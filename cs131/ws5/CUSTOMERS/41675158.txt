US	41675158	R12FVWC56ZB2NK	1582404879	999113364	The Walking Dead, Vol. 3: Safety Behind Bars	Books	4	4	6	N	N	Locked up, with nowhere to go	The Walking Dead is one of those series that impresses with how consistent it is.  I personally gave all 3 volumes ratings of 4 stars because I feel they're equally good.  Unlike most other comic books, each volume is NOT its separate entity, this is meant to be one continuous story and if Kirkman goes on for a lot longer (as he seems to promise in the foreward) this could very well become the biggest, longest epic in zombie fiction history.<br /><br />Story: Tired of being cramped in their RV in their never-ending run from the zombies, our group of survivors stumble upon a site that gives them great hope: a large prison, surrounded by a fence.  Sure, there's a few zombies left crawling in there but once those are cleaned up, it does appear to be a safe place from the outside world.  Not to mention that the place is packed to the rafters with canned food and such amenities as an endless supply of beds, an exercise gym, a laundry room.  But what happens when madness slowly starts to take over, when safety from harm is not enough?  What happens when the humans start turning on themselves and one of them is found to be a cold-blooded killer?  All of a sudden, the ghouls outside are the least of their worries.<br /><br />I do admit to still missing original artist Tony Moore's sweeping full-page pictures but his replacement does do a commendable job and comes into his own here.  The prison was extremely well done and detailed.  One thing I found bizarre however was that Rick's wife Lori all of a sudden looked very different, almost like she's of a different ethnicity.  I wonder if that was done on purpose or not.<br /><br />At the heart of this volume is the concept of settling in and finding a home as the people are tired of running.  Human emotions are at the forefront here as they were in volume 2, the focus being placed on Rick, who is becoming increasingly enraged and on the verge of snapping.  Many others are also losing their grip on sanity and key figures in this volume die.  Needless to say, it is very grim.  Kirkman and Adlard really are masters at making us feel the misery of its survivors.  Grime, stink, dirty clothes, flies buzzing everywhere.  They are living in a world of crap, and we as readers definitely feel it and SEE it because it's a comic.<br /><br />But just like in previous volumes, Kirkman delivers the gory goods.  Just when we as readers start to feel like it's focusing too much on characters and get thirsty for action, out of the corner will pop in some zombies.  This series has not skipped a beat since it's debut.  As we get to know the characters we feel more attached and I can't wait to see where Kirkman will lead us next.  Thankfully, 6 months wait between volumes is something I should be able to endure.res in this volume die.  Needless to say, it is very grim.

He said that in light of this, he wanted not so much to focus on violence and gore but on the human dynamics of people trapped in a zombiefied world, how they survive, how they stay sane, how they choose to live.  While reading this intro I got a little worried that Kirkman would write an overtly emotional tale.  Let&#8217;s face it, we all want gut-munching and gore in our zombie tales don&#8217;t we?  Not to fear, while the human/emotional side is ambivalent, Kirkman and illustrator Tony Moore throw in enough of the red stuff to satisfy the most hardcore horror fan.  In fact, The Walking Dead strikes just the right balance between horror and human emotions that I&#8217;ve seen in an undead tale since, well, Dawn of the Dead.<br /><br />Rick Grimes is a celebrated police officer with a loving wife and son who lives a pretty normal life.  Then one day he gets shot in the chest while in the line of duty and lands in a hospital.  When he wakes up from his coma roughly a month later, he discovers that the world around him has changed in a dramatic way: the streets are empty and desolate, with trash and debris scattered all over the place.  There are no humans in the streets.  There are, however plenty of flesh-eating ghouls, zombies, whatever you want to call them.  Rick goes back to his house and finds his family missing.  When he gets word from a neighbor that they might be in Atlanta, he hits the road from Kentucky to Atlanta.  What he sees on his way there are horrors beyond belief&#8230;<br /><br />While I found the dialogue at times to be awkward and stilted (this is a comic book after all), Kirkman&#8217;s real strength as a writer is his imagination, especially in the variety of obstacles that he has his characters face.  As for the characters, he does a great job of fleshing them out, especially the camp survivors, he introduces us to about ten new characters at once.  It&#8217;s a lot to absorb at first but he develops them well and we warm up to them quickly.  This first volume is a great introduction to the series and covered a whole lot of ground.  We get the hero waking up and being thrust into a lost world, the hero travelling the highways and discovering myriad horrors on it, the hero arriving into the city and discovering even way more horrors and finally the hero meeting up with a group of survivors who have the same simple goal as him: staying alive.  What&#8217;s left?  I imagine the second volume will have Rick and the rest of the survivors traveling across the country together in search of hope.  Should be a great ride, and I&#8217;ll definitely be on board to experience it.cters face.

US	41675158	R2QXOCFWAIO7AG	1582404135	593518819	The Walking Dead, Vol. 2: Miles Behind Us	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Braving the zombie-infested highways	The first Walking Dead volume was a sensational debut that introduced us to a world overrun by a strange plague that turned the populace into zombies.  A group of survivors in the rural Midwest headed to Atlanta thinking things would be better there only to find out that the city was festering grounds for the undead.  The survivors set up a camp on the outside limits of the city, waiting their turn and figuring out that if they were close to a major city then at least once the National Guard came to rescue people they would be seen, being close to a major city and all.<br /><br />In this second volume, the surviving group, resigned that the national guard might be a pipe dream and that no one is coming to save them, decide to leave the campsite near Atlanta and instead hit the road cross-country in their RV in hopes of finding normal civilization or at least a safe place to shelter and start a new life.  About 20 miles outside of Atlanta, they stumble upon an abandoned gated community called the Wiltshire Estates.  Thinking they have found safety, they clean up the houses and occupy them.  But of course, Wiltshire Estates turns out to not be as abandoned as they thought and the place is crawling with Zombies.  How will they survive this turn?<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when opening this second volume is that while creator Robert Kirkman is always still behind the wheels as the writer, the illustrator has changed this second time around, with Tony Moore replaced by the tandem of Charlie Adlard & cliff Rathburn.  While the new tandem have consciously drawn in a similar style than their predecessor for continuity, subtle differences can be noticed.  Todd&#8217;s strength was painting unsettling images and sweeping full-page apocalyptic landscapes.  His pictures were epic, atmospheric and chilling.  Adlard&Rathburn for the most part make away with this and draw the comic book in the more linear, square-box style of your typical comic book.  While I miss Moore&#8217;s work and gory images, I do believe the new illustrators have done a commandable job filling in for him.<br /><br />The absence of Tony Moore-type gore might not be the illustrators&#8217; faults here, for it looks as though writer/creator Robert Kirkman intentionally was trying to focus more on story and character development this time around.  Many new characters are introduced. Lori and Rick and their son Carl&#8217;s bond is as strong as ever in the face of adversity.  And the rest of the survivors are all trying to be as strong as possible given the circumstances.  Interestingly enough the physical pairing and mating of the survivors is becoming a prevalent theme in this novel and Kirkman is not afraid to be demonstrative about it.  It amuses me how Kirkman is willing to throw in some nudity or obscene cusswords at the most inadvertent moments.  When young Glenn finally meets a woman and the way they are so straightforward about what they&#8217;re after had me laughing my heart out as I have trouble picturing any kind of woman being so straightforward with a stranger about sexuality as she was.<br /><br />The relative absence of gore and zombie action in this second volume did little to deter my interest.  Really, a volume like this was necessary in order to get us further acquainted with the numerous characters and get us to feel for them and in doing this Kirkman definitely succeeded.  I thoroughly enjoyed Volume 2 of this series and am eagerly awaiting the third volume.  This is shaping up to be a truly epic series and I have no doubt that Kirkman will return to the gory stuff in volume 3 &#8220;safety behind bars&#8221; which will involve the survivors holing up in a fenced prison.

US	41675158	R3Q8L51M4E6M7	0843954159	160204437	City of the Dead	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Delivers the gore groceries	In 2004, newcomer Brian Keene gave the literary horror world a real shot in the arm with the release of his first novel &#8220;The Rising&#8221;, an apocalyptic zombie novel with an end-of-the-world scenario.  Although this type of fiction had been done countless times before in films (Romero et al) it was the first time we had scene a horror novel with these types of Romero-style zombies executed so well .  And thankfully, &#8220;The Rising&#8221; was gory.  It was fast-paced.  It was vulgar.  It was also a huge hit, as Keene won a Bram Stoker award for best first novel.  Of course, us Keene fans ended flooding his mail with countless letters demanding a sequel.  We wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.  And although it can&#8217;t help but feel like a bit of deja vu this time around, &#8220;City of the dead&#8221; nonetheless delivers the goods, and the guts, in a big way.<br /><br />&#8220;City of the dead&#8221; is in many ways not so much a sequel, rather a direct continuation of the events that occurred in &#8220;The Rising&#8221;.  In the first novel, Jim Thurmond had traveled hundreds of miles from West Virginia to New Jersey through zombie-infested highways to find his son Danny.  Alongside him were a black preacher named Martin and an ex-hooker named Frankie. In this second novel, the action starts off at a New Jersey suburb  where the three rescue Danny from the house and the stranglehold of the zombies.  As the neighborhood is infested with the undead they hit the road once more and are drawn to a massive skyscraper in the New York skyline that gives them hope that it might contain human survivors since it is the city&#8217;s only illuminated building.<br /><br />The building, as we later find out, is owned by multi-billionaire Darren Ramsey.  Ramsey had the skyscraper built after the terrorist attacks on New York City and designed it to be a veritable fortress that can supposedly withstand earthquakes, tornados even a direct hit by an airplane. Can it withstand the attack of millions of undead zombies trying to get in?  Our new group of human arrivals sure hope so&#8230;<br /><br />Again, Keene impresses with his ability to add a fresh new spin on zombie lore.  These are zombies that are able to drive cars, tanks, use guns.  They even talk and taunt their soon-to-be victims.  And it&#8217;s not just the shell of humans that become ravenous flesh-hungry creatures.  The animals succumb to it too, and &#8220;City of the dead&#8221; has several unforgettable scenes where for instance humans are attacked by undead rats in NYC&#8217;s sewer system or by a flock of undead birds.  And gorehounds will not be disappointed.  Keene loads his novel with endless amounts of scenes where humans and zombies alike get dispatched in gruesome fashion.<br /><br />I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a huge sense of despair and nihilism in this second novel.  As the story unfolds, things get relentlessly grim and hopeless for the humans.  Zombies, far, far outweigh the human side and living conditions (as well as the mental health of the remaining survivors) deteriorate to the point where even the survivors wonder if it&#8217;s worth living.  At least in The Rising, scientists, militia and survivor camps made it feel like there was still hope for the human side.  In &#8220;City of the dead&#8221; that hope is squashed to pieces, and Keene is an expert at making us feel the paranoia and despair.<br /><br />However, as is the case with most pulp horror creations, not everything is gold and I do feel inclined to point out some of the novel&#8217;s deficiencies.  Keene&#8217;s character development is way too cardboard for my liking.  We never get to gain much of an understanding of what makes his characters tick, or about their past or what the deteriorated world means to them on an emotional level.  Even Jim Thurmond, supposedly the novel&#8217;s central character, is woefully underdeveloped and his robotic, single-minded obsession with keeping his son safe becomes tiresome after a while.  And while I appreciate Keene&#8217;s efforts to go into an explanation of the roots behind the plague, some of the stuff he came up with was just wild.  The Siqqusim?  The Void?  Spy rodents?  To be honest, I think I would have preferred he stay away from clumsy half-baked explanations like these and let the nightmarish world envelop the reader.<br /><br />So is &#8220;City of the dead&#8221; perfect?  No, but one thing it is assured to do is give any zombie fan a huge adrenaline rush.  Keene might not be a literary genius but his ability to entertain and shock with gory descriptions is nearly unmatched in today&#8217;s horror genre.  It&#8217;s too bad that the ending of this novel doesn&#8217;t automatically open a door to a sequel the way The Rising did but who knows, we can always cross our fingers.with keeping his son safe becomes tiresome after a while.

US	41675158	R26XDEBMDUX804	0843949163	214085109	In the Dark	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Another great one from the master	Laymon has so many novels that it becomes hard to differentiate or compare them but I definitely believe that &#8220;In the Dark&#8221; stands as one of his best.  Maybe not a Laymon top five but probably one that cracks the top 10 (remember, Laymon has close to 40 novels to his name).  What makes In the Dark so good?  The usual Laymon staples: Breakneck pacing, intrigue, nudity, violence.  This is one of those Laymons where the pages fly by and you put everything else on hold because you just must finish.<br /><br />Jane is a librarian at the Donnerville library.  Nothing much happens in the quiet library until the day Jane finds an envelope containing a fifty dollar bill and a note (signed by MOG, &#8220;master of games&#8221;) instructing her to &#8220;Look homeward, angel&#8221;.  Knowing that this is the title of a Thomas Wolfe novel, she pulls that off the shelf, only to find a one hundred dollar bill with yet another note of instruction and a promise to double the payment.  As the adventures become more and more thrilling and the payments keep getting larger, Jane gets seriously hooked on the game.  But soon the game starts getting nasty, forcing Jane into actions that are immoral, unethical, criminal.  Despite the money, Jane knows that she needs to pull out of this game.  Only one problem:  MOG won&#8217;t let her.<br /><br />Laymon keeps us on our toes as he makes each MOG challenge more perverse and dangerous than the last.  I couldn&#8217;t wait to see what MOG had in store for Jane next.  Jane is really well fleshed out as a character and so is Brace, the guy she meets while on these adventures.  Jane&#8217;s dilemma is interesting: as a quiet and average working gal, a librarian no less, why does she keep engaging in these dangerous acts?  Hellooo, wouldn&#8217;t you do it once the payments reach $1000, then $2000, then $4000?  Before you know it you&#8217;re at 10k and counting.  As a member of the slaving working class, I totally would have done the same as Jane no matter how immoral the acts.  But like Jane, I would have stopped short at committing murder.  I felt a strong association to Jane as a character.<br /><br />While some readers might think it hard to believe that a simple shy librarian such as Jane would turn into such a daredevil I can&#8217;t say that I disagree but obviously these people are not regular Laymon readers.  Females have always been tough as nails in Laymon novels.  Even the most beautiful, sexy, feminine women in his novels will stop at nothing to get what they desire.  Although maybe a little more restrained than, say, Alice in &#8220;After Midnight&#8221; or Linda in &#8220;The Night Show&#8221;, Jane is one chick who is not afraid to use guns, weapons, deception, her body or anything else to advance in the game.<br /><br />A few things are frustratingly left unexplained such as who is MOG?  Why did he target Jane specifically?  How is he able to pay out all of these outrageous sums of money?  What kind of return does he get out of such a huge investment?  Laymon leaves a lot of loose ends but I wouldn&#8217;t let any of this bother you if you&#8217;re a fan of his.  In the Dark is quite a ride and a great place to start to experience the unique, albeit unsophisticated literary genius that was Richard Laymon.e the same as Jane no matter how immoral the acts.

US	41675158	R32NQSF3KFHBMZ	0843954124	996157105	Flesh Gothic	Books	4	0	1	N	N	Smut-fueled twist on a familiar theme	It used to be that Ed Lee books were morbid experiences of gross-out horror, graphic and gory chunkblowers that satisfied those of us who seek the most extreme in horror.  Not only did Lee satisfy in the nudity & gore departments but his stories were engaging and fleshed out really well.  Problem is, his books did not come cheap and were published by smaller companies that charged an ungodly amount for his short paperbacks.  Thanks to Leisure horror, all that changed.  All of a sudden new Ed Lee paperbacks could be bought at regular mass-market price and were available in most bookstores.  But these new Lee novels were nowhere near as graphic as previous ones.  Now, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be a bad thing; every author eventually matures and goes on to write differently and expand their horizons a little bit, we all understand that.  I just can&#8217;t help but express some disappointment at the quality of Lee&#8217;s novels so far that have been published under the Leisure banner.  Aside from the outstanding &#8220;City Infernal&#8221;, his other works have been lackluster.  &#8220;Angel Infernal&#8221; was sub-par.  &#8220;Monstrosity&#8221; was sub-par.  &#8220;The Messenger&#8221; was sub-par.  So where does &#8220;Flesh Gothic&#8221; stand?  While still not approaching the quality of &#8220;City Infernal&#8221;, it easily stands as his second-best Leisure title.<br /><br />The Hildreth mansion in Florida was the property of Reginald Hildreth, a reclusive and  porn-obsessed millionaire.  So obsessed was Hildreth with the pleasures of the flesh that he operated a porn studio in his own mansion.  Then on one fateful night, Hildreth apparently went crazy and slaughtered all the porn actors in the mansion before turning the knife onto himself.  The mansion has been abandoned since then and a group of people including psychics and a detective are sent to investigate the apparent paranormal activity that is still occurring in the mansion.  Could it be that old Reginald Hildreth is not really dead but still alive within the walls of the mansion?  Or that some of his deceased porn stars&#8217; spirits are still within the walls of the mansion?<br /><br />Early Amazon reviews of Flesh Gothic seemed to promise a gory Ed Lee, a return to his uncompromising roots.  Did I read the same novel?  Whoever thinks that this constitutes a gory horror novel has clearly not read enough of these types of books.  Not much gore here, people die rather quickly and unspectacularly and a lot of this is done in flashbacks or through the eyes of someone watching a DVD, somewhat reducing the shock impact.  But bashing this novel simply due to the relative absence of extreme gore would be unfair to Lee, as he still gives us a high quality and entertaining horror novel.  His characterization in particular I felt was quite impressive, and also the way he sets up his story and layers it with intrigue.  Like a master chess player, he carefully plots his next moves and creates characters that we like and that are intriguing despite the fact that most are porn and coke-addled scum of society.<br /><br />While lacking in gore, Flesh Gothic is certainly not lacking in the sex category.  The porn industry twist in this book is interesting as it gives Lee a darkly comical stage to flesh out some of his trademark debaucheries.  Think &#8220;Orgazmo&#8221; for the horror-lit set.  While it&#8217;s true that the haunted house mansion investigated by paranormal experts has been done countless times, the porn industry spin makes it unique and plays to Lee&#8217;s strengths as a shock writer.  The mansion is very well created, with lots of rooms and unique atrocities found within those rooms.  In the end, I must say I was quite impressed with Flesh Gothic.  While not the gorefest I was hoping for, I still found a very well executed horror tale that kept me burning the pages until after bedtime.that old Reginald Hildreth is not really dead but still alive within the walls of the mansion?

US	41675158	R3K5X4GSOTC28Q	0786015802	514785227	The Manor	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Atmospheric but uneventful	Scott Nicholson is an author who has enjoyed a great deal of success from the beginning of his publishing career.  His first novel &#8220;The Red Church&#8221; won a Stoker for best first novel and his popularity has steadily increased since then.  If a comparison were to be made with another famous horror author, I would have to point out Bentley Little.  The first obvious similarity is in the titles, which are always two words, beginning with &#8220;The&#8221;.  Also, the setting always takes place in a small-town that is increasingly overcome with a malevolent supernatural force.  But while I admire Nicholson&#8217;s work so far, in my opinion his novels fall short of Little&#8217;s, clearly the master of this type of horror.  &#8220;The Manor&#8221; is Nicholson&#8217;s third novel.<br /><br />&#8220;The Manor&#8221; was built in 1902 by Ephram Corban, a wealthy if somewhat reclusive artist.  It was built high in the Appalachian mountains and intended to serve as a muse for artists looking for inspiration.  Once old man Corban passed away, The Manor was turned into an artists&#8217; retreat and run by Corban&#8217;s daughters and granddaughters.  In this story, we follow a group of about a dozen artists including photographers, painters, sculptors on a trip to The Manor, who seek both relaxation and inspiration for their work.  But some of these artists soon come to realize that the Manor is haunted grounds and that the spirit of Ephram Corban is still very much alive.  Unfortunately for them, being nestled high into the Appalachian mountains surrounded by endless miles of wilderness means there&#8217;s not much of a chance for escape&#8230;<br /><br />I would like to start off by saying that I loved &#8220;The Red Church&#8221;, Nicholson&#8217;s first novel.  It was explosive, original, scary and one of the best horror debuts I had ever laid eyes on.  But I can&#8217;t help but get the feeling Nicholson might be regressing a little bit.  Although I haven&#8217;t read his second novel &#8220;The Harvest&#8221; the general concensus among most Amazon reviewers seems to be that it is a less than spectacular effort.  &#8220;The Manor&#8221; had great potential and the storyline seemed to promise something great but it didn&#8217;t deliver on its promise.  For one, it just isn&#8217;t very scary.  &#8220;The Red Church&#8221; dealt with religious fanatics, a truly scary concept, horror novel or otherwise.  But in &#8220;The Manor&#8221; we get a group of elderly women worshipping an old dead man.  Eh&#8230;not quite as frightening.  What turned me off as well was how slow the novel was progressing.  It took until past the halfway mark of this 320-page novel until any of the characters even began to feel a sense of menace or that anything was wrong.  The ending was admittedly explosive but the buildup was way too slow.  I also felt like Nicholson focused too much of his attention on the same handful of characters all the time, even though there were over a dozen guests at The Manor.<br /><br />What made me still enjoy this novel to a certain extent is Nicholson&#8217;s gifts of description and setting.  The mist-shrouded cover with the full moon on it doesn&#8217;t lie; this is a supremely atmospheric novel.  I felt like I could practically breathe the mountain air, smell the pines, hear the crickets.  This has become one of Nicholson&#8217;s specialties, to engulf us in an Appalachian mountain setting, and he does it extremely well.  I&#8217;ll definitely keep reading Nicholson since he writes the type of horror fiction that I enjoy, I just hope he writes with more of a sense of urgency and makes more things happen next time around.8217;t read his second novel &#8220;The Harvest&#8221; the general concensus among most Amazon reviewers seems to be that it is a less than spectacular effort.  &#8220;The Manor&#8221; had great potential and the storyline seemed to promise something great but it didn&#8217;t deliver on its promise.

The average customer review at Amazon is a perfect 5.  Just about every big-shot horror critic/novelist heaps glorious and luminous praise on this novel.  Well, consider me an anomaly.  I am an avid reader of horror novels but this one just didn't cut it for me.<br /><br />The small southern town of Kingdom Come is a decaying swamp backwater that seems to attract the lowest form of life around.  Violent bikers, nymphs, prostitutes and drug addicts constitute the bulk of its charming populace.  The novel's central character and narrator, Thomas, is one of the richest men in town due to the inheritance he earned when his parents passed on.  He lives in a large mansion with his freakish 3 brothers, conjoined triplets who have three bodies but share a single brain.  One day with the arrival in town of a strange young mute girl who is seemingly abandoned, Thomas hires a private investigator to uncover the mysteries behind her arrival.  Along with the uncovering of that mystery, Thomas will discover that there's way more dirt behind Kingdom Come's murky swamp.<br /><br />Wheww! Trying to write a plot summary for this novel was not an easy task.  See, Piccirilli is literally all over the map with this novel.  There's little to no narrative coherence or plot structure.  Instead of focusing on creating a story, Piccirilli seems content in just slapping together hallucinatory scenes about the everyday lives of the town's populace.  Even at a mere 225 pages, reading this felt like a chore.  Piccirilli's writing style is one that I found very difficult to absorb, not to mention trying to keep up with all the characters.  There's so many that I would often find myself forgetting where I'd first read of this character and Piccirilli never makes any attempt to refresh the reader's memory once a minor character who hasn't appeared for dozens pages suddenly makes an appearance.<br /><br />It's too bad because Piccirilli really is a fantastic writer in the technical sense.  His prose can be beautiful and poetic, invoking such legends of the Southern gothic as Flannery O'connor and Faulkner.  I was also impressed with the uniqueness of the town and of some of the characters he was creating.  And yes, his ability to make us feel like a part of the Southern swamp setting is impressive.  But for a novel (especially horror) to be entertaining it needs more than artistic or creative writing but also a coherent plot structure and in this Piccirilli fails miserably.  I am baffled by all the praise thrown this novel's way and will be even more so if Piccirilli wins another Stoker this year.  I used to think that Peter Straub was horror's most overrated author.

US	41675158	R1J828TI8MUNBB	0843952008	832534280	Fears Unnamed	Books	4	3	3	N	N	4 tales of the apocalypse	A book like \\"Fears Unnamed\\" was a real treat for me, an avid lover of apocalyptic tales.  I must have read over a hundred horror novels in my lifetime and when I'm asked which were my favourites I'm always coming back to books like \\"Swan Song\\", \\"The Stand\\", \\"I am Legend\\".  Whether it be sci-fi or horror, I find that end-of-the-world stories always seem to breed the most imaginative concepts from the best authors out there.  Tim Lebbon in particular has a reputation as a writer of such apocalyptic tales and in \\"Fears Unnamed\\" he presents to us 4 short novels with end-of-the-world scenarios.<br /><br />The first story, \\"Remnants\\" is about an archaeologist and his childhood pal who travel in an isolated part of Africa and discover an underground \\"City of the dead\\".  The archaeologist is obsessed with the idea of locating his dead son but before, he must wade his way through all of the horrors that lurk in this seemingly interminable underground hell.  A great opener, although I wish Lebbon had developed his idea more fully and had more of the story take place in the city of the dead.  Still, I loved the philosophical paintings throughout the story about growing up without selling out your values and living life to the fullest.  I give Remnants a 4/5.<br /><br />In \\"White\\", six young vacationing adults find themselves trapped in their cabin due to a seemingly unending snow-storm.  The nearest village is ten miles away and walking that distance in the storm seems unfathomable but staying in the cabin could be worse as there are murderous white \\"shapes\\" outside, trying to make their way onto the cabin and feast on them.  Lebbon really hits his stride here delivering a story that is creepy, claustrophobic and very suspenseful.  As a Canadian to whom 3 feet of snow is often a reality, this one really hit home for me.  White gets a 4/5.<br /><br />In \\"The Unfortunate\\", a man escapes death when he is the sole survivor of a plane crash.  But soon he will discover that escaping death has a huge price as family and friends close to him start dying and getting into horrible accidents.  The weakest of the 4 tales, \\"The Unfortunate\\" is written in a highly experimental and should I say it, pretentious writing style.  I almost quit on it 10 pages in, but it those get better.  Still, there is something eerily familiar about it (Final Destination anyone?).  This story I would rate a 3/5.<br /><br />The last story, \\"Naming of parts\\" is the best one.  In a world gone mad, a boy and his parents set off on an adventure to locate Mandy, their teenaged girl who ran away a few weeks ago.  Much of the population (including the animals) has been infested with a strange disease that is making them kill and eat the remains of everything they come in contact with.  This tale was an absolute blast, a gory and fun ride.  Fans of Brian Keene's \\"The Rising\\" especially will get a kick out of this.  This one is a definite 5/5.<br /><br />Overall a fine collection that I recommend to all horror fans.  While some stories are better than others and there are a few rough patches here and there there is no doubt that Lebbon has what it takes to be a major force in horror literature for years to come.escaping death has a huge price as family and friends close to him start dying and getting into horrible accidents.

As a veteran reader of Laymon I'll be the first one to tell you that the man has written just as many misses as he has hits.  For every classic like \\"Island\\" or \\"The Cellar\\" there are turkeys like \\"Endless Night\\", books so trivial and banal I almost feel like I should wrap them in cardboard.  But the genius of Laymon is this: even with the stinkers, he keeps us reading.  I will never accuse a Laymon novel, no matter how dumb, of being a slow or boring read.  \\"The Stake\\" falls somewhere in between.  The quality of Laymon's writing is excellent and the setup was good however he never develops his concept to the fullest.  What could have been an explosive horror novel somehow falls flat.<br /><br />Larry Dunbar is a writer of gruesome horror novels.  Despite the grotesqueries he writes, Larry is just about the nicest, most well-mannered person you could ever meet.  He lives in a quiet suburban home with his teenaged daughter and loving wife.  One day on a road trip exploring a ghost town with his wife and two of their friends, Larry stumbles upon a corpse buried under the floor of a hotel.  Turns out the corpse is (apparently) a female vampire with a stake in her heart.  On a return trip with his friend Pete, Larry lugs the corpse back home and sets off to write a non-fictional account of this supposed vampire.  But what if the vampire is not really dormant but ready to come back to life?  What happens if you pull the stake?  Larry is about to find out...<br /><br />The central character being a horror writer, there are definite undertones of self-referentiality to this tale.  The wife and daughter, the struggles with publishers & editors, the setbacks associated with being a writer of gruesome horror, I mean really Laymon is just writing about himself here.  The self-referentiality doesn't bother me that much, at least he's not using his horror writer character as a veil attempt to pepper his novel with his own opinions (a la Bentley Little) but it does become very cheesy after a while.  That's too bad because his writing quality is top-notch here; he's not filling pages with dialogue, but letting setting and mood take over.  He effectively juggles two separate storylines involving different characters and blends them together in the end quite nicely.<br /><br />I guess my main quelm with \\"The Stake\\" is how mellow of a horror novel it ends up being.  There is practically none of the violence and nudity Laymon's become so famous (or infamous) for.  Even worse, there's not much action either and the marketing of this book as a vampire novel is slightly off-putting.  I mean a real vampire novel would have things to scare the reader such as oh I don't know...vampires?  There is only one vampire in this entire novel and she spends the whole time lying motionless in a coffin with a stake in her heart while the rest of the characters run around dealing with all sorts of unrelated things.  I had high hopes for \\"The Stake\\" especially since I wanted Laymon to redeem himself after disappointing me so much with his other vampire misfire \\"Bite\\".  Oh well, I guess bloodsuckers were not meant to be the man's specialty.y cheesy after a while.

On one fateful night, everything you hold so dear is shattered to pieces and your life as you knew it will never be the same.  That fateful night can never be reversed however being strong-willed, you decide to keep your head up and charge into whatever life holds.  After all, you have already lost so much and nothing that happens at this point on could be worse.  WRONG.  Imagine that you and your sister are sent to live with a distant aunt, one who hates you to the core simply for being a member of the female species and who is intent on doing her best to shatter any resolve you have in moving ahead with life by humiliating and punishing you both verbally and physically.  Not only that but your nephews and the neighborhood kids have no intent in helping or protecting you, in fact they want to hurt you just as badly.  Your horrors have just begun...<br /><br />Ketchum's novel explores the darkest recesses of the human mind in a novel that is more terrifying than I could have ever imagined.  He sets his novel up like a master chess player, first warming up our hearts with a coming-of age story set in 1950's suburbia about a boy David (The narrator of the story) who falls in love with the cute girl next door.  Although it takes a while to get there, once the novel gets to the little girl's suffering there is no way back.  As the horrors unfold, you wonder how much further Ketchum could possibly take it as he exposes us to some of the worse cruelties imaginable, every subsequent act more barbaric and vicious than the last.<br /><br />The narrator David does not participate in any of the atrocities against the girl but in a way what he does is almost as worse; he watches, silently, without ever telling anyone.  Truth be told David could be one of any number of children; he is 12 years old, shy and reserved.  Not many people at that age have the resolve to play hero or savior in the face of this kind of moral dilemma.  It's as though Ketchum is trying to remind us of that while pointing the finger and saying: \\"Remember when you were twelve, how would you have acted?\\"<br /><br />One of the few flaws of Ketchum's story is in having so many people participate in the cruelties towards the victim.  I don't buy for a second that so many young people in middle class suburbia (or anywhere for that matter) would remain silent in the face of such unspeakable acts, let alone be willing participants.  But clearly Ketchum's intent  with this novel was to be as shocking as possible and that is something he most definitely achieves. Before thinking that you can distance yourself emotionally from this horror novel because it is a work of fiction think again: it's based on a true story.  Still, don't hesitate to read \\"The girl next door\\". It's not a novel to \\"enjoy\\" but rather an emotional and heartfelt tale that reminds us of our moral obligations as decent human beings.dilemma.

US	41675158	R2ZMFL8UDNJYAH	038081093X	604551094	Excavation	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Non-stop action that bores	At this point James Rollins' novels have all had a somewhat similar premise which is high octane adventure in an exotic setting.  Other Rollins novels have taken place in the Arctic (Ice Hunt&Subterranean), the Saudi desert (Sandstorm), the Amazon river (Amazon), and in this novel Rollins delves into the lush jungles of South America.  This type of adventure novel definitely appeals to me and I was looking forward to reading my first Rollins novel.  Unfortunately I believe I picked the wrong novel to get started as Excavation is a sub-par novel in many respects.<br /><br />The plot is messy and all over the map but I'll try to simplify it as much as humanly possible.  Deep in the jungles of Peru, a team of student researchers uncover an Incan temple that seems to store many ancient artifacts and riches beyond anyone's imagination.  However the temple is not deserted like the researchers previously thought it was.  Inside, there are still ancient Incan tribes who will do anything to protect their shrine.  The researchers are not the only ones interested in exploring the depths of the temple but also money-hungry monks whose ancestors were Spanish conquistadors who in the past were in a bloody war with the Incas.  With these three groups going at it someone is bound to get hurt...<br /><br />This novel really should have been good as it has an exotic setting, many mysteries and yes tons of action, although it doesn't kick into high gear until halfway through.  The first half of this book is very pedestrian, mostly involving scientists theorizing about the artifacts and the lost tribes.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  Michael Crichton, to use an obvious example, is able to do this in an entertaining style and his expertise really shines through in his writing.  I never got that feeling with Rollins.<br /><br />Where the book kind of picks off is once Rollins finally gets down to what he does best: writing action.  I admit that many scenes were supremely entertaining, especially once he brings us into an underground world of tunnels and mazes filled with menacing creatures.  What kind of bothered me however was how much this all felt like a movie script.  You can almost hear Rollins begging to the folks in Tinseltown \\"Come on guys make this into a movie, please?\\"  Maybe Rollins should consider a career as a scriptwriter instead.<br /><br />Yet even action can get boring after a while and this happens during \\"Excavation\\".  Despite the non-stop action I found that I didn't want to read the book in anything longer than 10-page increments.  There's something wrong with this.  Is it Rollins' writing style?  Or that his characters are so underdeveloped and stereotypical that we don't give a darn what happens to them?  Oh well, I gave Rollins a try and I must say I am very disappointed with what I've read.  But I'm not giving up on Rollins just yet since he writes the kind of stuff that I love.  I just hope that he's written better novels than this one.entertaining, especially once he brings us into an underground world of tunnels and mazes filled with menacing creatures.

US	41675158	R2BY47TPPJ1P73	0812579259	606443502	The Keep	Books	4	25	26	N	N	Good but overrated	I picked this book up because I kept hearing that it was a true classic of horror.  It also seemed to stand out among fans as being Wilson's best work.  While I enjoyed The Keep and agree that it is a very solid novel, I found that there were way too many flaws and annoyances to grant it such status.<br /><br />During World War II, a German SS squad take over the Dinu Pass in Romania.  Nestled deep in the Transylvania Alps, it is a direct link to Russia and the Germans want to solidify their position in the pass should relations between them and Russia deteriorate.  Within the pass there is a castle-like structure referred to as \\"The Keep\\", which is where the Nazis barricade themselves and spend the night.  But every night, a Nazi dies at the hands of an evil, inhuman apparition.  Is it a ghost?  A vampire?  Dumbfounded, they bring in a Romanian professor who is an expert on local folklore (and who also happens to be Jewish) to shed light on the situation.<br /><br />Mainly due to its setting in WWII, I was expecting this novel to be a relatively complex read for a horror novel but it's not at all.  It reads very easily, and the WWII setting is clearly only a backdrop and things like war and politics are rarely discussed.  It's really more of a pulp novel about an inhuman monster battling human monsters (The Nazis).  Okay so who are we as readers supposed to root for?  I wasn't sure myself.  What I found original here is how Wilson suddenly made the monster into a tangible presence halfway through the book.  It was fascinating to read about the monster's origin and history.  Wilson also packs the first half of his book with loads of suspense.  As the monster kills one Nazi per night, readers are kept on their toes as they wonder which will be the next Nazi to suffer a horrible death.<br /><br />Now for the bad: The suspense, horror and intrigue Wilson built in the first half of the book almost completely disappears in the second half.  The monster seldom kills people, the 3 new characters introduced are annoying (professor, his daughter and Glenn), and the entire mood of the story changes.  It's not even a horror story anymore but makes a complete 180-degree turn into a medieval fantasy novel of ancient good versus evil.  Add to that the sickly sweet romance between two of the characters and it completely kills the buildup the novel had.  These romance scenes were incredibly cheesy, the writing punctuated by exclamation points all the time like \\"Oh, how I love him so!\\" or \\"How strong his arms were!\\" and made me feel like I was reading a dime-a-dozen romance novel from the supermarket shelves.<br /><br />I suspect those people proclaiming \\"The Keep\\" to be one of the best horror novels ever simply have not read that many horror novels.  I don't want to give the wrong impression however: I still think \\"The Keep\\" is a solid novel, therefore my 4-star rating.  It just didn't turn out to be the classic I was expecting it to be.ills people, the 3 new characters introduced are annoying (professor, his daughter and Glenn), and the entire mood of the story changes.

Now almost 35 years later comes the swan song to King's biggest literary undertaking, a work he admits that has been equally the most torturous and fulfilling of his illustrious career.  I personally agree with the many reviewers that said that the series took a nose-dive after the first 3 installments.  I particularly did not like entry#4, \\"The Wizard of Glass\\", which was a flashback to Roland's youth.  While well written, that chapter of the series served absolutely no point to the series and here's why;<br /><br />1)Most of the characters in that backstory died<br /><br />2)Those that did not die served absolutely no purpose in the rest of the tale (With the notable exception of Sheemie)<br /><br />3)Many of the characters we wanted most to read about (Roland's parents, his teacher Cort, Marten AKA Walter AKA Randall Flagg) were practically ignored<br /><br />4)Instead of focusing on important aspects of Roland's youth (Such as the above mentioned characters) it was about a love story when Roland was in his twenties.  Who cares?<br /><br />That book epitomized the criticism that King is too wordy and often writes things that are pointless.  While books#5 and 6 were an improvement, they still seemed too sedentary in nature to truly fulfill my love of reading the dark tower.  GET ON WITH IT KING! was starting to be my attitude towards the series.  Well, I am very glad to say that book#7 is utterly amazing and aside from book#3 The Waste Lands is the highest point of the series.  Like \\"The Waste Lands\\" this final entry is packed with action and adventure and we get the constant feeling that we are getting closer and closer to the tower.  It is surprisingly free of filler material for its massive size.  King finally gets down to serious business here.<br /><br />Why did I like book#7 so much?  Oh let me count thee ways...For one, I keep marveling at how King seamlessly intertwines the fictional elements of his story with events in the real world such as the events of Sept.11 and Stephen King's real-life brush with death in a 1999 accident when he was taking a walk and was hit by a van.  I guess he wasn't kidding around in epilogues of books #2 and #3 when he said he had no idea where the series is going to go next.  Also, this book attains levels of weirdness that were previously unimaginable (even by King standards).  But it's not the type of dream-induced, hallucinatory, todash BS weirdness that often turns me off of King's writing but instead the WEIRD is written in a straightforward no BS style and simply makes you gap in awe at the powers of King's unconventional imagination.<br /><br />The only thing that really bothered me was the way King brushed off major characters with the quick stroke of a pen.  But alas, all things must come to an end, even characters that have been with us for this long.  While the dark tower series is no more, the characters, language and scenes that King created will stay with me forever.  It is too bad that what had the potential to be the greatest epic since Tolkien fell short of that (due to books 4 through 6) but at least King served us one of the best books of his career in entry#7, say thankya.  And for those of you confused and disappointed with the ending I say this: Read Robert Browning's poem afterwards and read it carefully.  Ka is a wheel.ertwines the fictional elements of his story with events in the real world such as the events of Sept.11 and Stephen King's real-life brush with death in a 1999 accident when he was taking a walk and was hit by a van.

US	41675158	R2D0VU5NYDF7GG	0451458958	408989944	October Dreams:: A Celebration of Halloween	Books	4	5	7	N	N	All Hallow's eve!	I was attracted to this anthology for two main reasons.  For one, Halloween is by far my favorite holiday, and this book is 650 pages devoted exclusively to the witching season.  Second, I'm a huge horror lit fan as well and the genre talent involved in here is major league: Koontz, Straub, Brite, Campbell, Bradbury, the list goes on.  While the anthology has its highs and its not-so-highs (filler abounds here) there is no doubt that this is the definitive anthology devoted to the season.  If anyone knows of a better one please let me know.<br /><br />There are no less than 22 short stories in here and while some teeter the line of mediocrity there are no major duds.  Most of these tales go for spooks and scares and do succeed to a certain extent.  In \\"The Black Pumpkin\\" Dean Koontz gives us a pumpkin carver whose disturbing creations accurately mirror the foulness in the people who buy them.  Gahan Wilson's \\"Yesterday's Witch\\" and Ramsey Campbell's \\"The Trick\\" both feature old creaky women who the neighborhood kids think are witches.  Are these simply the delusional fantasies of kids with overactive imaginations?  No, in the end these witches prove to be real and the results are terrifying.<br /><br />One minor letdown for this fan of horror was the absence of any splatter, gore or bodily violence even despite the inclusion of notable rabble-rousing authors such as Richard Laymon and Jack Ketchum.  Another minor letdown is that out of these 22 tales the majority feature the same overall premise, that of trick-or-treating kids in middle class suburbia.  Some of these tales however are true originals that do steer clear of that well-beaten path and also happen to be the best the book has to offer.  My choice for the three top stories are:<br /><br />\\"Pay the ghost\\" by Tim Lebbon:  A young couple loses their daughter on Halloween.  To get her back, they must cross a ghettoized village of various atrocities.  Lebbon manages to paint an epic scope in 26 terrifying pages.<br /><br />\\"Buckets\\" by F. Paul Wilson:  Trick or Treaters at the door of a family doctor who runs an abortion clinic are carrying strange steel buckets instead of the standard pillow cases.  What's in the buckets and why is it the color of blood?  The fact that Wilson himself is a doctor (whose done abortions?) lends this tale a dose of morbid credibility.<br /><br />\\"Porkpie Hat\\" by Peter Straub: A jazz musician recalls a Halloween night from his childhood that began with trick-or-treating fun and ended in horror when him and his pals take a wrong turn and witness the back alley delivery of a child from a taboo union.  I first read this novella several years ago in the Straub anthology \\"Magic Terror\\" and still to this day it haunts me.<br /><br />As if the short stories weren't enough, this book also contains ramblings by popular writers recounting their favorite Halloween memories and in-depth essays detailing the best literature and horror movies devoted to the topic of Halloween.  Highly recommended for all you Halloween junkies out there.pages. <br /> <br />\\"Buckets\\" by F.

US	41675158	R3CXJOQTJZR1O4	0843946903	934186299	One Rainy Night	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Buckets of blood Laymon style	Richard Laymon novels are often a hit or miss affair.  For every classic like \\"Island\\", there's a dud like \\"Endless Night\\", and out of the 20 or so novels of his I've read I must admit that close to half were nothing to go nuts over.  But I have still found it worthwhile to slug over mediocre works of his because the payoff is that when you find a Laymon book that's good it's REAL good.  \\"One Rainy Night\\" is certainly one of his best, and it typifies the things that Laymon does best:  Fast-Paced action, buckets of gore, graphic body violence and evil-to-the-core villains.<br /><br />The setting takes place in the small California town of Bixby, where the peacefulness of the town is shattered overnight by a thick black rain that pours down and inexplicably turns its citizens into homicidal maniacs.  Citizens lucky enough to be indoors when the rain starts to pour are now faced with a more trying dilemma: stem the tide of ghouls trying to break in.<br /><br />A very simplistic plot it certainly is and Laymon keeps it straightforward throughout.  \\"One Rainy Night\\" has all the qualities of great b-movie horror, such as graphic gore, horny teenagers, a town sheriff, a small hicktown setting.  Comparisons to \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" are certainly just as the novel has many scenes of people barricading themselves inside in an attempt to ward off the creatures lurking outside.  He even attempts to lend credence to an otherwise unbelievable central concept (killer rain) by tying in the story with a voodoo-practicing elder man who put a spell on the town to avenge the death of his grandson.<br /><br />The entire events of the novel take place over one night, making it an engaging read with a fast pace.  Laymon's writing is very sharp, free of the often pointless dialogue that plagues some of his other works and he does an excellent job of instilling dread at the thought of the pouring rain.  He intertwines several different scenarios together with seamless ease, as characters who never crossed paths throughout the novel bond together towards the end to fight the rain-soaked maniacs.  Like many other Laymon novels, this will satisfy those horror fans looking for the literary equivalent of a fun horror b-movie.s characters who never crossed paths throughout the novel bond together towards the end to fight the rain-soaked maniacs.

US	41675158	R10GENLGBFPWGO	0451212800	43298823	The Resort	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Isolation and savagery	The Thurman family of five usually take their summer vacation in their homestate of California but this year is different.  Lowell and Rachel, along with their three sons, are attracted by brochures of The Reata, an exclusive spa in the Arizona desert that promises luxurious treatment at unbelievable discount rates.  At first everything is as promised with a great staff, great swimming pool and luxurious suites.  But soon the Thurmans come to realize not everything is well, as a series of bizarre events start to ruin the enjoyment of their stay.  As things worsen, the Thurmans want to bail out but what happens when their car mysteriously breaks down?  The Reata is completely isolated in the desert and they have nowhere to go.  They are trapped in The Reata whether they like it or not...<br /><br />This is Little's 16th novel and as someone who has read the vast majority of them I must say I'm extremely impressed with this latest one.  The formula is the same: a serene peaceful setting that slowly morphs into one of chaos and horror, but it's done better than most of his other works.  For one, \\"The Resort\\" was extremely funny.  His use of modern street jargon through the lens of his horny teenage characters was bang-on and very up-to-date.  And not since \\"The Store\\" has he thrown so many wild absurdities in his pages.  Some of the characters are priceless, especially \\"The Activities Coordinator\\" who will remind you of your worst gym teacher from hell.  He splits the guests at the resort into three tribes that are to compete against each other in the most sadistic sporting events imaginable.  And bailing out of these sporting events is simply not an option...<br /><br />The horror is accentuated by the sense of isolation that the guests at The Reata experience, as the resort is nowhere near a major town and with their cars tampered with they have nowhere to go.  With the three divided tribes, Little turns his novel into a yuppified Lord of the Flies, with middle-aged men and women turning to savagery in a desperate bid to survive amidst the chaos of the resort.  All in all, this is one of Little's best and most chaotic novels.  The only major problem I had with \\"The Resort\\" is a common problem with his other novels in that the supernatural elements of the story seem out of place and awkward within a setting that is meant to be of reality instead of the fantastical.  I know that Little's books require a suspension of disbelief but still an explanation as to the origins of the supernatural would help lend his story more credence.  Still, \\"The Resort\\" kept me entertained right until the end and wanting more.  Many have criticized Little's novels as being too similar but I wouldn't have it any other way, especially when they're this good.-aged men and women turning to savagery in a desperate bid to survive amidst the chaos of the resort.

US	41675158	R2RK6PBKUUN2IP	0917053044	769847591	Dead in the West	Books	5	6	7	N	N	The best of the best	For some strange reason Joe Lansdale often carried the tag of horror writer for many years which is peculiar since out of the 20 or so books of his, only \\"The Drive-In\\" and \\"Dead in the West\\" are horror novels.  Many of his novels are either westerns, hard-boiled mysteries or strange combinations of both.  Dead in the West is another unique crossover as only Lansdale can do, a short novel that seamlessly combines the western and horror genres to mold a \\"zombie western\\".  Let it be said that Dead in the West is one of the best and most unique contributions ever to the horror genre.<br /><br />Reverend Jeb Mercer is a man of god who has lost much of his faith due to the many unfortunate circumstances that have shaped his life.  Every once in a while Jeb still communicates with the lord and this time He has sent Jeb to the East Texas town of Mud Creek on a mission, a mission about what Jeb is uncertain but he boards his mule, packs his guns and heads over to the sleepy desert town.  Jeb will soon find out that the town has been cursed by an Indian shaman and that is why everyone in Mud Creek is turning into slow shuffling zombies.  Can the Reverend, a man of god who has lost his faith, save the town from the dark pits of hell that await?<br /><br />The ideas are great and truly original but it is Lansdale's writing that make this novel so exceptional.  He has a way with words and with humour that just jump at you and make you stare at the page in disbelief.  The dialogue is some of the funniest ever and all the words seem to flow seamlessly on the pages.  This is one of those novels that is very hard to put down unfinished.  On the surface, the plot seems like one of a pulpy dime novel but it has such a tight structure and sense of atmosphere that it becomes so much more.  This book has more treasures in 120 pages than most books of 400 pages could ever think of having.<br /><br />Most of the novel would be classified as a western until that is the invasion of zombies in the last 30 pages or so that turn it into a bloody, gory and extremely graphic zombie gut-muncher.  This is one of those gems that should never go out of print and should obtain classic status but because of how unconventional it is will forever remain an obscure cult anomaly. If you are a fan of Joe or horror in general what are you waiting for?  Hunt this book down, then settle into your favourite chair with a bowl of chili on the side and let Joe take you on for the ride of your life.mbies in the last 30 pages or so that turn it into a bloody, gory and extremely graphic zombie gut-muncher.

US	41675158	R1RA1Z0C7PY149	0843952040	875977385	Messenger	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Lee goes postal	The town of Dannelton is an idealic Florida community.  Great weather, friendly people, an overall peaceful and quaint little burg.  All of this changes when a female mailman named Marlene opens fire on the employees and patrons of the local post office, massacring 26 people.  Marlene was well liked around town , not at all the type of person to commit such a horrible crime.  But Marlene was under the orders of \\"The Messenger\\", an evil spirit that enters the minds of others and makes them commit unspeakable crimes.  Soon, many of the town's postal workers and other once-upstanding citizens will fall under the spell of \\"The Messenger\\" and help him paint the town crimson red...<br /><br />Ed Lee's Leisure efforts are always a bit tamer in the mayhem department than his other works but \\"The Messenger\\" definitely has its share of gruesome scenes.  Most of the murders in this book do not occur individually but rather on larger scales with several massacres of 20+ people.  As expected, Lee spares no details when describing these scenes.<br /><br />This novel is a page-turner that reads easily and the pages flow smoothly.  It's just not necessarily a great page turner.  I had so many problems with this book I don't even know where to start. \\"The Messenger\\" never actually makes a physical appearance, he is just an invisible presence that can enter the minds of others.  In my opinion this absence of a central villain kind of hurt the story and robbed it of an exciting ending.  Also, the motive of The Messenger is unclear, aside from \\"wanting to deliver a message\\".  What is he gaining by slaughtering all these innocent people?  Why in Dannelton?  After the first two massacres, why isn't anyone considering high-tailing it out of town?  How come nobody (except the police chief) remembers the initial massacre 20 years ago?  The list of inconsistencies goes on.<br /><br />Character development was extremely thin and the lack of supporting characters was bothersome.  The way this story is presented you'd think Dannelton only had a population of about 50 people or so.  Still, as an Edward Lee fan I couldn't help but enjoying the novel anyway and I'm sure the bulk of his loyal fans will too because it is graphic and it is gruesome.  It just doesn't make much sense nor is it memorable.  I know that Lee can do much better than this.  \\"City Infernal\\" is a book that comes to mind in the sense I'll never forget it and it had a truly original concept that made it stand out from the rest of the mass-market horror pile.  Sadly, this is not the case with The Messenger.this story is presented you'd think Dannelton only had a population of about 50 people or so.

Books 1,2&3 were all amazing and then things started tailing off.  Books 4 and 5 were somewhat pedestrian and unnecessarily long entries that proved that with King's dark tower series bigger is NOT better.  Book#6, Song of Susannah is a step above the last two but still not as good as the first three.  At least it does away with the flashbacks, backstories and bouts of \\"Todash\\" to instead focus again on the task at hand, getting closer to the tower.<br /><br />Susannah (possessed by the spirit of Mia) has escaped from the village of Calla-Bryn Sturgis and fled to alternate world New York City.  Jake and Father Callahan are the two enlisted to run after her and bring her back safely.  Meanwhile, Eddie and Roland dive into the Maine of 1977 in hopes of buying and securing a precious piece of land (on which lies a rose that symbolizes the Dark Tower) from Calvin Tower.  They will also pay visit to a young writer named Stephen King whose latest novel \\"Salem's Lot\\" contains fictionalized accounts of Father Callahan's life as well as many links to the Dark Tower.<br /><br />In this entry, Susannah takes center stage.  Roughly 2/3 of the novel focus directly on her.  She is a person of not two but now three personalities, stumbling around a 1999 NYC that is completely alien to her, having last seen New York in the sixties.  Her inner verbal exchanges with the personality \\"Mia\\" are very intriguing to say the least although I'm growing a little impatient with the lack of explanation as to what Mia's baby has to do with the story.  Will we only know until the very end?  A great development here is that Roland is becoming more and more likeable as a character.  I couldn't help but feel a certain detachment to him early on in the series, as he was presented as an enigmatic boogeyman whose simple-minded obsession with the Tower was his only focus.  Now, because of the tight bond he has with his \\"ka-tet\\" he is becoming increasingly humane.<br /><br />The \\"gimmick\\" of a Stephen King character works surprisingly well here.  Since King has always included myriad pop culture references in his works then it makes sense that he include himself.  The chapter where Roland visits him at his Maine home is the most entertaining of the entire novel.  The dialogue exchanges between the two are priceless and it's quite a hoot to read about an author physically describing himself in self-deprecating ways.<br /><br />A good entry, but still makes me wish King would advance the group closer to the Tower.  When all is said and done, this entry was mostly about Susannah breaking away from the group and then the rest of them trying to relocate her so they can continue their journey.  Isn't it about time this series started taking major leaps forward?  It hasn't happened since \\"The Waste Lands\\".  Here's hoping book#7 will be a fast-paced swashbuckling adventure novel in the mold of \\"The Gunslinger\\" and \\"The Waste Lands\\".

Many of his books are extremely hard to find, and fans are willing to pay an arm and a leg on ebay to buy books of his that sometimes don't even exceed 100 pages.  Why is Lee so popular?  Because his stories are gruesome, gory, graphic and everything else that fans of the extreme horror genre crave.  Oh, and he's a good writer too.  Only recently have some of his titles been published in mass market editions thanks to the Leisure line of horror paperbacks.  Succubi is not one of them, it's a 1992 novel novel that has wallowed in obscurity, even among his rabid fans.  There's a good reason for that.<br /><br />Ann Slavik is a big-shot lawyer in Washington D.C.  She lives with her rebellious teenage daughter Melanie and with her writer boyfriend Martin.  When Ann gets a call that her father is not well and on his deathbed, the three head north into the boonie town of Lockwood where her parents live.  Meanwhile an escaped mental institute patient named Erik Tharp is also headed to Lockwood but for a different reason, to put an end to the sadistic cult that has been killing babies and framed Erik for it.  Anne Slavik had no idea her home town is breeding ground for a sex-mad, cannibalistic, murderous cult but she will find out soon enough...<br /><br />Succubi started off promisingly, as we meet several well-developped characters.  Lee's writing in this novel is simple but effective and displays a sharp literary wit as I found myself cracking up at several of the verbal exchanges between the characters.  Lee does take quite a while to kick his story into second gear, not good considering the short length of this novel.  Does that mean the ending is explosive then? Ehh...not quite.  I actually preferred the set-up of the first 100 pages than the last 100.  That's not usually a good thing.  The idea of a cult that sexually violates its victims and kills them while climaxing could have made for an incredibly gruesome ride but the gore is rather restrained here (only by Lee's standards mind you).  No, what's really sickening are the scenes involving Duke Belloxi, another escaped patient at the mental institution.  That dude is MEAN.  He's a walking, joke-cracking timebomb that kills absolutely anyone in his path whether he feels they deserve it or not.  His \\"exploits\\" had me squirming in my seat.<br /><br />One of the things that really bothered me about this novel was the omnipresence of a strange language that the cult members use.  These words mean absolutely nothing to the reader as we are not given any prior explanation as to their meaning.  Only at the end during a discussion between a doctor and a researcher do we get to uncover the meaning of the language but still it feels clumsy and definitely too late.  That, along with several loose ends that are never tied together and some of the main characters being dispatched unspectacularly are reasons not to shell out major bucks on this one.  But that's okay, it's one of Lee's early novels and he was still refining his style.  These days the man writes excellent books.ncredibly gruesome ride but the gore is rather restrained here (only by Lee's standards mind you).

An evil force has swept over town, one that sucks the blood out of animals and humans.  Coroner Brad Woods has performed many autopsies in the past but he has never seen bodies like this before, where every drop of blood is drained and only rippled shards of skin remain.  Nobody, including police authorities, really has a clue as to what is going on, except that is for the Wing family.  Grandmother Wing has met such a creature in the past in her native China, it's a vampire or a \\"Cup-hu-girngsi\\" as told in Cantonese.  Grandmother Wing knows that this vampire cannot be fought with the usual catholic folklore but instead with ancient Chinese secrets but will any of the town's residents believe her and listen to her before it's too late?<br /><br />Like many of Little's other novels, the setting is in a quaint peaceful community where nothing much happens but now slowly, slowly, things turn strange.  It has become a staple of his work to start things off with the mundane and then build up the intensity however this time Little takes way too long to get started.  The characters are well developed and that's all fine and dandy except what we get the rest of the way is an entire novel about people speculating whether or not vampires really could exist or not.  Yawn.  The vampire is an \\"invisible\\" one, we're never described its appearance throughout the novel, only towards the very end and even then his appearance feels lacklustre and clich&eacute;d.  The vampire mythology and Chinese culture aspects of the book could have been discussed in much further detail in my opinion (where's Stephen King when you need him?).<br /><br />Many characters are introduced only to be picked off immediately by this invisible presence.  It would have been better if Little had chosen to focus more on the characters that really work, especially Sue Wing.  Sue is a 21-year old Chinese-American lady who is absolutely one of the finest character creations of Little's career.  She is a caring, giving soul who is ostricized all over town because she's \\"different\\" but she's headstrong enough not to let any of this bother her.  The chapters with her in them were always the best ones and I just wish that Little had made her a character in one of his better novels instead.  Aside form Sue Wing, my other favourite character was Pastor Dan Wheeler.  Imagine if you will a mean version of Father Elias in \\"The Revelation\\" and you will get a good idea.  He is truly insane, and his ideologies downright frightening. I had no idea this book would be filled with so much religious themes, more than any of his other books.

Aside form Sue Wing, my other favourite character was Pastor Dan Wheeler.  Imagine if you will a mean version of Father Elias in \\"The Revelation\\" and you will get a good idea.

It is the summer break from school and Coraline is bored.  To pass the time she likes to explore the big house and its surroundings.  One afternoon, she finds a door that leads into a black corridor.  This black corridor in turn leads into a house that is practically a mirror image of her own, with the same rooms and the same inhabitants, including her parents.  But within these there are fundamental changes; the rooms contain weird variations of her toys, the house and the yard are filled with talking animals and her parents are very different here too.  They look like her parents but certainly don't act like her parents.  Soon, Coraline and her real parents are trapped into this mirror version of their house and it is up to her to get them out safely...<br />This is a challenging book to categorize.  It is actually marketed as a book for children and adults 8 years and up.  The writing is indeed geared towards a younger age bracket, the prose simplistic, the sentences short-clipped.  Not only is the novel only 160 pages long, but it's large print as well.  I personally breezed through this book in less than 2 hours.  However, one has to wonder whether this book might be a little too dark for young kids to enjoy.  Gaiman raises some deep chills here and goes for the grotesque on occasion with several scenes involving insects.  Usually I find the term \\"Dark Fantasy\\" to be a cop-out used by authors who would rather not be referred to as horror writers so as not to be pigeonholed into a genre that has its ups and downs (Dean Koontz anyone?) but with Gaiman the term actually seems to fit like a glove.  There's something very magical about his writing that makes us feel a part of the world he is crafting despite the fantastical premise.<br />I loved how Gaiman used the short length of his story to his advantage.  The story wastes little time getting started as Coraline actually stumbles upon the magical door at around page#25.  Lots of things happen in the novel especially once the \\"challenge\\" is set forth between Coraline and her other evil mother, the pace picks up and the pages become filled with action and adventure.  And the ending feels appropriate and satisfying too.  The only thing I wish would have been included is some explanation, no matter how small, of how this alternate dimension came to be.  But then again part of the appeal of Gaiman's work has always been about the mystique and unexplained weirdness of his tales.  \\"Coraline\\" is a treasure of a story, wrapped in a small package that won't require more than two hours of a reader's time and yet will leave a lasting impression.ed as Coraline actually stumbles upon the magical door at around page#25.

US	41675158	R2127KSIOQ5BYA	0843951842	600826304	Endless Night	Books	2	26	33	N	N	Invasion of the Killer Krulls	Originally published by Headline in 1993, Endless Night is one of Richard Laymon's most sadistic and mean-spirited books.  Those who have read a few of his novels would know not to take such a statement lightly.  Sadly, Endless Night also happens to be one of Laymon's worst novels, a flash-in-the-pan exercise in brainless violence that I would soon rather forget.  Richard Laymon novels are like the literary equivalent of b-movie slashers.  Fun, but not sophisticated in the least bit.  I personally gobble all of his stuff up and usually love it but not this time.<br />The story centers around a group of fiends who call themselves \\"The Krulls\\" (a self-reference to the cannibals in \\"The woods are dark\\").  Put simply, the Krulls like to break into peoples' homes at night, rape and kill the inhabitants and then torch the house so as to destroy the evidence.  Their track record was flawless until they decided to invade the Clark house, where 12-year-old Andy and 16-year-old Jody manage to escape.  It is imperative for the Krulls that these two witnesses to the crimes be dispatched immediately and Simon Quirt (who recounts all of his exploits on a tape recorder) feels more than up to the task as he would absolutely love to get his hands on Jody...<br />The book starts off with a bang and 75 pages of pure adrenaline as Jody and Andy try to flee the murderous Krulls.  This chase scene is highly enjoyable and proves that Laymon can be one of the best in the biz at creating suspense.  Then the novel takes a nosedive.  The dialogue and verbal exchanges between Jody and Andy are boring, laughable and do nothing to develop the story.  The gimmick about Simon Quirt recounting his horrible exploits on a tape could have worked but too often we end up reading about the same things twice, previously from Jody's perspective and then from his own.  Who wants to read about the exact same events twice?<br />The major problem with Endless Night was that this time Laymon decided to focus the entire story on rape, violence and perversion instead of using those things in liberal doses to supplement a central concept.  The finale was unbelievably gore-soaked and suspenseful but was still not enough to save this novel.  Oh well, Richard's written over 35 novels so I guess there's bound to be a few rotten apples.the entire story on rape, violence and perversion instead of using those things in liberal doses to supplement a central concept.

US	41675158	R3TVG2W6JJKCDB	1880418568	446733041	Wolves of the Calla (Dark Tower)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Father Callahan and ka-tet to the resue	In this fifth instalment of the dark tower series Roland and his ka-tet continue to travel through the ruins of Mid-World and along the path of the beam that leads to the dark tower.  This path leads them to Calla Bryn Sturgis, a quaint peaceful village of a couple of hundred inhabitants.  Tragedy befalls the Calla every 20 years as \\"The Wolves\\" come to take the children of the Calla away from the village for experimental purposes.  The Wolves are coming in 30 days, and the town folk enlist the help of Roland and his friends to try to protect their children from them.  This assignment is of course a detour from the quest to the dark tower, but Roland comes to conclude that it is also their \\"Ka\\" and what is their \\"Ka\\" must not be ignored.<br />Clearly \\"Wolves of the Calla\\" has its ups and downs but I feel like this is a very solid instalment in the series.  I enjoyed this one much more than book 4 the main reason being that at least we spend the entire novel with the ka-tet that we all know and love instead of characters from Roland's past who have little bearing on the Dark Tower.  The characterization is absolutely top-notch in this one starting with Roland who ceases to be this enigmatic boogeyman anti-hero and becomes someone we as readers truly gain respect for.  His actions are selfless, his philosophies enlightening and never has he come across as being more human than here, instead of just someone who robotically pursues the dark tower.  Susannah's schizophrenia is developed more fully with a fourth personality emerging.  And also not to mention the numerous tales told, the best of which being father Callahan's tale, who was the priest from Salem's Lot.  King usually frustrates me when he backtracks extensively into the past, but Callahan's tale was absolutely fascinating.<br />Again, I'm sure many readers were probably frustrated with the lack of advancement towards the tower.  Well, although the ka-tet never get physically closer to the tower since they always stay in the village this is the book in the series that opens up all the doors to their final discoveries.  If it wasn't for their stop in the village, they never would have met Father Callahan and gotten \\"Black 13\\" from him, which is able to open a doorway into the New York of 1977.<br />This novel is setting things up for a truly grandiose ending.  It never ceases to amaze me how well King is able to tie in so many elements of his literary universe together, successfully using concepts from books like The Stand and Salem's Lot which he both wrote more than 25 years ago.  He even manages to use his own name as a tie-in to the series and apparently he becomes a major character in the 6th novel.  On the surface this seems rather gimmicky but I don't doubt for a second whether he'll be able to pull it off.y always stay in the village this is the book in the series that opens up all the doors to their final discoveries.

The storm at the end of volume 2 has destroyed the Goshima home as well as most other homes in the town of  Kurozucho.  Kiri and her family are forced to move into a decrepit old row house.  Strangely, these ancient row houses are the only houses that have stood the test of time against the storm.  But all is not well in these row houses, as the inhabitants become infected with a strange disease that causes their skin to grow spirally warts all over.<br />Unlike Volume 2 where the chapters veered off in all sorts of wild directions, this volume is one continuous story from beginning to end.  From the opening chapter, it becomes clear that the town of Kurozucho is no more, and all that's left are survivors of the storm, frantically looking for food, shelter and a way out of town.  Except there's no way out of town.  The spiral has created a sort of vortex that never ends and anyone that tries to leave town finds themselves just running around in circles.  Things have really hit the fan in this volume.<br />The entire volume has the feel of post-apocalyptic horror which was awesome to me being a huge fan of that genre.  The devastating effects of the storm are on full display as the town of Kurozucho becomes one vast waste land of rubble.  This third volume is filled with despair, depression and loss of hope.  Except for Kiri of course, she just keeps chugging along, refusing to accept this madness as her fate and trying to find a way out of town for her and her friends.<br />Creator Junji Ito definitely saved his best for last.  This volume ranks right up there with the first one, maybe even better.  His theme was an end of the world scenario and he accomplished it brilliantly.  The only thing that left me a little disappointed at the end was that things sort of felt unfinished, it was a very depressing ending that left many stones unturned.  However if Ito did that purposely to pave the way for a fourth volume than all the better.  For one, I long for more explanations as to the origin of the spiral, which is never explained in any of the 3 volumes.  Prologue please!!  Even if that never happens, I'll always cherish these 3 volumes.if Ito did that purposely to pave the way for a fourth volume than all the better.

US	41675158	R1P2VJQ3QZTFVY	1569317143	254899099	Uzumaki, Volume 1	Books	5	0	0	N	N	The ultimate experience in twisted surrealism	Uzumaki comes from the mind of Junji Ito, widely considered today's best Manga horror artist.  Ito first burst onto the manga scene in the early 90's with the popularity of his \\"Tomie\\" series, about an immortal, regenerating girl whose beauty drives men insane.  There have been a bunch of Tomie movies, as well as a Hong Kong adaptation of Uzumaki, widely considered Ito's ultimate creation.  To date, 3 volumes of Uzumaki have been published.  The first volume is a remarkable feast for the imagination.<br />Kurozucho is the once-peaceful coastal town where Kiri lives.  Kiri and her boyfriend Shuichi have noticed lots of strange things in their town recently, having to do with spirals.  Shuichi's dad is dangerously obsessed with spirals of all shapes and sizes.  This obsession ultimately leads to his death, as his own body becomes twisted into a spiral form, crushing his bones.  At his funeral, the smoke from the crematorium releases his ashes into the sky in the form of a twirling spiral that dumps into the sea.  Soon the whole town becomes infested with swirling spiral shapes.<br />Any plot or summary of Uzumaki will simply not do it justice.  The concept as a whole seems simplistic and foolhardy and that's exactly what makes it so genial, that Ito can take such a simple offbeat premise and carry it to unimaginable depths of horror.  Twirling hair becomes terrifying, as does a bowl of spaghetti, anything in the shape of a spiral.  Uzumaki also explores depravity and people who go absolutely insane whenever they see a spirally shape.  One woman, for example goes to ever-increasingly horrifying measures because of her fear of spirals.  First, she shaves the hair off her head.  Then, in a gruesome scene she cuts off the skin of her fingertips and on and on until total self-mutilation becomes the cause of her death.<br />This first volume contains 6 chapters, totalling about 200 pages.  The chapters are all interconnected with the same similar premise and also with the presence of Kiri and Shuichi, who are both in every chapter.  Each chapter however is distinguished by its own little storyline, a sort of twilight zone-ish ode to the bizarre central premise.  It reads pretty fast, in about 45 minutes unless of course you choose to carefully absorb Ito's illustrations as I did.  Stunning in its imagery, clever in its telling of a story, Uzumaki may well be what what gets me back into reading comics, after years of novel reading.  Essential for any fan of horror or the weird in general.e presence of Kiri and Shuichi, who are both in every chapter.

This second volume it must be said does have a very different tone than its predecessor.  Ito has often said that one of his biggest influences was H.P. Lovecraft and in the first volume Lovecraft's influence could definitely be felt, with creatures rising from the sea, bodies twisting into horrible shapes and people losing their minds as the horrors around them unfold.  Strangely, the second volume seems to veer in a completely different direction, giving us tales that are not really connected to each other the only constant being the omnipresence of characters Kiri and Shuichi.<br />The first two chapters I felt a little disappointed by.  They just didn't seem to fit in.  Things really pick up though in the third chapter entitled \\"The black lighthouse\\" one of the best of the series.  This chapter is creepy as all get out and feels like classic gothic horror, almost like a hammer horror film.<br />Chapters 4 and 5 are directly connected to each other and take place in Kurozo hospital, where pregnant women with hand-drills try to suck the blood out of their fellow patients (including Kiri).  It's a gory and horrifying zombie tale.  In chapter 5, the babies of these pregnant women spring to life and needless to say they are not like any babies we have ever seen.  These two excellent chapters reminded me of the body horror of David Cronenberg and had me gasping in disbelief at the sheer gruesomeness of the images.<br />I loved this volume although it is clearly the lesser of the three.  Out of the 6 chapters, 3 are somewhat lacklustre although the 3 good ones more than make up for that.  My main issue here was the loss of continuity.  The first volume gave the feeling that with each chapter the town was slowly disintegrating into depravity.  The chapters in this volume feel very separated and don't flow quite as nicely.  Also, the concept of the spiral was somewhat abandoned here, it was like a background to the whole thing.  Kiri I felt kind of lost some of her cuteness and charm, some of it has to do with her cutting off her hair but also in the way she acts, she's like an adult now.  But that's all right because although volume 2 is not as atmospheric and stylish as the first, it is much more gory and gruesome and that definitely counts for something.re, it was like a background to the whole thing.

His long-awaited debut novel, \\"The Rising\\" is a fast-paced, gory and wildly adventurous romp that never slows down.  It's no wonder this won a Bram Stoker award for best first novel and that Keene is quickly developing a rabid cult following among horror fans.<br />Zombies have completely invaded America.  There are however a few remaining survivors such as Jim, the hero of the story.  A divorced construction worker who lost custody of his son a year ago, Jim lives a life of recluse in the bomb shelter below his West Virginia home.  As far as he is concerned, there is no reason for him to leave the safety of the shelter to face the outside world overridden with zombies.  That is, until his son calls his cellphone letting him know he's still alive and in need of rescue.  Jim then sets upon a road mission from West Virginia to New Jersey where his son lives.  Along the way he will meet several interesting characters such as a preacher, an ex-prostitute, a guilt-ridden scientist and of course armies of the undead.<br />From the very first page on, this novel is one roller-coaster ride of action and violence that left me breathless and gasping for air.  There is no wasted time, no overwrought material, just slam-bam action from the get-go all the way through to the end.  The only downside to this is that the characters appear a little bit thin due to lack of development but that's the style that Keene intentionally decided to go with and it works in his favour.  This novel reads like a zombie b-movie gone berserk, reminiscent of the wild recklessness of Romero's Dawn of the Dead.  It even manages to tread new ground as far as zombie fiction goes, these are the intelligent zombies that can drive cars and shoot guns.  Most interesting is Keene's use of animals as undead creatures.  One scene containing a flock of undead birds would make ol' Hitchcock very proud.<br />Throughout the novel, Keene displays an outstanding grasp of modern street lingo and culture, prompting some critics to refer to his work as \\"gangsta\\" horror.  Anyone offended by large amounts of swearing would be best served to stay away from this novel. Admittedly, this novel has a few problems at its core.  The explanations behind the plague didn't make much sense to me, even the scientist appeared clueless most of the time.  Also, Frankie's sudden transformation from weak addicted junkie to veritable female Rambo literally happens overnight and is a pill I found tough to swallow.<br />But the upsides of this novel far outweigh the negatives and despite the minor problems (not to mention numerous spelling and editing mistakes) I don't believe anybody could ever accuse this novel of being boring.  Shlocky? Yes.  Dumb? Perhaps.  Boring?  Not a chance.  Clearly, Brian Keene is a reader's writer.  He has no doubt read tons of horror fiction himself and seems to know exactly what most fans want: no strings attached escapism and entertainment.birds would make ol' Hitchcock very proud.  <br />Throughout the novel, Keene displays an outstanding grasp of modern street lingo and culture, prompting some critics to refer to his work as \\"gangsta\\" horror.

US	41675158	R7AAYY18Q2T10	0670032573	511631376	Wizard and Glass (The Dark Tower, Book 4)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Roland and friends go on a coffee break	Earlier this year, upon hearing that Stephen King had completed the Dark Tower series and that the last 2 books were to be published in 2004, I chose to finally crack up this series. I was immediately enchanted by the truly grandiose landscape that King was painting and thought the first 3 books were excellent, especially #3 The Waste Lands.  It is in this third novel that the path to the dark tower finally became clear and oh so much happened in that book to advance the story.  The fourth novel Wizard and Glass, although a fine literary achievement, does practically nothing to advance the series.<br />The story of Wizard and Glass picks up immediately where the third book left off, with Roland and his companions trapped aboard Blaine the monorail, a suicidal train running at a speed of about 800 miles an hour.  Blaine, who adores riddles, cuts a deal with the group whereby they must ask him a bunch of riddles and if they happen to stump him on one he'll let them off the train safely. Once safe and sound, the group sit around a campfire and it is here that Roland will tell them the tale he had promised to tell.  It is a tale of Roland at the age of fourteen and two of his friends, Cuthbert and Alain, who leave the land of Gilead after being sent west on a mission by Roland's father. They settle into the county of Hambry, where Roland will fall in love with a woman named Susan, and make enemies with almost everyone in town.<br />I was aware before diving into Wizard and Glass that the majority of the novel was set in Roland's past and welcomed the idea with open arms, wanting to learn more about Roland.  The book focused on the wrong things however.  I was hoping for things like character development on Roland's parents and on his mother's affair with the wizard Marten that devastated family dynamics.  Or of Roland's training as a young gunslinger at the hands of Cort.  Cort appears to be such a fascinating character and this would have seemed to be the best opportunity for King to develop him but alas he barely gets a mention.  Or how about digging into the roots of Roland's obsession with reaching the dark tower?  Nope, not in this book.  The 500 pages focus pretty much on events that bear little to do on the quest to the dark tower.  Roland falls in love. Great. Him and his companions battle forces of evil in a small town. Great.<br />To be fair, King does weave an enchanting tale that is fun to read, therefore that's why I still gave this book a high rating despite my frustrations.  The town of Hambry is vividly captured, the setting feels magical, the characters really burst to life.  The love story between Roland and Susan is heartfelt.  I also found Rhea, the witch who lives on top of a cliff, to be an amazing character. Every scene with her was great, and lent some much-needed gloom to a story that otherwise would have had all the gloom of a harlequin romance novel.  One problem that bordered me immensely:  Roland is narrating the tale to his friends around a campfire.  So how does he know all corners of the story?  Such as all the things that happened between closed doors in Rhea's lair, or in Susan's home, at the Sherrif's office, all events where he was not present.  Around the campfire, Eddie Dean asks him precisely this question, to which Roland replies:\\"I don't think that's what you really want to know Eddie\\".  A one sentence cop-out for something that just doesn't make any sense.  Or maybe Roland knows all these things because he saw them through the crystal ball?  It's not explained and I've given up trying to make sense of it.<br />My final analysis of Wizard and Glass is that although still good, so far this is the weakest entry in the series especially after the absolute high that was \\"The Waste Lands\\".  Wizard and Glass reads well as a singular tale, but for those looking for advancement towards the dark tower I would actually go so far as to recommend reading only the first 112 pages and the last 60 and skipping everything in the middle. It would be a much better use of time.pping everything in the middle. It would be a much better use of time.	2004-06-05

Roland, Eddie and Susannah have moved away from the beaches of the western sea and into the great forest about 60 miles north.  As they cross the forest, the three are etching further along one of the 6 beams leading to the dark tower.  Roland continues to be plagued by nightmares and voices about Jake, the young kid he was separated from at the conclusion of the first volume.  Jake is alive and well but he is nowhere to be found in Roland's world as he is instead back in his world, the NYC of present time.  He too, is plagued by nightmares and voices about his lost companion and he is desperately searching for the door that will lead him out of his world and back into Roland's...<br />Whereas the second volume was drawing the group and setting things up, it is in this third volume of the series where the \\"ka-tet\\" is making leaps and bounds and etching ever closer to the tower.  Eddie and Susannah are no longer reluctant and pessimistic about the strange world they were thrown into, they now accept this adventure as being their fate and Roland as their friend.  They are now fully trained gunslingers and ready to face the perils that lie ahead.<br />The New York chapters in this entry are even better than the last one, as we follow Jake desperately trying to find a way back in into Roland's world.  It was kind of neat how Roland and Jake were both simultaneously going insane while apart from each other.  Once Jake finally manages to make it back into Roland's world and join his travelling companions to the tower is once the pace accelerates in dramatic fashion.  Over several days, the Ka-Tet travel through the great forest, across the desert, stop into strange towns, cross a perilous bridge, pick up a new travelling companion and much, much more.  The Waste Lands is high adventure unlike anything witnessed in the previous two entries of the series.<br />Again, King leaves the reader with a bunch of head-scratching thoughts throughout.  Most intriguing to me is trying to make sense of wether some of the characters in Roland's world are parallel versions of King characters in others of his novels.  Is Walter, aka the wizard magician aka the man in black, in effect Randall Flagg?  Is the tick-tock man the trash can man in the Stand?

Every 6 months, Leisure Horror publishes a \\"new\\" Richard Laymon title.  \\"New\\" only in the sense that the novel was previously unpublished in the U.S.  Most of Laymon's works were left unpublished in his native country, instead only available through a British publisher by the name of Headline Feature that distributed his books mostly in the U.K., Australia and Canada.  Body Rides, which first surfaced under Headline in 1996, is reputed among many hardcore Laymon fans to be one of his best titles.  As someone who has now read upwards of 20 Laymon books my concensus is this: Body Rides is solid and well worth a read but at the same time nowhere close to being a Laymon top-five.<br />While returning a couple of video rentals late at night, Neal Darden hears a faraway scream coming from a wooded area on the side of the highway.  He pulls over his car, grabs his unregistered Sig Sauer .380 pistol and heads over to the rescue.  He finds a naked young female tied to a tree while a man is physically abusing her.  Neal ends up shooting the man and rescuing the woman.  The woman, named Elise, thanks Neal with her life and hands to him as a reward a gold magic bracelet.  The bracelet enables someone to take \\"Body Rides\\", which means your spirit leaves your own body and enters the body of another unsuspecting person.  The bracelet will prove invaluable to Neal, as the rapist he shot has vengeance on his mind.  With the aid of the bracelet, Neal can step into the minds of others, including his would-be killer...<br />In typical Laymon style, the novel starts off with a bang, with a series of intense scenes of rape, revenge and murder.  After the first maybe hundred pages or so however things slow down drastically.  Neal, wanting to flee the dangers he now faces in L.A., goes on a sort of joyride through the California and Nevada deserts, where he will find love and a temporary inner peace of mind.  This joyride through the desert, which is a major portion of the book, is entertaining in its on way but sort of feels separate from the novel he started.  It doesn't really do much as far as progressing the story and although I enjoyed it I couldn't help but wonder where Laymon was trying to go with all this.  I guess the major bone I had with this Laymon was the absence of danger Neal faced throughout the book.  The villain Laymon created is very menacing, a sort of skinny, shaggy-haired, greasy Charles Manson lookalike but his appearances throughout the novel were far and few, which I found took away from the novel's intensity.<br />A thumbs up must be given to Laymon for creating truly great characters in this one however.  Neal is quite likeable and most of his actions somewhat believable under the circumstances.  Then there are the two women he loves, Marta, and a hillbilly girl named Sue.  Reading about their love triangle was a blast, although I had a bit of trouble believing that two women who barely knew each other would be totally cool about sharing the same guy.  If a lot of guys are lucky enough to have this happen to them in real life than I guess I've been missing out on something good. The novel's central premise of taking \\"Body Rides\\" was certainly very entertaining, it made for a lot of embarrassingly humouress situations, to which Laymon exploited its full use.  Overall this was certainly a good Laymon but not one of his very best.

It was a fascinating tale set in England's rural countryside where all adults turned into zombified creatures seeking to kill all young people under the age of eighteen including their own children.  Especially their own children.  With \\"Stranger\\" Clark once again revisits the post-apocalyptic field, this time set in America, and does so with brilliant results.<br />A bizarre plague has swept South America.  Nobody knows exactly how the plague started, some people believe it had to do with the air or a bug in the water system.  As more people started dying, many of the South American populace started to flee north into Mexico, and finally into the USA.  As the infected populace became more and more desperate and dangerous entire cities were destroyed and overturned.  The infected South Americans, nicknamed \\"bread bandits\\" by the American populace, soon developed an insatiable appetite for killing and for devouring human flesh.  It wasn't long before \\"bread bandits' stopped being a term for the South Americans, as the American populace also became inflected with this strange virus.<br />Not everyone became infected however.  The infection rate is approximately 90%, leaving a number of survivors.  Introducing the town of Sullivan.  This island town of approximately 5000 has barricaded itself from the rest of civilisation and has become entirely self-sufficient and infection free.  Nobody is allowed in or out of Sullivan.  Compared to the rest of the country Sullivan is a peaceful oasis.  However Greg Valdiva(narrator of this tale) is starting to see things in a different light.  The residents and city counsel are acting increasingly paranoid and desperate whenever the slightest thing goes wrong or whenever one of the town's many rules is bent.  As Valdiva decides to set sail and explore the world outside of Sullivan he discovers much more than he bargained for.<br />Like many end of the world novels Stranger has a grim tone but there is always an underlying recurrent theme of hope throughout.  The narrating title character Greg Valdiva is someone with a very unique personality.  I like how Clark painted him not as a heroic saint but as a flawed hero, who in his own way is capable of monstrous action when pushed to the brink.  The first 150 pages or so are set in the town of Sullivan and are fascinating but things get even better after that once the events take place throughout the rest of the country.  It becomes a sort of desparate roadtrip through a desolate landscape as Greg Valdiva and friends pillage through deserted town after deserted town in hope that they will finally find peace and salvation from the ever-looming menace of the zombefied population.<br />This is really a great end of the world horror novel.  Clark's prose is simple and engaging making this fast, compulsive reading on a par with Blood Crazy.  The only drawback I found was that Stranger is missing a lot of the scientific explanations and reasonings behind the nature of the plague that made Blood Crazy such a fascinating read.  However anyone looking for fast-paced gory zombie action will not be disappointed.  Comparisons between this novel and the movie Day of the Dead would not be unwarranted.  Stranger is a story of hope, survival, desperation and claustrophobia as the zombies multiply in numbers and the number of uninfected continually decrease every day.  I will definitely read more of Simon Clark in the future for everything I've read from him so far has been gold.of Sullivan he discovers much more than he bargained for. <br />Like many end of the world novels Stranger has a grim tone but there is always an underlying recurrent theme of hope throughout.

US	41675158	R3UMTEYOZCYFK9	0843952032	656018471	Infernal Angel	Books	3	3	4	N	N	The disappointing sequel to City Infernal	It was with great anticipation that I awaited this sequel's release.  City Infernal, although not great prose, was a fantastic read with a highly inventive concept.  Apparently Lee is planning to make this a trilogy.  Let's just hope the third instalment ends up being better than this one.<br />Almost the entire first half of the novel takes place on earth.  Cassie is now trapped in a psych ward.  Her house was burned down along with her father in it and authorities believe that she's the one who committed this act of arson so that she could inherit her father's wealth.  No one believes Cassie's story that it was Lucifer and his demons so that they could destroy the deadpass in her house that allows her to channel herself to hell's city, the Mephistopolis.  While in the ward, Cassie receives visits from an angel by the name of Angelese who helps Cassie get back into hell so that she may use her etheress powers to overturn Lucifer's forces and also so Cassie can be reunited with her dead sister.<br />The above plot summary was a very abbreviated version of the initial events.  Really, the action doesn't veer towards the Mephistopolis until at least halfway through the point of this 340 page novel.  It's a VERY slow start in which several new characters are introduced, most notably Walter who is an Etherean, the male version of an Etheress.  Admittedly, Lee draws this character extremely well.  Walter is a hopeless geek with no social acumen whatsoever and Lee does a masterful job of making us feel his inner pain.  It's too bad Lee was never as successful drawing out Cassie's character, who still to this point seems as empty psychologically and personality wise as a hollow shell.  It's almost as though Cassie is presented in a distant 3rd person narrative and we as readers are unable to feel anything for her.<br />Once the novel finally starts taking place in the Mephistopolis, again it takes forever for anything to happen.  The pace and the action does pick up after a while but it seems a little too late. Similar to City Infernal, descriptions of the Mephistopolis and its sights abound.  The problem is, we've already been described in extensive detail in the first novel the atrocities of the Mephistopolis so why go into mind-numbing detail again?  It's not that the same things are described, there are new sites described but it all seems rather arbitrary.  It feels as though Lee is just making all these things up on the spot.  The gore level is quite low in this novel which will surely disappoint regular readers of Lee's novels.  I understand that in no way is this series meant to be as graphic as the author's other works but there's less gore in this novel than even City Infernal.<br />It saddens me to give this a mediocre star rating since I'm a big fan of Lee's work.  Infernal Angel is not a total washout, it is quite entertaining, it just didn't move me the way the first novel did.  In a way, this entire novel feels like a setup for much more grandiose things to happen in the series' 3rd entry.  Infernal Angel does finish with a bang so I'll still be eagerly awaiting the final novel of this trilogy.ter a while but it seems a little too late.

US	41675158	R2LMOCAA0VXDI4	0670032557	511631376	The Drawing of the Three (The Dark Tower, Book 2)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Roland draws his &quot;ka-tet&quot;	The Drawing of the Three continues the adventure of Roland's quest to reach the dark tower.  At the end of the previous volume, Roland learned his future through a deck of tarot cards.  Three cards, one showing a man called \\"The Prisoner\\", another a woman called \\"The Lady of Shadows\\", and one a mysterious shape simply entitled \\"Death\\" were revealed as prophecies that would enable Roland to continue his quest for the tower.  In order to \\"draw\\" these three (who all reside in New York City) Roland must march further along a seemingly endless beach and find 3 separate doors that are portals out of his world and into our own.<br />Unlike the Gunslinger where the reader was thrust into a variety of landscapes, the entirety of this second novel of the dark tower series takes place in only two distinct settings: The beach in Roland's world and the grimy streets of New York City in our own.  The Beach parts of the novel were my favourite, it is an atmospheric place where King does a masterful job of making the reader feel like we are there; he describes in fantastic detail the crashing of waves, the endless stretch of sand, the burning sun and packs his beach with villainous creatures named \\"lobstrosities\\", large lobsters that crawl out of the water and attempt to take a bite out of Roland and his fellow travellers.  When the action shifts to NYC, it's quite a hoot to read about the awkwardness of Roland trying to integrate himself into the fast-paced street life of the big apple.<br />The Drawing of the Three succeeds as a novel based on the strength of its characters.  In fact, the entire novel could be described as a character study.  These characters all become very likeable and despite all of them having major fundamental flaws (one's a junkie, one's a wheelchair-bound schizophrenic, another a psychopathic murderer) they prove to be essential to Roland's never-ending quest.  King really displays a sharp wit here as he packs this novel with tons of clever jokes and memorable one-liners especially through the character of \\"The Prisoner\\" a street-wise Junkie trying to kick the habit.<br />I have often heard many people mention The Drawing of the Three as being the weakest entry in the Dark Tower series. I have met even more who have decided to abandon the series after being disappointed with this novel.  I can kind of imagine some of the reasons why that may be.  The whole novel really focuses solely on the 3 characters Roland is trying to draw.  At no point in the novel do we get the feeling that Roland is getting physically closer to reaching the tower.  Really, this novel feels more like a footnote to the series whereas The Gunslinger was a novel that stood extremely well on its own.  But this novel is a great one nonetheless and obviously King already had grandiose plans as far as the length of the series when he wrote this book.  I thought this book was extremely entertaining and if The Drawing of the Three really is to be the low point of the Dark Tower series then I know I'm going to be in for quite a ride.able one-liners especially through the character of \\"The Prisoner\\" a street-wise Junkie trying to kick the habit.  <br />I have often heard many people mention The Drawing of the Three as being the weakest entry in the Dark Tower series.

Never has a single phrase been as good at describing the crux of an entire novel.  Stephen Kings first dark tower installment takes place in a desolate landscape of a world that mirrors our own.  Roland, the last Gunslinger, chases after the man in black who holds the answers to get to the dark tower, a mission Roland has been on his entire adult life.  As he travels around the vast desert hot on the tail of the man in black, Roland stumbles upon few sights along the way including the town of Tull, where he meets the sexually ravenous Alice and the god-worshipping Sylvia Pittston.  It is after leaving Tull that Roland will meet the one person who will most help him fulfill his quest; the little boy Jake. Jake becomes the Gunslingers travel companion as they chase the man in black through this desolate world of sand, mountains and a whole lot of nothing.<br />The Gunslinger is a terrific start to the series, a surreal adventure of boundaryless imagination.  I get the impression much of the series is fantasy instead of Kings trademark horror but this first installment reads more like a western than anything else.  The chapters where Roland rests in the town of Tull are the best part of the book, as King injects the town with truly bizarre and fascinating characters and a final showdon between Roland and the residents of Tull that results in a blaze of gunsmoke and firepower.  This book is packed with action from start to finish but as a reader the utmost concentration must be kept at all times since The Gunslinger does not read in linear fashion; it is a book of many flashbacks, dreams and hallucinations.  Amazingly, although the first installment of a series that contains several entries, The Gunslinger stands very well on its own as a singular tale. The ending is satisfying but of course many things are left unresolved such as two very fundamental questions; What is it that really lies within the dark tower?  Who is Roland really and why is he doing this?  After this excellent start, Im looking very much forward to reading the other entries in the series.  If the subsequent novels are anything like The Gunslinger, than Im in for an amazing journey.n the dark tower?  Who is Roland really and why is he doing this?

In \\"Death du Jour\\" Tempe investigated a series of bizarre murders by religious cults in Quebec and in the Carolinas.  In this third installment of Kathy Reichs' series, Tempe becomes immersed into the biker circuit of Montreal.  Quebec has long been a haven for biker gangs.  Outside of the California Bay Area, Quebec is the North American area with the highest number of Hells Angels chapters and in the years leading to the publication of this year-2000 novel, home to the biggest biker turf war in the world.  When several biker-related shooting deaths occur in the same week (including the accidental death of a nine-year old girl) Brennan and the Sûret&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec begin investigating and drawing leads from several biker gangs including The Rock Machine, The Heathens and The Vipers, a Hells Angels Puppet club.  In the midst of these investigations Tempe receives a surprise visit from her nephew Kit, who moves in with her temporarily.  But is Kit's visit really attributed to Auntie love and wanting to see Montreal sites?  Or is it that Kit's undying love of the Harley Davidson has made him some questionable new friends?<br />The tone set by Deadly D&eacute;cisions is quite different than that of its predecessors.  This time Reichs is less interested in providing the viewers with hands-on academic knowledge of forensic and medical procedures instead giving us a fast-paced and action-packed mystery thriller that focuses more on its characters.  The usual suspects are here; Claudel, Charbonneau and Ryan but the novel most benefits from the addition of Kit, Tempe's visiting nephew from Texas.  Kit likes to indulge in the usual 19 year old pleasures like girls, drinking, partying, rock music, sony playstation, etc. but possesses a Southern charm and gentleman manners that are most endearing.  It was also great to see Tempe for once finally place some of her trust in discussing her case with a personal acquaintance, and Kit being able to help due to his wealth of knowledge on motorcycles.  Reich's descriptions of the structure of outlaw motorcycle clubs is highly entertaining and very well researched as she explores some of the connections between the \\"big four\\", The Hells Angels, The Outlaws, The Bandidos, The Pagans, and their many sub-clubs.<br />All of Deadly D&eacute;cisions takes place in and around Montreal and as usual Reichs delivers a hands-on crash course of this French Canadian city's sites and culture for the unitiated.  A native Montrealer, I couldn't help but marvel at the accurate portrayal of the city, especially the East-Side and Rue Hochelaga which has long been a nest of biker gangs and biker bars.  However although Reichs obviously knows the city very well, it does show sometimes that she is a transplanted American and not a \\"pure laine\\" member of La Belle Province.  For one, French Canadians do not say \\"Chien Chaud\\" when ordering a hot-dog.  They might in France but not in Quebec.  Also, any Montrealer the least bit familiar with the province's huge biker circuit will be able to tell you that there are a lot more of these clubs in neighbourhoods such as NDG or Côte-des-neiges than in St-Basile-Le-Grand.  I also found it strange that Reichs failed to mention anything about Satan's Choice, who were Quebec's second largest biker gang before losing a well-publicized turf war against the Hells Angels in the later part of the 1990's.<br />I found Reich's third item in her series to make for truly fast and compulsive reading. I must admit to being quite surprised at the low reviewer rating this novel has and the opinion of many fans of this being the weakest entry in Reichs' series.  Instead of sending the reader on a wild goose chase of improbable coincidences and links like she did in \\"Death Du Jour\\" Reichs keeps it straightforward and the results arehighly entertaining.	2004-01-27

A series of murders and bizarre findings led Tempe to go undercover and explore Montreal's seedy underworld of drugs and prostitution.  In \\"Death du Jour\\", Tempe seeks to uncover the mystery behind a devastating house fire in St-Jovite that killed 4, including 2 infant babies.  It is soon discovered that the cause of the fire is arson and all signs point to a dangerous cult as being the culprit.<br />As ususal the main strength of a Reichs novel is the believability of its protagonist Tempe Brennan.  Tempe is a truly complex character of many emotions that are felt thoughout the novel's engaging first-person narrative.  The synergy between herself and detective Ryan is irresistible and reminiscent of Mulder and Scully from the X-files except this time the female is the believer and the male the pessimist.  This is a very technical and academic work of fiction with in-depth descriptions of forensic procedures, fossil descriptions and coroner reports.  In technical terms the author certainly knows what she writes about since she practices forensic anthropology herself, lending the novel a high sense of genuineness.  I found to be most fascinating the in-depth knowledge of cults that we learn throughout, both fictional and historical such as the Solar Temple cult.  I was also impressed with Reich's ability to describe the bitter cold of a Montreal winter, having lived there myself I thought she was bang on with some of her descriptions.  The climactic final pages take place during the throes of Quebec's devastating ice storm of 1998 and the descriptions are done extremely well, amid a breakneck pace.<br />As much as I enjoyed \\"Death du Jour\\" in my opinion this novel is not quite as good as D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead.  I was disappointed that the French Canadian flavour of the first novel was not as omnipresent and found that the book lost a bit of its steam once the action shifted away from Quebec and into North Carolina.  My major beef is that there were way too many wild coincidences; Tempe's sister Harry, who lives in Texas has just registered for a new course that happens to have a field work assignment in...you guessed it Montreal!  The house fire in Quebec has links to a cult in the U.S.  Where in the U.S.?  Why in the Carolinas, right by Tempe's hometown!  There were many other improbable links that felt somewhat insulting to a seasoned mystery reader like myself but did not ruin my enjoyment of the novel too much.  I found Death du Jour to be very entertaining.  It fell short of the accomplishment of her debut novel but with \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead\\" Reichs had set herself a very high pedestal to keep up with.

The late 80s and early 90s were particularly impressive as he released a trio of amazing novels such as Swan Song, Stinger and The Wolfs Hour.  Mccammon has never written a sequel to one of his novels but if you ask most of his fans they would tell you that The Wolfs Hour is the most likely to have one since the story ends before the end of the second world war therefore leaving Michael Gallatin with many other potential missions.  Of course, McCammon has been retired from publishing for upwards of ten years(Speaks the Nightbird is not a comeback novel as it was written several years ago but only published recently) so it doesnt look like there will ever be a sequel to The Wolfs Hour which is sad news for anyone who enjoyed this novel as much as I did.<br />Michael Gallatin is a transplanted Russian who's a top agent for Britain during WWII.  In 1942, he overtook Rommel in North Africa and foiled the Nazis plan to control the Suez Canal, a vital waterway that would ensure that Nazi Germany could choke off Allied shipping and continue their march east into the underbelly of Russia.  Fast forward to 1944: the war still rages on and the Nazis are being forced toward Berlin by a vengeful Soviet tide but Western Europe is still in Hitlers grip.<br />Gallatin, in seclusion since 1942, is called back for a vital mission: The first part of the mission has him being parachuted into Nazi-occupied France to retrieve vital information from an informant in Paris who is under tight security from the Gestapo.  Once the informations retrieved Gallatin must make his way east to Berlin, the poisoned heart of the Nazis lair, in an attempt to foil a top-secret Nazi invasion plan that goes by the code name of Iron Fist.  But Michael Gallatin holds a secret that no one, foes or allies, know.  He is a lycanthrope, able to change into a werewolf at will.<br />A werewolf battling Nazi Germany seems on the surface to be a ludicrous concept but McCammon spends so much time and detail on Gallatins background and upbringing as a young boy raised by a pack of wolves in Russia that the werewolf concept does become believable in the context of this fictional tale.  Aside from Gallatin being a lycanthrope there are no other major fantastical elements to the story and McCammons careful research and vivid descriptions really made me feel that I was myself fighting for my own life in the throes of World War II in a way that non-fictional accounts Ive read were never able to do as well.  Although most of the characters are fictional, there are a few real ones such as Erwin Rommel, Martin Borman and of course Hitler himself whos portrayal is effectively chilling.  Really the only complaint I have of this novel are concerning the flashback chapters about Gallatins upbringing within the pack of wolves in Russia.  I would have preferred McCammon spent a little bit less time on this.  As these flashback chapters are scattered throughout the novel, I often found myself wanting to skip them so I could return to the war story.<br />Many have made comparisons between this novel and the Indiana Jones films which I would have to agree is an apt comparison.  This is a high-octane adventure thriller of the first order with several action scenes that would certainly translate very well to the silver screen.  Nobody should let themselves be intimidated by the size of this novel as the pages fly by at a brisk pace.  Nor would a reader need in-depth historical knowledge of WWII or be a history buff to enjoy it since McCammon summarizes factual events in a clear and understandable way.  All in all I would consider this an essential read for Robert McCammon fans and Im glad I finally read it after years of passing it by.olf at will.<br />A werewolf battling Nazi Germany seems on the surface to be a ludicrous concept but McCammon spends so much time and detail on Gallatins background and upbringing as a young boy raised by a pack of wolves in Russia that the werewolf concept does become believable in the context of this fictional tale.

US	41675158	R1UQY8EUAYRRHK	0380789019	511174865	Neverwhere	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Gaiman's subterranean underworld of fun and frights	First published in 1996, Neverwhere was Neil Gaiman's first foray into adult fiction after a very successful career in comic book literature.  His \\"Sandman\\" series of serial comics is one of the most successful of all time.  Gaiman made the transition from comic book writer and illustrator to novelist with surprising ease, as Neverwhere proved to be a huge commercial and critical success.  Neverwhere is a novel that borrows elements from many different genres, in particular dark fantasy, horror and even children fantasy, most notably Alice in Wonderland.  But Neverwhere is no children's book nor is it a book for readers weened on safe and sound fantasy.  Neverwhere is a very dark novel, a dirty, grimy \\"London Below\\" of murder, torture, genuine horror and truly psychopathic villains.<br />Richard Mayhew is a former Scott who now lives and works in London.  His life is the epitomy of mundane and average.  He lives in a one-bedroom apartment in a decrepit part of the city, works an office job in a little cubicle and is engaged to a nagging high-maintenance woman who he may or may not truly love.  One night on his way to dinner with his fianc&eacute;, he stumbles upon a young girl, unconscious and bleeding on the side of the street.  Richard wants to lend a hand but the girl refuses to be brought to the hospital so he brings her to his apartment instead.  He then learns that the girl, whose name is \\"Door\\", is really from London Below, an underworld of mazes and tunnels.  The next day, Richard finds his entire world thrown upside down.  Nobody notices him anymore; not his fianc&eacute;, nor his co-workers or the office building's security guard, nobody. He can't even manage to flag down a taxi.  It turns out that by helping out Door, Richard has become invisible to London Above (the world he used to be a part of) and his existence now lies solely in London below.  Together with Door, Richard sets on a mission in London Below to find the mystical Angel Islington, who holds the answer as to who murdered Door's family and left her bleeding on the street and who can restore Richard's existence in London above.<br />Gaiman packs his world of London Below with truly fascinating characters, such as a female Rambo of a bodyguard named Hunter, an eccentric cook named Marquis de Carabas, a populace of giant rats and \\"rat-speakers\\" and most fascinatingly, a pair of hitmen by the name of Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandermar who will stop at nothing to get their hands on the little girl \\"Door\\".  Gaiman's writing is fast and fluid, a style I found truly invigorating.  There is a nary a dull moment in this book as Gaiman throws us scene after scene of danger and myriad new characters along the way.  In a way, it is very much the writing style you would expect from a former comic-book writer.  Of course the downside to this is that very little time is spent on character development, as it takes a backseat to the atmosphere that Gaiman is creating.  We don't get much of a glimpse into the minds of the characters as the action unfolds.  But still, I personally prefer a no-nonsense novel of 400 action packed pages than say, a 700 page so-called \\"epic\\" of overwrought material.<br />As fascinating as I found this book to be, I imagine it must be a reel hoot for Londoners to read, especially Londoners familiar with the city's underground transit system.  Gaiman uses real London station names and brings each station to life, such as an Earl who resides in Earl's Court Station and Friars in Blackfriars station.  On top of the fantastical elements, Gaiman also injects numerous societal commentaries into his work, especially on the ever-present class divisions of England.  Social outcasts, freaks and winos may be looked down upon in London Above but in London Below, they finally have a place where they can feel a sense of belonging.  Anyone considering reading this novel should not hesitate any further.  There seems to be no limit to Neil Gaiman's imagination, and Ifound my venture into his world of London Below to be a truly spellbinding experience I will not soon forget.my venture into his world of London Below to be a truly spellbinding experience I will not soon forget.	2003-12-30

As in the previous two installments The Return of The King is divided into two books, Book 5 and Book 6.<br />Book 5 takes place in the land of Gondor, one of the last resisting outposts to the dark forces of Sauron.  New characters are introduced such as the evil king of nazgul, Dernhelm the warrior of Rohan and most notably Denethor, the steward of Gondor and father of Boromir and Faramir who is now living in his twilight years.  The characters of Faramir and Eowyn are also expanded on in considerable detail.  In preparation of Sauron's dark forces waging a battle against Gondor, Aragorn gathers around his armies to fight back. Pippin and Gandalf ride into Gondor and Pippin becomes part of the towerguard.  Many people of Rohan also join Gondor in the fight, including Dernhelm, King Theoden and Merry, who was left behind in The Two Towers.  As the forces of Sauron approach and the great battle begins, Denethor slips into madness and becomes suicidal, wanting to pull his own son Faramir down with him.<br />It's not until halfway through the novel, in book 6, that we get to read about Sam and Frodo.  After a climactic battle in the tower of Cirith Ungol against the giant spider Shelob, Frodo is captured and now a prisoner of the Orcs.  Sam however has managed to escape with the ring.  His first instinct tells him that he must now carry on the quest to destroy the ring by himself but as loneliness and the weight of the ring bears in on him, he decides to turn around and attempt to rescue Frodo. As Sam and Frodo continue their journey and etch closer and closer to the fires of Mount Doom, they encounter several obstacles along the way, including marching armies of Orcs and the ever-looming presence of the slinking creature Gollum.<br />Book 5 and book 6 are quite different in tone and structure.  Book 5 is admitedly very wordy and talkative.  There are lots of slow passages and in-depth character development that often made me wonder whether I really was reading the conclusion to one of the greatest epics of all time.  The battle sequence is only described over 20 pages or so.  The author does not go into great detail attempting to describe it however, he places such vivid images in the head of the reader that we can easily picture in our minds what is going on.  The reward for reading through the at-times murky first half of the novel is that when we fnally get to follow the adventures of Sam and Frodo in Book 6 the action becomes non-stop and the suspense never lets up.  Tolkien is so good at describing their journey that he managed to make me feel what the charactes were feeling.  As I was reading, I actually started to feel hungry, thirsty, physically drained and increasingly sympathetic towards Sam's frustration with Gollum's antics.<br />Curiously, by the time Sam and Frodo's journey comes to an end, there is still about 100 pages to go.  These first few pages start off with reunions, gatherings and farewells.  As I was reading these first few pages, I started to worry about the the daunting prospect of having to read through 100 pages of farewells and sob stories but it turns out ol' Tolkien had a few more tricks up his sleeve.  As the hobbits return to the Shire, they discover one last major obstacle awaiting them.  These pages are easily among some of the best in the entire series.<br />Reading The Return of The King on the eve of its theatrical release, I can barely contain my excitement and anticipation at seeing  the spider Shelob, the cracks of Mount Doom and especially the battle of Gondor put to film.  It is rumoured that the battle of Gondor will  be the biggest battle scene in cinematic history.  In an interview I read Peter Jackson mentions that the grandeur of this battle will easily eclipse the epic battlle at Helm's Deep in The Two Towers.  To give an idea of just how big the battle will be consider this: At Helm's Deep there were approximately 300 middle-earthians defending the wall and 10000 Orcs trying to barge through it.  Well, multiply the number of people behind the wall by 5 and the number of Orcs by 7 and that will be the battle of Gondor.<br />Suffice to say, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  I find The Return of The King to be the most satisfying part of the trilogy.  And as for the slow moments, they are alleviated by Tolkien's beautiful artistic prose filled with ultra-clever metaphors.  There is a difference between simply reading Tolkien and understanding Tolkien and I am quite pleased to see that other reviewers have enjoyed this book as much as I have.ea of just how big the battle will be consider this: At Helm's Deep there were approximately 300 middle-earthians defending the wall and 10000 Orcs trying to barge through it.

US	41675158	R3FG7LL068FGP9	0843951818	51383965	Blood Games	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Solid entry in the Laymon catalogue	With the publication of Blood Games, Leisure Horror continues its tradition of releasing the finest of the lost Richard Laymon titles.  Originally published by the U.K. publisher Headline Feature in 1992, Blood Games is a great example of the kind of quality horror thrillers Dick used to write in the early 90's that earned him a sizeable cult following in Britain, Australia and Canada but that were sadly unpublished and mostly ignored in his native country.<br />The story centers around 5 old college friends; Abilene, Vivian, Cora, Finley and Helen.  Now in their mid-twenties, these five woman now live in separate parts of the country but once a year they leave their loved ones temporarily behind and all get together for a week's adventure in a location that each year one of them must choose.  This year, their third adventure, it's Helen's turn to choose.  Helen, a fat girl with a taste for horror, chooses The Totem Pole Lodge in rural Vermont, an abandoned former vacation spot with a sinister past.  As they settle into the lodge, the girls soon discover that the lodge and its surrounding grounds are not as deserted as they thought.  For there is a maniac lurking in the woods behind the lodge.  A maniac who salivates at the thought of plunging his knife into each one of these beautiful former co-eds.  But not before having his fun with them first...<br />As with all Laymon books, this is an extremely fast read.  The characters are so well drawn that you'll feel you know them by the end of the story.  Throughout the novel, Laymon effectively employs the use of flashbacks as a device for the reader to become more familiar with each character and the history behind their friendship.  We get to read about their initial meeting in a shower room during their freshman year of college and about their various mishaps all the way up to their senior years.  We also get to read flashbacks about their first two yearly vacations, one of them in New York City, the other along the coast of Northern California where, in an unforgettable sequence a couple of the girls meet and seduce a lone traveling surfer.  Although these flashbacks really have nothing to do with the denouement of the present-time story, they are simply fascinating nonetheless.<br />Blood Games is a book I would highly recommend.  Although not a classic, it's a solid entry in the Laymon catalogue that serves as a reminder of how engaging a writer Dick really was.  As far as the amount of sex and violence in the novel, it's only about a PG-13 by Laymon's standards.  To a Laymon fan, that would usually be a disappointing thing but Blood Games is first and foremost a character study of 5 twenty-something women and how they react when faced with peril.  Leisure Horror really is choosing well as far as which of the lost Laymons they are choosing to publish.  Up next is \\"Body Rides\\" which I've heard is a hoot and a half.coast of Northern California where, in an unforgettable sequence a couple of the girls meet and seduce a lone traveling surfer.

US	41675158	R38NWF2G6WGI6B	0451401999	808682402	Grimm Memorials (Onyx)	Books	5	24	27	N	N	A lost classic	It was purely by coincidence that I discovered R. Patrick Gates and managed to get my hands on this classic of horror.  I was at a dusty old used bookstore searching for out of print Edward Lee books.  Not surprisingly I didn't have any luck but the store owner suggested that if I liked Lee, I ought to try ought Gates.  I read the back cover and was impressed, it seemed like an ideal read for the halloween season.  I'm really glad Gates was brought to my attention because Grimm Memorials ended up being the most successfully horrifying novel I have ever read.  Ever.<br />The story centers around Steve Nailer, his pregnant wife Diane and their two kids Jackie and Jennifer.  When Steve is offered a teaching job in the small, ideallic New England town of Northwood, he jumps at the opportunity, and the Nailers soon move into a nice cozy little house on the edge of the woods.  One afternoon while the kids are exploring the woods behind their house and going maybe a little bit farther than they should, they discover an old, seemingly abandoned funeral home with a sign at the front that reads: \\"Grimm Memorials.\\"  Little do they know that a witch lives there.  An old witch named Eleanor who is seeking eternal life.  For her to gain immortal life she must perform a sacrifice on the night of Samhain that involves the sacrifice of thirteen young boys and one pregnant mother.  Only a few days are left untill the night of Samhain and Eleanour will stop at nothing to get the little boys that she needs.<br />Grimm Memorials really turned out to be the perfect halloween season read.  It takes place duing the same season, has scenes involving lost children in the woods, a gothic New England setting and a witch who has to be one of the most evil characters ever created in horror fiction.  She shows absolutely no remorse for the atrocities she commits on the children.  The gore scenes in this novel are beyond belief.  Like an Edward Lee or Charlie Jacob novel, I found the gore to be so mind-shattering that I was re-reading sentences twice just to make sure I was not hallucinating and had really read what I thought I'd read.  There are some scenes that are simply too outrageous and must be read to be believed.  One scene involves a middle-aged man in a bar who sees a gorgeous 20-something blond beauty.  Soon after, he is having sex with her right on top of a table.  What he doesn't know is that the woman he's having sex with is really the witch Eleanour who put a spell on him.  To outsiders in the bar (like the 3 college jocks at a nearby table) they are watching a guy giving it to a 90-year old woman.  This scene plays out over several pages and simply must be read to be believed.<br />I have tried to find out more about Gates but there's next to nothing about him on the internet. He wrote a handful of novels in the early to mid 90's but has seemingly dissapeared since then.  All of his novels are sadly out of print but if you can find Grimm Memorials in a used bookstore like I did don't pass it up. It's even worth hunting down if you are a fan of extreme horror looking for a book that will stretch your limits.mind-shattering that I was re-reading sentences twice just to make sure I was not hallucinating and had really read what I thought I'd read.

Scott Nicholson has received quite a lot of attention since the publication of The Red Church, his first novel.  What attracted me most to this novel was its summary at the back, which seemed original and quite elaborate for the plot of a horror paperback . Just like you would never recommend a deeply religious person to sit through The Exorcist, you would definitely not want such a person to read The Red Church either. This novel takes religious fanaticism to morbid extremes.<br />In the 1800's, reverend Wendell McFall' sermons declared the existence of the second son of God, whose mission it is to destroy the work and the existence of Jesus, God's first son. McFall had his church painted red to summon the first son to defeat the second. But when he sacrificed a newborn child to support his rantings, his congregation hung him from the rafters of the church.<br />Fast forward to present time. The Red Church still stands but has long been abandoned, used only as a site for Hallowen pranks and as a place for the young to drink and fornicate. When a mutilated body is discovered on the grounds of The Red Church by 13-year-old Ronnie and his young brother Tim, it shocks the townfolk and law enforcement officials of this peaceful and sleepy mountain community. When a second and third body are discovered, Sheriff frank Littlefield senses that these murders are not being committed by a raving lunatic or a serial killer but that The Red Church is in some way responsible. Frank doesn't think it to be a mere coincidence that theses murders started occuring when Archer McFall, a descendant of the hung preacher, returns to town and purchases The Red Church in an effort to restore it to its past glory.<br />The Red Church explores many different kinds of horrors. Things that go bump in the night, religious blasphemy, etc. There is also a nice sub-story involving the breakdown of a family unit.  David Day is a firm believer in Christ, as are his sons Ronny and Tim.  His wife Linda, however, is a fervent follower of Archer McFall's unorthodox (to say the least) Red Church. Archer's sermons encourage sacrifice as a way to purify the blood of those whose ancesters had a hand in the hanging of Wendell McFall. It's quite interesting and quite eerie to read about the inner struggles Linda faces between the love that she has for her children and her duty as a member of The Red Church to offer her children as sacrifice.<br />One thing I will say about this novel is that it is very audacious, perhaps a little bit too much so. Nicholson throws a lot of supernatural sub-stories our way such as the hung preacher, the bell monster, the temple of the two sons, etc. We get the impression while reading the novel that these elements are important to the story's denouement yet Nicholson doesn't develop or explore these concepts fully. Truth be told, there are way too many things going on in this novel of 350 pages for things to make perfect sense. Also, I found it to be a tad bit unrealistic that absolutely everyone in the mountain town of Whispering Pines is deply religious, either a zealous follower of Archer's church or of the chirch of Christ. ...<br />That said, I really enjoyed The Red Church. It is a highly original and creepy novel and as far as the minor squibbles I have about it these are not so much neatives, just things for Nicholson to improve on in his follow-up novel.believer in Christ, as are his sons Ronny and Tim.

Believe you me, Shadows does not stray very far from the formula.<br />Josh MacCallum is a ten year old with an attitude problem. He's constantly getting into fights at school, talks back at teachers and hates the fact he is living in a boring little desert town.  His problem is that he is too smart. The curriculum at school is a joke to him and he is excluded and teased by his fellow students because of his superior intellect. His mother and principle decide to send him to a private school called The Barrington Academy for young students with gifted minds like his own. For the first time in his life, Josh feels like he belongs. But then a mysterious series of student suicides leads Josh to believe that the academy may not be all it is cracked up to be. Are all these suicides coincidental or is there something more sinister behind them?<br />Shadows is quite entertaining athough it doesn't offer Saul readers anything new. The book takes a while to get going but once we learn the forces at work behind the child suicides it becomes quite interesting. Fans of Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game and the Harry Potter novels ought to enjoy this one as much as I did.	2003-10-05

He makes the average and mundane aspects of modern society like shopping, the mail system, schools, suburbia, etc. take on sinister dimensions like no other writer can. Over the last decade and a half he has consistently churned out a novel every year and in my opinion has produced the best horror fiction since 80's-era King and McCammon. For those of you who were dissapointed with last year's The Return, fret no more, Little is again in fine form here.<br />Following a recent and nasty divorce, Hunt Jackson decides to leave California behind and settle back into Tucson AZ, the neighbourhood he grew up in. Once in Tucson, he moves into a rented home, finds himself a job trimming trees and reunites with Joel, his childhood pal. Hunt is also introduced through Joel and his wife to a young woman named Beth and the two hit it off immediately. After his messy divorce, things seem to be finally looking up for him.<br />The first sign of trouble comes when Hunt discovers one day that one of the windows of his car has been cracked, an apparent act of vandalism. He calls his car insurance provider and is put through a unanimous male operator who takes down his information.The operator then asks Hunt for the approximate time of the incident. When Hunt is unable to give him a precise time, the operator becomes rude and impolite and starts singing in a twangy southern accent, \\"Half past a monkey's [tail], a quarter to his balls.\\" Shocked beyond comprehension, Hunt hangs up the phone. This will be his first bizarre experience with insurance companies but certainly not his last. In the next few weeks, he and Beth(now living together) and others residents in the Tucson area are offered increasingly bizarre insurance coverage, at a deadly cost if refused. When Hunt refuses an agent's wrongful imprisonment insurance he finds himself arrested and kicked in  jail for molesting a nine-year old girl, a crime he didn't commit. When Beth refuses the agent's dental insurance since she already has a plan through work, she finds herself with horrible steel-plated teeth. When a neighbourhood couple refuse the agent's earthquake insurance, they wake up one night to find the floor of their house shaking and soon after their entire home in a pile of rubble.<br />Anyone who has already read some of Little's work will know him to be one of the more obviously liberal and left-leaning horror writers out there. The Policy has his usual philosophising on modern society, chain stores, class divisions, capitalism. Little's focus in this novel is especially on how privatization and deregulation facilitates large companies(such as insurance companies) being able to control more and more every aspect of our lives. As Little points out, almost everything of ours seems to need insurance: our teeth, our health, our cars, our homes, our lives.<br />Little is not only a master of horror, but also a master comedian. The protagonist's first phone call to the insurance company is one of the funniest things I've ever read and anyone who has ever called an insurance company will find it very amusing as well. Did you find yourself clutching your bowels and laughing uncontrollably while reading The Store and The Association and wanting more? Then settle down and read The Policy.

More of a fantasy adventure than science fiction, it seems to me that Heinlein was very much in a transitional phase while writing this book. Well, this experiment can be considered a great success and Glory Road is a fascinating adventure well worth your time.<br />The story is told in first-person narrative by Evelyn Cyril(E.C.)Gordon, a recently discharged American soldier. Since his discharge(which he considers to be an opportunity to see the rest of the world) E.C. has been bumming around Europe and enjoying a nice laid-back and easy lifestyle. Only one problem: money is starting to run low. One morning while drinking a caf&eacute; in Nice, he spots an ad in the classifieds for a job that he feels fits him to a tee. Once he goes to the interview, he realizes the job entails much more than he bargains for.<br />Basically, his mission is to travel to a distant planet, capture a lost egg that was stolen from the planet &quot;central&quot; and return it safely to its rightful owners. Along the way, E.C. and his two travel mates encounter swordsmen, Tyrannasauruses, giants, sea creatures and a wide range of other obstacles.<br />One thing I found took that took getting used to is Heinlein's writing style. I found it to be very short-phrased and all over the place. I came pretty close to putting the book down and dismissing it as experimental garbage after the first chapter but I'm glad I stuck it through. Heinlein also injects a huge amount of his philosophies on politics, capitalism, society that are often amusing if somewhat questionable. I got the impression reading this book and Starship Troopers that Heinlein veers waaaay, waaaay to the right.<br />This is a very wild and very unique adventure that Heinlein gives us. It reads fast and is always entertaining(except for the first chapter that is). Glory Road is definitely a road worth taking.	2003-09-04

He is of Choctaw-Cherokee descent and likes to write about Native lore and legends in his works. His career started with a bang as this novel won a Bram Stoker for best novel by a new writer back in 1996. Crota is entirely deserving of such praise.<br />The story takes place in the small town of Logan in Hobbs county, Missouri. On a country road two bodies are discovered ripped to shreds and with their insides gutted out. Some members of the Logan police force think it was done by satanic cultists, others think it was related to drugs. Little Hawk, a local Shaman, knows better. He says it's the work of the &quot;Crota&quot;. Sheriff Skip Harding dismisses such talk as nonsense until he comes face to face with the creature during an emergency dispatch call. He barely survives and then enlists the help of Little Hawk to help him hunt down the Crota, who lives underground among a series of passageways and tunnels.<br />There are so many cool things in this book such as the hunt for the Crota in the underground maze and the native stories told by Little Hawk and the old indian Strong Eagle. The pages in this book really fly by for Goingback has an easy and engaging writing style that really shines throughout the book. I would recommend Crota to anyone who's in the mood for a different kind of horror  tale. It's true that there have been countless horror novels about a monster terrorizing a small town but the way Goingback combines this old formula with indian lore and mysticism is what makes &quot;Crota&quot; so refreshing and unique.	2003-08-29

Slow, plodding, overwrought, lacking in suspense...Geez, am I really reviewing a Dean Koontz novel here? The same litterary master who gave me hours upon upon hours of enjoyment with classic dark thrillers such as phantoms and watchers? I didn't want to believe reviewers who claimed that Koontz's writing has become soft and self-indulgent. But this novel, my first post-2000 Koontz read, has confirmed what I feared.<br />In most 750+page novels that I've read, the authors painted a huge canvas and created works of epic proportions that justified such immense length(see The Stand, Swan Swong, Wizard's First Rule, etc.) What we get here is a slow run-of-the-mill thriller of 768 pages that easily could have been condensed into 400. We also get sickly sweet characters that seemed to come right out of a Danielle Steele or Nora Roberts novel, and a pathetic sociopath of a villain ... For god's sake, the final confrontation between the good guys and the villain is only 10 pages long. That's pretty anti-climactic for a book of 768 pages if you ask me.<br />This is the first time that I've ever been dissappointed by Koontz. It seems that in the midst of his never-ending quest to prove that \\"I'm not a horror writer\\", he has veered away from the winning formula of his past work. I'm hoping this book was an abberation rather than an indication of what the future holds for us Dean Koontz fans.	2003-08-25

I read fiction to be engrossed and as a means to escape into another world. Timeline delivered this in spades. It is easily one of the most fulfilling novels of fiction I have ever read.<br />The first 100 pages or so of the novel deal with a professor and his graduate students studying a historic site in France as part of a school thesis. Or so they think. The professor soon finds out that the project is in reality funded through a corporation by the name of ITC, whose motives smell rather fishy to him. Upon learning this, he promptly flies back to America to have a word with the CEO of ITC. Meanwhile, the students at the site are dumbfounded about the professor's dissapearance. They don't hear anything for a while until a representative of ITC informs them that the professor is stuck in medieval France in the year 1357 and on the same site they've been researching as a result of an experimentation gone wrong using ITC's qantum travel equipment. ITC needs their help. Since these students have spent the past two summers researching the site and know it so well, ITC enlists a small group of four of them to go back in time to retrieve the professor and bring him back safely to the present time.<br />From then on the book turns into a full blown fantsy action adventure as good as any I've ever read. Not only is this book fun as hell, Crichton educates the reader on a wide range of topics: science, anthropolgy, quantum physics and of course tons of history. What amazes me is how he is able to explain these complex concepts in simple terms. The characters are very well drawn, although I found Chris to be a stumbling and bumbling idiot. If there is one thing that bothered me slightly about Timeline is that it sometimes felt to me as though Crichton was writing a movie script. As we all know, every single book of his gets the movie treatment. It will be interesting to see how Hollywood treats this novel (the movie is slated for a November 2003 release). Hopefully it will be better than \\"Sphere\\", that's all I will say on that.is slated for a November 2003 release).

The first book in the series is savage season but that novel is now out of print and quite difficult to find. Besides, I've been hearing through the grapevine that it is easily the weakest entry in Lansdale's five-book Hap&Leonard series. I felt like Mucho Mojo was the best place to start and I was not dissapointed in the least.<br />The story is set in rural East Texas in a segregated black section of the town of Laborde. Leonard's uncle Chester has recently passed away and Leonard inherits his house. While him and Hap are working on renovating the house, they discover the remains of a young child hidden in a metal chest. Leonard refuses to believe that his uncle was a child killer and convinces Hap to help him uncover the mystery behind the child's murder.<br />As always, Joe Lansdale dazzles the reader with his unique writing style. You can practically feel the heat of a Texas summer day. I would have to say the highlights of this novel were the verbal exchanges between Hap&Leonard. There was something to make me laugh on every page. Now I want to read all of the Hap&Leonard books.	2003-07-23

He waves, he smiles, he doesn't deliver junk mail or bills. But as Doug Albin comments when he first sees the mailman at a funeral, \\"there is a certain smugness and arrogance to that smile that I find disturbing\\". It doesn't take long for Doug and his family to realize that something is seriously off with the new mailman. Why would he show up at a funeral wearing his blue postal outfit among all the black-clad grievers? When the widow suddenly bursts in tears, why is he grinning as though he's enjoying the site? Why is he delivering the mail at 3 in the morning?<br />This is a book that starts slow, builds up tension and when you least expect it goes straight for the throat and kicks out all the stops. Before reading this novel, it never occured to me just how much we depend on the mail and the chaos that would ensue if someone were to screw around with the mail system. There's no doubt that this is in the top tier of Bentley Little books. It holds a place in the holy trinity of Bentley Little social satires, along with \\"The Store\\" and \\"The Ignored\\". Read and enjoy.	2003-07-13

Instead of rehashing the well-beaten path of formulaic horror, it tries something new. I once read in an issue of Fangoria that Clegg struggled mightily writing this novel and actually took upwards of ten years to finish this book. Sadly, instead of delivering its promise, the novel falls flat on its face.<br />The story flip flops between two time frames. THEN takes place in 1980 in the sleepy desert town of Palmetto, California. We get to meet several teenage characters whose routine lifestyles are turned upside down when a demonic force takes over them and makes them perform brutal acts of murderous rage. NOW is set in 2000 and the teenagers are now grown adults living in different cities across the country and doing their best to forget the horrible memories of their past. But now the demon of their past is &quot;calling&quot; them and they will reunite in Palmetto in an attempt to put the demon that haunts them to rest once and for all.<br />This is not an easy book to read. So much of the events take place through dreams, memories, hallucinations and flashbacks. After a while it becomes hard to decipher what's real from what's not as well as if something's occuring now or if it happenned in the past.<br />The main secret behind this book seems to be of what ritual the kids performed that was so terrifying and that ended up scarring them emotionally. However, as I read deeper into the novel I found that I really didn't care anymore. Most of them have become dislikeable burnouts and schizophrenics that are difficult to sympathize with. The most thrilling part of the book was actually reading about two elderly ladies sitting on rocking chairs on their porch and recounting events of 40 years ago. How sad.<br />One major positive is that the ending is strong. But the last 50 pages still don't make up for the mud that were the first 350. After reading this exhaustive and confusing novel, I'm hesitating reading anything else by this author. Too bad because I liked its concept.

Christopher Golden is quite adept at capturing the mood of summer for young men growing into adolescence. His skill in capturing this mood is almost on a par with the great book Boy's Life by Robert Mccammon(I said almost! Mccammon's THE KING after all...).<br />In the first half of the book, we are introduced to Kevin Murphy, his brother Jessie, and their friends. They're typical carefree teengagers enjoying their summer. Kevin has a major crush on the girl next door Nikkie but he just can't bring himself to tell her. He loves the time they spend as friends and is hoping for something more. It all comes crashing down when she falls for this dark &amp; mysterious older dude by the name of Pete Starling. Starling and his 3 buddies are troublemakers who are able to do inexplicable things(this is the part that reminds me of The Lost Boys). Starling and his thugs eventually kidnap Nikkie and bring her to &quot;Neverland&quot;, an alternate world where few humans have ever ventured. Thus begins the second half of the book where Kevin, his brother and two friends embark on a mission to Neverland to save Nikkie. From now on, the book becomes a full-blown fantasy adventure complete with trolls, goblins, sea creatures and the like.<br />Straight on til' morning definitely entertains. Should you choose to read this, your eyes will be glued to the pages and you'll be turning them so quickly as to risk several papercuts(be careful!). Of course, there are some minor flaws. For one, this book seems to suffer of an identity crisis. Is it coming-of age, horror or fantasy? What is the intended audience? There came times where I felt I was reading a scholastic young-adult novel (like the author's Buffy books) and others where I felt I was reading something intended for an older audience. I also wish the author had decided to shift the story to Neverland earlier. We don't actually get there until past the midway point of the novel. But once we're there, whoa what a ride! If you're looking for good summer escapism, you'll definitely find what you're looking for through the pages of this fine novel.decided to shift the story to Neverland earlier.

This statement definitely applies to \\"The Lost\\"<br />The opening chapter is set in 1965 when 3 teenagers, Jennifer, Tim & Ray, go on a camping trip in an isolated part of New Jersey. They assume that in these woods they'll be alone but they're wrong. 2 female campers share another spot nearby. Ray, a sociopathic greaser who likes to wear cowboy boots and hates the Beatles assumes(incorrectly) that the two are lesbians when he sees them kiss each other on the lips while spying on them. He then decides to off them with his revolver for no other good reason then that \\"they're lesbos man, they deserve to die\\".<br />Fast forward to 1969. Nobody has yet found out who killed the two females in the woods four years earlier but deputy Charles Schilling does. He knows it's Ray but for the last four years his efforts to tie him to the crimes have had no success. He is intent on making Ray pay for his crimes no matter what the cost..<br />The author seems to capture the mood of the sixties real well(though I wouldn't know for sure being an 80's child). There are references to Woodstock, drugs, the Beatles, the stones, etc.He even ties the story in with the Sharon Tate murders of 69'. More of a thriller than a horror novel, \\"The Lost\\" is a very engaging read with many well-drawn characters.	2003-06-07

It has none of the supernatural effects or heavy gore that you would expect from most of his novels. It does, however have plenty of sex(how could there ever be a Laymon novel without it, he he).<br />I don't think anyone who has read the book could argue with me when I say that this is not a horror novel. It's really more of a police/crime novel in the mold of Ed McBain or Jonathan Kellerman. Although I admire Laymon's effort to branch into new territory, Among the Missing unfortunately misses the mark. For one, the length of the novel(300 pages) is way too short for all the red herrings Laymon throws at us and the ending feels rushed. Once the book ended, I found myself asking \\"well, what happens to this character, or this character?\\" It's not that I felt Laymon owed me a happy ending, but I at least felt like he should have given some sort of insight as to what happens to the characters after the final climactic battle scene.<br />Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad novel at all. It's just that you could read so much better. If you're looking for a crime novel, you'd be better to stick to the big guns like Kellerman, et.al who do it way better. If you're looking for a great Laymon horror shocker, try exploring some of his better works such as Island, Funland, In the Dark, all of which are deserving of 5-star ratings.	2003-05-28

It is not especially long(at just under 300 pages) and is written in an engaging first-person narrative.<br />The story follows a middle-aged family man by the name of Burke Devore who loses his job to downsizing. After 2 long years of fruitless job searching, he comes to the conclusion that the only way for him to find work again in his field is to \\"eliminate\\" the competition. He vows to kill the manager of a paper mill plant who has the job he believes should be his. He also manages to gather up the resumes of other applicants who he feels would have a better chance than him of getting the job he wants and kills them off too!<br />While I certainly did not agree with Burke's actions, I found his insights and social commentaries to be fascinating. All in all this is a very good read, it's just very disturbing in that \\"Brett Easton Ellis American Psycho\\" kind of way.	2003-05-23
US	41675158	R3MJNLO0OCNGS5	0843949880	48429437	City Infernal	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A wild, entertaining ride.	City Infernal is one of the most enteratining novels I've read in quite a while. The concept is pure genius: Two twin sisters get into an argument over a guy while at a D.C. goth club. When her sister Lisa commits suicide right in front of her, Cassie(and to a certain extent her dad) enters a state of semi-depression. To help forget these horrid events of the past, Cassie and her dad move to a secluded mansion in a quiet hillbilly town. As Cassie learns from a local redneck who is well versed in the town's folklore and legends, the mansion she has moved in has a very dark past and a history of violence. There is also a portal in the mansion that leads straight to hell, where Cassie embarks on a mission to locate her dead sister(people who commit suicide go straight to hell, you see).<br />Lee's vision of hell is not vastly different from our world. Hell is not a pit of flames but a modern city with bars, public transportation, and people who work to make a living. But instead of peace and justice, chaos is enforced and encouraged.<br />Lee does not spare any details (or pull any stops) when describing his vision of hell. It is all done in very imaginative and gruesome fashion. I was also impressed by what Lee wrote about the goth scene. He really nails it when describing the kind of mood and music (Bauhaus, Killing Joke, Front 242, to name but a few)that permeates from this subculture. It's obvious Lee spent a lot of time researching the goth scene while writing this book.<br />Just so you know: This is not a novel of 'big thinks'. It's more like the last movie of a triple-header at the drive-in. Fast, cheesy and fun. Hey, nothing wrong with that!!	2003-05-18

Clark does a great job of developing the setting and the characters. We really do get to care and feel for John and his family, and old man Stan Price. The evils in this novel are not seen or described, only felt. They are open to the reader's imagination.<br />Just a warning before reading: Don't expect another Blood Crazy. With Blood Crazy, Clark served up an epic, over-the-top, roller-coaster ride of horror violence that was unlike anything I'd ever read before. Darkness Demands is very different. It uses subtleness and old folklore to create an old-fashioned ghost story. No matter your tastes in horror, I highly recommend this book. I will remember Darkness Demands for many years to come.	2003-05-05

I don't quite understand why it rarely gets mentioned as such. The author himself has stated this is his least favourite book alongside \\"Death Instinct\\". And it seems to fly under the radar of a lot of fans too. But believe me, Dominion is an extremely accomplished piece of work by this talented author. This book is many things all rolled into one: Splatterpunk, love story, greek mythology. It is probably Little's most extreme novel as far as sex and gratuitous gore goes. Only \\"University\\" comes close. This is a great introduction to Bentley Little and long-time fans will enjoy it too.	2003-04-21

It sounded like it would be in the vein and vision of James Cameron's \\"Dark Angel\\", one of my favourite T.V. shows of all time. Also the No-Cal and So-Cal concept sounded neat. However, the back cover summary turned out to be the best thing about this mess; this novel is terrible.<br />The main thing I have to complain about with Virtual Light is the author's writing style. It is immensely confusing and short-phrased. After the first few chapters, I felt completely lost, and thought to myself: Who is this? What is that? Obviously Gibson did not feel the need to develop characters. I completely agree with an earlier reviewer who pointed out that Gibson writes as though him and the reader are sharing some kind of inside joke. I have 3 words for Gibson; Background, Character, Development!! One can not get thrown into the middle of a story without any development whatsoever and be expected to figure out things by himself but this is exactly what Gibson does to the reader. I'll admit that Gibson has a very active imagination, however the way he writes frustrates me to no end.<br />So for those of you looking for a good cyberpunk read, I would recommend looking elsewhere. I'm going to try Neal Stephenson's \\"snow crash\\" next, hopefully I won't be as dissapointed.	2003-04-21

The tale follows 4 teenagers who become trapped in a drive-in by a mysterious force-field. From then on things become more and more chaotic; biker-gangs, cannibalism, religious fanatics, hippies, the popcorn king are but a few of the things you will encounter while reading this.  The second novel is just as good although radically different. I don't think I will ever be able to forget the character of poppalong cassidy.

With the colour of magic, it seems to me that Pratchett was still refining his writing chops and that this installment is inferior to his later discworld efforts.<br />Sure, The Colour of Magic introduces you to the nuances of the discworld, but the first half of the book is incredibly dull and pointless. I'm told the second book in this series is much better, maybe I'll check that one out next. An okay read, but for completists only. As discworld is not a continuous series, you can skip this one and explore one of his later, better efforts instead.	2003-04-21

This is the perfect book for those of us constantly searching for a better place, a better life. In this novel, this utopia consists of a secluded beach off the beaten tourist path of Thailand. Backpackers from different parts of the world assemble here and form their own distinct society, away from the pressures of every-day modern society. Except that in Garland's novel, this perfect world soon comes crashing down and dissolves into a tale of madness, revenge and drug addiction.<br />Garland's use of first-person narrative is very engaging and he has a writing style that makes for fast and easy reading.

I can't stand it when authors gratuitously inject their political opinions into their work.  This felt more like a political statement and history lesson than a work of fiction.<br /><br />And for those of you looking for the same kind of jaw-dropping action that you witnessed in the movie, look elsewhere. The pace is slow and the battle sequences are sporadic.<br /><br />Although I admire the prodigious talents of this visionary sci-fi author, I could not bring myself to enjoy this book. Even though Starship Troopers won a Hugo Award for best novel back in 1960, it also signified the beginning of Heinlen's decline, a period where he wrote sci-fi novels not for escapism but instead for preaching his political and sociological opinions. For better entertainment value, watch Paul Verhoeven's excellent film adaptation instead.  The film is an action classic but the book is not.	2003-04-14

Why is it that whenever someone writes an epic, end-of the world horror novel everyone claims it to be ripping off the King book?  Just like Robert McCammon's \\"Swan Song\\", \\"Black Dawn\\" has a similar premise to The Stand but the author then takes things into a completely different direction.<br />True, this is not a great book.  Good, but not great. The author creates way too many characters for a book of this size(400 pages only). Worse, some of the characters he creates that you would think are essential to the story's development get killed off swiftly and quickly just when you start to get to like them.<br />It's true that writing an end-of-the-world book on an epic scale and with a dozen characters in only 400 pages seems like a daunting task. However, Simon Clark did it quite well with \\"Blood Crazy\\" as did Yvonne Navarro with \\"Final Impact\\". D.A. Stern doesn't do so well, however. But let's not call this a Stand ripoff when it is not. If we keep doing this, writers will shy away from writing this type of horror novel, which would be a shame.	2002-05-26
US	41675158	R30HYAZQRPPAJK	078670389X	91341835	Writer of the Purple Rage	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Trailer trash, East Texas style.	Is Texas life really like Joe Lansdale portrays it? If so, I'll stay away. The characters in his stories make the guests of Jerry Springer seem classy in comparison.  Nonetheless, his stories make for very enjoyable reads.<br />\\"Writer of the purple rage\\" is a collection of 15 short stories, most of them likely to be weirder than anything you've ever read.  Here's what some of the stories focus on:<br /><br />-A plastic love-doll comes to life<br />-Godzilla grows a conscience and enters a rehab program<br />-A baby's diaper gets possesed by aliens<br />-An old man in a rest home who thinks he's Elvis hops in his<br /> wheelchair and battles a swamp monster.<br />I know some of this sounds a little cheesy, but don't worry, Lansdale somehow manages to pull it off. The only reason this does not get 5 stars is that like just about every short story collection, there are a couple of duds, like \\"the diaper\\", which plays like Robert McCammon's \\"Pin\\" on speed. But 2 bad stories out of a collection of 15 is nothing to crow about.<br />Oh, and for those of you who enjoy low-budget horror and b-movies, you'll get a real kick out of \\"Hard-on for horror\\", a non-fiction short where Lansdale explains his fascination with the b-movie.<br />Now that I've read this, I can't wait to get my hands on \\"High Cotton\\", another short story collection by this great author.	2002-05-11

This book is an excellent introduction to this vast country that is Australia.  In his journal, Bryson recounts all of his adventures and all of his yawns while down under. And he goes everywhere too! Whatever part of Australia you might be interested in whether it be Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Cairns, Darwin, Alice Springs, Perth or Surfer's Paradise it's all in this book.<br />Unlike most travel companions that try to convince you that every spot is worth your time, Bryson is brutally honest.  If a place is boring and the pits, he'll let you know.<br />I definitely recommend this book both as a travel guide and as a comic adventure. Bill Bryson's writing style is hilarious.  The only people I might not recommend this book to are those who might not have the time or financial resources to ever go to Australia. After reading In a Sunburned Country, you'll wish you were there.	2002-04-07
US	41675158	R2A5HNSD1WC31R	0553288342	469487782	Sleepwalk	Books	4	4	5	N	N	More than meets the eye	21-hour flights to Australia can be a tedious affair, but thanks to John Saul's sleepwalk, I managed to stay entertained.<br />This book contains a lot more than meets the eye. The back cover description is a little on the cheesy side, something about a person who hates teenagers, those troublemakers, they must die!<br />But Saul weaves together great characters and great suspense into something that gradually builds into a truly horrifying concept: The evils that can grow from mass corporate greed and the extent to which it's lords will go to turn everyone into loyal minions and servants.<br />Especially interesting are the chapters about Borrego oil and it's struggles with their Union. Well done Mr. Saul!	2002-03-21
US	41675158	R2EQVODJOCUSGY	0843949783	372932416	Island	Books	5	3	9	N	N	One of his very best.	I am not one to award 5 stars to a book very often but this deserves it. Island is my favorite Laymon and believe me, I've read lots(21 and counting). This novel is very unique in the sense that not only is it narrated in the first person, but the events actually take place while the narrator is writing them.<br />We follow the adventures of Rupert Conway, a college student who goes on a spring break trip in the bahamas with his girlfriend and the rest of her family on their private boat. While setting shore on a tiny remote island, the bloat blows up, thus stranding its passengers. Of course many other things will go wrong along the way.<br />Fast-paced, voyeuristic, violent and sadistic, this will undoubtedly please all Richard Laymon fans old and new.	2002-03-11
US	41675158	RFF0MPJDTNNKN	0385259980	758969251	Drive: How Vince Carter Conquered the NBA	Books	2	6	7	N	N	More about the Raptors than about vince...	With his first published book, Toronto Star sports columnist Chris Young has compiled an impressive collection of stories and events from the last 3 years of Toronto Raptors basketball. Regular readers of his newspaper column will be pleased to find out that the same sharp wit and sense of humour displayed in his sports column are apparent throughout this book as well.<br />The main problem I have with DRIVE is that it turns out to be more of a book on the Raptors organization as a whole than on Carter himself. Young devotes entire chapters to the likes of Tracy Mcgrady, Butch Carter, Isiah Thomas, Glen Grunwald, etc that have little or no connection to Vince Carter himself. Very little is devoted to Carter's childhood growing up in Florida or about his college career, or other historical moments about his life you would expect to find in a supposed biography.<br />So if you want to read about the Raptors, this is a good book. If you are hoping to get insight into Vince Carter's life beyond what you've read or seen in the media in the last three years, you'll be truly dissapointed.	2001-10-01
