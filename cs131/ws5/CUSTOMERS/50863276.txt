She was the embodiment of what she teaches in her book.<br /><br />She says in her book that we are headed towards a calamity that only working together for the common good can avoid.  She states categorically that only be equalizing men and women can we reach for that which seems unattainable.  Her philosophy attempts to get you to answer some of the greatest questions of all time.  It is through those answers that we, as humans, can achieve greatness.<br /><br />She was convinced, as I am, that without a true knowledge of God we are nothing.  She then attempts to answer the challenge that she sets forth to get people to stop the headlong decline and fall of the human race before we exterminate ourselves.  Lao was convinced that even one person, acting correctly, could change the world.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that since her death, her book has largely been forgotten, and the University of Science and Philosophy that her and her husband co-founded has lost the rights to the wonderful Swannanoa and its marvelous gardens.  Even Walter Russell's fabulous sculptures are in storage somewhere - unseen in the public eye.<br /><br />Get a copy and read it - it may just convince you, too, to help change the world.	2005-04-10

Some info on Baum such as biography, the order of his stories, publication dates, and other stuff would have been nice.<br /><br />But this is a great collection as is and well worth the very small price.

Monterny's unique power to read and control the thoughts of others extends far enough so that he may control the actions of his evil mutant corps while safely hidden in his lair in Salt Lake City, Utah - and his operatives are in the Gobi Desert!

Rhodan has Marshall contact the Venusian seals - semi-intelligent animals that live in the seas of Venus to help them get into the Venusian secret base.  Meanwhile, Rhodan's enemies, the rebels against the new power, who have Thora (the Arkonide beauty) captive, are also nearing the Venusian base.  Thora's captors are menaced by a Venusian Tyrex - a monster similar to the Terran Tyrannosaurus, but far larger and more voracious.  There's also a cool scene with gigantic ants.<br /><br />Of course, everyone knows that Perry will resuce Thora and put down the rebellion.

Perry takes a spaceship and attempt to rescue her, only to realize that the ship he has flown has no radio code for the secret Venusian base.  Accordingly, the super computer turns on all Venusian defenses, effectively sealing the planet against any further landings.  Perry and his small crew must fight on land - a land swarming with Venusian monsters and storms.<br /><br />Thora's group is eventually captured by a second rebel group - a group that does not like the first rebel group, nor do they like the rule of the New Power.  Perry allows Thora to remain in their camp - not only to teach her a lesson, but to allow her to cause confusion and strife among the rebels.

But she has problems, and is eventually captured by the few survivors of the ill-fated rebels against the new power's attempt to get to the Venusian base in \\"Venus in Danger\\".<br /><br />Thora has several adventures in the steaming swamps of Venus, similar to the previous book, before her eventual capture by the rebels.

But there is no time for shore leave.  Rhodan and his men find that their secret base on Venus is threatened by - not the usual bug-eyed aliens, but a group of determined humans.  These rebels against the new power of Perry Rhodan attempt to take over the Venus base without success, but they do succeed in activating the base defenses - forcing Rhodan and crew to approach the base on foot in order to deliver a secret code to deactivate the base defenses.  The crawl thru the swamps of Venus - infested with huge snails and winged monsters should remind anyone of the time when we knew very little about this cloud shrouded planet.

In book 12 of this Space Opera, Rhodan & crew take a detour from their quest for the Planet of Eternal Life.<br /><br />After the adventures of \\"The Planet of the Dying Sun\\", Rhodan's seemingly final jump to the Planet of Eternal Life is interrupted by a miscalculation in the hyper jump transition.  But is it a mistake?  It turns out that the coordinates were intentionally reset by a stowaway.  When they finally find their extra passenger, they are surprised to find it is one of the mouse-beavers from the planet Vagabond that they just left.  But this mouse-beaver is different from its companions.  It, too, is a mutant.  Although his powers of telekinesis and telepathy are common for its kind, his ability to remain intelligent for the entire day and night is unique.<br /><br />The little Mouse-Beaver (who is, at first, christened \\"Emby\\") proves invaluable during Rhodan's side quest to Tuglan.  The new coordinates have taken the Stardust to an Arkonide ruled planet many light years from either Vagabond, or the Planet of Eternal Life, or Vega.  Rhodan and friends must discover who the real \\"Rebels of Tuglan\\" are and stop them.  But are the rebels to help the ones that want to receive freedom from Arkonide rule, or are the rebels to help the ones that want to remain part of the Arkonide Empire?  You'll be surprised at the answer to that question.  From here we move to the conclusion of this \\"band\\" - \\"The Immortal Unknown\\".<br /><br />At the very end of this book, you finally get to read the final name of the little mouse-beaver - a character who will become a vital member of Rhodan's Mutant Corps, and an equally important \\"foil\\" for Reginald Bell.  \\"Emby's\\" relationship with Bell, which reminds me so much of the love/hate relationship between Star Trek's Spock and Dr. McCoy, becomes a great tension reliever in later books, and one of my favorite things to read.<br /><br />I've never been this impressed by a series.

Using a small space fighter, Rhodan eventually discovers that they are near a huge dying sun that only has one planet.  They begin to explore that planet and discover a contradiction.  There are glowing globes of gas that project waves of hatred at any mutant capable of telepathy.  There is also another thought - a thought of play time.  Rhodan quickly realizes that these two thoughts are from two races of beings.  The glowing globes are the source of the hatred.  Not until all the glowing globes are destroyed do the telepathic mutants get any relief from the thoughts of hate.  Rhodan also discovers that the thoughts of playtime come from the other inhabitants of the planet - a race of beings that can only be described as \\"mouse-beavers\\".<br /><br />Due to unusual events that keep happening to items on their spaceship, they eventually discover a clue in, believe it or not, the mouse-beaver caves, and then continue their quest for the Planet of Eternal Life.

This vault is protected, not by locks or bars, but by time itself.  Rhodan manages to unlock the secrets of the vault, and takes his crew into a matter transmitter in the center of the vault.  From there, they are transported by a mysterious unknown power to a huge storage facility somewhere in space.  Rhodan's Mutant Corps proves invaluable once they begin to explore the machines in the underground base.

Great homage to the old cliffhanger stories.<br /><br />Meanwhile, one of Rhodan's pilots discovers a small pyramid on one of the moons of Vega's system.

Perry is only to happy to agree. Terra is only about 27 light years away - a mere skip when compared to a long hyper jump.<br /><br />It turns out the Topides expected to find the wreck of the Arkonide ship on Ferrol - a few small miscalculations led them to Vega instead of Sol. Perry and his Mutant Corps make sure the Topides are sent on their way. I won't reveal what happens to the Topidian fleet, but I will tell you that we meet the Topides again much later in the series.<br /><br />This book also contains another editorial by Forrest J Ackerman (his wife translated these books), another short review of Science Fiction movies, and another page of letters from fans.<br /><br />I really enjoy these books, and feel sorry every time I write a review that some enterprising publisher doesn't pick them up for reprinting and continuing the series.

Rhodan and his Mutant Corps have to fight the base's defenses in order to take it over before it, too, can send a signal to it's alien masters.  I loved the deja-vu that the jungles of Venus (which we all know scientifically cannot exist) created - it took me back to a time when man knew very little about Venus - or any of our other neighboring planets either.<br /><br />This is one of the books that reminded me most of the older space operas like \\"Buck Rodgers\\" and \\"Flash Gordon\\".  Huge planetary fortresses, human minds over seemingly vastly superior alien technology - and winning.  I highly recommend this as a good book to decide if you want to try the rest.	2004-11-13

Contract negotiations had stalled, and there was a severe lapse in publication, but for quite a while that lapse was to be nullified.<br /><br />\\"Secret of the Time Vault\\" became the first Rhodan novel to be published almost exactly the way it had been in Germany - complete with editorials, illustrations, and a readers department.<br /><br />But that doesn't mean that this story wasn't just as entertaining as the first five.<br /><br />With the aid of his Mutant Corps, Perry Rhodan begins the human quest to complete what his Arkonide friends had been looking for when they crash landed on the moon - the Planet of Eternal Life.  Rhodan cracks the Secret of the Time Vault with the aid of his mutant friends and prepares us to discover \\"The Fortress of the Six Moons\\"<br /><br />I found the readers department (at the time of publication) to be invaluable.  Here, so many years before the Internet and Instant Messaging and Web Pages, was a way for me to not only get in touch with the translators of a book I really enjoyed, but with fellow fans as well.<br /><br />Here is the start of a very short \\"band\\" - or series of interconnected stories.  It comes to it's prime conclusion several books from this one.  Get everything through the \\"The Planet of Eternal Life\\" and I think you'll be just as \\"hooked\\" as I was.	2004-11-13

Rhodan's only recently constructed \\"Good Hope\\" crash lands on a planet of humanoids that is facing the might of the Topidian fleet.  Rhodan and his mutant allies quickly contact the remaining human freedom fighters and help them to drive off the Topides.<br /><br />In part two, \\"Mutants In Action\\", Perry Rhodan gives his Mutant Corps something to fight for - they attempt to overcome the Topidian crew of a giant space cruiser - easily several times the size of the (now relatively small) Good Hope.  With the aid of the Mutants and the Vegan freedom fighters, Rhodan captures the giant space sphere and sends the remnants of the Topide fleet into quick retreat.  Rhodan also discovers that the Vegans have access to matter transmitters - a technology that seems to be far in advance of what they normally are capable of.  Rhodan secures the plans for these matter transmitters and with them is ready to discover \\"The Secret of the Time Vault\\".<br /><br />This is one of the books that reminded me most of the older space operas like \\"Buck Rodgers\\" and \\"Flash Gordon\\".

These are just two of the over 125 American translations of the over 1800 German stories of Perry Rhodan - the Peacelord of the Universe.<br /><br />In the first section, \\"The Radiant Dome\\", we find out more about Rhodan and his cause - as well as the attempts by the three major world powers to prevent it from happening.  However, the combined forces of the American Bloc, the Russian Bloc, and the Asian Bloc succeed in seemingly destroying what remains of the Arkonide vessel on the moon.<br /><br />However, it is the second section, \\"Twilight of the Gods\\" where we begin to see how Rhodan will actually be able to succeed in his quest to not only unify Earth's governments into a single Terran power, but to extend that reach into space.<br /><br />The Mutants begin to appear in this novel - John Marshall the telepath, Anne Sloane the telekinetic, Ras Tschubai the teleporter, and Ernst Elbert - the time traveller.  Fans of the X-Men will like the similarities to their favorite characters in these individuals, and readers will meet many more of Rhodan's \\"Mutant Corps\\" eventually.<br /><br />Readers will enjoy the faster pace of discoveries that continue to lead you deeper and deeper into this wonderful world.  It's easy to see why there's been over 1800 stories of Rhodan and hundreds of related books about Rhodan's friends.  I've managed (finally!) to collect all of the American editions, and I felt moved to learn to speak, read, and write German so that I could continue the stories after they unfortunately left off with only 125 or so printed in English.  Hopefully, new readers will discover this fantastic Space Opera and cause it to come back into print in English.	2004-11-08

In \\"Galactic Alarm\\" we are treated with two more translations of German stories.<br /><br />In section one, \\"Galactic Alarm\\", we find the Arkonide ship that was destroyed in \\"The Radiant Dome\\" managed to send off a distress signal to the universe.  Perry Rhodan and friends have only had a few days to get used to the situation that they created when they landed in the Gobi desert, and now must use all their wits and new-found Arkonide knowledge to start preparing Earth for what may be possible rescue missions - or worse.<br /><br />Krest gives Rhodan and Bell Arkonide memory treatments that increase both their knowledge and brain capacity.  Using this, along with the Mutants he has already discovered, he begins putting more pieces of his future plans for Terra into place.<br /><br />In the second part, \\"Mutant Corps\\", Perry puts out even more feelers for what he thinks needs to be done to bring what he now calls \\"The Third Power\\" into existence.  It's rather funny to read about Homer Adams and his manipulation of the world stock markets, but that's only after he only manages to escape from criminals that want him dead for his earlier activities.<br /><br />But we also see the start of the first Invasion of Earth.  Mind controlling parasites begin to take over the bodies of prominent people in order to conquer Earth.  We will not see the conclusion of this story in this volume, and this is the start of where the old stand by of the cliffhanger comes into play.<br /><br />In Germany, these book/magazines are published weekly - and have been since day one.  It did not take long for the next installment of the story to reach readers.  But here in America, in was a few months before we saw any more of \\"The Invasion of Space\\".<br /><br />Here is the volume that will either get you into the spirit of the stories or not.  If you find yourself wanting to find out what happens next, just pick up \\"Invasion From Space\\" - and the rest of the series.	2004-11-08

The series is still being produced on a weekly basis.<br /><br />In \\"Enterprise Stardust\\" were are introduced to the major characters for the next few years.  Two humans, Major Perry Rhodan, commander of the first nuclear powered rocket to the moon, and Captain Reginald Bell become embroiled in an interstellar conflict when they find not only the ruins of a gigantic spaceship on the moon, but they also realize that it is still occupied!<br /><br />Krest, an Arkonide Scientist, and the military commander, Thora, are found in the ship, along with a few other Arkonides.  Krest gives Rhodan access to some of his civilization's fantastic creations in exchange for a promise to attempt to cure a strange disease that he has.<br /><br />Upon arrival on Earth, Rhodan takes what seems to be at first glance to be a stupid idea - he realizes that the nations of Earth are not ready to handle the technology of the Arkonides, and lands the ship in the middle of the Gobi desert and activates a special force field (of Arkonide design) over the ship.  He uses this base to start what will eventually be a galactic empire based on Earth (or what Perry calls \\"Terra\\").<br /><br />Meanwhile, he sends a couple crewmembers to retrieve the material Krest needs for his condition.  One is captured, but the other returns, not only with the medicine Krest needs, but a doctor to administer it to him.<br /><br />This is a very good novel in the best tradition of E. E. (Doc) Smith.  It's not good scifi, but it's great Space Opera.  Don't let the seemingly slow pace of the first American edition stop you from enjoying this fantastic series.  Turn off the logical portion of your mind and sit back and enjoy the story of what happens when one man is given almost limitless powers.  It doesn't take Rhodan long to determine that \\"with great power comes great responsibility\\".<br /><br />Well worth picking up an issue or two for traders, as the originals have been out-of-print for sometime.

I happened to find a copy of &quot;Illustrated Tarot Spreads&quot; in a used book store recently, and I must say I wish I had sprung and bought a copy earlier.<br />The main feature of this book are the 78 different Tarot card spreads in this book - that's one for every card in the Tarot deck.  That's a lot of spreads, and thus you might find that some of them aren't &quot;right&quot; for you.<br />I've been reading a long time, and I generally use a &quot;Tree of Life&quot; spread when reading for my friends, and a &quot;Celtic Cross&quot; when reading for people I don't know.  But this book provides tools to read for both of those types of readings, as well as plenty in between.<br />The authors start with an introduction to Tarot cards, as many books geared to beginners do.  There's a nice section about Using the Tarot properly, and an unusual section dealing with a &quot;Sum of the Digits&quot; card that might add a new facet to readings.  Then there's a short guide to interpreting meanings of cards, followed by a section that allows you to select your significator - your own personal Tarot card.<br />Then we finally get into the meat of this book - the 78 different Tarot reading spreads.  I found some of the beginning spreads such as the three card &quot;Know Thyself&quot; and the four card &quot;Reaching the Goal&quot; too simple for an in depth reading, but they might be OK for an answer to a simple question or a surface reading.  There are two instances of using the Celtic Cross arrangement - one for your use on yourself and another with prompts for using it on others.  There's three occurrences of the &quot;Tree of Life&quot; layout I like to use - one labeled &quot;as the Tarot sees it&quot;, one labeled &quot;of the seven levels&quot;, and one labeled &quot;My World&quot;.  The prompts for discovering the meanings of the cards in the layout are different for each, but I would have been happier had there only been one occurrence of each type of layout.<br />One of my favorite sections was the Astrological signs.  There are layouts for each sign of the Zodiac, as well as a general Astrological sign layout.  Each includes ways to find out what each card means in that layout.  I plan on using this to tailor my deeper readings of people I don't know well based on their star sign.<br />The book ends with a fantastic &quot;Structure of Life&quot; layout using 34 cards.  Labeled &quot;The Total Human Being&quot;, it is broken down into easily digestible sections each dealing with a different facet of things that normally come up in readings.  I am now using this layout for thorough readings for friends.<br />This is a good book for beginners, and a fine book to add to the experienced Tarot Card reader's library.

As a frequent Tarot reader for young people, I find myself having to give meanings for cards to participants over and over again.  But that stopped just as soon as I discovered the Gill Tarot.  I've worn out two decks of Gill Tarot cards, and am now on my third deck.<br /><br />The pictures of both the Major and Minor Arcana are very beautiful and colorful.  The backs contain a Tree of Life and the symbols for it.  A great deal of the symbolism that inspired these cards comes directly from classical religious literature.  The one thing I didn't like about the backs is that the Tree of Life background makes it obvious when reversed cards are dealt.  But, since Elizabeth Gill recommends not using reversed meanings with her deck, maybe that's not such a bad thing after all.<br /><br />The cards are a strange oversize, a little wider than quite a few of the other deck in my small collection.  There's a small white border around the art, and names on all the cards.  But I found the width easy to use, and the cards seemed to have good stiffness, without being too hard or inflexible.<br /><br />The Major Arcana are enough like the standard Rider/Waite Tarot to be understandable to even a novice, but have enough symbolism to enchant the most dedicated readers.  But it is the Minor Arana that stopped most of my questions from younger subjects.  All of the Minor Arcana have a single word written on them to provide a basic meaning for that card.  Although some may find this limiting, simple readings do not have to be an in depth look at the soul - just answers to simple questions.  And the same level of symbolism is on all of the Minor Arcana - so if you want to \\"wing it\\" you can.<br /><br />The small included 24 page booklet gives you the basics of these cards as well as a sample layout - and it's not a Celtic Cross either!  It's a simplified \\"Tree of Life\\" layout that can add a great deal of richness and depth to a standard reading.<br /><br />I find myself being drawn back to this deck over and over again from the ones I own.  A good second deck for beginners, and experienced readers will find new meanings in Gill's cards.  If you haven't seen it, it has one of my highest recommendations.rom the ones I own.

I find the meanings on the Minor Arcana particularly useful for this, although some may find this initial definition limiting.<br />But Gill's book gives much more versatility to Gill's wonderfully illustrated cards by giving more in depth definitions of the card images that she chose for each of the Major and Minor Arcana.  There's much more in the full book than is in the 24 page booklet that is provided with just the cards.  And there's much more to the Minor Arcana than the simple definitions Gill decided to print on each card - and this book gives those definitions.<br />The Gill Tarot has a great deal of Jewish Kabbalistic symbolism - only some of which I caught even on continued use.  Like a couple of the reviewrs before me, I now find myself being drawn into a study of the Kabbalah and its meanings - a study that these cards began and that these cards will probably help me with.  The Tree of Life, a continuing symbol of Gill's Tarot, is an important part of many mystic journeys, especially Kabbalistic ones, and this deck of cards will assist you while travelling down that narrow path that can only be defined by you.<br />There's enough info for beginners in this book, but the serious student will find something to like as well.  One of my higher recommendations.	2003-04-20

I don't own very many Tarot decks - I've never been interested in collecting them.  I'm a lot more interested in using a deck that speaks to me - a deck that allows me to be a better reader for others.<br />I find the vibrant colors and highly evocative imagery of this deck to be one of the more interesting I've ever used.  The basic images aren't that different from other decks that you won't know what the cards mean anymore, but they're different enough to allow you to gain a whole new insight on the Tarot by using this deck.<br />The four cards that are shown in the picture section give you a good idea of what some of the cards from this deck look like.  I'm particularly fond of the secondary interpretations that one can divine from these cards.  Are those Gypsy children getting a drink from the cups on the stairs of the Six of Cups or are they spiking a cup with a Gypsy love potion?  It's up to the reader to decide - based on the cards around you in a reading.<br />The art is fantastic and reminds me a lot of the supposed Gypsy heritage of Tarot cards, although some people might be put off by that type of imagery.  The colors and symbolism give me a great insight when using this deck to give readings to others.<br />The book is very informative and it's use of the images from the cards enhances it's value to potential users of this deck.<br />But it's not too overpowering for new Tarot readers either, and that's a big plus.  This deck might work well at a carnival or renaissance fair if you want to give it an ideal flavor.  I'd recommend it to anyone interested in Tarot reading, especially if you are interested in Tarot readings for other people, and not just self discovery.	2003-04-14
US	50863276	RFKBP0HS3HW0L	1556345208	671323792	GURPS Alpha Centauri (HC)	Books	4	7	10	N	N	Role Playing in a computer game world	GURPS: Alpha Centauri is the best crossover from a computer game to a Role Playing Game available.<br />About the source material: &quot;Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri&quot; is a computer game that lets you build entire civilizations.  The most original feature of Alpha Centauri is that it takes place after civilization advances to space flight.  In Sid Meier's &quot;Civilization&quot; computer game, one way to win was to be the first to have colonists build a spaceship, leave Earth, and travel into space.  Alpha Centauri follows that band of colonists from their start on the new world to their end, centuries later.  The expansion, Alien Crossfire, adds more factions to the possible colonists, and also adds two alien races wanting to keep the world for themselves.  Although based on his Civilization games, Sid Meier created a fresh way to play colonization computer games with this game.<br />GURPS: Alpha Centauri provides an adaptation of that source material to a role playing game.  Both Alpha Centauri game info and Alien Crossfire expansion info were used to create this worldbook.  Most of the pictures were taken directly from the computer game, although the selection of pictures and the placement of graphics is one of the major reasons this book did not get a perfect five stars from me.<br />Chapter 1, the Prologue, gives people unfamiliar with the game a starting point.  It contains basic info about the world and what happened to the mission.<br />Chapter 2, &quot;Planet&quot;, gives a capsule look at the new world, and includes some of the native life forms and the things these creatures do.  These creatures give players a hint that all is not well on the planet.<br />Chapter 3, &quot;Factions&quot;, provides an in depth look at the various political and social agendas that exist among the colonist's leaders.  This section includes profiles of the faction leaders, along with the stats necessary to use them as non-player characters in campaigns.  You'll have to hunt for pictures of some of the leaders, as they frequently do not appear on the pages that they should be on.  An example: Zakharov's stats are on page 49, but his picture does not appear until page 86.  This book would have been much better with a full page of info about each faction leader and making sure the picture of that leader was on that page.  One of the better features of this section are the adventure seeds given for each faction.<br />Chapter 4, &quot;The Road to Transcendence&quot;, deals with the advances needed to win the computer game translated into gaming terms.  This section is further divided into sub-sections dealing with specific periods of time in the mission.  This nice feature gives potential GM's the ability to sort out what they need for campaigns quickly and easily.  This is the best section to use when deciding when in planet history you want to set your game.<br />Chapter 5, &quot;Colonists&quot;, contains the info you will need to create characters.  Some of these character types are unique to GURPS Alpha Centauri.  In this section are some of the Advantages, Disadvantages, and Skills players will want to give their characters.<br />Chapter 6, &quot;Hardware&quot;, gives stats for weapons, vehicles, and other tools which characters use to fight the dangers of the new world.<br />Chapter 7, &quot;Campaigns&quot;, gives GM's a way to decide what to include from this game world in their own campaigns.<br />Appendix A gives some standard GURPS items and info to convert those items into this setting if possible.  Appendix B allows people who own a copy of the computer game a chance to convert what they know from playing the game into GURPS game stats and terms.  This second appendix will see a lot of use from me.<br />In 128 pages, Steve Jackson Games manages to convert a great deal of the richness and variety of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri into a hardcover role playing game book.  As a GURPS fan and Alpha Centauri player, I was interested inwhat this union would produce.  If anything, I'd say that those who frequently play the computer game will find that this book does not cover all of the various possibilities from the game.  Even the book itself admits this in chapter 7, where it says: &quot;The Alpha Centauri setting is almost too rich for role playing, covering centuries of time and a tremendous range of possible themes&quot;.  Thus this book suffers from being too short.  Much more material could have been added, especially in a hardcover.  Some GM's may wish to purchase the computer game and try it before attempting a campaign set in this worldbook.  This book does a very admirable job at attempting to give people a chance for role playing in the world of Alpha Centauri.  I know I'll use this book.what this union would produce.

This book is a good reference for students of Tarot, especially those that use this deck.<br />This workbook is keyed to a specific deck of cards, the Mythic Tarot deck.  Unfortunately, the Mythic Tarot deck itself seems to be out of print, but students still able to find a copy of that deck will find this workbook a great aid to learning these cards and their meanings.  The Mythic Tarot is keyed to the Greek Gods and uses fairly simple imagery, but with all the symbolism that Tarot students have come to expect from a modern deck.<br />The unusual way presented here to get to know the Major Arcana is a great tool for students that want to try their hand at creating their own decks, but unsure of how to start.  The Major Arcana are illustrated in black and white line drawings, and the workbook encourages you to color them in any manner you see fit.  This is a great way to give your own interpretations to the cards, and a good way to study the cards for self realization.  The workbook also gives you space to write your own observations about the cards.  Immediately after the section on Major Arcana is an exercise which gives students a chance to get to know their key cards for themselves.  Although only two pages, the chance to review what you have learned and utilize it is a nice touch.<br />When studying the Minor Arcana, it can be harder to find something to link to which allows for deeper study.  The Mythic Tarot presents a link between Astrology and the Court Cards that is an interesting one, and the detailed notes you will take while reading this workbook and interpreting these cards will give you your own insight into what these cards mean to you.  This is important later on, when you decide to start giving readings.  There is also a chance to review with an exercise to allow you to get to know the Court cards better.<br />The discovery sections for the other Minor Arcana are just as interesting.  Only a small illustration of each card is given (the one reason you may want to try to find a deck of Mythic Tarot cards in order to use this book).  The space for the notes which ask you to &quot;recall an experience of your own which fits this card's essence&quot; and to &quot;find your own key word or phrase for this card&quot; give students of Tarot a unique way to experience the cards for yourself.  This section concludes with a short exercise designed to allow you to use what you have learned about the Minor Arcana without the accompanying Court cards.<br />Finally, there's the usual section for using the cards in readings.  It starts with a short summary of three layouts - a twenty-one card spread, a fifteen card spread, and a &quot;Gypsy&quot; spread.  There's also longer sections on a &quot;Horoscope&quot; spread, a &quot;Horseshoe&quot; spread, and a &quot;Triangle&quot; spread.  No Celtic Cross spread to be found anywhere.  I found this to be a refreshing change.  Each of the larger sections includes a sample reading.<br />The only thing that kept this workbook form getting a perfect five stars from me was the fact that it was keyed to a specific deck of cards.  Without the Mythic Tarot deck in your hands, this workbook is of less value, but still useful.t to know the Court cards better.<br />The discovery sections for the other Minor Arcana are just as interesting.  Only a small illustration of each card is given (the one reason you may want to try to find a deck of Mythic Tarot cards in order to use this book).  The space for the notes which ask you to &quot;recall an experience of your own which fits this card's essence&quot; and to &quot;find your own key word or phrase for this card&quot; give students of Tarot a unique way to experience the cards for yourself.  This section concludes with a short exercise designed to allow you to use what you have learned about the Minor Arcana without the accompanying Court cards.<br />Finally, there's the usual section for using the cards in readings.  It starts with a short summary of three layouts - a twenty-one card spread, a fifteen card spread, and a &quot;Gypsy&quot; spread.  There's also longer sections on a &quot;Horoscope&quot; spread, a &quot;Horseshoe&quot; spread, and a &quot;Triangle&quot; spread.  No Celtic Cross spread to be found anywhere.  I found this to be a refreshing change.  Each of the larger sections includes a sample reading.  <br />The only thing that kept this workbook form getting a perfect five stars from me was the fact that it was keyed to a specific deck of cards.  Without the Mythic Tarot deck in your hands, this workbook is of less value, but still useful.	2003-04-06

The first main character, Hugh Valleroy, is a \\"gen\\".  Gens are humans that appear perfectly normal, but generate an internal energy field that helps keep them alive.  The second main character, Klyd (pronounced like \\"Clyde\\") Farris, is a Sime.  Sime have tentacles growing out of their arms, some of which they use for manipulation of objects, but, more importantly, some of which they use to drain the energy from Gens.  Simes need this energy to live, but the draining process generally kills the Gen providing the energy.  This is where the similarity to a vampire story ends.  But Klyd is different.  He is a \\"Channel\\" - a Sime that can take energy from a Gen without killing them and transfer it to another Sime that needs it.<br />And it is this interaction between Simes that Channel and Simes that do not, and the Simes and Gens themselves that make these novels popular.  Klyd and Hugh are sent deep into Sime territory to rescue another Gen, who also happens to be the love interest of Hugh.  Hugh makes a few friends among the Simes and Gens that live in Sime territory.  But that doesn't help him deal with the fact that his lover is in a camp of Simes that do not have Channels.  The fact that most Gens in Gen territories do not trust Simes (because all they know is that if they are drained of energy they die), and most Simes would kill a Gen for their energy rather than use the rare Channels makes this story similar to vampire fiction, but different enough to hold your interest through many books.<br />The differences between this and a vampire novel could not be more apparent.  There are no vampires that can transfer the blood they steal to another vampire.  And The Farrises, who run a camp called The House of Zeor, are devoted to making the world a better place by making sure that Gens are safe from marauding Simes who have no channels - some of which do not want channels.<br />It is these differences that make this novel a fascinating start to the Sime-Gen universe.  The sequel, \\"Unto Zeor Forever\\" is an even better novel, but I'd recommend that you begin with this one in order to understand some of the events in the sequel.<br />This book is scheduled for reprinting shortly, and it will be a welcome addition to any SF fan's library.making the world a better place by making sure that Gens are safe from marauding Simes who have no channels - some of which do not want channels.  <br />It is these differences that make this novel a fascinating start to the Sime-Gen universe.

It is very illuminating to see how real people are seen when measuring up to GURPS standards.

These &quot;alternate earths&quot; make a wonderful addition to this book, showing how history could be changed in strange ways by only one person.<br />I'd highly recommend this book to GURPS GM's that have historically based campaigns, and recommend this book to any student of history that might want to try to recreate a historical figure for another campaign.

Don't be put off by the name - this book contains much more than just the millennium bug.<br />Starting with a chapter on Y2K (which we know on 20-20 hindsight never became the calamity that some were predicting), there are ideas in this book for everything from a complete world-wide computer shutdown, to &quot;Mad Max&quot; type worlds, and even the biblical &quot;Judgement Day&quot;, along with several others.  There's also a section on a super-hero world suffering from post-apocalypse blues.<br />The &quot;sidebars&quot; (sections of the book along the sides of each page) contain even more material that can be used to put your game world in a state of chaos.  Some of these sidebars beg to be put into whole worlds of their own.<br />But the book suffers slightly when it reads a little like a collection of articles about post-apocalypse scenarios in gaming, rather than a single world presented in RPG terms.  The =nine= authors each contributed a section or two to this book, and only the excellent effort by Sean Punch to put it all together under one roof keeps this book from being merely a collection of unrelated after Armageddon articles.<br />I'd still recommend this book for people wanting to see what their campaign world would look like after a major catastrophe, or for people wanting to explore what happens after.	2002-11-12

It gives ideas on what might happen on a world that has humans and Kren living together.  The Kren are the snake-like humanoids, and they have a fascinating physiology that comes into play in several areas of this book.<br />Kren can raise venom - they are poisonous, and can bite and kill humans if necessary.  Kren lay eggs.  Kren shed skin - a process that makes them unusually vulnerable during the time that their new skin is curing.<br />It is the story of how the humans and Kren interact that make this story a wonderful read.  Humans are visitors to the Kren's world, and it is unheard of that a Kren should choose a human to be a \\"molt brother\\" - that is, a person who would be trusted to watch over a Kren during the shedding of old skin and the curing of new skin.  This look at an alien civilization from the alien point of view is very refreshing.<br />The only thing that kept me from giving this book a perfect five stars is Lichtenberg's use of reincarnation.  Although it =is= necessary for the story, I have never been a believer in reincarnation, and it detracted slightly from my enjoyment of an otherwise fine read.<br />I'd still recommend this book to SF fans for it's portrayal of a truly alien race from the alien's point of view.  It's unfortunately out-of-print, but can be found in used bookstores inexpensively.  The sequel, \\"City of a Million Legends\\" is also out-of-print, and it's sad that no other books were ever written about this unusual alien race and culture.	2002-11-12

This revised and slightly expanded version of two long sadly out-of-print books (\\"78 Degrees of Wisdom: Major Arcana\\" and \\"78 Degrees of Wisdom: Minor Arcana\\") is a welcome addition to any serious Tarot reader's library.<br />Although I wouldn't normally recommend this book for the Tarot beginner, I'd recommend it highly to serious students of Tarot wanting to know more about the many different meanings of Tarot cards. Some beginners might find Pollack's usages of the definitions of cards to be more than the superficial ones.<br />Going far beyond the \\"This one covers you\\" school, Pollack gives many different ways to interpret the meanings of Tarot cards, both from a spiritual viewpoint (\\"What does this card mean to you?\\") and a metaphysical viewpoint (\\"What does this card mean to the person you're reading for?\\"). It also allows for meditation and self-study of Tarot cards.<br />Although set up like a standard Tarot book, with chapters covering the Major Arcana, the Minor Arcana, and some readings, (including a sample reading or two) Pollack's definitions of the cards goes far beyond the ordinary superficial \\"Death means something in your life is going through a major change - you are about to stop one thing and start doing another.\\" Each card has a picture - many from the Rider-Waite deck that most Tarot card readers start with, but some from other decks that you may not have seen. Each card has numerous definitions - and even some examples of what that card might mean when in certain placements in a Tarot card reading, both regular and reversed.<br />I've no other books in my Tarot library that are more heavily thumbed than my old copies of the two \\"78 Degrees\\" books, and I was very glad that Pollack has found a publisher willing to not only reprint them, but allow her to revise them and include both books in one volume. Highly recommended for serious students of Tarot.	2002-11-12

This additional info on the German Army adds richness to the background promised in GURPS WWII.  \\"Characters\\" gives you everything you need to create German PC's and NPC's for a WWII campaign.

The \\"German Armoury\\" chapter gives GM's a more detailed look at German armament and vehicles.  Almost every weapon and most vehicles used by the Germans is in this section.  \\"Inside the Third Reich\\" looks at socialism, the courts, and life while under the Reich.  There's even a look at the POW camps and concentration camps inside the Third Reich.  In \\"Campaigns\\" there's campaigning info for players and GM's.

And it makes a wonderful starting point.<br />It seems hard to believe that there are only six chapters in this book - but there is quite a lot of detail in these chapters.  Beginning with \\"The World At War\\" this chapter explains the background for a World War Two style campaign.  It covers a lot of world history in a good capsule format that GM's may want to read thoroughly for campaign ideas.  \\"The Combatants\\", gives a comprehensive section on the major players in the war, both on the winning side and the losing side.  \\"Characters\\" gives you everything you need to create player characters and NPC's for a WWII campaign.  The character templates in this section give GM's a quick starting point.  The \\"Armoury\\" chapter gives your characters some weapons to fight with, as well as a basic equipment list.  The \\"Vehicles\\" section adds many cars, trucks, and tanks to your WWII campaign.  In \\"Move Out!\\" there's campaigning info for players and GM's.  There's even some ideas for crossover campaigns and alternate endings for the war.  Finally, for those who may not own the basic rules, the book concludes with a copy of \\"GURPS: Lite\\" - a basic intro to the GURPS RPG for those who may not own the basic book.  This edition of GURPS Lite has been custom tailored for GURPS: World War Two.<br />The 28 pages of detail about the course of the war is not to be missed, and can even be appreciated by non-gamers for its attention to important events in World War Two such as the sinking of the Bismark.  The 20 pages of details on Britain, the US, the Soviets, Germany and Japan give us an inside look at the organization of armies,units and tactics, special ops, and intelligence, although it's easy to see that this could be expanded.  The 23 pages of info on characters is fairly comprehensive and includes 14 sample characters.  The 36 pages of detail on vehicles gives some of the major equipment used in the war, as well as ideas on how to use what you know to create totally new equipment that may not have been covered in this section.  The 16 pages of \\"Move Out\\" even includes info on what might be happening on the home front, as well as what is happening behind enemy lines.  The \\"Basic Training\\" section of GURPS Lite allows GM's that don't have the basic rules to create military and non-military characters and NPC's for this campaign.<br />This book is a great starting place for GM's, and that is probably its only flaw.

The fifth world, \\"Ezcalli\\", has details for a strange Earth where the might of the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans is unsurpassed.  The sixth and final world is the strangest of all.  \\"Gernsback\\" starts with a simple postulation: what if Nikolai Tesla's inventions worked and were used by someone with the financial genius of Morgan?

These statistics give enough information for GM's to give life to totally alien races, some of which the players are bound to have never seen or met before.<br />From the rather friendly and pig-like &quot;An-Phar&quot;, and the benevolent super-powerful &quot;Auroras&quot;, to the energy draining &quot;Gloworms&quot;, and very versatile &quot;Xenomorphs&quot;, GURPS Aliens gives two or three pages for each alien race, each page packed with info like their psychology, their ecology, their culture, their politics, and some ideas for adventure seeds with each race.<br />The book also has a short section at the beginning that has some small details on Alien campaigns, and creating alien races that are not in the book.  This section allows GM's to create new alien races that no one has ever met before.  There are even suggestions for creating races that will not overpower your campaign.<br />GM's unfamiliar with GURPS will find it easy to convert the stats for the alien races to other systems.  Conversion to &quot;D20&quot;, for instance is almost on a one-to-one basis.  GM's running GURPS: Space or other GURPS based campaigns may find the races in this book to be a good addition to their adventures.<br />A great addition to a GURPS library, a fantastic addition to a GURPS &quot;Traveller&quot; campaign, and a good addition to any SF gamemaster's references.

God created the Universe with the aid of a Symphony - sort of like music that then controls things that go on in the world.  Thus by using their own music, Angels, Demons, and even some people, can control parts of the Symphony and turn it to the cause of good - or evil.  I must say, as a music fan, the idea of using music to create and manipulate the world appeals to me.  This music is then used to influence events - from simple events like whether or not you go to the store today, to much more complex events such as a war.  And =both= can cause a ripple effect that can influence the future.<br />With their almost magical powers and miraculous songs, both Angels and Devils can attempt to manipulate the events on Earth - possibly bringing about Armageddon.  But such manipulation can cause a wrong note in the Symphony that can be detected by higher powers.  It is only the efforts of other ArchAngels and ArchDemons that keep Ragnarok from occurring today.  But there's always tomorrow.<br />It's yours to decide - do you want to play a fanatic Angel following the cause of light and good by attempting to keep the Symphony in balance, or do you want to play a fallen angel that is trying to regain their position in Heaven, or do you want to try a Demon that creates havoc wherever they go, or something in between?  There are rules for creating several types of Celestials or Angels, and Infernals or Devils.  You can even play a Corporeal or human, although they have a smaller part to play in this world.<br />It's loads of fun for players - they can try to use their powers and abilities to influence current events in the game world while trying not to cause dissonance - which would attract the attention of their bosses.  And it's a lot of fun for the Game Master - they can look at current events and try to see how those events might have been caused by Angels and Demons fighting on Earth over humans and territory and then try to put that into campaigns.<br />If you want to try this game, be prepared.  Some of the subject matter is very controversial.  Some religious people may find the idea of pretending to be an Angel unusual, and the idea of pretending to be a Demon disturbing.  However, having said this, I'd like to give this game four out of a possible five stars.  I would have given it five had they included more material from the original sources, but interested game masters and players can purchase standard \\"In Nomine\\" books and easily convert that information to GURPS.

US	50863276	R2UO1V31DV2W0Y	155634127X	886969708	GURPS Basic Set	Books	5	34	42	N	N	Before "D20" there was GURPS	GURPS is an unbelievably adaptable set of role-playing game rules.  \\"GURPS: Basic\\" is a book of the core rules which are used by a massive number of other GURPS books.  Whether you want to play modern day intensely realistic spy adventures, wild futuristic space opera, heroic sword and sorcery fantasy, four-color super heroes, tales from the Wild West, or anything in between, GURPS will let you do it.  GURPS features one of the most flexible, open ended character generation systems ever developed.<br />Yet despite its universal adaptability, it's still easy to learn to play and run.  The basics of GURPS can be explained in about 15 minutes.  There's even a \\"GURPS: Lite\\" available =free= online that has an even simpler version of the basic system.  The entire system lets you design and build whatever and whenever and whomever you want.  There are no classes or levels - you create exactly the type of character you want.  You use character points to decide what you want to build.  The only limitation is in how many points you want to spend.<br />GURPS uses only standard six-sided dice that anyone can get almost anywhere.  What's even better, you only need three to play.  You roll three dice to hit - if you roll low, you generally hit, and if you roll high, you generally miss.  What could be simpler?<br />Then, to add to your enjoyment of your new RPG system, GURPS Worldbooks are something that describes a specific universe to adventure in, such as \\"GURPS: Discworld\\" or \\"GURPS: Lensmen\\".  GURPS Sourcebooks are something that helps you build a specific genre, such as \\"GURPS: Old West\\", \\"GURPS: Fantasy\\", or \\"GURPS: Space\\".  There are enough Worldbooks and Sourcebooks for GURPS for anyone to build just about any universe their hearts desire, and, what's even better, you only buy what you need.  Not planning a fantasy adventure?  Then you won't need \\"GURPS: Fantasy\\".  Not adventuring in the Final Frontier?  Don't buy a copy of \\"GURPS: Space\\".  Hate Super Hero campaigns?  Forget the \\"GURPS: Supers\\" book.  But if you do need additional background material, it's there.  Many of the Sourcebooks have a related Worldbook.  For example, the recently released \\"GURPS: Castle Falkenstein\\" already has a world building supplement - \\"GURPS: Castle Falkenstein: The Ottoman Empire\\".  Even more player and game master support is available online thru the \\"Pyramid\\" newsletter - which also covers other gaming systems besides GURPS.<br />Steve Jackson Games continues to licence popular games and worlds for use in their system, including the currently available \\"GURPS: Traveller\\", (based on Marc Miller's original game) which already has many supplements, \\"GURPS: Myth\\" (based on the popular computer game), \\"GURPS: Alpha Centauri\\" (another computer game to RPG conversion), GURPS: Planet Krishna (based on some of L Sprague DeCamp's SF books), \\"GURPS: New Sun\\" (based on Gene Wolfe's SF series), and others are coming.  Older books have covered such diverse material as Philip Jose Farmer's \\"Riverworld\\", and White Wolf's very popular \\"Vampire\\", \\"Werewolf\\", and \\"Mage\\".<br />Other companies are jumping on the bandwagon.  The \\"Powered By GURPS\\" line started with a new game from Steve Jackson Games called \\"Transhuman Space\\".  Eden Studios released a GURPS version of their popular \\"Conspiracy X\\" game.  Amarillo Design Bureau has satisfied one of my dreams by using GURPS for RPG's set in their \\"Star Fleet Battles\\" universe (which basically gives us \\"GURPS: Star Trek\\") and is promising more role-playing supplements for the Final Frontier.<br />Steve Jackson Games currently makes over 150 different supplements for GURPS, and over 70 of those are currently in print, making it one of the most comprehensive sets of rules for role-playing available.  GURPS has my highest recommendation for anyone interested in trying a system that has the flexibility of the new \\"D20\\" rules, and yet has been out longer and has a wider range of possibilities.  I've been playing RPG's and gamemastering for over 20 years and there's no system I've ever been more fond of, and I've used virtually all of them.  Try it.  You will not be disappointed.  GURPS is truly the \\"Generic Universal Role Playing System\\".mastering for over 20 years and there's no system I've ever been more fond of, and I've used virtually all of them.  Try it.

US	50863276	R1R5Y5BZCZP4BO	0738700894	370922017	The Tarot of Oz	Books	4	11	12	N	N	Wonderful art - and usable, too	The Tarot of Oz, a set of all 78 Tarot cards and a small book that helps explain them, has wonderful art, and a booklet that helps new users of this deck interpret readings.  But, as a Tarot card reader myself, and Oz fan for many years, there are at least two places where I think it misses the boat.<br />First the good news.  The deck is wonderfully illustrated with images of the L Frank Baum Oz characters - some of whom many people will be unfamiliar with if they have not read beyond \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\".  There are illustrations from several of Baum's later Oz characters.  The art is very much in keeping with the childlike fairyland of Oz.  Also, after some getting used to these unusual new images, Tarot readers may be able to use these cards to get a fresh interpretation of the various meanings of Tarot cards.  There's also a mini-story that goes along with each of the minor arcana series that can help in further exploration of the hidden meanings of the cards.<br />Dorothy is used to represent Coins (although Sexton calls them, more appropriately in this case, \\"stones\\") - and she is a very good example of someone who would be centered in that suit, with her constant desire to want to return home.  Coins is the suit of Earth.  Many of the images from Sexton's suit of Stones come from Baum's book \\"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\\" in which Dorothy returns to Oz in a most unusual fashion - through the center of the Earth.  A very appropriate choice of story for these cards.<br />The Tin Man is used to represent Cups - and he is an excellent example of someone who has centered his very existence on the Heart, with his never-ending desire to prove that he still has emotions.  Cups is the suit of the Heart.  Many of the images from the suit of Cups come from Baum's book \\"The Tin Woodman of Oz\\" in which Nick (the Tin Woodman) Chopper finally goes in search of his true love.  A very appropriate choice of story for these cards as well.<br />Now the bad news.  There's at least two major mistakes, in my opinion.  Sexton has the Scarecrow representing the suit of Swords and the Lion representing the suit of Wands.  But it's the Scarecrow that is seeking knowledge - and knowledge is a facet of finding illumination, which is best represented by the suit of Wands.  Even more telling, the Scarecrow is afraid of fire.  Does that represent a fear of what might happen if he is revealed to \\"have a brain\\"?  I feel this helps prove he could be better represented by Wands.  On the other suit, the \\"Cowardly\\" Lion is seeking courage - and courage is a facet of fighting.  Fighting and conflict is primarily represented by Swords.  The Lion, therefore, could probably be better represented by Swords.<br />Other than these two mistakes, I'd still recommend purchasing this deck - Oz fans will love the illustrations - especially of the more esoteric characters, and Tarot Card readers, once they get used to the unusual illustrations, may find this deck helpful in readings - especially of children.  4 out of a possible 5 stars - I would have given it a perfect 5 if the Scarecrow had been Wands and the Lion had been Swords.s at least two major mistakes, in my opinion.

But perhaps, just maybe, it's time to look at the stories behind the toys and the men and women that make them.<br />Let's look at one of Philllips' examples.  He goes into great detail about &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; (yes, I know, this cartoon has been off the air for years, but it is a good example of Phillips' writing, and a good example of what to look for in occult influenced children's shows).  He-Man always says: &quot;By the Power of Greyskull - I have the Power!&quot;  But Christians know that only thru Jesus do we have power.  The &quot;Sorceress&quot; has many magical powers always seemingly used for good.  But it is still magic, and magical spells are specifically forbidden by the Bible.  Even the title of the show, &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; implies that these creations are the masters of the universe, when we Christians know that the true Master of the Universe is God.<br />Phillips mentions &quot;Smurfs&quot;, &quot;Gummie Bears&quot;, &quot;Care Bears&quot;, &quot;My Little Pony&quot;, and &quot;Rainbow Brite&quot; as all containing some magic, whether used for good or ill doesn't matter.  It is allowing our children to be exposed to magic and the fact that it &quot;can be used for good&quot;.  Many of today's children's shows are far worse.<br />Many modern toys also have a occult influence - just go down the aisles of any Toy store near you and look at the action figure row - you'll find such things as &quot;Spawn&quot; (go look up the definition of &quot;spawn&quot; in the dictionary) and other even more horrible looking things.<br />Phillips speaks about the subtle ways that children can be influenced by the magic and sorcery that is a great deal of children's programming - and &quot;programming&quot; is a good word for it when it is being used to program our children into being more accepting of magic and the occult.<br />Far more interesting is Phillips' condemnation of our use of the television as an &quot;electronic baby sitter&quot;.  He quotes such sources as The American Academy of Pediatrics to back up his claim that watching televised violence, whether real or fictional, can make children both more violent and more accepting of real-life violence.<br />I urge anyone reading this to pick up a copy of this book and read it with an open mind.<br />BTW, for the last person on the review list, &quot;Pokemon&quot; is definitely occult.  There are references to  &quot;air&quot;, &quot;earth&quot;, &quot;fire&quot;, and &quot;water&quot; powers - all of which are magical spell elements.  Each Pokemon has these powers which they use to get their owners out of a jam.  This encourages using magic to escape from your problems, when we are told to trust in God to help us through our difficulties.  Take a good look at &quot;Pokemon&quot; and compare it to the more &quot;adult&quot; game &quot;Magic - The Gathering&quot; and you will eventually make the discovery, like I did, that Pokemon is just &quot;Magic the Gathering&quot; for smaller kids.<br />The only thing I wish is that Phillips would take the time to update this book.  Many of the children's toys and shows he mentions have been off the air for years.  Many of the replacement shows for kids are far worse than the apparently &quot;cute and cuddly&quot; shows of yesteryear.gic and the occult. <br />Far more interesting is Phillips' condemnation of our use of the television as an &quot;electronic baby sitter&quot;.

A born-again Arab, Kirban uses many examples from the Bible and then explains what they mean to us today.<br />This small, pamphlet sized, book contains over 50 charts that help explain the prophecies of Revelation to the layman - and they're still interesting to the student of Biblical Prophecy as well.  There's also some info from the book of Daniel as well that really helps explain the prophecies of Revelation.  The charts really help bring out the important details of the prophecies concerning the End Times.<br />One of my favorite charts shows the exact boundaries of the land that was &quot;deeded&quot; to Abraham and his descendants by God.  This really helped me understand why Israel considers the land of Palestine to be their property.  It includes the vast majority of modern-day Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Jordan, and stretches over all the way to Kuwait!  Later charts explain the twelve tribes of Israel including who they were and who they became, and many others.<br />If you don't have &quot;Revelation Visualized&quot; by Kirban, then this book is worth finding.	2001-12-23

Included in this volume are over 300 pages of fine details about the coming war in the Middle East and the road we must travel to Armageddon.  It shows why Russia and the powers of the north are interested in Israel's land and resources, the coming of the final Anti-Christ, where Jesus can be found in the Quran (Koran), whether the land being fought over is really Israel's or Palestine's, more about Solomon;s Temple and the third attempt to rebuild it, and many former secrets of the Jews, including the &quot;copper scrolls&quot;.

Many Christians familiar with Grant Jeffrey's or Hal Lindsey's works would find much familiar ground in Kirban's books.  A born-again Arab, Kirban uses many examples from the Bible and then explains what they mean to us today.  Kirban's co-author, Gary Cohen, is a born-again Jew.  This is simply one of Kirban's best efforts.  The entire book of Revelation is explained in both words and charts to create a crystal clear interpretation of the Bible's final book that you will remember forever.  One of my favorite things about this book is that Cohen and Kirban never forget that the Apostle John wrote in the first century AD and did not have a modern reference source to compare to.  This means that the Apostle John had no way of really describing what God was allowing him to see in the far future.  But Kirban and Cohen do - and they take pains to go over every line of Revelation from the King James version, the most widely distributed translation.  Verse by verse, Cohen and Kirban take passages from Revelation and explain them and their relevance to us today.  I believe that it would be hard to find a more thorough dissection of scripture from a totally Christian perspective.  And the viewpoints of Cohen and Kirban shine through so that they speak to all of us - from the Christian, to the Jew, to the Arab, and to everyone.  If you want to really know Revelation, then I can't recommend this book highly enough.	2001-12-23

In &quot;Apocalypse&quot; you can learn about the biblical prophecies concerning America (yes, there are some!) why the early church believed in not only the Rapture, but a pre-tribulation rapture, what the final world church will look like and what it will do, what the &quot;Mark of the Beast&quot; might be and how to avoid it for as long as you can, What happened to the &quot;lost&quot; tribes of Israel (they're not as &quot;lost&quot; as you think!) and what happens if you're &quot;Left Behind&quot;.  A great book for beginners or advanced students of biblical prophecy, this book is recommended if you like any of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books or Jeffrey's other works.	2001-12-23

Until this one.  But Grant Jeffrey wasn't afraid of telling the American public that there are such regulations that can be activated with a single stoke of the President's pen - as we saw vividly demonstrated during the Twin Towers Tragedy.  Why the world will eventually need to switch to electronic currency and what it means to Christians is also discussed, as well as the coming successful attempt to create a national ID card.  Plus this book includes info about the recent discovery of the possible sites of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus' tombs.  The warnings that Jeffrey gives in this book should serve as a &quot;two minute warning&quot; to all born-again Christians.  One of my most highly recommended Jeffrey books.	2001-12-23

Many Christians familiar with Grant Jeffrey or Hal Lindsey would find much familar ground in Kirban's works.  A born-again Arab, Kirban uses many examples from the Bible and then explains what they mean to us today.  &quot;Guide to Survival&quot; mostly concerns Revelation.  Kirban takes us down the road showing the prophecies that tell us how the world will end and in what order.  Yes, there's quite a bit about the Rapture here, and the time just before the Rapture, as well as a lot of material about what remains left undone for those &quot;Left Behind&quot;.  The pictures available in the trade paperback edition help emphasize the warnings that Kirban gives to all of us.  If you like the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books and want to understand how they really can occur, then I can recommend almost no better writer to start with than Salem Kirban.	2001-12-23

Many Christians familiar with Grant Jeffrey's or Hal Lindsey's works would find much familiar ground in Kirban's books.  A born-again Arab, Kirban uses many examples from the Bible and then explains what they mean to us today.  &quot;Questions&quot; is a wonderful book - almost like a &quot;frequently asked questions&quot; pamphlet that deals with Biblical prophecy.  Topics include: The Second Coming, the Tribulation, the Millennium, the New Heavens and New Earth, and many photos and charts that help explain the prophecies of Revelation to even a total novice.  Although small, this pamphlet is packed with good information for anyone wanting to get a handle on Biblical prophecy.	2001-12-23

Many Christians familiar with Grant Jeffrey's or Hal Lindsey's works would find much familiar ground in Kirban's books.  A born-again Arab, Kirban uses many examples from the Bible and then explains what they mean to us today.<br />Although not as good as Kirban's other books - I'd recommend &quot;Guide to Survival&quot; or &quot;Revelation Visualized&quot; for a starter book, &quot;Satan's Mark Exposed&quot; just how easy it will be to transfer from our current cash system to one that is totally computerized and what that will mean to born-again Christians.<br />The ATM cards you now use with the famous magnetic stripe are already being phased out in favor of a computer chip based card.  This book details how easy it would be to transfer to a computer based cash system and how easy it would be then to deny access to your credit cards, your bank account, and even your government benefits - while still keeping you well under the thumb of a no-longer benevolent Uncle Sam.<br />We are already slowly making the transition to this now.  Who among Americans doesn't have at least one &quot;preferred customer&quot; card that allows you to get discounts at the cash register of a big supermarket chain or department store?  Rest assured, Kirban warns us, this will eventually turn into machines that can scan voice print ID, fingerprints (some banks are -already- requiring fingerprints just to cash a check!) and finally the ultimate tool - an electronic implant under the skin that will do all of this and more.  Or perhaps you could go for the non-cosmetic mark - a tattoo on your hand (or forehead) that will do the same thing.<br />Kirban's warnings came long before the similar warnings of Grant Jeffrey and Hal Lindsey, but they're still just as valid (and much closer to reality) than ever.  Good effort from Kirban.  Well worth trying to find in a used book store.	2001-12-23

It contains many interesting tidbits that I found interesting - especially the information about virtually the entire book of Ezekiel being found on stone tablets and how close it is to modern translations.  Also included in this book is a lot of info about the coming third Jewish temple and what it means to both Jews and Christians.  There are many pieces relating to the Second Coming of Christ, the new Jerusalem, and quite a bit about what our life might be like once we reach eternity.  One things for sure - we =won't= just be playing harps and singing hymns.  If you've enjoyed Jeffrey's other books, I highly recommend you consider this one.	2001-12-23

Many Christians familiar with Grant Jeffrey's or Hal Lindsey's works would find much familiar ground in Kirban's books.  A born-again Arab, Kirban uses many examples from the Bible and then explains what they mean to us today.<br />This book explains exactly what happens the moment you die - whether you believe it or not.  Kirban explains what happens from the Born-Again Christian perspecitve.  Starting with why it is necessary for you to die, and continuing through why is is almost too expensive to live but too expensive to die.  There's a good section on the United States and Heaven that presents such unusual facts that it's almost worth the price of the book by itself.  Then it goes into the pressure that is on the nations of the world at the time nearing the Second Coming and what causes that pressure.  This &quot;gathering storm&quot; really makes current world events stand out - and even more so once you realize that this book was written in 1969.<br />The final chapters go into detail on how you can live a thousand years or more by accepting Christ as your Saviour.	2001-12-23

I came into this prequel with a lot of preconceived notions that it would not be a worthy successor to the original.  And it isn't.  But after a second reading, I realized it's not supposed to be.  &quot;House Atreides&quot; is a prequel, not a sequel.  It's supposed to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; of what happened before the greatest book in science fiction history.  NO book can ever hope to live up to that kind of hype.  But I believe Brian and Kevin do a masterful job of setting up things that we =know= are going to happen in later books without killing the suspense.  There's whole new storylines to explore in this series, which they do later on.  So Brian's not Frank.  But he's working from Frank's notes with the aid of an author who is used to working in other people's universes.  If you like &quot;Dune&quot; give this series a chance.

I enjoy all of the &quot;Art of ...&quot; books, despite the high price, so I can try my hand at drawing and painting some material similar to the Disney animators.  However, the text goes into more detail about their journey in China, rather than the real &quot;making of&quot; type text I expect.  That was the only thing that kept me from giving this book five stars.  Art students would love this for a gift...	2001-11-08

It covers quite a bit of the usual subjects, but in a very thorough manner.  Just take a look at some of the subjects from the back cover - the US in prophecy - &quot;New Age&quot; deceptions - Is Russia the &quot;Magog&quot; of the North? - and many others.  There are many unique views in this book, including pictures of the effort to recreate the Levitical priesthood by the Jews - pictures that have never been published in any other book.  I think that those interested in how fast we are really rushing to Armageddon should buy and read this book.	2001-11-08

Not recommended for very young kids, &quot;The Vanishings&quot; only covers about a third of the first book (and thus doesn't do a good job of explaining why these kids were &quot;Left Behind&quot;).
