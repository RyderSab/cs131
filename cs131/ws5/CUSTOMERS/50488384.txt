It is a thin book in a beautiful layout (well I came from a laboratory environment). The text is easy to follow and rich in information. It is an ideal book to come up to speed on the new features of Java 1.5, especially since now you get full 1.5 support in Eclipse. And do not worry about the typos the text, the prose is still clear. Also do not worry about the short treatment of concurrency. It is just a quick start intro and it serves this purpose well.	2005-07-08

I started very enthusiastically to read the book and ended in wading through quite a mess. <br /> <br />The level of the book is intermediate, certainly not advanced. <br /> <br />The topics and treatment in this book are quite mixed in level and style. A little about the language itself (so I learned happily about the existence of labels in Java), a lot about the API (here I appreciated most the dynamic proxy and the reference package discussion) and even an entire chapter on design (which I did not like at all). <br /> <br />If you want to learn a little more about Java and have already read the top notch \\"Effective Java\\", then this book is full of useful suggestions of areas for further exploration. <br />	2005-05-17

This is the best software book I read, since Meilir Page-Jones landmark OO book. It is just an intellectual pleasure and delight to read. Even if you are not interested in Java itself, this book is well worth reading. I have to admit that I was annoyed at James Goslings praise in the book flap. After all he is the inventor of Java and a very smart guy indeed. But after reading this book, I do believe him that he truly needs this book. <br /> <br />This book is one of the handful of books about how TO USE JAVA. It is written in the tradition of Scott Meyers \\"Effective C++\\" and even surpasses this landmark book in quality. It has 57 items of interest organized in ten chapters. Each item can be read alone and the items can be read in any order. Still it is pure delight to read the book from cover to cover. <br /> <br />This book describes the consequences of the interplay of the basic Java concepts with nearly mathematical precision (no formulas). It helps you to write library quality code. It gives you a feeling, where you have to be careful... It increases the quality of your code and your joy of programming. <br />	2005-03-29

If you are interested in the believes of the authors you get more than your share. The believes are not bad. In fact it is easy to agree with the authors at an 80% level. Also one finds some new thoughts. Still reading this book gives oneself a bad feeling.  <br /> <br />Part of the reasons is easy to grasp. Writing three times how bad EJB is, is ok. But this opinion drops out of the entire book. It is much better to spend more of the audiences time with the good solutions and treat them real thoroughly. <br /> <br />A signpost does not have to go the way it is indicating. Still for a book on good Java/Software qualities, it is necessary that the authors also do deliver on true quality. Better Java reads like a layman speaking about Zen Buddhism. You might not have to be a Zen master but without an experience of enlightment/satori it is difficult to meaningfully speak about Zen. <br />	2005-03-29

It contains high density contents organized in lists of items. No fluff just pure knowledge. Right now this is the first book I use to look up the simple Java concepts. I do not have to wade through long texts or examples to find or not to find something. <br /> <br />If you prefer an easier paved or more pedagogical introduction you are probably better of with the books from Cornell, Eckel, van den Linden, which I use if I do not find what I look for in the Winston book. <br /> <br />If you know have a good working knowledge of Java be warned. The content of this book is the basic and only the basic stuff. You might be bored by this book. <br /> <br />If you have a grasp of the basics of the Java language, you should also learn a little about how to properly use Java and pick up a book like Joshua Bloch \\"Effective Java\\". <br />	2005-03-29

You should have a working knowledge of the patterns of the too basic books (\\"Design Patterns\\" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides and \\"Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture\\" by Frank Buschmann, Regine Meunier, Hans Rohnert, Peter Sommerlad, Michael Stal). It is helpful to have the too previous conference books as a reference nearby. Yes and you have to cope with C++ (when did you use it last time) and Smalltalk. <br /> <br />If you are happy with this, you get rewarded by a rich set of ideas and insights. The book just draws you in. This is a conference book by many authors. But due to their shepherd and writers workshop efforts the book nearly reads like being written by one author/author team. The level is excellent. Reading this book is a nice way to spend your time. <br />	2005-03-11

For the data side of XML (Web Services etc. you have to grab a different book, a good one is Newcomer \\"Understanding Web Services\\").  <br /> <br />The reader level is intended from beginner to advance. The beginner should probably start with a good thin book. If the beginner insists to start with this book, it would probably be easier to start with the third chapter (a concrete example) and read the overview chapters one and two at a later time. They simply require too much knowledge. Humans are not very good at the web browsers task to ignore everything they don't understand.  <br />Important concepts are introduced at great leisure. The reader is watching, how things build up during the process of development. So you do not only see the results, but also the process. A great help for your own development. Still this book does not contain very much fluff and page fillers. Harold supplies plenty of thought food and only drowns the reader seldom in the richness of his knowledge. <br /> <br />With respect to schemas document type definitions are treated considerably more extensive than the XML schema language. Other possibilities are mentioned but not treated. <br /> <br />Also the treatment of layouts favors cascading style sheets over XSL formatting objects, which still have only meager support. <br /> <br />The quality of the bookbinding is horrible. The paper is too heavy for the book cover. My book cover only survived me reading the first couple of hundred pages. Also the book is too heavy for the strength of my hands. It is really a pity to give such an excellent book a so poor hardware. <br />	2005-01-17

Each of these chapters is a fast read (maybe half an hour), but contains enough substance to fill an entire book of good quality. <br /> <br />It is always good to remind oneself in regular intervals, of what excellent quality means. This book helps you.  <br /> <br />I read it from the perspective of a software developer. After reading this I now think, that I really do finally understand the importance of use cases (see Ivar Jacobson). Before I was reading a book by Kent Beck on Test Driven Development. Also here the Jenson Book sheds extra illumination. A test is a use of a program. <br /> <br />You might find the book expensive for so few pages.

I do know a total of nearly ten different trainers now, but intensely only two to three. <br /> <br />I read this book during an involuntary break of my exercises due to a flue. Reading helps the mind part of the exercises a lot. I did learn quite a bit in the details of the descriptions of various exercises. I already read this book half a year ago (at that time I was totally addicted to Pilates) and still was surprised about the totally \\"new\\" gems in the book. <br /> <br />The main part of the book is the detailed description of a long sequence of exercises on the mat. It is illustrated with excellent photos. All the goals are stated (the why of this particular exercise) and also important a short list of no-no's.  <br /> <br /> <br />It takes considerably longer to read through the description of a single exercise than actually doing it even ten times. A lot of different things have to be coordinated and watched out for. The list is by far not complete, but an extremely good start and refresher. Obviously mastering an exercise takes a long time. But good results are fast. The complexity keeps your cerebellum active and one does not get bored too quickly. <br /> <br />The claim of getting a new body within a few dozen hours of exercise is a big exaggeration. But I certainly feel different and most importantly better due to Pilates. <br /> <br />The book is clearly worth owning. If you do not have the luck of having trainers you should consider of getting one or more books by other authors to complete your vision.	2004-10-11

The introduction says more about the financial market as many long texts. Also the definitions are precise and do contain content.

It saves literally weeks of work.<br />As a next step a very dense overview of the &quot;standard&quot; finance theory is presented (first order Markov...). The authors even succeed to explain the Black Scholes option-pricing model in a few pages. I am very thankful for this.<br />The main impetus of the authors is to apply complexity theory to financial markets and get in return a good and existing example of a complex system. They look deeply into the limits of the independent and identical distributed probability function assumption. Also higher order correlations, the effect of competing and partly collaborating agents is discussed.<br />The text is accessible to most graduate students with a corresponding background in mathematics, physics ....	2004-06-01

This book even has on its front cover a label telling us it is a &quot;Martin Fowler Signature Book&quot;. This book was a disappointment. In the introduction Fowler claims much less. This book should be merely &quot;useful&quot;. It is much better than that. It is good.<br />So what is the problem? The title is misleading. It is about patterns, but not really about enterprise applications. I am not in the subject of enterprise applications. I never ever have touched a program like SAP or a language like COBOL. But I encountered nearly every problem addressed in the patterns. Even the money class has corresponding problems in other fields: a Voltage has both a value and a unit. Also having complaints about the fact that 3 times 33% are less than 100% are always common.<br />What is this book about? It is basically about problems you have in moderately big applications. How do you connect a relational database with its structure and transactionality to a system, especially an object-oriented system (but not only)? And how do you connect to the user interface, especially a web interface. Also it contains a lot of useful small patterns at the end. As you can see: a lot of valuable stuff for many people. Yes and you get the deep judgments and fine humor of Martin Fowler too.<br />What is the main problem? This book is not really suited for actual reading. It contains an introductory part of a hundred and a reference part of four hundred pages. The introduction part is annoying to read. It is at the same time too simple (Some knowledge of relational databases should be a requirement for this book, and much more...) and too difficult (An extremely lot of forward references to patterns described later in this book). Also a lot ofstuff is in the most trivial sense repeated within a few pages distance only. And it is repeated down to the wording of the individual sentences.<br />The reference part is a lot better. It gets better to read the further along you already read. The number of forward references gets less along the way. I liked especially the last part about base patterns. As their name already says they should have been much more to the beginning of the book.<br />This book contains an excellent book within it, just waiting to be \\"refactored\\" out of this collection of valuable thoughts. I firmly believe that Martin Fowler is well suited to do this refactoring job. I do sincerely hope that he does it for the next edition of the book. Most of the work is already invested and the result would be very valuable for many people. It is possible to write excellent and readable books about patterns as for example Buschmann et al in \\"Pattern Oriented Software Architecture\\" showed.	2004-03-22

I am not a computer scientist but could follow most of the book easily (Well I do have a strong mathematical background.). The book is not very formal, but still based on sound arguments. It has a tremendously wide range of subjects incorporated: both within AI and between disciplines as differently as Philosophy and Operations Research. Nearly every one of them is dealt with at an excellent level. Only the physics parts in the perception and robot chapters are a little mediocre in presentation quality. Anyhow they are pretty much at the end of the book. <br />Also I liked very much the extensive historical overviews. The book contains lots of reading recommendations to explore further fields.

It is eminently practical, well structured (nearly) and quite complete.<br />But don't fool yourself for the deeper topics you have to look somewhere else. Also it always makes me sad to see a book that will probably only be good for less than a couple of years.	2003-04-22

You might want to check out Alan Cooper &quot;About Face&quot;, Johnson &quot;GUI Bloopers&quot; or a similar one which focuses in a broad way specifically on GUIs. If you are interested in Web design you might prefer the excellent &quot;Don't make me thing&quot; from Steve Krug. Even if you want to look at GUI design with a strong graphics bias you might first want to read the beautiful books of Tufte.<br />Having said that and you still make it to this book. You get an excellent treatment of the graphic aspects of design in general and at many places with special applications to GUIs. Examples are posters, maps, public transportation information, different GUIs including the NextStep. If you like Piet Mondrian, the Bauhaus ... then you enjoy the positive examples a lot. The book gives some theoretical background and tries to help build our taste by showing good and bad solutions to design problems. <br />The pictures are well reproduced (mostly black and white) and of good quality. The cover of the book is somewhat horrid (on line order saved me here from not buying it). Also it is extremely soft cover - way too soft for such a valuable book.	2002-08-19

It is delightful to read his books. It deepens your understanding and gives you a feeling of happiness at the same time.<BR>Specifically this book contains the entire source code of an OS (Minix THE predecessor of LINUX). It is complete and thoroughly explained. The source code is in C and sometimes in Assembler. Especially the Assembler parts are hard to grasp. The C code is sometimes very lucid sometimes I simply got lost. So I just stuck to the main text.	2002-08-07

It contains lots of well explained C++ code in the main text.<br />It might be a simple matter of taste. Personally I do not like the writing and the code. It is clear but somewhat uninspired and shallow. But see for yourself.<br />Before reading this book I do highly recommend reading Alan L. Tharp &quot;File Organization and File Processing&quot;. This is a true gem in the computer literature, but you do not find sample code.	2002-08-07

One can read it fluently. It is about a reasonably important subject. The book is well crafted (hardcover, layout...). In short reading it makes you happy and smart.<br />The only disadvantage of it: there is no sample code.

It doesn't get caught in the Software wars and has examples of most existing systems. Another advantage: it is a thin book and not a 1000 pages bible. So you can easily read it in a weekend and then decide where you want to dig deeper (if necessary).	2002-08-05

It took me still two months to read through it. Every sentence is loaded with information. A lot of important statements are stuffed into lists and tables. This gives the book excellent reference qualities and this makes the book quite a hard read, especially after work.<br />The content is relevant, clearly described and trustworthy. It has very little references to alternative views on the subject.<br />I am still looking for a good introductory fat book on software architecture.	2002-07-16

It gives you a nice and concise overview of what changed from VB6 to VB.Net and C#.<BR>The later chapters are still interesting. Anyhow they are more about the classes in the libraries. Here sometimes there is no comparison to VB6 (ADO.Net) and also the differences between VB and C# are marginal only. The overview itself is to the point refreshing and helpful.<BR>To read this book a good familiarity with VB6 or Java is mandatory. Also the author will not teach you any OO or DB basics.	2002-05-29

Don't read it in an intermediate state. Also it is the type of book that is a great enjoyment for people with idle brainpower. To be a successful professional in the computer field it is not necessary. It maybe even misleading. Here you have to manage solid day-to-day work and not feel like an inventor of a new language.<br />Prerequisites for the book are some interest in philosophy and linguistic and a slight remembrance of a few years of college math.<br />It contains lots of small intellectual gems. Complete explanations of a language interpreter and a compiler are more down to earth.	2002-04-29

The author is brilliant and influential. Still I do prefer Bertrand Meyer, Meilir Page Jones and Martin Fowler. They are much clearer and to the point.<br />It is difficult to fairly judge this book. So many of the ideas are now commonplace that it is hard to see the unique points of the author. Clearly the Booch notation is unique. But this notation is now also a problem. It is superseded by UML. It is also difficult to figure out the authors' unique point, because this book is filled with myriads of citations. Some of the cited works I know quite well and strangely enough reading Booches version of their work makes their special appeal disappear.	2002-04-09

You already have to know a lot about software architecture to meaningfully read it.<br />It is very abstract, elegant and bright. The reading style is still amazingly light. If you are in the know you are delighted to read about it in such an elegant way. If you are not in the know you will have trouble to develop a concrete idea and to digest all those different aspects on so few pages.	2002-03-27

It has hundreds of useful ideas. <BR>For usability issues Steve Krugs &quot;Don't make me think&quot; I still consider the best. Johnsons book is a little too thick to be easily read in one go of a few weeks.<BR>Johnson manages it well to write a book which is both good to read and essentially contains a very long list of single issues.<BR>The entrance into the book I found rather steep.

Concise, detailed and highly valuable	I really do like Martin Fowlers books. He is bright, clear, rigorous and relevant. This is his first book and most difficult to grasp book. I started reading it a few years ago and had to give up: it was too abstract for me to grasp. Now with a few more years of OO and pattern experience it shines at me in all its beauty.<BR>This book condenses so much Analysis/Architecture/Modeling knowledge that it is difficult to come up with an idea to tackle the abstraction problem. Examples might help but how many does one need. I guess far too many.<BR>Still I have a wish: Please write a new edition with UML diagrams and sample code in JAVA.<BR>Then I also do have a big wish: I want more of this topic.	2002-03-26

The beginning is rather steep, but the rest of the book a smooth read.

It is usually as easy to read as a cookbook. This book can actually and worthwhile be read from cover to cover. Big achievement!<br />I learned quite a bit from it and found it very well spent time reading it.<br />The authors try to be very systematic. They try to do everything as good as they can. They are of a high quality. They even use extensive peer review at the patterns conference. Still the different sections are of a very diverse quality both in depth and breadth. Sometimes difficult concepts are just dropped on the reader, while fairly trivial stuff is explained over some pages.<br />Anyhow this book is an excellent complementary book to the GoF (Gamma et al.) one.	2002-02-19

He states them clearly and strongly. Sometimes you get even the feeling of being yelled at. Sometimes the descriptions are rather abstract. But and most important of all: His claims have substance and are well worth thinking about. But be prepared of being evangelized of thinking in terms of the user. This book is an organized collection of essays from a single author. <BR>My main wish to the author is: Please write a small version with the essence of your book. Something in the style of the great Steve Krug book &quot;Don't make me think&quot;. <BR>My second biggest wish: Add a table of references. Yes there are some useful references in the book like Edward Tufte &quot;The visual display of quantitative information&quot;, a marvel. I just like them all together at the end.

A truly daunting task. All the examples and specifics are in C. You remember this language after Pascal and before C++, Java, C#? Though the contents is valuable for programming in any language the book would be quite hard to read without some C knowledge. On the other side it is good enough to have a quite faded ten-year-old remembrance of the language. The examples are crystal clear and well explained. This is an absolutely worthwhile book and not only for the nostalgic feelings of times gone by.	2001-12-12

I must say I am impressed both in the rigor and sharpness of the probabilistic reasoning. This book relies heavily on probability theory (especially hidden Markov models) and is clear enough to be read without a sharp pencil.

He is witty, humorous, theoretically rigorous, complete, terse, entertaining, relevant, easy to read, and always anew rewarding. The only disadvantage I can find is that he wrote so few books. <BR>As you can already see in the title the terminology is a little dated. People nowadays would rather use IT instead of DP. Anyhow the contents is as true as it was at the time of writing. Especially refreshing I found this time how he plainly put all those things into their correct and sane perspective again I personally do suffer from during these month. There are reasonable people out there. <BR>So what should I say? If you are in any respect involved in the IT or similar business, pick up this book and enjoy!	2001-12-12

(Though the level of B. Stroustrup's book on C++ is not reached.) Roughly 200 hundred pages are C# specific. The majority of the rest is a description of the .Net class libraries. It is absolutely sufficient for a thorough and enjoyable understanding of C#. .Net itself is so rich that it would require at least a factor of four more pages. This book gives you a nice start on the new world of the .Net concepts though. This book has only one problem it is too heavy in physical weight. Please on the next edition make two volumes of it. In short this book serves well for any developer interested in the subject.	2001-08-27

Then I really got annoyed to read the same things over and over again and at the same time I missed some more in depth explanations. A lot is done with the framework itself. This is probably due to the very early delivery date of the book.

The database examples at the end  are treated only in an extremely thin way.<br />This book is strongly routed  in theory with a keen eye on practical requirements. Even some original  research of the author is first published here. OSM is a true alternative  to the methodologies commonly used. Also the notation shows a true  perspective from outside UML.

It has the heavenly three (D. Chappel, D. Box, K. Brockschmidt) and now this one. It is a good alternative to Don Boxes (Mr. COM) masterpiece. It clearly explains the foundations on a C++ level  and no more. You will have to turn to Brockschmidt for that. I strongly  recommand this book and wish more other subjects would have books on  comparable quality.	2000-04-25

But I really liked reading in it and it caught much more my attention. Thats my personal bonus of one star.<br />Nearly each chapter of this book has a different author. Probably most authors read the headings  of the other chapters, but not the chapters themselves. This makes them  somewhat more selfcontained than in other books but also nothing is really  thoroughly explained. I started with the winsock chapter which is a marvel.  I would never have been reading past the first chapter without it. This  contains a general architectural overview, which would make a good  appendix. It certainly doesn't help you to get startet with this book or  anything else.<br />I enjoyed reading all the different authors viewpoints on  MFC and can recommand this book to anyone wanting a good collection of  articles on it.	2000-04-03

Simple Windows Programs, how to match the brackets in the editor, creating bitmaps, assembler generation of the optimizer, COM, MFC, ATL.... The only thing really missing is an absolute beginners instruction on how to use  this specific compiler to do the C++ excercises. Anyhow VC misses an  important wizard here too. <br />All is explained well and can be grasped with  ease. The author is trustworthy and nobody seriously expects that C++ and  Windows can be truly explained in anything less than many thousand pages  and many, many month accompanying practise.	2000-04-03

Everything is explained from the beginning in a clear and consise way. Anyhow you should have had some exposure to COM and C++ Templates. (Don Box and B. Stroustap will more than do it for you, the great Chappel book won't be enough.) Knowing about  the Win32 API and framework, knowing about the OLE stuff will help in the  later Chapters. It is ok if you have forgotten it all, a previous exposure  to it just helps that all the explanation fall into place.<br />Anyhow after  having some exposure to STL this should be required reading. Just to get an  idea of the power of combining C++ multiple inheritance, templates and  preprocessor makros. I heartfully recommend the book to every mature  software professional.	2000-03-14

It has only a couple chapters on it and doesn't try to explain the accompanying JScript library in it...<br />The rest is about the usual enterprise stuff (in the MS View).  There are quite a few books to that topic, most other ones do roughly as  well.<br />So my wish to a potential author: write about VI and only about VI  and try to do it as well as you can. Don't spend more than 1 or 2 chapters  on other topics. Thanks in advance.	2000-01-11

Yes you must be somewhat familiar with C++  beforehand (casually is enough), otherwise you won't bootstrap into it. But  its worthwhile reading even for non C++ programmers. You do not only learn  what possible and how, but also general programming ideas in a very clear,  terse and practical way. The only comparable book is Bertrand Meyers  &quot;OOSC&quot;, where you learn as a sideeffect Eiffel. So buy it, read  it, recommend it.<br />Yes there is also a negative point:  the binding is  very thin and barely survives the first reading. Bigger letters would be  nice. Also the contents should be spread into at least three different  books so they are more easily read.	1999-12-15

So get an overview, learn about processes and memory management. Don't try on the more advanced topics though. Yes I do recommend this book, there is no good alternative  to this important subject.<br />Another aspect are the practical excercises.  They basically boil down to reading a number in some tool. This number  corresponds to the just read text. For me this wasn't helpful.	1999-12-15
