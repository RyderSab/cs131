As a solitary pagan, marrying a Jew, I was put off by her instance that the marriage is doomed (we have already been together for 22 years) because I am pagan and he is not.  She tells some terrible stories about non pagan officals refusing to officate at handfastings, and then proceeds to talk about the inablity of \\"interfaith\\" marriages from working and that she often will not marry such couples.  One reason I am a pagan is because I abhor intolerance, and here it is.  Well, I guess a fundamentalist is a fundamentalist, not matter who your God or gods.	2004-08-23

Karen Novak's Innocence comes the closest yet.  Shriver's book (an incredible effort) tells the story of the mother of a Columbine-type school murderer.  The intensely troubled relationship between mother and son is at the heart of the book.  At the hear of Novak's book is another relationship, this time father and daughter.  The relationship is just as intense and troubling as in Shriver's book, but in a slightly different way.  It is a long time before we find out how Leslie really feels about her father, that conflict and uncertainty, and the shifting reality as presented in the book, bring together a tragic, but beautiful story of innocence lost.	2004-02-25

One of my first books on serial killers in general (as opposed to books on individual serial killers) was A to Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers, so I didn't know about this book.  But, well, the subject matter is too tantalizing, so I went for it.  Was I glad I did.  The most valuable thing about this book for me were the updates.  We get the Green River Killer update, The Railway Killer, and the Beltway Snipers, to mention only a few.  The format here is interesting, and while I read it from page one all the way straight to the end, with its terrific index, its a reference or a &quot;snack&quot; of infomation, however you wish to use it.  It has a place of honor on my shelf.	2004-02-25

Harold Shaechter is my favorite true crime writer because he chooses such interesting subject matter (Jane Toppan, Ed Gein, Albert Fish, Jesse Pomeroy) and really emerses his readers in the time and place of the murders.  As a Bostonian, I especially appreciates it when he takes on some of out home grown deviants (Toppan and Pomeroy.)  He captures the truth of the case, the whole truth, before they were infamous, during their ajudication and, most importantly, after, their lives in prison.<br />If you are fan of Caleb Carr or Mathew Pearl, I highly recommend this book and Shechter's others.	2004-01-05

I was quite simply blown away by this novel, and I am not often blown away.  First, Shriver's characters are wonderfully realistic, with the exception really of Kevin, they are not all good or all bad.  They are, as life is, far too complicated to be all black or all white.  The debate about which shade of grey each one of us is, is the heart of this novel.<br />The writing is really wonderful.  The descriptions are gripping and bring realistic details to the entire story.  As noted above, all of the characters are at once likeable and unlikeable, sypathetic and unsypathetic.  It is a difficult stance to take throughout the book, but she maintains it.<br />The plot is terrific, and even when I was sure I knew what would happen, I was still quite shocked at the shocking parts.  Its a nice thriller on top of its literary quality.<br />Finally, Shrivers questioning of motherhood, and the unrelenting nightmare of giving birth to a psychopath, are timely and sensative.  She speaks the truth, the hard truth, the ugly truth, but this truth is beautiful because it IS the truth.	2003-06-17

I read one on her first beauty books, \\"Blue Eyeshadow Should Be Illegal\\" about 20 years ago and was hooked.  I spend [a small amount of money]...on my skin care routine.  I have avoided what most women my age have done: spent far too much money on make up.  When I want to play, I take her book to the drug store and go crazy for [a small amount of money]....<br />As for the criticisms, I think it is important not to take anyone's word as gospel.  We really don't need ANY gurus.  So, if you use a product that you like and works for you, just because she doesn't like it is no reason to a.) discount everything else she says, and/or b.) give up using a product you like and works for you.<br />I should note that one of the things Paula includes in her ratings is the inflated claims vs. the reality of products.  There are some good products out there that spoil themselves over too much hype and outrageous claims.  Of course, the outrageous claims are required for a heavy price tag -- I am heading back to the drug store!!<br />Finally, I have used Paula's make up and skin care products and find them to be very good.  How are they different?  Well, no outrageous claims, reasonalble prices, and good, basic stuff.  No shine (for the over 35 crowd, this is important!) and no fragrance.  I still use other products, but Paula does provide good options.  That, after all is the point of the book, options and knowing what they are.  A well informed consumer is the best defense against advertising.  And a good defense against advertising really does protect your pocketbook.	2003-02-13

Yes, this book is very dense and technical, I am not a musician and was a bit lost at times, however, the author structures the book in such a way that you can skim or skip what is over your head (a lot for me) and still get something out of this book.<br />For me, one of the most important and rare things about this book is the way the author does not fall into the John vs. Paul biases like so many others who have written on this topic.  He gives both men the written ananlysis and technical break down of their work they deserve and does not short change Paul in favor of John.  This is appreciated as I believe it gives the best description of how the songwriting evolved through the talents of both men.<br />He also gives the same critical analysis of George Harrison's songs, this is rare indeed.<br />For these reasons I highly recommend the book for serious Beatle fans.<br />I am already burning through the second book.	2002-12-10

I really enjoyed this book... I do think you can go overboard using culture to PREDICT the future (1991 being roughly equivilant to 1931), but looking back on it as history, it fits.  I do not think it is any coincidence that we got all the evil child, and childlike things during the time of the heated abortion debate in this country.  Or that vampires have come more to the front in the age of AIDS.  But just as I would be mistaken to say we are now headed into a depression because of all the 30's style clothes I see in the stores in NYC right now, you can't make some of the furture pridictions he makes.  We may look back in 70 years and say, hey, look what the fashions predicted, but not now.<br />At any rate, for the cultural evolution of our monsters and a beautiful and loving (?) tribute to Tod Browning, this book is worth its weight in gold.<br />I especially loved the plastic surgery discussion, and the photos of plastic surgery-man himself, Michael Jackson.	2002-04-02

I agree that Merricat is a wonderful narrator and while I was on to the family secret early in the book, I was never quite sure until near the end of the book.  So, the horror comes from inside Merricat, and therefore, the readers.  It is also a wonderful look at how a &quot;neighborhood haunted house&quot; got that way--the murders, the reculse, her sister (or her sister's ghost?), and Uncle Julian.  After a tragedy, they are never seen, only talked about in the village.<br />Jackson's style is clean and clear, all the more to chill you with my dear.	2002-02-20

I was glad I did.  The book is NOT science fiction (as the cover states) but is a wonderful and dark fantasy.<br />Steven King, in Danse Macbre, notes that this book is a universal childhood fantasy book.  I would qualify this just a bit, it is a &quot;boys&quot; childhood fantasy, and may be universal for boys.  This distance from my personal experience(I'm a woman) didn't harm the book in the least.  The themes are universal, so, while it may not strike and &quot;I know that!&quot; chord, it sure does ring true.<br />Not the scariest, or spookiest, but full of wonderful images and tense moments.	2002-01-14

I find her advice and reveiws to be on the money 99.9% of the time (I have very dry skin, so sometimes I need more moisture in my products than Paula recommends.)  However, I NEVER go shopping without carrying this book with me.  Be warned, sales women at the cosmetics counters will treat you badly if they see it, so either be discreet, if you need their help, or pay no attention to them and just ask for what you want.<br />The only thing that would make this book better, is if it were available on as a searchable CD-ROM.

I have read quite a bit about Jack the Ripper, the Black Dalia, and Lizzie Borden and this book really gives great possible solutions with very good points.  I appreciated the way they put all the evidence and theories on the table and went throught them one by one.<br />As for the Ramseys, I don't think we will ever know the truth, one way or another, like so many cases in this book.  I think that Douglas' take is as valid as any.  Do I think the Ramseys made mistakes AFTER the murder, absolutely, but that doesn't mean they did or didn't do it.  I like the fact that the authors noted the mysterious death of another little girl at about the same time.  No publicity for that little girl.<br />But, I don't want to get bogged down in the case that Douglas was involved in (Ramseys), the rest of the book is spectacular, thought provoking and terrifying in the way that some of these cases have gone unsolved (esp. the Zodiac.)<br />All in all a great true crime read.	2002-01-03

I actual continue to see the last scene in my mind, over and over.  That is the mark of a good ending.<br />Are there problems with the book?  Yes.  Some of the situations seem dated, and maybe not as shocking to me if I had read it in high school.  BUT, the way she used the frame of the book to tell three separate stories which do tie together at the end was very good and allowed for a different kind of character development.  We see the main characters change as they see events next door.<br />I read this book right after Shirley Jackson's masterpiece of haunted house books, The Haunting of Hill House.  While Jackson's book is better, I think Siddons holds up well in comparison.  I especially liked the idea of a MODERN haunted house.  Nice touch.<br />All and all a good, if not difficult, read.	2002-01-03

I bought it thinking of it as a reference, but ending up reading it cover to cover.  There are many stories that run through the book, John, Paul, George, and Ringo's lives, for sure, but you can also follow the legal cases (I never knew Apple records sued Apple Computers, and got an undisclosed settlement!), the tours, the press bickering and the love fests in the press.<br />I found the organization exceptional.  While an index would have been nice (maybe for future editions), I didn't really need it.  My favorite activity while reading this book was to follow various threads from entry to entry.  So, when John wrote a letter to Melody Maker, that is noted and you are directed to the subsequent dates to find out the response, etc.  I found this to be fun and engaging.  All in all, a wonderful book.	2001-06-05

I am a big Caleb Carr fan, with a positive bend to sci-fi, so I found this book to be quite interesting.<br />He shows his prowess as a historian more than a novelist, I think.  His view of the future is very obviously based on his understanding of the past.  This makes for interesting intellectual questions: the nature of reality, what is the Internet doing to our sense of reality, the good old days weren't always so good, etc.<br />Unfortunately, it was simply not as engaging a story, because I think the characters were not as engaging.  Larissa, as bold and uncompromising as she is, is no Sara Howard (from The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness).<br />So, I would say it is a good read, but one you will find yourself able to put down.  Frankly, reading on my commute to work was perfect.	2001-03-27

I was quite excited to find out about Schechter's new book (thanks Amazon!).  I actually became interested in true crime after the Columbine shootings, and have been reading about children who kill.  From Mary Bell to the Liverpool boys who killed a toddler, to the Florida kids who killed the local bully, this subject has been endlessly facinating to me.  Ok, so maybe it is a bit gruesome too.  But I will say that with this book, Schechter hits the nail on the head.  Children who kill other children have been with us for a long time, and we continue to give the same lame excuses: the media (for Jesse that was dime novels, for our recent murders its the movies and video games that are blamed), single mothers, and just plain evil.<br />This book does not answer the question of why, but we get a glimpse into the mind of one of these child killers.  It is quite chilling.  Schechter's research is awesome and his writing style is engaging and his message is clear (and frightening) the next fiend could be living next door, playing in the sandbox!<br />If this book and subject matter are of interest to you, I also highly recommend Cries Unheard: Why Children Kill; The Story of Mary Bell.	2001-01-09

First off,  Mr. Carr's use of an alternative narrator, Stevie Taggart, was brilliant,  in a word.  It give the book so much more texture to see now familiar  characters through the eyes of this servant &quot;boy&quot;.  How rich and  fullfilling.<br />As noted in my review of the Alienist, Sara Howard is one of  my favaorite literary chararcters, and in this book she really steps into  her own.  I also appreciated seeing Elizabeth Cady Stanton as well as  Clarance Darrow.  Carr's enlivened pen brings these murky, historical  characters into full breathing life.  No mean feat!<br />Finally, as a true  crime hound with a particular interest in serial and female killers, this  book goes right to the heart of these crimes and endeavors to answer some  fairly unanswerable questions.<br />Thought provoking and funny, with enough  action to keep you reading, this is more than a worthy sequel to the  Alienist.<br />PS:  For Mr. Carr, if he's reading, how about another one with  Sara Howard as narrator?!!	2000-09-13

I was such a huge fan some 20+ years ago, but I had come to accept the line that Paul's music w/o the  Beatles and even w/i the Beatles was silly and light weight.  I just  thought of it as my guilty little pleasure.  This book completely changed  my image of the man and his music.<br />First, I am not bothered by the minor  factual errors sightee by others here.  Maybe in my more ferverant fan days  I would have been.<br />Second, it provides a real insight into his music.  I  always assumed the medlies on his solo albums were a way of recording  unfinished songs.  But, in the book he talks about making tape loops (and  using them on Tomorrow Never Knows) and how he likes to put together very  different bits of music and string them together as a whole unit.  This  knowlege has given me a great deal more appreciation of his solo work (and  has lead me to replace the old LPs with CDs with zeal!)<br />Paul has fallen  under John's long shadow.  Too bad.  I don't think even John would  appriciate that.  He was a great artist and genius and no saint, but the  same can be said of Paul.

US	53028874	R1M6G5B48QAC6I	0312956045	755090146	Cannibal Killers	Books	4	9	9	N	Y	Very well put together	I disagree with the negative reviews (except about the &quot;harrowing&quot; pictures promise on the cover being bogus, but that is not the author's fault.)<br />I found her discussion of cannibalism in  general to be interesting and enlightening.  The psychology is not boring,  but engaging.  True, if you want in depth on each killer's story, this is  not the book for you (it is only about 300 pages), but as an overview, it  rules.  Also, I love her(?) [Moira] theory on the origins of vampires and  werewolves.	1999-07-02

He puts Fish, that nut, in a historical context.  We get to know a lot about the times (late 20's, early 30's) as well as this quite rightly named deranged  man.<br />Bloch was right, pple are into Ed Gien because they haven't heard  about A.

I am new to Gein, never heard of him before I started cruising amazon.com's true crime books.  I really enjoyed the style of the book, its design, and the pop culture review at the end.  I rented as many of the  movies as are available and appreciate the new eye I have been given with  which to see them.  Facinating!	1999-06-08
