The author touches on many of the common themes found in self-help books on Simplicity (turn off the tv, really listen to your kids, be present in the moment, get out of debt). But her reflection on those themes are very surface and generic. <br />What sets this book apart from other books about this topic is her choice to only \\"buy the best\\" (she spends $500 on a purse that is supposed to last her 20 years or so) and her advice on hiring out all of the mundane, time consuming parts of life. She has a person who runs her errands for her, a house keeper, lawn guy, reading tutor for her kids....and the list goes on and on. I agree, the help is nice. But you have to make a lot of money to support that payroll. She is very career driven, and drives home the point that in order for her to put her family first, career second, she HAS to spend all of this money for extra help. Well, to spend a lot of money, you have to make a lot of money. Unless your family is making quite a bit of cash, you will find yourself feeling like you just wasted your time with this book. <br />May I suggest Mitten Strings From God, or any of the Elaine St. James books instead of Ms. Rocks self-help book. Because in my opinion, Organizing the Good Life really only applies to a small sector of the American public, and regardless, rings flat and dull upon reading it.	2003-02-19

I love it because of its simplicity. This book is divided into sections, and each section is subdivided into ages. So, for example, there is a section on Language Development, and then you can refer to a specific age (15-18 mo., 18-22 mo, 22-24 mo... all of the way to three years old). Other sections would be Learning, Social Emotional, Fine Motor, and Gross Motor.<br />This book is vivid, colorful and a quick read. There are charts that are big and easy to navigate, and then chapters for more explicit information.It really reads like a magazine. This book has suggestions for activities to do to facilitate toddler development and a great list of toys that are beneficial to the age. I used it whenever I wanted to see what my daughter was doing and as an idea book for games or activities to play with her.	2002-10-17

The simple clear illustations and short passages (about 5 words per page) are great for teaching colors, the concepts of slow and fast and day and night.

I wanted to explore the rich Missouri setting, the strong characters that are authentic and interesting, and the issues of racisim and child abuse that rage through this novel like the river that floods Graceanne's home town. <br />In a nutshell, Graceanne is a spirited highly intelligent child who is the sole recipient of her mother's violent abuse. She remains strong, witty and true to herself throughout the entire novel. I strongly disagree with a fellow reviewer who believes that Graceanne &quot;got what she deserved&quot; because she was such a willful and devilish child. I believe her antics, such as hiding out in the school's flooded basement for two days so that she could be &quot;Champion for Eternity&quot; in a game of hide-and-seek, was her way of not letting the abuse do her in. It was her way of preserving her soul.<br />At first I was really worried that the child-abuse scenes would be too vivid. I worried that they would be the central imagery of the story. They aren't. Whitney uses them just enough, and is detailed just enough, so that you know how sick the mother really is. The author often makes you laugh and smile at a small town childhood, and small town kids getting into small town mischief. <br />This is really a story of kids overcoming the hands that life has delt them. Charlie overcoming his club foot, Graceanne her abuse and Wanda the racism that plagued that era of American history. These kids perservere with such charm and such thoughtfulness. In the end you are cheering for them, and praying that happiness will follow them beyond the wire hanger beatings of their childhood.  <br />This is a book that sticks with you. Read it.	2002-05-17

I think it ruined the book. And if you are a Colorado reader reading this for Gov. Owen's \\"book club\\", this book is worth a read in spite of the ending. All of us Colorado folks will be asking the same question...why did the good Governor choose THIS book? <br />This is a book that is rich with setting. Hamill paints a post- WWII Brooklyn, filled with tenements, ethnic code and spunky kids playing stickball in crowded streets. He paints pictures of bored priests at mass, snowy city avenues, and a lonely rabbi in a run-down synagogue. Hamill also addresses prejudice in such a genuine manner. Religious prejudice (Catholic v. Jew as well as Nazi v. Jew), Racial prejudice (black v. white in the baseball world) and some economic prejudice are scattered throughout this book as the main character, young Michael Devlin, tries to make sense of a cruel and hate-filled world. <br />In Snow in August Young Devlin witnesses the near death beating of a local Jewish merchant by an Irish-American gang member. And in this event he has to examine many issues. He has to determine why the Jews who live in his neighborhood are so despised. He then sees a connections with how many whites in America despise Jackie Robinson for being the first black baseball player, and young Devlin is bothered by the hatred that seems to pepper his world. <br />Because Devlin refuses to buy into the anti-semetic notions, he befriends the lonely rabbi. Because of this, he becomes a target of the gang member that beat the Jewish merchent, and the boy has to figure out how to keep himself and his mother safe from their violence. And that is where the story fizzles...because the ending is so out of step with the rest of the novel. The book moves from thought provoking to cartoonish in a single chapter. I keep asking myself, \\"What symbolism is happening here that I am not getting?\\" but I can't figure it out. <br />It is worth a read,but be ready to say, \\"Huh?\\" when you get to the end.	2002-05-15

Basically Gary Paulson devotes each chapter to one of several dogs that played an important role in his life. An animal lover to the hilt, Paulsen will introduce you to dogs that protected him, hunted with him, played with him and just hung out with him on his ranch. <br />Each story is tender and gives the reader glimpses into Paulsen's childhood (riddled with alcoholism and neglect)as well as his adulthood (filled with dogs, horses and a person or two!) <br />Written at a sixth grade reading level, this book would be a great read-aloud at bedtime for kids six and up. Both kids and adults will want to get up and hug the family dog goodnight once they finish a single chapter in this gem of a book. What a find!	2002-05-06

It is no nonsense and to the point. The author basically has the following message: If you want to lose weight and lose it fast, eat only lean protein, complex carbs and vegies. No sugar, no fat, no white flour. You don't get &quot;cheat days&quot;. You either eat right and lose weight, or you don't. The choice is yours, but the information in the book is so complete that you WANT to follow the 7 week plan simply because it makes sense. <br />This book is absent of pep talks, which I personally found refreshing. It is full of information on how you body processes different food to effectively burn fat. He is not pushing pricy GMC products (unlike his Body For Life cohort) and does not have any cheesy before and after pictures of people who have finished the program. I found this book appealing because it spoke to my intelligence. I want to eat this way because I understand how the food will work for me. Ultimately, my eating habits will change for good thanks to these logical explanations.	2002-03-02

You are a better person than me. In this book she asks people to give up dairy, most meat, caffeine, sugar and to combine foods every time you eat. So, if you eat melon, never eat anything with it. But if you eat chicken, then you had better have a grapefruit too. I found the overall makeover really demanding. I could never follow it to the letter. <br />BUT, Marilu does have some good points on why foods like dairy, sugar and meat are really pretty bad for you. I liked her ideas, and have modified my diet because of some of her ideas. I feel better and more energetic, as she promised. And she also asks you to address your health makeover one step at a time. I think that is realistic.<br />This easy read is good information to have if you are looking for a way to eat healthy. But don't read it and follow it to the letter. It is way too demanding, and I think some of her ideas are medically uninformed. So, balance this book with another book on eating well.	2002-03-02

I am really glad that I experienced the book, as well as the ideas proposed within. However, I found the book requiring a diligent focus, like reading my college history textbook. If my mind wandered, I would miss key information that led to greater understanding of the era and the characters. Not loving this genre, my mind wandered, a lot, but I always refocused and reread. <br />There are times when the book reads like a chapter in a Danish History text, but then, there are times it reads like a novel. There is a plot, and the character development is strong. The physician is a martyr of sorts, but a believable one. The queen is strong and is out to prove that she has a brain in an era where women, even queens, were simply mindless props. And the poor king! Bad guys are abound in this book. <br />Yes, this book is a bit sexy too. Lots of naughty parts, but tastefully done. As is the inside of the jacket...look at what the queen is holding in her hand! Oh! <br />If you love this genre, this book is for you. If you have to read this book for book club, it may feel a bit like a forced march, but you will learn a lot.	2002-02-11

It is almost as if she is creating Clara and Laura as well. All women are simple perfectionists, leading ordinary and seemingly plain lives. <br />But in the end only one of the three women are truly successful in living. By enduring hours of plainess, sadness or lonliness that we all find in each day, one woman is smart enough to seize the micromoments of joy, and make life incredible enough to live. <br />Which one?

She talks about her personal connection with her horse, but does not give direct ideas or example on how to achieve this yourself.  She addresses intuition a great deal, and how she has used this in working with her horses as well as her human clients. <br /> Linda dives into the history and mythology of the horse, as well as Junge and his connection with dreams and horses.

By the end, she strikes me as unbalanced and  lonely. <br />If you read this book, do not take it as the only way the Mormon  culture lives. Even though there are unique aspects to the LDS community,  there is a great deal of beauty, morality and love too. Take a step away  from the propaganda (this book) and check out the LDS church from a  different angle. Tolerence is a good thing.	2000-08-09

I read it over and over, even though both of my dogs are still sharing my life with me. It forges in me a deeper appreciation of my two dogs, andt  helps me not be afraid of their passing.  Cynthia Rylant's masterful imagination paints a picture of the heaven I  want to go to...with big fields, a multi-racial God and fluffy clouds with  dog-angels. This is a must read for any dog lover, or for anyone who has  lost a dog. A great gift to show someone you understand and care.	2000-06-05
