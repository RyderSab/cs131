This is the first book I've read by this author, and I found it to be well worth reading.  I was sucked into the world of the novel in the first page, and it didn't let up till the ending.  The characters are engaging, except for the villain, who is horrific.  Give it a try--especially if you like the Richard Stark novels of Donald Westlake--I think you  might like No Country for Old Men.	2005-08-22

I'm unfamiliar with the series books by this author, but I'm finding Ask A Dead Man to be pretty rough going.  I've had to put it down and read 2 or 3 other books since starting it.  The writing reminds me of Nelson DeMille, who provided an enthusiastic blurb.  I only read one of DeMille's books, and found it equally hard to get into.  I know he's very popular, though, so I assume that some people can't get enough of him.  If you are one of those people, you might like this book, too. <br /> <br />For me, it's too much tell and not enough show.  The female characters ring particularly false to me.  All of the women are beautiful, striking, once-beautiful, or faded beauties.  All of the men are daring and handsome, except the villains.  At over 400 pages, this one is too much like work.	2005-06-09

I've seen so many reviews of this book, and seen the author on the News Hour, and was really geared up to have my socks knocked off.  The book is engaging.  I enjoyed Harry's inner life and was especially taken with his descriptions of working as a neurosurgeon.  I was as bored as several other posters with the squash game section.  People (including the author) keep calling this a  9/11 novel.  It does include ruminations on 9/11 and the affects on people's thoughts and activities that radiated out from the event.  Of far more interest to me were the characterizations of Harry and his family.  Overall, well worth reading.	2005-04-25

Hedwig and Berti are German Jews fleeing the Holocaust.  Gerda is their prodigy pianist daughter.  Hedwig is the defining force of the Kessler family, but Berti and Gerda have their share of the story, as they are dragged from London to New York to Kansas by Hedwig.

Laura Waterman was married for many years to a man who shared her love for climbing, sustainable living, writing, and nature.  Her husband, Guy, was outwardly gregarious, charming, and lively.  This book is the story of their marriage, their life of subsistence farming on a homestead with no running water or electricity, and finally Guy's struggles with depression, which ended with his suicide. <br /> <br />Laura and Guy were truly partners in their subsistence living endeavor.  Both were hard working and idealistic, but Guy was the planner while Laura was the steady worker. <br /> <br />While it's obvious from reading the book that Laura truly loved and respected her husband, it's also obvious that his last years were often painful and sad. <br /> <br />Where most memoirs of depression are written by a person who has struggled with or overcome depression, this memoir focuses on the life of the partner of a depressed person.

Scanning through the customer reviews, I found that some people hated the book for its density and others didn't like the character development of one of the African-American males in the book.  I'll cop to being a white female, and admit I didn't see any problem with the treatment of Black Africans or African-Americans.  I think people who did have misread or misunderstood the magical-realist nature of the book.   <br /> <br />Michael Gruber seems far too accomplished a novelist to be writing his first book here, and he is.  In fact, Michael Gruber is the ghost-writer for the Robert K. Tannenbaum legal thrillers.  And they're fun to read, too. <br /> <br />When I finished this one, I immediately bought his next book (lucky me--I didn't find out about the Gruber books till he already had two out and one on the way).  Now that I've read it (Valley of Bones), I'm eagerly awaiting the young adult novel Witch's Boy.  <br /> <br />Buy it--read it--enjoy!	2005-02-21

I don't know how the elves in Amazon work, but a while back this book popped up on the screen as a \\"recommended\\" book for me.  Those elves know what they're doing.   <br /> <br />I started with Gruber's first book (aside from the 16 Tannenbaum novels he ghost-wrote) Tropic of Night.  Loved it. Turned around and bought this one the next day.  Loved it,too. <br /> <br />Gruber does several things that make his books great fun to read.  First, he writes a good story.  Second, he includes an interesting backstory, with lots of things to learn about.  Finally, he provides us with some characters to care about. And all the way through, he tosses off bits of intriguing information and poetry and literature.  All of these things he wraps in a believable magical realism that makes you think, \\"what if?\\" <br /> <br />Recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-02-21

Although, it is certainly mysterious.  After finishing reading it, I'm still not certain what really happened.  And I think that's what distinguishes it somewhat from the mystery genre.  This is not a tightly tied up investigation of a crime.  It is the story of a man's life as told from multiple viewpoints.  There is a murder mystery inset into the story, which is The Hamilton Case.  But there are other mysteries as well: how did Sam & Claudia's baby brother die? how did Claudia's baby die? why did Jaya marry Claudia? how much can we trust Sam's version of events? how much can we trust Shivanathan's version? At points I thought I knew the answers, but now I'm not at all sure.   <br /> <br />Overall, the book is an interesting immersion into life in colonial Ceylon, mostly through the eyes of one man.	2005-01-06

While in Japan, he is befriended by the family's gardener, who introduces him to an intriguing friend. <br /> <br />The book takes place prior to the Second World War, and Stephen is worried about the Japanese assaults on his country--particularly the siege on Nanking.  He is also worrying about family problems.  Despite the background problems, Stephen becomes involved in his life in Japan.   <br /> <br />Interesting elements include the treatment of lepers, Sino-Japanese relations, painting and gardening.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-01-03

Not by Terry Pratchett, or at least not in my book (or in any of his).  This is not my favorite, but it was fun to read and quick.  It's true there's nothing as funny in it as sapient pearwood luggage, but the general story is amusing, and I enjoyed the characters. <br /> <br />Lord Vetinari sets a scoundrel the task of reopening the Ankh Morpork postal service, and much treachery ensues.  Lots of golems in this one. This book is sort of a take-off on corporate corruption, and it's fun to see how Lord Vetinari handles the problem. Recommended.	2005-01-03

I've read a couple of Austen books, but am not a great Austen fan.  After reading JABC, I may just have to go back and read more.  I enjoyed the stories and the characters.

The structure is not very tightly woven, but the characters are endearing and the suspense is well-maintained.  I enjoyed the main character, Rachel (a witch).  Her vampire roommate Ivy and the family of pixies in the garden are also skillfully drawn.  I can forgive a little sloppiness in plotting if the writer can create characters to care about.

It sounded like a fun book to read.  I enjoyed &quot;Bridget Jones Diary&quot; and &quot;The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing&quot; and other chic-lit type books, so I thought I'd probably enjoy a chic-lit vampire book.  <br />&quot;Undead and Unwed&quot; was fun, but it was a little more of a standard romance than I was bargaining for.  Since Charlaine Harris only gets around to writing a book or two a year, it's probably worth reading if you're a big Sookie Stackhouse fan.  If you haven't read them yet, I would recommend the Charlaine Harris' books as being more tightly written with better characterization.  Christopher Moore's &quot;Bloodsucking Fiends&quot; is another favorite in the humorous, female vampire vein.	2004-06-17

The protagonist this time around is Henry Fitzroy's young &quot;ward&quot; Tony.  Tony has become a production assistant on a cheaply-made television series about a vampire.  He soon notices that the special effects lady is more special than usual, and that strange and sinister deaths are taking place on the set of the show.  With a little help from Fitzroy and the special effects &quot;Wizard&quot;, Tony sets out to save the world.  This book is enjoyable and well-plotted, but lacks the zing of the &quot;Blood&quot; series.	2004-06-17

Since Deadwood is a real place, and since both the book and the television series are based on the real place, many of the characters are common to both.  They do not, however, have much more in common besides their names and some shared historic events.  Pete Dexter is a fine writer, and in Deadwood he has written a particularly fine novel.  Much of the novel centers on the relationship between Wild Bill and his friend Charlie Utter.  Other characters whose stories are explored include Charlie's friend, the soft-brained, Bottle Fiend, Wild Bill's widow Agnes Lake, Sheriff Seth Bullock and his partner Sol Star, a beautiful and tragic Chinese singer and prostitute named China Doll, and the always surprising Calamity Jane.  Well worth reading, whether or not you like Deadwood, the TV series.	2004-06-17

This fourth book in Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse series is just as much fun as the first three.  In this outing, Sookie finds herself babysitting a master vampire with amnesia, fighting rogue witches, and being courted by a Shifter.  So, what else is new?<br />Harris writes very satisfying mysteries, and her occult mystery series shows her background.  The book moves along at a good pace,it's tightly plotted, and the characters are well-written and well-rounded.  There are similarities with the Laurell K. Hamilton books, but I enjoy the Sookie books more.  Hamilton has a tendency (particularly in the more recent books) to pile on excess information in the first few hundred pages, then wind it all up in the last few pages--as though she were a student writing a 500 page term paper who ran out of steam, time, and space in the last 50 pages.  Harris is a more controlled writer, and her books are consequently much more readable and enjoyable.<br />Recommended.	2004-05-13

Daniel is an obsessive compulsive and a mathematical savant.  He is completely benign, and even describes himself that way, albeit deprecatingly.    Daniel describes his days and the challenges of life for someone who can't step off curbs or allow the lights in his apartment to be switched such that the total number of watts lit at any time differ.    He describes his adventures, which include falling in love three times, winning a contest two times, and learning to love someone enough to overcome some of his obsessions.    Altogether, this is a charming narrative with memorable characters.  I will add just a few words on the format.  I like that the book is thin.  Lots of books aren't really any longer than this one, but the publishers/printers make them look longer by putting fewer words on the pages and using thicker paper.  This one is not deceptive--it's a quick read, but the boks is as long as it needs to be.	2003-10-17

The beloved character has grown stilted with age.  The dialog in this outing was frequently wooden, the plot could have been lifted from several of the last 10 novels, and this series seems to me to have lost its spark.  There seems to have been more of an attempt to round out the character of Roger.  St. Germain's love interest was more interesting than usual.  Still, somehow it all just refused to gel.  Once again, St. Germain is heroically driven from his home by encroaching bad guys (this time during the Spanish Civil War by Franco's minions.)  Once again, St. Germain is followed by an evil assassin.  And, once again, St. Germain's love interest is menaced by the bad guys.  In a sub-plot, immigrant farmers are menaced by xenophobes wearing sheets. <br />I think in the future, if I get a hankering to spend some time with St. Germain, I'll go back and read one of the earlier, more heartfelt books.  If you have yet to read Hotel Transylvania, Path of the Eclipse, Roman Blood, Out of the House of Life, The Palace, or Tempting Fate---by all means read any of those before this one.  Many of the later novels are worth reading, once you've become well and truly hooked, but these last few have had a whiff of doldrums about them.	2003-10-15

It's up to Thursday to save the world, get her husband back, and learn to leap into literature. That being said, I don't think the plot makes much difference, it's the ride not the destination when you're with Thursday.

This is the first book in the series, in which Precious Romatswe sets up her detective agency in Botswana.  I enjoyed reading about her life, and her cases, and felt I'd visited a sunny and pleasant place, while reading this mystery.  If you enjoy Agatha Christie and other cozy-type mysteries, and you enjoy learning about unfamiliar cultures, try it out.	2003-04-07

I did enjoy the book, although--as the<BR>mother of 4 young adults, some of the writing was a little<BR>too real for enjoyment, for me. It's not that I was overly<BR>shocked by the sexuality, though that is abundant. It was<BR>more that I've read enough teen writing to recognize much of<br />Gloeckner's \\"diary\\" style as painfully authentic.<br />I would recommend this book as a good way to sample Phoebe<BR>Gloeckner's writing, but personally I prefer graphic<BR>novels written from more adult perspebtives. ...I<BR>have not read other works by Phoebe Gloeckner, so I can't<BR>compare this.<br />\\"Diary of a Teenage Girl\\" is part graphic<BR>novel, part illustrated novel.

Here's a chance to finally find out what happened to Mouse, and to catch up on Easy, Feather, Jesus, and Bonnie.  6 Easy Pieces is not as engaging as the earlier books in the Easy Rawlings series; there is not the sense of place and time conveyed in those novels.  Still, you won't be sorry you read this book, if you're a fan of Easy Rawlings.	2003-03-19

In Roe's last outing, A Fool and His Honey, an abrupt death near the end of the book brings the reader up short.  We are not used to having sympathetic, continuing characters die in mystery fiction.<BR>But, of course, life is like that.<br />In this outing, the mystery situation is pretty farfetched, but Harris makes it enjoyable, by bringing us along as Roe Teagarden re-enters her life following the death of her beloved husband.<br />A fast, fun read, but not the best of the series.  Still--worth your time.	2003-03-19

She doesn't like getting old.  She sometimes finds her retirement boring.  And, she just never seems to find the right man to spend her time with.<br />The pretty boy new curate is murdered very early in the book, and Agatha spends the remaining chapters trying to clear the name of her good friend Mrs. Bloxby's husband.  Everyone in Carsely thinks the Vicar done it, because the curate was more popular.  <br />Once again, Agatha is sleuthing with her neighbor, the mystery writer, and once again the two of them are constantly sending each other missed signals.<br />Agatha may never find romantic happiness, but she's a good friend, and a terrific fundraiser.  If she ever learns to recognize contentedness, it may be the end of her detecting.  Lucky for us, she remains obtuse.	2003-03-19

The first 5 or 6 books were engaging, exciting, and fun to read.  Now we still get to see St. Germain, and in this outing, we even get to visit with Olivia in Roma, but the tone is consistently depressive.<br />As always, the historical details are of interest and presumably impeccably researched.  Some of the changes Yarbro keeps ringing, however, are just getting to be tiresome.  How long can we keep hearing Roger and Germain referring to each other as &quot;old friend&quot;, without really seeing any evidence that they are really &quot;friends&quot;.  Yes, Roger is always concerned for Germain's needs, but neither character ever really discusses their concerns with the other.  One reveiwer remarked that centuries of butlerhood must be getting old for Roger, and I would have to agree.  It also becomes increasingly difficult to see why Germain wants to continue his extended existence.  In the earlier books, he was much livelier, but in the last several, it's been just one depressing century after another.<br />Finally, a word or two specifically about this book.  What is with the stigmata?  They seem to be there as just a plot device.  For all his concern over his albino, stigmatic love, Germain never really concerns himself with WHY her hands are always bleeding.  Is she really a Saint?  Does this mean that there is a God, and he is into manifestations of sainthood?  Is she nuts?  A self-mutilator?  We are led to believe that she is a true innocent, whose palms have been bleeding off and on (but mostly on) since childhood, but no rationale is so much as suggested.  And, finally, how about some guidance in pronouncing her name (Gynethe Mehaut)?<br />OK, OK, so I still would recommend reading this book, especially if you've read all the rest, but please---CQY, try to recall the vivid, heroic, undead gentleman from the firstfew books, and let the old boy have some fun!	2003-01-14

This one is poised to be a breakout book for Block, and he certainly deserves to be widely read.

I started to read her books with Real Murders, the first Aurora Teagarden mystery.  I enjoyed the surprising changes the characters went through as that series continued.  Next, Ms. Harris began writing the Lily Bard series of mysteries (they all have the word Shakespeare in the title), and once again, I enjoyed the mysteries, the characters, and the interesting way the series grew.  Now Charlaine Harris has begun writing vampire mysteries, and the fun has really begun.  What's not to like about Sookie Stackhouse?  She's cute, she's funny, and she has a definite mind of her own.  Then there's her boyfriend Bill the Vampire, her boss Sam the shapeshifter, and a small Louisiana town full of Bon Temps regulars to keep things interesting.  I can't wait for the next book in the series to come out.  <br />Charlaine Harris writes mysteries with a strong romantic undercurrent.  She creates characters with realistic motivations and reactions.  She doesn't follow a stale set of mystery writing rules, like always killing off the least likeable character, or keeping the detective character unchanged.  Sometimes her choices as a writer will take your breath away, but that's what keeps her writing fresh and interesting.<br />Several reviewers mention Laurell K. Hamilton, and there are traces of Anita Blake's world here, but I don't expect to see Sookie packing knives and guns, nor are Charlaine Harris's books quite as \\"free-form\\" in their writing style as Hamilton's sometimes are.  There is more humor and less gore.  In some ways, they remind me more of Tanya Huff's series of vampire detective books, and if you liked both of those series, you'll probably enjoy the Sookie Stackhouse books.	2002-04-19

Since the St. Germain books range through time from ancient Egypt to the outbreak of World War II, it is understandable that Yarbro has some difficulty in creating narrative tension concerning St.Germain, when she writes about his life during an earlier period of history.  Nevertheless, there is less narrative tension here than in many of the books in the series.  It is true, as mentioned in the review printed with this book, that Yarbro does not ascribe to historical persons 21st century attitudes.  It is also true that this can be a weakness, as well as a strength, in her work.  It can become tiresome to read about female characters with no scope for change in their lives, or people, such as Csimenae (the female vampire character in this book), who are incapable of learning or experiencing emotional growth and intellectual change.  Even St. Germain and his relationship with Roger can<BR>sometimes become just so much rote behavioral habit.  Come Twilight made me long for the passion and fire and narrative drive of the earlier books in the series, such as Roman Blood, Path of the Eclipse, and Tempting Fate.<br />Since we know that St. Germain will survive into the 20th century, the narrative drive has to come largely through the supporting characters in the novels. The supporting characters in this particular novel, however, were just not sufficiently compelling to make me care about their survival.	2002-04-12
