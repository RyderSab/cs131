I understand that this book was written in the late seventies, but still, trying to rationalize one of the central rituals of the Mende culture, the forced, surgical removal of the clitoris of teen and pre-teen girls as a  pre-requisite of their entering the adult community, is horrifying.  Did  the author perhaps get too much sun as she was doing her field work for her  Ph.d from Yale in this community?  How can she not condemn this aspect of  female life in Sierra Leone's tribal communities, and seem to condone,or  ignore, this most extraordinarily monstrous practice around which the whole  society is organized.  Perhaps the book is an interesting study of  standards of feminine beauty in in a west african community, but to me, as  a woman, I just couldn't get past the fact that this miserable ritual is at  the heart of their society.  The book is well written and full of  interesting and exotic information, and is worth reading if only to raise  your blood pressure, be you male or female, as to the sorry state of women  in the world even in this, the year 2000.	2000-06-19

Her descriptions of the circumstances and characters are colorful and tragic,  and yet full of unexpected humor.  She describes her fight to retain her  dignity and gain dignity for young mothers in prison by founding an  in-prison day care center so that inmates may remain connected, in a  positive way, with their young children.  I would recommend this book to  anyone interested in the justice system, the prison world, or women's  rights.	2000-04-04

The  defendant sabatoges not only his case, his attorneys,his family, and the  judge, but himself as well. The results, as here, are catastrophic.

As a native New Yorker, one of the things I enjoy most about his books is his intimate and accurate descriptions of NY  neighborhoods, travel, food, accents, and attitudes.  He really nails it.

The authors give a chilling and factual account of themis-steps involved in seeking justice for a murderer of two youngacting students in the late sixties and early seventies in NYC. After being convicted for the first crime he is released from prison after 7 years, only to kill again less than 2 years later.  After serving only part of his sentence for the second crime another technical error is poised to set him free again on parole. He is unaware of this and commits suicide in his cell.  The authors paint a detailed and involving portrait of this psychotic serial killer, as well as the courts, the police officials, and the D.A.'s office.  Issues of the insanity defense, the Miranda warning, the legalities of a valid confession, and the general atmosphere of the NYC justice system, are all raised in a thought provoking manner. Although written much earlier, this book is an excellent companion to Judge Harold Rothwax' book, &quot;Guilty&quot;, in which he discusses the same issues and their deleterious effect on truth and justice in the courts.	1999-10-22

Betty allowed herself to become 100% a wife and mother. This would have been a good plan if her husband had been faithful. She had invested in no personal resources besides the traditional roles. When Dan  betrayed her with a younger version of herself she had no psychological  resources at all with which to re-invent herself. In effect, he murdered  her by forcing her out of the family and continuing on with his life, same  as usual, with Betty's replacement. No wonder she became crazy. Too bad she  couldn't have been stronger and more resourceful to survive this egregious  circumstance. If she were stronger she would have kept the kids, ruined his  reputation, and taken him for every last cent he had. Too bad she loved him  so much.  I hate to say he deserved it, but destroying his faithful wife's  self esteem is a reckless path.  I feel sorry for everyone in the family,  especially Betty and her children.  Another good book on the subject,  Loretta Schwartz-Noble's &quot;Forsaking All Others&quot;.  She admits that  she emphasizes Betty's point of view, but it does add depth to her  predicament. It's out of print on Amazon, but I got it last week from my  local public library.	1999-10-11

The hero/antihero, lawyer Jan Schlictmann, is larger than life. His good qualities, as well as his flaws, are magnified.  I have also fought with a  large chemical company regarding injury and employee benefits.  They are as  coldhearted and bottom-line as it is possible to be.  It doesn't surprise  me that they also operated with no conscience at all. But since they are so  rich, they have bought the politicians, and are relatively immune from the  just consequences of their immoral and amoral behavior. Only when the  world's population wakes up and puts on the appropriate pressure will the  large international corporations do what's right. Thank God for the  Schlictmanns and their associates who are willing to risk self destruction  in this important work.

Blind Eye by James Stewart represents the best of the non-fiction crime genre.  The story is well organized, richly detailed, given place and perspective, and as much insight as possible when dealing with a subject  such as Dr. Michael Swango who is a compulsive and random poisoner.  <br />A  person such as Swango has to be everybody's worst nightmare.  Intelligent,  charming, sociable, urbane, well read, professionally credentialed, and in  the grip of a compulsion so horrific that I'm sure even he could not begin  to explain it.  It's just a horrible abberation of the human personality. A  rare one, thankfully, but not unheard of.  Marie Willey, Jeffrey Dahmer,  Ms. Buenoano, Velma Barfield, Genine Jones, to name a few that have had  books written about them. They would all feel very much at home with Dr.  Swango's story. One of the horrors is that we only know about these because  they've been caught. Surely there are many others out there who are never  caught. Where are the psychiatric researchers?  <br />This is the same  syndrome as the random and serial rapist, serial strangler, serial  firesetter, etc.  These people are overwhelmed by an obsession or a  compulsion that must be obeyed, no matter what happens.  They cannot be  given freedom because they simply do not become normal.  I think that Dr.  Swango is really a soul in terrible pain and at some level, some part of  him has been trying for decades to notify the world as to what he is  feeling and how he deals with it.  But who would believe it?  It's so  outside of ordinary experience that it is no wonder there were so many who  doubted, and probably still doubt, that such a nice guy could do this kind  of thing. <br />The only answer for the safety of the community at large is  for Swango and others, if they are caught, must be permanently confined and  kept away from the tools of their respective trades, even in prison.  They  are really not in control of what they do and must be carefully  supervised.<br />Thanks for a great book Mr. Stewart. Very well done. Perhaps  such consciousness raising will be of some help to all of us.	1999-09-28

At first I thought that the short reports were simply too short, but as I got in the rhythm of the book I thoroughly enjoyed the scope of  the undertaking.  This book is especially interesting for anyone who has  lived in NJ for a while as the localities, newspapers, reporters,  attorneys, and facts of the crimes all seem surprisingly, and sometimes  chilllingly, familiar.  Also, the author offers information on books and  newspaper articles for those who might want more detailed information on  each crime described.

Wambaugh's book about the main line murders of Susan Reinert and her two young  children was a great story, but this book is the truth! As usual,  non-fiction trumps even good storytelling. The writing is sophisticated,  and Mr. C. is clearly the finest example of what a criminal defense lawyer  should aspire to be. Thank God he persisted, freed Jay Smith, and in the  process got Pennsylvania law changed so that defendants in death penalty  cases who are convicted due to perjury and prosecutorial misconduct, are  freed without retrial.

The best kept secret about Spence, the &quot;aw shucks, just a  country lawyer&quot; guy on the talk shows, is that he shares with the  reader his delightful skills as a storyteller, and his worldy wise  observations on the weighty issues of the day.

Cries Unheard is a useful addition to the literature of child abuse and its consequences, but it fails to really penetrate the mind of the child who murdered another child.  I understand that this is an extremely  difficult task, but this was the implicit promise of the book, and it  failed to deliver.  The author blames the act on the young perpetrator's  traumatic childhood, but the woman herself, now in her forties, doesn't  understand, nor can she effectively explain, what brought her to the point  of murder.       We are left with the author's certainty that child abuse  caused Mary Bell to murder.  But we don't have Mary herself subscribing to  this theory. In this respect the book was unsatisfying as an analysis of  this rare type of crime.        It's doesn't seem right somehow that Mary's  mother, and her two husbands, as well as herself, and the author, have  profited for thirty years from the notariety of this tragedy.         Instead of trying to ferret out the original cause of this crime, which  seems impossible to do, perhaps the author should have focused more on the  strange and symbiotic relationship between mother and daughter.	1999-05-31

I forgot to mention in my review of &quot;Mean Justice&quot;, that Roger Parloff's book, &quot;Triple Jeopardy&quot; (Amazon.com has it), is another hair raiser on the same subject of prosecutorial misconduct. It's also  brilliant and more than worth  the cost or trip to the library to read it.	1999-05-19

Oh, all you snobby amateur reviewers, lamenting the name dropping and lack of character development ! Get real !  You loved it as much as I did. Who doesn't love gossip - especially from a fairly reliable source?  Dunne's  take on the trial is that of a real insider. What could be better for those  seeking another layer of depth in the telling of this endlessly fascinating  American tragedy.  Read it ! You won't put it down !	1999-05-09

Mr. Graham really possesses a gutsy candor and honesty which is both intriguing and unsettling.  Even though many of the situations, conversations,  and characters presented in his book seem one dimensional  and stereotypical, there is something there that lingers in my mind.  The  gestalt has the ring of truth which hits home, (and I'm not even african  american !).  Insidious racism in genteel surroundings is somehow even  scarier than the in your face brand.  Keep up the good work Mr. Graham, we  need to know what's going on.	1999-04-30

Roger Parloff's &quot;Triple Jeopardy&quot; should be required reading for any American interested in our system of justice.  It should be included in the curriculum of all law schools.  And any trial attorney who isn't  familiar with this case is at a great disadvantage.  By far, one of the  best books on modern American criminal justice. And anyone who is still  convinced, after reading the Knapp case, that the death penalty is  justified, should just read this book once more !  Beautifully written.   Brilliantly analyzed .  A real treasure.  Take a chance and read it.  You  will not regret it.	1999-04-19
US	52019885	R32DHQZSO97CZF	0312960956	28742674	A Father's Rage (St. Martin's True Crime Library)	Books	3	4	5	N	N	An Attempt At Fairness	&quot;A Father's Rage&quot;, by Don Davis is a good try at an even handed telling of an explosive true tale of child abuse, dysfunctional families, drug abuse, and explosive violence.  While the defense paints the father's  murder of the Binghams as justified vengeance, the prosecution calls it  cold blooded murder, pure and simple, with some speed induced paranoia as  an additional element.  Pre-trial publicity is widespread and the  controversy is heated.     The author covers the events in a detailed and  conscientious manner, and the trial is wonderful true-life drama.  All in  all, a very adequate telling of a true story of our time.	1999-04-07

The Senior Editor, Charles Spicer, advises the reader in the intro that, &quot;Each month we offer you a fascinating account of the latest, most sensational  crime that has captured the nation's attention.&quot;  I believe that herin  lies the problem.  A rush to publication,  long before  more mature  insights emerge and a full complement of knowledgable participants are able  or willing to speak, combine to form a shallow , dry, and one-sided  depiction of events. Ken Englade's, &quot;Everybody's Best Friend&quot;, is  a perfect example.  We never get to know anybody.  The murderer's family  and family background are virtually absent from the narrative.  There is  absolutely no insight into the victim.  Purported dialogue is so hackneyed  and stilted as to be a joke - totally divorced from actual conversational  speech.   Psychological insight into motive and behavior do not exist here.  And where is the viewpoint of the defense attorneys?  There is a note at  the end of the book that they declined to be interviewed.  Perhaps they  were not approached in the right manner.  Their view is sorely missed.  I  can understand why the D.A.,(Bruce Castor), in his reader's comment quoted  elsewhere in this column, is so pleased with the book.  It's HIS book!   Maybe because he was so frustrated at being unable to actually try the case  and reap the inevitable notoriety, he was willing to reveal to us, in such  excruciating detail, the machinations of his case.  In any event, these  problems exemplify what happens when a complex, almost biblical tale of  greed, lust, and murder, jumps straight from the tabloids, (the author  actually counts newspaper paragraphs!),  to the non-book format.  Such a  frustrating disappointment!  Hopefully, in years to come, a more  sophisticated re-telling of events will emerge, perhaps via a Tommy  Thompson, Joseph Wambaught, or Jerry Bledsoe.  I will be waiting.	1999-03-24

My Dark Places describes his coming of age after, at age 10, his mother is murdered. His subsequent life with his father is an  extrordinary disappointment. And his turn to petty crime and drug abuse  almost finishes him.  Yet he pulls himself out to become a successful  novelist, and later to journey back in time to try to find his mother's  killer.  What he is really searching for is not his mother's murderer, but  his mother.  He seems to need her now even more than when he was a boy.    The pain is raw and the anger is vivid.  I understand to some extent his  desperate attempt to regain what was unjustly denied him by tragic  circumstance.  My mother is lost to me via Alzheimers disease.  Although  she is physically here, she is really as gone as Ellroy's mother.  It's  just agonizing  to try to recapture what is gone. Full of regret and anger,  confusion and frustration. I really hope Ellroy comes to terms eventually  with his loss.  The book is probably a good try in this direction.  For any  reader who is hoping for that illusive, imaginary balm of  &quot;closure&quot;, (a word which Ellroy rightly disparages)  this book  illustrates that the concept simply does not exist.  The pain is always  there. A tough read, but a memorable one.	1999-03-21

I was pleasantly captured by Det. Fuhrman's reporting on the Martha Moxley murder in,&quot;Murder in Greenwich&quot;. Although he will probably never attain the stature of an Ann Rule or Tommy Thompson in terms of elegant  style or psychological insight, his perspective as a homocide detective  brings fresh eyes to the genre. I especially enjoyed his crime scene  sketches, and his lists.  I felt as if I were looking into a detective's  notebook, and loved it!  He is meticulous and serious and never deviates  from the investigator's point of view.  It is a fresh take in approaching  crime reporting, and originally executed.  I would love to see him tackle,  in the same style, (don't get too slick, Mark), cases such as Jon Benet  Ramsey, or Lizzie Borden.  Why not?  Keep it up Mark, there's an audience  out there.	1999-03-03

The plot has some interesting turns, but ends with a whimper. As I was reading I wondered if this is the same author I remembered from &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, and &quot;Radical  Chic&quot;.  Evidently not.  A grand disappointment, but the writing is  nevertheless grand.	1999-03-03
