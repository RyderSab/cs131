The pair of killers are just too unconvincing, with personal details that seem included more for their novelty than as a natural outgrowth of their personalities (and this includes a truly repulsive sex act early in the novel).

The novel is fast-paced and expertly evokes the era, though readers unfamiliar with the times might have a little trouble with some of the slang expressions.  Like his The Asphalt Jungle, this became the template for numerous subsequent imitations, including the films The Long Good Friday and Scarface.	2003-01-30

Though it contains some interesting ideas, such as waging a media campaign against the terrorists and the inclusion of radical Jews among the terrorists, the writing is not as good as it could be, and one feels that he could have developed the ideas a bit more.  I was expecting something along the lines of Frederick Forsythe or Alistair MacLean, but this novel doesn't reach those heights.  A better-written, if less ambitious, treatment of the same topic can be seen in Thomas (Silence of the Lambs) Harris' Black Sunday.	2003-01-30
US	35449670	R1UBBWPRYJTHFB	0451202473	91466535	Bones	Books	5	3	3	N	N	impressive debut	Other reviews have praised Burke's grasp of forensic details, but I think what really distinguishes her writing is her fine grasp of psychological detail-- there is hardly a false note in its 420 pages.  Events follow logically from characters' motivations, which is not to say that the novel is without its small pleasures and surprises (not to mention a few big ones near the end), it's just that the story doesn't have to jump through hoops or pull rabbits out of a hat to blindside the reader.  The serial killer is intelligent and cunning without seeming to have superhuman powers, and is all the more believable and chilling for it.  Anyone unfamiliar with this novel should know that Burke takes her time to develop her story; in lesser hands, this would be a fatal flaw, but her sheer confidence in her story-- and her characters-- is able to overcome this.  Of the dozens, maybe hundreds, of crime novels I read every year, there is usually only one or two which really stand out.  This is one of those novels.	2003-01-24

The interplay between the investigating officers was not realistic at all, and the parade of suspects muddies the waters to no good effect.  The officers also seemed to have a surprising lack of insight into the workings of the criminal mind, an unforgiveable sin in these days of psychological profiling.  The serial killer is a sympathetic character, but we get little insight into his background and motivations.	2003-01-19

The plot, such as it is, has to do with Fortean phenomena (people vanishing into thin air, strange animal behavior, yadayadayada) which is somehow related to Man messing with the Environment.  It all ends in a fuzzy feel-good New Age pep rally involving dolphins and flutes.  If you want to read a (somewhat) better novel on this theme, check out Wilson Tucker's Ice and Iron.

He is also very candid about his doubts and shortcomings; otherwise, he would have come off as just too pompous.  The cynic in me wants to think that his methods could be outwitted by a good mimic or computer program, but he's worked out his methodology pretty well-- one can easily see him as a cast member of C.S.I.

On the debit side, this one succumbs to the Fallacy of the Talking Killer as I believe Roger Ebert refers to this plot device; in other words, rather than killing his pursuer and making his escape, the villain stays to explain his entire scheme and methodology so that the hero/heroine has a chance to fight back.  The killer is also a Master of Disguises and Escapes (They're all quite skilled at this, aren't they?  Is there a school or something that teaches this?), and there is a character whose racist and sexist thoughts are pretty repugnant (you just know he's going to die a horrible death, don't you?).

Despite the somewhat interesting nature of the experiment and the inclusion of gypsy culture, this seemed a curiously bland novel.  The bulk of it takes place in the '70s, but I got little sense of the time period, and the references to movies and songs of the time seemed forced.  The action scenes were a bit cliched (since one of the characters is a stuntwoman in the movies, I would have thought this would have come more into play).  I think the novel could have used a little trimming, too, as for me it did not get going until the last hundred pages or so.  And I question whether any scientist of the World War II era would have had the knowledge or equipment to have performed the experiment described in the book.  The ending was also weak and unsatisfying; it also takes place in 1986-- couldn't he have taken it another fifteen years into the future?  Overall, a C-.	2002-12-30

My quibbles: 1) some of the entries, e.g., Lizzie Borden, are too brief to do their subjects justice; 2) though there is a general bibliography, one really has no way of knowing what sources she used for individual cases, which would be helpful for the controversial ones; 3) some of her facts are wrong, e.g., she repeatedly refers to Elizabeth Bathory as Elizabeth Bathroy; 4) there are occasional stupid errors, e.g., &quot;had their fingers pulled off with hot pinschers&quot; (pg. 15); 5) the writing is sometimes awkward, e.g. &quot;[the police] were lucky enough to come by some great DNA samples.&quot; (pg. 118).

By the end of the third chapter, this book gave me a chill that not even Stephen King could achieve.  Unfortunately, that was the high point.  My problems with the novel: 1) Coben occasionally undercuts the seriousness of the situation with sarcasm, and some of his metaphors get in the way (there's a boxing analogy during one key confrontation that goes on too long); 2) Some of the characters (the FBI agents, Eric Wu) are a little too broadly drawn, and seem almost cartoonish; 3)Some of the characters have epiphanies at just the right moment to save their skins (Beck taking his dog for a walk, Elizabeth at the airport); 4)there is a bit too much coincidence, and everything fits together too neatly, like a small jigsaw puzzle; and finally 5) the very last revelation at the end seemed to negate some of what came before, i.e., if it were true, why did Beck do some of the things he did?  I know part of the reason I didn't like this novel is me-- I like my fiction very dark (Thompson, Vachss, Sjowall and Wahloo), but the problem also lies with much mystery fiction today-- it's the equivalent of a three card monte dealer, relying more on fooling the reader than it does in being grounded in real-life psychology.  As clever as this novel is, I only give it a passing grade.	2002-12-17

To the dedicated SF fan, much of this material is very familiar, as he covers a lot of well-known books and top authors in the field (I suspect there may be some hidden treasures yet to be discovered, but that's just my supposition).  I haven't read much SF lately, and I was familiar with many of the books he reviews and rates.  I would also quibble with the fact that this guide is arranged alphabetically by book title, making it somewhat difficult to gauge the worth of a particular author as a whole (and the path of his/her career) without going back and forth between the main text and the author index.  Still, it is a handy and well-informed guide for the genre.	2002-12-13

It lacked suspense, was too unbelievable, and wallowed in gut-churning violence.  The psychiatrist, Dr. Frank Clevenger, is given too much time and power by the police to help solve the hostage crisis, especially considering that psychopath Trevor Lucas has already mutilated one person and is likely to endanger the lives of the other people he has hostage (including a pregnant woman).  Clevenger is a hard person to sympathize with, what with his drug addiction and penchant for call girls (I also found it unbelievable that he could function very well while on heroin, and that no one-- not even police officers-- could recognize his condition).  Not only that, Clevenger's success in tracking down Lucas' brother relied too much on luck and coincidence, and the ending was too neat and tidy, especially given the intelligence and volatile nature of Lucas, and the depth and complexity of his problems.

I don't really care for the way he has divided the book up into sections (The American Mystery, The English Mystery, The Thriller, The Police Procedural), as it makes it a bit annoying trying to look up an author you're unfamiliar with (the dust jacket says there are further sub-divisions, even though there are not-- a last-minute revision?).

US	35449670	R39KZQUL93E6DK	0451409396	146839939	Savage Art	Books	3	3	5	N	N	so-so first effort	There are dozens of serial killer novels out there, and this one is no better or worse than most of them.  Once again, the killer has the escape skills of Houdini combined with the disguise skills of Lon Chaney.  The psychology is especially weak, as we never really get into the head of the psychopath, leaving him a shadowy figure at best.  Some of the situations seem a little too contrived to be totally believable, the FBI profiler's bitterness seems to overwhelm the rest of her personality, and the ending seems especially forced so as to result in the classic (now cliched) mano a mano showdown.	2002-12-06
US	35449670	R8AZR0FHTE19E	0821742450	443276122	Night Stalker	Books	2	31	39	N	N	as generic as the title	Night Stalker is just one of the zillion books revolving around a woman being harassed and attacked by a mysterious stranger.  However, the victim is maddeningly passive and complacent about her own safety, to the point where you find yourself thinking &quot;Check the locks on your doors!&quot; &quot;Call the police!&quot; or &quot;Carry a can of mace or a stun gun!&quot;  The identity of the stalker is interesting, but his actions and goals leave more questions than they answer.	2002-12-06
US	35449670	R2AB3A4W31O34Y	0446606081	198340912	The Ax	Books	5	5	6	N	N	a masterpiece	Having read hundreds of crime novels and thrillers over the years, I've become pretty jaded, yet this book blew me away.  Westlake was able to make me feel every excruciating agonizing moment of DeVore's descent into murder, and the ending is dynamite.  Out of the dozens (sometimes hundreds) of novels I read, there is usually only one a year that really stands out.  This is one of those books.  A classic.	2002-12-06
US	35449670	R3GB35NLAFN3KU	1565048466	138718852	Death Prayer	Books	4	0	2	N	N	a chilling good read	As someone who has read about occult phenomena for nearly three and a half decades, I find most horror-occult novels to be pretty thin soup.  How satisfying it was to find a novel that just gets better and better as it goes along, delving ever deeper into occult lore until the satisfying finale.  If you like Dean Koontz, you'll love The Death Prayer.  Not a classic, but damn close.	2002-12-06

Though it suffers from various plot weaknesses and simplistic characterizations (I've docked it one star for a somewhat racist caricature), the visual descriptions of this hidden world and the geometric shapes that form and reform into various entities are the most mind-blowing this side of a tab of blotter acid.  With the advances in computer animation today, someone could do this novel justice and make a stunning movie.	2002-12-06
US	35449670	R1SJ8UUSI71N69	0380006901	115053779	Seven Footprints to Satan	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Classic pulp novel	Abraham Merritt was one of the few good writers of the pulp era, and this novel is one of the few classics.  It is not great literature by any means, but as far as escapism goes, one can't do better than this.  Who can resist a plot where famous people are kidnapped and forced to gamble for their souls by a menacing satanic figure?  In the right hands, this would make a great movie in the Indiana Jones vein.	2002-12-06

This book is jaw-droppingly awful-- I can't see how anyone with an IQ over 50 could enjoy this.  One of the main characters is a naive nubile six-foot-six Amazon who has sex at every opportunity.  Fer chrissake, my horny adolescent fantasies were more realistic.  In fact, I've read porn novels that were better written.  It pains me to think that valuable resources were used to produce this \\"novel.\\"	2002-12-06

This is not a scientific examination, but an astute psychologist's ruminations on the bond between human and canine.  It should be required reading for all dog OWNERS as well as all dog lovers, as it would help people understand the psychology of dogs better; the neglect and abuse of dogs is far too common.	2002-12-06

US	35449670	R1PI3OAFT2CAZN	069811180X	930913375	Gun in Cheek: A Study of Alternative Crime Fiction	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Like a slug of whiskey for your funny bone	Along with books on how to write, any aspiring writer should have books on how NOT to write, and this one certainly fits the bill.  It is crammed with examples of the worst in crime fiction, so it is not only a good instruction manual for helping you avoid the pitfalls of bad writing but provides a boost of morale to those who think their writing isn't up to snuff.  Should be on your bookshelf next to The Stuffed Owl and Damon Knight's In Search of Wonder.	2002-12-06
US	35449670	R1D85F23WVX1QT	0783882262	215157101	Apocalypse Wow!: A Memoir for the End of Time (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Not with a bang, but a snicker.	Okay, so the millenium has passed, but there are still some who say that apocalyptic doom is just around the corner.  James Finn Garner has taken all this doom and gloom and dissected it with a satirist's wit, hopefully putting all your fears to rest.  Imagine the skepticism of a James Randi combined with the irreverence of a Michael Moore as he tackles everything from the Bible to UFOs.  Maybe now you'll be able to sleep at night.  I recommend reading this with Stephen Jay Gould's QUESTIONING THE MILLENIUM.	2002-11-26
US	35449670	R2POY6S6F311SY	0446608483	835067122	The Pledge	Books	1	2	3	N	N	failing grade	Wow.  This has to be absolutely one of the worst novels I have ever read (and I've read some of the stuff profiled in Pronzini's GUN IN CHEEK and SON OF GUN IN CHEEK).  This is the literary equivalent of an Ed Wood movie-- ludicrous situations and dialogue so bad they have to be read to be believed.  Jaw-droppingly awful. How did this thing even get published?	2002-11-23
US	35449670	R2BYJS2Z7SGSB8	0316170771	271939084	Jake & Mimi: A Novel	Books	3	3	3	N	N	hot and cold	I guess you could call Jake & Mimi an erotic thriller.  The book is certainly erotic-- the sex scenes go on for pages and pages.  As for the thriller part, that is not so successful.  It is like dressing up a hooker in a business suit.  There is insufficient psychological depth to adequately explain the motivations of the characters, which is not helped by the fact that the identity of the villain comes out of left field.  The use of multiple narrators is sometimes confusing, and the author would have us believe that Jake can instantly make any woman fall for him and submit to his kinky games.  The villain is seemingly omniscient and is able to move about undetected like the invisible man, making him look like he stepped out of a 1930s pulp story.  The author also gets sloppy at times, having us believe, for instance, that prominent women can disappear without the media (or anyone, for that matter) taking much notice.  The rating is somewhat of a compromise, as I would give it 5 stars for eroticism and 1 star for its thriller elements.  Had I not known the publisher beforehand, I would have guessed it was Masquerade or Blue Moon or one of the half-dozen others that publish quality erotica.	2002-11-21
US	35449670	R34R1V23VHEJRK	0380004658	119654320	The Bermuda Triangle	Books	1	7	13	N	N	Completely worthless	Charles Berlitz should stick with languages, as when he ventures into the world of the paranormal, he often appears to be winging it.  His research is frequently superficial or even non-existent, as in this work.  He often gets facts wrong, and favors outlandish explanations over more plausible ones.  Don't take my word for it-- compare what he says about particular incidents with what you can find in reputable sources and you'll see what I mean.  Instead of this book, I would recommend Lawrence Kusche's THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE MYSTERY-- SOLVED, or my own THE EVIDENCE FOR THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE.  The only reason I give it 1 star is because there is no lower rating.	2002-11-21
US	35449670	R2937THOXG6L0H	0806121432	328346478	In Search of Butch Cassidy	Books	3	1	6	N	N	a case of mistaken identity	Larry Pointer has made a valiant attempt at proving that Spokane, Washington engineer and businessman William T. Phillips was, in fact, Butch Cassidy.  Unfortunately for him, this theory has now been disproven by hard evidence (see DIGGING UP BUTCH AND SUNDANCE by Anne Meadows).  In any event, he fails to adequately explain how a thrill-seeking, restless outlaw could suddenly settle down to become a respectable and successful engineer, inventor, and businessman.  Legends die hard.	2002-11-21
US	35449670	R1TR0YGFQTNA5R	0449220133	260141888	Charles Berlitz's World of the Odd and the Awesome	Books	1	4	5	N	N	odd, all right, but not very awesome	With scarcely a page devoted to each topic (he devotes little more than a page to the Loch Ness monster!), this book is way too sketchy to be of interest to anyone who has more than a passing interest in strange phenomena.  Like all of Berlitz's books on mysterious phenomena, adequate documentation is lacking-- in this case, virtually nil.  This book is all over the map, ranging from the gee-whiz Ripley's Believe It or Not!-type trivia to genuine mysteries to stuff that is just plain nonsensical (&quot;Bikini&quot; and &quot;Tomb of Ice&quot; for example).  Pass this by and read something by some of the more careful researchers in the field; Charles Fort, Jerome Clark, and Colin Wilson, for example, are just three writers in the &quot;believer&quot; camp who are infinitely better at dealing with this type of material.	2002-11-21
US	35449670	R3A4FLPZ8A7C82	0312109687	244479691	Digging Up Butch and Sundance	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Digging up the truth	Digging Up Butch and Sundance is as engrossing as any fictional detective story, thanks to Anne Meadows' exceptional writing style and dogged pursuit of the facts.  She brings to life the men behind the myth, and deals with a wealth of confusing and conflicting accounts with clarity and intelligence, spicing her story with numerous fascinating details about her and her husband's countless trips to South America in search of the truth.  While her final answers may not have solved the mystery of the outlaws' fate with 100% certainty, she has done more than anyone else to come to a solution, which is certain to satisfy all but the most of skeptical of critics.  May be the most complete (and accurate) book about their final days, and is likely to remain so.  Highly recommended.	2002-11-19
