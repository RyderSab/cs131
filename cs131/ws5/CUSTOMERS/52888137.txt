I share many of Medved's political opinions and I suspected he'd be preaching a manifesto and I'd be the choir member with toothpicks in my eyes.  Instead, the book turned out to be a personal journey not of policy, but of how he wound up in unexpected careers as a book author and movie critic.<br /><br />Along the way he also reveals how his conversion to Orthodox Judaism changed his political outlook from war protesting liberal to cultural conservative.  In many hands, such conversions could be bland as well, but Medved reflective nature is honestly revealing.  For instance, Medved explains how his beliefs at the time naturally led him to support lefty politicians like Allard Lowenstein and George McGovern.  I've always wondered how someone smart could do that and I know I better understand why.<br /><br />One thing that makes Medved's book particularly relevant today is his personal reflection on his Yale classmates like Hillary Rodham whom he found quite warm and caring during their law school days.  Medved met Bill Clinton before Hillary did and wasn't so impressed.  He still has trouble understanding how the Hillary he knew would marry such a man.  He's not much for John Kerry either, a self-promoting blowhard in memory.  Regretfully, he ran in different circles than George W. Bush so he has nothing to offer there.<br /><br />I bought his earlier book HOLLYWOOD V. AMERICA more than ten years ago and I admired it more than enjoyed it, so I'm pleasantly surprised that his personal journey was so enlightening and entertaining.	2005-09-24

THE TRUTH ABOUT HILLARY begins at childhood and highlights her youthful experiences and personal faults that would shape her into the manipulative character that felt entitled as co-President despite the fact that she didn't appear on any ballots.<br /><br />The best part of the book is the story behind her decision to run for Senator, so that she could shed her co-dependent political marriage for the less damaging carpetbagger reputation.  This was the only part of the history that I didn't know.  Klein makes Senator Moynihan a sympathetic figure that is serious about the people of New York and the problems with the country who reluctantly agrees to tepidly endorse Clinton for the good of the party.<br /><br />This is not a book that will take long to read and it's probably best for people who were too young to remember Hillary's role in the 1990s.  As a repudiation of Hillary it's better than Peggy Noonan's THE CASE AGAINST HILLARY (2000) which depended more on psychology and not enough on the treachery.	2005-09-24

I had no idea that it was a short portion of the book or that Hecht had such an interesting life without his Hollywood experience.  I certainly wasn't prepared for something so literary, adventurous and humorous.  It's a rare autobiography in that a person who had never heard of Hecht could still enjoy the book all the way through.<br /><br />Shorter attention spans might not want to spend the time to read all 600 pages, but luckily several sections can be enjoyed independently of the book as a whole.  Besides Hollywood you can't miss his reflections as a young newsman in Chicago to his eventual foreign correspondent role in Germany during the early 1920s.  He has enough stories in this ten year period that you'd think it took 30 years to live.<br /><br />His shorter New York period and collaboration with Charles MacArthur are not to be missed either.  The funniest part may be his involvement in a south Florida real estate scam.  The book ends with his involvement with Zionism and the creation of Israel.  He not only taught me history of the time, but I was surprised how controversial he was in places like Great Britain.  If you read any of those sections first, I tend to think you'll go back to the beginning not to miss everything else.<br /><br />CHILD OF THE CENTURY is the best autobiography of a Hollywood figure that I have ever read.	2005-09-24

The young maverick filmmakers of the 1970s make a decent parallel to the young maverick independents of the 1990s, the problem the author runs into is that today's directors lack the personalities of the old timers.  Without the outrageousness of guys like Coppolla, Evans, and Hopper, Biskind has to rely on the megalomania of Harvey Weinstein to carry the whole book, and it almost becomes his biography in the process.<br /><br />The story begins with Robert Redford's troubled Utah ski resort and his attempts to drive business to that remote location.  At first, moving the U.S. film festival there does no good and Redford is ready to dump the whole enterprise after nearly ten years.  Steven Soderbergh then puts the festival on the map with his inexpensive indie hit SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE and suddenly Redford is a genius.  Biskind goes on to show how poorly Soderbergh is treated by Redford from then on, even to the point of letting Soderbergh develop QUIZ SHOW only to step in and direct it himself.<br /><br />Redford is a selfish control freak, but Biskind cannot really develop this through the book, because Redford is so colorless that too many stories on him would put us to sleep.  Instead Biskind uses Harvey Weinstein to keep us awake with his love of movies and bombastic style.  Harvey is a throwback to the days before the EASY RIDERS when studio heads were tyrants and tyrants are always fun to read about even when they're horrible to work for.<br /><br />A few other characters are interesting for the short time they're profiled.  It's fun to read about Quinten Tarantino's development and the Matt Damon/Ben Affleck collaboration, but those passages end too soon.  Biskind does his best to weave all the material into an entertaining narrative, but the characters themselves let him down with their blandness.  It's probably not fair for me to compare this to Biskind's earlier work.  He'll probably never find a subject that interesting again, but I cannot help it.s probably not fair for me to compare this to Biskind's earlier work.

Since Chinatown is set in LA during the heyday of tinsel town and the growth of Los Angles, it's a good example of what the city had to go through as a result of the success of the movie business.  Towne becomes Thomson's example of how movie writers have no power compared to novelists and playwrights and that difference is one reason film is a much broader collaborative medium than other arts.<br /><br />Later in the book, Thomson uses F. Scott Fitzgerald's un-finished novel The Last Tycoon for more comparison.  First, we get his take on Fitzgerald's failure as a screenwriter and a look at his experiences knowing David Selznick and Irving Thalberg, the inspirations for the novel's protagonist, Monroe Star.<br /><br />Thomson also uses the Edward Hopper painting \\"New York Movie\\" as a thread through the book.<br /><br />These fictional comparisons are inspired and they allow Thomson to move from decade to decade smoothly.  The book discusses the importance of Eric von Stoheim, Charlie Chaplin, Nicole Kidman, Selznick, Thalberg, Louis Mayer, Lew Wasserman, and Pauline Kael among numerous other subjects.<br /><br />The only misstep in my mind is his analysis of HUAC and the early cold war.  Here's what he says, \\"...the campaign of the House Committee on Un-American Activities was unconstitutional, and its punishment, the blacklist, it was illegal... many Hollywood careers were halted, a climate of fear was established, and the prospect of an adult attitude in American pictures was set back.\\"<br /><br />First, when a butcher like Joe Stalin (who killed more people than Hitler) has an atomic bomb meant for us and Dalton Trumbo is making goo goo eyes about him, I don't feel so bad that Trumbo has to ghost write his work.<br /><br />Second, Thomson was a film professor at Dartmouth and I'm sure he isn't ignorant to the many campus speech codes around the country that are direct violations of the first amendment.  How many students are expelled every year for not following the current version of political correctness?  It's very easy to criticize people of 50 years ago while you sit back and let it continue in your own workplace today.  It doesn't seem right to portray cold war era politics as unusual when politically correct ideaology infects society and the movies just as much today.<br /><br />Those points aside, Thomson does a great job of connecting ancient film history with the modern by making interesting comparisons with fluid writing and for that I recommend the book.econd, Thomson was a film professor at Dartmouth and I'm sure he isn't ignorant to the many campus speech codes around the country that are direct violations of the first amendment.

Tom Wolfe shows us in I AM CHARLOTTE SIMMONS how incompetent the 18 year olds of today are, in the setting of a prestigious University full of the best and brightest.  His third novel should worry parents and enlighten the rest of us.<br /><br />Those familiar with Wolfe's style of new journalism will appreciate how he uses a combination of subtlety and action to reveal character traits and feelings.  Wolfe's characters are funny because they are mostly charlatans, egomaniacs or self-righteous bores.  This novel and his last both introduce sympathetic characters and he puts them into a society that doesn't understand their inherent goodness.  Wolfe makes his heroes re-think their own values in a world that would just as soon stomp on them.<br /><br />Charlotte has been given the immense gift of fleeing her poor rural life and living amongst contemporary geniuses.  What she assumes will be discussion groups on philosophy and science is, in fact, a campus of frat parties and hooking up.  She's isolated and clings to her own small town values, but as her loneliness grows deeper, she compromises little things and later bigger things to better fit in.  Wolfe gives us 700 pages to watch Charlotte's strength get sapped by the unforgiving realities of contemporary life.<br /><br />Along the way we meet jocks, geeks, frat boys, sorority girls, genius professors and radical hippy ones.  We meet college coaches and rich parents and famous politicians and very few of them come off looking noble.  Wolfe can be salacious when he describes the goings on and it's a big plus for the book, because we can enjoy the description and later feel morally superior to the acts themselves.  It's not too unlike how Cecil B. DeMille created biblical epics to get away with all kinds of lasciviousness.<br /><br />This is an unforgiving look at how modern colleges have adopted ancient Greek Bacchus like behavior, while ignoring the virtuous Socratic philosophy.  Some writers may have used this material to endlessly moralize, but Wolfe seems more like one of those ancient Greek Gods laughing from Mount Olympus.Greek Bacchus like behavior, while ignoring the virtuous Socratic philosophy.

Peter Biskind's EASY RIDERS, RAGING BULLS is a nonstop race through the lives of the young and prominent 1970s filmmakers.  Scorsese, Spielberg, Coppola, Bogdanovich, among others are targeted for the often hilarious and sometimes biting look at their early lives. He spares no one.<br /><br />It's interesting to see Spielberg portrayed as a self-conscious young filmmaker who got a lot of help on JAWS that he no longer discusses.  Biskind says that it's become legend that Spielberg had so much trouble with the shark mechanism that he kept it out of the film until the third act.  Biskind reports that Spielberg actually shot a lot of shark footage for the whole movie and it was editor, Verna Fields that left it on the floor because she thought it looked ridiculous.  Spielberg didn't have enough power back then to collaborate with an editor and the Studio trusted her and not him to bring the movie together.  Spielberg was so sure he had a flop before the release that he was trying to get the job directing \\"The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and Motor Kings.\\"<br /><br />Jaws is just one example of how the Biskind reminds the reader film is a collaborative medium.  Auteur theories and movie reviewers want to heap praise and blame on the director, but so much of what is seen in a movie is the result of someone else.<br /><br />For example, Today's discussion about the great DeNiro-Scorsese collaborations weren't designed the way people are led to believe.  It was Robert DeNiro that brought RAGING BULL to Scorsese and begged him to direct it.  Marty couldn't see a movie there and showed no interest.  It wasn't until a script was written that Marty came aboard.<br /><br />Taxi Driver was written by Paul Scharader and didn't much want Marty to direct it, but eventually relented when the studio stepped in.  Further, Marty wanted Kietel for the lead not DeNiro, but the studio insisted on Bobby who was becoming a hot property after the GODFATHER Part II.<br /><br />The book is also full of Warren Beatty's charm with Studio Heads, Peter Bogdanovich's meteoric rise and fall, Coppola's megalomania, Roman Polanski's ego and Jack Nicholson's sudden stardom.  In short, the book is a no apologies look at the people we now consider film legends and has beens.but the studio insisted on Bobby who was becoming a hot property after the GODFATHER Part II. <br /> <br />The book is also full of Warren Beatty's charm with Studio Heads, Peter Bogdanovich's meteoric rise and fall, Coppola's megalomania, Roman Polanski's ego and Jack Nicholson's sudden stardom.

I didn't think I had any interest in the subject.  But Robert Kurson's \\"Shadow Divers\\" is a great example of how a good story and good writing can make any subject worth reading.  This book is written more like a novel than a history.  Instead of telling you the facts up front, Kurson slowly doles them out as the characters make their discoveries.<br /><br />Intertwined in this book are the personal dramas of the characters, the dangers of diving at depths of over 200 feet and the mystery of what the heck these guys found.  The results are the heroism of discovery, the tragedy of deep sea deaths and the fulfillment of finding the answers.<br /><br />At the center is hero, John Chatterton, a Vietnam Vet who's more in touch with his bravery and sense of adventure than any man you're likely to meet up close.  This is a medic that would volunteer to lead patrols in Vietnam just to be in the thick of things.<br /><br />Richie Kohler begins the book as a competitor to Chatterton in the wreck diving business, but his ability under water and his sincerity in the quest would earn him the friendship of Chatterton as time went on.<br /><br />The quest takes years and leads to so many dead ends that you think that the truth will be impossible to find.  Without giving any details away, these men succeed and even re-write history.  It's one of those books that you read all weekend with the TV off and cell phone set to buzz.	2004-11-20

There was something about his \\"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash\\" that won me over although I had no great interest in his singing outside his novelty songs.  As I got older I began to like the music quite a bit, but you don't have to be a fan to enjoy his book.<br /><br />His story of growing up on a poor farm, a hitch in the military, his early music career, drug abuse, redemption, true love and a musical rebirth would work even if you'd never heard Johnny Cash tune.  And it works mostly because it's such an honest portrayal of what a jerk he was and how he still struggles to be the man he wants to be.  So many of these kinds of books are self-congratulatory, but Cash is just thankful that he got through it.<br /><br />Along the way Johnny shares great stories of other famous musicians.  He knew everybody even before they were anybody.  I didn't know that he owned a house in Jamaica.  I didn't know that he lived next door to Roy Orbison.  I didn't know a lot of this stuff.<br /><br />But the theme that runs through the book is Cash's religious faith and how it kept him alive.  He says that he traded commercial success in the 1970s to record gospel music and that made him happier than anything else.<br /><br />Some musicians are only interesting in what they produce over a short span of their lives. Johnny produced all kinds of music and hardly stayed in a genre very long, but he turned out to be just as interesting off stage and this book is a document of that.	2004-10-26

He's the most serious about himself and the office of President.  He's a very formal man who admits to Green that he never called Eisenhower, Ike, in their private meetings.  It was always General or Mr. President.  Further, Nixon's best friend, Bebe Rebozo, always addressed Nixon as Mr. President from the day he was elected onward even when they were alone.<br /><br />Greene's meetings with Carter revealed how hands-on the guy is.  Whether he is seeing to one of his charities or meeting with his fellow faculty members at Emory University, Carter is on hand and active.  Greene's experience would lead one to believe that Carter's immersion into things may have been a hindrance to his presidency where there were just too many concerns to handle personally.<br /><br />George Bush 41 revealed himself as a decent chap during a 1994 meeting in Chicago when he and Jeb were in town to address some businessmen.  Since Jeb was running for Florida governor that year (He lost) and brother George W. was running for Governor of Texas that same year (He won) Greene lets the episode be as much about passing the baton as anything else.<br /><br />Ford seems such a normal guy because unlike the others who have books to write, charities to tend to, or sons to groom, Ford is just plain retired playing golf in Palm Springs.  The Ford visit is interesting because he talks with Betty alone when Gerry is outside doing a golf documentary shoot.  He asks her some of the same questions he asked the former president and he gets different answers.  When asked what he would have done had he not become President, Gerry says that he'd probably be living in Michigan retired from practicing law.  Betty says that they would have moved to Southern California just the same.  When asked the toughest day of his life, Gerry says losing re-election to Carter.  Betty says his toughest day was no doubt her cancer surgery.  The most interesting comment is that Gerry feels closer to Carter than any of the other former Republican Presidents.<br /><br />The book ends with Greene's attempt to meet Reagan at the Ronald Regan Freedom Awards, but Reagan had already made his Alzheimer's announcement and he would cancel his appearance.  Still, Greene does a good job of explaining Nancy's fill-in for him, something she would learn to do for the next ten years.  The recipient of that night's award of Prime Minister Rabin of Israel, and he would sadly die of assassination a year later.<br /><br />At first glance there isn't a whole lot to the book.

He tells you about how the bombs sounded as they landed near him and how he saw his friends get cut down in the prime of life.  You get a pretty good feeling for what it must have been like to dig a foxhole and wait for the mortar fire.  It's scary the way he relates having come upon on a bunch of lost Germans who could have killed him had he paused a few seconds.  When he describes the onset of winter and his men without the proper protective gear losing digits to frostbite, you can just imagine some bureaucrat sitting by a toasty fire promising to get on that tomorrow.<br /><br />It's amazing that Wilson could write such a detailed history forty years after the events occurred, but maybe even more amazing that he doesn't embellish the situations.  There is little reflection on an event because he's off describing the next firefight or lost buddy.<br /><br />The most frustrating parts of the book were seeing raw officers replacing fallen soldiers rather than promoting the battle proven officers in the field.  It was not only unfair, but unsafe and yet the bigwigs away from the fighting didn't know the difference.<br /><br />The title refers to a commander who told Wilson before he went into battle that he'd be promoted if he survived.  The promotions were slower coming than his successes and yet the war is such a long way away from this retired insurance salesman that he doesn't seem that upset about his treatment.

Why do such shallow adolescents become such productive citizens? The answer lies in the hard reality of the American economy that insists that we get tough. That reality argues Barone makes us the most productive nation in the world.<br /><br />But why are they so incompetent at 18? Because the education system in this country caters to whims, social experiments and self-esteem, but it doesn't force teenagers to confront the hardness of the real world.  It's not until these kids reach the workforce that they are compelled to be serious.<br /><br />In Europe it's almost the opposite. Their schools are tough and their children outperform ours, but those kids are dumped into a welfare state economy that coddles them the rest of their lives. Very few 30 years-old Europeans can compete with their American contemporaries.<br /><br />American kids that do work harder when they are younger wind up in the most elite colleges.  The irony is that they don't always appreciate how the hard road prepared them for greater success. Many of the ones that enter public service push for a softer America in the form of welfare, unemployment and government regulations.<br /><br />Barone traces the two Americas back to World War II when big government teamed up with big labor and big business to run the war machine. Those economies of scale were supposed to make America soft yet productive. It looked efficient and we certainly won the war, but that model showed its flaws the in later years.<br /><br />By the 1970s, auto manufacturers for instance were paying higher and higher union wages and American cars began to be overpriced compared to the new Japanese imports. It led to a crisis of what fashionable economic planners thought about production.  All three of the big automakers were on the brink of collapse at one point or the other.  They had been afraid to innovate suddenly they were forced to.<br /><br />In addition, half of the top 100 industrial firms in 1974 were bankrupt or bought out by 2000 and yet the U.S. economy grew because hard realities were back. European economies, on the other hand, haven't grown that much in the last 20 years. Even economies like Japan that once scared us terribly failed to unseat us as the economic leaders.<br /><br />These are just a few of the examples that Barones cites. And Barone does concede that America has been better off for certain kinds of softness, and many people who promote softness do it for the best of reasons. But Americans are better served with a steady dose of hardness.e forced to.

From his career as a merchant Marine in World War II up unto his creation and production of 60 minutes, Hewitt shares anecdotes and accolades of the people he's worked with and against.<br /><br />He began in television news back when the Murrows and the Cronkites wouldn't have considered leaving radio.  He produced the only Kennedy-Nixon debate and is convinced that not wearing makeup on TV cost Nixon the election.  He didn't really care for Nixon much post Watergate, but unlike most of the newsmen of his generation, he didn't really fall for the aura of John Kennedy either.<br /><br />Hewitt tells of how he convinced Frank Sinatra to sit down with Walter Cronkite in the mid 1960s, and how Sinatra blew up when questioned about his mob ties.  Luckily for Hewitt he was around long enough to outlive Sinatra and get the real story from his daughter Tina 30 years later.  The story gives more plausibility to the Kennedy assassination being a mob hit.<br /><br />The latter half of the book focuses on Bill Clinton's infamous interview during the 1992 election and how Hewitt's treatment of James Carville got the show barred from the White House.<br /><br />Near the end he goes in to a deep explanation of Lowell Bergman and the inaccuracies of the film THE INSIDER.  After explaining for pages and pages of how Bergman is disingenuous, he catches us off guard by saying that he would have forgiven the filmmakers everything had they cast Robert Redford in his role.  Philip Baker Hall isn't an actor, that's a dormitory, Hewitt jokes.<br /><br />Hewitt is an interesting guy with a great life and it's hard not to like this book.	2004-09-30

This abridged audio version eliminates the central problem with the printed book.<br /><br />Whereas the full text spends chapters describing the fictional Morris character who would later know Reagan and write this book, the audio version summarizes those chapters and gets on to the good stuff.  To the credit of Morris he reads the books himself and lets the editors cut out his favorite parts.<br /><br />What's left of the book is entertaining and informative.  Morris has a novelist's way of describing events unfold and he clearly likes Reagan even if he doesn't understand him.<br /><br />The telling of the attempted assassination is particularly good.  He sets the scene nicely and captures the thoughts and actions of the principles quite well.<br /><br />Having traveled with Reagan to his summits with Gorby, Morris spends a good portion of the book telling his first hand account of those actions.  Or was it Morris the fictional character that attended?<br /><br />There was a really good book to be mined here had Morris only lopped off his story device and got to the heart of the matter.  The audio version almost corrects this flaw with the addition by subtraction method.	2004-09-24

It's going to be hard for historians to peddle the notion that he was a dunce after sifting through his writings on all of these far-ranging subjects.  The media darling Clinton certainly couldn't focus long enough to present so many arguments so clearly and for such a long time.<br /><br />The book of these 3 minute radio pieces is fascinating, but it can't compare to the great man reading the entries himself.  Reagan can be serious and humorous, but he never loses his optimism.  He brought to America a different kind of politics.  He could lay out serious problems facing the country and yet positive changes that could make us a better nation.  It allows his commentaries to be serious without the whining associated with so many out-of-power politicians.<br /><br />Many of the policy decisions he would later make are included here, but some of the most interesting entries are on government operations you don't think about.<br /><br />A good example is Reagan explaining the monopoly of the postal system with such precision that it is amazing that the system lasted throughout his eight years.  Reagan tells of how small companies learned better ways to transport first class mail locally and were shutdown for doing so.  He then compares the postal rates to long distance phone rates and how you could once send a 100 letters for the price of a long distance call, whereas by the 1970s you could only send three.  Of course, nowadays you could read a ten page letter cheaper than sending it, only further proving his point.  Reagan ends by reminding listeners that although a real monopoly exists in the Post Office and the inefficiency therein causes rising prices and reduced services, the government is chasing down ATT as a monopoly although they have outperformed the government in every way.  Reagan proves, in essence, that the only monopoly that wins is the one at a point of a gun.<br /><br />In addition to the Reagan entries, the set has a nice commentary by Reagan associates and the editors of the series.  It's well produced and no less than fine entertaining history.essence, that the only monopoly that wins is the one at a point of a gun.   <br /> <br />In addition to the Reagan entries, the set has a nice commentary by Reagan associates and the editors of the series.

I've read enough about the Civil War to have a decent understanding of Lincoln's Civil War years, but Keneally does a good concise job of leading the reader up to that point.  This poor Lincoln could be compared to Job in so many ways.  His wife Mary Todd would have been a handful for anyone, but circumstances resulted in him burying half his children from some disease or another.  Lincoln then goes on to save the nation only to find a bullet.<br /><br />Again and again in his career, Lincoln escaped his own ego in order to pursue the greater end.  His homely self-effacing appearance and manner led many to underestimate him and he let them do so to win points later.  You could argue that it won him the Republican nomination, because \\"smarter\\" men thought that they could control him.  It was the same thing in his cabinet and with his commanding General, McClellan.  Everybody wondered how this \\"idiot\\" could be in charge of the country.  Some like McClellan never got wise, even after being roundly defeated by Lincoln in the 1864 election.  Others like Stanton and Seward grew to understand Lincoln's brand of genius.<br /><br />Like good literature, Lincoln dies at the end of the story rather than serving two more terms of mediocrity.  Also like good literature, it was a southerner that killed the man, and the result of that action was a much harsher treatment by the radical Republicans toward the south than Lincoln would have cottoned too.  As a reader of Shakespeare, Lincoln would have enjoyed the cosmic joke of it all.<br /><br />Lincoln's greatness is without question so it's a little hard for an author to find fault with the man, but Keneally does what he can to present the full Lincoln and I enjoyed his 200 pages.	2004-09-12

Wood lays out how Franklin's experiences pushed him away from Britain, and how Franklin's own hard work became a hallmark for American behavior through the years.  In a sense, we learn why Franklin became an American and why we consider him such a quintessential one.<br /><br />It's not usually stressed that Franklin loved the British Empire and wanted to be a player in London politics.  After retiring from the Printing business, Franklin spent most of the next 20 years in England making friends and influencing colonial policy.  His scientific experiments and inventions made him famous the world over and the colonies looked rather small to him.<br /><br />What made the difference was Franklin's work as an agent for Pennsylvania and Mass.  While those associations got Franklin in the middle of British politics, they also made him suspect when the colonies began to rebel.  Though Franklin had no pulse on the colonies and wanted to remain loyal to the King, he was a readily available target to British Politicians who felt America was ungrateful.  Franklin eventually understood that the colonists would never be treated as equals and they were wasting their time as part of the empire.<br /><br />He may have been one of the last to get the message, but he was one of the most fervent converts thereafter.  He was a signer of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and almost solely responsible for bringing France into the American Revolution without which America never would have gained independence.<br /><br />Just as important as to why we see Franklin as the first American is his legacy of entrepreneurship.  Franklin's example of humble beginnings to riches is a uniquely American phenomenon.  Franklin's reputation has grown a bundle since his death in 1790 and much of it has to do with his Autobiography that stresses thrift and hard work.  These were unusual ideas in Europe and never fully embraced as they were here.  As America built a stronger nation, Franklin continued to be one of the patron saints.<br /><br />Wood makes you wonder how different America would be if Franklin hadn't been Americanized..

But author and scientist Brian Sykes also gives us a capsule of his career as a researcher that led him to this ultimate discovery.<br /><br />An early Sykes story has him passing through the Polynesian islands on sabbatical and collecting several samples DNA.  He was interested in whether the islanders were descendants of Asians as commonly believed by scientists or South Americans which was Thor Heyerdahl's conclusion in the famous book Kon-Tiki.  With enough samples of DNA, Sykes was able to solve the puzzle.<br /><br />Along the way, the author used DNA to solve the mystery of Czar Nicholas and his family and whether the lady who said she was Anastasia was genuine.<br /><br />After such experiences, Sykes was well equipped to handle the DNA of the ancient Ice Man found in the early 1990s.  That strand of DNA led to this book about our ancient mothers.<br /><br />I'm not a frequent reader of science, but Sykes' book is also a mystery and the two complement each other well.<br /><br />The part I liked the least was Sykes fictional biographies of the seven women he identified.  The sketches were interesting, but they seemed kind of corny on the heels of the hard science delivered up front.  But maybe that part was essential for us to get an idea of their lives, and I liked the book a great deal anyway.<br /><br />There's something exciting about the fact that our DNA can be used to trace back our ancestors and this book opened up my eyes to the possibilities.	2004-08-01

He also gives a decent description of Bush's role as ambassador, CIA director and chairman of the RNC in the 1970s.  All through the era, Wicker paints Bush as a good soldier for the Republicans, and he comes off as an honorable man.<br />But once Bush becomes Vice President, Wicker is disappointed in him.  Wicker sees Bush as a sell-out of his moderate Republican leanings for the red meat Reagan policies.  He compares Bush to a chameleon that changes his colors to blend into the current campaign strategy.  On top of that, Wicker contends that Bush could easily change political stripes because he lacked vision and purpose.<br />Okay, Bush lacked vision, but Wicker doesn't seem to value vision at all when it came from Ronald Reagan.  In fact, in the middle of a biography of Bush, Wicker deems it necessary to tell us that Reagan's vision of a Soviet Free Europe had absolutely no role in bringing down that superpower.  He's just got to tell us that Gorby saved the world not Reagan.  That Gorby's goal was the opposite of Reagan's doesn't mean anything to this objective journalist.  Does that mean that Gorby lacked vision too?  Didn't that genius understand that people would be better off out from under his iron boot?  Come to think of it, maybe Hitler would have fallen apart too if we'd just given him a chance.  History is just replete with examples of totalitarian governments that renounce themselves and become free without outside agitation.<br />That's the main problem with Wicker's book.  It's less a biography of Bush than a step by step criticism of Republican ideology and its failings.  How dare a Republican administration treat Saddam Hussein nicely when he was beating up on the hated Iranians.  Surely they knew 10 years in advance that he would invade Kuwait and we'd have to go to war with him.<br />Bush certainly lacked vision compared to Ronald Reagan.  But after 8 years of Clinton, a person can sure grow found of decency, loyalty and personal honor.  Wicker says as much during the last paragraph of the book.  His conclusion is that Bush may have been a mess, but at least he was a brave guy who won the Gulf War.  It was almost like the Penguin editors added that at the end so as not to upset Bush enthusiasts.<br />Every public figure should have positive and negative books written about him/her in order for students of history to get a wide picture.  Books are part of the great debate.  The trouble with this book is that it's not a good place for conjecture over substance.  In a 200 page Penguin Lives' book, I would like to have an outline of the guy's life not a political fight.  Wicker could have easily written a larger biography of Bush somewhere else and told us what a numbskull he was.  It seems out of place in this series.

The mystery itself is interesting but secondary in importance to the setting of Harlem and the many characters that live there.  Himes has a great style and he uses dialect just enough to give us a sense of setting.<br />Gravedigger Jones and Coffin Johnson have names that sound like a couple of cops that don't mind putting the occasional criminal under the grass -- and they do.  They're introduced shortly after the opening murder and they prove themselves immediately tough and competent.<br />Gravedigger and Coffin learn that the mystery goes deeper than one shooting.  (It usually does in these kinds of novels).  What's interesting is the way the people of Harlem respects these black cops, but still don't trust them.  Their ability is even respected by the white cops that don't mind uttering the frequent racial slur towards the casual citizenry.  Gravedigger and Coffin are in a world between the white establishment and the everyday people of Harlem.  The conflict creates the same kind of tension that Marlowe and Spade have with the regular police.<br />You can also give Himes credit for not stereotyping any of the characters black or white.  The white cops aren't all corrupt and the blacks aren't all angels.  The book made for a quick and interesting getaway.	2004-07-07

The first section is a memoir of his writing and the second section is full of writing tips.<br />The first section begins with King's childhood writings and works its way into his adulthood as a clothes washer, teacher and struggling writer.  When King finally sells his first novel Carrie you want to put the book down and applaud.<br />Even with that great ending, I tend to like the second part a little better.  You learn that King hates adverbs and it was hard for him to write a nonfiction book.  It must have been tough, because the book doesn't really have a central focus.  He makes up for it though with a great writing style and sense of humor.<br />An interesting tidbit is that his famous accident happened in the middle of writing this.  So you also get the story of the accident along with everything else.  How many authors could write with such humor and grace as they described their own mangling?<br />I've never read Stephen King's fiction because I don't really like that genre.  Reading his smooth style here makes me think I will give one a chance at some point.  I can see why he sells so many books.	2004-07-01

He's tough but human as he describes to his female client. &quot;If I wasn't hard, I wouldn't be alive.  If I couldn't ever be gentle, I wouldn't deserve to be alive.&quot;<br />I have no idea whether Marlowe's life is an accurate portrayal of a Los Angeles Private Eye during the 1930-1950s.  You have to figure that their lives were a lot less exciting than Philip Marlowe's.  And maybe that alone makes this novel a little underrated.  Its scant plot is probably more in order with what would really happen to a PI.  We're pre-conditioned to every detective case being about a series of murders.<br />I do know that Marlowe's experiences, tactics and observations make these books a fun journey.  He wrote so very few during his years that even the calmer ones like Playback are worth the time spent.	2004-06-23

Sloan Wilson's insightful novel gives readers an opportunity to see how a World War II veteran might handle the rat race in 1950s New York City.<br />Tom and Betsey Rath are married with three kids trying to keep up with the Joneses in their Connecticut suburb while Tom climbs the corporate ladder in Manhatten.  The day to day conflicts are pretty interesting, but about halfway through the novel, Tom sees someone that brings his war past into the present.<br />The title of the book has come to mean the bland working man of the 1950s, but our hero Tom Rath is not bland.  He has enough inner conflicts to field an Olympic team.  Tom isn't some sycophant trying to get ahead, but a guy who killed and watched his friends get killed in the war.  I wasn't expecting the depth of character.<br />The novel is written in clear direct language that makes it easy to follow the story and the real complexities of life.  Stylistically, the omnipotent narrator is usually in the head of our hero Tom, but he occasionally jumps around to other minds for variation.  Just as you've made up your mind about a simple character the narrator jumps into their skin and they too become a flesh and blood person.<br />The modern day criticism is that the novel has a happy ending, especially since happy endings are frowned upon in post-modern literature.  But the important part of the book is not the resolution but the journey and Wilson gets the journey just right.  I'm glad I gave the book a chance.	2004-06-18

The end of the book is Feyman's case for the importance of science.  In between we get the sad, but sweet story of his first wife and the utterly compelling story of his time on the committee investigating the challenger explosion.  It was my favorite part of the book.<br />The description of how government committees decide facts and make recommendations was eye opening.  It was the best description of how these things work that I've ever read.  Feynman was constantly up against a committee chairman that wanted to keep everyone in a room asking questions of experts.  Feynman didn't like that setup.  He wanted to travel out to NASA and talk to engineers, so he did.<br />Going to Huston and Canaveral, Feynman learned something about the nature of NASA that probably goes for any big organization.  He found that NASA was a unified force when their goal was putting a man of the moon.  Information was shared freely and appreciated at every level.  Once that goal was met NASA became compartmentalized.<br />Leaders at the top spent their time reassuring Congress that NASA would achieve their goals with low costs and high safety.  Engineers at the bottom realized that this wasn't entirely possible.  The middle managers didn't want to hear the challenges because they would be forced to report it to the top bosses who didn't want to hear it.  It was much easier for top bosses to paint a rosy picture to Congress if they were unaware of the actual challenges of making it work.  The end result was that top bosses said that the likelihood of a mission death was 1-100,000 while engineers on the ground felt that the likelihood was more like 1-300.<br />Feynman concludes that maybe the shuttle program was a bad idea.  It could never live up to the ambitious projections of the leaders and the American public was being lied to.  NASA should be honest with the American people, Feynman thought, then Congress and voters can decide if they are getting enough for their money.  It was a surprisingly thing to hear from an advocate of science and discovery.  But Feynam reckoned that the amount of science and discovery has been little compared to the cost.  He complained years after the first shuttle launch he still hadn't read any significant experiments in scientific journals.<br />In all, I liked this book a little better than \\"Surely You're Joking.\\"  It was a little more thought provoking than those fun tales.could never live up to the ambitious projections of the leaders and the American public was being lied to.

From the earliest times I can remember gavels coming down by angry congressmen as meek witnesses calmly express their disagreement with a committee that would make them \\"name names.\\"  The witnesses seemed real pathetic and the committee chairmen all come off as power mad scoundrels looking for a headline.  The poor Hollywood Ten went to jail or fled to Europe to write movies under fictitious names.<br />What none of the pictures or narration ever told me was that every member of the Hollywood Ten had been a communist at some point in his life and that half of the Hollywood ten were still communists when they went to jail for contempt of court.  Since they weren't making the defense in front of Congress that they had the right to be  communists, the event was portrayed as a \\"witch hunt.\\"  These were just misunderstood new deal liberals that wanted more socialism than the House Un-American Activities Committee.<br />What Mr. Billingsley shows in his excellently researched book is that they weren't just a bunch of artistic idealists, but a group of avowed Marxists being funded by and taking orders from Moscow.  It's not an open question.  They were given orders to get collectivist messages into Hollywood films.  They were told not to portray capitalism or businessmen in a good light.  Writer Budd Schulberg was criticized by the party because his book \\"What Makes Sammy Run?\\" didn't achieve any of the party's goals.  Some of these guys were even writing articles for the communist Daily Worker under their own names.<br />Modern Hollywood liberals make the communist party members the victims of some horrible black period in American history without any thought to what Stalin was doing to his people in Russia (or would have liked to have done here).  Somehow, the liquidation and forced starvation of millions is nothing compared to a few screenwriters that have to write under an alias.<br />Quick can you name one innocent blacklisted person whose life was ruined?  I can only think of the fictional Robert DeNiro character from Guilty by Suspicion.  The character had to be fictional in order prove their dramatic point.  Had they made the movie about a real person who went through such things he would have had to have been an actual communist.  DeNiro plays a clueless liberal that is blacklisted because he was at a few parties.  There weren't any of these misunderstandings in real life.<br />Until I read Mr. Billingsley's book I had no idea that Hollywood was plagued by violent strikes in the 1940s whose purpose was bringing all the Hollywood trade unions under the control of communist, Herbert Sorrell.  John Howard Lawson was trying to gain control of the Screenwriters Guild at the same time with the overall plan of controlling the content of Hollywood movies.  Isn't it a little scary that this was being funded by a totalitarian government?<br />None of the facts of this period are ever discussed.  It's simply boiled down to communists as idealists and anti-communists as opportunists.  In order to perpetuate that myth, Hollywood has since ignored the many opportunities to present the horrors of Communist Russia the way they have presented the horrors of Nazi Germany.  The recent film, The Pianist, about Jewish life in World War II Warsaw, Poland doesn't even once mention that the Nazis and Russians divvy up Poland at the beginning of the war.  All you hear is that the Germans invade in 1942 and the Russians liberate in 1945.  That misses the whole point of what happened to Poland in the 20th Century.  But it does perpetuate the myth.<br />The tactic used in front of the committee hearings was to pretend that it was no one's business what their political affiliation was.  That's cute, but would Hollywood have stood up for Nazis or Ku Klux Klan members under the auspices of first amendment freedom?  The answer is readily available today.  Mel Gibson's movie \\"The Passion of Christ\\" was roundly criticized for having the \\"wrong kind\\" of independent thought.  They tend to like the kind of independent thought that also coincides with their prejudices like \\"Fahrenheit 911.\\"  Now that's free expression worth getting behind.<br />Mr. Billingsley's book is so on target with what isn't discussed by Hollywood when they cry about the blacklist that it will forever be an indictment of those people who perpetuate the common myth.of first amendment freedom?

The description of that event is a small part of the book.  Author, Michael Parenti is more interested in Caesar the reformer and how that got him killed.<br />What impressed me about the book is the amount of praise that Parenti finds from the people toward Caesar and the amount of negative information that the author digs up about Cicero, Cato, Brutus and the other usual heroes of the saga.  It's interesting because historians traditionally give Caesar's assassins credit for trying to save the Republic while Caesar is usually cast as the power hungry despot.  Parenti reverses these roles.  He asserts that Caesar's concern over average citizens put him at odds with the landed class and they killed him because he was bad for business.<br />The hard part about the book is that Parenti seems to find no fault in the kinds of leaders that stir up the masses.  Sure some of those leaders have good intentions, but just as many of them are using the needs of people to build a power base.  It's the nature of politics and politicians.  Parenti seems to take any social reformer as unselfish hero.  This error is common among a certain world view and in extreme cases it's been used to explain the merits of butchers like Castro or Stalin.<br />Parenti also uses phrases like class prerogatives and social justice, as if there were a form of justice unrelated to human beings.  Those terms seem out of date in 2004 when it's been shown all over the world that statist economies cannot keep up with the free market.  Countries that use more central planning have higher inflation and unemployment rates and the cost of living is always higher there.  \\"Class prerogatives\\" and \\"social justice\\" may have been handy terms when the question of economies was up in the air.  But in today's world they come off as jealousies rather than plans to make people's lives better.<br />Parenti did convince me that Caesar probably had more positives than the average historian is willing to give him.  Maybe his willingness to redistribute wealth had more to do with his death than popularly recognized.  Still, I don't think Parenti makes a good case that Caesar the dictator was a better scenario than a free republic.  I'd rather live in a free country where some people have more than I have, especially when I have more than the average person in the world.  It's true for Americans today and for ancient Romans.<br />The fact that I disagree with the conclusions doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy the case that Parenti makes.  This is a well researched book and it made me think analytically about things that I hadn't considered before.

But Stossel's consistency of looking for the truth never wavered.  His targets just became a little hard for the left to take.<br />One of the most interesting points in the book is one that economist Walter Williams has made several times.  Stossel says licensing agencies have done a great deal to keep people out of certain lines of work.  He uses a good hair care example in Washington D.D.  People in the profession sit on the licensing board that decides who gets the new licenses.  The result is that consumers have fewer inexpensive choices and able-bodied people are out of work.  Though Stossel doesn't say it as directly as Walter Williams, these kinds of licensing issues coupled with closed-shop union policies are a major contributor to black poverty.<br />This is an easy to read book that you can get through in an afternoon if you're interested in Stossel, libertarianism or just where the heck all your tax money goes.	2004-05-19

Paul's cooperation and reflections are the bulk of the book.  Between passages of history, McCartney adds long quotes about his memories and experiences of specific events.  He disagrees with the public record on some pretty interesting things.<br />First, he doesn't believe the popularly held idea that the death of Brian Epstein was anything but an accident.<br />Second, he says that the Beatles were never angry at the Maharishi.  They didn't consider him a fraud as popularly reported.  They had just learned everything they needed to learn from him and they wanted to get back to real life.  Paul says he still meditates using the mantra taught to him by the Mararishi.  John's song Sexy Sadie was indeed about some disillusionment with the spiritual leader, but the feelings weren't lasting.<br />Third, the collaboration between John and Paul lasted into the later years of the Beatles when most people assumed that they were writing their songs solo and tacking on the other's name.  Paul talks about John's help with Hey Jude and his own contribution to the Ballad of John and Yoko.<br />Fourth, Paul is very fair with everyone.  He doesn't blame Yoko for breaking up the Beatles.  He thinks that Yoko probably saved the H addicted John's life and thus extended the life of the Beatles.  He surprisingly doesn't blame Yoko for his conflicted relationship with John after the breakup.<br />People can argue on whether McCartney's vision is the reality or what he wants to portray.  Either way, you won't get a complete picture of the Beatles without reading this book.	2004-05-18
US	52888137	R35LV1YJBBLKD1	1586480308	539913658	Governor Reagan: His Rise To Power	Books	5	17	17	N	N	Strong Account of Reagan's Early Political Days	Governor Reagan is a well-crafted book by the biographer that seems to know Reagan best.  Since Cannon has already written an in-depth book on the Reagan Presidency (Role of a Lifetime), this book serves as a perfect lead into that one.  Surprisingly, there's a good deal more about Reagan's early life and Hollywood career than the title would lead you to believe.  We don't get to the Governor's race until page 129 and the last 100 pages of the book are about Reagan's post Governor days including the challenge to Ford in 1976 and his 1980 campaign win.  In essence, this becomes the Reagan Presidency prequel.<br />What's great about Cannon's work is that he seems to take an even-handed approach to his subject.  That's uncommon for writers who usually give Reagan a heavy diet of adulation or scorn.<br />Cannon contends that Reagan's experience as a union leader gave him the ability to find compromises through negotiation.  It helped him a great deal in California with an Assembly led by the opposition.  He was ideological sure but Reagan also wanted to accomplish something.  He was willing to concede certain points to win the bigger ones.  This is a good point that probably isn't made enough when discussing his success.<br />I found Reagan's six years between offices and how he nearly (and probably) won the Republican nomination in 1976 the most interesting.  It was a tough decision to challenge the incumbent President of his own party.  He didn't want to alienate fellow Republicans or hurt his future political chances.  Therefore, the challenge was full of drama and Cannon writes a roadmap from primary to convention.<br />The book ends with the 1980 Reagan campaign and his becoming President Elect.  If you're interested in Reagan you won't find a more thorough account of his political career before Washington.	2004-05-17

Books	5	31	32	N	N	Jesse Jackson's nightmare	Although written 20 years ago, Thomas Sowell's book about the Civil Rights Movement reads like it was penned last month.  Unlike many academics that simply take social policy at face value and support any policy that sets out to help, Economist Dr. Sowell measures the success of initiatives against their purported intentions.  This is a great formula for honest education, but it doesn't win many friends in academia.<br />Sowell demonstrates how discrimination alone does not result in poverty.  He points out the success of the Chinese minority in many Asian countries where discrimination against the Chinese is written into the constitution.  He also points out the many hardships put towards Jews in history and their accumulation of wealth despite the hardships.<br />He shows some curiosity in how striving for equal opportunity in America eventually became affirmative action.  He has the same curiosity about how de-segregation became busing.  He then takes a hard look at the special cases of women and blacks.<br />Since the book was set at the 30th anniversary of Brown v. The Board of Education and the 20th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Sowell examines the conditions of education and economics before and after those important dates.  He finds just the kinds of facts that will be detested by the Civil Rights industry.<br />Dr. Sowell concludes that Civil Rights have become an easy way to gain favor with whatever new initiative someone might design.  Now everything is a Civil Right and every new plague known to man is not usually the result of a denial of Civil Rights.<br />The question no one but Sowell asks is how can we expect an equal outcome in the world when humans all have different experiences and abilities? His conclusion is that the Civil Rights movement was important when Jim Crow insured unfair treatment, but now the term Civil Rights has been perverted to mean anything that gains some group or another power.  In essence, the current reality of Civil Rights is, in fact, rhetoric.<br />You may not understand the full impact of what Civil Rights mean today if you don't read these 140 pages.

He says that World War II was approached as an international version of the New Deal.  FDR didn't just want to win he wanted to re-shape the world.  Fleming believes FDR's insistence on fighting the Germans in North Africa, insisting on unconditional German surrender, ignoring the dangers of communism and specifically trusting Joseph Stalin were major blunders that cost untold lives during and after the war.<br />First, by fighting the Germans in North Africa, FDR made Joe Stalin's encroachment on Eastern Europe all the more easy.  Had he instead focused on beating the Japanese and protecting England exclusively, Hitler could have used his entire force to fight Stalin.  They would have butchered one another without as many U.S. casualties, and the end result would have been two weakened madmen which would have given Stalin less chance to seize Eastern Europe.<br />Second, although it may not be discussed these days, FDR's insistence of unconditional surrender was quite controversial.  No less than Eisenhower himself thought it was a foolish idea, but even more interesting is that it was almost unprecedented in the history of war.  Fleming points out that the U.S. (Unconditional Surrender) Grant got the name from his siege at Vicksburg, not the General Lee surrender which was quite cordial and accommodating.<br />Unconditional surrender was a mistake for two reasons says Fleming.  It made it much less likely that regular Germans would attempt to overthrow Hitler, because unconditional surrender assumed that all Germans were equally guilty.  There were even cables from prominent Germans through neutral Switzerland that tried to negotiate an easier surrender if they offed Hitler, but FDR would have none of it.  He blamed the Germans for two world wars and wanted to bring them to their knees.  With FDR it was less about Hitler and more about defeating the wicked Huns.  The cost was hundreds of thousands of American lives that could have been saved with a more temperate policy.<br />Third, Lauchlin Currie, Senior Administrative assistant to the President, Assistant Secretary of State Harry Dexter White, and State Department officials Alger Hiss and Lawrence Duggan have all been proven spies by the declassified Venona Project.  They had access to classified documents and turned them over to other Soviet operatives.  Reformed communist, Whitaker Chambers told Assistant Secretary of State Adolf Berle about these men as early as 1939, but when Berle informed FDR, he said it was absurd.  FDR always trusted fellow Ivy League men over the evidence, and didn't really see communism as much of a threat anyway.<br />When he met Joesph Stalin during the war, he began calling him Uncle Joe and told confidants that he had \\"gotten to him\\" during their discussions.  He allowed important meetings that decided post war policy to occur in places like the Soviet embassy in Terhan where every conversation he had was being listened to by the Russians.  He even took communist spies like Alger Hiss to the Yalta conferece, where Hiss passed on who knows what information to \\"Uncle\\" Joe.<br />Fleming says that all of FDR's mistakes were the result of treating World War II as a social project for the planet.  FDR could have beaten the Germans, weakened the Soviets considerably and saved more American lives if his priorities had been winning the war and peace.  His more lofty goals of reshaping the world gave him a skewed view of communism and led to the enslavement of Europeans and the deaths of too many Americans.<br />Fleming seems to be on to something here.  FDR had his plusses, but the idolatry of Roosevelt has led many people to disregard his grand mistakes.

US	52888137	R1G6WGTM07DYAM	0760314829	144293987	Dimaggio: Setting the Record Straight	Books	4	9	14	N	N	DiMaggio From the Other Side	I assumed that Setting the Record straight was meant to refute the charges brought by Richard Ben Cramer in his (2000) biography of Joe.  It does parry most of those charges, but Engleberg is too shrewd to come out and name Cramer as the inspiration for the book.  Why have your audience run and read Cramer's book too?<br />Engelberg's account is naturally more sympathetic than Cramer's.  For instance, Cramer says that Joe was noted for having many random affairs with women, Engelberg says offhandedly that Joe had no trouble with the ladies.  Cramer describes Joe's late in life autograph sessions as crass commercialism.  Engelberg says that finally Joe DiMaggio was making the money that so many others had been making on his name.<br />It's these differences in presentation that characterizes the tone of both books.  Cramer's \\"How dare you?\\" is Engelberg's \\"Way to go, Joe!\\"<br />A key Cramer source is Barry Halper, noted memorabilia collector and Yankee limited Partner.  Cramer describes Halper's wife taking a cooking class in Europe just to cook Joe's favorite foods.  To Cramer, Joe was an ingrate that didn't appreciate all the Halpers were doing for him.<br />Engelberg describes Halper as a leech that was always trying to make money from Joe.  The essence of the relationship comes down to what happened to Joe's World Series rings that eventually Barry Halper possessed.  The authors argue about whether they were stolen from Joe's hotel room or sold by Joe on the sly.<br />Still, Joe comes off as somewhat aloof in both books.  Even Engelberg admits that Joe didn't appreciate him as much as he had wished, and even recounts his moodiness.  These admissions reinforce the charge that Joe hadn't much humility, but few people lodge this complaint against Muhammed Ali.<br />The book centers on DiMaggio's later years when Engelberg served him as lawyer and friend, but there is still plenty of stuff about his playing career and relationship with Marilyn.  The most offbeat passage is about Joe Jr. coming to live in his deceased father's house.  It's not always remembered that Joe Jr. was the last known person who spoke to Marilyn Monroe on the night of her death.  Junior tells Engelberg that Marilyn confessed her relationship with Bobby Kennedy and that she was going to come forward and expose them.  He's certain the Kennedys were behind her murder.  We've heard it before, but never from a source that close.<br />Engelberg says that he took no money from DiMaggio anytime in their friendship and I'd be interested in how Cramer would reconcile that with his account of Joe's later years.<br />Engelberg has a clear purpose in the book to clear the charges against him and to soften the image of DiMaggio painted by Cramer and it's largely successful.  Helped by veteran sportswriter, Marv Schneider, the book offers smooth prose and it flows well from beginning to end.  It's worth the time of any baseball fan.eat passage is about Joe Jr. coming to live in his deceased father's house.

You miss her great long prose in an interview like this, but you still get the insight in little capsules.<br />Most surprisingly is her love of the television show, Sex and the City.  She makes a good point about how TV shows filmed in New York like Law and Order and Sex and the City have better actors and guest stars because they can easily get them from New York theatre.<br />There's a funny moment in the story where the author tries to convince Kael to watch the independent movie CROUPIER.  He can't admit that he has already seen it, because Kael wouldn't hear of him watching it twice, she herself being famous for watching a movie just once.  Kael does later admit that she has seen just a few movies twice but it's rare.<br />Like always, Kael's movie taste surprises you.  She's always been good at pointing out the flaws of movies that you like, and sometimes forgiving of movies that you didn't get.  Here she sums her thoughts up with a sentence or two.  The book acts as a nice epilogue to an enjoyable career.	2004-01-29

Instead of wasting time with gossip, he offers solid and concise analysis of baseball, much of it unconventional.<br />He thinks that pitchers shouldn't be running before ballgames, because they are strengthening the wrong muscles.  Pitchers can best get in shape by pitching and conditioning the same muscles they will need when they are working late in a game.  He also thinks that pitchers should be throwing everyday to keep those muscles limber.  There must be something to it.  When Kaat retired, no one had played as many seasons and his only stint on the DL was when he broke his arm sliding into second base.<br />He also thinks that pitchers get into trouble over-thinking situations.  A good example is Mike Mussina, a Stanford graduate.  Kaat makes a good case that there is no substitute for throwing strikes.  He points out that even the best hitters can't hit every pitch out in batting practice when they know what's coming.  Why do pitchers worry that putting it across the plate is going to be disaster?  David Wells is his example of a guy who just battles the hitters with his best stuff.<br />The book is pretty short, because unlike most authors who go on and on about a subject hitting it at the edges, Kaat aims square in the middle and moves on to something else.  The publisher's worry about the book's shortness has lead to a bunch of filler material like Kaat's Teammate All-Star teams and greatest catchers he's seen.  There's also a section at the end full of newspaper stories written about Kaat during his playing career.<br />The main body of the book may be short, but the wisdom contained within is worth more than books twice the size.  I think Jim Kaat could write a really good book in the style of George Will's MEN AT WORK if some publisher gave him the opportunity.	2004-01-29

The story of Ted Williams is often told, but few have ever heard the story of Dom DiMaggio who was overshadowed by Williams and an even more famous older brother.  Doerr and Pesky are equally unexplored in most baseball stories.<br />Much like Lawrence Ritter's classic \\"The Glory of their Times\\", Teammates captures an era of old ballplayers which makes the modern game all the more rich.  But unlike Ritter's book that was more about an era, this is a story about how these players remained friends for nearly 50 years after they left the game.  Here you get the stories after retirement too, and they're just as interesting.<br />It's much shorter and more personal than Halberstam's other baseball books.  It doesn't get wrapped up in the games the way &quot;Summer of '49&quot; does.  While I personally prefer the latter, I enjoyed this a good deal and I'm not even a Red Sox fan.	2004-01-16

Since the media is a follow-the-leader game, once a frame takes hold it doesn't let go very easily.  Jamieson and Waldman use this theory mainly to explore the 2000 Election between Gore and Bush.<br />Gore's many misstatements through his political career led the press to frame him as dishonest.  Bush's flubs through his short political career convinced the press to put him in the frame of unintelligent.  The result were campaign stories that asked voters to choose between the smart, but untrustworthy Gore and the dumb but affable Bush.  The examples of media coverage in the book support this theory pretty well.<br />Next the authors cite the examples of Gore's untruths and basically defend each one as a misunderstanding, leaving Gore as a more honest individual than painted by the media.  As a reader, I anticipated the authors next explaining that Bush was actually a smarter man than he was given credit for, after all he has an MBA from Harvard.  Instead the authors quote a New Yorker article where a reporter cites George W. Bush's average grades at Yale.  This is was a surprise, because the story was unverified by Yale and it doesn't take into account that grades have much more to do with ambition and drive than intelligence.  There was no attempt to give Bush the same credit that the authors spent giving Gore.  An opportunity to support their main thesis was left on the floor, which gives one the feeling that the real purpose of the book is to defend Gore not shame the media.  This same pattern is repeated when the authors discuss the Florida recount.<br />It's unfortunate that Jamieson and Waldman abandon the scholarly for the advocacy role because there is a lot of other research in the book that seems dead on.  They bemoan that fact that reporters do a terrible job of verifying the evidence and drawing conclusions.  Instead, the authors argue that the media play into the &quot;he said, she said&quot; game of political strategy.  The story becomes about how the candidates disagree with each other on their positions more than the actual substance of those positions.  They also state that the media loves to play psychologist when they should instead be playing fact-finder.<br />I found the basic theories in the book supported by good evidence.  But the advocacy of Gore and the silence on Bush in the analysis sections detracted from the book's purported goal of exposing the media's laziness.  I'm sure that the authors would say that they had no intention of propping up Gore, but parts of the book seem to strengthen the media frame on Bush which weakens the overall argument of the book.  This is surprising since Bush could have been defended as easily as Gore.<br />Anyway, I think the authors do a fine job casting a spotlight on the media's &quot;follow the leader&quot; approach and that's enough recommend it despite my other misgivings.ence and drawing conclusions.

The authors' study of The Merchant of Venice and Othello both give readers an understanding of an outsider's role in a community while Julius Caesar and King Learn demonstrate that political power at the top is more tenuous than it many times appears.<br />Othello is an accepted member of Venice and is even a hero of sorts, but co-existence isn't full citizenship argue Bloom and Jaffa.  Citizenship in a homogenous society requires that one adhere to the same customs and even have the same background.  Othello may be a hero, but he's still an outsider.  Iago uses this insecurity to convince Othello that his wife is unfaithful.  Bloom and Jaffa certainly consider Othello a tragic figure of sorts, but he's one largely of his own making.  If Othello were to realize that he's incapable of being accepted totally in such a closed society he would have made better choices himself.  This would have kept him from making an enemy of the envious Iago.<br />Bloom and Jaffa also have a different take on the question of King Lear.  They think the most important political message occurs in the very first scene of the very first act.  While many consider Lear's idea of dividing his kingdom among his daughters the evidence of a foolish old man, the authors argue that Lear was a great king and only a great king could be guilty of such a terrible mistake.  No other English King in Shakespeare's writing was able to unite the whole British empire.  Shakespeare made this point up front so that you would realize what a great man King Lear is when the play opens.  It's important that Lear be seen as great not foolish, because when a great king makes the biggest mistake, the tragedy is all the more sorrowful.<br />You might not agree with every premise or conclusion in this book, but you'll certainly get to weigh the new ideas versus your own.  The result should be a better understanding of the Bard as a political animal.

That he gave up his potentially most productive years to fight in two wars says as much for his character as it does for his projected totals.  The biggest hurdle to recognition was his rascally personality that alienated hometown Boston sportswriters.<br />In a media age, it is very hard for accomplishments to be recognized without supporting prose.  But in Williams' case, his attitude not only cost him prose, but MVP votes from local sportswriters.  Had the hometown scribes written glowingly about his .406 average in 1941 the way the New York papers lionized DiMaggio's hitting streak, he may have won his first MVP.  Instead it took time for that accomplishment to be realized, and it continues to grow as the years pass without any .400 hitters.  Add the two Triple Crowns he won without getting the award and you have to wonder what sportswriters were doing with their votes.<br />Linn doesn't comment much on Williams' years as the manager of the Washington Senators.  It's just mentioned to say that Williams wasn't cut out to be a manager.  He says a little about Williams' service record, but reminds us that he was John Glenn's wingman.  And we get just enough about Williams home life to know that he wasn't the best husband.  This book isn't about those things it's about Williams the great hitter.<br />Linn stresses that Williams proved his greatness by the way he played when his tools were diminishing in the 1950s.  While the rest of his body was breaking down with injuries his bat could still light up a ballgame.  That he won the 1958 batting title at age of 39 is a feat that Linn says is amazing.  Linn makes a dramatic telling of his last at bat home run by explaining Williams before and after the contest.<br />This is an informative and thorough telling of Williams the ballplayer and a good choice if you want to know more about Williams and his era in the big leagues.and a good choice if you want to know more about Williams and his era in the big leagues.	2003-10-14

I wouldn't think a good pool hustler that could beat Minnesota Fats could also win the World Series of Poker.  I'm surprised that Slim could win thousands playing dominoes with Willie Nelson and also beat Bobby Riggs playing Ping Pong.  The one unifying factor is that Slim has had an amazing ability to figure out an edge against an opponent.  Once he can find an angle he can beat people at their best game.  The book provides numerous examples of how Slim has used that edge.<br />Brains have also kept Slim from harm.  He was more than willing to risk a misdemeanor to run his Texas Bookmaking business, but when Federal Law made bookmaking a felony, Slim immediately quit the business whereas his friend Sailor was stubborn and eventually went to jail.<br />There's a good amount of material about run-ins with Slim's nemesis Jimmy the Greek.  Slim didn't like the Greek.  Some of it was due to the Greek's inflated ego and iffy character, and though some explanation is provided it seems that the reasons for the animosity go deeper than the basic descriptions.  I bet a whole book could be written on their associations.<br />What Slim doesn't do in the book is explain big bets that he lost.  There isn't any reflection on the times people have outsmarted him.  I'm sure very few have, but it would have been interesting to hear Slim explain what he learned from those events.<br />The book flows nicely and I laughed I quite a bit at Slim's down home witticisms.  If you like gambling or the people who do, this book will provide an entertaining afternoon at the beach.	2003-09-28

He does a fine job making his own case, but he seems to approach the material from a different set of premises than those who decry the bias.  Alterman lists the areas of the media like talk radio that are dominated by conservatives. He then names all the famous conservative pundits on political shows. He also examines the number of conservative think tanks like the Heritage Foundation.<br />He doesn't refute or even examine the conservative point that talk radio thrives simply because conservative ideas weren't getting play anywhere else.  Alterman is also troubled that more TV pundits are conservative, and though I can name more conservative pundits too, Alterman goes further. He also lists Democratic pundits like Morton Kondracke and Christopher Mathews as conservatives. Cokie Roberts, the daughter of a Democratic House member, is a conservative. He even suggests that David Broder is a conservative.<br />He quotes Broder quite thoroughly praising Reagan's approach while criticizing Clinton's. What he doesn't address is Broder's almost religious faith in the Federal Government and politicians to solve people's problems. I remember reading Broder's criticism of term limits. Broder couldn't imagine how anything would get done in Washington without a permanent political class to run things.<br />But Broder criticized Clinton for his methods and that makes Broder conservative.  He doesn't imagine that liberals like Broder were frustrated that an engaging President missed an opportunity to promote liberalism, because of his own character flaws. It's the same reason Broder might like Reagan's style, wishing a liberal could turn up with such good political instincts. Never once does Alterman quote Broder's praise of Reagan's tax cut or military buildup. He only shows Broder praising the politician.<br />When it comes to economics, Alterman uses NAFTA as an example of how big media is economically conservative, but to attack NAFTA would have put the media to the left of Bill Clinton. What Alterman doesn't mention is that the media constantly derides supply side economics. The fact that every major news anchor and player in the media speaks of tax cuts in terms of what they cost is a great example of liberal bias. Ignoring that tax cuts spur growth and create a larger amount of revenue never gets any play either among the big fish. Not once after Reagan's tax cut in the 1980s did the government take in less tax revenue than the year prior. How often is that reported? The idea that taxes are actually the citizen's money is never explored on the big three networks either.<br />The argument that these big corporations are controlling the mouths of the media is mentioned, but no where demonstrated in the book.  Brent Bozell's Cyber Alert newsletter is packed everyday with 4-6 examples of Major Media hosts taking the liberal line and Alterman doesn't once address Jennings, Rather and Brokaw, Couric, or Gumbel. To him, the media is George Will's 15 minutes at the end of the George Stephonopolis show.<br />He explores the Heritage Foundation and Talk Radio, but it would seem obvious to me that these entities exist and thrive because they are a counter to the everyday media as we know it. Would there be any reason to listen to Sean Hannity if Peter Jennings were saying the same things? Would we need a Heritage Foundation if the New York Times were espousing personal liberty over equality? Would we need George Will if George Stephanopolis hadn't spent his career working for Democrats? Regardless of the number of well-known conservative pundits, it must be apparent that they are labeled conservative because their presence is to counter the opinions coming from the &quot;mainstream&quot; person.<br />Is the New York Time liberal to Alterman?  No.  The NATION magazine alone is liberal in America, Alterman concludes. That's like saying the John Birch magazine, THE NEW AMERICAN is the only conservative voice in America.<br />His justification is that the whole continent of Europe is to the left of America and plenty of liberal magazines like the NATION thrive there. I would say that neither the NATION nor most of Europe is liberal. They are socialists, just like the NEW AMERICAN people are isolationists. Both magazines are fringe elements that are ignored and not influential among policy makers. If you spent a day reading both magazines, you wouldn't be surprised at how much they are opposed diametrically, but it might surprise you to find them in total agreement on trade issues and the like. They complete the circle, if you will, by being on the fringe.<br />How many Democratic Party positions can you name that aren't supported by the mainstream press?  I have trouble naming any.  Alterman makes a good case that the media isn't totally socialist, but his refusal to engage the specific criticisms that come from conservatives must mean that he has yielded those points.  If you believe the Democratic Party is conservative, then Alterman's thesis is correct.<br />Alterman has laid out a good foundation that the media isn't liberal enough and I never tired of his examples and excellent writing, but until he spends some time answering Brent Bozell and conservative critics directly, he hasn't made the strongest case for his side.man concludes.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Great suspense the whole way through	Some of the best-written books are nonfiction written by novelists.  It allows the reader to absorb a real story that has added weight with the benefit of a narrative to make it dramatic.  These elements are the key to the success of Bringing Down the House.<br />The entire opening is a mini drama in itself, maybe the blackjack equivalent of Indiana Jones trying to get the idol at the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Without knowing any of the story we are put into the setting of a young man named Kevin carrying a million dollars trying to escape a casino before the managers take him downstairs followed by the drama of whether the protagonist can get the cash money through airport security.<br />When we catch our breath we start to get the linear story of how our hero came to be where he was that night.  The book speaks to two powerful desires within us.  The first is the rebellious longing to outsmart authority and the second is the desire to use our wits to get rich.<br />The plan was genius in construction but easy in operation.  Counting cards has never been difficult and it's perfectly legal, but it's so easily spotted by pit bosses that players get barred for trying it.  That's the trade-off.  How long can someone count cards and make money before they are found out and asked to never return?  I won't ruin their scheme, because it's part of the genius of the book.<br />What's great about the book is not just the plan itself but the many experiences our hero lives as he achieves his goals.  He meets celebrities, stays in the best suites for free and gets great seats to the biggest boxing matches of the year.  He lives the life of a gilded age Diamond Jim in a Las Vegas suite on the weekend, only to return to his rundown dorm during the week.<br />Like all biographies are really longings within us to improve our own lives, Bringing Down the House demonstrates that raw ability can yield results with the proper discipline and effort, even when the methods and tactics aren't universally supported.  Imagine what this brainwork could be doing in the realm of cold fission.s and tactics aren't universally supported.

His basic argument is that left-wing snobs in Washington and academia have ignored youth culture instead of reaching out to it.  Goldberg feels that this error has caused the Democrats many elections including the Presidential election of 2000.<br />He spends the largest part of the book disagreeing with Tipper Gore about her campaign to label rock music, and Joe Lieberman about his attacks on Hollywood and entertainment.  He points out that Bill Clinton won the youth vote in 1996 by 19 points, because Bob Dole spent so much time attacking Hollywood, but with Lieberman and Gore on the ticket in 2000, the youth vote was evenly divided between them and Bush.  Just a small percentage of that vote in the Democrats direction would have turned that election around.<br />Goldberg makes some good points about how politicians have been veering close to censorship with their hand-wringing and committee hearings, and grandstanding.  As a member of the ACLU and the music industry, Goldberg fears the infringement of the first amendment.  He feels that the biggest problem for progressives is a dominant leftwing snobbery that is more interested in bland academic liberalism than the raw energetic rebellion of youth culture.<br />Goldberg's defense of the first amendment is as articulate as I've heard in the discussion, but he seems like his own worst enemy.  While arguing that politicians are spending too much time attacking first amendment freedoms, he encourages politicians to attack second amendment freedoms.  When Congress says that explicit material should be policed, Goldberg suggests that it's really guns that are dangerous.  This is a mistake for two reasons.<br />First, Goldberg is saying that the artistic youth music and culture speaks to a great many people, but even the most explicit calls for sex and violence do nothing to influence youngsters.  On the other hand, guns attached to no call for action cause people to do horrible things.  History has always shown that ideas have greater consequences than armaments.  Did the German arsenal cause World War II or was it the demagoguery of Hitler?<br />Second, by arguing to halt second amendment freedoms, Goldberg yields politicians the moral authority to halt first amendment freedoms.  This is a big mistake, because the only argument you can make against censorship is a constitutional one.  If the constitution can be ignored because of a popularly perceived danger, then it can be ignored anytime a crafty politician sees a ready voting block.<br />I think this is why Goldberg argues it's in the best interests of leftists to embrace popular culture.  Since he has little faith in the original intent of the constitution he can only win the heart of worried liberals by demonstrating to them an untapped voting block, the young.  This way they can still tinker with the constitution in ways that he approves of, but they won't mess with an industry that is close to his heart.  But the idea that we can just convince politicians that rock music is bland but guns are dangerous isn't going to protect our rights in the long run.<br />I don't think he can win over the politicians he is trying to reach, because most kids cannot vote and all parents can.  The fact that liberals like the Gores and Liebermans were worried about their own kids is a sign that all children rebel in some form and even liberal parents are somewhat fearful of it.  And since all parents can vote, politicians on the Right and Left are going to pander to the biggest voting block.  Clinton may have won more of the youth vote in 1996, but he truly liked pop culture and he didn't have to worry about angering parents because Perot was there to chew up Reagan Democrats and other independents.<br />The Gore campaign realized that traditional blue collar Democrats crossed the lines and voted Republicanin 1980, 1984, 1988.  Without the benefit of a rightwing challenger like Ross Perot in 2000, Gore would have to win a bigger percentage of white middle class voters to succeed.  A few percentage points of parents vote was worth more than a few percentage points of youth vote.<br />Despite some disagreements, I leaned that I have a lot more in common with fellow citizens like Goldberg than politicians that share my views.  Both Goldberg and I want our leaders to be driven by ideas and idealism, but they are really driven by winning elections.  Thus, we're both frustrated by politicians that will trade our rights to pander to a voting block.  I only wish I could convince Goldberg to join me in the protection of all constitutional freedoms.  That unity, I think, is the only way we can keep the opportunists from selling us out for their own empowerment.<br />Anyway, I was happy to read a well argued book from a fellow citizen even if we don't agree on conclusions.ted Republican in 1980, 1984, 1988.

No one takes the conventional progressive orthodoxy and exposes it better than he does.  Take these quotes for instance:<br />We seem to be getting closer and closer to a situation where nobody is responsible for what they did but we are all responsible for what somebody else did.<br />The people I feel sorry for are those who insist on continuing to do what they have always done but want the results to be different from what they have always been.<br />There may be a lot of people who feel like he does, but few can express it so well.  I was happy to finally get to read his memoir and it's much different than the witticisms in his column.  The book is a very earnest account of the challenges of growing up and not knowing how to use one?s abilities.  Sowell was brilliant even as a kid, but his family wasn?t supportive and he was too rebellious to get along well in school.  After a working a while, and a stint in the Marines, Sowell was able to find his center and educate himself.  He does this without the benefit of his family or Affirmative Action, which he opposes.<br />I think he's as interesting writer because he's always in conflict with authority.  This happened in public school, the Marines, in college, the Labor Department, and when he taught at Cornell University.  It still continues.  Sowell just refuses to live to the polite standards of modern enlightenment when they are illogical.<br />It would have been easy for a man of Sowell?s intellect to play the game and become a black leader as powerful as Jesse Jackson is.  Not being conventional has cost him many opportunities in his life, but it has gained him his self-respect, individualism and new opportunities.<br />The moral of the story is that you can choose to trade your soul for riches or you can enrich your soul with your own integrity.  The former results in therapy the later brings peace of mind.	2003-09-05

Positively Fifth Street is one of those rare nonfiction books that read like a great first person novel.  It doesn't hurt that McManus follows in the gonzo tradition of Hunter Thompson on his journey.  The book begins with McManus a professor and freelance writer who is hired to write a story on how women are appearing more and more at the World Series of Poker and how women are becoming more visible in the game. But this is no ordinary World Series, because the Binion family that has run the event every year since its founding is distracted by the murder trial of sibling, Ted Binion.  And to top it off, author, narrator, Jim McManus is also a bit of a poker player himself.<br />Jim wants to enter the tournament with his writing advance, but he doesn't have enough money.  He has two college aged children and two young children at home and nothing but bills.  With all of the tension of the story Jim is sent to cover, his own personal tensions slowly become the center of the book, especially after he enters the tournament and goes up against famous players, including the author of Jim's favorite tournament book, TJ Cloutier.<br />I found the writing very immediate like a conversation that happens immediately after the event.  I also found the tension internal and external was enough to sustain the multiple storylines.  McManus seems to end each section of commentary at a natural conclusion and this makes the transitions easy to follow.  I enjoyed Alvarez' great history ONLY GAME IN TOWN and found Anthony Holden's BIG DEAL quite interesting, but neither was as fun to read for me as POSITIVELY FIFTH STREET.<br />This is the kind of book that you can enjoy regardless of your poker knowledge.  It may even convince you to take up the game.	2003-08-31

Bill was quite personable and gracious in his personal dealings with the Colonel, while Hillary was every bit the witch you might think.  I most enjoyed the contrast between the trips where Bill was by himself eating barbecue and yukking it up with his friends on Air Force One, and those times that Hillary was aboard and the journey was somber with salads and little laughter.<br />I wonder what's in those file boxes that Hillary brings on every trip, thought the colonel.  Could they be the missing files that the court was looking for?  They certainly traveled everywhere she did.  No explanation, though.  I guess we'll just have to wonder.<br />The colonel was only with the Clinton's for a few years, but was able to suffer the indignity of being made caddy to Hillary's fat Rodham brothers on several occasions.  In fact, most of Clinton's friends expected military officers to tote golf clubs.  The Colonel was also around when Bill sexually harassed an attractive female military officer.  Still waiting to hear the outrage from NOW or Anita Hill.<br />Most importantly, Patterson saw firsthand how little regard Clinton had for National Security.  The things that Clinton could have done in the 90s to prevent 911 can only be speculated on, but Patterson fills in some of the blanks.  He offers specific moments like when the President was too busy watching golf to bomb the bad guys.<br />The book is short and quick to read and worth an afternoon.	2003-08-28

While it is presented as entertaining poker memoir, it's also a lesson on how to be a better player.  As I was reading and laughing at his stories and characters, I noticed he would slip in situations that asked the reader to consider strategy.  It's the same strategy you might find in a Sklansky book, but Bellin gives you a better feel for actually being at the table and trying to make the decision.  For example. . .<br />He talks about Rich who had a good job and a good wife, but lost everything, because he couldn't fold a hand.  He had to play everything to the river.  Who hasn't been tempted to play anything to end a losing streak?  That's the genius of his book.  It was an interesting story and a cautionary tale about foolish play.<br />Between anecdotes he slips in the advice that it's tough to get back to even after you've lost half your money.  Life is really just one big poker game.  Forget whether this one session is successful.  It's better to leave a game that isn't working and make your money in a future game that suits your style of play.  He also advises that having a cap on winnings is foolish for the same reasons.  Why can't you win a ton in one session?<br />Bellin talks about check raising and pot odds and position and all the things that the instructional books talk about, but he offers these things in the format of situations he has encountered.  Also he shares many great stories of famous and not famous players and how different people come to play poker for fun or for a living.  The book is not only quick and fun to read, but it offers some great advice between the lines.	2003-08-11

Some moderately valuable diamonds were stolen and the Continental Op is put on the case to find the culprit.  Not soon after, the Op learns that something larger is going on.  The family he is investigating has some deep secrets and maybe even a curse follows them.  The story takes place in three parts with three different mysteries, but they culminate to solve the Dain Curse, which is at the center of all the action.<br />I was introduced to the Continental Op a few years ago in short story form and loved the character quite a bit.  I've been saving the novels for a few years and it was worth the wait.  Hammett became famous for Sam Spade and the Thin man, but the Continental Op is deserving of more attention.  He's not typically handsome and he's even short and fat, but he has enough brains an no how to get the job done.<br />A shame that Hammett got sucked into revolutionary politics and spent the last 30 years of his life writing nothing of value, because his early stuff is nothing less than Great American Literature.	2003-07-19
US	52888137	R2P3537GJAHDIE	0679722610	645212410	Red Harvest	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Vastly Underrated!	This was the first novel featuring Hammett's short story character, The Continental Op, and it's well worth reading.  The Op is sent from his home in San Francisco to Personville, Montana on the request of a client.  The fact that Personville is pronounced posionville by its residents will tell you the kind of town he enters.  The violence is so bad that the Op never actually sees his client alive, but he sticks around to avenge his death.  The deep plot is as convoluted as any detective novel, but the basic plot of a man playing two sides against each other proved to be important in the history of film even more so than literature.<br />The Op was the original Man With No Name.  Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Western borrows both the stranger concept and the plot from Red Harvest.  Though the credit is usually given to Akira Kurosawa for his film Yojimbo, both films actually borrow their essence from Hammett.<br />It's not necessary to have seen either film to enjoy this story.  Overshadowed by the classic Maltese Falcon, Red Harvest deserves more ink than it gets.  It's here with Hammett that the noir detective novel was born.  The romantic notion of a poor detective who would rather live up to his own standards of justice than take a big payoff is a very American outlook.  I can only figure that such a character comes from the many assignments that Hammett got working for the Pinkerton detective agency and the many times that Hammett wasn't allowed to do the right thing.  Our detective is so virtuous under the standards of his own ethics that you admire him even when he is creating a bloodbath.<br />The most surprising thing is how well the whole book flows and quickly I read it.  Hammett has a great way of leaving each chapter with enough questions that you want to immediately read the next one.  He'll leave you with the conclusion of a boxing match and with a fighter that falls over with a knife in his back.  How can you go to sleep on a chapter like that?<br />Any fan of detective novels and film noir should do themselves the justice of reading all the Hammett they can get.  Red Harvest is a good start to that goal.Any fan of detective novels and film noir should do themselves the justice of reading all the Hammett they can get.

There are two main characters and they take turns writing chapters.  The first is fictitious sportswriter, Luther Pond looking back at his career from the perspective of the 1970s.  The other character is real-life Black Sox player, Buck Weaver and his experiences in baseball before and after the scandal that rocked baseball.<br />The book is billed as a novel about the Black Sox, but it's not just an account of that season, but a reflection of the careers of two men who wound up in the middle of that notorious event.<br />Luther Pond begins his story as a cub reporter covering the famous boxer, John L. Sullivan, who himself is covering a big boxing match featuring the first black heavyweight champion, Jack Johnson.  Pond learns that Sullivan is now fat and alcoholic and doesn't even write his own copy for the newspaper.  Pond goes on to demolish the legend of other athletes too by digging into Ty Cobb's past and uncovering information that suggests he also had his hand in fixing ballgames.<br />Buck Weaver is portrayed as a young cocky player who passivity gets him caught up in situations not of his making.  Ultimately it gets him kicked out of baseball.<br />What really made the book work for me is that Stein writes with a style that is somewhere between Ring Lardner and Damon Runyon, two men who were both sportswriters at this time, but would later go on to greater glory through their fiction.  For me that style captures the time as well as the story.<br />Some books you enjoy all the way through and some you enjoy more in reflection.  Hoopla is definitely one you'll enjoy all the way to the finish.	2003-05-11
US	52888137	R10OCDA8ZQDIO9	0375708618	474910652	The Supreme Court	Books	4	38	38	N	N	Excellent short history of the court	As an introduction to the history of the Supreme Court, Justice Rehnquist's book was just what I was looking for. Not only does he give a good explanation of the personalities and issues through the ages, he also explains the experience of being a clerk on the court.<br />Rehnquist begins by telling the story of how he came to be a clerk for Justice Jackson in the early 1950s. He then goes back and explains the origins of the court in the 19th century. From 1800 until the Civil War, only two men were chief Justice, John Marshall and Roger Taney. Rehnquist explains why both of these men were important and how they shaped the court for generations to come.<br />Rehnquist then explains that the next 100 years were without an important chief justice, but many significant associate justices. This period begins with cases like Plessy v. Ferguson and ends with Brown versus the Board of Education. Rehnquist does a good job of explaining the politics behind FDR's court packing plan in the 1930s, and the Steel Case that came before the court when he was a clerk in the early 1950s.<br />The book ends with how the process of deciding cases happens on the Supreme Court, and how Rehnquist's experience was different as an associate justice before he became the chief.<br />The book works as an excellent history and an insider's view to how the court operates. It's not an in-depth book, but I don't know a single volume could accomplish that. I was very happy with what I learned in 300 pages.	2003-04-28

We all know people with average intelligence that find decent success by performing mundane tasks, studying endless bland materials, and rising slowly through an organization.  Well, Frank Abagnale wasn't one of them.  He wanted to make money fast, and at the age of 16 he started his career as a prolific con man with numerous schemes and identities.  Abagnale tried a little of everything.  He posed as an airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, and college professor, but he made most of his money with counterfeit checks.  The funniest part is that he did it all to pick up girls.<br />The descriptive book tells a great story about a man who found weaknesses in a system and exploited them.  Tired of routine, Frank was constantly thinking up brand new schemes and they all worked.  He even had a good hunch as to when something was getting dangerous and he would move on.  His incredible run lasted four years and his memories of capture and imprisonment are just as compelling.<br />I was a big fan of the movie last year, but the book tells a different but equally interesting story.  The movie was full of composite characters and a parallel story between con man and FBI agent.  The book is just a straightforward telling of how one man fooled the system.  It's well written.  You should fly through it in no time.	2003-04-22

Franny is a college age kid who thinks that a constant prayer is the only way to find God.  Zooey is her older and wiseacre brother who has some thoughts on that topic.<br />Their family structure is a precursor to the family in the ROYAL TENEBAUMS, if you've seen the movie.  The book is sharp and funny and even insightful.  It would make a good stage play as most of the book is dialogue and it takes place in just two settings.<br />If you are reading it as a follow up to CATCHER IN THE RYE, you'll get a different experience here.  It is more talky whereas CATCHER was more of an adventure.  I enjoyed Franny and Zooey, but probably more so after I had finished reading it.	2003-04-03

If you were a Brooklyn Dodger fan in the 1950s your team was decidedly first division, but your hopes would always die with the Yankees in the World Series.  Wait Until Next Year!<br />The descriptions of her father's sad upbringing and the loss of her mother make this a coming of age tale as much as a baseball one.  Baseball was a way for Doris to relate to her father and have identity in her neighborhood of Giants and Yankees fans.  As a young girl she would listen to the Brooklyn Dodger games and keep score to show her father later.  She would hang out at the Butcher Shop and gloat to the butcher when her Dodgers beat his Giants.<br />As she grew up, she would see baseball change mirrored in social change.  Baseball allowed her favorite player Jackie Robinson to play in 1947, and some years later President Eisenhower ensured the schools of Little Rock would also be colorblind.  Like a good novel, the Dodgers did eventually win the World Series in 1955.  And, of course, the Dodgers would leave Brooklyn as young Doris Kearns shed childhood for adolescence.<br />In some ways I wish the book was more about baseball and less a memoir, but I was thrilled that a young girl in the 1950s would have the same experiences and excitement growing up with baseball as I did in the 1970s.  For those who truly understand and love America's game, this book is worth your time.	2003-03-02

That this book fell off the radar screen when Bob Woodward published his book, BUSH AT WAR, is too bad, because Sammon's book is really worthwhile.  I had thought that I would have to lumber through this thing to find bits and pieces of interesting information, but his story is so well told that I sped through it faster than expected..<br />The book begins on September 10th where Bush is staying in Florida so that he can address a group of schoolchildren the next morning.  Here Sammon describes the regular operations of a President, traveling the country to campaign for education.  He then describes the entire day of September 11th from Bush's vantage.  How the president got up in the morning to jog, to the drive through a bad section of town to the school, to the moment he learned of the second plane hitting the trade center.  Then he tells us about how James Carville and other strategy Democrats learned of the disaster, followed by Osama Bin Laden's brief bio and notorious past.  He even goes into detail about Bob Beckwith, the firefighter that Bush stood next to at Ground Zero.  The book then continues on into the summer of 2002 just before it looked likely that Iraq would be the next target.<br />Since Bill Sammon works for one of the few conservative papers in the country, the Washington Times, the book is really good at showing the folly of the mainstream press throughout the early days of the conflict.  There are some great stories about how the newsmen are already calling Afghanistan a quagmire 3 weeks into the fighting.  The book simply flows very well and is hard to put down.  I figured I'd like it because it wasn't an attack piece, but I was surprised at how positive the entire book is.  Sammon reveals a President that will do whatever it takes to beat the bad guys and protect American freedom.  In short, he reminds us of the Bush that everyone admired after September 11th and thankfully the Bush that most of us still admire today.	2003-02-16

I hope that cannot be said about 1984.  I was assigned this book back in high school, and with apologies to Mr. Johnson, I read the Cliffs Notes instead.  But since I am unable to discard a book, especially a classic, I have spent the ensuing years having it stare me back in the face. While the totalitarian warnings are well known and the 1984 terminology is widely used, I just couldn't believe how gripping the whole thing is.  The main character, Winston Smith is no abstraction.  He's easy to identify with.  Suddenly totalitarianism isn't some far off gulag or death camp, but the horrors of a man alone.<br />The thoughts and details are slowly revealed in a way that you can really root for Winston.  As he learns more about a world he scarcely remembers as ever being different, you hope that he is about to change everything.  What does happen is a pretty good secret considering how much has already been written about this book.  I've read other Orwell books since High School, but I'll admit that I was scared of 1984's classic nature.  I shouldn't have been.  Orwell was always easy to understand.  His insistence on using straightforward language to convey complex issues makes the book easy to follow.  Now, I regret that I will never have the pleasure of reading it again for the first time.	2003-01-28

First, I was surprised that Franklin spent the majority of his retired life living in Europe.  As an architect of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, I had always thought that Franklin was close at hand during America's founding, but instead Franklin tended to American business overseas.  He just happened to be around during the creation and signing of the two crucial American Documents.<br />What's great about Brands' biography is that he presents the story of the human Franklin without sinking to iconoclasm.  Since it is so unfashionable to paint a compelling portrait of a known hero when you can instead make him out to be a vain phony self-promoter and greedy to boot, I was very happy that H.W Brands saw good in Franklin.  That being said, Brands portrait is still an objective one leaving in the kinds of details that Franklin would have left out.  As far as style, Franklin's own words leap off the page and Brands narrative is more straightforward.  Since Franklin's autobio ends just where his life gets most interesting, I was very happy with the way Brands presents the rest of the story.	2003-01-26

Mostly, the book is a rebuttal of those in the autuer camp who have considered Huston to be an empty suit.  The early part of the book admits that Huston may have no clear visual style, but certainly a thematic one.  The constant theme running through his films is the masculine identity against the world.  From there, several scholars examine films and groups of films searching for the Huston perspective.<br />The essays themselves are varied.  The first section considers his ideology.  Here writers examine his WWII documentaries, THE RED BAD OF COURAGE,  TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE and the obscure WE WERE STRANGERS among others.<br />Part two considers the Huston take on masculinity examining such films as THE MALTESE FALSON, MOULIN ROUGE, and REFLECTIONS IN THE GOLDEN EYE.  The book wraps with an interview, some biographical sketches and even a few John Huston short stories that were written before his film career.<br />Through the book nearly every major Huston film is considered and examined, sometimes by more than one author.  It's a great book for film scholars, though casual filmgoers may get bogged down in the arguments and footnotes.	2002-12-31

The books are short and his points are direct.  When you see the size of his books you first think that there isn't much to them, but it isn't long before you recant.  I was somewhere near page five when I realized that I was considering the world from an entirely different introspection.  Johnson explains how literature, myths and even ancient stories are consistent with overall human nature.  By explaining the meaning of classic stories, Johnson explains the dilemmas of mankind, how they are timeless and universal.<br />In Transformations, Johnson explains how the masculine psyche begins as a Don Quixote, progresses into a Hamlet, and seeks to become a Faust.  Some people live their whole lives without making it, but they do cause themselves a lot of trouble along the way.  Johnson doesn't offer a solution but a path to take to find your own way.<br />Maybe the most comforting thing in these books is the idea that we're all struggling to get somewhere and we're not in it alone.  It certainly helps my understanding of those I've come into conflict with.	2002-12-28

It's Los Angeles in the early 1950s with  plenty of organized crime and questionable police tactics.  The just of the story is in the first page, Mickey Cohen the gangster that runs Los Angeles is going to prison which leaves a vacuum in the city.  The rest of the book is figuring out who is trying to take over his rackets.  The fun of the book is watching the characters battle to figure it out.<br />As is usually my wont, I read the book because I liked the movie so much.  And with many great movies that are books, LA Confidential is just more of a good thing.  The same main characters and a couple of interesting tertiary ones roll through Los Angles with a show horse of justice, though ambition and corruption are the real guiding factor.<br />Having seen the movie doesn't ruin the book, because the book is enough different to keep you wondering and Ellroy is such a good writer that you'll enjoy even the familiar dialogue.  This is the kind of book that makes guys want to read books.	2002-11-01

Well the English government turned to everyone, hoping that some budding scientist could figure out the problem of calculating Longitude at sea.  They even offered a huge reward.  Why was it important?  Without precise longitude, there was no way to steer a ship with any precision.  Thus English ships were being wrecked and precious cargo wasn't making its scheduled delivery.<br />The scientists worked and worked on the problem.  Many men including Edmund Halley thought that by mapping the stars, one could use the night sky as a map at sea.  Although he knew little about science, a simple clockmaker named John Harrison thought that well-built clock with a dual face would solve the problem.  You get to guess which person was right.<br />Longitude is both a vibrant story of the pains of solving an important problem, and a biography of the man who solved it.  I don't tend to read the subject of science all that much, because I find it dry, but not so with this book.  Author Dava Sobel lends an understanding of the human element in science.  That Harrison has to fight snobbery first and later jealousy demonstrates how ego and self-importance can get in the way of the most important problems facing human beings.  Not only will you learn how average people can solve enormous tasks, but you'll nod as the familiar self-promoters try to take the credit.	2002-10-13

I find that I don't have time to cook, and there are plenty of places in town that are cheap and good.  There was a time after reading George Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London that eating out brought up bad visions.  It's happened once again with Anthony Bourdain's informative and often times hilarious book, Kitchen Confidential.<br />We know that restaurants are dirtier than our own kitchens, but Bourdain explains what to look for when choosing a sanitary eating environment.  He suggests that restaurant food is better during the weekdays when a chef is preparing food for what he believes to be his regular customers, whereas weekend food is for tourists and has to be rushed by the nature of the crowds.  To hear Bourdain tell it, Sunday Brunch is the absolute worst time to eat anywhere, because the main chef is off and the food is mostly stale bread and other leftovers from throughout the week.<br />The book really serves as an autobiography of how Bourdain came to be a chef and his experiences up to the present day.  To hear him tell it, the kitchen is full of characters. He describes many of these nuts that have filled his life, and their exploits from past to present.  Some of these people are so antisocial in Bourdain's opinion that they would be hardly functional anywhere but a kitchen.  He describes a baker so doped up that he frequently missed work for a week, but he'd be welcomed back, because his bread was like no other.  In the same vein, it's not an exaggeration to say the author refers to (maybe even brags about) his own ... habit at least 20 times.<br />Bourdain does seem to have a knack for the kind of self-effacing promotion that is so popular these days with audiences.  Here's a guy that is a high paid chef at a well-known restaurant, but much of the story is about his screw-ups and feeble attempts at making a living.  His style is hard-hitting like a noir detective novel.  You'll know after 10 pages whether you'll enjoy the book.  I did.s whether you'll enjoy the book.  I did.	2002-08-12

The works in this particular volume are a compilation of Mitchell's newspaper stories from the 1930s.  While Mitchell's prose is sharp and illuminating, the subject matter comes off as slight compared to Mitchell's other labors.  Mitchell had such a reputation for wanting his magazine stories to be perfect that these newspaper stories have the sense of being rushed to the presses.<br />Having said that, there are some great moments in the book.  The book has a nice profile section of 1930s cartoonists, which is just the kind of subject matter that Mitchell handles well in that it gets past the part that everyone sees to the part Mitchell wants to know about.  The section on Voodoo is hysterical and very much like his later New Yorker work.  The book ends with a funny profile of playwright George Bernard Shaw.<br />If you have never read Mitchell, start with UP IN THE OLD HOTEL, but if you are already a fan, there are enough gems in this collection to make it worth your while.	2002-07-31

Her husband (Henry) is the first man, but he isn't much of a lover.  Her lover (Bendrix) is the second, but he isn't much of a man.  The story is told from the POV of Bendrix and he goes on about how much he hates everything.  Sarah left him and he's hurt to no end.  Bendrix imagines all of the other men she is now seeing, and it makes him mad with rage.  As the book unfolds, we learn that every ounce of Bendrix' hate was once measured by an equal amount of passionate love for Sarah.  Maybe the natural end of a jealous foolish lover, but the book is really about a whole lot more.<br />Specifically, the book is about the power of God and the argument of whether God actually touches and influences our lives or whether he sits on the sidelines idly.  Most of the characters in the book don't believe in God or violently try to disbelieve.  They cling to the notion that God can neither be proved nor disproved.  As the book progresses, Greene puts his characters into subtle situations that show the hand of God in their lives.  The characters do all they can to cling to the rationalism that will explain it all away.  Sarah feels the real spirit of God, but she wants to disprove him to enjoy life.  Henry is just plain rational and unromantic, he doesn't see anything.  Bendrix is a flame of passion and he comes to hate God for all of his troubles, while refusing to admit his existence.<br />Oddities occur and are uneasily explained away by Bendrix as mere coincidences.  The result is that the reader is challenged to examine the unexplainable situations in their own lives.  How many times has something happened to us that we've belittled that may have had a divine origin?  Greene has done a tremendous job using beautiful writing and characters to make us examine ourselves.<br />This was my first attempt at reading Greene, and I would recommend it as a good first choice.  It's relatively short, and it can also be read in conjunction with viewing the well-done 1999 film of the same name.with viewing the well-done 1999 film of the same name.	2002-03-30

Noonan's style is the usual graceful and insightful and with Reagan she picks her perfect subject. I wasn't a big fan of Peggy Noonan's anti-Hilary written in 2000, because her style seems all wrong for a hatchet job. Barbara Olsen was much better at attacking the Clintons. With Reagan, Noonan is back to her strength.<br />Noonan starts way back with Reagan's Tampico, Illinois upbringing, but she doesn't get stranded in a childhood like so many other biographers tend to do. She makes her points and moves on. This she does all through the book. She gracefully takes us through his Hollywood Period to his TV Period to his Political Period with perfect anecdotes and clever jokes. Her description of Reagan's assassination was the best account I have ever read. I think that this book is the most seminal short biography of Ronald Reagan. If you have never read a book on Reagan, this is your best first choice.	2002-02-14

Rabbit has a heart condition and he's not doing anything to improve his health.  His son Nelson has grown into a wreck of an adult, to which Harry and his wife deserve the lion share of the blame.  The parents are so old and respectable now, you forget what they put their son through, until he reminds them.  You really want to root for Harry to overcome all of the obstacles he faces, like you root for charming outlaws to outrun the posse.  You sense that Zeus and the Gods are sitting on Mt. Olympus using Harry Angstrom as their plaything.  Despite the fact that Updike is given literature status (this book won the Pulitzer), it's very easy to get into.  This isn't long and arduous James Joyce prose, but an easy to follow modern day story that will make you think.  The series is either a scathing indictment of latter 20th Century middle-class America that invents their own agony or it's just Updike's view of how normal people live.  Whichever, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys serious fiction.	2002-01-31

The book itself is a collection of interviews Cassavetes gave through his entire life, edited into chapters that correspond to the movies he talked about.  The excerpts themselves are pretty interesting, but it is author Ray Carney's commentary in between quotes that really makes this book worthwhile.  Carney gives us the back story, and fills in the missing parts, but he also sets things straight when John rambles into fiction.  It's easy to see that Cassavetes liked to talk about his work.  There are over 500 pages on roughly a dozen films.<br />If you are new to Cassavetes and read this book, you'll want to view his films.  I have only seen a handful myself, but his total commitment to getting them made is so impressive that I feel ashamed to have not seen more.  I saw my first Cassavetes film in college and felt that it was interesting, but a little over the top in places.  As I get older, I think that real-life might be more over the top than I first realized.<br />John Cassavetes passion for making movies shines through in this volume.  Ray Carney's insight tells the rest of the story.  If you are interested in independent film making, this book is a must.	2002-01-10

Those in the rock world largely denounced this book, and for all I know it may be hooey, but boy was it a page-turner.  It works largely because the events and descriptions seem consistent with what we already know of the Beatles and Rock &amp; Roll in general.  The private descriptions of Lennon and all of the Beatles seem to match their public persona just enough that you nod your head.<br />The Goldman assessment that Lennon's Beatles evolved into Paul's Beatles as John grew tired of the intricacies of music production is in step with other things we've read about the band.  We know that Sergeant Pepper was a Paul creation, but Goldman contends that Lennon never put in enough effort to match it.  He had the opportunity, but instead of getting the best out of himself creatively, he fought Paul over control of the band's business management.  From that point on, Paul was the creative center and it was only a matter of time before Lennon would flee.<br />The characterization of Lennon and Yoko as largely apolitical must anger a great many social revolutionaries, but it does seem to ring true.  Their bed-in peace faze was short-lived in the grand scheme of their lives.  The only real political battle Lennon had in the last 10 years of his life was trying to fight the Nixon Administration's attempts to deport him.  He also showed up for Carter's inaugural, shook hands, and promptly left.<br />Like I said, I don't know how true Goldman's account is.  It's probably best not to read this book as the sole authority on Lennon and the Beatles, but I certainly wouldn't skip it either.	2001-11-28

This book works as a sort of cliff notes duel biography up until the point they meet and work together.<br />Their first project was REAR WINDOW.  It was probably their best effort together.  DeRosa does a very thorough job explaining the contributions of each man on that film.  He offers interesting tidbits like how Grace Kelly's fashion model character closely resembled Hayes' own fashion model wife.  DeRosa also examines the Thelma Ritter humorous sage character and how that archetype turns up again and again in Hayes scripts.<br />The book then goes on to other Hitchcock/Hayes efforts like TO CATCH A THIEF, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and the TROUBLE WITH HARRY.  All of DeRosa's efforts here are worth your time.  If you're a scriptwriter you'll enjoy the evolution of these screenplays from ideas and general story ideas to finished scripts.<br />The book concludes with the Hitchcock/Hayes falling out.  DeRosa speculates that Hitchcock was never comfortable with a collaborator for long anyway, but that Hayes' notoriety in Hollywood hastened their breakup.  It can be argued that both men did their best work together and though they both found success apart, they didn't reach the same levels by themselves.  I liked this book a great deal and would recommend it to anyone who likes to study the process of film making.	2001-11-24

A 50+ year old book tackles themes still relevant today.<br />A  young French Algerian man, Meursault, kills an Arab for little reason and is tried for murder.  The book is an examination of a dispassionate killer that doesn't seem to care for anything, even whether he lives or dies.  Is Meursault is a typical sociopath or just an indifferent slob getting by?  I was taken by how his lack of passion was read by every character in the book differently.  He seems cold to the funeral director when his mother dies.  But his new girlfriend is attracted by the same lack of passion.  His boss sees him as a good employee though odd.  Ultimately the court sees him as a mad killer.  They all see what they want to see.<br />The lack of any human feeling was ultimately the demise of Meursault.  He could have done all of the same things, but if he had only shown some emotion, he would have survived.  I find this very true in life.  Our emotions are read for the good and bad.  We are expected to be dispassionate when we're professional and passionate when we're in love.  The deviation from those expectations many times leads us to trouble even when our actual actions are appropriate.  Meursault's actions are questionable, but it is easy to see that with a little charm and personality, he could have easily talked himself out of all of his troubles.<br />Of the 20th century classics, it is certainly one of the shortest, and it has plenty to say.  I liked it enough that I will attempt another Camus in the future.	2001-10-28

I first encountered Freberg on the radio talking about his United States of America album.  It was so clever that I subsequently got a hold of his Greatest Hits album and radio show album.  The book is just as entertaining as it reveals good stories on how he came to be an advertising man and revolutionize television commercials.<br />He spends a great deal of the book discussing his plans with David Merrick to put United States of America on Broadway.  The delay stopped what would have been a series of comedy history albums.  Unfortunately the book ends in the 1960s, before his biggest ad campaigns even started.  I bought this book in a bargain bin and I fear we may never see volume 2.<br />This was a well-written and fast paced book.  One of the better entertainment autobiographies I have ever read.	2001-07-30

Instead of discussing them one at a time, he examines their relationships with each other, and shows how those personal relationships effected pivotal situations in American History.<br />There's a long chapter on the complicated relationship between Jefferson and Adams through the years.  There is also a great chapter on the Hamilton/Burr Duel, the events leading up to it, and the best guess scenario of what really happened at the shooting.  But my favorite story is a dinner meeting at Thomas Jefferson's house in which Alexander Hamilton and James Madison come to a compromise that would eventually put the nation's capital on the Potomac River.<br />The book is full of short yet thorough tales.  The stories seem to leave out the unnecessary and highlight the consequential.  Ellis, gets a great deal of information into this short history book.	2001-07-17

Few people ever really knew Ronald Reagan.  He was a very private person.  This fact led to Edmund Morris writing a semi-fictional biography of Reagan, because he just couldn't understand his psychology.  Thankfully, longtime Reagan friend, Mike Deaver, decided to offer a personal memoir of his time with the ex-president.<br />Deaver goes way back.  Back to California when no one thought Reagan could be elected governor.  He spent a total of 20 years with Reagan the public figure.  In those 20 Years, he understood the private Reagan and his devoted marriage to Nancy.  Reagan didn't need anyone else but her.  He liked and even loved others, but if they drifted in and out of his life he didn't fret.  She filled his every void.<br />Deaver tells the story of a very involved president who read through stacks of position papers and briefings.  It was Reagan's mother who told him that if he learned to love reading, he would never feel alone.  The intellectuals have never understood Reagan.  They have always been willing to dismiss his substance as play acting for the camera.  But Reagan had the kind of vision that is rare for a leader.  He saw the shining city on a hill long before the rest of us.  He had the humility to think of himself as a regular guy.  He felt as comfortable with laborers as he did with Prime Ministers.  This was ultimately the reason he could connect with the American people.<br />After reading more than one account of the distant Ronald Reagan, I was very happy to read a telling that was reminiscent of the man I grew up with in my adolescent years.  When Reagan spoke, I heard the voice of a calm experienced captain that was taking the ship to port.  It was my misfortune, maybe, that I was too young to know how important he really was at the time.  I remember the last public speech he gave in 1993, where his ad-lib humor was a great reminder of what's been missing in politics ever since.  Michael Deaver helped me to remember the great man once more.re.	2001-05-29

When America rebelled against Hillary Clinton's health care initiative, I slowly realized that other government services that I took for granted also began as a political proposal.  I asked myself why it may be good for government to control education, but not health care.  It was that kind of question that led me to read a whole host of books that ask the same question.  The latest being, Libertarianism: A Primer.<br />In this book, author David Boaz tackles many modern day issues from a Libertarian viewpoint.  The main theme of the book is the importance of property rights.  Boaz explains that the first property right is the ownership of self.  Without ownership of self, the ownership of anything else is meaningless.  If you are willing to accept his thesis and read further, you will find that private property is the basis of the free market, and the free market is what makes human freedom possible.<br />Markets just naturally churn out what we want, because they are rewarded for doing so.  An entrepreneur that provides a needed good or service can then provide his family a better life.  Whereas the bureaucrat's motivation is to make his position and staff more powerful.  His salary won't be tied into the success or failure of any given project.  But the entrepreneur must live and die according to our fancy.  The entrepreneur may be inept and fail to achieve what we want, but other venture capitalists will take his place until the thing is done right.  When the government fouls up some needed service or good, they scream for a budget increase, as if our stinginess is the real culprit for their ineptitude.<br />Some have argued that Libertarianism is inevitable, because the Internet and technology will render government powerless to control the mechanizations of society.  I am not so optimistic.  Most people think that the money coming from government is free.  They tell me that they couldn't afford education if the government didn't step in and provide it.  These are people who live in $100,000 houses, drive $20,000 cars and pay a mountain of taxes.  Someday, maybe people will realize that they are paying for these things anyway, until then, the rest of us can enjoy reading books like Libertarianism: A Primer, by David Boaz.They tell me that they couldn't afford education if the government didn't step in and provide it.

Born in 1903, Adler worked his way from humble origins to academic achievements reached by few.  He quit school in his teens and became a copy boy on a New York newspaper.  He would later find his way into the Ivy League, attending Columbia University where we studied and later taught.  He quickly championed the liberal arts education.  He believes that students who have a well-balanced education become more productive private citizens.<br />His endorsement of the classical studies led to his teaching the of Great Books of the Western World, which he thought was the best avenue to a well-rounded education.  If you own a set of Encyclopedia Britannica's Great Books of the Western World, you'll see Adler's name as associate editor.  He wrote both volumes of the Great Ideas syntopicon that begin the series.<br />This book centers on the professional, rather than the personal, more so than the average autobiography.  It's quite philosophical.  Adler makes you think about different propositions as he reveals his discovery of certain knowledge.  He's quick to point out his mistakes of youth, and he shares many stories of how his own lack of tact alienated him from his colleagues and other important people.  He's mellowed much with age and has become more and more respected within his field.  It's a very honest recap of a long and productive life.  I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in philosophy, the great books, or liberal arts education.	2001-05-14

Travis McGee is one of all-time great fictional wise guys.  He's witty, and pretty resourceful.  The Florida setting makes a great backdrop and the books are full of action.  The McGee brand of private eye was a masterstroke on the part of MacDonald.  McGee is just a seemingly innocent beach bum that makes his money stealing money from those who have previously stolen it from someone else.<br />In this opening book of the series, McGee takes on an ex-con that stole some goods belonging to a friend of a friend of McGee's.  That's all you need to know of the plot.  The real enjoyment of these books are the journeys McGee travels.<br />There's a funny stream of misogyny that runs through this series that I have to comment on.  McGee's exploits with women are much in the vein of James Bond, but MacDonald, I think, seems uncomfortable with the fact, because McGee is always rationalizing his behavior and the author's sympathies seem to be with him.  One way or another, McGee always has some deeper reason as to why his constant use of various women is actually doing them a whole lot of good.  Travis McGee is the sensitive womanizer.  Now, I've never met such a person, but if one existed, I think that he'd spend the majority of his time on the analysts couch.  This is just the first book, but when you're ten or twelve deep into the series, you'll no doubt laugh as McGee says something like, &quot;All the women mean something&quot; after one dies the sudden, yet requisite, death.<br />Anyway, these books are fun and their goal is to entertain, and they do just that.  If you read one or two, there is a good chance you'll read all of them sooner or later.  I usually take one on vacation.	2001-05-04

Henry Hazzlit's main thesis is that when we focus our economic policy on a particular group, we somehow ignore other groups that are adversely effected.  A high tariff on cars may help manufacturers of cars, but it hurts those who buy cars.  Artificially boosting milk prices may make the farmer feel rich, but it's out of the pockets of the milk buyer.  Since there are far more consumers than producers, the special attention harms more people than it helps.<br />In essence, every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  The government focuses on paying Paul, but not stealing from Peter. Hazzlit argues that both deserve their due.  Usually Paul is big and easy to see, but even if Peter is a conglomeration of people and hard to find, he still exists and he is still being hurt.  He also argues that Job Works programs like the New Deal are more harmful than helpful, because they absorb resources that could be more productively used in the free market.  People are a component of productivity, argues Hazzlit, and when their use is diverted to inefficient means, the loss of productivity costs every taxpayer and citizen a better life.<br />Hazzlit gets a lot done in this short volume.  He uses the kind of common sense that seems to be absent from most economic theories and his writing style is very easy to follow.	2001-05-02

He goes into detail about Churchill's home Chartwell and the expenses Winston had to meet to live his lifestyle.  Winston earned the necessary money writing histories and newspaper columns.  His writing gave him not only an income, but a voice about the coming Nazi aggression that most of England was blind to.<br />We've seen promising political careers derailed due to self-indulgence and Churchill's career seemed just that in the 1930s.  He was a young member of the cabinet in World War I, but after a principled cabinet resignation in the early 30s, he became an outsider in his own party.  This didn't stop Churchill from antagonizing everyone who wouldn't listen to him.  Eventually, his rise to Prime Minister in 1940 was one of history's biggest I told you sos.  But it wasn't his ability as War Prime Minister that made Churchill great, according to Manchester, but his ability to see early Nazi aggression and danger when the whole world slept.  Whether you agree or disagree, Manchester has created a wonderful detailed comprehensive biography of the time period.<br />Manchester's easy way with words, apt scholarship and detailed descriptions really bring the time period to life...	2001-04-11

Cialdini is mostly interested in the way marketers use psychological persuasion to sell products.  He writes of 6 definite techniques in which sellers can make buyers comply.  In each technique he explains a classic example of how that technique is used.  He demonstrates how the Chinese Prison Camp officials were able to coax anti-American statements from American POW's during the Korean War, why 30 eye witnesses did nothing to stop the beating and murder of a woman in New York City, and how Jim Jones was able to persuade his followers to mass suicide.  Scary, but they are the same phenomenon that helps Bubba sell you a car.<br />The book works on both edges of the sword.  While Cialdini's focus is to make consumers better informed about the way they are sold products, the quote on the front suggests that its the most important book for marketers in 10 years.  Meaning that the information will not only help consumers steer clear from phony salesmen, but that phony salesmen will be even better prepared to be phony if they read the book before you.  If you're Machiavellian, you'll enjoy your new powers of persuasion.  If you're more virtuous, you enjoy the ability to thwart the powers of these characters.  Either way, I suggest you be the first one on your block to read it.	2001-03-01

His thesis is a CONFLICT OF VISIONS.  He believes that political thought can be broken into two different camps.  With some crossover and a few exceptions, people either subscribe to the constrained vision or the unconstrained vision.  <br />The constrained vision believes that people have natural flaws and our resources are better spent designing society with those flaws in mind.  The unconstrained vision believes that man can be molded and perfected with the right instruction and society should spend their resources to reach that end.  <br />Sowell does an excellent job in explaining that most current ideas have their origins, at least somewhat, in philosophies that are over 100 years old.  My favorite bit is Adam Smith's idea that supposes you were told every person in China was killed.  Smith argues that you might feel immediate surprise and maybe even some faint remorse, but it would be nothing compared to the worry you'd feel if you'd lost end of your little finger.  Smith's idea is that it's neither good nor bad that man is self-interested, but that societies would be much more productive if they recognized that truth, and worked with it, instead of spending their resources trying to change man's nature, which Smith believed was impossible. <br />You won't soon forget this work.	2001-02-18

In that span of time he wrote a famous book, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, and a couple of classic screenplays, AFRICAN QUEEN and NIGHT OF THE HUNTER.  This collection of magazine film reviews and essays is in many ways the leftover part of his work, and yet it feels like enough to make a reputation on.  His reviews span just one decade, the 1940s.  Many of them tackle foreign films that may be unavailable for all I know.<br />Interesting to me is that he spends three weeks discussing Chaplin's MONSIEUR VERDOUX, which is a most unusual movie and mostly forgotten today.  This might be because he saw it as his only chance to write a poignant piece on the greatest living film artist, or it may be because he identified with the plight of mankind theme that Chaplin was reaching for.  You can pick another reason, yourself, but it was a bold decision, because most critics panned the film (according to him) and most readers probably couldn't even see the movie in their small towns.  It was as if he knew he would be writing for posterity.  Like all critics, he cultivated his darlings.  He saw much in the work of John Huston and was very skillful in his sizing up of TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE.  I was impressed that he predicted the all-time classic nature of the film, but also understood the studio system gimmicks that took away from the genius.<br />You don't have to be literary minded like W. H. Auden to enjoy this book.  You'll like it, if you like movies.	2001-02-17

There has become a great tradition of directors interviewing directors for all of posterity.  Bogdanovich was successful at getting a great number of the leading directors on the record.  This was his attempt at debriefing John Ford.<br />John Ford was quite an elusive character.  He was considered a great artist inside and outside of Hollywood during his life.  This short book isn't a bad attempt to have him comment on those films most precious to him and to us.  Unlike Orson Welles, who made only a few films over 40 years, and spoke on them extensively with Bogdanovich, Ford speaks just a sentence or two or maybe a paragraph on some of the greatest films of all time.  Grapes of Wrath?  &quot;I liked the idea of a family going out and trying to find their way in the world.&quot;  She Wore a Yellow Ribbon?  &quot;I tried to copy the Remington style there.&quot;  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance?  &quot;I think they were both good characters and I rather liked the story.&quot;<br />I hope I haven't made it sound too simplistic, because Ford actually reveals the most important parts of his films with very few words.  Just reading a sentence or two and watching the film gives you the idea of what Ford was trying to convey.  It may even give these films new meaning.	2001-02-07

John Lucaks, teacher and historian, tells us early on of how he escaped from Hungary shortly after World War II.  He lived under the Nazi's and then the Communists, despised both, and then made a life for himself in America.<br />Good writing is about good writing.  Any subject is interesting when presented the right way and Lucaks goes a long way in presenting his story in a way that is fresh and full of life.  He reveals many personal observations and details that leave him bare.  He laments the loss of his first mistress (a married Hungarian lady with two children) and keeps her picture still.  He describes, in detail, the harrowing illness and death of his first wife and the sadly sweet feelings that her memory still conjure up.  He goes a long way in describing why Philadelphia is superior to New York City and why the Pennsylvania countryside is superior to both.<br />But mostly, Lucaks explains why he is a political reactionary, why that distinction is a noble one, and why it suits him so well.  Don't construe this to mean that he is a member of the John Birch society or something, his political opinions are really hard to pigeonhole.  He is a man of unique perspective, who had a front row seat to the happenings in the Second World War.  He saw his people at their best and at their worst.  He witnessed people who blew with the wind, and others that stood on conviction.  He got a glimpse of what Eastern Europe could have been like if the Americans hadn't left it in the hands of the Russians.<br />The one caveat I have to offer is that this book is not breeze to read.  The language is easy enough, but Lucaks insists that you think about his writing, and that takes a little more time than reading the latest popular novel.	2001-01-20

I wouldn't have read this book had I not seen the articulate David Schippers on television.  He's a straight shooter there and in this book.  It doesn't matter what party you belong to, you can find someone to hate in the impeachment mess.  Starting at the top, there is much to despise about the Clinton administration, obviously.  You could also take aims at the Democrats in Congress who didn't even want to see the evidence, for fear that their conscience's would demand a '&quot;yeah&quot; vote.  If you loathe Republicans, you'll love the 55 Republican senators that tried to derail the entire case, because they were afraid of voter reprisals.<br />The only people who come off well in the book are those that were the object of scorn in much of the media, the 15 House managers, led by Henry Hyde.  Some of them were elected by razor thin margins in tough districts, but they decided to do their constitutional duty and move forward with impeachment, even if it meant their political careers.<br />With enough time and support, the House team could have built a case around Filegate, Travelgate, Chinagate as well as Bootygate.  Of course the media and the President kept telling us that it was just about the booty, but the real meat was never explored during the Senate trial.  Much of the evidence is under lock and key for the next 50 years.  Suffice it to say that Clinton has no bones about lying to anybody, at anytime, about anything, if it will suit his own personal skin.  Schippers failed in skinning the President, but his book will last as a seminal history of what should have happened.	2000-12-18

Dallek makes a good point that the impact of Reagan's 1966 win of the California governorship has been ignored by current journalists and historians.  Today, the 60s counterculture is romanticized by the baby-boomer media, like Stonewall Jackson is lionized by the Daughters of the Confederacy.  But in the 1960s, civil unrest wasn't too fashionable.  People were frightened.  Enter Ronald Reagan.<br />Reagan was considered a lightweight by Democrats and liberal Republicans, and on top of that, he spoke in the same right-wing tone that supposedly cost Barry Goldwater the 1964 Presidential Election.  A few conservative businessmen thought differently.  They liked the speech Reagan gave in the last days of the Goldwater campaign. They thought that Reagan was the right mix of personality, intelligence and political persuasion, and could pull a big upset in the 1966 election versus the 2-term Governor Edmund &quot;Pat&quot; Brown.<br />We all know that Reagan pulled that upset, but unlike the other histories, Mr. Dallek shows us how he pulled it off.  He also provides a look into the Brown campaign, and the many misfortunes Brown suffered in the two years prior to his defeat.  Nothing could go right for the seasoned Brown, while nothing went wrong for the neophyte Reagan.  It would seem that destiny produced Ronald Reagan.  In this book, you'll see how Reagan and destiny took care of Edmund &quot;Pat&quot; Brown.	2000-12-11

I caught a glimpse of the great DiMaggio at a charity golf tournament in February of 1998.  He was chipping his ball out of the sand onto the 18th green.  The tournament was full of celebrities.  No one batted an eye when Joe Namath or Bill Russell sauntered by, but the aged DiMaggio swinging a golf club drew everyone's attention.  &quot;Hey DiMaggio is playing 18!&quot;  His swing was weak, he had barely a year to live, but I was taken by the man, who with great effort, raked his own divot, despite the fact that anyone would have jumped at the duty.  That was class.  He still had it.<br />This book is a long history of why he still had it.  It's also a history that makes DiMaggio more human.  Like all histories, great men have shadow sides that the public learns about after their deaths.  DiMaggio is no different.<br />Many reviewers have opined that Mr. Cramer has tarnished DiMaggio's image, but I think the opposite is true.  Cramer has written of a private introverted man who was heartbroken by Marilyn Monroe and never recovered.  DiMaggio wanted the security to remain a private man and for that he relied on making money.  No shame to make money from one's own name, when one's life achievements make that name so valuable.  It's also true that DiMaggio would be fickle with friends.  His need for privacy sometimes drove friends away, but that was his right.  He might not have been an easy person to know, but that makes him no less heroic to the public at large.  He was a model citizen that went to war when his country called.

What happens when a best-selling novelist-philosopher splits with her self-anointed intellectual heir?  Answer: My Life with Ayn Rand by Nathaniel Branden.  For those of us who find inspiration in Rand's tales of rugged individualism, Branden offers a personal memoir that humanizes the author of those tales.<br />Branden begins the story as a 14 year-old boy whose life is changed by reading the FOUNTAINHEAD.  Six Years later Branden would meet the author and their meeting would began a friendship-affair that would last 17 years.  In Branden, Rand found a person who truly understood and could champion her unique views.  Their philosophical chats evolved into Branden spearheading a series of New York City lectures.  The lectures would become such that their influence spread across the country.  During this time, Rand published her masterpiece ATLAS SHRUGGED.  She also dubbed Branden her intellectual heir and began a love affair that would eventually ruin everything.<br />But Ayn was 25 years older than the randy Nathan Branden.  Nathan's eyes wandered to a veritable knockout of a student (Patrecia) and they began having a thing.  Even the most devoted followers of Rand will understand Branden's dilemma when they see the young girl's modelesque photo.<br />As you can guess, Rand wasn't too happy with Branden's scorn.  The irony is that her philosophy doesn't allow a person to rationally protest a dissolution.  According to objectivism, Branden shouldn't be made to live his life for another person, even if that person is the godmother of objectivism.  It's nothing new for a philosopher to live less than the ideals of his/her belief, but somewhat disappointing that the idealistic Rand would fall short.<br />You may want to read the book because you love Rand or hate her, but you'll enjoy Branden's frank and well-written account of their relationship regardless of your preconceived notions.  I also liked that the memoir offers a history of the molding of objectivism.  These were the days that Rand was expanding on her views and putting them in nonfiction written form.  A lot of to like in this short history.These were the days that Rand was expanding on her views and putting them in nonfiction written form.  A lot of to like in this short history.	2000-11-26

Not because I always agree with Bill, but because he asks the toughest questions on television.  After seeing Jesse Ventura joke his way around the American airwaves I was surprised at how sober he was on the Factor.<br />The book is set up much like the show, in that it is mostly a social critique with built-in footnotes and opinions.  O'Reilly backs up much of the material with evidence to support his opinions.  You couldn't call anyone with such outspoken opinions a moderate, but his opinions are all over the spectrum.  He's anti-death penalty and anti-abortion.  He supports a tax-cut and more government regulations for the airlines.    <br />If you can't get the show, you'll find yourself calling your local cable company after reading this book.  If you watch the show, this book will answer many questions not covered on the air.  This is a good choice for anyone who enjoys current issues and politics with a fresh perspective.	2000-11-19
US	52888137	RZ0UC60XXOVU5	0451191153	594264062	The Fountainhead	Books	5	3	9	N	N	A classic ignored by mainstream intellectuals	Like Atlas Shrugged, this tale is an extraordinary one.  Ayn Rand worked within the realm of ideas and their consequences.  The characters here are both the usual and the heroic.  Howard Roark, our hero, stands firm for individual integrity, against the critics and the masses until his point-of-view wins out.  The greatness of Rand's work is that she sets a path in which mediocrity loses.  Like any philosophy, her work didn't change the world, but had a deep impact on individuals that changed themselves and helped to make the world that much better.<br />The villain Ellsworth Toohey is one of the great nemesis' in American literature.  He is plainly passive-aggressive.  He uses people's insecurities for his own power.  Much like many villains in real life, Toohey defeats his foes through subtleties and pawns.  He spends a lifetime propping up disciples around him for insulation.  The bandwagon mentaility means that none of his ideas need ever come under logical scrutiny.  When his game is discovered, his power is such, that he is not easily defeated.  Roark's use of logical rhetoric at the conclusion of the novel is such that Toohey's nefarious work is rendered meaningless.<br />For as good as the work is, I am opposed to Rand's atheism.  She would replace God with the worship of man.  Her heroic characters certainly make a case for such, but in real life even our most brilliant men are not without flaws and contradictions.  I believe that God would want man to as heroic as Rand sees him.  Rand would feel any recognition of a superior being would cast man back into the pool of the collective.  This disagreement would put me outside the realm of Rand followers, but I love the book anyway and feel that it has a great deal to offer anyone who believes in individual liberty or is open to hear a case for it.	2000-11-18

The just of the title refers to Murch's theory that an eye blink is the equivalent of an edit.  He found that when an audience is riveted they will seldom blink.  His further studies led him to believe that an audience will generally blink when a film cut should be made.  Whether true or not, it was truly thought provoking.<br />I also found his analysis of non-linear editing quite insightful.  He goes a good way to explain the positive and the negative of editing on a computer versus the old cut and paste method.  The computer oriented method offers quicker editing and fixing.  When you physically cut film it cannot be undone without a lengthy ordeal.  On a computer, you can quickly restore any changes.<br />Murch, though, feels that the necessity of rolling through raw footage on a movieola sometimes led to better shot selection during his re-edits.  When editors digitize what they initially like, they limit themselves to the other takes that might make more sense after a rough cut is made.  Interesting.<br />These are just some of the many jewels offered in this short work.	2000-10-30

It's also a nice linear history of the many, now famous, Jay Ward creations and their aftermath's.<br />The short biographies on the many voice talents used by Ward were welcome.  Ward's voice talent stable may have been the best in the history of animation.  Hans Conreid, Paul Frees, William Conrad, Bill Scott, June Foray, Daws Butler brought the now famous Ward creations to life with voice, but they were also well known for other characters and voice work outside the Ward influence.<br />The book ends with a well-written appendix of the Ward cartoons, their production dates, and other significant information.  If you're a big fan of Ward's work, you'll get a lot out of the book.  If you have a more casual interest, you may not like it.	2000-10-15

But he is probably best known for his actions before the House Un-American Activities committee in the 1950s.  Kazan named names.  This had made him an enigma to the dominant Hollywood culture.  Today, he is recognized as an important filmmaker in the history of movies, but his political views have made his life somewhat bumpy in his chosen profession.<br />Kazan proves to be erudite and witty and humorous and surprising.  He openly hates some of his own movies, though reviewers consider them classics.  He does love his version of a STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, which he also directed on Broadway.  He speaks with some regret that he didn't also direct the movie version of DEATH OF A SALESMAN (another Broadway play he debuted).<br />That is just a small bit, but I would recommend the book to anyone interested in the politics of communism in the 1950s and its aftermath, or any film fan that likes to dissect film directors and their work.  I am interested in both subjects and found Kazan illuminating on both.	2000-10-06

Pressfield does wonders to set up the town and it many  machinations.  He creates a wonderful fictitious golf course and gives it a  great deal of personality.  You're just dying to play there.<br />The old  narrator was then a 10-year-old caddy assistant in that game for Rannulph  Junah, the lesser known of three competitors.  The other two were the golf  legends Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen.  The tournament itself would be worth  reading 500 pages for, but the real story is that of Junah's caddy Bagger  Vance.<br />Bagger Vance teaches Junah and us about life as it relates to  golf.  He explains the beauty of the golf swing and why it mirrors the  beauty of life.  As the novel unfolds we learn more about Vance than Junah,  but you'll have to see that part for yourself.<br />The nuances of golf are  well-told.  It obvious the author is an avid golfer himself.  The  conclusion of the golf tournament is also noteworthy in that it's  surprising and yet reflects the inner meaning of the story as a whole.<br />I  think avid golfers will love the book.  Others will enjoy it, but maybe not  with the same passion.	2000-09-03

Goldman has an easy style  that a reader can just breeze through, but his strong opinion may be a  turnoff to some.  The writer of ABSOLUTE POWER, a mildly entertaining  Eastwood vehicle, has the chutzpah to harshly criticize SAVING PRIVATE  RYAN.  His observations are interesting and I am still trying to decide if  they are valid.  Either way, he takes a stand and that makes the book more  daring.<br />I enjoyed the anecdotes quite a bit.  It was funny to hear  Goldman quote Michael Douglas asking Val Kilmer if he wanted a career like  Mickey Rourke or Eric Roberts when Kilmer was being difficult on the set of  GHOST AND THE DARKNESS.<br />What I liked best was Goldman's breakdown of  stories into screenplays.  He goes a good way to explaining why some  stories are great, but won't film well.  He explains the difference between  a screenplay you give to the studio head and the screenplay the director  uses to shoot from.<br />Finally, he writes the first hour of a screenplay.  He asks us to evaluate it.  He then consults several Hollywood  screenwriters to evaluate it.  It's interesting how much insight a  particular person will have on a certain element of the work, while  ignoring something others are bothered by.  This goes a good way to  explaining why a script doctor can be good or bad for a film.<br />I was  expecting to read a straight forward memoir of Hollywood, but what I got  was a how-to class on screenwriting as well, and it was a pleasant  surprise.	2000-08-30

This feature on Hemingway, originally a NEW  YORKER piece, is a delight for fans of Ross and fans of Hemingway of which  I can be counted as both.<br />The story begins as Miss Ross meets Hemingway  at Idlewood Airport (now JFK) in New York City in 1950.  Ross spends the  next two days going to museums, shopping, and meeting Hemingway's friend  Marlene Dietrich and Editor Charles Scribner.<br />She's so unobtrusive in  the story, you forget that she was actually in the room.  When Hemingway  talks to her, it's like a character has stepped out of a novel to speak  with the author.  You get this feeling because &quot;Papa&quot; is so much  himself that he doesn't seem to be hiding his true personality from a  member of the press corps.<br />I learned a good deal about Papa in this short  book.  You will too.	2000-08-13

The Cutting Begins: A Film Editor's Story (Da Capo Paperback)	Books	4	29	30	N	N	A veteren film editor shares his life	Rosenblum edited feature films from the late 50s until early 80s, and is  most noted for his collaborative efforts with Woody Allen in the 1970s.  But his most interesting stories in the book are from a decade earlier when  he was still experimenting.  Though, I have only seen about half of the  movies Rosenblum writes of, it makes the stories no less  fascinating.<br />Rosenblum's major accomplishment in the book is to shed  light on the importance of the film editor in motion pictures.  He's not  wrong in stating that their efforts have been largely ignored by critics  and the public at large.  What's interesting is that the editor as an  influence in film is rarely even discussed by film critics and historians.  It's probably because people are largely unsure of what an editor's true  contributions are to any one motion picture.<br />Through the course of the  book, Rosenblum takes apart THE RAID ON MINSKY'S, THE PAWNBROKER, and ANNIE  HALL in depth.  He also gives examples of how much an initial cut of a film  can differ from the final cut.<br />I found the book quite informative, and  learned more about film editing than I had expected.	2000-08-07

His stories of feminist extremism and other conservative Points of view are similar to Rush Limbaugh's books of the  early 90s.<br />What's different is his political upbringing and conversion  to right-of-center politics.  As an ex-hippie and ex-member of the vast  left-wing media, Mr. Stein shares telling examples of how journalism works.  He describes the assumptions that liberal media types make when reporting  a certain kind of story.  These are the tales that he tells best, and why  the book is worth the time.<br />Stein's conversion may still in progress it  would seem.  He has harsh words for conservative stalwarts Trent Lott and  Tom Delay,  he is pro-choice with some reservations and he's more accepting  of marginal behaviors than mid-American Republicans. I guess you would best  describe him as a Compassionate Conservative that Found Inner Peace.	2000-08-02

Also  interesting is the fact that Podhoretz had his falling out with people  sometimes for reasons other than his right-wing conversion in the 1970s and  1980s.<br />The book is quite good at explaining the subtle differences in  opinion among left-wing American intellectuals of the time.  Almost  everyone had trifled with Communism or fellow travelerism, but out of that  start grew many different points of view that Norman and his Ex-Friends  would argue about again and again.  Being philosophical writers, they would  tend to explore many different avenues from one another.  It's a wonder  that any two writers remain life-long friends.<br />I grew less interested in  these characters as the book progressed though.  The pattern gave me the  &quot;heard it once, heard it a thousand times&quot; feeling.  By Hannah  Arendt, I was tired from a long journey.  But not because Mr. Podhoretz  isn't a fine writer, he most certainly is.  Only, I'll be ready for another  subject matter from him next time around.	2000-07-23

Even among my history-buff friends, very little is known of the Mexican war, and little still of the future  Civil War heroes that fought there.  This book offers an excellent  introduction to that conflict and those heroes.<br />The story focuses mostly  on General Winfield Scott, the Mexican War commander and Captain Robert E.  Lee, who would find distinction here and elsewhere.  Scott has been a  veteran since the War of 1812 and has great disdain for the many  politicians that he sees getting in the way of war fighting.  Lee is a 40  year-old Army Engineer who has never seen combat.  Lee's bravery and honor  shine through and the story gives him much credit for the eventual victory.<br />I wasn't a partisan of Shaara's first work GODS AND GENERALS.  I  think I was expecting it to be as good as his father's classic, THE KILLER  ANGELS.  It wasn't a fair comparison for me to make. Now that I have read  and enjoyed GONE FOR SOLDIERS, I have re-thought my earlier opinion and  hope that Shaara continues to write such gems.	2000-07-21

He never directly stated the magazines leanings,  but promised that they were decidedly different and quite possibly much  like my own.  He was right on both counts.  I've spent the subsequent years  reading about every splinter brand of American Conservatism, but Mr.  Buckley's views are still most like my own.  For this, I can highly  recommend this collection.<br />For those of you whose views may substantially  differ with Mr. Buckley, I can name a couple of reasons why this book might  be of interest.  1) You'll learn the components of a wonderfully given  speech.  Buckley is able to tie in the locale and group he's speaking to in  such a way that it seems that he has been waiting his whole life to give  this particular speech at this particular location.  2) He blends humor  into the most serious of speeches in such a way that it never seems forced.  He's good at relating a particularly good barb leveled at him (laughter)  to be followed by an even sharper retort (more laughter).  3) He has a  gentle nature that comes through again and again.  His overachieving hasn't  seemed to get in the way of his many friendships or in the love of his  family.<br />I don't know if history will speak of William F. Buckley Jr., 200  years, but any evidence that need be shown to his importance could be  summed up in this volume.  If you have never read Mr. Buckley this would be  a great way to start.	2000-07-10

Steve Stone is one of the most underrated broadcasters on television and  the anecdotes he provides for the book are truly gems.<br />Steve loved  Harry quite a bit, and blasts former Cub play by play man Milo Hamilton who  was particularly ugly to Harry before and after his death.  But the subtext  of the early chapters is that Harry had some flaws, and Harry and Steve had  their ups and downs during their career together.  It would have been easy  to gloss over that reality, but it's a credit to Stone that he paints a  very human picture of a baseball legend.	2000-06-14

The first as a great description of Nixon's 10 commandments and why they work.  The second is the application or misapplication of these principles by world leaders throughout history  and the consequences.<br />All ten offer much wisdom, but my favorite is:  NEVER GIVE UP UNILATERALLY WHAT COULD BE USED AS A BARGAINING CHIP.  MAKE  YOUR ADVERSARIES GIVE UP SOMETHING FOR EVERYTHING THEY GET.  Here Humes  explains that giving up something that is meaningless to you, as a token of  good will, may come back to weaken your overall bargaining position.  He  explains how LBJ conceded so many small points to Brezhnev early on, that  when the bargaining began, LBJ could only offer up those things that he  held dear in order to gain those things that Breznev would have given away  cheaply.<br />Bargaining from a position of strength seems to run through all  10 commandments and no doubt some people will find these tactics  heavy-handed, but Humes describes examples such as Jimmy Carter and Neville  Chamberlain, who discounted strength in the name of idealism, and  ultimately became case-studies in the failure of leadership.<br />I found  the book fascinating on a political scale, but the principles certainly  apply to the workplace.  Knowing what you have and what they want will  better help you get what you want.	2000-06-11

You could argue that Hemingway the man was more interesting than his fiction and Reynolds goes a pretty good  distance to show why.  Hemingway takes his first safari, catches Marlin in  Key West and fights in the Spanish Civil War, and switches women before the  end of the decade.<br />Reynolds paints a fairly descriptive portrait of  Hemingway, but also reminds us of other current events as the decade  unfolds.  Hemingway begins the decade mostly apolitical, but he is very  critical of the New Deal Programs he sees running in his hometown of Key  West Florida.  In 1936 he likens President Roosevelt's plan to socialism,  but his support two years later of antifascist guerrillas in the Spanish  Civil War allies him with downright communists.<br />It was also interesting  to watch Hemingway's friendships crumble.  Reynolds describes how Gertrude  Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Sherwood Anderson went their separate ways  from Papa for various reasons, but mostly because Hemingway was an  explosive character.  His larger than life dominating personality coupled  with his fatigue for certain personality types doomed a great deal of  one-time friendships.<br />What I like mostly of Reynolds work is that he  likes Hemingway a great deal, and this comes through, despite Papa's many  flaws.	2000-06-08

Afterall, there just isn't much documented evidence for the traditional view.  Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford is easier to support  analytically, because much more is known about him.  If you were presented  with two cases of evidence for authorship, and knew nothing about the  controversy, you would be hard pressed to favor the Stratford on Avon  gentleman who bears the same name as the immortal bard.  This is the way  that Whalen presents the arguments.  He tries to let the traditionalists  refute the Oxfordians claims, but they don't fare so well.  Oxford's life  parallel's HAMLET'S in so many ways as to make one believe that Oxford  either wrote the plays or was the Stratford man's inspiration.<br />But the  defense of Oxford against Stratfordians isn't without critics.  Oxford died  in 1604 and that seems too early for some of the authorship, but the  records of when these works were written is scant at best.<br />In the end you  have two mounds of evidence and Whalen shows that Oxford's pile outweighs  the mainstream pile.  I'm not a Shakespearean scholar like those in the  fray, but I'd lay 13-5 odds that Oxford wrote these plays based on the  research in this book.	2000-06-05

No doubt some will criticize it because Davis doesn't spend his time eschewing Wayne's politically incorrect opinions, but neither does the author lionize  Wayne the man.  What you have left is a concise and readable 400 page  biography that covers all the movies and all the wives.  Davis gives his  opinions as to why the Wayne legend still survives, and what his fellow  actors thought of him way back when.<br />Interesting is the story behind the  making of the ALAMO, a film he produced, directed and starred in, the  subsequent Oscar campaign, and the aftermath.  Also interesting is Wayne's  relationship with director John Ford, whom he loved, and their  disagreements.	2000-05-30

Noonan is a gifted writer and uniquely qualified to judge Hillary as a lifetime New Yorker.  Noonan's analysis was top notch.  Why  does Hillary get away with blanket statements like &quot;vast right wing  conspiracy&quot; to explain the presidents lies?  How could Mrs. Clinton  have believed Bill's public lie about Monica Lewinksy after Gennifer  Flowers, Paula Jones, Juanita Broderick and a hosts of others?<br />Much of  the book is a psychoanalysis of the Clintons and their need to be loved and  hold power.  It was very much like her analysis of Reagan, in a previous  book, in which she analyzed him as an adult child of an alcoholic.  I agree  with the pscho-analysis of Hillary, but Noonan many times relies on unnamed  friends of the Clinton's as source material.  While I have no reason to  disbelieve these quotes, I kept wondering who these friends were that would  talk to Peggy, but remain friends of the Clintons.<br />The speech written  (dreamt) by Noonan in which Hillary talks tough to Hollywood moguls was  brilliant in pointing out the first lady's lack of concern over real issues  and their solutions, but the book may have been stronger without the  distraction of such a device on the heals of Edmund Morris' semi-fictional  biography of Reagan.

Written during the 1920s these tales are every bit as gritty as the  Raymond Chandler short stories that would come a decade or two later.  The  Op is a fat unromantic type that knows how to solve crime with his head and  his hands.  He encounters people that we would best avoid and puts them  away or does them in.  Some of the stories are superior to the others, but  every tale is worth the telling.	2000-05-21

He isn't asking that the federal government privatize roads, or eliminate the EPA, but he would like to see them do their constitutional duties first and leave other tasks for the market place.  His premise is  that we should judge government actions not by intentions, but by outcome.<br />He makes a good case that New Deal and Great Society programs have been  around long enough to quantify the benefits, but the numbers indicate no  improvement.  Also, Murray contends the government has been neglecting  their real duties such as national defense and foreign policy to look after  the welfare state.<br />Murray discusses education, the environment, drug  policy, discrimination, economics, and  responsibility from a fresh point  of view.  If you are tired of the same old ideas on the evening news, read  this book.	2000-04-28

I was dead wrong proving once again that a great  writer makes anything interesting.  <br />The guys are back from Gradualcanal  and suffering both physical and psychological effects.  They are happy to  be alive and ashamed they didn't die along side their buddies.  It's hard  to believe that so many people they meet know nothing about the war being  fought out there.  They believe in the other men from their old company,  but little else.  <br />It could be argued that it is the weakest of the  trilogy.  Jones hurried to write the book before his early death at age 55.   It was published more than 20 years after the war's end and suffers  somewhat from the knowledge of those 20 years. The references to the songs  seem more nostalgic than informative.  His analysis of the sexes would have  been brilliant in 1946, but easily made in the 1970s.  But those are minor  points, because the book is every bit as honest as gritty as anything that  he ever wrote.  Good enough that you don't want it to end, but harsh enough  that you're afraid to read it a second time.	2000-04-03

If you want to know about Andy Kaufman, this is the book to read.  Kaufman's good friend, Bob Zmuda was there and saw everything first hand.  The book is plenty funny and goes a long way to showing how eccentric Kaufman was.  It's definitely from the perspective of a good friend who wishes to lionize the comedian.  Maybe more interesting than the Kaufman story is Zmuda's description of the insane screenwriter he worked for.  The guy and Zmuda would travel around the city with a wad of bills looking for dialogue.  The story is just as preposterous as any act that Kaufman ever pulled off, but it is so fun to read.  Whether Kaufman will be considered a comedic genius in 50 years is anyone's guess, but this book is a good witness for his cause.	2000-03-14

I likend the authorship question to fantasies like 'Where is Elvis' and 'Roswell, New Mexico.'  Sobran presents a good deal of circumstantial  evidence for Oxford.  History records little circumstantial evidence for  Shakspere, other than he shares the same name with the bard and he was an  actor in some of these plays.  Ghost writers are common.  As a nobleman,  Oxford had two reasons to stay quiet.  1) It was beneath his dignity to  write plays  2) He could more easily satire his court friends (and enemies)  with anonymity.<br />Oxford's experiences seem to reflect the experiences of  the playwright in many cases.  Numerous phrases from Oxford's private  letters, appear again in Shakespeare's plays.  Sobran offers better and  more specific arguments than these.  If I were a Shakespeare scholar, I  would no doubt be angry at any probing book debunking the accepted theory,  but this study is a well-made case for the Duke of Oxford.	2000-03-14

The men have returned to Tennessee from guadalcanal as casualties.  These  are basically the same characters from the earlier books, carried forward  with different names.  As their physical ailments heal, we begin to realize  that their psychological ailments are worsening.  Their wives are distant  and their girlfriends are shallow, but there is plenty of whiskey.<br />An  army hospital may not seem the setting for an exciting story, but this book  is every bit as compelling as Jones' prior installments. It's difficult for  these men to come back to the mainland to be surrounded by people who  understand nothing of their experiences.  They are happy to be away from  the fighting, but the men they shared those days with, seem to be the only  reality they accept.<br />Jones passed away before the book was complete,  and the last few chapters read like cliffs notes, but it doesn't lessen the  power of this story.	2000-03-04

It's obvious pretty early on that Crowe is a student of Wilder's work.  He knows about the most obscure  movies and remembers the anecdotes he's read from the many Wilder  biographies.  Wilder answers everything with humor and grace.  His memory  is exceptional as he recalls details such as Bogart spitting when he talked  in SABRINA, Joe DiMaggio's reaction to the SEVEN YEAR ITCH, and the  disasterous 1st preview of SUNSET BOULEVARD (The audience laughed at the  original beginning).  Besides the interview Crowe also recounts his efforts  to convince Wilder to take a small but important role in JERRY MCGWIRE.  Wilder feigned interest, but ultimately declined the offer.  I also liked  that Crowe got Wilder's take on Marylin Monroe's &quot;suicide.&quot;  Later though, you wonder if that opinion had more to do with his love of  John F. Kennedy than his own independent analysis.  Either way, you leave  the book wishing that Wilder had been making pictures these past 20 years.	2000-02-18

As I read it, I could hear Mr. Maple tell the story.  The story he tells is one of how New York City reduced crime in the 1990s.  The reason is Jack Maple.  Maple describes in  several well-told anecdotes his experiences as a transit cop and later  deputy commissioner of the force.  He describes stupid crooks and brilliant  ones.  He describes good cops and bad cops.  He describes good police  policy and bad police policy.  He makes it all entertaining.  He doesn't  give Mayor Gulliani credit for the reduction in crime, he slyly gives it to  himself.  He also describes his later experiences in New Orleans and how  the same principles applied to reduce crime there as well.  What does he  do?  He mostly introduced common sense things with a lot of communication  and a lot of follow-up.  Like any good story, it is in the telling.	2000-02-10

The Angstrom's belong to a club.  They pal around with the rich element in town.  Rabbit's son  Nelson is starting to take after his father in some negative ways.<br />The  living characters from the previous novels all show up again.  Rabbit  spends much of his time reflecting not only basketball, but people now  dead, and his own mortality.  His marriage is now stable, though always  dysfunctional, and he realizes he is entering into the 2nd half of his  life.<br />Money hasn't made Rabbit any happier.  If anything he was much  more easy-going when he worked with his father as a printer.<br />The book,  like the others, ends in a false hope happy ending.

The people are described according to how Jack feels about them as human beings.  Jack loved Nelson Rockefeller.  Jack hated Richard Nixon.  Jack was fascinated by George  Wallace.  Jack hasn't liked a president since Jimmy Carter.  This is indeed  interesting as Carter may be the smartest nicest president we have ever  had, but it doesn't do much to explain why Carter was an absolute failure  at the job.  He had many criticisms about Reagan, Bush and Clinton, but he  has little to say about the 20 years of sustained economic growth  maintained by them.<br />Jack writes that he is interested in the horse race  aspect of politics mostly.  Who is winning and who is losing. These stories  he tells well.  I particularly like his days covering the New York state  house.  His &quot;to hell with it&quot; style throughout is quite  entertaining and the book's best asset, but I wanted more meat and less  milk.	2000-01-14

Any of these things would have made Rabbit run before,  now none of these circumstances to seem to have any penatrating effect on  rabbit.<br />The book deals with some then contemporary issues in some very  interesting ways.  Updike's look at racism, flower children, teenagers, the  old, the young, morality, and immorality are still fresh today.  The book  itself is every bit as good as the initial one.	2000-01-05

He loves the men from C for Charlie Company.  They are the story.  He describes many events that comprise a battle,  the transport, the encampment, the waiting, the  shelling, the shooting, the fighting, the bravery, the cowardice.  We enter  the minds of those who fight.  Some fight for politcal advancement.  Some  fight for fear of being labled a coward.  Some fight just becuase they love  the company and men they're fighting with. The main characters are John  Bell, a former engineering officer who resigns his commission to be with  his wife.  He opens the story as a lowly private.  The fear of being killed  hardly enters his mind.  He's too worried that his wife is cheating on him  to think about anything else.  Corporal Fife, the company clerk and coward,  learns to fight and love it.  1st Sergeant Welsh is the madman leader of  the non-coms who does surprisingly little fighting.  He likes to walk  around and stir the pot.  This is probably due to his two canteens full of  gin.  There are many other important characters, but interesting to me is a  minor one named Witt.  Witt, is the doppleganger of Private Robert E. Lee  Prewitt from Jones first book of the trilogy From Here to Eternity.  Witt,  like Prewitt is a strong willed Kentuky boy who was once a regimental  boxer. In this book he drifts in and out of the company as it suits him.  The 1998 movie focuses on him much more than the novel.<br />If you are  interested in World War II, you'll enjoy this book.	1999-12-13

Matthews begins by recalling his background in politics and journalism, which is quite extensive.  By 1988, he had already worked for a Senator, a  President, and a Speaker of the house.<br />The basic theme is how to play  politics, or more specifically, how to win at politics.  He has a couple of  hardball theories.  My favorite is the politician that loses the public  fight but wins the greater policy victory.  He explains in detail how  Ronald Regean was able to sway congress in supporting the Contras in  Central America by using their language with his policy.<br />Many other  things in the book seem like common sense or too easy, but Matthews shows  how they work.  He explains how Lyndon Johnson made his way from  Congressional Secretary to Representative, to Senator, to Senate Majority  Leader and later President.  Johnson simply got to know people.  He found  what a person wanted, and then delivered when he could.  This would almost  always create a supporter.  Johnson knew that if he could get some  congressman's bridge built he would have that guy's vote later.<br />Also  interesting how he compares Washington politics with everyday office  politics and how these lessons apply to most everyone.	1999-12-09

Rabbitt Angstrom was the star of his high school basketball team 8 years prior.  Nothing in his life has been equally rewarding.  In fact, he can hardly cope with life as a nobody.  He stills has enough charm to warm over  the local pastor or a widowed lady, and the coach is still there for  advice, but his life is going no where.<br />The novel opens with Rbbitt a  salesman of a household device.  His wife is a pregnant alcoholic and he  already has a two-year old son.  No crowds cheer anymore.  His wife has  left the car at her parents and the son at his parents, and while you're  out Rabbitt pick up a pack of cigarettes.  Angstrom has had enough and the  run begins.<br />It has been said that there are no sympathetic characters and  that is somewhat true, but the story is real.  Some of my contemporaries  still live their high school years over and over.  They still want to tell  you how someone they played ball with is doing.  They still play ball.  There lives change very little over the years otherwise they will lose that  varsity feeling.  This story represents that very well.	1999-11-29

I was surprised then at how even-handedly he treated his subjects.<br />He describes the Kennedy flaws quite aptly.  He  lays out the Nixon virtues in quite the same way.<br />It begins with Kennedy  and Nixon both elected to the house of representatives in 1946.  Kennedy  was jovial and light.  Nixon was quite a serious young man.  Nixon went to  the senate first.  Kennedy made it to the Senate when Nixon became  vice-president.  The men had a cordial relationship.<br />In 1946 they went  to Pennsyvannia to debate.  Afterwards they ate dinner together in a local  diner.  On the train trip back to Washington they flipped a coin for the  bottom bunk.  Richard Nixon was a Guest at John and Jackie's wedding.  They  were both guests at Senator Joe McCarthy's wedding.<br />They would have  remained cordial until they went against each other in the 1960  presidential contest.<br />Matthews shows how this loss at the hands of John  Kennedy changed the way he saw politics.  In a way Matthews blames the  kennedy's for Nixon's ethical demise.  Nixon felt the Kennedy's stole the  election and decided no more Mr. Nice Guy.  The culmination of this would  lead to Nixon's resignation some 14 years later.<br />I left the book liking  both Kennedy and Nixon as men and Presidents more than when I picked it up.	1999-11-29

Lee Prewitt and 1st Sergeant Milton Warden were more interesting than any two characters from any book that I can remember.  Each with their own code  that occassionally jives with the Army code.  Jones has a sharp mind and  his characters do much philosophizing.  Prewitt spends his time looking for  the answers and living up to his own code.  He never makes it easy on  himself.  He always takes the tough way.<br />Warden, who seems more in  control than any character in the book, will occassionaly take a dangerous  risk just out of boredom.<br />An earlier review stated that Prewitt was too  smart for his education, but it struck me odd that Warden had read most of  the books on Prewitt's &quot;to read&quot; list.  Where does a First  Sergeant get that much time to read?<br />The relation between men and women  in this book was also quite interesting.  As is the relationship between  the soldiers themselves.<br />Give it a look.  I'm moving onto The Thin Red  Line.	1999-11-22

I especially like his chapter per film approach.  There is an awful lot of behind the scenes stuff from even the more obscure movies.  I couldn't believe how much was  written about the Emporer Waltz and Fedora.  If you like Wilder, give it a  read.	1999-09-02

A great place to start for any aspiring artist.	1999-08-15

Jo was an artist herself  and her frustrations are paralled with Edward's successes.  Maybe too much  of the book is about poor Mrs. Hopper and her unsuportive Husband, but  Levin crafts the history so well that I didn't hold it against her.  Each  of the major oil paintings are covered from a making-of perspective which I  found illuminating.  I picked the book up originally just to glance through  it, but I ultimately read the whole thing.	1999-08-13

Maybe even more interesting is his tale of the goings on at a major publishing house during a forty year period.  I learned a lot about the  business and enjoyed the anecdotes no little.	1999-08-02

Orwell's great analytical skills take you through Paris and London during the depression.  Little comments about the cleanliness of restaurants  elicits pages of commentary and it is all gold.  I'm glad I picked it up.	1999-08-02

It never did.  Maybe I wasn't in the mood for one of those deep introspective books.  I probably just wanted a good story.  Henderson never interested me.  I  never felt like the journey was worth continuing.  The character was just  plain dull.	1999-08-02

His first story on McSorley's Irish Pub prompted my visit to same last week when I visited NY.  The visit made me pick up Mitchell's book and read it all over again.  Every story is worthwhile despite subjects that would, at first, seem  uninteresting. His profile of Joe Gould was one of the best pieces of  non-fiction writing I can recall.  If only a dozen guys in the world could  write this way about real people.	1999-07-28

McGee travels from Fort Lauderdale to Mexico and Los Angeles to seek the killers of an old friend. Plenty of action and self-righteous commentary.  Travis McGee is thoroughly readable.  A great book series that should live  well beside Chandler and Stout.	1999-02-16
