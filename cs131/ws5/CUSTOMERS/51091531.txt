I always find it interesting to read about the different money making oppurtunities that they create, and in Vegas boy did they find a jackpot! Because I have read other mob books I was familiar with some of the names mentioned in the book and their backgrounds. The movie Casino has been around for 10 yrs. and I refused to watch it until I had read the book, well I rented it as soon as I finised the book and was very pleased with how the movie followed the book. It was good to have all the inside info that the book gave me as watched the movie. If you're into mob stuff I have to believe you will like this book.	2005-05-04

This book is a book to read and enjoy. I really enjoyed this book from cover to cover. From simple beginnings, Vito Corleone is able to become a man with much power and influence. He runs his family buisness like a well oiled (olive?) machine. All the members of the family come to life in this novel as each do their part to keep the buisness running. Other characters in the book equally come to life as they play parts that inter-weave with the family. This book had me on a kind of rollercoaster with the goings on with the different family members. We get a look at how the young Vito started in the family buisiness all the way up to where Michael the youngest son assumes leadership of the family. Everything in between makes for some of the best reading I've come across in a long time.	2002-12-17

Do not short change yourself by watching a movie version of this classic,you'll miss too much! I really liked this book about a man wrongly accused and imprisoned. Edmond Dantes is sent to prison and there he meets his benefactor, a man many believe is crazy. This so called crazy man teaches Edmond everything from foreign languages to science, these will come in handy once Edmond is able to put into action his plans for revenge on those who are responsible for his stay in prison. Edmond is finally able to escape from prison after many years (I can't tell you how, read the book!) and is now able to seek revenge on those who have wronged him in the past. Now the fun part starts as Edmond begins to piece by piece ruin the lives of his enemies who have long forgotten that Edmond might still exist. I can't tell you what the Count of Monte Cristo has in store for these people you will have to find out for yourself and you're sure not to be dissappointed!	2001-05-29

I havent read any books by Patterson before and happened to find this complete story on CD. It was a pretty entertaining story about some mad scientist doing some crazy experiments on humans so that they could fly and be superior to other humans. Everything was going alright until a couple of the 'guinea pigs' escaped from the compound and reveal themselves to the local vet who just happens to have a husband that mysteriously died a few yrs back. From there the story takes off on all kinds of twists and turns that kept me interested in this story. I will be looking at reading other Patterson books after being entertained by this story.	2001-04-09

It is a short story that most of us are familiar with but may have not taken the time to actually read. I have seen versions of it on TV, movies, and this year even seen a good performance of it done in a play. This year I decided to pick up the book and devote a little bit of time to reading the story. It of course is a classic written by one of the greatest writers ever, Charles Dickens. The story has a lot of meaning and reminds us that we should be aware of how we treat others not only at Christmas time but in all we do. Ebenezer Scrooge may be in us all at one time or another but like him there is time for redemption if we allow ourselves to reflect and appreciate what we have and are  willing to be giving of ourselves to others.	2001-01-01

This was a well written book on the many Polar and African interior explorations that were sponsored by the British in the first half of the 19th centry. From trying to find the North-West Passage above North America to searching for the legendary &quot;city of gold&quot; called Timbucto in Africa this book kept me interested throughout. Never before or for that matter since has such a group of explorers been assembled. The man responsible for these quests was John Barrow, a man who had a dream of mapping uncharted areas of the world. He set into motion the largest and most expensive series of explorations in the history of mankind. This is a story of courage and determination like no other that I have read before. This book recounts the stories of men who spent years stuck in the freezing cold in their dreams of being the first to find a passage across North America. The book also details the adventures that other men had in their quest to map the interior of Africa. Other stories of different areas in the world that were explored are also included. John Barrow might not have been as successful as he would have liked but his dream inspired later explorers and set a benchmark that carried on into the 20th century.	2000-12-24

I really liked the ingenuity that these POW's used in their attempts to escape. The book describes the problems that the escapees were faced with as they planned an escape and how these problems were eventually solved. The way the book details some of the German guards was interesting also because some guards were helpful in making the great escape possible. The book that I read was the paperback version and had many drawings that give you an idea of what the camp and tunnels looked like. I did run into the hardback copy later and found that it contained actual photos from the prison camp and had actual pictures of the tunnels and of some of the participants both German and Allied. I give this book a thumbs up for anyone looking for a book that offers a different look of WWII, one from inside a German POW camp.	2000-12-22

I had never read any books on the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan but had been curious about it for some time. This book answers some of the questions that I had and revealed things that I had no knowledge of. The book follows the lives of five people who were in Hiroshima at the time of the bomb dropping. It chronicles the people, places and horrors that they were witness to after the bomb had devasted there homes and lives in Hiroshima. The book was written shortly after these events took place so the stories and feelings that are related in the book are fresh and vivid. Not since Hiroshima and Nagasaki has mankind been subjected to such devastating destruction. This story should never be forgotten for fear of repeating this sad time in history.	2000-12-15

I am reading Transfer of Power also by V. Flynn but have that book at work so I decided to catch up with Flynn by listening to Term Limits on audio at home and I enjoyed it. I normally dont like a condensed version of a book but I have so many books that I want to read that I thought that I could save some time by doing it this way. It was pretty cool to be able to pop the tape in to my car cassette player and listen to the story as I ran around doing errands and then at home just put on some headphones and listen to it as I kicked back. I even had my wife listening to this story with great interest. While I did like the story I have to say that in all honesty that I am really enjoying Tranfer of Power more. Vince Flynn is a good writer and I recommend either of these two books to anyone who might be looking for a good political thriller!	2000-12-13

It is well written with great discriptions of what life was like in New York in the 1800's. Equally sad and revealing is this story of one of the last Indians in the New York regions. It is a story of a boy who in the 1920's happens upon an aged Indian who has to to tell his story to someone so that it is never forgotten. The Indian, Joe Two Trees, does in fact have a story that should be told over and over so that we should not forget that at one time he and his people were really the first Americans on this continent. This is a story that should be shared with any children that you have.	2000-10-04

I look at the hills and open fields around  me and I think of these people travelling endless miles and wonder how they  did what they did.I go outside on a cold day and think about these people  being stuck up in the cold mountains and how they attempted to escape from  the numerous snow blizzards.

A friend at work let me borrow this book and after I finally got around to starting it I could hardly put it down. This book seems to be very accurate in its  presentation. Written in the 1930's it has proven to be timeless in its  depiction of the endless setbacks that the Donner Party encountered while  on their quest for the promised land of California. One of the things that  I learned and that made an impression on me was that their hardships  started long before they even arrived at what is now known as Donner Lake.  I highly reccommend this book to anyone who has ever heard of the Donner  Party and may have never had the chance to really read up on the subject.  This book is also a great read for all those who have an interest in the  opening of the western frontier in the 1800's. This is definately one of  those books that can be said to be memorable.	2000-03-29

Just finished reading this book today and thought that it was really good. Myself, being from the San Francisco Bay Area, I was thrilled to hear Dana describe areas that I am well familiar with. The book was a history lesson  for me of early California. My book, the Penguin Classic edition, had an  extra chapter at the end written by Dana called &quot;Twenty-four Years  After&quot;. In this chapter he returns to California 24 yrs later and  writes about all the changes that have occurred since he was last  there, a  lot due to the fact of the gold rush. He also goes into some detail on the  whereabouts of his former crewmates and the two ships that he sailed on  while on his adventure. I have to say that this book probably would have  more appeal to someone who is familiar with California as I am. I'm not  sure if the book centered on Oregon lets say, that I would have enjoyed it  as much as I did. I picked this book up at a second-hand store and am glad  I decided to give it a try. I would suggest the same for anyone else that  may have an interest in how it was to work and live on ships in the 1800's  and early California before statehood.	2000-03-21

It was  classic Crichton in the sense that like all his books he did some heavy  research into the subject that he writes about.

I mean how many times can  the main characters get into near death situations and then find a way out  of their predicaments?.In this book it happens coutless times.
