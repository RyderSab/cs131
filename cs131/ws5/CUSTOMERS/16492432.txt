The character Juicy was dumb, and playing with fire. I just could not understand why this girl could not sit her hot self down and relax! Wait until the old man (G) die! I think in some of the situations she was asking for some of the punishments! Sneaking out the bed Juicy to get with the son! Girl you gotta to be crazy! All the while knowing you sleeping with the enemy! Sleeping with an Ike & Tina type cat! Juicy's brother Jimmy in the beginning of this book I really did not like him because he was a follower but I soon found out that he had no other examples to lead him so I understood his role. But in the end he really pulled through for Juicy and that brought tears to my eyes! Great job author because I could not put it down!	2005-06-04

I would like to start off by saying this was one of our book clubs choices and one major complaint was the editing. I know things are not perfect but TRIPLE CROWN you guys got to get it together! This is not the first book that I read published by this company and the editing was bad. I am not one to look at a book and critique the errors, misspelled words, and grammar. But come on you guys. You can't hold the crown if you don't have the ability to publish a book without errors! With that said I think this book was a good read. I found myself crying because I could relate to the main character.  It also had parts that had me laughing out loud. As for the character Taj I hope there is a man out there for me like this guy he was great!	2005-05-02

Nice job author.	2005-04-26
US	16492432	R2T04OZVJZ74KO	0974363685	342702466	The Womanizers	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Straight to the dirt.	Ok this book was off the hook! Took me about three days to read. The character Mike was just a dirty dog! Instead of being a police officer he should have been the k-9 on the police force. I don't understand why his wife Mya did not leave him long time ago before she caught some deadly disease! He got what he deserved! Every dog has its day! Then there was Max he was married to a woman who accepted him for what he was absolutely nothing! This man was sleeping with his mother-in-law! It does not get any dirtier than that. If it was my book it would not be much to say about this Max character because he and my mother would have had a double funeral in the second chapter. Then there was Ahmed a good man gone badly by the power of an evil woman (MYA). Ok it wasn't all her fought but Mya where was the sisterhood at how could you do Shay (Ahmed wife) like that! You want to mess up another halfway happy home because yours is not right. It figures! Shay how could you cause so much confusion in your marriage because of your insecurities! You almost lost a good man. He is your husband for better or worst this character should have got over I am not having sex with my husband because I am fat attitude! If I was Ahmed I would have tried to divorce her. With holding sex for six months is against the law in my book! Then there is Trina (Max's wife) I have one question for this character what woman in her right mind would accept her husband back after sleeping with her mother? A desperate one maybe?????? Like I said Sharon (Trina's mom) & Max either a double funeral or buried in a position they were familiar with on top of each other!    Overall this book was a nice read but I really think that this author kind of draged it on for a while with unnecessary chapters. To much beating around the bush. Get straight to the dirt.	2005-04-25

The main character Pammy/Carmen was unbelievably stupid in this novel! This woman had all the street smarts in the world she could tell you how to turn a ten dollars into a million, but when it came down to deciding if she would snitch or stay. She's unsure! I screaming as I read tell you fool! You have a one-year-old kid and he needs his mother. How can you be torn between being a snitch and being a mother! I know she had to do what she had to do to get by but your first obligation is your child not the damn streets. I think the author spent too much time on this issue! I also felt that this girl still had love for Chino after all he had done! I am sorry baby daddy after you left me and married another women (this happen in the first book Let that be the Reason) not claiming my child and refusing to take care of mines I am sorry Chino but you would have been in jail in the first book because I would snitched about ya run ins with them people you laid to rest! If mines can't eat. Nobody want eat! The person that really had love for Carmen/Pammy was murder violently this part of the book kind of upset me I just wished it could have happen a different way. This book is basically about the main character locked up in jail about to do major time and she torn between being a snitch or being a solider doing her time. All the time she's in jail people are living their lives especially the man that she stuck her neck out there for (her baby daddy). The end of the novel had me a bit confused I am wondering did this author  want us to imagine how the ending should be. Like I said before and I am going to say it again I will be a snitch any day (yeah some of yall saying that snitches get stitches) but you gotta catch me first!	2005-04-13

I hated him. No I really hated him. I did not like how the charcters had so much respect for this beast. And poor little Annette keep this secret and never revealed the secret because it would break her mother's heart.
