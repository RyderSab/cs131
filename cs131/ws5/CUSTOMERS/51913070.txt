It's challenging for any author to cover so much backstory in so short a novel.  I don't think Maguire could have done anything differently, except make the initial chapters and explanations a little more compressed to keep the action moving.  <br /> <br />Liir, our mystery man and the alledged son of Elphaba, literally falls from the sky on a remote convent.  The Maunt assigns Candle, a mute Quadling with a gift for music, the task of nursing the young man back to health.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, in Liir's head, we're seeing what's happened since Elphaba's death.  We finally see the trip to Oz, his dealings with Glinda, etc.   <br /> <br />Candle's and Liir's backstory alternate til Liir wakes up.  This is about page 250 and the most interesting part of the book, IMHO.   <br /> <br />While reading SON OF A WITCH was quite a trudge, I will say that I would probably read another book in this series if it took place more in the present day.	2005-10-12

Usually, I can't put a Nightside book down.  This time, I couldn't pick it back up.  \\"Paths Not Taken\\" is a good bridge between the earlier Nightside novels where John Taylor does not know his heritage and the discovery that he is the son of Lilith.  In this book, John, Tommy Oblivion, and Suzie Shooter go back in time to try and discover the origin of the Nightside so they can stop Lilith from eventually destroying the Nightside in the future.  The first 200 or so of the pages of the book are slow-paced.  We do find out how Merlin Satanspawn loses his heart.  At the last when the action gets moving, the book is interesting.  Pity it ends too soon and begins too slowly.  Green does set us up for continuing interest in future novels.  I do want to stay tuned just to see what happens between him and Suzie.	2005-09-14

Her two (anti) heroes are a pair of down-and-outers who are stranded in the boondocks and agree to help Loretta, the proprieter of Gil's All Night Diner, remove her zombies and replace her gas line.  <br /> <br />Wow!  Not just supernatural pest control, but plumbers as well!   <br /> <br />Neither member of this scurrilous pair, Duke of Werewolves and Earl of Vampires, is anything special to look at.  Duke has a beer belly.  Earl doesn't exactly possess the legendary vampiric charm.   <br /> <br />The situations Martinez puts this pair into are extraordinary: Zombie cows, dealing with Sheriff Marshall Kopp, dealing with a poor put-upon ghost stuck as keeper of her graveyard.  <br /> <br />\\"Gil's All Fright Diner\\" keeps you turning pages wondering what whacky and outrageous thing Martinez will get this dysfunctional duo in next.  If you get the book, give yourself time to read the 280-approximate pages in as close to one sitting as you can.  It's well worth the time.	2005-08-30

While there certainly is a fantasy element in \\"Last Girl\\" the mystery-thriller far overrides all else.  Warning:  this is a book that's hard to put down.  Lisle writes compelling and sympathetic characters and imbeds enough hook into the tale to leave you turning pages well into the night.  The one downside is I'm not sure I enjoyed the view of the strip clubs.  Ms. Lisle did her research well--she managed to give her strippers vivid character.  <br /> <br />The plot:  A trio of serial murderers is killing strippers in one of Atlanta's best strip clubs, Goldcastle.  Police detective, Jess Brubeck, is called in to go undercover--as a stripper.  This is her big break to become one of the Grand Old Men of Crime--and secretly her hope to find out who killed her twin sister Ginny 13 years before.  <br /> <br />But, things do not go as well as she'd have liked.  She's teamed up with a psychic.  Enough of those fakes took her for everything she was worth when her sister disappeared.  But this one, Hank Kamien, is the real thing.  The Ex-Ranger who gained his powers at the cost of scars over half his body is the Real Thing.  Jess and Hank quickly suspect the attraction they feel for each other is the Real Thing, too.  <br /> <br />\\"Last GIrl\\" is definitely a tough, gritty novel with some interesting surprises.  This is a departure from much of Lisle's fantasy writing, which could be termed for more of a family audience.  Definitely worth setting aside several hours to read if you are a thriller fan.	2005-08-23

Roman Dragonesti is a vampire with a problem.  He's lost his right fang in possibly the most embarrassing manner there is and there are no vampire dentists.  If he doesn't get his fang back in by dawn, he'll go through the rest of his life a one-sided eater.  <br /> <br />Shanna is a dentist working the late-night shift in an emergecy clinic because she can't stand the sight of blood.  She's also trying to hide out from the folks who made her frightened---who coincidentally will kill her if they find her... <br /> <br />Of course, Roman has to come to her clinic the night Shanna's pursuers catch up.  Can he save her?  Can she get his fang back in on time?  Can this mis-matched pair find true happiness?  <br /> <br />I haven't laughed so hard in years.  \\"How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire\\" is just as funny as any of the Stephanie Plum (Janet Evanovich) novels and early Anita Blake (Laurell K. Hamilton).  The author has a way of writing a hook at the end of each chapter that makes you hold your breath til you can turn over the next page!	2005-08-16

The reason this book did not earn four stars from me is because of the forced dialog.  Card was respectful--and in some ways--too respectful of his African American characters.  To me, it sounded like what it was--a white man writing black dialogue.  Also, the setup was slow and subtle.  I'll admit right now I am not used to Card's rhythm and it took me a bit to get comfortable reading him.   <br /> <br />The 'hero' of this tale is Mack Street.  Newborn Mack was found in a grocery sack in his LA neighborhood.  Cecil (Ceese) one of the two kids who found him took him to the neighborhood nurse, who ended up naming and fostering Mack.  Early on, Mack has 'cold dreams'.  These represent the deepest desires of a person.  One of the critical points in this book is when Mack dreams of Tamika, the neighborhood swimming champion wishing she were a fish.  Tamika's parents wake up to find their daughter in their waterbed.   <br /> <br />Eerie events follow Mack.  He seems \\"Bagman\\" a homeless man that few others see and a black-clad female motorcycle rider, who definitely is interested in him.  The story slowly unfolds, but is harder to put down once the rather lengthy setup is done.   <br /> <br />\\"Magic Street\\" was definitely worthwhile, though initially hard to get into, and I will look for some of Card's other works.	2005-08-11

She awakens in what feels like a box.  She has food, water, a flashlight---all it takes to survive, but she's not sure what the kidnapper really wants--is it a ransom or something else?<br /><br />\\"Body Double\\" is an extremely well-written medical thriller from internist-turned-author Tess Gerritson.  Every chapter has hooks designed to imbed deep and leave you guessing, wanting to read on.  Maura Isles, the main voice of the novel and pregnant cop, Jane Rizzoli, as well as Mattie Purvis in her captivity keep the fast-paced action human and personal.  These three heroic women take a mundane novel and turn it into something hard to put down.<br /><br />Definitely going to check out the rest of the Maura Isles novels by Gerritson.	2005-08-10

They're funny, smart, sexy--but not too overpowering. \\"You Slay Me\\" the prequel to this novel was the first of MacAllister's work that I've read and probably will not be my last. If I could give this one a 4 and a half star rating, I would.  It's worth that, but no way am I going to rate it as high as \\"You Slay Me.\\"  <br /> <br />While I enjoyed \\"FIre Me Up\\" I can't say I was as enthused as I was about its predecessor.  MacAllister did successfully run a romance, mystery, and comedy at the same time in \\"You Slay Me.\\"   <br /> <br />\\"Fire Me Up\\" had many of the same elements working.  Of course, Aisling shows up in Hungary to discover that Drake is there.  It's almost too easy that they get back together with all the problems they had and too predictable what happened.   <br /> <br />The mystery didn't really get in full swing til about page 200, which was a long setup.  I guessed pretty accurately whodunit, so she wasn't as tricky as \\"You Slay Me.\\"  <br /> <br />Probably my biggest complaint was that Jim got sidelined for a good chunk of the book.  I'll admit right now, I love that demon dog.  He makes the series for me.	2005-08-07

Four months later, Claudette's wealthy father hires Faye to help the family solve the murder.   <br /> <br />What follows is a both a mystery and a mini-history of New York City during the last world war.  Faye's a sharp cookie, with the shamus lingo down pat.  The mystery's weak--I guessed whodunit pretty quickly---but the history is wonderful.  Just an example:  did you know that silk was rationed because it was used in parachutes?  Women couldn't get stockings, so they made up their legs even going so far as to draw the seam down the back of their legs with eyeliner.   <br /> <br />Overall, an interesting read and an enjoyable one.	2005-08-05

Plus, the Hawklord has placed a containment on Kaylin's magic:  a device that no one clearly understands the use of.   <br /> <br />The worlds Sagara has created is fascinating and well realized.  She handles the inclusion of separate races:  leonine, avian, and draconian very well.  Overall, a good mystery within a fantasy plot.  Also, while the book is a serial, enough questions are answered about this present plot to not leave readers dangling til the next book comes out.	2005-08-04

They didn't start out to be the \\"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.\\"  <br /> <br />Actually, about 16 years before, their trendy 1980's Moms started out as the \\"Septembers\\" in a prenatal work out class at an exercise salon called Gilda's.  The four mothers became friends.  Their daughters (and one twin son) were born within 17 days of each other. <br /> <br />As time went on, the mothers lost that friendship to careers, family, and other concerns, but the daughters continued on.   <br /> <br />They're 15 now and this is their first summer apart.  Lena (the beautiful one) is going to Greece to visit her Grandparents for teh first time.  Bridget aka Bee (the athlete) is going to soccer camp in Baja, Carmen (who doesn't quite know who she is) is going to spend her first summer with her Dad, who'd divorced her Mom several years before.  Tibby, (the Goth) is going to stay home and work at Wallman's drug.  She's going to film a documentary (she calls it a suckumentary) about how bad her summer is going to be.  <br /> <br />On the eve of their separation, they discover a pair of jeans that fit them all.  This is no mean feat since Carmen is bodacious, Bee is tall and lanky, etc.   <br /> <br />The book is the story of how the pants see them through a summer  of growth apart and also bind them together.  I saw the film before I read the book and I love both of them.  This is not common.  I don't really like these kinds of stories, but Brashears writes engaging and heart-warming characters.  This book is definitely a must for women of all ages who want to capture the spirit of sisterhood.	2005-08-03

Lena is trying to reconcile herself to the loss of her first love---and reconcile her family to her desire for a career in art instead of restaurant management.  <br /> <br />While not as much of a page-turner as the first three books, I still thoroughly enjoyed the book and would read a fourth if it came out.	2005-08-03

Tony has moved out of Fitzroy's home and is now working as a production assistant on TV show \\"Darkest Night\\", which ironically is a fictional show about a vampire detective.     <br /> <br />In the first episode, Tony and Henry defeat a Shadowlord planning to possess the cast and crew of \\"Darkest Night\\".  Tony discovers he has wizard powers and must somehow manage to control them.  In my opinion, the backstory from \\"Shadows\\" was a critical part left out in \\"Mirrors.\\"  Just a few paragraphs would have made \\"Mirrors\\" a more stand-alone book.   <br /> <br />In \\"Mirrors\\" the cast and crew is filming a haunted house story---in a haunted house.  Of course, they don't know that when the Boss probably got a cut-rate price on rental of the site....When one of the crew gets cut, the malevolence in the house comes alive.  All doors shut at dusk and the deaths of the malevolence's victims is played over and over....The pattern is---murder, then suicide, and each one of the multiple deaths is a separate story in itself.  <br /> <br />They'll be freed---if they can survive the night.  Meanwhile, cast members are slowly going crazy and suspicious of one another. Tony, the low person on the totem pole, is a very suspicious character in most's book because he's the only one who can both see and communicate with the ghosts. His powers are untrained and most don't even believe in them---making him a likely target to be 'kicked off the island' by suspicious higher ranking cast members.   <br /> <br />Add to that all the histrionics of show biz folks, stir in the Boss' two pre-teen daughters, Tony's unrequited lust for the show's co-star, and oh yeah, a warning not to go in the basement.   <br /> <br />\\"Mirrors\\" is defintely a good, fast-paced read, but not the book it could have been.  The backstory from the first book is necessary for new readers and even those of us who bought \\"Shadows\\" in hardcover a year or so ago.  Still,  I'll go out on a limb and say I'll still buy the next book in the series.  <br />	2005-07-31

I thought it was an excellent fantasy novel with an interesting romance angle thrown in.  In her second book, Laura Ann Gilman isn't making either the fantasy or the romance angles work that well for me.   <br /> <br />The concept:  Wren is a Retriever.  Basically, she goes and steals back items that are taken by others.  Sergei is her manager/partner.  He's in his 40's, about 20 years older than she.  They're in love, though neither is actively acknowledging it til this novel.   <br /> <br />\\"Curse the Dark\\" sends the two of them after stolen Catholic Church relics.  We get a better explanation than the initial one about the 'CosaNostradamus' the organization that controls mages and the 'Silence' the organization that makes sure the 'Cosa' is on the up-and-up.   <br /> <br />\\"Curse the Dark\\" crosses a few more barriers than \\"Staying Dead\\" by introducing a mystery line--just what are the relics, what do they mean, and why are they protected so strongly against mages? And, finally, who but a mage could steal them?  Gilman's good at setting up mystery, but her explanations are somewhat muddy.  <br /> <br />\\"Curse\\" answers a few of the questions I had from \\"Staying Dead\\" but doesn't leave me looking forward to the sequel or as excited about new-author Gilman as I previously was.   <br /> <br />I'm not sure I will read #3 next year.  Will definitely have to sit down and make sure I can get through the first chapter or two before I commit to it.  Feels as though Gilman is trying to please too many audiences at once and not doing very well at any of it.	2005-07-29

Suspend disbelief, and you're okay.     \\"Brother's Price\\" is the second departure novel from the Ukiah Oregon novels and in this reviewer's opinion, not as well written or explained as Ukiah's stories or \\"Tinker.\\"     In \\"Brother's Price\\" women far outnumber men. The few males who are born are wed to households of women and serve as the father to many children. The title refers to the 'bride price' of a male child.      \\"Brother's Price\\" is told from the point of view of Jerin Whistler, a young male coming of age and about to be sold, and Princess Ren, one of the women soon to be one of the Queens of the Realm. They exist in a beginning Industrial Age--germs have just been detected, they are capable of forming steel into ships.    We open with Jerin taking a grave risk,  he urges his sisters to rescue a soldier who was found injured near their spring by outlaws.  Turns out, the soldier is a Princess of the Realm.  They're due to be rewarded by 'sponsorship' of their family into Royal Court.  This means, the handsome Jerin is going to receive a lot of attention and hopefully, a good price.     The Whistlers have just managed to score a coup--purchase of a store.  Land generally is held in families for generations, but the unlucky Picker family lost their man and was barely able to hold onto their fortune, so their store's being sold for their old age.  Jerin must fetch a high price, else his family might be ruined, too---the expense of the store would be what they would spend on a husband to start a new generation.    Meanwhile, both Princess Ren and Jerin need to find out who is stealing valuable cannons and attacking their soldiers.  The future of the Realm and both families may depend on this knowledge.     Just read the book.  Don't wonder why or how the situation got as it is.  That takes the fun out of the reading.  The pacing is off in this novel.  Without giving away too much of the plot, the court manipulations are too long and drawn out.  We get to the point where Jerin discovers a key fact too late in the novel.  The last chapters are real page turners, but properly written, the whole book could and should be a page turner.	2005-07-27

In a previous episode, she committed herself to Algaliarept (Big Al for short) to put a drug dealing 'undead' vampire Piscary in jail.  She figures the price was worth it, seeing as she'd be dead otherwise and the vamp's evil would continue.  <br /> <br />So, she starts out repaying the deal to Big Al and managing to slip him.  Of course, she cannot go into a ley-line for magic anytime soon or Big Al will get her.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, since Piscary's out of action, the bosses of Cincinnati are duking it out.  Piscary's 'scion' Ivy, who is also Rachel's partner, doesn't want to have anything to do with Piscary's business.  So, Kisten, the former scion is running things.  A new threat, Saladan is moving in---selling more dangerous drugs and trying to take over gambling and the other gangland interests.   <br /> <br />Rachel's challenge in this book is to keep out of Big Al's way while she's trying to keep the city she loves safe.  The intro is somewhat slow, but the finish makes up for it.  Definitely have some time to spare when you start reading this book because you will not want to put it down!	2005-07-23

Since the demon they seek is incorporeal, she must find the object the demon is coming for and claim it before the demon can.   <br /> <br />The problem is--Kate's last exercise was toting a two-year-old while pushing a shopping cart around.  When she worked, getting physical was her strong point.  Now, she's got to dig through the church archives for information.   <br /> <br />This book kept me laughing and reading til the end.

I can't remember ever not finishing a new Janet Evanovich novel the first day I got one.  \\"Eleven's\\" no different!     \\"Eleven\\" is different from its predecessors in that Stephanie Plum actually takes the advice of I've lost count how many people and quits her bounty hunter job in search of a real job.  She's lucky--she gets the first job she applies for at the button factory, and the second with a local dry cleaners, and the with a fast-food chicken franchise \\"Cluck in a Bucket\\"....all with disastrously funny results.     THe triangle between Steph, Joe Morelli, and Ranger is throbbing with tension.  This is particularly so since Stephanie ends up working for Ranger at Rangeman Security--to keep safe.  Which hunk is going to claim Steph this time--and for how long?  I'm not telling!      Steph is also being stalked by someone who tells her she thought they were dead.  They attack with bullets, fire....Meanwhile, Steph, Ranger, and Joe are all looking for four Trenton men who have disappeared with their cars on the same day.  This plotline is a real mystery folks and had me guessing all the way through the book.  Definitely a great addition to the Plum series....    Oh yeah, and the laughs keep on coming.  Your favorites are here:  Grandma Mazur, the eighty year old teenager, the prospective brother-in-law Albert Kloughn...     All the Stephanie books are better than Prozac and almost as good as chocolate to cheer a person up.      Evanovich is right:  \\"Eleven\\" is DEFINITELY on top.	2005-06-22

If you liked either Tanya Huff's \\"Summon the Keeper\\" series or Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum bounty hunter novels, you are going to LOVE this book.   <br /> <br />MacAllister has a laugh-a-minute dry Scottish wit that keeps you rolling in the aisles through this romantic fantasy romp.  Her lead character, Aisling (Ashling) Grey has just started a new job with her Uncle Damian as a messenger. She has a golden dragon (specifically an aquamanile) to deliver to a French collector.  When she arrives, she discovers the collector dead hanging above an incomplete circle for summoning demons and a devastatingly handsome man named Drake who claims to be with Interpol.  Next thing Aisling knows, Drake has stolen her dragon and she's the prime suspect for the murder.   <br /> <br />The other reviews provide an excellent summation of the particulars of this plot.  What I will say is this is a quick and light read---maybe not one you want to take to quiet environments if you have a tendency to laugh out loud!	2005-06-18

Pam Johnson discusses a wide variety of feline behavior problems in cats' terms so we can form better human-feline cohabitation.   <br /> <br />Her chapters on \\"Old Age\\" and \\"Depression\\" were indispensible in dealing with Rambo.  In addition, Johnson talks about natural remedies rather than having us end up with a generation of doped-up furbabies. Johnson lists the Bach's Flower remedies and their appropriate applications and doseages for felines.   <br /> <br />Excellent read!

When his Pa's around, he's just someone to hit.  When Pa's out drinking the proceeds from their farm away, Nobe's stealing coins from the payphones with a key he's copied from the telephone employee's original.  <br /> <br />Then Pa dies. Nobe's glad.  He's not going to be hit on anymore.  But he's sad for Ma, too. <br /> <br />They can't keep their farm.  Nobe and his Ma have to move into town, away from Nobe's home and the colored friends he's made down the road, Mrs. Mitchell and her son, Isaac. <br /> <br />Nobe quickly learns that Sheriff Leonard who takes them in is not a good man, either.  When the Sheriff shoots Nobe's dog, Rex, instead of allowing the animal to come live with them in town, Nobe swears everlasting hatred and revenge on the man.   <br /> <br />Nobe's also worried that the Sheriff is looking too closely at his Ma.  Ma admits, she'd marry the Sheriff when his invalid wife dies, but Nobe thinks Sheriff Leonard might just be meaner than his Pa.   <br /> <br />Nobe's friend, Isaac, comes back into town from his job in Tulsa and teaches Nobe how to drive his new car.  Isaac works on a section of town called Black Wall Street and he's doing right well--enough to buy both him and his Mama new motorcars and his Mama (Mrs. Mitchell) a victrola. <br /> <br />When Preacher Johnson returns with tales of the Tulsa race riots, Noble borrows the preacher's car to go get Isaac, who the preacher saw being injured.   <br /> <br />There's more, but telling more would spoil the ending.   <br /> <br />The author has taken a little-known event and turned it into a memorable tale of nobility and kindness.  Within 150 short pages, Noble Chase's character grows by leaps and bounds as we see a bit of painful history that some folks meant to never see the light of day.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-02

Hennepin County Sheriff's Deputy Sarah Pribek has more on her plate than she can deal with:    Her husband, Mike Shiloh, is in jail in Wisconsin for stealing a car which he was going to use in the commission of a revenge murder \\"Shorty\\" who'd raped and killed a friend's (and Sarah's former partner's) teenage daughter.     Sarah herself is under suspicion of actually killing \\"Shorty.\\"     Despite not being the motherly type, Sarah's gotten guardianship of a family of five children whose famous author father is incapacitated by a stroke. Her first exposure to the family was when Marlinchen, the eldest daughter, came to Sarah to help her find her missing brother, who'd been given away by their father to a family friend in Georgia.  Marlinchen's brother, Aidan, eventually shows up and the mystery around him grows stronger. The family is not what they seem and the further she digs, the more dark secrets she uncovers.     Finally, she's asked to investigate an unlicensed physician operating out of the local housing projects.  Can she actually bust a man who turns out to be doing so much good in the projects?     Sarah's choices change the destiny of several people, including her own. Sarah's going to have to face some ugly parts of her past--and potentially troublesome future in the next installations of her series.      What I like most about Jodi Compton's work is that it's very realistic police procedural.  No one doing any kind of casework gets things done in a linear fashion.  Deputy Pribek is constantly shifting from one hot issue to another with various incidentals thrown in.      'Sympathy Between Humans\\" is a tough book to read, but a strongly impressive one.  Jodi Compton is definitely an author to watch in the future.	2005-05-29

The concept was interesting, though in my opinion, heavily borrowed from \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\" It seems, beneath the New York Public Library, there is another collection presided over by The Librarian.  Among the artifacts in this collection are Pandora's Box, the Holy Grail, and of course the Spear of Destiny.   <br /> <br />An evil brotherhood manages to steal the one-third of the Spear of Destiny held in this collection.  The Librarian, Flynn Carson, uber nerd and a new hire, has to go after the other two-thirds of the spear before the Brotherhood can unite all three pieces together for their nefarious purposes.  Accompanying him is a too beautiful for words sidekick who can also kick serious butt.   <br /> <br />Great concept, which might have worked save for the excessive silliness and simplicity of the writing.  I really do think this book would be great for Young Adult readers who are not quite ready to go to Harry Potter, but need a start in fantasy.	2005-05-26

Charlaine Harris just keeps getting better and better.  In her fifth addition to the \\"Southern Vampire\\" series, Sookie Stackhouse now has to cope with her brother Jason getting fuzzy once a month (he turns into a werewolf), her boss Sam getting shot, and her old buddy Alcide Herveaux needing her help in--of all things---politics.      Sookie has more on her plate than she can handle, but lucky for her and for us, the Bon Temps, LA barmaid is expert at juggling.  Despite the wild backdrop, Sookie still seems incredibly real.  I enjoy Harris work and hope to continue to do so.  Unlike some of the authors in this genre, Sookie remains a decent and caring person.  The sex in this book is still titillating and for the most part, makes sense in relation to the plot.  Further, any really rough scenes also relate to what's happening with the characters instead of gratuitious violence just thrown in.      Kudos to Harris, if she keeps this up, I could easily read five--or ten--more of the Sookie stories.	2005-05-17

In many ways, he's too good for the band he's playing in, but he's got to keep some road between him and his past.   <br /> <br />It's 1940, San Franciso.  He's playing with the Phil Donovan Orchestra at San Francisco's Claremont Hotel.   <br /> <br />His first day there, he's set out to meet an Attractive Young Woman (by the desk clerk's standards) who left him a note offering him a proposition.  The proposition he gets is from a French Jewish dancer with the Follies Bergere, who wishes to wed an American before she is shipped away.... <br /> <br />Only a few minutes later, she ends up dead at his feet--an apparent suicide from the top of the Tower of the Sun, which is part of San Francisco's Exposition Center.   <br /> <br />From there, the plot sweeps along.  Holmes' writing, like his early lyrics, is witty and engaging.  He keeps you guessing til the end.   <br /> <br />The photographs of San Francisco in the 1940's as well as the CD soundtrack are wonderful multimedia additions to the whole \\"Swing\\" experience.  Great job and very much well-written mystery.   <br /> <br />	2005-05-17

When Hennepin County Sheriff's Deputy Sara Pribek's new husband turns up missing--with his trail cold by at least a day--the Missing Persons expert realizes she has very little time to find him.  Thirty six hours and the usual missing persons case goes cold. <br /> <br />Problem is, she scarcely knows her husband of just two months.  Mike Shiloh is not well liked on the Minneapolis Police Fore where he works.  He doesn't have many friends outside of 'the job' and he's not been in touch with his estranged family in Salt Lake City for many years. <br /> <br />Sara's search for Michael takes her in to a past case and the murder of a fellow detective and friend's daughter.  While the trail isn't precisely straightforward, I suspect that makes it even more real. The book definitely has its twists and surprises and is a compelling read throughout.   <br /> <br />As the Amazon reviewer said, this is a PROCEDURAL, so it is not for the faint-of-heart or for those looking for toss-away lines and amusing chracters.  Sara's work digs into the heart of policework and may well strike some nerves as well.  All in all, this is a very promising start for Compton and I will be reading her sequel as soon as I can get my hands on it.	2005-05-16

Born and raised in Las Vegas, New Mexico, she lived an almost hermitlike existance in an old Victorian house dominated by her Mother Collette, who was served by a host of silent and fearful women.  As a child, she had a private tutor, attended the town's exclusive school, and wore velvets and lace--like her Mother, who dressed more a mirror of the Victorian house they dwelled in.  Passion awakens in Mira when she touches her first crayon and learns to draw.  As a friend later describes, she starts out tentative and frightened and is drawing pictures with vivid colors and contrasting shading within two weeks' time.  <br /> <br />At the age of nine, when Collette disappeared, Mira was moved to foster-care in Ohio.  There, she grew up in public schools, wears clothes from Sears and Roebuck, and has a fairly normal life.   <br /> <br />Mira  doesn't realize til the age of 21 that she's an heiress.  At 51, when her foster parents die, she learns the Victorian House she was raised in was left to her as part of her legacy... <br /> <br />Mira returns to NM to discover her origins and those of the house.  She comes to realize there is far more involved in the story than she originally thought. <br /> <br />Like all of Lindskold's work, \\"Child of a Rainless Year\\" is beautifully written.  I think the book could possibly be shorter.  The setup of Mira's early life is unnecessarily long.  I think the book would be much more engaging if she starts with the Big Shock---Mira realizes after her foster parents' death that her family home in NM is still standing and is part of her estate and her foster-parents, under the direction of the estate trustees, had hidden Mira away and even gone to the lengths of getting her foster parents to relocate and change her name.   <br /> <br />As other reviewers have said, there is enough unresolved issues to write another book.  If you are not particularly fond of getting the answers, you may want to avoid this novel since it is billed as a stand-alone.	2005-05-14

Kudos to Jim Butcher for getting his first hardcover publication in the Harry Dresden series!  Definitely liked the presentation:  cover illustration is great and the overall work is of excellent quality.      To the story:  Chicago's only Wizard PI, Harry Dresdent's latest story opens up with him agreeing to take care of his cop-friend (who could be more) house while she goes away to Hawaii with another man.  Harry wants to stop her.  Something tells him Murphy wants him to stop her....but he doesn't....    Then, he's contacted by Mavra, a vampire he thought he'd killed before.  If he doesn't get her the \\"Word of Kemmler\\" Murphy is going to be disgraced by some seriously incriminating pictures.  Murph comes from a cop family and this would destroy her.       So, the chase for the elusive Word begins.  In the process, Harry discovers that Kemmler is definitely bad juju.  He was a black wizard sho specialized in necromancy--til he died.  Now, his disciples are on the chase for the Word, too, competing with each other, hoping to gain the power the Word will provide.      It's a fast-paced story with some really good messages within, particularly relating to Waldo Butters and courage.      I don't think DEAD BEAT is as well-paced as the other Dresden novels.  There are some spots that actually drag.  Can't decide whether that is the novel length requirement for hardcover or that Jim Butcher is distracted with his new series. I think I could have done without most of a scene with Harry debating with Alterna-Harry, but skimming will get you the drift.    Still, I highly recommend all of Butcher's DRESDEN FILES novels.  They are well-written.  Since Butcher is a martial artist, the action flows nicely.  The characters are folks you care about--interesting, flawed, but worth knowing.  I am grateful most of all that Harry has stayed pretty much Harry.  He's a good guy, who fights to do the right thing and keep the world safe.  HURRAY FOR HARRY AND JIM BUTCHER!!!!	2005-05-11

Remember in the original stories, he was 'away where the fighting was.' His letters home were cheerful. Then, he became ill and was hospitalized in Washington to finally return at Christmas.    Captain March's story is different.  He purposely didn't tell Marmee and the girls all he'd been through because some things didn't need to be said in a marriage.  He felt like a failure coming home when so many of his fellows were still fighting.    His interior dialog as he meets his wife and daughters after such a long absence is quite poignant.  Overall, I believe this story could easily stand next to the original Alcott classics.	2005-03-11

They come to the town only to discover the vampire ruling the area wants Stormy.   <br /> <br />The story could be a little more quickly paced.  There's a lot of relationship angst going on with Maxie and Lou, a retired policeman Maxie conned into joining them.  Writing style makes it hard to tell who's actually narrating at some times.  The characters are likeable, but there are better novels of this genre:  Tanya Huff's Victory Nelson books come to mind.   <br /> <br />Unless you are wanting to make a committment to a long series, don't get involved with the \\"Twilight\\" books.

If he succeeds, she'll tell him who his mother is.... <br /> <br />\\"Hex and the City\\" is another fast-paced dark fantasy story full of quirky characters and places. \\"Hex\\" is the fourth in the Nightside series.  So far, I haven't been disappointed by any of them.  They're so hard to put down, my techie husband who never reads anything but tech manuals and history picked one up when I was in the doctor and has read the whole series.  I had to hide \\"Hex\\" from him til I was done!  <br /> <br />The books are a blend of Raymond Chandler and Glen Cook's supernatural detective novels.  Taylor's a likeable character who despite his hard edges, falls hard for a damsel in distress, and will do about anything to help a kid.    <br /> <br />For the most part, the \\"Nightside\\" stories stand on their own, but I strongly recommend that you read all of them:  \\"Something Good from the Nightside\\", \\"Agents of Light and Darkness\\" and \\"Nightingale's Lament\\".	2005-02-18

Francisco, a homeless man, is told by a friend that there are good pickings in an abandoned church.  Oddly, his friend seems afraid of the place and is hanging back letting Francisco do the work.  Francisco finds something glittering and pulls an iron spike from the ruins. He kills his way through Mexico go get to LA, where the voices he's started hearing tell him he needs to go. He'll be big in LA, they've promised and Francisco believes.     Exorcist John Constantine is dying of lung cancer.  Worse, he's going straight to Hell and this is one death Satan himself is going to be attending personally.  No hope for a cure, no hope for redemption it's \\"go straight to Hell and do not pass go.\\"    LAPD officer Angela picks a serial killer from a crowd and shoots him before he hurts someone else.  This is not the first time she's sensed an apparently innocent man is a perp.  Her fellow officers are giving her a wide berth.  Then, she dreams her twin sister Isabel is dead by suicide and wakes up to learn the dream's come true.      Angela goes to John Constantine for help.  She's certain her sister didn't commit suicide.  Between the two of them, they uncover a plot that Satan's son Mammon has decided to take over the earth and thus shift the \\"Balance\\" that God and Satan have operated under with such care.  The key to this is the blood of a psychic (Isabel or Angela) and the spear that pierced Christ's side---which Francisco is carrying.     I read the book in one sitting and would have been happy for more.  John Shirley keeps the pace going nonstop.  His characters are real, some likeable some scary as well---Hell...    I don't usually like novelizations, but this concept intrigued me and I'm definitely glad I read this book.  It's an excellent read for fans of horror and dark sci fi.      NOTE:  I read the book before I saw the movie.  I think they're both great.  There are very few enhancements to the movie from the book and I think every touch has improved the visual impact of the story.  I like the movie so much I am planning to see it again and will definitely buy the DVD when it comes out.	2005-02-12

I think the limitations of the novel are in direct proportion to those of the script Hand had to base it upon.  The book is a quick read, but an interesting one.  Unlike the film, Hand incorporates a plot twist that takes the reader by surprise at the end.   <br /> <br />\\"Catwoman\\" by Elizabeth Hand is the story of Patience Phillips, possibly the nicest person in the world.  She works for a large cosmetic firm that's just on the edge of releasing \\"Beauline\\" a cosmetic that promises to be the \\"Fountain of Youth.\\"  Patience discovers the product is fatally flawed.  Unfortunately, the Boss discovers her and she's killed by henchmen.  A cat she'd saved from a ledge earlier that day comes to Phillips' rescue and reincarnates her as \\"Catwoman.\\"   <br /> <br />\\"Catwoman\\" swears to stop her former employer from releasing \\"Beauline\\".  The resulting caper definitely tests Patience's resilience and nine lives.  <br /> <br />The book is a worthwhile and short read, probably an airplane or doctor's office book.	2005-02-10

The local males are not comfortable around her. She works in a bar as a cocktail waitress and if you think that's a fun job to have when you're psychic--think again.    <br /> <br />In general, she doesn't  have many friends---only her boss, Sam, her co-workers at the bar, and her philandering little brother Jason stick by her.   <br /> <br />She'd expected a vampire to come in the bar for a long time.  They're legal now with rights.  Vampirism is the result of a virus.  In this world, synthetic blood is available to stave off the cravings.   <br /> <br />But, the entrace of a pale-faced stranger turns her world around.  At last, someone whose mind she cannot read.   <br /> <br />Charlaine Harris creates a heroine most of us can identify and like.  Her writing is fast paced and sticks to the point.

That's the question forensic psychiatrist, Simon Rose, has to ask about Janice Jensen.  The NYPD found Jensen in her apartment.  Her police officer husband had been shot four times in the head.  Her infant son was pinned to his crib by a fillet knife.   <br /> <br />The cop who investigated said she was \\"gone.\\"  <br /> <br />Janice Jensen was also the star of the Drama Club when Simon Rose knew her back when in high school. Dr. Rose unwittingly takes her case and discovers Janice Jensen used to be Janice Davenport, a girl he'd loved and lost.  For ethical reasons, Dr. Rose declines the case, but Janice won't let go of him. <br /> <br />Her Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity Defense is approved.  She spends six months in a mental hospital.  Then she's out and campaigning for Simon's life.   <br /> <br />Art Bahr has created an amazing cast of characters:  Simon, the hippie shrink who's still recovering from his wife's accidental suicide 20 years prior,  Debby, Simon's adopted daughter who has nightmares from a past life, Kate Newhouse, the spunky wheelchair bound criminal attorney,  Tommy, Simon's kid brother who's an unrepentent thug.   <br /> <br />And, Janice--at 45, still as beautiful as she was in High School.  And still as deadly.  <br /> <br />For the most part, the plot keeps you moving, and the explanation of the NGRI defense from an author who is a forensic psychologist is definitely worth a read.    <br /> <br />\\"Criminally Insane\\" is an unusual book in that it was finished posthumously by Art Bahr's wife.  Clearly the first part of the book is mostly Bahr's.  The second part was finished from Bahr's notes.  My ***** rating is based more on the first pages and the wife's labor of love to get the book done.  While the second half clearly is not in the same 'voice' as the first, \\"Criminally Insane\\" is still a worthwhile and enjoyable read.	2005-02-10

Due writes with a grace and lyricism that makes her stories believable and interesting and her characters worth rooting for.      Her heroine, Angela Toussaint, is on the verge of collapse.  She returns from her high-paced job as a Hollywood talent agent to Sacajawea, WA to the \\"Good House\\" where she was raised by her Grandmother.  She's not been back in two years---since her son Corey was killed at a party.      She learns her childhood home is haunted by a Voodoo spirit who was her Grandma Marie Toussaint's patron.  Angela also learns she has her Grandmother's talent to work the magic to heal the situation.  Her Grandma always had faith that she'd make the old curse she activated right, but can Angela learn what to do in time?      I have two complaints about this book which merit the 4 star rating.  First, the ending.  No spoilers here, but I don't like this type of story.  Second, the subtle 'advertising'.  I totally agree with Tananarive Due's character's comments that Steven Barnes (Due's husband) is a great writer.  I was just hoping books were someplace that kind of advertisement would be taboo.  The whole scene felt like it was written for the sole purpose of mentioning Barnes' books.	2005-02-09

She soon discovers that witches, werewolves and vampires are looking for Eric and she doesn't know who to trust.  When her philandering brother, Jacon, goes missing, she's seriously out of allies.   <br /> <br />For the most part, I enjoyed this novel.  I like Sookie.  She's your Everywoman's Hero.  She doesn't carry a lot of firepower, she doesn't have any particular skills in fighting, but she uses her wits and heart to get her out of the scrapes she gets into.  <br /> <br />One bad note is Sookie's love life.  From this book, it looks like Harris is setting us up for another LKH style three-way and frankly I've been there done that and not buying anymore of the Anita Blake series.  Do I personally want Sookie to settle down?  Nope, not really, but I don't want the character of the person I like--the girl who'd risk her own life to save an enemy in need--changed.  Sookie is a one-man kind of woman and I don't think that should change.	2005-02-08

If you're just starting with Shinn's books, pick another.  You may want to read this later because her work is very good, but this is not the best first impression.	2005-02-04

For the most part, the story had enough twists and action to keep me going.      However, this is the last Laurell K. Hamilton book I will read.  She's gone over to the Dark Side and not in a good way.  Her writing has gone from humor to erotica to hard erotica to sick violence.      \\"I don't sleep with vampires,\\" Anita Blake was known to say in her first novels. \\"I kill them.\\"      I could forgive her for sleeping with Jean-Claude.  Hey, the menage a trois was interesting, but it took up too much space when I was reading for the mystery, interplay between good and evil, and action. And, Anita was spending waaay too much time on \\"Why am I doing this?\\" internal dialogues when she wasn't involved with the Richard and Jean Claude.       Then, the books got more violent.  Women were abused, then men.  I've had it with this last book.  Yes, bad things happen to babies, but there is one scene in \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\" that is completely inexcusable. Having lived in Oklahoma City when the bomb blew up the Murrah Building, I found what LKH wrote about the babies in the nursery cruel and completely unnecessary. An author can paint tragedy with a light enough brush that we have an idea of happening without wallowing and being almost obsessive about it.	2005-01-30

It's not even porn, because it 'tries' to be a novel.  Sad, especially sad because bringing this book out in hardcover and paper editions is a huge waste of trees. I don't say that about many books.        I suppose \\"Incubus Dreams\\" is better than the 'talking head' relationship angst we suffered through in \\"Cerulean Sins\\".  At least, something happened, although LKH seems to have forgotten all the plot points she laid out in that previous novel. I'm honestly tired of little else but the wild thing going on in LKH's novels.  That's not what I read fantasy for. I have an erotica collection for when I want strictly bedroom olympics.      As far as Anita sleeping with anything around being 'character development', I don't think so.  Characters have a set of core values that generally don't change.  If you read the first of the Anita Blake novels, Anita didn't approve of indiscriminant sex and she didn't approve of vampire lovers, either.  Certainly Jean Claude could have changed her mind on the latter, but I'm not so sure the former would change. Some of you might have thought her a 'goody two shoes' on both respects, but I long for the days when a tough Anita said,\\"I don't sleep with vampires, I kill them.\\"     I also miss the books being FUNNY.  I don't smile anymore when I read this dreck.       Cynthia Ward (Amazon Reviewer above) gave a pretty good analysis of the content of this novel.  I'm going to add that the angst feels more like filler (is she paid by the word or what) and the sex in a lot of cases is pretty empty and boring. Suspect Laurell is losing interest and doing as much as she can to fill in, thinking the readers will be merely interested in the sex.      Sorry, this reader's lost interest.       Kept reading the Anita Blake novels because I cared about Anita and the characters.  No longer.  I'm even getting rid of the first of the series.  It's a pity.  The original Anita Blake series was witty, compelling and fun.  I think Laurell K. Hamilton got lost somewhere in the writing.	2005-01-30

When he said Rachel Morgan is a cross between Stephanie Plum and Anita Blake.  I'm going to modify that slightly and say she's the best of these two characters.  She's got more common sense than Steph and is still as funny. Unlike Anita Blake, she's not suffering such constant 'relationship angst' that she cannot focus on her work at the time.       \\"The Good, the Bad and the Undead\\" is the follow-up to Kim Harrison's first novel from last year, \\"Dead Witch Walking.\\"  In that volume she introduced an alternate reality where much of the human population was killed off by a genetically engineered military virus carried in tomatoes.  After the Turn, the extra-normals, witches, weres and others, helped the humans recover.  Together, they work to achieve a balance between their individual races so they are not preyed upon too heavily by the vampires.     Our heroine, Rachel Morgan, is a free-lance witch for hire.  She does everything from retrieving stolen mascots (Koi, to be exact) for a baseball team to helping the FIB (the human law enforcement angency) with a serial killer case.      In this sequel to \\"Dead Witch Walking\\", Rachel's teamed up with human FIB agent Glenn to stop a serial killer of ley-line witches.  What she realizes once she's taken the job is that she's putting herself in peril for death, too.      The book's hard to put down, full of engaging characters and very well written for a second novel.  I thoroughly enjoy Harrison's work--it's funny with a geniune voice and a plot.  She's improving with every novel she releases.  Can't wait til June and \\"Every Witch Way but Loose.\\"	2005-01-30

He's bound for a challenge with his best friend and Pack Leader, Micheal.  This would be disastrous. He takes off with a multiple purpose---save the World and save his Pack at the same time.     Sara Gunn is the reincarnation of Morgan Le Fay and she's destined to destroy the world.  She doesn't have an idea of this til some red robed assassins and then Derik try to kill her.      As long as you suspend belief, the story's funny.  However, neither Derik nor Sara would qualify as 'the brains of the outfit.'  Any success they have is due to dumb luck--with the emphasis on the first word.      Still, Davidson's humor kept me laughing.  The book was a light and quick read. This was MUCH more of a romance than a fantasy.  Most of the pages were dedicated to Derik and Sara's romance.  The erotica is monogamous and no one gets hurt, which I definitely approve of.      I'm not sure I will read more of Davidson's books.  I tend to read more for the plot and the fantasy angle and this just wasn't much part of \\"Derik's Bane.\\"	2005-01-28

I enjoy using thesauri and dictionaries to look up words.  For many years, I had several dictionaries and thesauri on my shelf.  Recently, I have found several online sources for dictionaries, but have not been able to replace my Super Thesaurus.   <br /> <br />The book is organized cleanly.  Information is easy to find and read.   <br /> <br />\\"Super Thesaurus\\" would make a great gift for a beginning writer in grade school or a college bound freshmen.  I would highly recommend this book for word lovers of all ages.	2005-01-28

Tinker, a genius level salvage yard owner and inventor is just minding her business when she sees an elf attacked.  Unhesitating, she helps him out.     Next thing she knows, she's dragged to Elfhaim, the part of Philadelphia that is a slice into another world due to a Chinese gate malfunction.  Worse, she discovers she's married to the elf she saved.      Wen Spencer's world of not-so-distant Philadelphia changed by technology and the invasion of elves is both engaging and intriguing.  Spencer weaves a fine tale with Tinker and the assorted cast of human, halfling and elves.  She's definitely an author to read whether in this world or the one she created for Ukiah Oregon in Alien Taste.	2005-01-27

Both his Mom and Dad act strangly as they drive him to their suburban home in Edmond.  They send him out on an errand and while he's in the spice aisle of the supermarket, they commit suicide.   <br /> <br />Seven years later, a certified letter catches up to Ryan in Pensacola, FL.  The day before he flew out to Oklahoma, his Mom had sent him a clipping of a symphony review and a piece of paper with the name \\"Department Thirty\\" and an Oklahoma City phone number.  <br /> <br />Ryan's calling the number starts him on a wild chase to find the true identity of his parents and himself.  For a first novel, the story is well-written.  Characters are interesting and believable.   <br /> <br />I can attest to the fact that Kent's writing does improve with further books.  By accident, I read \\"Black Mesa Conspiracy\\" first and could scarcely put it down.  While \\"Department Thirty\\" is not quite as suspenseful, I also recommend it and look forward to reading more of Kent's work.	2005-01-27

Read and loved John Grisham's first couple of novels, but they quickly got stale for me.  The imitators didn't even make it past the bookstore coffee shop. <br /> <br />Picked up \\"Offer of Proof\\" and barely put it down til I'd finished.  Heilbrun writes both a good plot and character driven novel, which is hard to do for old-timers.  As a debut offering, this novel is a stunner.   <br /> <br />Ten years ago, Harvard-educated Archibald Gold, the first legit member of his family, walked away from a high-salary corporate law firm and his equally high-maintenance corporate attorney wife to become an underpaid public defender.  <br /> <br />Yes, he's gotten guilty people off.  To effect, he says anyone who has a problem with defending guilty people needs to find another profession.   <br /> <br />What drives him to cross over the line is when he's got an innocent defendant in the first death penalty case in New York State in 50 years.   <br /> <br />That's all you need to know.  Heilbrun spins a fine yarn and doesn't drop a stitch in the final picture.  The only question I'm left with at the end of the book is: <br /> <br />WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE COMING OUT????	2005-01-22

Oklahoma--the land that spawned notable authors such as CJ Cherryh, Mel Odom, Mercedes Lackey, strikes again.  David Kent, wearing another hat as KCSC Radio personality, shows promise to join in the illustrious company.   <br /> <br />The story opens with a woman named Maggie giving birth to a child she's signed away for adoption....She regrets this decision, but what can she do?   <br /> <br />Just as her son is born, her husband rushes into the operating room.  The last thing Maggie remembers is a flash of light.   <br /> <br />We move next to Art Dorian, an academic, opening the first case for Department Thirty, a US Government agency chartered to pardon criminals in exchange for secrets, a kind of \\"Witness Protection\\" program for the guilty.  He's signing up Case #1 for the agency, but he has grave doubts about the man he's pardoning.  <br /> <br />Next, Eric Anthony receives word his guardian is dying.  Colleen, a former movie actress, tells him on her deathbed he's not who he thinks he is.  She adds a new name to his:  Miles.  <br /> <br />Then, US Marshal Faith Kelly is forced to join Department Thirty because Dorian confided in her before he died.  What the agency stands for goes against the grain, but she doesn't have any other choice.   <br /> <br />Meanwhile, an assassin is starting a killing spree by bombing a law-enforcement picnic.  He's set the hit up as a terrorist attack.... <br /> <br />Think that's a lot to keep up with?  It just keeps going from there.  Strongly recommend this second book.  I haven't read Department Thirty (the first in the series) yet, but I definitely plan to!  Looking forward to more from David Kent.	2005-01-22

Still, \\"From the Ashes\\" has a lot of appeal for both Rennies and Mundanes (if you have to ask, you probably are one, but the definition is loosely folks who don't participate in Ren Faires, sci-fi cons, etc.) Anyone who's ever attended a RenFaire or been curious about one gets a good look at what goes on behind-the-scenes.  In some ways, too good of a look, though.  Brunner's anecdotes are interesting in relation to character development, but they bog the plot down.      Essentially, the story is about friendship, good and evil, that takes place against the Magickal backdrop of Pendragon Faire.  Ryna, who is a career Rennie and magickally gifted, has been in the Faires for so long they're ordinary to her.  Plus, she's working to overcome a romance-gone-bad with Liam.  Bea, who just started in the Ren Faires, is seeing the event through fresh eyes, but having some 'rookie' problems.  Liam is attracted to Bea, but Bea is feeling more interest for Ryna.  The story between the two is engaging and interesting.     For a first novel, \\"From the Ashes\\" is not bad, just not quite mature and developed.  Brunner does wonderful character; however, the balance between that and plot is uneven because of too many side trips.	2005-01-20

If like me, you've read \\"Running with the Demon\\" and \\"Knight of the Word,\\" you'll want to know what happens to John Ross and Nest Freemark.  Character is what this book is about.   <br /> <br />In this final volume of the trilogy, Nest is 29 and living back in Hopewell, Illinois.  John Ross, once more a Knight of the Word, has come back to try and claim a potentially powerful entity--a newly born Gypsy Moth--for the Word.   <br /> <br />Findo Gask, a demon, wearing an \\"Elmer Gantry\\" like face, has assembled his own odd crew of fighters aiming to take the moth for the Void.  The results of this battle could change the balance substantially.   <br /> <br />While I still love Ross and Freemark, it almost feels like some of this story is templated--particularly the fight scenes.  I'm glad to have read the book.  It's good to know what happened to two characters I value, but this is a lackluster end to what I consider a staller beginning.   <br /> <br />If you're interested in Terry Brooks and want to read this series, start at the beginning with \\"Running with the Demon\\" but understand it 'runs downhill' from there.	2005-01-20

John Ross is a Knight of the Word drawn to Hopewell to combat Evil.  <br /> <br />As the plot unfolds, we discover that the Demon has influenced one of Nest's classmates to harass her and also some irritated steelworkers to set off a bomb at a July 4 picnic.

First, it's the usual contemporary person going to anther world and second, it's way too autobiographical.     Too often, it seems that new fantasy authors take a person from a contemporary land and send them back to another time/place/ dimension.  This 'presentism' allows the character to live in and often subtly critique the less-developed world from their present-day point of view. Of course, present-day Shannon who replaced Rhiannon in the alternate world was a much better person.      Also,  PC Cast is putting way too much of herself in this story.  Let's see, she teaches school.  So does Shannon Parker, her protagonist.  She lives in Oklahoma.  Ditto that for Shannon.  Cast admits in her author notes to borrowing her friends as characters.  She didn't even change their names to protect the innocent.      To offer some balance for the negative, PC Cast writes with an earthy, humorous voice that creates an interesting heroine.  \\"Goddess by Mistake\\" is definitely light reading---on the cotton candy scale for me--but if you're needing that kind of diversion and you're interested in a romance with the elements of fantasy, then \\"Goddess by Mistake\\" might just be the book for you.      As far as classification:  this book is a romance with elements of fantasy.  Fantasy readers may enjoy this as a light reading.	2005-01-18

She's accompanied by Austin, a senior citizen--who coincidentally is feline.  In the first of the book, she's reunited with a former companion, Dean, a Bystander who she parted with when she realized that the life of a Keeper wasn't safe for 'bystanders.' The subsequent good feelings of their reunion creates an angel who is brought to Earth---without a summons to fulfill. <br /> <br />All things having to be equal, Chaos spits out a demon in female form who is Samuel's counterpart.  Add to the complexity, Diana who is Claire's more powerful younger sister, and you have a whole lot of tension going on.   <br /> <br />Huff is not known for her humor, but I think she should be.  Of the three books (Summon the Keeper, Second Summoning and Long Hot Summoning) this book strikes the best balance between humor and plot.   <br /> <br />All in all, the whole series is a keeper.	2005-01-12

Paige Winterbourne is a 23 year old witch who's lost her coven because she's involved with rebel sorcerer and attorney, Lucas Cortez.  When Lucas' father, Benecio Cortez, the head of Cortez Cabal (think of him as the Don of a Sorcerial Mafia) comes to Lucas with a case involving the attack and murder of supernatural teenagers whose parents work for the cabals, the pair initially refuses.      But, as the deaths mount, their conscience compels them to accept.  Paige and Lucas are fighting against time to find the murderer because the girl they foster is an eventual target.     The story takes us through a series of twists and turns that are both unexpected and well-thought-out.  I enjoyed the characterization, the plot, and the writing style.

First, let me say that Diane Duane is one of the top science fiction/fantasy writers today.  This is not her best work. If you want to try her best, check out \\"Book of Night with Moon\\"  or \\"Door Into Fire.\\"   <br /> <br />In this multi-dimensional world, the equivalent to our real world has psychic/magical powers.  One of those is Justice which allows one with that power to speak with the voice of the dead.  It certainly solves crimes.  That, in itself would be an interesting and thrilling novel, but Duane has to add the second dimension, Alfheim, the Elf World.  Elves are getting killed and someone's covering up.  Finally, we add the complication of the Elf King.  It's too much---definitely doesn't realize any of the various storylines' potential. Further, Duane's heroine's self-esteem was just plain sad. Ladies, you'll see what I mean when you read this. At the end, I had the strong urge to yell \\"Get a clue, sister!\\" into the book.   <br /> <br />Still, \\"Stealing the Elf King's Roses\\" is well-written and worth a read if you like the rest of Duane's books.  I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel in this world with a bit more focus.	2005-01-07

Nobody likes him, not even the man who is assigned to be his squire.  He was executed by his family back in Rome and tends to believe anyone he helps is cursed by him. He's reserved--snobbish, for someone who's lived in this world since the Roman Empire.  And still in love with a woman he couldn't have before he died.     Tabitha owns a sex shop named Pandora's Box on Bourbon Street in New Orleans which caters to transvestites.  Though she's not a Dark Hunter by blood, she 'moonlights' kicking daimon [...]. She's part of a large family in more than one sense of the word:  she has seven sisters and she's also part of gay 'family.' Just about everyone knows her on the street and despite her eccentricity, she's well liked.     They met by accident when daimons attacked Tabitha and Valerius tried to save her life---only to get stabbed by Tabitha as an accidental fate.  They're definitely not likely partners, but they have a strong attraction.  When Valerius realizes Tabitha and her twin sister who's married to his enemy, are in danger, he has to help.      The book is witty, interesting.  Kenyon's characters are well-realized and her world is one I would want to visit again.      \\"Seize the Night\\" would have gotten 5 stars from me save for two flaws.  First, the threat to Tablitha and her sister was not apparent until page 127.  True, I was enjoying myself seeing Valerius and Tabitha's relationship unfold, but the novel is billed as a romantic thriller and the thriller part was getting neglected.     Second, Kenyon switches point of view so quickly sometimes it's tough to catch whether it's Tabitha or Valerius thinking. You get used to the switches after a few pages, but the style is distracting if you are not used to it.	2005-01-06

The story's central character is Changer, aka The Trickster or Coyote, who is the oldest of the \\"Athanor\\" an ancient race of legengs, including such a King Arthur, who walk this world today.  Changer has to join forces with Arthur in this tale, which pits his inhuman values with those of the human King against a common problem.   <br /> <br />Lindskold's writing style is graceful and lyrical.  While Changer doesn't on the surface appear to be someone we all have a lot of common ground with, the reader forms a strong bond with him and Lindskold's other characters quickly.  The plot also sweeps you along.   <br /> <br />As I said in the opening sentence, be sure to have plenty of time set aside to read this book.  You will not want to put it down.  I envy that you will be reading \\"Changer\\" for the first time.	2004-12-29

I continued to read it after I found quite a few flaws because I'd invested.  Somwhere, I thought the book would get better. Sunshine isn't a 'can't put it down' book.  Frankly, in my case, it's a 'put it down when it becomes tiresome and pick it up again because it's the only book you have in your bookbag.'      That's not to say the book doesn't have its good points. As always, McKinley's work is beautifully written, but in no way would I consider this work one of her best.  It's a meandering tale full of backstory details (info-dump) that slows the action down to a crawl.  Frankly, several times while I was reading, I put the book down and almost left it---in the doctor's office, at the blood bank, etc.      My main example of this is when the protagonist, Rae, is taken by vampires on page 12.  On page 17, Rae wakes up terrified after five pages of background that come from where???  While I don't want to see this book become a splatterpunk action novel, when there is action and tension, the writer should get on with the story instead of flooding us with backstory and information dump.      While McKinley's prose is beautiful and her characters are well realized, Constantine (the Mushroom Man) was not my idea of a leading guy.  This is definitely a different spin on the bloodsuckers, but I'm not sure this is conducive to the romance angle.  Further, in many ways, the romance angle cheapens the literary nature of the work and panders more to pedestrian tastes.  Of course, we now have Sunshine/Rae involved in a love triangle between a vamp and probably a sorcerer.  Oh where have we seen that storyline before?      Someone mentioned McKinley's preoccupation with food.  Okay, Sunshine is a baker, but this book is guaranteed to send you into hyperglycemia.  Oddly, I didn't experience any food cravings as a result.  The whole narrative was just too over-the-top regarding Sunshine's legendary baked goods, it was like riding on a roller coaster on a hot day with a little too much ice cream on your stomach.  It wasn't enough to make me sick, but I wasn't comfortable, either.      I'm sure there will be a sequel, but McKinley hasn't given me a compelling reason to read any more than this book.	2004-12-20

Tabor's smoky contralto is one of the most beautiful voices in folk music today. Tabor marks every song she covers with her own individual grace and style.  This blend of traditionals and new music is no exception.  Her rendition of Eric Bogle's painfully beautiful \\"No Man's Land\\" is the best of any I've heard. On the opposite side, \\"The Devil and Bailiff McGlynn\\" gives us some light relief.    <br /> <br />If you enjoy traditionals with beautifully arranged and sung by a stunning contralto, this is definitely a must for your collection. This 1977 Topic records release is hard to come by, but worth the trouble.	2004-12-09

While you're at it, make sure the lights in the house are on and you have an emergency phone at your side.   <br /> <br />Yes, THROUGH VIOLET EYES is that much of a page turner.  Dan Atwater is an FBI agent called in to investigate the deaths of Violets, folks born with violet irises who are conduits for the dead.  He's paired with Natalie Lindstrom, a Violet who has already 'been visited' by several friends who have died at the killer's hands.   <br /> <br />Dan's off his game due to accidentally shooting an innocent man.  Natalie's traumatized and bitter.  They make quite a pair, but they get the job done.   <br /> <br />The one point I will take from this novel is the 'real' Bad Guy didn't really get destroyed. Save for a couple of flashes of brightness, this is a pretty grim world.  Not to be read if you're feeling somewhat down in the first place!	2004-12-01

Miniwa, WI cop, Jessie McQuade is a tough pragmatic woman who only believes what she sees.  That is, until a schoolteacher who was bitten by a wolf goes rabid in her schoolroom the next day.   <br /> <br />Miniwa is under seige.

Can Jessie trust the man she's come to love and who appears to be helping her--or, is he part of the plot?    <br /> <br />The ending surprised me--and that doesn't often happen!  <br /> <br />This book is a fast-paced first-person narrative that actually works comfortably.  I like Handeland's 'voice' for Jessie.  What's more---this is not one of those romance novels where the heroine starts strong and loses all sense when she falls in love.  Jessie stays Jessie throughout.  I like that.  I'll be looking for more of Handeland's books!	2004-11-28

Who better, since he knows someone's died before the body's cold?    And, cold is true in this case. Victims are milkmaids, dyers, other young working women of the castle--brutally murdered with their organs savaged.      Of course, the prime suspect is the King's grandson.  Of course, you are on your seat wondering if Dubric can solve the crime before another innocent dies or their countries go to war.

David, the free-djinn who used his magic to rescue her, is sharing his power to keep them both alive.  Joanne's got to learn--and learn quickly--how to live on her own, else both she and David may well die and for good.  Book's decent enough to keep reading, but the first part of it wades through a lot of 'relationship material' between her and David that I could do without.

Three \\"Ukiah Oregon\\" books ago, Wen Spencer was a new novelist with an engaging character and some new novelist faux pas under her belt. I still read \\"Alien Taste\\" in one sitting and went out and got the next two books. \\"Bitter Water\\" is the toughest read of the group, but every one of them is enjoyable and pulls you through the story.      The first thing I will say about Book Four is you don't need the first three books to read and understand it.  But, I believe you will be so engaged by Ukiah Oregon's story that you will WANT them.      In this novel, Ukiah Oregon discovers he has a big brother.  While the feeling of not being the only one is good, neither brother can trust the other.     Strongly recommend you read this book when you have several hours to devote to it.

If you loved the classics like \\"Maltese Falcon\\" and would like your kids to enjoy them as well, Linda Spencer's Sam, the Cat Detective novels are the best way to get them to loving mysteries.  Sam, a grey alley cat with a heart of gold, is a private detective.  Okay, sometimes his logic is fuzzy--he is a cat, after all.  And his 'bank account' has an odor---he takes payment in fish.  But, Sam always gets his man whether it be human or feline--and sometimes his woman, too.   <br /> <br />In this book, Sam is approached by Brighid (Miss Wonderful) to help her find her lost kitten. She's of course, a beautiful liar.  Sam discovers the kitten is a valuable Maltese from a line of cats dating back to the 1500's and the plot just gets thicker from there.   <br /> <br />Even for adults, this is an enjoyable read and a quick one at just 133 pages.  I highly recommend Sam and hope to see another novel by Stewart soon!	2004-11-15

In this quirky coming of age tale, late bloomer Gypsum LaZelle is the last of her brothers and sisters to gain her magical powers. Unfortunately, the power she gains is an 'unkind power' in the family parlance.  She is 'gifted' with the power to curse and apparently is quite strong in this gift.  <br /> <br />It's instructional to see how Gypsum learns to take a negative and turn it into a positive.  She develops teamwork skills by filtering her powers through another sib Flint, who seems to get his magic wrong more often than not and ends up giving them both a self-confidence boost.  In a Jungian twist, she also reconciles herself with her Shadow by working with 'curse child' Altria to find a way to deal with the power she has in a controlled manner.  By trusting the Shadow, she is also trusting herself and the two can form a mutualiztic bond.   <br /> <br />The book is very well done, but it loses its mark as an adult novel and in my opinion may be too high level for a young adult.  Still, I would seek out Hoffman's other work and give it a try.	2004-11-10
