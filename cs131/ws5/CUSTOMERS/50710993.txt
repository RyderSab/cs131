Unfortunately, it's often hampered by poor writing. A couple more passes of the editor's pen would have eliminated a lot of the wordiness and over-constructed sentences. The writing improves midway through the book (or maybe you just get used to it), but it can be a struggle getting through the first few chapters. <br /> <br />Another problem for the book is that the authors neglect to wrap up any of the dozen or so storyline threads. Everything is left in transition, with half the threads ending (for now) halfway through. I can understand that the authors want to do a series, but when everything is set up for payoff later it means that nothing pays off now. It doesn't make for a particularly enjoyable first volume. <br /> <br />That said, there are plenty of moments that capture interest and most of the characters are more than cardboard cut-outs. The good guys have their bad points. The bad guys have layers of nastiness and understandable motivations. Regardless of what you may think of the book's eschatology, this is a vast improvement over the Left Behind series. <br /> <br />The End-Times aspect of the book neither impressed nor discouraged me. This is a work of fiction. Implementation of ideas is more important than factual accuracy. I'm unconvinced the Left Behind series has much accuracy; I don't expect much truth in prophetic interpretation here, either. If you're sensitive to that kind of thing, this may not be the book or series for you. <br /> <br />The novel's not entirely bad, but it's no Ben-Hur, either. I'm going to wait until the series is complete before pursuing it further.	2005-03-31
US	50710993	R13MGINOQVROSH	0736914056	524466620	Forgiving Solomon Long	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Brilliant!	Too often Christian writers settle for being imitative instead of original. Thankfully Chris Well is not the Christian answer to Elmore Leonard or Carl Hiaasen; his voice and style is unique. While fans of Leonard and Hiaasen - and Shakespeare - will enjoy this novel, it will be because it presents a fresh and funny take on the mob scene, instead of the all-too-typical over-moralized Christian fiction knockoff.    Forgiving Solomon Long is the story of a contract killer who develops a conscience late in his career. It's also the story of mobsters who quote everything from Chekhov to The Odd Couple (and, unfortunately, Punky Brewster), pop decongestants like tic-tacs, and try to find their way in a world that has stopped making sense. And then there are the men and women of law enforcement, whose worlds are beginning to fall apart as well. All of it told in a fast-paced, funny style that will keep you laughing as the chapters whiz by.    My only problem with the book comes at the ending. In an effort to keep things fast-paced, description and imagery are sacrificed, characters are forgotten (although that seems somewhat intentional based on a literary observation by one of the gangsters), pop culture references all but disappear, and the story gets stretched a bit thin. It's not enough to detract from the brilliance of the first three-quarters of the book, but still - bada-bing - there it is.    If you're looking for a book with engaging characters and an entertaining plotline, that deals with issues of faith without preaching, and tackles Shakespearean tragedies (e.g., Macbeth, King Lear, Julius Caesar) without being overly blatant, pick up a copy of Chris Well's  breakout first novel. You might not forgive yourself if you don't.	2005-02-11

Jacobs' autobiographical romp through the Encyclopaedia Britannica is light-hearted, fact-paced, and trivia-strewn.  <br /> <br />There are two parts to \\"The Know-It-All\\": the individual encyclopaedia entries and Jacobs' running commentary on his life,  how facing his quest changes him, and all the places he's gone with an encyclopaedia in tow. It's like a travelogue through the Britannica. You find out about everything from cross-eyed fetishes to a wide range of ancient and modern philosophies, and at the same time Jacobs deals with father/son issues - both between himself and his father and himself and his will-he-ever-be-conceived child - and in-law sibling rivalry. Jacobs' sense of humor isn't going to get him a sitcom deal any time soon, but his wry observations about history are amusing if not always side-splitting. <br /> <br />Is it a problem that the author is an extremely privileged individual? To a degree, yes. It becomes tedious after awhile, reading about all the fun things he gets to do based on a seemingly endless supply of cash - one scene of him and his wife sweating an American Express bill would have been appreciated. At the same time, if I had the opportunity to do the things he did, I probably would. Would I like to jaunt across the Atlantic for a wedding or cross-country to keep my wife company? Sure. Like to meet Alex Trebek? What is \\"yes\\"? Drop several thousand dollars on a set of reference books? You betcha. If I'd like to do those things, I can hardly begrudge Jacobs the opportunity himself.  <br /> <br />Jacobs comes to the conclusion that knowledge and wisdom are not the same thing, but that knowledge is worth having if it gives broader insight into the questions of life and allows for wiser decision making. It reminds me of an old stand-up bit I heard as a kid: Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy a Cadillac so you can drive around looking for it. Knowledge and money are tools to gain the prizes of wisdom and happiness. Maybe you wind up an educated fool who is soon parted from his money, maybe not. But you'll never know unless you begin the journey.  <br /> <br />Reading this book won't necessarily make you smarter, but it should make you laugh out loud at times. Maybe you get wiser, maybe you don't; but for relatively little money you'll find yourself with some happy moments - and a book to drop on spiders - and that ain't too bad.	2005-01-19

Set in rural Holcomb County, North Carolina, where Nick Polchak expects to keep himself out of trouble, the novel sets up nothing but for our hero and his client, Kathryn Guilford. With an ever-increasing body count and bugs swarming everywhere, Polchak and Guilford must find a way to expose a killer before they wind up as just so much Shoofly Pie, themselves. <br /> <br />The pacing of the novel is fast and the dialogue is frequently funny yet still believable. The scientific elements are presented convincingly without weighing down the story with technical details - how accurate they are, I don't know, but it all sounds pretty plausible when you're reading along. Downs runs into some trouble keeping his POVs fixed; when telling things from Kathryn's perspective, for instance, he will often use technical insect names or forensic jargon she herself wouldn't know. Sometimes he'll include a description of something down a hallway that the POV character couldn't see. Minor points, but they keep the book from getting a five-star rating. <br /> <br />Very little Christianity gets presented in the book; it's limited primarily to the presence of an elderly preacher who conducts a couple funerals. He's treated sympathetically (an exception from the way a secular book would likely portray him), but he never preaches a sermon of Christ-oriented salvation (an exception from most evangelical novels). The net result is a message that Christians are okay folks, no need to run and hide when they come around. There's little in the book to offend - no sex, no swearing and \\"on-screen\\" violence is limited to a couple fistfights - but Downs doesn't go to the Pollyanna extreme, either. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of any of the CSI programs on television, you'll likely enjoy Shoofly Pie. A few scenes carry descriptions as gooshy as the graphic CSI animations, so if those creep you out - or if you're insectophobic - you might want to give this novela pass. Otherwise, get ready for an experience unlike anything you've had before. Shoofly Pie is well-worth reading.	2005-01-11

If you're familiar with the I Spy series, you know what to expect in this book. If you're new to the world of I Spy, imagine staring in your fully stocked refrigerator looking for the Philly cream cheese. You know it's there - you just bought it yesterday - but for the life of you, you can't find it. Then your spouse comes by, reaches around you and grabs the tub from beside the two-liter bottle of Pepsi. I Spy is just like that: you know what you're looking for, you know it's in the picture somewhere, and some clown is bound to come by and find it immediately after you've been searching for a half an hour. That's why I recommend letting your spouse have first crack at the pictures. It makes your finding the specified objects a breeze. <br /> <br />The thirteen hide-and-seek pictures in the book all have - as you might suspect from the title - a Christmas theme. There's Santa's workshop, assorted sugar cookies and Christmas tree ornaments, shop window displays, and an arrangement of dolls and stuffed animals that looks a lot like something from the movie, E.T. Most images are set as cheerful tableaus, but several are avant garde arrangements of knickknacks, doodads, and Christmas goodies. <br /> <br />The riddles are challenging, not because they're cryptic but because they have you searching all over the page to find what you're looking for. I find it helpful to work on two or three elements from the riddle at a time. If you're looking for an ice cube, a twist of lime and a carrot-nose all at the same time you're bound to run into one of the three sooner or later. Plus it cuts down on the frustrating \\"ooh, I just saw that ... where'd it go?\\" moments. Once you've exhausted the riddles - and that should take a while - it's good to find a friend and play \\"I spy with my little eye something that begins with....\\" The pages are jam-packed with everything from angels to zebras, so you'll never run out of things to spy. <br /> <br />There are only a couple drawbacks to thebook. First, the glare from the glossy paper can make it difficult to find anything on the page if the lighting isn't right. Second, there's no answer key. It's left to your own judgment as to whether you've found what you're looking for. There are times when you'll be looking for an object, say a jingle bell on the \\"Holly & Ivy\\" page, and you'll see something that looks less unlike a jingle bell than anything else on the page, but you're left wondering if you've actually found it or not. Granted, there are those who'd start with the answer page and fake their spying prowess, but for honorable souls there's no option to solemnly swear you've tried your best and then sneak a peek at the answers. Oh well, I guess it's time to let my wife have a look. <br /> <br />The pictures in the I Spy books are as incredible to look at as they are to search for the hidden-in-plain-sight objects. I Spy Christmas is an excellent choice to add to your collection or to start one with. Enjoy!	2004-12-24

I understand that the Fourth Edition takes steps for greater gender equity in its examples, in addition to making other minor tweaks to the 1979 edition. I don't think you can go wrong with either.<br /><br />The first dozen or so pages tackle the thorniest grammar problems (possessives, subject/verb agreement, pronouns, etc.) and the remainder of the book focuses on how to make your writing clearer and more accessible by the reader. It's here we get the indispensable advice of \\"Omit needless words\\" and \\"Place emphatic words of a sentence at the end.\\" Tips like these turn poorly constructed writing into literary gold - just look what it did for my review title: pure gold.<br /><br />There is also a subtle wry sense of humor running through the book. In section 4 (Words & Expressions Commonly Misused), Strunk & White make this observation regarding nauseous/nauseated: \\"The first means `sickening to contemplate'; the second means `sick at the stomach.' Do not, therefore, say `I feel nauseous,' unless you are sure you have that effect on others.\\" From the section 5.17: Do not inject opinion, \\"To air one's views gratuitously, however, is to imply that the demand for them is brisk, which may not be the case....\\" Granted, Strunk & White are no Martin & Lewis, but this little text is far from dull and dry.<br /><br />There are other style manuals available in print and online, but at about 100 pages (the Third Edition was a mere 85), Strunk & White's Elements of Style will likely deliver the advice you need before you've thumbed halfway through the index of the others.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it. Live it. You'll be glad you did.	2004-12-21

No Problem!: A Low-Stress, High-Velocity Guide to Writing a Novel in 30 Days	Books	5	12	13	N	N	Great Advice for Competition Participants	If you are participating in the annual November National Novel Writing Month event, this book is an indispensable guide for writing well - or at least \\"a lot\\" - in such a short period of time. <br /> <br />My first-ever novel-length first draft may not be Pulitzer quality, but no one's ever is. That's one of the things the book makes clear. Don't strive for quality from the word go, but get the quantity down so you have something to work with in the rewrite. <br /> <br />The tone of the book is conversational and light. Advice from former participants is sprinkled liberally throughout the book. In addition to general advice on how to prepare and what to do and not do while writing, four chapters are specifically geared to the challenges writers face during each week of the month. The most difficult thing I faced during the month was struggling with wanting to read the book straight through.  <br /> <br />Baty performs two invaluable services for writers in the course of the book. He takes their inner editors off their hands for thirty days, and he gives participants the one thing they need to focus their attention laser-like on the task at hand: a deadline. Going into the month I had no idea how significant those two things would turn out to be. It was great to be free of self-criticism and -doubt and to have the deadline looming, becoming more ominous with every passing day. <br /> <br />The only drawback to the first edition is the gray tinted screens behind the sidebar items. They make the sidebars very hard to read. Word has it this will be corrected in the second edition of the book, so you might want to check edition numbers or printing dates before buying. <br /> <br />While the book suggests that you can write a novel in a month any month of the year, I'd recommend waiting until November. I found the support of dozens of like-minded lunatics a great help in making my novel-writing dreams a reality. With the combination of support like that and this book I was able to generate well over the 50,000 word target in thirty days. If you have ever dreamed of writing a novel, this book will make its first draft a distinct possibility.	2004-12-03
US	50710993	R3VK75H0J3DE2X	1400060923	730676187	lost boy lost girl: A Novel (Straub, Peter)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Everything Black House Wasn't	Peter Straub's lost boy lost girl is an incredibly atmospheric book, harkening back to some of Straub's most effective work. The haunting pall that hangs over the Underhill family, the claustrophobia of the Kalendar house, even the \\"terror\\" of the downtown movie set, draw you into Straub's world. Even when parts don't fit together as well as they should, you're still left with the feeling that you've spent time somewhere special. <br /> <br />That said, there are some parts of the book that don't quite match up as seamlessly as the walls inside Kalendar's slaughterhouse. First, Tim-Underhill-as-first-person-narrator intrudes occasionally into third-person-narrative scenes. Super-sleuth Tom Pasmore presence is wasted; granted he gets a ton of extraneous background information on the killer from his computer research, but a simple public records search - that even marginally-competent police detectives ought to have done - is ultimately all it takes to do the trick. It also felt to me that any real jeopardy disappeared three-quarters of the way through the story (the menace of Lily disappears about halfway through; that of the new \\"Kalendar\\" a bit later). While it lasts, the suspense is effective, but it fizzled too soon for me.  <br /> <br />This is Straub's first novel since his collaboration with Stephen King, Black House. Where very little worked for me in that novel, most things worked for me here. The narrative (mostly) worked. The \\"hauntedness\\" of the haunted house was effective, much more than the titular building of the other book. The interweaving of past and present (although there were some plot holes and credibility gaps here and there), if nothing else kept me on my toes - but it still worked more than it didn't. <br /> <br />I applaud Straub for what he tried to do here, marrying Ghost Story with Mystery. This time it didn't work out perfectly. Without any sarcasm I say, \\"better luck next time.\\" If you want to get the nasty taste of Black House out of your mouth, this book will do the trick; it'll even make you think of fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies in the process.	2004-11-01

Jance's Seattle-based mysteries, you probably know how this one ends. Still, getting there is half the fun, and unless you've compiled a thorough dossier on Anne Corley, there are likely to be details you'll enjoy rediscovering.<br /><br />Wrapped around the tragic murder of a young girl, we meet series regulars homicide detective J.P. \\"Beau\\" Beaumont, his partner Ron Peters, Sgt. \\"Watty\\" Watkins, Capt. Powell, attorney extraordinaire Ralph Ames, and perpetual thorn on Beaumont's side, newspaperman Maxwell Cole. Ultimately, though, the murder investigation takes a back seat to Beaumont's love life soon after Anne Corley comes on the scene.<br /><br />I found the Corley storyline problematic. If this is your first encounter with J.P. Beaumont, it seems to me that he's going to come off extremely shallow. Having encountered him before, I knew him to have more substance than demonstrated here, but the clich&eacute;s were a bit painful at times (especially painful is Beaumont's narrative foreshadowing along the lines of \\"...if only I had known\\").<br /><br />Despite some angsty moments and more than a few adult situations, Until Proven Guilty remains a good read. Jance does return to the murdered child mystery in the end, and the stage is set for future Seattle-based adventures. Beaumont, while not at his strongest at the end of the story, does grow and improve as the series continues. If you read this story and enjoy it, you'll like the rest of the series even more; if this book doesn't do it for you, give the next few books a chance - things do get better.	2004-10-24

Sayers' book, The Mind of the Maker, between a fantastic discussion on creative writing (detective fiction, primarily) the author addresses two of the biggest sociological questions: \\"Who am I?\\" and \\"Why am I here?\\" <br /> <br />The answer to the first question is simply: a human created in God's image. The answer to the second question is a bit more complex, as Sayers first explores what God's image is, particularly the triune nature of the Christian deity. By comparing The Creator to an artist (primarily a creative writer, Sayers' forte), Sayers shows the purpose of life to be that of a creator as well. <br /> <br />While Sayers' analogy works best for those with an already artistic temperament, in her final chapters she addresses the question of what happens if you work on a toilet assembly line or some equally unglamorous profession. In the case of the toilet assembler, Sayers suggests that while he or she may simply be turning a screw, what's really being created is a more sanitary and hygienic world. She observes that individuals need to separate the value of money from the value of the work (why both capitalism and communism are, she says, ultimately dehumanizing) and find a higher purpose in one's occupation instead. <br /> <br />While rethinking one's purpose may be the over-all goal of the book, it certainly isn't the only subject addressed. The origin of evil, the difference between human and universal laws, free will, and some of the ancient creeds come up for discussion. If you've been confused by the topic of the Trinity, Sayers provides one of the best analogies I've ever read. If you've been stymied by skeptics accusing the church of casting God in man's image (instead of the other way 'round), Sayers' response alone is worth the purchase price of the book. <br /> <br />This is the first of Dorothy Sayers' theological books I've read. I've been a fan of her Lord Peter Wimsey detective novels, and read about this book in one of her biographies. I began reading the book expecting a treatise on creative writing, but was pleased to find so much more.	2004-10-18

It has basically the same plot as the old Disney flick, Escape from Witch Mountain, but the kids have wings instead of telekinetic powers. Or the Stephen King book, Firestarter, where the kid has pyrokinesis. Or ... well, suffice it to say that the plot's been done before. [probe] Unfortunately for this book it's also been done better. Much better.    Part of the problem is that Patterson has made Max, the winged child most prominently featured in the book, perfect. She's lovely, well-mannered, courageous ... and she can fly. Examples of the dark side of the eugenics program are few and far between. While we're given as scene early-on of an \\"enhanced\\" child surreptitiously taken from his mother, we don't see any Dr. Mengele evil until the final third of the book. Although the reader certainly sympathizes with Max because people are trying to kill her, at the same time it's easy to feel that her ability to fly is adequate compensation for her inconvenience (we should all have such problems). If Patterson had had the lab making half-leech, half-child mutations it would be a completely different story - a better story, too, in my opinion.    Another problem has to do with the two non-mutated protagonists, FBI man Kit and lady veterinarian Frannie. Other than being our eyes and ears into Max's world, they serve no purpose except to eventually get romantically involved. Kit can shoot and Frannie can patch things up, but that's about all they do, and they don't do it often enough to keep things interesting. They're given a bit of backstory, but they don't have to work too hard at overcoming their personal traumas. On the plus side, Patterson should be given some credit for creating a strong female lead (whether it's an accurate portrayal of a woman who has lost her husband and is trying to come to grips with a changing is another question, but I'm all for strong femaleleads - although Kit was a bit more \\"domesticated\\" than I'd have liked).    The story is told primarily from Frannie's point of view, but it frequently switches to third-person when we see things from Max's or Kit's or a few other characters' perspectives. Sadly, everyone's \\"voice\\" sounds the same. Case in point: Max refers to several of the experiment children being \\"put to sleep;\\" it makes sense that the lab would use a gentle euphemism like that instead of saying they were killed or euthanized. Now in Frannie's chapters, she uses it too; again, it makes sense because that's what vets are called to do to beloved family pets from time to time. What doesn't make sense it that it creeps into Kit's chapters: an FBI agent may kill, terminate, blow away, off, slay, or riddle with bullets, but unless it's his child at bedtime he never puts anyone to sleep.     For the most part, though, there's not a lot here to really get bent out of shape over. It's a lightweight story that keeps your interest while you're reading it, but falls apart if you think about it too much. The final chapter of the epilogue was a disappointment, but I guess it makes way for the sequel. If you fear your literacy skills will atrophy while you wait for the next Alex Cross or Women's Murder Club book, go ahead and give this a read, otherwise you're not missing much by giving it a pass.	2004-10-04
US	50710993	R3B35JT0ZKAJG6	0606161686	817560540	The Fly on the Wall	Books	3	7	10	N	N	Anachronistic	Tony Hillerman's The Fly on the Wall has not aged particularly well. Written in 1971, early in his career, the book has been bypassed by technological advances as well as Hillerman's success with the Leaphorn/Chee series. Knowing that no future tales of John Cotton, newspaperman, have been written made getting into the book a little more difficult than I expected. <br /> <br />The characters and setting don't fit well with what one has come to think of as a \\"Tony Hillerman\\" book - that combination of Native Americans, their folklore, and the Southwest. To a man (and a woman), the characters are all extremely liberal in their political viewpoint. If you're convinced there's a liberal bias in the mainstream press, this novel will do nothing to disabuse you of that notion. Even if you do subscribe to the dominant point of view, you may be disappointed by some of the things liberalism's used to excuse in the final chapter. Perhaps the book's greatest weakness is the lack of alternate viewpoints explored: there are no real Republican characters either as foils or villains and this makes for some uninspired conflict and ultimately an unsatisfying resolution. <br /> <br />Part way through the book I found myself wishing Cotton would get himself out of a jam by making a cellphone call, or fax or e-mail his stories in to his editor, then I remembered - 1971! None of those things existed. Teletype machines and direct-dial long distance were the high tech of the day; even though photocopiers existed, Cotton still uses carbon paper throughout the story to make duplicates of his stories written on a manual typewriter. If you're nostalgic for these things, then you'll probably get more out of the story than I did. <br /> <br />The Southwest makes a brief appearance in the middle of the book when Cotton tries to find sanctuary there. While not quite as picturesque as in the Leaphorn/Chee books, this brief respite in  New Mexico marks the point where the novel really picks up steam. Here and in Cotton's escape from the vacant Capitol building near the end of the novel are the two parts where Hillerman's pacing and plotting really shine. Compared to these fast-paced action scenes, the talky final chapter and the lengthy set-up in the first half of the book are big disappointments. <br /> <br />The Fly on the Wall isn't a terrible book, but it's clearly not Hillerman's best. If you're caught up on the latest Navajo novels, go ahead and tackle this one, but there's really no reason to go out of your way for it.	2004-09-25

The pictures are taken from other books in the series, and while the riddles are new, they aren't any more difficult or involved than usual. Think of this as \\"ultimate\\" in the sense of \\"last in a series\\" (until the next one comes out), not \\"highest in degree or order, utmost or extreme\\" (definitions via WordNet). <br /> <br />In addition to this book, I also have the Spooky Night, Christmas, and Mystery I Spy books. Of the 12 pictures in this collection five come from those books (two each from Spooky Night and Christmas, one from Mystery). Also with only 12 pictures, \\"Ultimate Challenger\\" has one fewer picture than the Christmas and Mystery books. And because the pictures come from a variety of sources, there isn't even a \\"find the common element\\" usually present at the end of an I Spy book. <br /> <br />To be sure the pictures are creatively staged and the riddles occasionally make good use of word play (trunk: is that elephant, tree or luggage?), and there are the usual bonus riddles at the end of the book. Make sure you have a very good light source over your shoulder or head because the finish on the pages and lighting of some of the pictures can make the objects even harder to find. <br /> <br />If you're new to I Spy or don't have any of the books recycled here (check the Amazon Search Table of Contents for a list of the pictures, the Back Cover has, I believe, a list of the books involved), the \\"Ultimate Challenger\\" isn't bad - and it's more disappointing than terrible if you do have some of the books already. Just don't expect anything too incredible (either in terms of quality or quantity), or you'll be let down.	2004-09-16

Not only is the pacing and style different, but also his male characters have fully embraced their feminine sides to the point of being almost wimpy (even a minor character, a massive weightlifter, can freely admit to his fear of surgery). Perhaps this is to enhance his female protagonist's machoness, perhaps it's a slam at sunny California from the security of his snowbound Minnesota; either way it's a noticeable departure from his stubborn, tough-as-nails, manly-men characters. <br /> <br />Sandford has structured The Night Crew like a standard mystery, where the reader doesn't discover the identity of the killer until the heroine does. This means a lot of dead ends, as every last red herring has to be tracked down before the case cracks wide open. This too is a departure from Sandford's standard fare. <br /> <br />As with any \\"introductory novel,\\" Anna Batory's story is packed with background information about its characters. Combined with the brief story segments, accommodating all the backstory makes for some very choppy, occasionally disoriented reading. I'm sure some of this is intentional, but at times it all became a little overwhelming. Combined with a lackluster serial killer (there's really nothing to him beyond general creepiness and a generic FBI profile) and several noticeable plot holes (How is Anna's neighbor able to check up on Creek who's registered in the hospital under an alias? Why aren't suspects immediately written off when they lack the requisite facial damage?), and The Night Crew becomes a run-of-the-mill story, rather than a masterpiece. <br /> <br />For all its shortcomings, though, The Night Crew is still an enjoyable read. Television is full of shows that didn't gel right away or took awhile to find an audience. Should Sandford choose to send Anna, Creek and company off on another investigation I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up.	2004-09-10

Sayers provides her detective with quite the conundrum: a known missing body as well as a found unknown one. While the modern reader won't likely be puzzled by whodunit for long, the story is still an enjoyable read. While the class distinctions seem anachronistic - at least in 21st Century America -  I can see that the story could have easily been a sensation for the time and place it was written.  <br /> <br />In addition to introducing Lord Peter, we also meet his mother, the Dowager Duchess, and his brother, Gerald, the Duke (sadly, his sister, Lady Mary and nephew, Gherkins, don't make an appearance in this book), as well as his future brother-in-law,  Parker, the Honorable Freddy Arbuthnot, and, of course, the indispensable manservant, Mervyn Bunter. While all of the characters have some growing to do as the novels progress, Lord Peter's relationship with Bunter is firmly established here. There's little wonder Sayers' series became a hit and has continued to be enjoyed down the years. <br /> <br />While the \\"mystery\\" portion of the book isn't the most challenging, Sayers includes a few entertaining tangents, like the one about the future of mankind's vestigial conscience (which includes an aside about \\"backwards individuals\\" like myself who can wiggle their ears). I enjoyed her philosophical/theological musings here (and moreso in her non-Wimsey mystery, Documents in the Case), and wish she had included more of them in her later novels. <br /> <br />If you've never read any of the Wimsey novels, this is a great place to start. The villain is well-constructed, if insufficiently hidden, and the story has a charm that, while old-fashioned, is charming nonetheless.	2004-09-10

I was tempted to myself, but upon reflection I saw that while it's not perfect, it presents several advantages to going it alone.    While it's certainly possible to produce a formulaic, cookie-cutter book by following Marshall's guidelines, it's not inevitable. On the other hand, if you're too anal in your efforts of following \\"the plan,\\" odds are you'd have been too anal to produce a saleable manuscript without it, as well. While it may not result in providing you with a break-out novel, the plan isn't intended to provide that result. Better to break in first, then you'll have somewhere to break out of.    As with most things, the principles behind the plan are its soundest points. I think there's room for some leeway in the execution of Marshall's points. Your decision may be different from mine, but I'm inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt before I begin flailing around in the dark without a guide.    At first glance, though, parts of the plan seem to make no sense. For instance, in sections told from the (for lack of a more nuanced word) villain's p.o.v., Marshall says the villain never experiences failure. This doesn't mean, however, that the villain can never face a setback, but whatever setback he or she faces is resolved and turned back against the hero before the section is concluded. Likewise, I think it's fair that the hero can stymie the villain in a hero section (or the confidant/love interest in their sections), but he/she/they/it needs to recognize the inevitable repercussions for what has been done (publicly insulting Snidely Whiplash may make your hero(ine) feel good at the moment, but upon further reflection (s)he ought to have doubts about the wisdom of those words/actions).    The only thing that has left me scratching my head is that Marshall has would-be writers determining the word count of completed manuscripts by a mathematical formula basedon page count, rather than as determined by word processing software. If you use an old Underwood typewriter, I suppose his way makes sense, but it seems defining a broader word count target for a genre novel would be more appropriate than eliminating \\"a half page of space\\" at a time by combining two chapters into one. Maybe this will make better sense to me when my manuscript is done and I actually have a word count in hand (\\"No!\\" my self-doubt screams, \\"You've found the ultimate flaw in the plan! Don't attempt to follow it! Never begin work on your novel! Use more exclamation points!!!\\").    Ultimately, the plan boils down to this: know your characters ahead of time; map out your plot before you begin to write, basing each section on what your character(s) did in the preceding section(s); remember to take your characters' emotional states into consideration as you develop your story and reflect it in your writing; put three big escalating \\"surprises\\" in the story and drop them in at the appropriate places within the novel; keep your prose tight and your points-of-view focused. Do you have to wait until your second draft is complete before breaking the book into chapters? I don't know, but the basics of the plan are sound whether you choose to follow them to the letter or not.	2004-09-05
US	50710993	R3TJNHN9NKP511	0380765489	427654724	Shoot/Don't Shoot (Joanna Brady Mysteries, Book 3)	Books	4	7	8	N	N	It Went Ahead and Made My Day	As Joanna Brady makes the shift from Candidate to Sheriff, Jance takes us on a quick-and-dirty primer of police procedure. Attending the Arizona Police Officers Academy (APOA) so she can hold her own with her more-experienced law enforcement staff, Brady finds herself struggling to keep up with classwork, coping with changes in her familial network (the recent loss of her husband, among other things), dodging Cupid's arrows, and trying to keep an innocent man from throwing his life away. And then a homicidal maniac starts stalking her. <br /> <br />Shoot/Don't Shoot has a very convoluted structure, with Jance keeping half a dozen plot lines running at any given time. At times the book was a bit angsty for my taste, and the final few chapters seemed plot-driven, rather than developing as a result/consequence of choices the characters made. It diminishes the quality of the book slightly, but with so much taking place in the novel she can't dwell on any one thing for long. <br /> <br />The \\"mysteries\\" in the book aren't that complex. Granted you don't know the name of the serial killer until the end, but you can make some pretty accurate ballpark guesses about his identity. There are also some odd details about the APOA facility that seemed fairly obvious; Jance does a fairly good job using them to enhance the suspense, though. Other details, however, are hidden so obviously in plain sight that I found myself getting irritated that Brady wasn't paying any attention to them. <br /> <br />If you haven't read any of Jance's Sheriff Joanna Brady mysteries, this would be an okay place to start. It brings you up to speed fairly well with the events of the first two books in the series, without straying far from its own storyline in the process. On the other hand, if you don't deal well with blatant melodrama, you might want to get to know Joanna under less stressed circumstances so you're already invested in her character before reading this at-times-frustrating book.	2004-08-30

Instead of tackling the mistreatment of the Everglades or other gem of the Floridian ecosystem, the author looks at another diminishing national treasure: the daily newspaper. While this subject is certainly near and dear to his heart (and it's likely most people who invest their leisure time reading will concur), it's just not as much fun as what he's done in the past. For one thing, Hiaasen is unable to develop the kind of bizarre characters that are the hallmark of his writing - death-obsessed obituarists, editors who can't write, profit-grabbing publishers can't hold a match to roadkill-eating ex-governors. For another thing it places too many constraints on his hero - while Jack Taggart doesn't completely follow journalistic ethics (not an oxymoron for Hiaasen), his hands are tied several times in how far-out he can get in breaking his story. Hiaasen also falters a few times in staging the story: The fight scene involving a freezer-preserved monitor lizard, for instance, should have been a highlignt of the book; instead it takes place in the dark, robbing it of a lot of its potential zing. <br /> <br />For all that though, the story is still well constructed, the characters engaging and the writing fresh and witty. The main story line, dealing with an investigation into the death of ex-rocker James \\"Jimmy Stoma\\" Stomarti, is handled well. The subplots dealing with Taggart's love interest and screwing over his publisher are presented less believably - they're enjoyable, but riddled with implausibilities and plot holes. Taggart is a likeable guy; I found his Rainman-like ability to tell you who died at a given age amusing. He's determined and resourceful - and apparently one heck of a lover. His fellow crusaders for justice, Emma (his editor) and Janet (sister of the deceased) have their quirks, but do a good job helping Taggart at crucial moments. The villains are abit subdued for a Hiaasen book, likely due to the story's sole first-person POV - because they behave themselves in front of Taggart, we can't fully appreciate them for the wackos they undoubtedly are. <br /> <br />If your friends have been pushing you to read Hiaasen, this book may not give a proper representation of \\"his kind\\" of story. On the other hand, if you're just looking for an enjoyable mystery to take you from one airport to the next, Basket Case will do that, and do it well.	2004-08-26
US	50710993	RI6KQYKTBYPF0	0061000019	88356861	The Blessing Way (Joe Leaphorn Novels)	Books	4	18	20	N	N	"With Beauty It Is Finished"	If you do an advanced search on Amazon for \\"mysteries published in 1970\\" you'll first find a lot of Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew books, and some by old reliables Mickey Spillane, Ross MacDonald, and John Dickson Carr. Then there's the newcomer, Tony Hillerman with his first anthropological (or is it \\"anthropomystical\\" ?) mystery and hero Joe Leaphorn.  <br /> <br />While the cultural/spiritual side of things is never far from the goings-on in a Hillerman story, they overshadow the crime/thriller element in this novel. That's not necessarily a bad thing; the mystery in this case is very slight and makes use of some convenient scapegoating at the end (not unlike secondary character Bergen McKee's theory on Navajo Wolves). The book gives us only the briefest character sketch of Leaphorn (he's absent from a lot of it), and we don't find out much about his wife or co-workers (half the fun - and sadness - of the later books). The transformation of McKee from milquetoasty professor to wilderness he-man is overdone and/or underexplained; fortunately it's a problem Hillerman avoids in the future. Even if things end up a bit too nicely, you've still been entertained for a few hours and learned a thing or two in the process - and bringing things into a harmony is a big part of the story, after all.  <br /> <br />Hillerman is a remarkable author. He is able to tell his story in a way that keeps readers engaged while imparting pages of folklore that in lesser hands would put an audience to sleep. Then consider that he's been able to carve out a niche without much competition for thirty-plus years. That means either a) people aren't really interested in this kind of story (not true, or he wouldn't be writing them for three decades), or b) it's a very hard kind of story to write (persuading other authors to stay away and write things with helicopter explosions). <br /> <br />If you're a fan of the Leaphorn series or are looking to make his acquaintance, give this book a read. It's not his best, but it's better than a lot of other things published in 1970 (Three Days of the Condor, excepted, of course - as is Shaft).	2004-08-21

This novel purports to tell the story of 5 characters who have experienced similar childhoods and have to go back and confront their pasts and The House to which they're all bound. Unfortunately, the book tells the same story five times; details may be different, but the conclusions are the same (sort of a reverse Rashomon). Several times I found myself thinking \\"didn't I already read that?\\" and after going back a few chapters discovering the same sentence or paragraph with only minor changes. Once the characters meet up in the middle of the book things pick up a bit, as Little continues a single storyline from the different perspective of each character, but before long we're slogging through multiple retellings of similar stories again. The fact you have to endure the same pedophiliac sequences again and again (and again and again and again) for each of the five characters takes it from the repulsive effect Little was (hopefully) going for, to repugnant (and being disgusted with Little instead of his characters), to finally just eeeewwww  and wanting to be able to take your brain out and wash off the muck.   <br /> <br />And let's talk about the hypersexed eleven-year-old, shall we? We're told time and again (and again ... well you get the idea) that she wanted the characters to do unnatural things with and to her. Pardon me for being brought up right, but there are NO natural sex acts where an eleven-year-old is concerned. The fact that Little seems to think there are makes me have serious doubts that I'll ever read anything else he's written, even the books other reviewers have recommended instead of this one.  <br /> <br />Rant over. I feel better now. <br /> <br />Whether you read or have read other books by Little, do yourself a favor and skip this one. It's essentially a 100-150 page novella padded to 350+ pages. There are a few good sections and interesting turns of phrase, but most of the shocks are either overanalyzed so they lose their effectiveness or repeated so often as to become meaningless. Consider a werewolf jumping out of a closet and quickly devouring someone in a messy fashion - that's potentially scary (there are no werewolves in this book, so I haven't spoiled anything for you). Now consider a werewolf jumping out of the closet, freezing in mid-air a la The Matrix or Crouching Tiger, as we take a trip around its leaping form analyzing its yellowed teeth, matted fur, general stinkiness, etc. - by the time the werewolf unfreezes, the scene's literally lost all its momentum, so even if the beast chows down the impact is greatly reduced. Now repeat that three or four times and you've got one yawner of a book. <br /> <br />The House had potential when it started out, but I'll take the B-movie with William Katt and a similar name over this book any day of the week.	2004-08-18
US	50710993	R315YA117R4W6F	0743219600	858842030	Shroud for a Nightingale (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #4)	Books	4	13	16	N	N	The Best of James, The Worst of James	Shroud for a Nightingale is a fair book. If you take into account that it was written early in James' career, you might judge it less harshly as it seems she has learned from her mistakes. <br /> <br />What mistakes? James relies too much in giving her suspects prescience in anticipating Chief Superintendent Adam Dalgliesh's next question. All too frequently his interrogations are punctuated with lines like \\"as if reading Dalgliesh's mind, Nurse Dakers said...\\" or \\"Sister Rolfe said ... as if Dalgliesh had spoken his thoughts aloud.\\" Once or twice would be one thing, or at least allowing Dalgliesh to keep mum to prompt the suspect to fill the awkward silence with an unintended comment, but the frequency of the \\"psychic\\" segue makes it feel like sloppy writing. Another thing James does several times is have Dalgliesh run an unspecified deduction by his sergeant to which the sergeant graciously allows that \\"it might've happened that way.\\" Again, it's sloppy and perhaps even out and out cheating. <br /> <br />Despite these rather appalling weaknesses, James' writing at times is as strong as in her more recent masterpieces. Sergeant Masterson's interrogation a la sadistic tango is wonderful, as is Dalgliesh's attempt to interrogate the housekeeper, Martha Collins. Her pacing is spot on in both cases and in the latter case, her ear for dialect - and ability to transcribe it intelligibly - is amazing. The spooky setting and overall mood of Nightingale house, while perhaps clichd at times (the wandering ghost, the eerie happenings in the conservatory), is nevertheless effective. James provides perhaps too many suspects, but their varied motives and concomitant red herrings give the book a rich and robust texture. <br /> <br />As much as I appreciated having Dalgliesh avoid the potentially trite and clichd path at the end of the book, I'm really not satisfied with the way James wrapped up the mystery. Without spoiling the ending, let me say that while it certainly \\"could\\"have happened that way, I would have liked to see Dalgliesh find some way to resolve things differently. <br /> <br />Despite some significant flaws, Shroud for a Nightingale, remains a well plotted and decently constructed mystery. As a piece of fiction that presents its hero as a work in progress, the book is highly enjoyable, though not entirely satisfying.	2004-08-16

Beaumont Mystery, But Don't Make It Your First	Minor in Possession opens with Seattle homicide detective Beaumont drying out in an Arizona rehab clinic. Despite non-stop rainshowers and a rising river, Beau is still a fish out of water, trying to cope with a soon-to-deceased roommate, hostile clinic staff, and visiting family members dredging up his unfortunate past. It'd be enough to drive a person to drink, except of course that's the reason he's in rehab to begin with.    Following his roommate's demise and an attempt on his own life, Beau finds himself on both sides of the investigation and travelling around the state in an ever-increasing number of rental cars. The action is fast, and so are some of the women he meets. The ending is a bit overly sentimental, but getting there is certainly fun.    I thoroughly enjoyed this book. My only caveat is don't let this be the first J.P. Beaumont mystery you read. If you're not familiar with the Seattle detective's history - his lifestyle or marriage to Anne Corley, for instance - read Until Proven Guilty or the more recent Partner in Crime before reading this novel. References to Corley and things like Beau's Porsche are dropped in unaccompanied by much context, which is unusual for Jance. Unless you know what she's talking about, you'll be as much a fish out of water as her detective is at times while tackling this mystery.	2004-08-06

Early on there were a couple moments when I thought Jacques was going to lose me - for instance, why do fish lack the sentience of the terrestrial creatures? - but as time went on they became fewer and further between. <br /> <br />As someone who grew up with animal books like Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH and Kipling's Just So Stories, I found that Redwall holds up well with those classics. The book is definitely structured for young readers: there are few moral ambiguities in characterizations, in most cases foreshadowing is almost immediately resolved, and there's an extremely happy ending. Given that, the book also has a surprisingly high body count; granted I recall that Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom was brutal at times, but there's rarely a skirmish here where someone doesn't meet a grisly end. Ultimately, I think the messages of teamwork, good triumphing over evil, and a healthy appreciation for nutbrown ale, er, I mean, the realization that the smallest among us are not necessarily the least will remain with readers longer than the  particularly sticky demises of the book's major villains ... at least I hope so. <br /> <br />Right now my son's in the Winnie-the-Pooh stage of animal books (although he does enjoy the Rats of NIMH DVD). When he gets a bit older and outgrows those - not that we ever really do - I'll probably give this series a try with him. I'm a bit concerned with the issues of mortality it might raise, but if I read it with him I'll be able to judge his sensitivities firsthand. All in all, the Redwall series appears to be a winner.	2004-08-05

Written conversationally (admittedly one-sided, unless you're given to talking to inanimate objects), the book provides a frank and surprisingly objective look at Campbell's life and career.    The book begins with Campbell's childhood in rural/suburban Michigan and the transformation that took place in high school when he met the Raimi brothers. How Campbell's career intersects time and again with the Raimi's and other high school cohorts is presented throughout the book. When one thinks of Hollywood bigshots, backstabbing and betrayal come to mind before lifelong friendships. Perhaps that explains why Bruce Campbell isn't a Hollywood bigshot - but why he has a huge fan following nonetheless.    In detailing the blood (Karo syrup-based and real), sweat and tears that went into making the first Evil Dead feature, the book presents scenes that are as horrifying as anything in the movie itself (it also provides the best tangential recipe I've come across since I read Clifford Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg), but it also makes it seem like a ton of fun. Probably a quarter of the book is devoted to the Evil Dead process: conception, prototype, capital-raising, filming, editing, distribution, etc. Even with the documentary features on the Evil Dead DVDs, there's plenty of new information here. If you're not aware of what goes into making a feature film, this is an eye opener.    Campbell doesn't go into as much detail about what goes into TV production, but he does share some interesting and amusing anecdotes (including details of David Duchovny's embarrassing flatulence problems).    Perhaps the most interesting part of the autobiography deals with the impact the 9/11 attack had on the promotional tour for the first edition of the book. Three years later, when most discussion of the event involves finger-pointing and blame-placing, it is interesting to read Campbell's take on how he and his wife did their best to keep their lives on course in the days and weeks after the WTC bombings. If you hadn't already gotten that Campbell is a do-whatever-it-takes trouper in the main body of the book, it becomes eminently clear in the appendix.    If you're a Bruce Campbell fan like I am, buy this book. Even if you don't want to make it big in the film industry, you'll find yourself yearning for a digital camera and a couple gullible friends by the time you finish reading it.	2004-08-04

Faced with defeating a warmongering interplanetary force, James DiGriz infiltrates his way in by assuming another's identity (complete with facial alteration) then procedes to bluff and improvise his way through increasingly hazardous conditions. DiGriz is cornered several times, captured twice, but always manages to avoid getting his neck snapped in a trap. <br />  <br /> There's nothing particularly groundbreaking in this novel. DiGriz is cut of the same cloth as most gentleman rogues. The story has a couple deus ex machina moments, but nothing intolerable. I thought the escape from the airfield was nicely handled, and Harrison was able to introduce The Planet of Warrior Women into the story without degenerating into &quot;Bill the Galactic Hero&quot; nonsense. <br />  <br /> If you enjoyed the first novel in the series, you'll likely enjoy this one also. If you haven't read the first one, go ahead and read it before this one - it introduces a couple characters and makes their all-to-brief appearances here more enjoyable.	2004-08-02

Equal parts brainstorming/word association and playing &quot;What If,&quot; Bradbury's method of getting words on the page is deceptively simple. Fortunately, Bradbury also goes into detail about how to stock your supply cupboard with people and images and emotions so when the time comes to use them (or they come out to be used), you'll have them at hand. While the book is more geared to the art of short story writing, the overarching theme of writing with gusto works for novelists as well. <br />  <br /> Bradbury admits to using the reference to Eastern philosophy as a hook to get readers (those accepting of it as well as those indignant at the notion, yet curious enough to find out what he's talking about). Ultimately, Bradbury doesn't advocate switching from Western to Eastern thought, nor are koans sprinkled throughout the book, but he does address coming to a point where you can work without laboring and achieving a state where your words flow from you and through you effortlessly. In this way of becoming one with the universes of your creation, Bradbury is certainly a Master. <br />  <br /> The one area where the book falls short, though, is in handling the revision and editing of your work. It's all well and good to talk of writing with verve and gusto (and it is well and it is good to do so), but Bradbury doesn't explain how to look at it after the fact objectively and with a critical eye. Granted, this isn't a how-to primer, but the enthusiasm of writing the story can be all too easily quashed by rejection notices if what is written well isn't well-written. <br />  <br /> Nevertheless, Bradbury's message is inspirational, and if his method has worked for him for 50+ years there's no doubt it can be a successful technique. Even if you come away from the this book without being prepared to follow in his footsteps, you will still be inspired to be passionateabout your work.	2004-07-23

James Patterson's &quot;girl power&quot; numbered novels are written with a naivete that is at turns laughable, yet refreshing. If the storyline could never happen, then why not populate it with powerful-yet-vulnerable women? Certainly such women exist, though it's unlikely to find them in such a concentration or with such complementary abilities. It doesn't matter, in the end, since Patterson crafts such a fast-paced read, and plausibility is dispensed with from the get-go.<br /><br /> 2nd Chance, coincidentally the second outing for the Women's Murder Club, is an enjoyable read. Despite its 400-page length it has a brisk pace and brief 3- to 4-page chapters that usually incorporate a full-page of white space between the chapters' opening and closing pages.<br /><br /> Along with the emergence of a new San Franciscan serial killer, the story also details the private lives of its four protagonists: one's pregnant, one's wayward father returns, one finds a new love, and more than one finds herself in the killer's crosshairs. All of this makes for a highly charged read, if you can keep your disbelief suspended long enough.<br /><br /> There are a couple plot holes (for instance, how likely is it that the killer would leave no forensic clues save the same sneaker prints with the same traces of chalk at multiple crime scenes - yet neglect to remove the tissue samples underneath the fingernails of one of his victims) and a couple forgotten clues (e.g., Boxer neglects to set the FBI agent straight on the link between the 911 tape and the mythology textbook, thus linking murder #3 with the others). Still, the story holds together fairly well, and by the time you've finished shouting &quot;tell him about the 911 tape&quot; at the book, Patterson's thrown another twist into the story and you're sucked in again.<br /><br /> If you're looking for a good read with a pro-woman message that doesn't demean men and have a long flight, a day at the beach - or jury duty, in my case - give this book a try.

Lately it seems when I've started reading a mystery series I've started in the middle or at the end of things. I was quite pleased when I came across this book, helpfully labelled &quot;The First Richard Jury Novel!&quot;, and decided to turn over two new leaves: starting a new series and beginning at the beginning for a change.<br />I found the first couple chapters a bit of tough sledding. Grimes, an American author intent on establishing the setting and tone of an &quot;English Mystery&quot; lays on the Anglicized idioms a bit thick. By about a third of the way through, though, either she laid off or I started to roll with it because I was fully into the story at that point. <br />If you've read her later books, you can probably eliminate quite a few of the suspects on the grounds that they show up later with no mention of being homicidal maniacs. As a first-time-reader I spent a lot of time guessing whodunit (or, rather, hoping someone hadn't done it - &quot;Oh, don't let it be him&quot; and &quot;Oh, don't let it be her&quot;). The ending relies on the knowledge of a bit of English geographic trivia (well, I suppose it's not trivial to the people who live there), but there are a few other clues that savvy sleuths can use to get the job done just as well.<br />While Richard Jury isn't a Poirot, Wimsey, or Dalgliesh (at least not in his first outing), he still is a first-rate literary creation. If you're looking to start a new series of detective fiction, this is a good place to begin. After the first book, I know I'm hooked.	2004-07-16

Sayers is an incredible glimpse of a woman who worked hard to keep her public and private lives separate. Written primarily as a response to other biographies, which drew conclusions from the apparent surface details of Sayers' life, Brabazon presents - with the blessing and support of Sayers' son, Anthony - evidence from unpublished manuscripts and other source material to which other authors have lacked access. What emerges is a compelling and well-supported history of one of England's, if not the world's, finest writing minds of the Twentieth Century.<br />Tracking Sayers' life from her early years at Oxford, to her formative years in rural England, then back to Oxford for University, Brabazon weaves the thread that these influences, good and bad, had on young Miss Sayers. Then the war came, and Brabazon demonstrates how that - and the subsequent loss of eligible bachelors - had a profound effect on the course of Sayers' life, the outcome of which seems to be that Sayers created her ideal man in the form of Lord Peter Wimsey. Sayers did, Brabazon reveals, have at least three great love affairs, two of which ended unsatisfactorily - the second resulting in the birth of her son - the third ending in marriage. Due to help from Sayers' letters, her family and friends, Brabazon is able to chart the course of Sayers' public copy- and novel-writing career and her private family life. This ability for Sayers to keep things separate - and for her biographer to recombine them - continues through her years as a theological writer and playwright, and up to the end of her life.<br />There are a few problems with the biography, however. Because the book was written as a defense against poorly researched biographies, the author seems to present the unknown side of Sayers at the expense of details that other biographers had written and gotten right. The consequent lack of context can be frustrating when detail is provided without first establishing its background. For instance, a great deal is made of Sayers work in establishing sound doctrinal texts for the Anglican church; however, Brabazon doesn't go into what was going on within the church to prompt Sayers to take such action. Also, Brabazon pays Sayers several compliments on the work she did on her translation of Dante's epic poetry, but fails to actual cite any of it. Finally, and this is a minor nit, the chapters are numbered, but not titled; an adequate index is provided - and the book is written chronologically - but having titled chapters (\\"Oxford Years,\\" \\"The Great War,\\" etc.) would make it easier to backtrack to significant moments in Sayers' life.<br />Despite some minor flaws, this really is an amazing look into Dorothy L. Sayers' life. The portrait that emerges of a woman succeeding on her own terms, while remaining faithful to what she felt was a higher calling, serves to inspire Brabazon's readers to pursue similar ambitions. If all you know of Sayers' work is her Wimsey novels (a deficiency I admit to), you're missing at least half what made her such an amazing writer. For me, this biography revealed not only details of Sayers' life that were unexpected,  but also a body of work that I'm eagerly anticipating reading in the months and years to come.l is provided without first establishing its background.

US	50710993	R18VX9RILT9FJT	1857984986	846400171	The Stainless Steel Rat	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Brief Yet Entertaining	More a novella (short; single plot thread; character exploration, not development) than novel, The Stainless Steel Rat is nevertheless an enjoyable read. I'm not a hard-core science fiction fan, and my prior experience with Harrison is limited to the first three \\"Bill the Galactic Hero\\" novels, so I'm pleased with how accessible and well plotted this story is.<br />The story itself concerns the doings of uber-criminal James \\"Slippery Jim\\" DiGriz. After a brief introduction to his crime skills, the story shifts to what happens after DiGriz is \\"recruited\\" by law enforcement to go after his fellow criminal masterminds. What follows are the details of his discovery of a plot to create a massive space-warship and his adventures as he sets out to shut it - and the criminals behind the plot - down.<br />While nothing earth shattering happens, DiGriz's exploits are entertaining and a fine way to spend a summer's afternoon or two. I look forward to reading the next book in the series with some trepidation - after the way Bill books went downhill fast - but I'll likely give it a try nonetheless. One thing's for certain and that's that this book was more than worth the short while it took to read it. Hopefully the next one(s) will be, too.	2004-07-09
US	50710993	RDI56SUOWWDJF	0061043532	776161189	Clouds of Witness	Books	3	17	20	N	N	Shades of the Future	Clouds of Witness is a good book, but not among Sayers best. Written early in her career, the story allows one to feel that there will be greater books yet to come, but this - alas - is not that book. The book suffers mainly because it feels as if Sayers is emulating other writers (at one point Wimsey refers to his &quot;gray cells&quot;), and not trusting her own voice enough. It's understandable, given that this is her sophomore outing, but it's regrettable that it isn't quite what a modern reader might think of as a \\"Dorothy L. Sayers mystery.\\"<br />The characters, women particularly, are well fleshed-out stereotypes. We have the noble fool (Lady Mary), the gold-digger (Simone Vonderaa), and the caged bird set free (Mrs. Grimethorpe). Even the legal team of Murbles and Biggs are set at the far ends of the spectrum of lawyerly caricature (Biggs' closing argument is an especially hammy monologue).<br />While it's nice to meet Wimsey's family, the rest of the hunting party is mostly useless (murder victim excepted). Wimsey and D.I. Parker's camaraderie is enjoyable, though the latter likely has a conflict of interest - doubly so, given his attraction to Lady Mary, Wimsey's sister and the deceased's fiancée.<br />My greatest frustration with the book has to do with the way the emerald-eyed cat charm is handled. Although its ownership is proven relatively early in the book Wimsey and Parker keep trying to determine if it belonged to someone else. It seems Sayers wants it to be a red herring, but in light of the fact that we know whose it is - as do Wimsey and Parker - it just doesn't work. Sayers also tries her hand at adventure writing, most notably in the \\"foggy bog\\" and \\"trans-Atlantic flight\\" scenes; in these she succeeds and it's a pity that in the future these dramatic touches are saved mainly for scenes involving the detective and his Daimler. <br />Even though the book has several shortcomings it's still an entertaining piece of writing. It does better at charting the rise of one of England's finest authors than as a literary masterpiece in its own right, but for all that Sayers fans should be sure not to overlook this early treasure.	2004-07-04
US	50710993	RZU3XMBSPMUXZ	0425155722	35064043	The Fool's Run (Kidd)	Books	4	10	12	N	N	An Entertaining, Behind-the-Scenes Look at TechnoCrime	The Fool's Run provides a good light-hearted read as well as a nostalgic glimpse at the state of high-technology in the late '80s. While the Amigas and PC-ATs of yesteryear may no longer be the computing tools of choice, they really were sexy back in their day. Reading about them brought back memories and, for me at least, added to my enjoyment of the book. If you've never used anything older than a Pentium-2, that part of the story may seem hopelessly passe, but such is life.<br />The plot may also seem a little dated, but only because it's been used as recently as the big-screen version of Charlie's Angels. Sure you can see things coming chapters ahead of time, but that's due as much to foreshadowing (Kidd's use of the Tarot comes in handy here) as predictability.<br />Despite the presence of a lot of then-current computer equipment, the book glosses over how it's used in Kidd's crime spree. Of course, it's really hard to keep a reader's interest if you include everything in great detail (who wants to listen to the horrible screeching of a Hayes modem or get into arcane DOS commands or hear the expletives following a ***carrier dropped*** or BSoD message?). Suffice it to say that you'll learn a lot more about how to break into suburban homes through the front door than through a firewall.<br />There's a lot of bed-hopping going on between the covers of the book. Granted, AIDS wouldn't have been big in the national consciousness at the time the book was written, but STDs in general would have been an issue. Then again, a book told from the criminal's point-of-view really can't moralize overmuch (there's also a bit of drug use, sniper-style executions, and the aforementioned housebreaking to add to the mix of kids-don't-try-this-at-home activities performed by Kidd and LuEllen).<br />I found The Fool's Run an enjoyable read, slightly more enjoyable than The Devil's Code. If you're looking for a fast-paced novel with a retro-tech angle, this one ought to fit the bill..	2004-06-22

At times it's funny, at times sad, but it's always honest in its portrayal of the challenges of growing up and parenting in the latter half of the Twentieth Century (I expect things are not so different here at the beginning of the Twenty-First).<br />It also has a lot of good information on raising a Christian family. If anything, it may have too much because this is where the book stumbles slightly: Either the letters were written with an eye to evangelize/enlighten its public readership or things were tweaked during the editing process. For example, the Campolos are constantly explaining the plan for salvation to each other (I'm not anti-evangelism, but it seems odd that these two strong Believers would need to make sure the other was clear on the process of becoming a Christian). At another point Tony Campolo relates an anecdote to his son wherein an employee of his is conned by an unscrupulous motorist (Chapter 8). In the process Campolo writes, &quot;Ralph, one of the inner-city missionaries who works with our organization, the Evangelical Association for the Promotion of Education (EAPE), in Philadelphia...&quot;. Is Bart really unaware of his father's organization and its location? Granted, Dr. Campolo has many irons in the fire, but here and elsewhere in the book parts of the letters seem written for an unknown reader rather than for father or son.<br />In the grand scheme of things, these are but minor nits (and what's up with the red underlined passages?). The book is filled with a lot of great 20/20-hindsight observations and suggestions for raising children. It has value for older teens to read, too, especially in the second half of the book where college and careers are discussed.<br />I don't know if this book will appeal to everyone as much as it did to me. As the father of a 4-year-old son, the book really expanded my perspective on Fatherhood. Regardless of where you are in your life, Chapter 10 (&quot;Figuring Out What Really Matters&quot;) really boils down how to create a great relationship between Parent and Child. If you buy this book and feel that it isn't for you (it gets a bit Sociological here and there), please jump to the last chapter before giving up. It may inspire you to go back and read what you skipped, but if not it will at least present you with great information on how to strengthen your family.<br />While this isn't a perfect book, I highly recommend it for anyone seeking to build a strong relationship with their children. Dr. Campolo and his son were very courageous in allowing us this peek into the foundations of their family life; reading this book was a privilege and a blessing.	2004-06-19
US	50710993	R1P4RAZVBIEW4X	0743219589	991069096	A Mind to Murder (Adam Dalgliesh Mysteries, No. 2)	Books	4	53	53	N	N	Simple and Straight-Forward	I found this early mystery by P.D. James to be quite an enjoyable read. In her later books she tends to go a little overboard  giving her characters interior monologues, but she doesn't do that much here. We learn a little about Superintendent Dalgliesh's late wife and his feelings for her, but there's no angsty-ness to it. Dalgliesh does worry that he won't be able to crack the case, but with the number of correct hunches he plays James does well to keep him humble.<br />The mystery, like the characters, is pretty straightforward too. James fairly well leads you down the path of whom to suspect, but throws in a couple inconsistencies to keep you guessing. Ultimately those inconsistencies are explained and the ending is given the obligatory twist. The story could have done with a few less characters: Keeping track of who's who and to whom they're doing what got muddy a couple times. Still, James does a good job of isolating the few key characters and if you keep steadily marching forward it's not too hard to keep up.<br />There is a charming naivete about this story. A modern author would have to have some of the LSD (medicinal purposes only) get mixed in with Dalgliesh's tea, and the electroshock therapy room and creaking dumbwaiter would have to be put to equally sinister purposes as well. While there is a lot of sexual activity going on at the clinic, nothing prurient takes place within the pages of the book; there's one morning-after scene and James does bring herself to write the word \\"thigh\\" a couple times, but that's about as smutty as it gets.<br />At this point in her writing career, James hasn't quite found her voice yet. Nevertheless, she's able to craft an above-average mystery with well-developed male and female characters. Having read some of her more-complicated novels before reading this, I wasn't put off by the simplicity of it. I don't know if the reverse would hold true: If you read this before books like \\"A Taste for Death\\" or \\"Skull Beneath theSkin,\\" you might find her later work overwhelming. Regardless, this stands on its own as a good mystery by a great mystery writer.	2004-06-12

Countless digressions and flashbacks prevent the story from building up much tension. The opening chapter serves as a good case in point: When threatened with execution, Alfie Winser's life literally passes in front of his eyes. This seems witty at first, until it begins (and continues) to happen to people whose lives are not in similar jeopardy. In the final 75 pages or so the pot finally begins to boil, but we're left with such a waterlogged mess that the climax lacks any real punch.<br />The story revolves around Oliver Single, one half of the book's title and junior partner of the story's eponymous capital investment firm. After experiencing ethical business qualms he leaves the firm, revealing its secrets to and British Intelligence and allowing them to set him up with a new identity. Of course, that never goes to plan, and coincident with his cover getting blown, Winser is killed and his father disappears. There's nothing left to do but for Oliver to become a junior G-man, find his dad, thwart the villains, and save the day. Sure, that's a pretty simplistic overview; on the way he has to fool around with three or four women, too.<br />If you enjoy psychoanalyzing things, you'll get a kick out of this book. Everybody has issues. Everybody's in denial. From the obligatory psychopathy and transgenerational child abandonment to exhibitionism and German-engineered phallic symbols, this book has it all.  If, on the other hand, you like a tale of espionage, cat and mouse, cross and double-cross ... well, there's always the Smiley books.<br />In the end, Single &amp; Single is a love story between a son and his father, so perhaps it's only natural that there be an Oedipal angle to the whole thing. If you go into it aware of what you're getting yourself into, perhaps you'll enjoy it more than I did. At any rate, the scene where Yevgeny Orlov asks Oliver to hop on his motorcycle (&quot;Ride it, Post Boy! Ride it!&quot; (p. 179)) takes on a whole new meaning when looked at from a Freudian point of view.	2004-06-05

On TV the director can show us Mulder cogitating for a couple seconds and then present his latest \\"out there\\" theory. Grant has the opportunity to let us inside Mulder's brain, but he also has the responsibility to keep us hooked once we get in there - what if Mulder doesn't think like we think he thinks? What if the story starts dragging? What if there's nothing there? Fortunately, Grant did a pretty good job of it, although Scully occasionally seemed a little flighty.<br />The story, I thought, got off to a bit of a shaky start. With the first two victims being drunks, I was afraid the story was going to be a one-note moral symphony like X-Files: Ground Zero. The good news is that it doesn't. Unfortunately, the story lacks any clear Alien/Supernatural X-File connection. Human chameleons are an interesting story element, but there should at least be a suggestion of the use of \\"Area 42 Alien Technology (TM)\\". If we're to accept that it's just military research gone amok, there should be a wide range of chameleon mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. It may be the vogue thing to paint the military as pure evil, but beginning research with human test subjects is more poor science than it is sheer evilness.<br />The book tries to be as sexy as the TV show, but never really generates any heat. Sure we get a shower scene with Scully (let your minds ponder that for a moment, lads), and Dr. Elkhorn has some kissy moments, but although rookie agent Licia Andrews is described sexily, her character never really goes anywhere with it. Not that the novel needs to get smutty, but it seems a conscious decision was made in describing her and nothing (either flirtyness or frigidity) comes of it. And, ladies, you just got a raw deal when Mulder slept in his suit; I feel for you. Maybe it's just that there are just some things you can do on Fox TVthat publisher HarperPrism can't.<br />Like any episode of The X-Files we're left with questions at the end of the book. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear we'll ever get answers to them. Pretty much everything that took place at the Jefferson Memorial remained unclear to me throughout the book. The Louisiana connection offered late in the book seemed sketchy to me, especially since it was never backed up from the military side. <br />As this is the first novelization for the series, I can cut the author some slack (hence three stars instead of two). If it seems I expected a bit much of the first outing, it's only because I like(d) the series so much. Grant, in my opinion, certainly did a better job of this than did the author of Ground Zero. When you wear out your Season 9 DVDs and are looking for another adventure before the next theatrical release, this isn't a bad choice. It's not perfect, but it's definitely not worse than any of the more muddled TV episodes.	2004-05-30

First, Sayers transcribes most of the dialogue preserving the native Scottish accents of her characters. Occasionally she'll allow a character to have so thick a brogue that she'll simultaneously translate for the reader. However, it frequently takes several times through a conversation to make sure you're reading it properly. A glossary at the end of the book would have helped immensely (everybody say Imph'm). The other strike against the book is that five red herrings is a couple kippers too many. Combined with the dialectic nature of the book, there are simply too many people (suspects, police, railroad employees, servants, etc.) to keep track of at the same time.<br />Fortunately, Sayers doesn't get the fatal third strike. She weaves a complex web and sets master sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey in the middle of it. The obvious wit in her other novels is obscured somewhat by the accents, but enough shines through to keep the overall tone light. Bunter disappears about halfway through, but while he's on the scene he's as wonderful as ever. Tracking Farren and Wimsey's re-creation of the murderer's alibi were, for me, the high points of the story.<br />I'm sure Dorothy Sayers knew the risks she was taking in crafting such a detailed, complex mystery. That it doesn't entirely work for an American reader in the 21st Century probably isn't ruining her afterlife much. I've found myself hopelessly outclassed on several occasions when reading the Wimsey series, and under those circumstances I find it most helpful to get in Wimsey's Daimler with him and go along for the ride. The trip is always breathtaking (as most of Wimsey's passengers can attest), and while Lord Peter may know where he's going sooner than I do, he doesn't get there too far ahead of me. Don't let my criticisms of this book dissuade you from giving it a read; it's tough in parts, but well worth the effort.	2004-05-22

Unfortunately, there are just too many different scams being run, and each likely to have numerous variations, that little more than a sampling can be presented in 200 pages.<br />The message of the book can be boiled down to \\"if it sounds too good to be true it probably is.\\" You could print that on a 3x5 card, laminate it, and save the purchase price of this book, but someone unscrupulous could probably still get to you (then again, if you're that tight, maybe they couldn't).<br />Whitlock stresses that we need to be eternally vigilant against those who would rip you off, that a con man (or woman) cannot be identified by appearance alone, and that desperate people a capable of doing any thing (and being either scammer or scammee). While it's nice to have this knowledge, it's in the examples Whitlock provides that these points are really driven home.<br />While other books may go into more detail on any given con artist approach (charity scams, social engineering, online cons, etc.), Scam School lets you see some approaches you might have not have realized were possibilities. In an appendix it also gives you suggestions of who to contact in case you think you are being or have been scammed.<br />I found this to be an interesting and informative book, and since I finished reading it earlier this afternoon I haven't been scammed once. Maybe you think you're already  scam-proof without this book's help, in which case I have a 3x5 card that can save you millions - I'll sell it to you cheap.	2004-05-11

Still trying to cope with the murder of her late husband, Sheriff Brady also has to cope with murder, suicide, undocumented aliens, a weaselly governor, workplace squabbling , and hostile newspaperfolk. Add to that enough mother-daughter conflict and examples of marital frustration to rival The Joy Luck Club, and you've got a novel that keeps things hopping.<br />The only area in which the book falls short is when it reveals the murderer of Bucky Buckwalter. I've read Chapter 20 several times and motivations still don't make a lot of sense.<br />This book has a great deal of character development in it, as well as the advancement of several of the ongoing subplots. If you've read later books, but not this one you'll find it helpful in its detailing, among other things, Marianne Maculyea's adoption experience, how Jenny gets Kiddo the horse, Butch Dixon coming on the scene, and Eleanor and Doc Winfield hooking up.<br />While the mystery falls a little flat at the end, Jance does an excellent job keeping the pace up and developing her characters and storylines. While I wouldn't suggest this as the first Joanna Brady novel you read - pick up Desert Heat or Partners in Crime for that - this is definitely a don't-miss book.	2004-05-10

Among the disparate sci-fi references are Star Trek: TOS, Han Solo & Chewbacca, time travel, cyberpunk, and likely several others. Any one or two of these could be utilized in a first-rate parody - but that book would be a distant cousin several times removed from this book. What we have here, instead, is a hodge-podge of tangential references that momentarily amuse (if that) but come nowhere near providing a satisfying story. If you're a fan of the printed word you might like this book, because that's really all it amounts to: words printed on paper with the usual punctuation thrown in to form sentences. There's a vestigial plot, an intrusive narrative structure, faux profanity, alleged sex, and such low-grade humor that the puns in Book 2 seem like Mamet in retrospect - all of which I'm sure appeal to some audience out there, I just don't think I'm a part of it anymore.<br />Most of my frustration with the book is that plot points are raised, but never go anywhere. For instance, we are presented at one point with the Alterna-Crew of the USS Enterprise (cleverly renamed here the Gumption) from the \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" TV episode. We encounter them once, and they're referred to a couple more times, but nothing actually happens with them beyond getting Bill from plot point 1 to plot point 1.1 - and we really could have gone from point 0.9 to 1.2 and never noticed anything amiss. Likewise, we're told that the Alien Historian is trying to alter the past to create a future without war - and that he's succeeding; but we never encounter a single instance of an altered timeline as we travel from cover to cover. If these were isolated instances Harrison and Sheckley might be forgiven, but nothing of consequence ever takes place in the book and large sections could be removed without affecting the story on either side of it.<br />If you have a few hours to kill and are given the choice between reading this book or taking up self-dentistry, check to see if you'll get any anesthetic first. You won't want to read this book without it.	2004-05-03
US	50710993	R1KC1SD0QCHOYN	0736910034	145521296	The Power of Praying® Together: Where Two or More Are Gathered…	Books	5	68	68	N	N	Not What I Expected ... But Still Great	After her books Power of a Praying Wife and Power of a Praying Husband, I expected this to be more along the lines of a Praying Couples book. Instead, Stormie went with a look at prayer groups and congregational prayer. This is not a bad thing, in fact I found it an excellent book, but if, like me, you're looking for a book to draw yourself closer to your spouse in prayer, be forewarned that this is not that book. Buy it anyway.<br />This book spends more time dealing with the subjects of \\"what prayer is\\" and \\"why you should pray\\" than her other books. It also goes into how to pray and different kinds of prayers (confession, intercession, etc.). If you're a new Christian or haven't had much of a prayer life, this is an excellent book to get you started.<br />The entire book is great, but my favorite section is where Jack Hayford describes people who pray as lightning rods, acting as the conduit through which God exerts his power on Earth (pp. 91-92). There are a lot of powerful word pictures like that throughout the book; that's just the one that hit home with me.<br />The only thing I didn't like about the book is that Jack Hayford's comments on prayer are all related in the past tense. Granted, some of them are included as part of actual past events, conversations or sermons, and there it's totally appropriate. Elsewhere, though, the verb tense should have been modified to make them feel more current. It's not a big thing, but it does make his comments feel dated.<br />As I said before, if you don't know much about prayer or you don't spend much time praying this is an ideal book for you. If you do have a prayer life, but it's grown stale or could use a good goosing, this book is for you, too. I still think &quot;The Power of Praying Spouses&quot; would make a good book, but I'm glad Stormie has written this book as well.	2004-04-27

By covering the gamut of the mystery genre - from treasure hunt to espionage, from cypher (in a devilishly hard crossword) to ghost story, with an occasional straightforward dead body thrown in for old times' sake - Lord Peter is in danger of eclipsing Bunter as the World's Greatest Overachiever.<br />As is frequently the case, trying to match wits with Wimsey is often an exercise in futility. Unless you are fluent in French you'll miss one villain's slip of the tongue (I caught the gist of the conversation in &quot;The Entertaining Episode of the Article in Question,&quot; but nowhere near enough to keep up with Lord Peter). In the crossword puzzle mystery I answered a whopping one of the sixty-four clues correctly. Still, there are a couple stories where you can get there ahead of Wimsey, and a few where you can at least see where he's going even if you can't beat him there.<br />My favorite of the twelve is &quot;The Learned Adventure of the Dragon's Head&quot; not only because I deduced the location of the buried treasure ahead of Wimsey, but because his avuncular counsel of young Gherkins is priceless. &quot;The Unsolved Puzzle of the Man with No Face&quot; seems to be the genesis of Sayers' later novel Have His Carcase, but with Wimsey solving the case solo (and without the maddening cypher). It's in short stories such as these that we are able to fully explore Lord Peter's character and appreciate Sayers' craft.<br />All of these stories are gems. Not all are equal, however. There are a few carbuncles among the diamonds, but all are much better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. Don't worry if you feel at sea at the beginning of some of these stories (only one brief scene in one of the stories actually takes place at sea): Lord Peter is not always revealed immediately, nor is what's going on always eminently clear. Patience pays off and stick-to-itiveness is always rewarded.	2004-04-27
US	50710993	R3B1VKIJ2YFVFP	0061013439	995699181	The Run	Books	3	2	2	N	N	The New Center Provides Middle-of-the-Road Reading	Will Lee, a southern senator (D-Ga.), is the lead character in this novel. He's bland, relatively inoffensive, Centrist, and by-golly he'd like to be your friend if not your next president. The novel shares a lot of these traits, too: It's eager to please, but there's not a lot to get excited about.<br />The most exciting parts in the book are focused on a survivalist nutjob intent on assassinating Lee. His motives are never clearly defined (perhaps reading \\"Grass Roots\\" would help, but this was my first Woods novel), but he seems to know his stuff; he's got the preparation of his plot down pat, but falls short in its execution (pun intended).<br />Because Lee is such a \\"nice\\" guy and won't sling mud at his opponent, the campaign is dull and thankfully kept to a minimum. Unfortunately, as a result of Lee's personality and actions, his political opponents have nothing against which to act as a foil. In fact, we'd have to believe the Republicans are as dull as Lee were it not for a blackmailing campaign run by an incarcerated former CIA executive.<br />Somehow, Woods manages to create a world where Bill Clinton was impeached, but a different administration is in office at the beginning of 2000. A lot of flak is aimed in the Republicans' direction, and Woods has the Democrats retaining the presidency, taking back the House, and almost getting the Senate as a consequence of voter revolt over the impeachment proceedings. Please, Righties, take a deep breath and remind yourself that this is fiction (doubly-so, since nothing of the sort actually happened). Still, most of the Republicans come off as bland as the Democrats, and there's really little to get your briefs (or boxers) in a twist.<br />The Run is ultimately undone by its Centrist positioning. By staying middle-of-the-road in its liberal v. conservative positioning and not giving Lee any flaws to exploit or defend, Woods fails to generate any heat in this novel. As many other Amazon reviewers have noted, it's a good way to kill a few hours, but it's just not a very good novel.	2004-04-19
US	50710993	R2FTLNCCYAE0Q2	0451170822	905968185	Houses without Doors (Signet)	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Evocative, But Never Pretentious	This collection of short stories lifts its title from an Emily Dickinson poem (\\"Doom is the house without a door...\\"). There is a sense of doom pervading each of the stories, as the major characters are cursed by psychological maladies (psychosis, repression, obsession) or are forced to interact with powers beyond their (and our) comprehension. Some of the stories end with the characters clearly not escaping their doom (most notably in \\"The Buffalo Hunter\\"), while others leave it to the reader to guess at the outcome (\\"Mrs. God,\\" \\"The Juniper Tree\\"). All of the stories, including the interludes, work overtime to produce a dark mood and an off-kilter worldview.<br />\\"The Buffalo Hunter\\" and \\"Mrs. God\\" were my favorites. The former presents a loner who gets lost in his own imagined relationships and later in the paperback novels he reads. I'm a fan of Raymond Chandler's work, so Straub's pastiche of \\"The Lady in the Lake\\" was particularly enjoyable. If I were more familiar with Anna Karenina I might have had a better appreciation for the ending of the short story, but as it was I sensed something bad coming and Straub didn't disappoint. \\"Mrs. God\\" felt a lot like Ghost Story to me; particularly nice was the way Henry James and other authors were woven into the piece. I had read \\"Blue Rose\\" when Penguin issued it as a stand-alone mini-book in the mid-90's; it's the \\"oogiest\\" of all the stories - even the second time through it still creeped me out and made me slightly nauseated.<br />I enjoyed these stories a great deal. Straub can be crueler and more terrifying than some of his contemporaries, even while his syntax and phraseology are more refined. If you're a fan of Straub's or the psychological/horror genres in general you'll likely enjoy this book. Beyond that, there aren't many to whom I'd recommend this collection of short fiction, unless it would be a student who wants to see how words can be used effectively to create mood and transport readers to worlds they'dnot likely find on their own.	2004-04-17
US	50710993	R2DMFZKKPND49Q	0380718421	260931568	Name Withheld: A J.P. Beaumont Mystery	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Fair to Middling Mystery	Buried in all of J.P. Beaumont's personal problems in this novel is a halfway decent mystery. Between problems with his family, a child-services investigation, the insufferable Paul Kramer, his superiors in the Seattle P.D. (who seem to have forgotten that Detective Beaumont is a top-notch investigator), rush hour traffic, and the siren song of a MacNaughton's bottle, J.A. Jance somehow manages to shoehorn a triple murder into Beau's life. What any of it has to do with the blood-dripping icicle on the cover is beyond me.<br />Other reviewers here at Amazon have commented on how overcrowded the book is with Beau's personal problems, and they're right. Either the family crisis or the child-services subplots could have been eliminated and the story would be stronger for it. Either would have sufficed to add depth to Beau's character, but the two of them together is overkill. With all the extra-vocational content in the book, we are left with quite a few loose ends; very little of Kramer &amp; Arnold's side of the investigation makes it into the story, and Beau changes objectives suddenly without having time to go back and follow up on earlier leads. <br />It goes without saying that \\"detective\\" Paul Kramer is going to cause problems, but for Sergeant Watkins and Captain Powell to heap on the grief makes little sense (good natured ribbing about Beau's transsexual fan club would have been appropriate; they should have at least heard his side of the story before climbing down his throat); it would be one thing if Beau was an underperformer, but the unceasing gruff boss shtick made no sense.<br />One thing that Jance does do well in the book is convey a sense of how different police work is from what's shown on TV (how different it really is from the book's presentation is another question). From needing evidence ahead of getting an arrest warrant to ballistics and DMV registration checks, Beau does a good job of doing the routine business of police work. If he could learnto do periodic \\"saves\\" of his police reports on his laptop, his life would be significantly happier (okay, not in a week with as many problems as this story presents, but on a less-hectic week it'd help a lot). Beau manages to do a lot of sitting and listening in this book, which isn't very exciting - even with handguns falling out of purses. If that translates into \\"boring\\" for you, then this may not be among your favorite novels.<br />All in all, I liked this book. It had a little bit of everything, with a bit much of only a few things. Even with all the sitting and talking I found it a quick read. Your mileage may vary, but as far as the book's conclusion is concerned, getting there was half the fun.	2004-04-06

Sick Puppy is written with Hiaasen's usual eye for the absurd (Barbie fetishes, lopsided ocelots, misremembered song lyrics), but a lot of the fun seems to be missing. We see a more menacing side of Skink than in past outings, due to being placed between a rock and a hard place by the current gubernatorial administration. A number of villains meet poetically just ends, but the means by which those ends are reached are absent all but a touch of whimsical irony.<br />The pro-environmental slant is a bit ham-fisted. We're presented with a character having essentially the same anti-development dream three times. Our ruthless real estate developers somehow manage to eradicate an island's entire toad population seemingly overnight (logically, this doesn't make sense - and it eliminates great potential humor; imagine the inconvenient places a tiny amphibian could get into - but that's the way the story's written). <br />Hopefully our Skink-lite hero is on his way to learning the ways of true eco-friendliness from the master at the novel's close. His methods throughout the novel are as destructive as those to whom he metes out &quot;justice.&quot; There has to be a better way than bank bombings and trash dumping, not to mention the wanton destruction of luxury cars - and how fuel-efficient and non-pollutionary is the Buick Roadmaster anyway?<br />If you enjoy rubbernecking at the train wreck that is the human condition, this book has plenty of what you're looking for. This isn't Hiaasen's best work, so it doesn't have much more than that, but if you're a fan it's enough.	2004-04-03

I found the characterizations to be well-constructed and -detailed. I found the villain to be utterly convincing as a sociopathic murderess. I liked the fact that Wimsey and Parker weren't always ahead of the curve on everything, and even when they occasionally were they often laid back rather than expose their positions too soon. The chronology at the end was a little wonky, but not too bad. I appreciated that while Miss Climpson had a bit of a \\"deus ex machina\\" moment toward the end, Lord Peter didn't profit from it directly. Bunter's photographic memory was a bit much, but then, that's Bunter for you.<br />The majority of the plot in Unnatural Death is of such a sophisticated nature that it could have as easily been written in this century as in the last. In fact, with today's forensic-medicine/crime-solving thrillers on TV, Mary Whittaker would fit right in as a villain on Crossing Jordan or one of the CSIs or Law &amp; Orders (to the benefit of those programs, as well). About the only thing that wouldn't really fit - without better explanation - is the suspected blackmailing angle (at least I was never sure how that was supposed to work). <br />The entrance of Miss Climpson gives the book moments of coziness in an otherwise technically-oriented investigation. I had previously encountered Miss Climpson in Strong Poison (a later novel), so it was great fun being in on Lord Peter's joke on his brother-in-law when he introduced D.I. Parker to his \\"mystery lady.\\" <br />In addition to tackling issues of race relations, feminism, Catholicism, and the grade of ham enjoyed by the upper classes, Ms. Sayers delves into the topic of euthanasia and the ethics surrounding it. It's not the typical fare found in a mystery, but Sayers is not your typical mystery writer. I enjoy the way she weaves social issues into her novels without becoming preachy; here the debate, while complex, never slows the momentum of the story.<br />This is an extraordinary novel. Wimsey's eccentricities are at a minimum (a helpful biographical note before the story (in the 8th Avon edition, at least) does much to explain some of them) and the plot is really first rate. Of the several Sayers books I've read, this is the one I'd recommend reading first (I haven't read the two earlier mysteries yet, so my mind may yet change); Strong Poison is a good second, but it's probably best to meet Miss Climpson here first before reading the 6th Lord Peter novel.	2004-03-30

I must say I really liked it. (...) Kidd has a more upbeat outlook on life than Davenport, although both share a dry, sardonic wit. Davenport and Kidd also share uncanny instincts and surround themselves with colleagues who excel at what they do - Davenport: police-work; Kidd: crime. Minneapolis-St. Paul only briefly provides a setting for this book, then it's off to sunnier, warmer climes in California and Texas. <br />For the most part Sandford does well in crafting this departure from his normal fare. He slips here and there (Santa Cruz, for instance is on the other side of a mountain range from Silicon Valley), but does a pretty good job of getting most things right. I liked the detail he went into as Kidd and LuEllen went on their heists (whether he got everything right or not, I don't know; it sounded convincing at any rate). The light tone and humor are well balanced, never crossing over into Carl Hiaasen absurdism (I'm not knocking Hiaasen, he pulls off that style exceptionally well). <br />I look forward to reading the other Kidd novels. Several reviewers here have suggested the earlier books are even better than this one. If that's the case they must be very good, indeed, as this book was quite a ride.	2004-03-23
US	50710993	R36T6X9R6W3NVS	0575050039	373452918	'BILL, PLANET OF ROBOT SLAVES'	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Pretty Good Barthroom Humor	Harry Harrison's Bill the Galactic Hero (BtGH) series is the sci-fi equivalent of Robert Aspirin's &quot;Myth&quot; fantasy books: pun-based humor is paramount and the more improbable the plotline the better.<br />This time around BtGH and company find themselves on the Planet of Usa after a nasty Chinger attack on their military base. Robotic lifeforms are the indigenous species on the planet, with two factions endlessly at war with each other. The Chingers have allied themselves with one of the factions (the one with the robot slaves), leaving the humans to ally themselves with the other. Residing on the planet are several humanoid groups, also endlessly at war with each other.<br />If you've picked up on the theme of endless war then this book might not be too subtle for you (if the theme escaped you, you might consider a position as a cadet with the Space Troopers). The machinations of war are severely criticized - and parodied - in the novel. In this respect the book is similar to Joseph Heller's Catch-22 (in much the same way that microwaveable pork rinds are akin to a Honeybaked ham), but because so little of the storyline can be taken seriously Harrison's commentary is easily dismissed if you happen to disagree with it.<br />The first BtGH book was divided into three major sections. Here the story takes place in half a dozen or so set pieces, each having very little to do with each other (beyond taking place on the Planet of the Robot Slaves). Some of them are funny (The Roman Legion vs. King Arthur), some of them are not (the PLDP).<br />Take away the comedy and there's not a lot to recommend this book. I happen to find character names like Cy BerPunk (computer technician) and Mel Praktis (doctor) mildly amusing - plus my father, brother and a nephew are each named Bill (only the nephew has true Galactic Hero potential), so it's fun to tweak them about their namesake. If these things don't hold true for you, you might want to consider reading a different book.	2004-03-16

Many of Sayers' plot devices have become routine, if not clichéd, so it's little wonder modern readers leap to conclusions ahead of Lord Peter Wimsey.<br />The plot revolves around a rural community in England and certain misdeeds past and present. Central to the community is its church, and it is here that Lord Peter spends most of his time, either in the Rectory, the cemetery, or the church building itself. <br />The story is told through the metaphor of &quot;change ringing.&quot; If you know nothing of this English tradition it is possible to soldier through - the text does provide some clues - but it's rough going. A website with some particularly helpful information is [...] An online Java application that enables you to ring your own bells is [...] Googling for &quot;change ringing&quot; will provide additional examples, but these two cover many of the points Sayers includes in the novel.<br />While the mystery is not the most challenging (outside of a cryptogram, which is almost as unsolvable as the code in Have His Carcase), this is still an extremely good novel. Sayers' small church characters are written spot on, and her inclusion of church and governmental politics feels authentic. Other Lord Peter novels have held up better over time; that this one hasn't serves as a testimony to the effect Dorothy Sayers has had on the mystery writers that came after her. I enjoyed this book and heartily recommend it with the minor caveats listed above.	2004-03-10

Then I was surprised how much I was enjoying it anyway.<br />Certainly there are elements of horror: The Rake, The Hag, The Magdalene and her Offspring, and The Scourge/Uriel - but this is primarily a love story between Cal and Suzanna. Their relationship is remarkable if for no other reason than the fact that it can never be fully consummated (unlike most of the casual relationships Cal and Suzanna have with others, which can and often are).<br />From suburban London to the Scottish Highlands to the Arabian desert, the story covers all this ground, plus the fantastic settings within the weave (The Fugue) itself. The pacing is fairly quick, but Barker does take the time to insert a descriptive paragraph or nice turn of phrase now and then. Characters are well-drawn, but there isn't a whole lot of development demonstrated over the course of the novel. Cal becomes obsessed with the carpet, but doesn't really change as he pursues or attains it. Suzanna gets super-powers almost as soon as she comes on the scene, so there isn't even much &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; as she comes to grips with them.<br />The book has a few other flaws, as well. Barker consistently uses the crassest term imaginable for the part of female anatomy euphemistically referred to on the TV-show Scrubs as the &quot;bajingo.&quot; There are some pretty big plot holes as well; for instance, at one point a psychic attack is accidentally launched against an innocent London population; later, when such an attack would come in handy, no one suggests &quot;doing what we did back in London.&quot; Wasn't it Chekov who said, &quot;If you establish mind-altering super-powers in the beginning of the book you have to make an attempt to use them in a crucial moment by the end of the book&quot;? Words to that effect, at any rate.<br />Subject matter and material aside, this is still a very good fantasy story. Romance fans will find a lot to recommend it. Horror fans may find themselves pleasantly surprised.	2004-03-03

He gave an excellent presentation, and because he writes like he speaks this is a very good book.<br />Unfortunately, what keeps it from being a great book is that it was written in the early 90s. It needs a Second Edition to look at what went wrong in the dot-com era, for instance, and whether more (or less) corporate evangelism could have made a difference. It also needs to analyze the Mac Product Introduction Plan and address what went wrong (or at least acknowledge that the document had some flaws in predicting the outcome of the Apple-IBM war). Some Twenty-First Century examples of how corporate evangelism still works would be helpful, too.<br />The book has a very light tone. If you're a fan of the Dilbert (anti)management books, you'll appreciate Kawasaki's approach. Occasionally the anti-IBM bias strikes the wrong chord (especially since very few of the jibes are directed at Bill Gates and Microsoft). Apple takes its lumps too, mainly in the area of their corportate structuring.<br />Coming from 1991's perspective, the examples in the book are showing their age. Should a new edition be published, including the suggestions noted above, expect it to be a four- or five-star book. As it is, it's a nice, relatively-inexpensive read that demonstrates there's still hope for the Davids of the world to overcome their own personal Goliaths.	2004-03-03

I found the crime believable (frighteningly so), the pacing brisk but not rushed, and the interaction between Brady and Beaumont realistic. I was startled by their \\"moment\\" together, but have come to the conclusion that it was more out of character for Beaumont to reject it than for Brady to instigate it (she wasn't connecting well with Butch and found herself with a man she has expended a lot of emotional energy against; a man who, like her, had lost a spouse; a man who understood and appreciated her law-enforcement skills - add to that the fact she had been put through the wringer by Ken Junior and Marliss Shackleford, lost Sadie, and hadn't been eating properly and you've got a recipe for disaster).<br />SPOILER WARNING:<br />I was less thrilled with the behavior of the murderer in his attempt to flee justice. If the APB goes out for a man with gray hair and a long ponytail ... well that's nothing that a pair of scissors and a bottle of Grecian Formula can't fix. Why go to all the trouble he did when much simpler solutions existed. A few threads were left hanging at the end of the book, too: What did Ernie find at the post office, who saw the \\"moment\\" and what did they do about it, did Naomi Pepper grow a pair or is her mom really going to come between her and Beau - inquiring minds want to know.<br />Ultimately, this is a story of survivors. Sure, not everyone survives (it's not much of a murder mystery if everyone makes it through okay), but Jance focuses more attention on those that do than she has recently. Cornelia Lester's story is particularly tragic, Serenity Granger's almost humorous. The Andy Brady and Anne Corley deaths are given more attention here than they have been in recent Jance books, most likely to give helpful back-story to readers who read one of her series but not the other.<br />If you've never read any of Jance's novels, Partner in Crime does a good job of introducing you to both her crimefighters at once. It does spoil the ending of the first J.P. Beaumont novel (and the first Joanna Brady novel to a lesser degree), so if that's something you want to avoid, read those books first.

This plot device would be perfected decades later when Peter Brady simultaneously kept dates with two girls, but Ms. Sayers acquits herself admirably in this novel.<br />An author who frequently made her novels deliver more than just a solid whodunit, Sayers gives the reader a fly-on-the-wall view of an advertising agency in this book. Having worked on the production side of several publications I can verify that her descriptions are spot on. Sayers also includes a couple editorial asides (in the guise of internal soliloquies) about rampant consumerism and middle-class aspirations to luxury and first class footwear. They're as true today as they were in 1930's (and probably the 17- and 1830's as well). And if you hated the idea of The Beatles' music being used to hawk cars, you can imagine how consumers of a previous age felt to see the works of Shakespeare or Tennyson used to promote nerve powder. This is all to say that this novel's verisimilitude has weathered the years exceedingly well.<br />The central mystery - who slew Victor Dean - gets lost occasionally in the goings-on at the ad agency, but Wimsey, er Bredon, er whoever, is always at work, picking up the odd clue here and there as he goes. Even when the depth of the crime grows - to multiple murders and drug trafficking - Sayers keeps bringing it back to Dean's murder. By the end of the cricket match I found myself floored that I almost understood the game, but also by the way Sayers expertly wove in two crucial revelations about the mystery.<br />I was satisfied with the story's conclusion. At first the ending seemed cold-blooded and -hearted, but upon reflection I realized that the resolution was well forshadowed - if Wimsey's middle name were Steve it'd be another matter, perhaps. Although we'd spent most of the book with the impish, playful sideof Lord Peter, there's another side to his character which values honor most and is not above going beyond the law to preserve it.<br />If you're not a Dorothy Sayers fan you should probably get to know her detective in an earlier work like Strong Poison first. Then, once you're comfortable with his character, give this novel a read. If you are a Sayers fan, why aren't you reading this book already? 9 out of 10 readers agree, this is a five-star mystery.	2004-02-17
US	50710993	RUYEHTQB43SLU	0061098795	657088689	The Wailing Wind	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Short Winded	I didn't care too much for this book, it just didn't meet my expectations. Some reviewers have likened the lightweight storyline to the Hardy Boys; I suggest that Jessica Fletcher could be substituted for Leaphorn or Chee, and a quirky sidekick for Manuelito, and you've got a Southwestern Murder, She Wrote. <br />First off, the book is very short; initially I thought I had picked up a large-print edition - the type is so big - but the Amazon summary matches the ISBN. If more time and space had been devoted to telling this story, all these problems could have been eliminated easily.<br />Second, because it's so short character development takes place in quantum leaps. For instance, Officer Manuelito considers a career change, commenting that her mother says \\"there's just too much evil in this business ... too much sorrow.\\" Nice sentiments, certainly, but it overlooks the fact that a) only Manuelito's awareness of the evil/sorrow has changed, not that there's any more of it in society than there has ever been (and, indeed, most of the evil and sorrow in this book has been waiting decades to be discovered); and b) her reaction to this awareness is to run from it, which only gives evil and sorrow that much more power over the innocent. Granted, people don't always behave logically, but this smacks of Hillerman having developed a relationship into a corner and needing to take drastic measures to get out of it quickly. <br />Third, the folklore and myth in this book is trivial. The \\"Wailing Wind\\" or \\"la Llorana\\" connection is more in line with a belagaana ghost story (it even takes place at Halloween); the final Zuñi anecdote was pretty much just a punch line. The myths and legends in Hillerman's books usually provide color and metaphor for the events in the book. Here they don't, and that's unfortunate.<br />Fourth, with so much of the story being told in flashbacks, Hillerman has some pretty clumsy segues. You can almost see the page go all wavy and hear harp music inthe background. The broad details of the past would have been better dealt with in a prologue (a court scene would have worked well), with specifics and discrepancies coming out in the body of the work.<br />This is not to say that there's nothing to like in the book. The first half in particular is handled very well. I especially liked how Chee and Manuelito carried out independent investigations to discover the location of a murder scene. He used U.S. Forest Service data, she used botanical knowledge, both arrived at the same conclusion - that's nice detective work. I also liked the new FBI agent; despite his handicaps of not knowing the language and having the tribal police working against him as much as with him, he did do a good job of arresting the right people. The suggestion that the Chee/Manuelito angst may soon be coming to an end is a welcome development (if only Leaphorn and Bourbonette would finalize things, too).<br />It's not that The Wailing Wind is a bad book, but it is pretty mediocre. It's like the fast-food \\"chipotle\\" craze - you get a sense of the Southwestern flavor you want, but excellence has been sacrificed for expedience. Go ahead and read the book; it's okay, but don't expect it to fully satisfy your appetite.	2004-02-10

The earlier mystery placed Harriet Vane in jeopardy should Lord Peter prove unable to exonerate her. In this book there is no such risk-factor, consequently the story is little more than a mental exercise regimen for two not-so-old, not-so-dear friends (although they do get quite a bit better acquainted on this outing). The book is also a few chapters too long (or short, depending on your point of view); \\"the evidence of the mannequin,\\" for instance, made only a minor contribution to the denouement and could have been eliminated - or it could have been better capitalized upon and drawn in several of the women characters as suspects. The murder plot is definitely overcomplicated and would likely never occur in real life ... unless you wanted to commit a murder that would baffle the police and almost thwart Wimsey and Vane as well (in which case it's *exactly* what you'd do).<br /><br />For its several shortcomings, \\"Carcase\\" is still a very enjoyable read. The verbal sparring between Wimsey and Vane is priceless. Vane's perspective as a mystery novelist adds a bit of behind-the-scenes color. The local police force occasionally comes off a bit too indulgent of the amateur investigators, but it was very nice that they were portrayed as neither blustering know-it-alls nor no-nothing bumpkins. Bunter's quest through London involves some of the best written pacing I've ever read.<br /><br />A couple final points: The word \\"carcase\\" in the title would nowadays be written as \\"carcass.\\" Before reading the book I thought it had something to do with those large trunks that used to get strapped onto the back of cars. The title actually refers to the fact that before a murder investigation can go forward, the police need to have the body (or its remains) at hand. Point two: Don't read \\"the evidence of the cipher\\" (Chapter 28) when you are tired; while it provides a very good look at a cryptographer's work, it carries with it the potential risk of causing your head to explode. Be careful, you really wouldn't want that to happen. Trust me.at a cryptographer's work, it carries with it the potential risk of causing your head to explode.

Jance manages to do several things very well:  she establishes likeable primary and secondary characters ( ... and then there's Maude, er, Eleanor, Joanna Brady's mother, who's well-established and *dis*likeable); she makes a bold departure (both geographically and tonally) from the J.P.

A few things aren't quite Grade-A, however: the plot itself is lightweight and Joanna has a tendency to ramble in her dialogue.<br />Although this is the first in the series, if you've read other Joanna Brady books first, go ahead and read this one too. The pace moves quickly and it's always good to read a character's origins firsthand. <br />While the bar - to a certain degree - is set low, the novel certainly doesn't disappoint.

Fortunately, The Return of the King is as good as or better than its companion books.<br />The book opens (unlike the also excellent Peter Jackson movie) with Pippin and Gandalf riding to Minas Tirith, Aragorn &amp; Co. In Rohan pondering their next move, and Sam trying to rescue Frodo from the orcs of Cirith Ungol - granted, you don't pick up this final thread until over halfway through the main text (a synchronized version of events appears in Appendix B). If your only interest is in seeing the Ring destroyed, skip directly to Chapter 3 of Book VI. If you can stand some \\"irrelevant information and/or dialogue,\\" go ahead and read Book V and see if Gondor can be saved from Sauron's minions.<br />Don't stop reading at the end of the main text, though. The Appendices contain a wealth of information including the history, calendars, and languages of Middle-Earth. While not required reading, they really add to one's appreciation of Tolkien's masterpiece.	2004-01-26

Now, while I'm no kung-fu master, I have been able to design a simple set of webpages for my church using the techniques described in this book, and will soon retrofit some older HTML-only sites.<br />I like this book's approach of starting with simple projects and then developing more complex ones as the things progress. Chapters usually begin with simple (frequently deprecated) HTML coding techniques and then show a better way to gain control of a document with XHTML and style sheets. Thankfully, Castro points out that the deprecated tags are not only admissible with Transitional XHTML, they frequently provide a quick (albeit dirty) solution to your coding needs - if your page needs only one instance of a <font> tag, go for it, don't overcomplicate your style sheet unneccesarily. I very much like the style sheet projects; they really bring into focus their power and potential (my previous CSS experience had been more textbook-oriented, so these were eye-openers.)<br />This is not to say there aren't problems with the book. Frequently Castro begins describing a handy element or attribute only to conclude the section with: \\"no browser currently supports this.\\" If all of these had been grouped into an appendix called \\"An Eye to the Future\\" I'd have no complaint, but to build up these vapor features in the main text was frustrating, if not cruel. Also, I feel the \\"Formatting: The Old Way\\" and \\"Layout: The Old Way\\" would have worked better at the beginning of the book rather than the end, simply because if you're relatively new to HTML it would give you a better understanding of what is discussed later when Castro presents the New/Better/Right way. The book has a basic one-page-per-idea format, which works about 80% of the time: 10% of the time the topic should have been expanded to two or three pages (and *occasionally* things are); 10% of the time things have been obviously padded. Finally, at the end of the introduction, a Q&A forum is mentioned, but the URL provided is dead; at first I was disappointed since I looked forward to the possibility of peer assistance, but I later found that it had been moved to the \\"Help\\" section of the site (hopefully the defunct URL will be redirected, but if not, that's where the forum is).<br />This book is not for everyone: novices may be overwhelmed; more experienced developers may be bored. It's a fairly good introduction for the intermediate user, which made it great for me. Take advantage of the sample pages here at Amazon to get a feel for whether it's for you or not. If the excerpts make sense to you, but don't induce coma, you're a good candidate for getting a lot out of this book.	2004-01-17

Most of the photographs do a good job of conveying the theme, but a few fall short, and only one or two actually show \\"towns\\" as opposed to simply abandoned or ruined buildings.<br />A few highlights:<br />MARCH: The Aldridge Sawmill (Angelina Nat'l Forest, Tex.) - A very spooky, almost sinister image. The roof and interior structure of the mill are gone and the picture is of the far wall taken through the crumbling remains of the near wall. Trees grow inside the mill, and can be seen towering over the far wall as well. It's as if the trees have had their revenge on the place.<br />JUNE: Mariscal Mines (Big Bend Nat'l Park, Tex.) - The ruins of several clay brick and flat stone structures are surrounded by cacti and scrub-brush. Imposing cliffs loom in the distance. A very forlorn scene.<br />JULY: Bodie State Historic Park (Calif.) - Two ancient gas pumps dominate the picture, with wood and corrugated metal structures scattered in the background. Some of the corrugated metal looks new, but still the scene is none to welcoming.<br />AUGUST: Elizabethtown (N.M.) - Crumbling stone walls and a chimney are all that remain of this structure now overgrown with desert grass. You can almost hear the wind whistling through the gaping window and door frames.<br />NOVEMBER: Terlingua (Tex.) - The names are almost completely worn off these two weather-beaten crosses atop their piles of graveyard stones. The image is marred by smoke in the foreground and what look like telephone poles in the distance (maybe they're former telegraph poles, that'd be more appropriate). Still, it's spooky.<br />DECEMBER: Old Hatchita (N.M.) - A string of Christmas lights gives an adobe ruins a festive touch. A good choice for the holiday season.<br />The individual boxes of the calendar grid are large and the dates are bold and clear to read. Plenty of holidays are listed from several countries and traditions. Moon phases are hard to read: they're small and printed in a mango color - if I had purchased the calendar for the phases of the moon, I'd be very disappointed (and weird).<br />All in all, I like this calendar. I'm sure in time the pictures I like least will grow on me. That's what I like about this kind of calendar; while the images are kind of sad, kind of spooky, and occasionally sinister in nature, it's nice that places like these still exist, to take your imagination back to times and places that used to be. The more time I spend back there, the more I tend like it. Perhaps you'd like it, too.	2004-01-16

The illustrations are enjoyable, if a bit gross. The storyline feels a lot like something that Pugsley and Wednesday Addams would do. The mischief that Morty and Ray get into is appropriate for 1st through 4th graders - if your kids are going to do it anyway, you might as well impress upon them the effect poor behavior has on one's character early. The moral of the story is left for parents to impart as needed, or for the reader to infer on his or her own. <br />I bought this as a gift for a friend's son, a 1st grader, and he really enjoyed it. I will probably buy another to add to my son's library in a few years - I may buy it now and just enjoy it myself until he gets old enough to appreciate it.	2004-01-13

A number of reviewers have taken the author to task for the book's shortcomings. Lighten up! It's a fun book about a fun topic. Don't be so serious, you'll get an ulcer.<br />First off, the book is subtitled: The Fan's Guide to the Golden Age of Video Games. As a \\"fan's guide\\" it works well - it's less a doctoral thesis in the field of Arcadeology than a simple overview of games the casual 1980s arcade visitor would know and likely love. If you want obscure references and arcane knowledge, this is definitely not your book.<br />Second, whenever I get together with my brother and sisters I revert to the maturity of a late teenager (my wife hates this). It seems that Sellers has reverted to that same level of maturity in his commentary, and probably for the same reason: It's fun to go back in time and try and relive our favorite moments. Cut the guy a break and get in on the fun. If you can read the word \\"poopy\\" without grinning, you're not ready for this book. If the Beavis and Butthead voice in your head says \\"he wrote `poopy'...cool...heh heh eh heh,\\" you're ready to dive right in. <br />Third, I like the year-by-year history snippets. It provides a context for what else we were doing when not playing the games. Was it necessary? No. Does \\"Who Shot J.R.?\\" have anything to do with video games? No. Does it help get you back in the mindset of The Golden Age? I think so.<br />Fourth, I like the mix of games in the book. There are games you loved, liked, and hated. There are the popular games and the sleepers. Are one or more of your favorites neglected? Probably (I'd have liked a page for Tailgunner or Omega Race, myself). I wish Sellers hadn't ragged on Bosconian (but I was an English major, so that's probably why I like it so much). I liked Cliff Hanger more than Dragon's Lair, but I can concede that DL deserves the full review, CH the snippet.<br />Finally, the sole purpose of a book like this is to kindle the feeling of nostalgia in its reader. I had forgotten some of the things in the book: some of the games, some of the trends - I had totally forgotten about putting quarters up on marquee lip to reserve the next game. I feel better for having remembered them. If you were born in the late-'60s/early-'70s, no longer live in your parents' basement, and enjoy a fun, light read, you'll probably like this book too.	2004-01-03
US	50710993	R103UFDA4T23U	0446679208	319472554	The Children of Men	Books	2	40	51	N	N	No Emotion, Please. We're British.	The premise of this novel is intriguing. Unfortunately, the intrigue ends there and is replaced with a drab portrayal of a depressing future.<br />The greatest problem is I have with this book is the detachment with which the year 2021 is explored. Objective perspective may work well in a detective novel, but in The Children of Men, James' prose is affected by the same ennui that has overtaken her Twenty-First Century world. In the opening chapters, for instance, there is a scene where one woman brutally destroys the porcelain doll another woman has been treating as a baby. The initial moment of violence is shocking, but beyond that the scene lacks emotional impact: We see the people around her react by not reacting, simply continuing on with their lives. Unfortunately, the ultimate result of James' technique is that we don't care if England is living under a totalitarian regime because none of her citizens, her protagonist chief among them, seems to care either. <br />Another problem comes from the fact that nothing exists in 2021 that didn't exist in 1992 when the book was written, and for the most part little that existed in the 1980s is present either: no computers, no cell phones, etc. If James took little risk in exploring the emotional depths of her characters, she took even less in exploring the potential for the use (or misuse) of hypothetical future technology. Cloning, an obvious solution for the book's dilemma, is never even mentioned. Why set the book in the future if everything about it is identical to the past? Sure, things won't come to pass exactly as you imagine, but 1995 came and went without global infertility and that's the element people enjoy most about the book.<br />Finally, the novel fails to look at the situation in England, which we are told - but never shown - is despotic, by comparing it to the situation in any other European country. At the end of Book 1 Faron travels to France, Spain and Italy, but we're never told if or how things fare better or worse there. His travels serve only to provide a reason for the time gap between Books 1 and 2. James misses an opportunity to provide a context for or comment on the political situation in England, and all the reader can do is shrug his or her shoulders and keep reading (the ennui is contagious).<br />Maybe there's a subtext I'm missing - maybe James is saying that people can numb themselves into accepting totalitarianism, or that nothing really changes, or that life's the same all over - but if she is she's doing it far too subtly for most of her readership (based on the majority of reviews here). I don't regret reading this book, but I can't find much in it to recommend to others.	2004-01-02

Sound out the words as you go. Look up long or difficult words in the dictionary. Spanking is advocated in limited situations and at limited times and never as an angry response from a parent. Other methods of discipline are advocated in most cases, but to purposefully leave this tool out of your parenting toolbox - or to keep it there, but not know how to use it effectively - can spell disaster if you are ever in need of using it.      This book has been influential in helping me think about how to raise my son. The best wisdom Dobson imparts is that a child must feel loved and secure in his or her home before any kind of discipline will be effective. I have seen marked improvement in my son's response to discipline since I have begun spending more one-on-one time with him doing the things he enjoys, rather than just the things I want him to do.       As much as I liked the first half dozen chapters, I found the &quot;Discipline in Learning&quot; section less useful. Perhaps once my son begins grade school they'll be helpful, but for now it seems like it's just information to tuck away until later.      Dobson really lost me, however, in Chapter Ten: Discipline in Morality. The chapter should really be entitled &quot;Discipline in Abstinence,&quot; because premarital sex is the only aspect of immorality discussed therein. It could also be entitled &quot;I Hate Planned Parenthood, Teddy Kennedy and the Makers of Trojan-Brand Prophylactics, and by the way, STDs and AIDS Can Kill You or at Least Mess up Your Life,&quot; because that's really all the information you'll come away with after reading this chapter. Dobson comes down against classroom sex education, and while he suggests you provide age-appropriate information to your children, he never suggests what specifically - or even generally - that should be. As with the section on classroom learning, maybe this information will come in handy later, but the vitriolic writing style and advice-free content come as such a complete departure from the first nine chapters that I wonder.      All in all, a good book, that unfortunately gets a bit shaky toward the end. Parents of young children will get the most out of the first six and eleventh chapters. Parents with school-age children will likely get a lot out of chapters seven through nine, as well. Chapter Ten is problematic, make of it what you will. There is also an appendix that focuses on drug use that is big-on-data/low-on-advice similar to Chapter Ten, minus the biliousness.	2003-12-30

Clara Rinker's rape was certainly traumatic, but to go from her vengeance with a T-ball bat to \\"That's how Rinker became a hit lady\\" is a bit simplistic. Likewise, for Carmel Loan to go from a lawyer who hires a hit lady to a sadistic power-tool user pushes the limits of credulity. There are other ways Sandford could have taken the reader from Point A to B and the book suffers for their absence.<br />The second strike has to do with the omnipresent Reality Commission Report B-story. Deputy Chief Lucas Davenport is annoyed and bored by the Commission, so it doesn't sustain the reader's interest. The report drags down the story whenever it's mentioned because the reader finds it as boring as Davenport does. The eventual payoff doesn't compensate for the prolonged tedium throughout the novel.<br />The reliance on coincidence and the seeming assurance that clues will be found if Davenport &amp; Co. look inventively enough is annoying, but not out of character for the Prey series. Davenport is often described as being unnaturally lucky, but the distance his luck stretches in this book tests the reader's patience.<br />Where the book does work, however, is in Sandford's portrayal of Davenport and his team, as well as his ability to convey image and characterization with his nonchalant yet concise prose. The story steamrollers on, in spite of the aforementioned distractions. While you may not be able to suspend your disbelief fully, you still want to see where the book is going. The fact that you travel throughout the Midwest and Washington, DC (and stop briefly in the Pacific Northwest) only to wind up nowhere at the end of the book demonstrates how frustrating this book is.<br />An interesting book, to be sure. A potboiler, no doubt. But the book just isn't satisfying. Go ahead and read it - if for no other reason than to fully appreciate thesecond (and better) Rinker book, Mortal Prey - but don't set your expectations too high; this book doesn't deliver.	2003-12-29

The latest interview was published in early 1989, while King was still working on The Dark Half.       There's a lot of ground covered here, but not all coverage is even. For instance, Stanley Kubrick's film version of The Shining is discussed frequently, first with King discussing how excited he is about the project (pre-release) and then how disappointed he was after the movie came out. King's own directorial project, Maximum Overdrive, gets similar coverage, as does his work as screenwriter for Creepshow. Some of King's work is strangely missing, though: The film Firestarter is discussed much more than the novel; The Dark Tower books (The Gunslinger and The Drawing of the Three) and The Talisman are mentioned only in passing. An article in Time Magazine where King is referred to as &quot;the master of post-literate prose&quot; is mentioned several times, but the article itself is absent.       The interviews are divided up into nine chapters (plus epilogue), covering his start, early years, &quot;Going Hollywood,&quot; recent (late '80s) years, etc. Copyright details for each piece appear at the beginning of the book, but I think it would have been more helpful if they had appeared prior to each interview along with a brief bio of the interviewer (as many interject their own opinions and memories into the interviews and it would be nice to know who these people are).      King is portrayed in fairly glowing terms throughout Feast of Fear; a much franker version of this period of his life - including alcoholism and drug addiction - appears in King's autobiographical memoir, On Writing. Is King entirely truthful in his interview responses? No, but he is insightful - King admits in On Writing that he made up his stock response of writing everyday except for Christmas, the Fourth of July and his birthday, because you have to say *something* and it shouldat least be half clever. Nevertheless, even if Stephen King the brand-name-and-legend isn't the real deal, the man reflected in these pages is still a heck of an interesting guy with a lot to say about the creative process and celebrity.	2003-12-23

You can always take it up and find something entertaining.\\" The same could be said of this slim book of twelve short stories. <br />It took me a couple stories to realize that there was no point attempting to solve the crimes as I read them: essential clues are not detailed until the denouement or it is left to Wimsey's vast intellect or Egg's street-smarts to arrive at the correct conclusion. These are simply short stories that are a joy to read because they are well-written and deal with interesting crimes, as well as plots that are as carefully crafted as Sayers' amateur detectives with their commitment to seeing justice prevail.<br />If you are unfamiliar with Sayers' longer fiction, this is a good place to make her acquaintance. These stories provide good examples of her wit and technique, and with no story longer than a couple dozen pages (and most quite a bit shorter than that) you can enjoy a story whenever you find yourself with a few minutes to spare.	2003-12-22

Jance manages to keep things moving at a fast clip and provide a mystery that is as multi-faceted as her lead character's personal difficulties. Beau has a lot to deal with in this book: a daughter who starts out a missing person and winds up pregnant and about to be married, a re-married ex-wife and her husband, a new girlfriend, a murder suspect that awakens painful memories, the siren song of a bottle of MacNaughton's, and a couple police officers out to nail his hide to a wall - not to mention the book's three murder victims or the loved one Beau loses in the course of the investigation.<br />There are a few nits that could be picked (Oregon vanity plates don't have 8 letters, for instance), but the quality of the rest of the book more than compensates. All in all, a great read.	2003-12-22

Sayers presents what is essentially an epistolary novel with this book. Ostensibly a collection of 40-some letters and 2 long written statements, the book details the events leading up to the murder of George Harrison (not *that* George Harrison), and the efforts of the victim's son and a reluctant ally to get to the truth of matter.<br />While it's not exactly Rashomon, unreliable narrators abound, and fixing just what's what as letters contradict each other is the reader's challenge in the first half of the book. In the second half, Paul Harrison details his efforts to find his father's killer and pulls in budding author John Munting to assist him. Their investigation proceeds in fits and starts until it hits the brick wall of knowing *who* committed the murder, and even *why* and *how*, but not being able to prove any of it. As the number of pages dwindles, you begin to doubt if Sayers can get out of the corner she's painted herself into. Without answering whether she does or not, I will say the ending doesn't disappoint.<br />One suspects that Sayers' late-1920's audience got more out of this novel than today's readers. Unless you're well versed in D.H. Lawrence, R.U.R., and other then-current artistic works, you - like me - will miss what I suspect are some rather satirical asides. Nonetheless, this remains a highly enjoyable book by one of England's best mystery writers. (Robert Eustace, Sayers' co-author, is the pseudonym of Dr. Eustace Robert Barton, who likely provided her with much of the scientific material for the story; he also collaborated with several other mystery writers in the first third of the 20th Century.)	2003-12-13
US	50710993	R353BBVI61DJC2	0425192725	249229548	"Q" is for Quarry (A Kinsey Millhone Mystery, Book 17)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A Break from Formula	Sue Grafton's \\"Q is for Quarry\\" is a break from the usual pattern for a Kinsey Millhone (KM) novel. Usually Kinsey takes a case, finds out her client isn't who she thought they were, gets into squabbles with the police, comes upon the solution to the case, confronts her suspect alone (instead of having the police do it), tables get turned, she finds herself in grave danger, barely survives it, and closes the book with a Dragnet-esque epilogue. This book is slightly different as her client is the police, so \\"squabbles with the police\\" above should read \\"squabbles with her client.\\"<br />Actually, there are quite a few departures from the typical KM story. Very little action takes place in Santa Teresa (the Santa Barbara of Grafton's fictionalized Southern California). Instead, the reader is treated to exotic locales like Lompoc and Blythe (real cities, and the reader would do well to follow the action with a AAA map). Kinsey's family makes another appearance, with another layer of onion skin being removed (if you like her family you probably enjoy the revelation of each new layer; if you don't care for them you probably wish Grafton would take a more \\"yank the band-aid off\\" approach instead of this delicate approach). It seems to me that Kinsey was missing a lot of her spark; given the number of people who lie to her, she remains oddly calm throughout the story (she doesn't even make a sarcastic aside about what the \\"Oceanview Motel\\" is doing in the middle of the desert). The story opens with her 37th birthday a calendar-page away, so maybe she's mellowing; the kinder, gentler Millhone isn't necessarily a bad thing, but like a lot in this book, it just feels different - a number of her quirks feel like they're thrown in just to remind us that this is a KM novel (her trademark \\"nail-scissors hair-trim\\" doesn't appear until the final chapters of the book).<br />The mystery itself is based on a real-life Jane Doe murder, another departure from the usual fare. By no means, though,  is this a true-crime story; other than the location and general condition of the corpse, there is very little similarity between Grafton's book and any current police investigation. A concluding Author's Note details Grafton's involvement in reviving the actual cold case and includes a facial reconstruction of the victim. The website [...] still (end of 2003) features a link to contact them if you have any information on the real Jane Doe, but there is no information detailing any recent developments.<br />Overall, I enjoyed this book; it's not without flaw and it is a considerable departure from the norm. If you approach it expecting things to be a little different, you'll probably like it too. If you want a novel conforming to the standard formula, this book may not be among your favorite KM stories.	2003-12-09

When I saw this desk calendar, however, I bought it right away - I didn't want to take a chance on it selling out before I got around to buying it.<br />Once home, I couldn't wait until January to open it and check it out. The individual pages aren't bound together, so I've set the December pages to the front. Having played with it for a few days I'm not at all disappointed in having spent more money than usual for my desk calendar. <br />Each large, colorful sheet has the outline of a tangram puzzle and it's your job to figure out how to put the pieces (different sized triangles, a parallelogram, and a square) in place. A sturdy magnetic sheet is provided; keep it several sheets behind the current page so the magnetic tangram pieces stick. The answer to each day's puzzle appears on the next day's sheet. Saturday and Sunday share a single puzzle that requires two sets of tangram pieces to complete (half the puzzle is shaded so you can solve half the puzzle, then reuse the pieces for the other half). The puzzles don't repeat, so every day is a new challenge (the obvious solution usually doesn't work).<br />This calendar is larger than most and is not designed for wall mounting. The supporting frame is not as sturdy as I'd like; a minor inconvenience easily fixed with a piece of double-stick tape.<br />Don't wait and miss out. If you're a puzzle fan get this desk calendar today.	2003-12-03

For a third of the price of a case of Huggies from Costco, you can get rid of diapers forever.    I used this book's method to potty-train my son three months ago. We spent from 9am to 2pm following the procedures outlined in the book, but he really had it down by noon. He had four accidents in the first week and a half, and none since. If I had been mindful of how long it had been since he last went to the bathroom, a couple of those accidents could have been avoided, but making the switch from changing diapers after the fact to a more proactive approach can take parents a little while too. I was concerned about putting him in Pull-Ups at bedtime, thinking they might feel enough like diapers that he'd revert to pre-training days, but it hasn't been a problem.     This book was written in the 1970's - those troubling times when moms were homemakers instead of fighter-pilots - and the text reflects the sensibilities of the era. The book also makes the suggestion that if bread-winning dad isn't on board with the process that *he* take over the diaper-changing responsibilities and see how quickly he changes his mind. The gender stratification of the day is obvious, but as a dad who trained his son (and *not* as a penalty for not being with the program) I didn't find the cultural anachronisms too off-putting or annoying. The book was written with a very academic tone - not surprising, considering the university research backgrounds of the authors - so it's not a quick and easy read. Because it is primarily a research document, rewriting it to reflect modern sensibilities really wouldn't enhance it.    One caveat: The book is written for training children with well-developed cognitive abilities and motor skills (the book recommends about 2-1/2 for girls, 3 for boys). If you need to train your child at a younger age, this book may not work for you - because children develop at different rates, the book gives has a readiness test to help you evaluate if your child has the skills necessary to successfully complete the training.    When your child is ready for potty-training, start with this book's method. If you provide the recommended followthrough this will likely be the last book on the subject you'll ever need.	2003-12-02

That's the way the plot ought to work out.\\"<br />This novel features Navajo Tribal Police Lt. Joe Leaphorn and Officer Jim Chee conducting independent parallel investigations into the murder of a fellow officer. This approach to storytelling fails to satisfy as each investigator comes across the same clues through different avenues, dragging the pace of the story down to a crawl. It also means that neither policeman can be very intuitive because they'd get too far ahead of the other (resulting in obvious detective work being overlooked, much to the reader's frustration). Many reviewers here have commented on the nature of the ending; the plot resolution, while not rainbows-and-unicorns is not nearly as tragic as it has been made out to be. The true tragedy is that Hillerman has spent so much time having his heroes cover the same ground again and again, that he resorts to an ending straight out of an episode of Perry Mason (perhaps the quote above was meant to be ironic, instead of simply coincidental).<br />The book, however, does advance the lives and loves of its main characters, and in this respect it works best. Ultimately, this is a decent Leaphorn and Chee story, but not quite the mystery you may have hoped for.	2003-12-01
US	50710993	R3UVG151X364KT	0399140093	596059317	Mind Prey	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Literary Crack	I started reading Mind Prey last night. I finished today, ignoring family, friends, chores, hygiene, etc., in the process. If drugs are like this, I can see the attraction (I'm not advocating anyone test that theory, just get the next Davenport book and tune out the rest of the world for another day).<br />This book, Sandford's seventh \\"Prey\\" mystery, deals with a psycho kidnapper and the games he plays (mental and otherwise) with Deputy Chief Lucas Davenport. If it were just the two of them in the battle of wits, the bad guy might have had a chance, but late in the game he recognizes that Davenport has more than just his uncanny intuition going for him: his crew is top-notch and he has some sharp women on his side, like Elle \\"Sister Mary Joseph\\" Kruger, Weather Karkinnen, and a newcomer known only as \\"Ice.\\"<br />The violence is not for the faint of heart or stomach and the language is frequently harsh (we do learn the difference, however, between profanity, obscenity and vulgarity, so the book is at least educational in that respect). In the context of the story it all makes sense and doesn't sink into exploitation, but if it's not your cup of tea (or martini glass of, well, martini) it will likely detract from the story too much for you to enjoy it. <br />Sandford's imagery draws you into the story and keeps you there. The only times the book begins to drag are during long paragraphs of scene description (the train yard especially gets bogged down...and just when the race against time is at its peak). Thankfully this is kept to a minimum and - once we know where we are - the pace picks right back up again.<br />A fast-paced thriller that is sure to please Sandford's fans, and earn him some new ones, even as it raises the question: \\"Why do the psychos like the Cities so much?\\"	2003-11-23
US	50710993	RC2MCME9GPJYS	0345430573	151155247	A Certain Justice (Adam Dalgliesh Mysteries)	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Overly complicated, with little payoff	P.D. James has populated this Adam Dalgleish (AD) outing with a large cast of largely unsympathetic characters.<br />The first quarter of the novel is spent setting up the murder and establishing motives for over half a dozen could-be killers. In the middle half of the book, AD and team (Detective Inspectors Kate Miskin and newcomer Piers Tarrant) explore these suspects and discover a few more, without making any real progress in the case-and the progress they do make is due to evidence being (literally) handed to them, rather than the result of any actual detecting. Almost the entire final quarter of the book is devoted to a second murder and its fairly-straightforward resolution, with the first murder all but forgotten. When AD comes up with the identity of the first murderer in the final chapter it seems arbitrary and feels unsatisfying.<br />Enjoyment of the mostly fruitless investigation is hampered by DI Miskin's near-constant interior monologue alternately ruing the privations of her lower-class upbringing and feeling superior to the middle- and upper-class characters she encounters. DI Tarrant's green naïveté and arrogance don't help the portions of the book told from his point of view. And while James gives the reader the opportunity to see behind AD's emotionally-detached façade, it seems that what Miskin and Tarrant need to fully develop their personalities (and James her characters) is this same understanding of their Commander. (To be fair, Miskin may learn a little of this at the end of the book, but like the denouement, it seems tacked on rather than being part of her inherent growth.)<br />The book isn't all bad; James' writing is able to shine through her tarnished characters. Unfortunately, the uneven pacing and victims and suspects the reader cares little to nothing either for or about results in a novel that fails to satisfy.	2003-11-21

It isn't hard to imagine a macabre picture accompanying \\"Three Blind Mice,\\" but Addams goes further than the typical fare by including Grant Wood's \\"American Gothic\\" couple (as the farmer and his wife) and giving Mrs. Farmer an electric carving knife to de-tail the mice. Casting a mobster and beatnik as the \\"rat\\" and \\"cat\\" in the \\"House that Jack Built\\" poem is another master stroke. ...and just what have Mr. Sprat and his wife eaten?<br />My favorite illustration accompanies \\"Fishy, fishy in the brook/Daddy catch him on a hook....\\" Could anyone but Addams create a \\"Daddy\\" with a Capt. Hook-style prosthetic at the end of his arm? Classic. (\\"Little Miss Muffet\\" runs a close second to this poem and illustration.)<br />The \\"scrapbook\\" is a nice addition at the end of the book, but it doesn't quite live up to the blurb on the front of the dust jacket.<br />The only drawback to the book is that when the picture spans two pages so much of the illustration gets sucked into the binding. This most noticably detracts from poems like \\"The Old Woman Who Lived Under a Hill\\" and \\"St. Dunstan,\\" where the heart of the illustration takes place in the center of the image.<br />All in all, a great book; even the minor detractions serve to make you want more of Addams delightfully twisted artwork.	2003-11-17
