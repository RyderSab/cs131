I picked up a bunch of paperbacks at a rummage sale and there were a half-dozen of these types of stories all by different authors.  That said, \\"Sugar Cookie Murder\\" wasn't one of the better ones.   <br /> <br />Since I haven't read any of the previous books in this series, I have only this book to base my opinions on and that might be unfair.  However, this is supposed to be a stand-alone book. <br /> <br />Anyway, as several reviewers noted, the \\"mystery\\" was hardly a mystery at all.  The climax was horribly disappointing -- a quick confession and bang, end of mystery.  Apparently the cops did nothing but guard the doors and the detective sat in an office being cranky while Hannah and her sisters ran around and solved the \\"mystery\\".  Almost all the action -- such as it was -- took place in the banquet hall and focused on describing food.  Lots of food.  With a few million references to how cold it gets in Minnesota and how everyone there can drive through a blizzard like it was a warm sunny day.  Obviously there is a history between all the residents which, fortunately, wasn't too heavy-handed although it did get kind of confusing now and then. <br /> <br />I didn't particularly like the characters, either.  Again, the shallowness of everyone might have been because it's part of a series and there was more character-building earlier on.  But Hannah came off as a bit whiney, controlling and indecisive.  She has two guys on a string -- one is too good to be true but kind of ordinary, the other is an obnoxious, self-serving cop who is apparently hot for his secretary and Hannah both making him a class-A jerk, but he's a hunk so Hannah seems to cozy up with him moreso than the other guy.  But she uses the other guy whenever it suits her so she's not much better than the cop.  The sisters seemtwo dimensional, the mother is a ditz and the rest of the cast are mere shadows on the wall. <br /> <br />The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 (too bad sometimes you can't give 0 stars!) was because I am hoping/assuming the earlier books were better and this was just a filler book.  If I run across more of Joanne Fluke's books at a rummage sale I might buy them but I'm sure I won't be spending full price -- paperback or hardcover -- for any of them. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11
US	52902410	R85YWQB2U7RSH	1416513272	360957152	Clearing the Aisle	Books	1	4	5	N	N	Really Should've Gotten 0 Stars!	I can't believe this first came out in oversized paperback!!  Why would anyone spend that kind of money on this tripe?  I agree with the other reviewers regarding this book being unromantic and confusing for anyone non-Jewish.  I don't think I've ever read a more pointless, whining book!  The main character, Rachel, is completely unlikeable.  She whines about everything -- her family, her fiancee and his family, her friends... Nothing seems to please her or make her smile.   <br /> <br />Additionally, the author goes on and on about New York and all it's nuances.  I was sick to death of the \\"Seventies\\" New York, the \\"Eighties\\" New York, the Upper West, Lower East and Southern North side etc.  Who cares?  Was this a travelogue on New York?  And since she makes it obvious that NO one had any business living there except \\"true blue\\" New Yorkers, it wasn't even a fun diversion.  Actually it felt pretty insulting.   <br /> <br />And speaking of insulting, the phrase \\"people our age\\" came up far, far too often.  Apparently people HER age are supposed to be spoiled, whiney brats who feel that they are far superior to people NOT their age.  No wonder she's so obnoxious. <br /> <br />This story had no point at all except to showcase Rachel whining about wedding trauma after wedding trauma.  And to show off the author's knowledge of Hebrew and Jewish customs.  Instead of laughing at the situations the characters found themselves in, I was just glad when it was over -- I was actually a little whiney myself by that time, rather than feeling entertained.  The title should have been \\"My Big, Fat, Whiney Jewish Wedding\\".  I read the book once and gave it to the used book store in a \\"New York minute\\".  Don't waste your time or money.	2005-07-29

The charactors can make fun of themselves and seem to enjoy themselves even when they're in a tough situation.  That said, this book followed that pattern but there were a few things that increasingly disturb me...<br />It may not be PC these days to admit this but I don't truely enjoy reading about gay/lesbian love affairs.  Actually I don't like reading about ANY love affairs.  This is why I don't read romance novels.  Usually fantasy and sci-fi are light on romance if they have any at all which is fine by me. I can take a little mushy stuff but not much.  Usually Huff's touches of romance are light and easy to stomach but lately she's been getting heavier on the gay/lesbian theme which for me at any rate, takes away from the rest of the story.<br />Case in point -- spoiler ahead! -- the Shadowlord is supposed to be powerful, evil and feared.  He took out a whole order of major wizards in his home world.  It was never really explained why he felt it was imperative to come himself to our world but he did.  (And why WAS he so after Arra, anyway?)  Here's this super-powerful shadowlord and he gets defeated by his attraction to Tony??  [Please]!!  What a disappointment -- and it would have been just as disappointing if he had an attraction to Arra or Amy.  It's just an awful cop-out.<br />Well, anyway, the writing is good and the dialog is, at times, hysterical.  As another reviewer said, good but not her best.	2004-06-15
US	52902410	RLRM6IG5FW2RP	0756400805	334146334	The Book of Air: Volume Four of the Dragon Quartet	Books	1	9	11	N	N	A Real Let Down	I didn't come across this series until all four books were out (unlike some series I might mention -- Robert Jordon, are you listening??)so I didn't have to wait for years. This was good because I could read all the books one right after another, no lines no waiting.  It was bad because it made for some serious comparisons which are not kind to this book which was a huge let-down for the otherwise good series. (OK, I have admit that I DID find the &quot;dialect&quot; of the tinkers really irritating, too!)<br />The first three books really built up the Purpose of the dragons and constantly reminded everyone that the dragon Air was the most powerful, smart, essential dragon of them all.  The Purpose could not be accomplished without Air so their first mission was to rescue her.  OK, sounded good.  The plot was a little used and abused but the writing was good and there were some interesting twists.  But the fourth book sure didn't live up to its billing.<br />Supposedly Fire had trapped Air so the four dragons could not complete their mission.  How he managed to do this was never explained or even hinted at.  The actual &quot;release&quot; of Air was a huge disappointment!  And Air herself was an even bigger disappointment!!  After all this build up of how important she was to the Purpose, she never even shows up in &quot;person&quot; so to speak, and all she contributes to the goal is &quot;hurry, hurry!&quot; which got real old real fast.  Garresch -- who was the best thing happening in the whole book -- wondered if Air was even sane anymore.  That gave a nice, forbidding shiver -- imagine an insane dragon! -- but Air never amounted to anything.  Why did they even bother with her?  She was completely unnecessary and, for that matter, not at all developed as a charactor.  The Deep Moor dogs had more personality!!  What a waste!<br />The whole book was full of annoying loose ends.  Where did the nanomechs come from?  What was the purpose of the nano-city?  Why couldn't Air leave it under nano-power?  Why couldn't she communicate?  And all the personalities that had been carefully developed over the previous three books, were made 2 dimensional.  Paia and Fire had the &quot;hots&quot; (pun intended) for each other and that was that.  Erde and Earth were irritatingly serious and formal.  Water didn't play any kind of a role and D'Noch reverted back to being annoying.  The secondary charactors, Hal, Kothen, the tinkers, and the Deep Moor women, were given &quot;lines&quot; of dialog like a comic book might have.  Some charactors weren't even mentioned.  Where did the personalities go??<br />All in all it was a major disappointment.  It seemed like Ms. Kellogg was trying to hurry, hurry! with the final book because she left it hang too long and readers were getting mad.  If a writer can't finish a book in a decent amount of time, why start?  It's better not to start something than to finish it slap-dash and poorly.  It's too bad because I had some real expectations for this final book.	2004-06-08
US	52902410	R11HBB9R0UXIY5	0060575298	308042484	The Novice (The Black Magician Trilogy, Book 2)	Books	2	19	30	N	N	Hope #3 is Better	I really liked book #1, \\"The Magicians' Guild\\".  It was somewhat typical of the genre but it moved along fairly well.  The book had a few different elements and, I thought, really set the stage for books #2 and #3.<br />That said, I was very disappointed in \\"The Novice\\".  I know the middle book of a trilogy tends to be the \\"worst\\" -- or at least the slowest -- of the story but this book took this to the limit.  <br />At the end of book #1 we had a slum-girl who seemed pretty powerful magic-wise being convinced to join the Guild, and the High Lord practicing Black Magic in secret.  At the end of book #2 we have a slum-girl who is now a novice and is pretty powerful magic-wise, and the High Lord practicing Black Magic mostly in secret.  In other words, the plot has not advanced very much.<br />And the story was riddled with \\"preaching\\".  I HATE morality books.  Half the story was \\"rich-vs-poor\\" -- how the poor are not accepted by the wealthy and powerful.  Poor Sonea endured continual harassment by the rich novices.  It got so bad that I thought for awhile I was reading a \\"young adult\\" book about high school.  The details of the harassments went on for a huge chunk of the book but it was never made really clear as to WHY they hated Sonea so much -- other than she was from the slums.  The other half of the book dealt with Dannyl discovering he was a \\"lad\\", i.e. gay.  I don't mind stories with gay sub-plots when the story line fits.  But in this case it was clear that this was just a forum for gay rights -- how, for instance, in one country this was a crime punishable by death.  Dannyl spent most of the book deciding he was gay and the rest of it wondering how it would affect his career.  It added absolutely nothing to the plot/story line whatsoever.  In fact I started skipping any part about Dannyl about half-way through and didn't miss anything.  It just didn't fit in.  And it seemed like it was added just for this book since in the 1st book all we knew was that Fergun had started rumors about Dannyl.  It said nothing about the rumors being about him being a \\"lad\\" until book #2.  Obviously added on.<br />I hope for greater things from book #3 -- why, for instance, does the High Lord practice Black Magic?  He says he \\"can't tell\\" his reasons right now.  Hopefully they'll be good reasons and not lame ones...  Anyway, maybe the third book will be more like the first now that the author has spent enough (more than enough) time preaching and moralizing...	2004-05-10
US	52902410	R3TUR40IHR3T52	0812571339	656525801	Crossroads of Twilight (Wheel of Time, Book 10)	Books	1	23	24	N	N	Stop!	I tried to read this book.  But even though I did get through the whole sorry thing, I don't know what I read...<br />These books have been getting longer and more boring since around Book #6 or so when it became obvious that Jordan was no longer writing to tell a story.  Apparently he's now just writing for money.  If he gets paid per page, he's richer than Bill Gates.  Too bad since this whole thing started out so good.<br />A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... I'd been seeing the WOT books in the bookstores for a long time and I like big, thick books.  One day when there was nothing new out by my favorite authors, I decided to join the band and bought the first book, Eye of the World.  It was great!  So I ran out and got the second book... and the third... Unfortunately I didn't notice that Jordan hadn't finished the blasted thing.  I knew there were (at that time) eight books out and geez, I must have figured that 8 1000+ page books MUST be all there are.  How long can you drag a story out, anyway?  Jordan seems able to do this -- forever. The books began to bog down and the &quot;action&quot; slowed to almost nonexistant.  The gang never got any closer to the final battle, their problems were never resolved, and their relationships became murkier but didn't advance.  Jordan began taking chapters rather than a few choice words to relate something.  I agree with the reviewer who noted that Jordan used to be able to say &quot;They walked to the next town&quot; but now it takes many, many words to say the same thing.  How sad to go from storyteller to hack.<br />I did what I thought was the smart thing and got book #9 out of the library.  When book #10 came out, I didn't bother to even do that.  A friend gave me book #10 when it came out in paperback.  I tried to read it, I really did.  But it had been too long between books.  I skimmed through it but I didn't remember all the minor characters and plot-lines.  All I now remember is that Nyneve (or however it's spelt!) pulls her braid all the time and that all the women smooth their gowns constantly.  That's pretty sad -- over 10,000 pages and that's all I really remember.<br />And now Jordan is pre-milking his cash cow by writing a &quot;prequel&quot;.  I'm no english major but isn't it customary to finish a story before writing a &quot;prequel&quot;?  Honestly, if there are still people out there who believe Robert Jordan is writing for the love of storytelling and that he isn't a money-grubbing tree-killing hack, let me know -- I have a bridge or two to sell you.	2004-02-25
US	52902410	RKIH5LUYOZV4Y	0738703192	829813780	Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation	Books	2	13	18	N	N	Not Too Bad But Not The Best	Like several other reviewers here, I thought \\"wow, this is a BIG book so it must contain lots of stuff!\\" Well, yes and no. It IS big and it DOES contain lots of stuff but not necessarily lots of USEFUL stuff.<br />I have read several other of Silver's books and must say that she is not my favorite pagan author. She can be confusing and is obviously out to look \\"cool\\" and make a buck but she is amusing and sometimes informative. This time, however, it looks like she bit off a bit more than she could chew. <br />My first complaint is the format; it is very confusing and skips around far too much. I agree with others that this should not be your 1st book on Wicca. She writes as though she were reviewing techniques and concepts that she has already explained -- apparently elsewhere. Even the basics like casting a circle aren't very well explained. And while you're reading along, suddenly you stumble over a bit that someone else has written concerning \\"other\\" types of magick (such as hoo-doo) that really don't add to the part you were reading and, in fact, are often inaccurate.<br />My other complaint is that this book is obviously written for the teenager. I am not a teenager. I therefore did not buy (or read) her books on teenage witches. I resent having purchased a book under what I consider false pretenses -- i.e. that this book was for an adult, solitary witch. I do not need help with my homework, with acne or with peer pressure. Most of the spells she gives are geared for these kinds of things and that irritated me a lot. I would've thought she more than covered these things in her other teenage-geared books but apparently she feels these things are also of concern for the adult witch. Sorry, Silver, they aren't. Granted, teenagers are more easily manipulated to a particular viewpoint than adults (most adults anyway) so I would predict that those books sell better. But why insult the adults with a supposed \\"ultimate book of shadows\\" that is really geared to kids? <br />On the plus side, she is an amusing author -- even if she doesn't have the grounding in quantum mechanics that she'd like us to believe. There is some helpful information in this book, but you'll have to dig for it. I'd recommend Scott Cunningham's books instead if you are serious about the Craft.	2003-08-04
US	52902410	R16DIYRWDQCSFV	0553106635	549456361	A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)	Books	2	23	36	N	N	Long Winded	I have just finished this book and am still in a daze.  Actually I read all three of the \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" books, one right after another and my eyeballs are ready to fall out.  These are VERY long books!  Not that I at all mind long, thick books.  And let me say that there is something about the way that George R.R. Martin writes that is addictive.  Despite my growing frustration with this series, I could not put any of the books down and walk away.  He pulled me into whatever is going on at the time -- and often there isn't MUCH going on -- even if it is from the POV of one of my not-so-favorite characters.  At first I resented the back-and-forth of the book.  One chapter was about the Wall, the next was about Dany and her dragons... I was tempted to read all the \\"Jon\\" chapters, for instance, all at once and go back and read all the \\"Tryrion\\" chapters etc.  Except that it became obvious that somehow they are all tied together and that skipping back and forth wouldn't work...<br />After praising Martin's writing abilities, I have to say that the overall series is a big disappointment.  Some reviewers insist it's \\"better than Tolkien\\".  Not even close.  The first book, \\"A Game of Thrones\\" started off the series in good shape.  But by the second book, \\"A Clash of Kings\\" it was flagging badly.  This book confirms what I dreaded -- Martin is really Robert Jordan and will never end this story.  Jordon's never ending \\"Wheel of Time\\" series is on it's 10th 1000 page book.  I read the reviews for those books and many recommended Martin's series instead.  But what is the difference?  Other than the fact that Martin is a better writer, that is.  This series has bogged down.  How can you not advance the plot in 3000+ pages??  Sure we saw some major characters get removed.  But the plot itself -- i.e. who gets the iron throne -- is as far from resolved as it was in book #1.  There are a couple fewer king wannabes running around but still no real king in sight.  The remaining major characters go from one crises to another but never solve their own individual problems.  And from the trends in book #3, they aren't likely to do so any time soon.<br />I see there is a 4th book coming out (in hardcover, of course).  I would be very surprised if this was the final book of the series.  Why do these authors milk their cash cow to death?  Jordan is still going strong and it looks like Martin is following in his 10+ book footsteps.  When the 4th book comes out I'll get it from the library, if I read it at all.  By the time it's published I'll forget who is on what side (not that that is clear anyway) and what \\"ser\\" has which sigil.  Oh well.  Another promising author lost to the money god...	2003-07-21
US	52902410	RE7HHEL29JYA6	0843951702	243266322	The Only One	Books	1	6	8	N	N	A Yawner	Like many other reviewers, I have read some of Christine Feehan's stories and agree that this one was not up to par.  In fact the best part of this book might be the cover art -- which doesn't say much for the writing.<br />\\"Dark Descent\\" by Feehan was a disapointment.  It started off at least mildly interesting; a female body guard, astral projection, and of course the instant recognition of \\"lifemates\\".  But the characters were shallow and very gullible.  Joie's sister is a doctor specializing in microbiology and she didn't have a problem with vampires, dragons, etc?  Sure, they can communicate with each other through telepathy but that's a far cry from watching someone change into a wolf.  The story just seemed like it was written in a hurry with no attention to details.<br />\\"Star Queen\\" by Susan Grant was absolutely awful.  This story could have been written by an elementary school writing student -- and they'd have flunked.  The main characters were very unlikeable and unrealistic.  The male lead waited years to approach the female lead despite the uncertainties of their existence.  And when they did get together it was a one-night-stand sort of thing where the hero is flying off in the morning to almost certain death.  The heroine is not happy with this decision.  They argue, make wild, passionate love, and he leaves.  Turn the page and he's back!  Not only is he back but the entire universe has been rebuilt.  No explaination, just an epilog type ending that says nothing.  Very poor writing.  And the not-so-subtle religious preachings didn't add to the overall dismal story. Apparently Ms. Grant spent more time trying to find unpronouncable names for her characters than she did in giving them personalities and a plot.<br />The last entry, \\"Sacrilege\\" by Susan Squire, was probably the pick of a poor crop.  I've never read anything by her before and I think it would have helped if I had.  The story wasn't terribly original and was hard to believe; a vampire monkwho had been essentially brainwashed for over a thousand years suddenly sees the light all because of a rather obnixious female vampire?  I don't think so.<br />There are better anthologies out there.  If you have to read this, read it at the bookstore or library but don't waste any money.	2003-06-02
US	52902410	R13T2H3853NE6C	0425181685	449119181	Narcissus in Chains (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 10)	Books	1	9	10	N	N	Simply Porn	I fully agree with the many reviewers who say this series -- which started out great -- has degenerated into nothing more than a vehicle for LKH to try and write porn.  Many of us hoped that her \\"Kiss of Shadows\\" series would satisfy this unfortunate desire of hers to write smut but apparently it has not.  And she is ruining what was such a wonderful series.<br />Anita Blake was a young, tough, smart woman who was also a Vampire Executioner and Necromancer.  She had a smart mouth, was funny and insightful.  She even managed to have morals and standards within her strange situations.  What's not to like?  Why ruin a good thing -- and call it \\"charactor development\\"??<br />Because Anita IS ruined.  It's almost as if LKH was writing backwards and instead of improving, she's getting worse.  NiC hardly had a plot at all.  This problem is most noticable in the last few books.  Does a plot get in the way of LKH writing porn?  Apparently.  The final scene was so rushed and slapped together it appeared as an addendum, not the final slam-bang ending.  And she wound up all the issues that had run through the entire over-long book in the epilog!  Was Anita really going to be \\"furry\\" at the full moon?  What about Richard?  Was she going to be kicked out of the werewolf pack (and, by the way, is EVERYone in St. Louis a were-something?  It must be quite an event every full moon)  Can JC accept Anita being a total slut?  All these things were dragged endlessly through the book and were dealt with in 2 pages.  Reeeaaallly bad.<br />Does Ms. Hamilton read reviews?  Does she notice that her readership is unhappy?  Does she give a rats behind?  If she really wants to write porn, she should do it.  But not in an existing series that was not designed for it and is not benefiting from it.  Check the book out of the library but don't waste your money.	2002-10-30

None of the charactors are particularly likeable or very interesting.  And none of the plotlines seemed to go anywhere.<br />Morgan: is a whiney, sickly young woman who, as one reviewer said, seemed to spend most of the book dying.  She is obsessed with Dante's journals and falls madly in love with him despite the fact she believes he's long dead and was a \\"madman\\" who thought he was a vampire.  Hardly a stable personality and she sure doesn't endear herself to anyone.  The vaguely described \\"psycic connection\\" between some vampires and Chosen was added as a sort of psuedo-explaination of why Morgan and Dante are \\"meant to be\\" but it just doesn't suffice.<br />Dante:  the romantic lead.  All he does is get shot with crossbows and bleed a lot.  He's originally pissed at Morgan for putting his story on the big screen.  But for no apparent reason he abruptly becomes crazy for Morgan -- a sickly, whiney woman at best -- and makes mad, passionate love to her (and bites er all over) even while she's busy dying.  Yum, yum.  What a guy.  He even attacks the only one willing to give him a break -- Lou -- twice.  A real hero.<br />Maxine:  a little more interesting, particularly her smart mouth and take-charge attitude.  But she also gets weak and whiney when all her friends start being hurt, dying etc.  Her wanna-be romance with Lou is kind of intriguing but it doesn't get resolved so it flops in the end.  And the sub-subplot of Morgan/Maxine and Lydia is just too much to take.  Speak of totally over-done cliches!!<br />The whole book was based an one of the worst cliches -- the evil Big Brother Government who has secret agents everywhere.  And apparently these are SUPER secret agents since the lead Evil Agent managed to sneak around taking pictures to threaten Max with the very day after he had been \\"terribly burned and scarred\\".  If you are burned badly enough to scar --especially on the face -- you probably aren't up to skulking around the following day.  <br />So all-in-all, \\"Wings in the Night\\" is MUCH better.  This wasn't even a \\"B\\" grade vampire story.	2002-09-03

But I have to agree with the reviewer who noted that this novel is not up to speed with Hambly's usual efforts.<br />There was so much left not explained in this book.  Why was the magic fading?  Why were there many scenes regarding the teyn but these creatures never came to anything?  Why were only men able to work magic in the beginning?  None of this was explained, only kind of hinted at &quot;there might be more&quot; (maybe a sequel...) We were left hanging on far too many topics.<br />And I'm afraid that this effort came across as a little too &quot;women are downtrodden&quot; for my taste.  Ms. Hambly often has a strong female as the central charactor which is great -- as a female myself, I find this refreshing.  But she doesn't usually &quot;man-bash&quot; her male charactors.  This novel had quite a bit of abusive men, lazy men, violent and stupid men.  The women had to &quot;suffer&quot; being regularly beaten by their husbands.  Men had real names but women were named strange things (often by their husbands) like &quot;Summer Concubine Woman&quot;.  If an unborn baby was male, a regular healer was called in for the birth.  For a girl, the women handled it on their own.  This kind of thing might be alright in setting a scene or describing an environment.  But it was pretty heavy-handed in this novel and, I think, detracted from the book itself.<br />All-in-all, just not up to Barbara Hambly's usual excellence.	2002-09-03
US	52902410	R31FV1P1E9MEI6	0879517352	17010078	Saint Fire (Secret Books of Venus, Book 2)	Books	2	4	7	N	N	Not As Good As It Should Be	I love Tanith Lee.  I've read almost all of her books over the years and although she has had a clinker or two in the past, \\"Saint Fire\\" is an unexpected clinker...<br />\\"Faces Under Water\\", the first book in this series, was very good.  The story, the characters and the writing all made it a great read.  I expected the second book to follow the pattern but it didn't.  <br />\\"Saint Fire\\" almost seems like a rewrite of some older story or a half-hearted attempt to continue the Venus series.  This story sure didn't move along.  There was far, far too much \\"religious-ness\\" which, in parts was necessary but in other parts was over kill.  The heroine -- Volpa/Beatifica, was typical Lee:  a frail, quiet, pale girl with gold eyes (do all Lee's heroine's have gold eyes?) who has a Power.  She isn't particularily interesting and you just can't get to like her.  Which is also typical Lee... Oftentimes you find that you end up more interested in a secondary character than the main ones.  But even here, none of the characters roused any sympathy or interest.  The \\"knight of God\\", Cristiano, was cold and strange.  The Magister, Danielus, was manipulative and weak.  The plot itself was weak, too.  Out of the blue, \\"infidels\\" from another country come screaming across the sea to attack the \\"good guys\\".  Why?  There was no good reason for a war except the obvious -- the heroine can call up fire at will.  The ships of the enemy are made of wood.  Hmmmm.<br />Well, anyway, I really looked forward to this book and was very disapointed.  It dragged and staggled along to a very un-exciting, un-interesting finish.  And was confusing in between.  If a no-name author had tried to get this published, no editor in the world would have agreed.  Because Tanith Lee is a Name, the editors evidentially don't bother to read her stuff over.  I can only hope that if there is are books 3 and 4, they are better than this.	2002-07-07
US	52902410	R2RZCV3MYI6CI7	0765342936	577960303	More Than Mortal	Books	1	2	3	N	Y	Plot?  What Plot?	I enjoyed the first two &quot;Renquist&quot; novels, despite some glaring inconsistances.  However, &quot;More than Mortal&quot; was too tedius to be fun.<br />Farren's writing seems to be getting more and more florid and he spends far too much time on pointless descriptions.  It took Renquist 10 pages (of very small print) just to get into the priory to say &quot;hi&quot; to the troika.  And all he did for those 10 pages was skulk around -- there was no action, just lots of retoric.<br />The basis of the novel, the finding of &quot;the Merlin&quot; a.k.a. an Ursu left over from the beginning, hardly figured into the story.  Most of the time is spent describing scottish habits, dress codes, and behaviors while the reader has to fight his or her way through trying to figure out the meanings of pages of supposed scottish accents.  How irritating.<br />The final denoument is nothing at all -- the Merlin wakes up, the Merlin chats awhile, and the Merlin leaves.  Renquist and his merry band are left looking like morons and wandering around the Fenrior's castle trying to figure out what next -- apparently so was the author.  He just gave up and went home.  Don't waste your money.	2002-04-07
US	52902410	R232E0RMFOVQUE	0743434528	805529355	Night of Dracula	Books	1	7	8	N	Y	Awful!	Despite the garish cover, I was prepared to like this book.  After all, Bela Lugosi IS Dracula and his son's forward was the real hook.  Unfortunately, the forward was the best thing about this attempt at modernizing Dracula.<br />The \\"story\\" was vague and disjointed.  It is supposed to be set in the year 2000 and some of the charactors in Stoker's Dracula appeared, but in different combinations.  For instance, Mina is married to Dr. Stewart, not Jonathon Harker.  The tale becomes very confusing.  Apparently Dracula is now a poet who is broken-hearted about losing his wife, Alyssa.  Who??  Well, there just happens to be a girl who not only looks like Alyssa but is married to an army surgeon who is conveniently overseas.  There are lots of added distractions such as a mention of AIDS, antibodies, Bosnia, a pointless attack at a bus stop, etc.  Nothing went anywhere or was important to the minimal plot.  Most of the book is full of this drivel -- pointless descriptions, poetry (bad poetry at that) and bits and quotes from the Stoker book.<br />The detective in the case, who was at best a minor charactor, becomes the hero who is apparently conflicted as to his beliefs in justice.  In one instance he is passionate about bringing Stewart to justice after his murder of a prostitute was discovered.  On the other hand he is passionate about forgiving Dracula for killing drug dealers...?  He's stupid, as well -- how many times has he been told that bullets don't affect vampires?  The author doesn't seem to know what side of the arguement he wants his charactor to be on.  Dracula, too, comes off as a panty-waist one minute and a fiend the next.  I suppose the author was trying to show the duality of Dracula's nature but he missed it completely.<br />All-in-all it was a waste of money.	2002-03-04

Being from Wisconsin myself, I was astounded that such a National Treasure (OK, a bit of an exaggeration!) was so close by and I never knew of it!  I'm certainly going to make a visit to the place this year.<br />The book itself is interesting for it's close-up pictures and photography.  Unlike one reviewer, I didn't mind seeing the vintage dolls in less-than-mint condition.  After all, that's the way most of these dolls look.  There are plenty of Barbie books out there that show MIB dolls.  It was refreshing to see \\"real\\" dolls, too.  I don't believe the prices that were quoted were for the photographed dolls; they clearly stated \\"MIB\\" (mint in box) and most of those dolls weren't mint.<br />What I didn't like about the book was 1) it's outrageous price!  (...)It's nice but not THAT nice.  And 2) there didn't seem to be a lot of continuity to the format.  It jumped around from vintage to mod to new and back again.  That became confusing and somewhat irritating.  It also skipped a lot of the \\"Barbie family and friends\\" dolls.<br />If you are looking for an identification and pricing guide, this isn't it.  Neither does it give much explaination as to the background/history of Barbie doll.  Buy it for the pictures!  And the address of the museum and plan a trip to Wisconsin this coming summer!	2001-12-06

Actually, the execution was VERY poor since I'm still trying to fight my way to the end of the book.  Normally I'd finish a book like this in a few days.  But it's simply a boring book and so it's difficult to find the time to finish it.  <br />The basic idea was interesting; a typical hard-boiled detective and a young, naive teenager with paranormal abilities team up to hunt down the bad guys.  In this case it was a mystery of a double murder.  Not two people murdered, but the same person murdered twice.  Kind of catchy... Not.  I did not read the initial book of this series which evidentally explains where Sara -- the teenager with the abilities -- meets Chase Dagger the hard-boiled detective.  Nor am I going to read that book.  &quot;The Good Die Twice&quot; has almost done me in with Sara's over-sickly-sweetness and naitivity.  She's apparently been so sheltered that she gets along better with a bird than people.  Her attempt to dress up and walk in high heels was insipid and added nothing to the story.  She's so naive that she follows a drunk to his bedroom, then panics and has to beat the snot out of him and change herself into a hawk to boot.  The difference between her actions -- one minute the shy, sweet young girl and the next minute Rambette -- might have been interesting if explored properly.  In this case it was just a &quot;switch-on-switch-off&quot; type thing. <br />Chase Dagger, apart from his name, isn't any more riviting than his young partner.  He spends a lot of time fighting off his ex-fiancee because he's busy thinking of Sara, a girl young enough to be his daughter.  So he's torn between being a dirty old man and a protector of the innocent.  When he isn't angsting over Sara in some form or another, or chasing his bird around, he's playing in his &quot;secret room&quot; which is stuffed with weapons -- of course.  Geez, how corny can youget?  The only member of the team who is tolerable is the bird, Einstein, and he's merely annoying.<br />I don't know if I'll ever get to the actual &quot;whodunit&quot; part of the book.  I'm having a hard time caring.	2001-10-17
US	52902410	R152T210HR6IFE	0970671008	40333729	Romancing the Holidays, Vol. 1	Books	2	2	10	N	Y	Too Fast	The concept of this anthology was pretty neat -- each story had to involve a holiday. Any holiday, including Arbor Day and even Bosses Day. Interesting... Well, not really. Of course most romances are &quot;boy-mets-girl&quot;, the two potential lovers face a few crises, and voila, end up living happily ever after. The trick for the author is to take this outline and make it interesting. It's hard to do that in a couple of pages and these stories were VERY short and therefore very rushed and included little detail and no charactor-building. However, even in a short story a good author can at least stir some interest. Most of the stories here do not do that. In fact a couple of them were so trivial that you really wonder why they were included at all. The story about St. Patrick's Day consisted of a parade-organizer falling for a cop in a kilt because he showed her how to turn her megaphone on. In several anothers the theme was &quot;boy-returns-to-hometown-to claim-girl.&quot; A tired theme to begin with and in this book, it was deadly. One civil war soldier shows up -- on New Years Eve --after disappearing with no goodbyes, to claim he wrote the girl a letter which wasn't delivered because of the war. She, of course, forgave him for years of neglect almost instantly. Another adventurer turns up on Arbor Day after spending years in Alaska to claim the girl he left behind -- after ignoring her existence for years. Again, she forgives him and they live happily ever after. As in all anthologies, some stories are better than others. But none of them were good enough to justify the price of this oversized paperback.	2001-08-27

I have got to agree with the zillion reviewers who find themselves confused over the many, many charactors, minor plot lines, politics and so forth of the WOT.  The overall concept is good, the basics are solid and interesting enough to keep a reader coming back, but there is plenty of over-kill in this series.<br />One reviewer wondered why people complain about too many charactors and why can't these folks use the internet to find out who is who?  Well, simply put, they CAN.  The real question is, why SHOULD they?  Yes, there are very good web sites out there listing who is who in WOT.  But geez, do I want to run to my computer every time an unremembered name comes up?  Especially since this happens often -- and I read the series back to back twice!  Get real.  Checking out charactors on the internet in order to be able to go on reading the book(s) is stupid.  It breaks up the story and, other than satisfying curiousity, serves no purpose.  The complaint people have is not that they can't find out who is who, but that they need to do it in the first place.<br />I think, as do many others, that Jordan has let this series get away from him and now he is rambling on in a holding pattern.  This book did advance the plot somewhat but there still seems to be a long way to go.  How many more books will there be?  And how long do we wait for them?  I like reading a nice, thick book but at least let there be some movement to the series!  Let's ease up on the rhetoric, the constant bits about smoothing skirts, pulling braids, etc.  Let's get past the blue fingernails and all the myriad fashions and get to the Final Battle!  Hopefully before Rand gets to be an old, old man -- along with three wives and a million kids!	2001-08-08

I finally made it to the last installment of the WOT and am amazed I can still see.  After how many pages?  And it's still nowhere close to being finished!<br />I have seen the WOT books in stores for years and finally decided to read them -- all at once and without realizing the series wasn't finished yet.  But ignorance is bliss and I plunged into EOTW with gusto.  Wow!  Good book!  On to book 2!  As on... and on... By the 5th book I was seriously thinking of abandoning the whole thing.  Unfortunately, it's addictive so I plodded on.  I did get through &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; although I admit I checked it out from the library, having no desire to shell out bucks on a hardcover.  <br />What happened to the good stuff?  Somewhere in this intermitable &quot;middle&quot; Jordan lost his train of thought.  Or maybe the whole train.  I agree with reviewers who say you need an encylopedia to keep characters straight.  Even though I read the series back-to-back, I can't remember who is who.  There must be a million names to try and keep track of.  I don't even remember what group the name is affiliated with!  So confusing!<br />And the plot has certainly deteriorated to the point of being drivel.  Can we please get Elayne crowned so we don't have to follow Andorian politics any more?? (I can't follow US politics, how am I supposed to remember who is head of what major Andorian house and whose side it's on??) Can we stop hearing about the trauma poor Rand faces trying to fight off three women -- and how much they love each other, too, even having to share their man?  And can the aes sedai please get their collective acts together so we don't have to waste any more time on which-sister/ajah-is-on-what-side? (And who cares?) <br />It's fun to invent a whole world, complete with geography, politics, clothing (and we certainly hear enough about fashion styles, don't we?!).  I suppose it's natural to want to tell everyone all about your new world.  However, a millionpages of fluff does not make up for the thousand pages of good reading.  &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; was better than the preceding 3 or 4 books but it still wasted the lives of many, many trees.  Come on, Jordan.  Let's stop milking the helpless addicts (such as myself) and give us a good old-fashioned slam-bang ending!  (And maybe not even mention Nynaeve pulling her braid this time!!)	2001-07-25

I'm not going to regurgitate what the story was, who the characters were, etc.  I do agree with the reviewer that said the number of businesses in a small town -- even a &quot;resort&quot; town, was hard to believe.  But the entire story was hard to believe!<br />Good horror is believable.  That's why it scares people -- because this COULD happen to YOU!  Unfortunately, &quot;Eternity&quot; tried too hard to incorporate too much and became muddled rather than believable.  <br />First off, there is the unbelievable number of murders.  When you count up them up, you'll notice that the killer has wiped out a nice percentage of the population!  And the &quot;town council&quot; won't address the problem.  Then there is the issue of &quot;lifers&quot; -- people who have apparently come through &quot;the vortex&quot; and stop aging.  And there is the Brotherhood -- whose function is mysterious and remains so since it stays on the sidelines and is never explained.  And the ending/confrontation is a total disappointment.  As one reviewer said, a real rush job.  After a zillion pages of build-up, the reader must feel like &quot;that was IT??&quot;<br />The writing is well done and the characters are fun but the entire story is just too much of a mish-mash for true horror.	2001-04-19

Other pictures are a little darker, but overall the photography is good.<br />The only complaint I have is that the book has some annoying little errors -- like &quot;Gold Rush&quot; is listed as a Skipper outfit!  And the misspellings like &quot;bow&quot; for &quot;beau&quot; detract a little from the professional image.<br />But these errors are relatively minor and overall this is a good book to have to identify some of the more difficult-to-find outfits and accessories!	2001-01-17

I expected great things from two of my favorite genres put together!<br />Alas, it was not to be.  The story is only a rewrite of Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; with Holmes kind of thrown in for flavour.  There is absolutely no point for Holmes' involvement and, in fact, the client who brought him the case in the first place just sort of disappears.  The story remains more-or-less true to the origional which, as I said, means there is no reason for Holmes to be there.  The action, such as it is, is confusing and unnecessary.  For example, a lot of space is taken up with a boat race which seemed like it was written in just to put some action in the story.<br />As much as I wanted to recommend this, I can't.  A much better mix of Holmes/Dracula is Saberhagen's &quot;The Holmes/Dracula File&quot;.  Give this one a miss.	2000-12-14

The interactions between them were fun since it was the male who got mad at such things as his cakes being eaten too soon, etc.  The plot itself was pretty weak and there were all kinds of asides that were merely distracting and totally unecessary.  But it got  laugh or two.<br />&quot;Short Hot Summer&quot; was nice to read as the weather gets colder since the description of the heat was believable.  Unfortunately the story wasn't -- believable, that is.  Can a high-power business man who actually schedules every minute really decide in a week that he'll live in an un-air conditioned hotel in the middle of nowhere and do nothing?  Even for love? Hmmmmmm.<br />&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was the story I liked best.  It was funny and I learned a lot about dog shows.  Although I can't see the pampered heroines -- both girl and dog -- moving to a sheep ranch, the dialog and interactions were lively and the parts where the dogs got to have their say were great!<br />&quot;The Princess and the Adventurer&quot; was the worst of the lot.  A very typical &quot;indiana jones&quot; type plot -- girl looking for someone/thing gets into trouble and the tough-guy has to bail her out.  Neither charactor had anything new or even interesting to recommend them.  Boring.<br />All in all, not a bad read but nothing too deep or memorable.	2000-09-28

It certainly  isn't the worst but it's a long way from the top ten.<br />The story isn't  very origional but then again there isn't much origional about vampires  anymore.  The writing was good; sound and evocative.  Unfortunately there  was little to no charactor development.  You just didn't care one wy or the  other about any of them, good guys or bad.  Also there were contradictions  all over the place.  For instance, why could vampires at the Residence get  up during the day if necessary, yet Cynara was unable to move at her hotel  room?  Lots of loose ends, too.  Obviously left for the sequel.  Hope it's  better!	2000-08-25

The writing was sharp and evocative, the plot was intriguing and the characters really came alive.  I  couldn't wait for more!<br />Unfortunately the author has never reclaimed the  past achievement.  The writing remains exteremly good but the plots have  degenerated to the point that, in &quot;O Jerusalem&quot;, there is  none.<br />Ms. King does a commendable job in painting pictures with her  words, descriptions, and dialogs.  Unfortunately in this book, the pictures  are constantly of Mary Russell being dirty, smelly, hungry, etc.  We are  subjected to long discourses on historical biblical sites that add nothing  to an already thin story line.  Nothing is explained regarding &quot;the  case&quot; but much of the book is taken up with arabic customs, words and  dress.  Interesting in a travelog but not in a &quot;mystery&quot;.<br />I  hope the next book in the series concentrates more on Sherlock Holmes, Mary  Russell, and a good mystery than on Jewish custom and history.	2000-06-29

I have found, for the most part, that it doesn't make much difference in the quality of the story if the author  is a &quot;famous&quot; author or relatively unknown.  The writing may be  good but the story is trash.  As was the case here.<br />Why do authors have  to incorporate famous people with Holmes?  How many &quot;ripper&quot;  stories have been written?  Now we find Holmes on the Titanic -- and  apparently the &quot;mystery&quot; was secondary to the description of the  ship.  We also are subjected to a story regarding Doyle's temptation into  adultry -- since when has Holmes been a marriage counselor?  And to have  him and Watson race to get to the hotel &quot;in time&quot; to prevent it  is not only stupid but hokey as well!<br />A few stories had merit but not  enough to make the price of this over size paperback worth it.	2000-04-05

The plot  device about a legendary city of women -- who eventually fall under male  dominion -- was very contrived.<br />The following story was just plain  boring.  It was also poorly written and left a lot of little details  hanging.  Not that they were important, just annoying.  <br />The bondage  story by Thea Devine was awful.  There didn't seem to be any point to it  and the erotica wasn't even up to Harlequin Romance standards!  All the  characters did was snipe at each other and think about being in  &quot;power&quot;.  Yawn.<br />The last story by Robin Schone seems to be the  one that everyone liked but again, I thought it boring and contrived.  It  was better written as far as the prose and dialog was concerned, but the  plot was old and tired -- a storm for crying out loud!  -- and although the  sex scenes were better than some of the other stories, there just wasn't  much believability there.  <br />Oh well.

The basic premise of this book is one that has been used almost to death -- a dungeons &amp; dragons type of parallell universe gets in trouble and sends for help from our world.  Usually some techno-geek because that's the  one thing the fantasy world doesn't have. In the Wiz Biz there is simply  too much computer jargon -- even for those of us non-wizard types who  actually understand the stuff.  And much of the jargon is junk anyway!  So  why add pages of it?  Who really cares (other than a computer wiz) what a  &quot;daemon program&quot; is?  Does the quantity overcome the lack of  quality?  No.  If I had wanted to learn computer programming, I'd have read  a programming book! Similarily, there are pages and pages of descriptions  of dragon-riders flying in formation, swooping to the kill, etc.  I skipped  them eventually since it definately added nothing but filler to an already  weak plot.  There is just too much chaff -- useless filler -- in this book.  Can anyone say &quot;sequel&quot;?  Geez.  If all the loose ends had been  tied up, the sequel would be harder to write.  Fortunately for the author,  the number of loose ends could fill a trilogy or two.  Unfortunately for  the reader, these hanging traumas only make for confusion and annoyance.  Most SF &amp; F stories are made to have a sequel.  But they at least  finish the current story first!  All I can say is, save your money!!!	1999-10-19

The basic plot isn't too bad, although not  very imaginative.  The details were the most annoying things about the  book.  For instance what, if anything, did the female doctor Bailey have  about her that caused two ancient vampires to fall madly in love with her??   She, like the other characters, was very shallow and flat -- no real  development at all.  Nothing in the little personality description would  lead me to believe anyone, let alone two powerful beings, would give her a  second glance. And then there were the loose ends; what happened to the  priest and, by the way, what did he find in the rain forest that scared  him, why was his involvement with a woman in any way pertinent and, mostly,  why was he in the story at all?  Why was the dying gangster -- who wanted  only to die in his own bed -- in the story?  Why bother going into detail  over these characters if they weren't going anywhere? As I said, the plot  is sturdy, although predictable.  If you don't mind all the annoying loose  ends and hard to believe sub-plots, it isn't as bad a &quot;vampire  read&quot; as some other books currently out (Such as &quot;Blue Moon --  Anita Blake Series&quot;.  Ugh!)  Just don't expect too much.	1999-02-18

The basic premise of a world where all the legendary creatures were real and believed in if not  accepted, was very tantalizing. Add to that a hard-hitting, smart-aleck  heroine who is the vampire executioner, well it sure sounded good to me!  And, for the first couple of books, it WAS good.  A little bloody at times  but that's what happens when you mix vampires, werewolves and zombies.   Anita's inner torment over whether or not to sleep with the bad guys was  kind of boring but didn't get in the way of the plot too much so it was  OK... Until the last few books and especially Blue Moon.   Blue Moon was  absolutely the worst book of the genre that I have ever read.  I agree with  other reviewers who say that the violence and sex was the entire plot and  that Anita has become an unreal heroine -- supernatural powers, sex appeal  to attract any living (or non-living) creature within a hundred miles, and  an attitude which besides being hypocritical, is very boring. I hope  Hamilton will give her urge to write erotica a rest -- she isn't very good  at it -- and go back to the basics.  Get rid of the whining were-whatevers,  keep the charactors who add more than sex and violence to the plot, and,  for heaven's sake, take Anita down a few notches to make her believable --  and maybe even likeable (which she currently is NOT) once again.	1999-01-26
US	52902410	R1YXE3IVELEPRP	0312156391	511598218	The Resurrected Holmes: New Cases from the Notes of John H. Watson, M.D.	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Not Too Bad...	Overall this is a pretty good collection. The concept of having authors  try and write a story not only in the Watsonian style but also in the style  of another author (such as Lovecraft,  Hemingway, etc.) made for  interesting reading.  For the most part. Several stories were very good,  most were good-to-mediocre, but a few were just plain bad. The &quot;beat  generation&quot; rendition and the very strange rendering of &quot;Vamberry  the Wine Merchant&quot; left a bad flavor.  (Or is that  &quot;flavour&quot;?) All in all, better than some.  Not as good as others.	1998-10-21

I read the entire Anita Blake series 4 months ago and this last book, and  especially the rave reviews for it, leave me confused...<br />The last few  books in this series have been more character development than mysteries or  thrillers.  But at least there was SOMEthing to built a plot on, however  thin.  &quot;Blue Moon&quot; doesn't even have that!  The  &quot;mystery&quot; -- supposedly the &quot;spear that pierced Christ's  side&quot;  -- didn't even come up until very late in the book.  And then,  to make matters worse, there didn't turn out to be any spear,  anyway!!<br />This whole book served as nothing more than a vehicle for lots  of pointless violence and far too much sex.  Violence can be very effective  -- and it was fairly effective in the earlier books -- but this story  throws in  killings, beatings, etc. apparently just so the heroine can rip  her clothes off (reminiscent of Captain Kirk in &quot;Star Trek&quot; --  anything to tear his shirt!).  Sex, too, can move the story along nicely,  but there has to BE a story first.  As far as I could tell, &quot;Blue  Moon&quot; would not exist if all the sex and violence were removed.  Which  means that those elements WERE the entire plot.  And that isn't enough.   <br />I agree character development in a series is important but there does  need to be a plot, too; otherwise you end up with a Harlequin Romance.  I  hope the next book gives the relationship stuff a rest and gives us  something to turn the pages for.  If I'm subjected to another  book full of  &quot;who should I sleep with??&quot; I'll have to give it a miss.	1998-10-12
US	52902410	RHAYOKKEO2B7W	0425154734	432406733	Holmes for the holidays	Books	3	1	5	N	Y	Some Good, Some...	The title is quite clever, although a little misleading.  There isn't a  lot of Christmas involved -- of course, with Holmes, there wouldn't be.   Some stories are, as usual, better than others.  Some are downright bad.  A  few have the distressing tendency that some Holmes &quot;fans&quot; have to  glorify, or at least &quot;redeem&quot; Watson.  Let's face it, true Holmes  fans don't read the stories to hear about Watson! Despite a few clinkers,  this is a pretty good book -- but I wish it had been available in  paperback!	1998-09-16

I have been a Brook's fan for years but am not deluded into thinking that because a certain author wrote a book it has to be good. This one certainly proves that isn't true.<br />If I had wanted a &quot;who's my father&quot; story, I'd reread &quot;Star Wars.&quot; If I wanted to read teenie-bopper, teenage angst stuff I'd look in the &quot;young adult&quot; section. I thought this was sci-fi/fantasy but it wasn't.<br />Besides 200 extra pages of boring, unecessary descriptions -- typical of Brooks -- the characters themselves were shallow and boring. John Ross, the &quot;Knight of the Word&quot; spends his entire time whining about being a knight and how miserable and loney his life is. In the end he wasn't even necessary for the plot. Nest Freemark spends HER time whining about how tough it is to be a teenager who is different. She whines about her friends and grandparents. She whines about her looks. Angst everywhere. No substance, but a lot of cute young girl stuff. Even the demon was flat and boring -- the contrived plot of everything having to occur on the 4th of July didn't convince me he was in any way powerful. The rest of the cast wasn't any better. The union grandfather, the alcoholic chain-smoking grandmother and, of course, the token single-working mother who plays the required love interest for Ross. Ugh!<br />Especially irritating were the descriptions of Ross' dreams of the future. I eventually began skipping them since they added nothing to an already thin plot and only served to give something more for Ross to complain about.<br />Everything considered, this book was not only disappointing but annoying to read.	1998-08-27

As a long-time fan of vampire fiction, I have had the opportunity to read many different kinds of novels, shorts, etc.  Although &quot;The Ruby Tear&quot; is certainly not one of the worst, it isn't one of the best, either.<br />The story is pretty mundane; a vampire with a grudge against the family who wiped out his family centuries ago.  He wants revenge and the jewel the invaders stole.  Of course there is the tragic heroine and star-crossed lover story line.  And of course the vampire -- who should be old enough to know better -- falls for the girl and screws up his revenge.<br />The story moves along but it really is more on the order of a Harlequin Romance than the true vampire genre.  Not bad for a snack, but don't expect too much substance.	1998-06-03
US	52902410	R3M18O635MYGUA	0451454073	265809330	At Sword's Point (Knights of Blood)	Books	3	1	5	N	N	A bit too much needless gore.	I have read many books in the vampire genre, including the first book of this series &quot;Knights of the Blood&quot;.  This particular novel is, unfortunately, not one of the better stories out there. The basic layout isn't bad, albeit a bit unbelievable, with 700 year old knights, Nazis, Cossacks and whatnot.  However the plot is so thickened that it becomes very difficult to follow -- too many sharp turns.   And then there is the totally unnessecary gore.  The prologue opens with one camper being beheaded while &quot;relieving himself&quot; .  And, by the way, there does seem to be some obsession with this type of bodily function -- several victims lose their lives during this process and there is a lot of &quot;execrement and urine&quot; used as descriptives.  There follows several other very bloody, gory deaths -- a couple more beheadings, a few twisted stabbings, poking holes in corpses, etc.  While it is understandable that blood plays a major role in a vampire novel, the detailed, violent descriptions detract from what plot there is.  Gore may have its place in some novels, but here it just seems to be added for effect rather than necessity.  It would have been more acceptable if all that blood 'n guts helped fill in or make comprehensible the mish-mash plot.  But, alas, it doesn't help.  I ended up confused anyway!	1998-01-06
