When I finished the book I could not decide exactly on what happened.  The profound,  deep symbolism in this short novel trascends its natural limits,  and derives us to another angle of thought.  Kurtz it´s not just him;  is all of us trying to fight adversity,  unknown realms (territories also of our soul) gasping something, believing we are dominating it,  and then..the horror,  the horror<br />Marlow is our leader:  he pushes us to the heart of Africa (our heart,  our nervous system?),  to the vast unknown,  longing in finding our heroe,  and, in the process,  becoming one ourselves.<br />This novel expands our conscience (if we know how to read what´s not written) permits to get in touch with our innerself,  find the horror,  but defeat it,  and start each day with the unmistakable knowledge that we start over again,  and that all depend on us;  on how do we plan the journey. We must not just walk,  we have to go...	2002-07-26

The mixture of reality and fiction and then this two again (but is this not magical realism?) permits the reader to ellaborate many a book within the book,  as then a lot of writers did<br />2) Onetti is usually &quot;benchmarked&quot; with Faulkner.  Yes, they both created their own space (Santa Maria) but there is where the similarities stop.  Santa Maria is the first Macondo,  the newest,  paradoxically,  way to be at leisure in its own territory.<br />3)Onetti´s book was not an instant hit,  but in certain circles ,  and thru viral marketing,  ABL virtually dissappeared.  The same happened later with other books,  especially with the first edition of 100 years of Solitude.<br />Finally,  ABL created the first step in the ladder of extraordinary works of art that came out of Latin America in the 50/60s,  that,  again,  was badly depicted as a boom.  It was more the creation of a new current,  and a new way to say,  new,  and old things.<br />This book will allow you to fully understand this period,  and it will open and broaden the way you read	2001-02-20

How many civil wars can our countries suffer without autodestroying itselves?  How many years have to go by before we understand who we are,  what we are  doing and how do we fit into a master plan?<br />Well,  Garcia Marquez  discovered it:  none.  Or hundred.  But he discovered something more  important:  time is something it happens when you want to be aware of  it.<br />GM told his wife (back in the 50s) not to bother him for a year,    (you see,  time can be a personal invention) because he was going to write  a masterpiece.  Mercedes did miracles to mantain her family for that  period,  but finally,  when Gabriel emerged,  he had 500 pages of pure  wonder.  His first tentative title was &quot;La Casa Grande&quot;  (The Big  House) but,  if he was to invent a new category (magical realism) he  understood he must choose a better title.  No printer in Mexico (where he  had wrote it) or in Colombia (where he was born) accepted it.  So,  with  the last few bank notes he had,  he sent it to Buenos Aires.  Yes,  the  only copy of it (and there was no Fedex!) Editorial Sudamericana published  it immediately,  and it was a storming success.<br />Since then,  this novel  triumphed all over the world,  despite translations (I´ve read it both in  Spanish and English and the magic´s there) and,  with the help of  Cortazar´s Rayuela put Latin America in the cultural map.<br />But what is so  astonoshing about a lost town,  a family that repeats its names and its  traumas,  set in a country whose distraction is doing the best to eliminate  themselves from the face of the earth?<br />1) He demostrated that the  judeo-christian theory of linear time is just a myth.  Like Galileo before,   he´s discovery was rejected,  but now we know better:  time is circular,   but we can modify it if we only have the guts to do it.<br />2) Good  literature does not need parameters.  Long sentences?  Repeating names?Difficult to follow plot?  To destroy,  one must first create,  and this  novel inventend not only a new theory of time,  but also a new one in  literature.<br />3) You must have one and only one objective when writing.  be  honest to yourself.

Isn't more  misteriuos to think that the town is somewhere deep in Mexico?  Perhaps you  can meet Juan,  and all the other ghosts (?) that make Comala so  irresistible.<br />After this novel,  Rulfo didnot inked a new line:  what was  the case.

Written when he was 26,  Arlts life is a perfect metaphor of deja vu:  hes a similar case as Dostoevsky:  sick, a failure as an inventor,  has to  write and publish his books in chapters because of his debts,  died young,   at 42,  but left behind one of the most ironic and intelligent  protagonists:  The Astrologer:  Always finding a way to change the  conservative way of life,  hes a parabolle of failure and dreams,  but  magnificently sketched in few,  precise lines.  If anyone wants to  understand the greatness of Latin American literature,  this is a perfect  start.	2000-07-04

In another tour de force,  this compulsive player (he has a statue at the Baden Baden Casino) shows that,  although all his tortured problems (no money,  sickness) he  grasped the meaning of life and the perfect way to expose it.  Do we all  want,  at least one day,  to be a Raskolkinov,  take justice in our hands  and avenge everything and everyone?  But then,  why the remorse?  Guilt is  more than just repentance:  is knowing that you did not have another  possibility,  and acted in consequence.  One of the books that formed the  conscience of Man in the XX Century	2000-07-04

Ive enjoyed this new view of things,  because the authors truly believe in what they say.  They are not your typical gurus trying to make  money with their new book.  Original,  entretaining,  and, above all,  will  give anyone who works with the net,  has a wide view of business and a  little of power to change things, the perfect tool to start from scratch  and reinvent the way we talk to each other,  either in work or in our  private life.	2000-07-03

Falstaff and Hamlet as role models of all western literature?  And why not Raskolnikov or Don Quixote?  What about Yourcenars Hadrian? The book is a tour-de-force,  but  sometimes Bloom let us show (hey Harold,  we know) how intelligent he is.   Like in the Western Cannon,  his opinions are more than that,  are  inequivocal truths.  Reading other reviews,  the word  &quot;opinionated&quot; blurts out,  like a critic.  Why are someones so  afraid to listen and learn what other really think?  In my country,   Argentina (and in Latin cultures) is a must	2000-06-28

I do not know if its difficult or  easy to read,  but when you are more than just a reader but also jump  inside the book,  and write it together with the author,  you are brushed  away,  swept into a new realm,  and sigh:  hes right,  life is worth it.   Do no try to critize the book with difficult words:  just live it,  and  choose who you want to be:  Bloom or Dedalus	2000-03-27

At first just saw as one of the Latin American &quot;Boom&quot; Generation,  it soon turned out that, no one around the world a book  impacted more on readers and writers.   To call it a representative of the  boom generation diminishes somewhat its greatness: itss one of the few  books that changed the way we approach to literature.  Its a book that  many a reader will find difficult to follow,  but then again,  its not for  everyone;  just for those who have an open spirit and enjoy excellent  literature	2000-02-01

What Im looking is for practical information; I know the drill (is more or less the same in nearly all  authors).  And these two guys really worked with a lot of companies, and  show us how to do it in our businesses	2000-02-01

The first two novellas of this book are worth readingm  but the Moorhouse collectrion descripition was,  perhaps,  one of the borest things I ever read.

Perhaps the best first novel ever to be published,  this is not just Adrian's love for Antinoo but a reflexive,  complex anaylsis of power and education.  Platonic and non platonic love for a person of a same gender can be seen as nromal,  despite the books setting. One of the best books I ever read	1998-07-07
