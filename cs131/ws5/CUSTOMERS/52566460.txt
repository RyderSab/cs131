Reading from a teleprompter is not exactly brain surgery. But if you want to hear more from a self-important blowhard, then read this intriguing book about an egomaniac who pretends he doesn't have one. Seriously, there couldn't be a worse book.	2004-05-18

You mean to tell me that scalping Nikkei futures is how the \\"Ivy League cowboys raided the Asian markets for millions\\"? Clearly, this author is in way over his head attempting to understand the complex strategies employed by hedge funds to achieve their extraordinary returns (as well as blowups). The description of the Japanese sex trade is a boring diversion that eventually becomes an irritating pebble in the shoe of the book. Ultimately, the book is a superficial story lacking any real insight into how real money is made. And why is that? Because they ain't going to tell you!	2004-05-10

Wow, I mean Karen Hughes is such a patriot -- she thinks everyone should fight for her cause except her own family. But what else do you expect from someone's who supposed to be more loyal than the family dog?<br />After reading the book, my question would be how could such a smart woman worship such an ignorant, sheltered, phony that stumbled into being President. Is this the best our country can do, a pampered son of a former President who had a track record of failure in every other past venture? Or how about a corporate crook who sold his shares ahead of a bad earnings report and then failed to file with the SEC? Or how about a drunken driver who very easily could have killed your loved one?<br />In any case, you'll get some clear insight into the mind of a Stepford wife, a blind devotee and true believer in the equivalent of a village idiot.	2004-04-07

Bill Phillips makes a major point though - you can make healthy and delicious meals in a short amount of time (he goes overboard here - fast food really is faster, don't try to convince us that it's not). But I think the real strength of the book is that it truly presents a way of &quot;eating for life&quot;. Frankly, those Atkins dieters are off their rocker. You're telling me I can't drink a glass of orange juice in the morning? Those diets eventually end in a massive ingestion of carbs and failure.<br />Here's what I like about the book: the recipes are great and easy to make. For example, the turkey meatloaf contains oatmeal and egg whites. It is disgustingly healthy and yet it tastes delicious. I really can live with this. The recipes are balanced and varied at the same time. Chicken enchiladas with cheese - awesome. To top it all off, you get one day off to eat anything you want.<br />I think the brilliance of the book is that all these years I've been looking for SOMETHING that doesn't require ridiculous sacrifice: no carbs, no fat, no sugar, etc. Stupid. Anyone, and I mean anyone, can eat this way 6 days a week, knowing that there's one day to indulge. The key is that it's all mental -- knowing that you don't have to &quot;start&quot; a diet on a Monday. You want a way of eating that is a seamless transition and where you can be in control. This book does that - highly recommended.	2003-12-18

I saw the Wellstone memorial on C-SPAN: the liberals turned a serious service into a tasteless campaign rally. The same kind of thing happens when you show Democrats a videotape of the Ron Brown funeral where Clinton is yukking it up, catches the camera, and feigns tears. Democrats will swear up and down that's not what happened even when confronted with reality. The problem with Al Franken and most Democrats is that they're not thinkers, more like emotional reactionaries. They just want to &quot;do something&quot; for &quot;the children&quot;. Any decent conservative can dismantle Franken's arguments in about five minutes because like most Democrats, he is afraid of facts. I think Franken did better work as one of the worst Saturday Night Live performers ever. The most hilarious outcome of this book is the &quot;liberals get tough&quot; act. Can't wait to see the liberal radio network fail for lack of real intellectual debate...	2003-09-11

Is it possible to get a fair review of the book if these online back-scratchers didn't sow their 5-star seeds in each other's fields? As far as the book goes, it's full of cute stories but as a practical speculation tool, it's downright comical. The authors cite the VIX as their favorite indicator and present a brief study of the market's performance after the VIX hits a certain absolute level. Hello Grandma, the apple pie's already been baked! The VIX ain't that easy any more, but the authors pony up their hypothesis as if it were an earth-shattering insight. As my surf buddy would say, this is trading for dilettantes, DUDE!

If they're so good, then why aren't they full-time traders themselves? You'll find the typical &quot;trading is war&quot; analogies and hey, look at how those professional athletes train!

King or D. Steele). By the time the publisher and distributor extract their pound of flesh, the author is left with a meager cut. When an author writes a book, several other factors must be considered: ego, sharing knowledge, recognition, leaving a legacy, etc. Did the reviewer actually read the book or just paint a broad stroke?<br />A mechanical or system trader has plenty of time to focus on other tasks throughout the day in between executing orders. In fact, the reason why many system traders fail is because they spend their time babysitting positions and get sucked into making emotional decisions, i.e., taking the quick profit or ignoring the stop loss. It is so easy to sabotage a system, especially if you feel the need to exercise control over the trading decisions (that's 99% of us).<br />Stridsman's book is important because it provides the framework surrounding a trading system. You can plug any trading system into his evaluation model and generate all of the required performance metrics. Further, a trader who understands the details of the system and understands its behavior gains more confidence in trading the system. I recommend this book and Ralph Vince's \\"Mathematics of Money Management\\" for further understanding.	2002-11-20

Call a CNBC reporter and wait until they breathlessly deliver their \\"breaking\\" news. A pattern seems to be emerging with this parade of books from self-important Bubblecasters; they really have no idea how useless they are. So they pose with their Brite-smiles and try to tell you how much they know about investing, even though they are prohibited from buying stocks (I've never done brain surgery, but let me talk you through it). By the way, these reporters are quite self-conscious about other body parts (wink wink nudge nudge).

Most of the stuff written the past several years has been daytrading mush; you can go to a bookstore and read them faster than a dinner menu.<br />I first became familiar with Alan Farley through his Internet site, the Hard Right Edge, and had been eagerly awaiting this book since August. Now having read it, the technical content is without parallel. Read every sentence and savor it like a fine wine. Having been a professional trader since 1995, some of the content took me aback because in some cases he has quantified relatively obscure market factors that are the foundation of some of my proprietary trading systems, and you think nobody else knows ;-). For example, read the \\"Time of Week and Month\\" section on pages 235-237; this section alone is extremely significant.<br />The book is crammed with candlestick charts and systems that will take you to TradeStation or MetaStock to test out the various patterns. Part Two of the book is The 7-Bells, a series of chart patterns with detailed setups and lots of examples; a minor nit is that the candles in some of the sample charts are scrunched together.<br />As a trader, this is the book I wish that I could have written. You may ask why a successful trader would publish a book with all of this accumulated knowledge. I guess the answer is that one doesn't HAVE to, but to share years of experience amassed in a difficult profession is extremely generous.<br />There are plenty of good research books on trading such as \\"Trading Systems and Methods\\" and \\"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends\\", but it's great to have someone who can teach you how to build a trading strategy and then execute it; this book could be subtitled \\"A Practical Guide to Stock Trading\\".	2001-01-07

For several years, I always thought that there was a missing dimension to trading stocks and wondered how certain stocks go up so fast compared with others. When trading IPOs, one always looks at the stock's float because if it's very small, then the price move can be explosive in some cases.<br />The first thing I did was program all of the float indicators in TradeStation and even devised some of my own based on the ideas in the book. The whole idea of the float turning over at critical turning points turns out to be valid. As Steve Woods points out, float analysis in and of itself is not a solution, but if you pay attention to the trend of the float channels and have some kind of market analysis tool for short-term direction, then it is a gold mine.	2000-10-20
