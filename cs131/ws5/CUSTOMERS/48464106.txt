It's always refreshing to read a book from a new author, especially one that stands out from the rest. Plenty Good Room by Cheri Paris Edwards is one of those rare Christian novels that offer readers a peak inside the heart and soul of the lost. Readers will get a chance to witness how God truly never leaves or forsake us.<br /><br />Tamara Britton is a child advocate who leads a quiet, lonely life. In one night her seemingly controlled life changes when fourteen year old Sienna Larson is dropped off at her home. In a matter of days, Tamara's world is turned upside down after she agrees to let Sienna stay in her home for an unlimited amount of time. Normally a calm, controlled person, Tamara often finds herself being pushed to the edge by Sienna's rude and endless troubles.<br /><br />In the midst of her struggling relationship with Sienna, Tamara's mysterious past slowly comes to light as she searches for a childhood friend. During her search, she learns how to open her heart to relationships. Her openness allows her to create a stable environment and an opportunity to bond with Sienna. Unexpectantly, a romance begins to stir for her with the main suitor being God himself.<br /><br />Cheri Paris Edwards provides readers an eye-opening look at the disturbing consequences of poverty, drug abuse, child abuse, homelessness, and the juvenile system. Truly foster parents, social workers and childhood advocates have a special role in bringing a sense of security to a lost child. With sadness, some children are totally lost in the system. While they seem to be forgotten, Cheri Paris Edwards shows how God never forgets us. While fictional, Tamara's story is a testimony that deserves to be read!	2005-09-22

Not normally a historical fiction reader, nor aware of Christian fiction yet, I became an instant fan of Sharon Ewell Foster after reading her award-winning debut novel Passing by Samaria. The second novel Ain't No River was a laugh out loud contemporary read that sealed Foster as one of my favorite authors. Last year I was delighted to read Ain't No Mountain as Foster introduced several new colorful characters and brought back a few from Ain't No River. Who knew a trilogy was in the works!<br /><br />In Ain't No Valley, Foster introduces a few new characters and brings together several characters from the previous two novels. With a contemporary setting, readers will recognize a few biblical stories like Ruth, the prodigal son, and the wedding feast. How does Foster manage to bring so many characters together? Well, a California wedding creates the perfect event.<br /><br />In Ain't No Mountain, Moor and Mary met via an online internet service. The couple falls in love and with few resources, they call on family and friends to help them put together their special day. Mary calls on her best friends Latrice, Thelma and Naomi to be bridesmaid. Naomi unfortunately is going through a crisis and seems to have lost it according to her friends.<br /><br />Naomi is not the only one going through a crisis. Foster introduces a new character named Anthony, Moor's friend and former co-worker. Like Naomi, Anthony finds himself jobless and at the crossroads of his life. In the midst of the chaotic wedding preparations, Naomi and Anthony seem oblivious. They are not oblivious to the odd, but God-loving people who have become apart of their lives. While way outside their comfort zones, both of them make life changing decisions.<br /><br />As the wedding date draws closer, the apprehension builds. The bulk of the wedding preparations are taking place in North Carolina where MeeMaw (Ain't No River) is designing an elaborate wedding dress for Mary. An unlikely person is preparing the wedding cake to the horror of many and the travel arrangements seem to go down hill as the choice of transportation becomes a yellow school bus. The cross country ride from North Carolina to California is no doubt the most memorable and laugh-out loud reading I have done all year.<br /><br />Wow! There is so much going on in this novel. It is truly an incredible reading experience. Always weaving in God's word without being preachy, Ain't No Valley is a must read especially if you read the previous two books, Ain't No River and Ain't No Mountain. I'm sure anyone can pick up with reading Ain't No Valley without having read the first two. Foster does a great job of tying in how everyone fits into the story. If you have read the other two, reading this novel will make you feel like you are reuniting with family and friends.ring the wedding cake to the horror of many and the travel arrangements seem to go down hill as the choice of transportation becomes a yellow school bus.

I have been very impressed with the books I have read from Walk Worthy Press this year! Many of the authors are first-timers. Meet three awesome sistas in What A Sista Should Do.<br /><br />Pam is a successful career woman, mother of two and often a reluctant wife. She married a musician whose big dreams have now become a big pain. Being the sole provider of her home, Pam no longer puts much trust in her unemployed husband desires to make it big in the music industry. Her disdain is evident every time she meets one of her husband latest hip-hop wannabees.<br /><br />Taylor is a single mom struggling to make ends meet for her and her young son. Regretful about her involvement with a married minister, she continues to hold her head up and refuses to leave her church home despite the stares and talk. Unfortunately, as her struggles increase, Taylor must break her safely kept secret, her son's father.<br /><br />Yvonne is a minister's wife and God-fearing woman. Her marriage seems perfect on the outside and even in some ways Yvonne herself is oblivious to the true state of her marriage. In a jolting matter, she will find out her husband is not the godly man he may seem.<br /><br />How do these three women from the same church connect? Unknowingly in her pursuit to reach out to Taylor, Pam gets stuck in the middle as Yvonne discovers her husband fathered Taylor's son. It seems unlikely that Taylor and Yvonne would want to even be in each other's space which at first they do not. Forgiveness and the overwhelmingly sense to pray for each other through some difficult events create an unusual bond.<br /><br />There are quite a few novels written about the bond between female friends, but I believe this is the most unusual set of friends I have read about. It's unusual because the friendship among these women is a true testament to the principles of Christianity. Each woman has her own problems and unique personality. In the beginning the common denominator between the three women was the church home they share. By the end of the novel, readers get a strong sense of the power of prayer and its effects over the most difficult circumstances.the three women was the church home they share.

So much has been shared about the Proverbs 31 woman. This \\"superwoman\\" has intimidated many women through the years. Often readers forget the Proverbs 31 woman had a very supportive husband. In verse 28 it says, &quot;Her children respect and bless her; her husband joins in with words of praise (The Message; emphasis mine).&quot;<br />In her latest book, In Search of the Proverbs 31 Man, Michelle McKinney Hammond goes through a list of characteristics a Proverbs 31 man should possess. Unlike some of her other relationship books, this one was not written with just one particular group in mind. Men and women whether married or single will benefit from the principles addressed. Some principles seem unattainable, but Michelle emphasizes God strengthens people through the Holy Spirit to fulfill their current or future roles as Proverbs 31 mates. Thought-provoking reflections and further study ideas are provided at the end of each chapter for each gender and couples.<br />This was a well laid out and thoughtful book. The book is definitely not just for men or single women in search of a mate.

Sucessful therapist Dwayne Grandison was still mourning the loss of his wife from a car accident when his brother, Pastor Lafayette Grandison approaches him about working with a new ministry at New Covenant Assembly. The position involves working closely with counselor Nina Jordan, an ex child star. Nina has successfully founded a female counseling program at the church and needs Dr. Grandison's expertise for the new male counseling program.<br />Approximately around the same time, Dr. Grandison is recruited by well-known evangelist Beverlyn Boudreaux for a talk show host position on her brand new Christian television network. Sparks fly as Dwayne works with both women in two very different atmospheres. Beverlyn's world is glitzy and glamorous, while working with Nina is more laid back and in the trenches of the church.<br />As the talk show becomes increasingly successful, Dwayne gets caught up in the traps of fame. He also grows closer to Beverlyn who reminds him more and more of his deceased wife. Unfortunately somebody very close to Beverylyn does not appreciate the budding relationship and proceeds to destroy Dr. Grandison's reputation with false rumors. Dr. Grandison will soon find which one of the two women will stand by his side as everything falls apart.<br />As the first novel by real-life therapist Ronn Elmore, this was a pretty good read.

About 40 churches were burned in an 18 month period. Reminiscent of the church burnings of the civil rights era, emotions ran high as racism bore its ugly head. M.C. Beamon's sophomore novel, Eyewitness, tackles the topic of racism and takes us behind the scenes of a church burning investigation.<br />An early morning jogger is murdered after he stumbles upon Beulah Baptist Church on fire. Inexperienced officers must tackle the murder investigation and find the person responsible for burning several churches in the South. As the readers digs deeper into the novel, they find the predominantly African American church was built despite much adversity in a well-to-do neighborhood. Finding the suspect should have been a large task. In their haste to nab a suspect, the investigators concentrate on one eyewitnesses' report instead of examining all leads. With a suspect in custody, the police department's case disturbingly unravels.<br />Beamon's talent for detail and developing characters are strongly displayed in her second novel. Clearly she has grown as a writer and makes extensive use of her journalist skills to produce a very believable, gripping story.	2003-02-24

Gloria D. Tillis Jones reveals and focuses on the highs and lows of how women treat one another.<br />The first relationship most women have are with their mothers. In some cases, a solid relationship may be built with the grandmother who is the main caregiver. In the first short story \\"Mama Creole, the reader is introduced to Gabriella Angelique Bardot. Due to the death of her mother at her birth, Gabriella is raised by an incredibly strong matriarch Mama Dear. Gabriella grew up to become a very blessed, but generous individual in her community, known to those around her as \\"Mama Creole\\". Though never having children of her own, \\"Mama Creole\\" embraced family, friends and at times complete strangers. Readers will definitely find a little piece of their own mother, aunt or grandmother in the delightful \\"Mama Creole\\".<br />Where \\"Mama Creole\\" is a story of warmth, the second story \\"Triple Threat\\" is a sad story of betrayal and unbridled wrath. Raised in a broken home, Moiya Towers develops a close relationship with her best friend, Diedre during their years at college. The close relationship continues to flourish as the two women become business partners. Engaged to marry the dashingly handsome Kallos, Moiya anticipates having the family she has always imagined. Her dreams are shattered as the two people closest to her, Deidre and Kallos, commit the ultimate act of betrayal. Moiya unknowingly through surpising circumstances spins out of control on a path of vengence. Along the way, she discovers details about herself and her past. Truly shocking and fascinating material arises from this story!<br />The last story \\"Genocide\\" centers around Gayla Camray, the director of a women's clinic. A \\"Mama Creole\\" type, Gayla builds a support system for hurting women in the community. Through her own life experiences and those of the women she serves, Gayla discovers a pattern of destructive behavior among women against other women.<br />In this trilogy of stories, the reader is bound to be able to relate to one or more of the characters.

Her warmth and desire to reach out to others serve as a sterling example for all women.<br />The following quote is being included with this review because it wrapped up the message of the book so eloquently. \\"Women have it hard enough without being so down on one another, suspicious, jealous, and backstabbing ....

And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. (1 Corinthians 13:13)<br />What a powerful story of love, hope and faith Angela Benson has woven in Abiding Hope.  If you read Awakening Mercy, you will be reintroduced to Marvin and Shay.  We found out in the previous \\"Genesis House\\" novel, that this couple suffered a tremendous tragedy, the loss of their only son.  After a separation, the two start their life again. At the beginning of this novel, the couple is relocating from Atlanta to Mississippi to start another Genesis House.<br />At some point in a relationship, a married couple (any couple) will be put to the test.  The success of the marriage depends on how the couple handles conflicts and trials.  The bliss of this renewed marriage is threatened when Shay becomes pregnant.  Shay had been longing for another child and is overjoyed. Unfortunately, Marvin does not respond in the same way. Marvin's fear and reactions to this new child places a wedge between the couple.  As this wedge gets deeper and deeper, Shay and Marvin must learn the hard way that their problems not only effect them but those around them.<br />The author does a great job NOT be one-sided in this novel.  She could have easily pulled the reader to the expectant mother's side (especially those desiring children like this reader).  You can easily think of Marvin as being overly silly and doubting God, but the author pushes the reader to view both sides. There is always two sides to a coin. I love how Benson brings the husband and wife to this realization.	2002-08-20

The best parts of the novel is reading how characters come to the realization that they are missing an important piece in their puzzled lives...God.
