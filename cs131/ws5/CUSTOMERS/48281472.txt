This book does not present the flowery and heroic pictures of historical people and events that we have been fed our entire lives.  Instead the author gives us a picture closer to what actually happened and the what the people were really like.  Worth the read, but one must be skeptical of what the author says.  Not everything he says should be treated as gospel.	2005-07-10

'The Real Lincoln' is a different look at one of the most respected and written about icons in United States history.  The picture drawn of Lincoln by DiLorenzo is probably more realistic than the one we have been fed our entire lives.  To the shock of many people, the Civil War was not fought to end slavery.  It is one of the biggest lies, if not THE biggest lie in American history.  If one sees politics and war for what they really are, one will realizes their actions have very little humanatarian purposes.  The American Civil War is no exception.  The Civil War was fought to keep a strong economic system together and in tact.  It was fought to keep the Union together, and the slavery reason was a deceptive political trick, just like the \\"terrorism\\" reason for going to war with Afganistan and Iraq.<br /><br />Thomas DiLorenzo is too one-sided though.  His book is too simple, and the Civil War is much too complex to examine than as done in this short book.  One has to read and understand other books in order to gain a fuller understanding, but DiLorenzo is not far off the mark.  DiLorenzo also repeats himself too much in the book.  Find me one other war in the history of the world that was started to end slavery.  It makes no sense.  It makes no sense to go to war to end slavery.  Other countries ended slavery in much simpler fashions.  Lets bring Abraham Lincoln down from his heroic and angelic stature and see him for what he really was; a shrewd and cunning politicians who started the war for cynical reasons and not for \\"freedom\\" and \\"democracy\\".	2005-01-18

'Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders' is an examination of Charles Manson and his cult and the bizzare trial that occurred during the late 1960s and early 1970s.  I read the book to see what the Charles Manson hype was all about.  There was some interesting moments, but most people in this generation would not be impressed with someone like Manson.

Vincent Bugliosi tackles the mighty and famous O.J. Simpson affair that captivated a nation for an entire year.  He does a fantastic job of showing how Simpson was without a doubt guilty of the double murder.  He also shows how the prosecution blew a completely winnable case with their passive and imcompetent fight, ignoring many key pieces of evidence and not being more aggressive towards the defense.  He also shows how ridiculous the defense theory was that the police had framed Simpson.  A good read, but still could have been written better.  The writing is at about a high school level.  A few things wrong here and there though.<br />Bugliosi is often way too critical though of the prosecution.  He does not realize how stressful the trail must have been for both sides.  The mistakes made during the trial was because of the intense pressure and media coverage.  Bugliosi himself may have made some major mistakes if he was under that kind of pressure too.  I've also heard that Bugliosi was not present inside the courtroom during the trial.  I think he did not attend a single day of the trial while it was happening.  This does not help him either; if he is going to criticize the defense and prosecution, he should have been present in the courtroom!  The book also includes the police interview with O.J. the day after the murders, Simpson's letter, and a few other extras to fill in some missing questions people might have.	2004-12-31

'My 60 Memorable Games' is a fantastic collection from one of the great players in the history of chess.  But, if one happens to run into the Batsford edition of the book, don't trust it at all.  Fischer has publicly spoken as to how Batsford has ruined his book.  Here is the website where Fischer talks about it.  [...]<br /><br />It is true.  It seems like the people at Batsford are purposely trying to ruin his credibility.  They are trying to make him look like an idiot, like a no-good potzer.

'Unintelligent Design' is a monumental work in the on going \\"debate\\" between creationism and evolution.  Perakh exposes the fraudulent claims made by Johnson, Dembski, and Behe, showing them as narrow-minded, one-sided, and unscientific.  He shows those who favor \\"intelligent design\\" are not out to seek real truth, but are actually trying to impose a religious ideology on society.<br />Certain sections of the book are boring and unnecessary.  This is because Perakh takes the time to demolish ridiculous beliefs only religious fanatics want to believe.  No rational person would believe in such nonsense.  Nonetheless, Perakh dismantles the beliefs to the point where they have no validity.<br />The \\"intelligent design\\" theorists try to make the scientific society look dogmatic and totalitarian, when in fact, it is the other way around.  The scientific community, for the most part, is more open minded the the religious community.  Science and the theory of evolution are the best explanations of how everything came to be.  \\"Intelligent design\\" and most religions don't explain anything, and have no intellectual curiosity whatsoever.	2004-03-24

The second most famous book by Immanuel Velikovsky, 'Earth in Upheaval', is much more interesting than 'Worlds in Collision'.  One of the main reasons why is because Velikovsky does not focus too much on Biblical stories and ancient stories from ancient cultures.  That's what killed 'Worlds'; although the ancient stories were a little interesting, they were boring for the most part.  I also doubt if the history was accurate too.  I doubt if all the events described all happened at the same time.      Here Velikovsky is a little more scientific, but his science if very flawed.  I doubt most scientists would take him seriously.  Recommended reading for those who are interested in alternative archeology.	2003-07-04

I don't know how credible his theories are but his histroy seems off balance and his science seems very ignorant.

Being born a man will automatically give a person more chances in life than being a woman. 'Memoirs of a Woman Doctor' is the story of an Egyptian girl planning to become a doctor. She lives in a society where a woman's chances of climbing the socio-economic ladder are slim to none. Being the only woman in her medical school, she constantly tries to denegrate men and sometimes scolds humanity in general. She feels men are not the \\"Gods\\" that her mother thought they were. She tries to rationalize humanity, saying they are no better than animals. In all this time, she seems to have no attachment to humanity; all she seems to care about are her studies and her career. The ending of the book can be interperted in two ways. Some will feel it is a cop out (like I did) and others will feel she learned a very important lesson about this life. Nonetheless, it is a facinating read into the heart and mind of a smart, but frustrated woman living in a socitey dominated my males.	2002-04-23

Jonathan Rosenbaum's book is his frustration over two things; the lack of foreign films in the United States and the anti-intellectualism of this culture. He is a critic for the Chicago Reader who writes the longest, most complicated reviews for movies that you'll ever see. This is both a positive and a negative style. Positive in a sense it shows he cares for films and works hard to find the overall truth in them. Negative in a sense that very few people would care for what he has to say. Movies, for the most part, are an escape for most people. A chance to forget about life for a little while. That is why awful action movies are constantly on top of the box office. Films are an artform, but for the most part, they are an industry, a business. Mr. Rosenbaum feels there is a lack of foreign films in the United States. This is very true, but it is a problem a very small minority care about. Exposing the American public to more foreign movies might be good, but who will ulitmately watch them and take them seriously? Another segment of the book deals with his attack on the AFI and their '100 Greatest Movies'. This \\"chapter\\" can also be found on his website. Once again, only a real movie critic could argue with such a list. How many people have enough time on their hands to evaluate a 2 dozen or even a dozen movies, let alone 100!! He makes his own seperate lists of '100 Greatest'. The big problem with this list is that most people have never even heard of most of these titles. And I'll guarantee most people will have a hard time finding them. Mr. Rosenbaum has made some strong points, and this is a very enjoyable book that won't take long to read. But ultimately, Mr. Rosenbaum is shaking his fists into the wind. The problem he is concerned with is a luxury problem. Most people don't have that luxury to begin with.	2002-04-22

Rarely has there been a book with such simple statements with such profound meaning. What this man saying is very deep, but seems to have no practical value. Even the chapter titles speak for themselves; 'A Quiet Mind is all you Need', 'Abandon all memories and expectations', 'What pleases you keeps you back'. At the same time, while reading, my mind would feel a calm like never before. The book has the power to change people's lives, but in a good or bad way depending on the perspective. After reading, one might realize everything they have worked for in their life has been a useless endeavor.

Although Kasparov has personal problems, just like everyone else, I really didn't see a tourtured soul. The subtitle was misleading. The book read more like a second draft rather than a finished copy. I think the author was in a hurry to finish it before a deadline because his writing is not very impressive or convincing. Nevertheless, there are some fine moments, especially some sections of Kasparov's match with Karpov. But on the other hand, Garry is not the most intersting person in the world. One of the greatest chess players ever, but certainly not a man one would want to write and entire book about. The book faltered there; it was about a genius with an average personality.	2001-05-18

The game with the famous Nd7!! and then Rb4!! Although they were sealed moves by Kasparov, it is an unbelievable combination...No games by Paul Morphy!! The first star of the game of chess has no games in this book. Also, Fischer/Spassky 1972, game 10. Fischer played, in my opinion, one of the most devestating endgames ever. Finally, Deep Blue/Kasparov 1997, game 2. One of the greatest players ever resigns in a drawn position! The game should have been in here for its historical value. Other than that, it is a good book for a reasonable price.	2001-03-02
