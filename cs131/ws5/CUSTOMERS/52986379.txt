Alas, the idea was had by Gregory Maguire, who seems to have a lot of really good ideas but no real idea of what to do with them.<br />There are a lot of interesting ideas in Wicked, from recasting the Wizard of Oz as a Hitlerian Machiavellian political schemer and tyrant to having Glinda and the Wicked Witch be childhood pals.  Unfortunately, the ideas remain ideas, and Maguire never makes the book take off into anything special or memorable.<br />If Angela Carter had written this, it would have been an unforgettable adventure into fantasy, terrible and beautiful.  Gregory Maguire takes a dazzling idea and makes it dull as dishwater.  Quite simply, an ordinary novel about extraordinary events and characters.	2003-10-06

His notes on the repetitious dialogue in this film, and in much of Kubrick's work, are very interesting, even if they don't go very far.  <br />Unfortunately, entirely too much of M. Chion's writing is vague and unmoored, unorganized.  In the beginning of the essay, Chion makes what must be one of the most ridiculous assertions in the history of film criticism: that Eyes Wide Shut is narrated by Bill and Alice's unborn (and unconceived) son.  This little bombshell is dropped into the reader's lap and not explained for several pages, and M. Chion's evidence to support this outlandish claim is, to say the least, unconvincing.<br />If you want to read an interesting and thought-provoking essay on Eyes Wide Shut, seek out Thomas Allen Nelson's excellent book on Kubrick, entitled Kubrick: Inside A Film Artist's Maze.  It is clearly and concisely written, and Nelson never makes an outlandish critical interpretation without rock-solid evidence to back it up.  M. Chion would do well to follow Nelson's example.	2003-08-21

The author just keeps hitting the reader over the head with the same information.  By time I reached page 400, I looked back and realized that any proper Victorian novelist, or actually any proper novelist, would have accomplished in approximately 100 pages what it takes Faber over 400 pages to accomplish.  I can't fault Mr. Faber on ambition, just on execution.<br />Read some Dickens or some Trollope instead.  They're faster, funnier, and far more interesting, to say nothing of being far less BORING, than Mr. Faber.	2003-07-24

James novel	I've recently read a good deal of Baroness James' work, and found much to admire if not a lot to like.  While clearly and intelligently written, her works all too often come perilously close to sinking under their own High Moral Weight, and, I am afraid, are very nearly humorless.  Adam Dalgliesh's gloom can get rather oppressive, and I was often moved to suggest that he get some Prozac.<br />The Skull Beneath The Skin, however, is the exception to the rule.  Dalgliesh is nowhere in sight.  James brings her other creation to the forefront, a woman named Cordelia Gray, last seen in James' An Unsuitable Job For A Woman.  Cordelia runs her own detective agency, and at the start of the novel is hired to protect a neurotic actress from a series of poison-pen letters during an upcoming amateur theatrical production to take place on a secluded island.<br />James seems to be taking on the classic murder mystery, complete with despicable victim, exotic locale, small number of suspects each equipped with a motive, and finally, a rather bizarre murder weapon.  The story moves swiftly and entertainingly, the characters live on the page, and if the denouement is rather unsatisfying, well, I think that is very much the point that James is making.  Those classic whodunits are not about life, they are more about creating a puzzle for the reader to solve.  James, however, wants to make us think about the realities of her situations, and to see her characters as living people, not just as cardboard types.  In this book she James takes the genre out for a ride, and manages to have some good mean fun with it.	2001-03-22

They took a grimly funny novel about a group of predatory monsters and turned it into a series of light comedies.  As splendid as William Powell and Myrna Loy are, they cannot hold a candle to  the Nick and Nora portrayed in this novel.<br />Hammett did not write a novel  about a sophisticated couple who genteelly solve a murder while pouring  cocktails and trading quips.  He wrote a dark novel about an ex-detective  who has married a wildly wealthy woman, and wants to spend the rest of his  life managing her money.  He is only faintly connected to the murders,  having known the victim and his family briefly several years before, and  wants nothing to do with the whole business.  He is continually dragged in,  however, and very nearly becomes a victim himself.  Even a cursory reading  of the novel should demonstrate that Hammett was up to much more than a  series of one-liners with detective interruptions.  Why else would Hammett,  one of the most economical of authors, bring the novel to a halt to include  a case history of Alfred Packer, the only American convicted of the crime  of cannibalism?<br />There is much more here than Hollywood, or anyone else  that I know of, has yet realized.	1999-07-07

The pretentiousness, the over-writing for the sake  of filling up pages, the too cute characters (If Tom Cullen had told me  that M-O-O-N spelled anything again, I was going to throw the book across  the room!), and a delusion that he has Something Serious To Say About The  Struggle Between Good And Evil.<br />The sad thing is that King really does  have something serious to say about the struggle between good and evil.

My heart goes out to all those who found to their disappointment that Thomas Harris has a mind of his own, and decided to write the book that HE wanted to write, rather than pandering to the wants of his fans.  <br />Folks.   Please remember.  This is the man who wrote Red Dragon, and The Silence Of  The Lambs.  Few authors living have his grasp of the thriller genre, can  create fascinating villains and inventive situations as intelligently as he  can.  Based on past evidence, Harris knows exactly what he is doing.  If  this book is unusual, it follows that it is unusual for a reason.  Harris  must have known that this novel would excite much controversy, and would  not necessarily be popular with the horror fan whose idea of literature is  Dean Koontz or John Saul.  So we have to ask ourselves WHY?  Why has Thomas  Harris written this book, and what might he be trying to tell  us?<br />Remember, people were similarly upset by Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo,  and later by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.  Both films were critically  maligned upon their initial release, only to be hailed as classics long  after better-received, more deliberately popular works were forgotten.<br />I  found the book to be gripping, disturbing, rather nauseating, and often  grimly funny.  I found the ending entirely appropriate, indeed the only  possible ending for these characters.  So they live happily ever after.   Did you expect something different?  If the American public insists upon  romanticizing homicidal maniacs, we shouldn't blame Thomas Harris for  rubbing our faces in it.	1999-06-15

For example,  Mr. Russo gets one crucial element of the plot of the Rocky Horror Picture  Show wrong, and then proceeds to make assorted assertions based on this  mistake.

No mere synopsis can do justice to the delirious plot, but suffice it to say that Ripley gets to show both his paternal side, and his maternal side.

This is the book that Stephen King has been trying to write since the Stand (that over-heavy over-long waste of paper).  All of the elements come together--Fear, Wonder, Delight, Joy, Terror, all mixed into a glorious and  very intelligent tale.  Read it.  Read it now.  You will be glad you did.	1999-02-01
