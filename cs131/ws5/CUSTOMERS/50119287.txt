The authors actually make it easy to create and maintain these reports.<br /><br />By using a story of a 5-year old who creates a lemonade stand, and later a consulting firm that teaches other entreprenuers how to build a net profit, this book also considers both the entrenuers who sell products and those who sell services.  Many, if not most accounting books do not explore the differences between financially managing a service-based business, versus a product-based business.<br /><br />Whether you are an accountant, a start up business owner, an established business owner, or an aspiring entreprenuer, READ THIS BOOK.	2005-10-07

The Jews' allegiance to Jewish laws, Jewish peoplehood, and<br />  the belief that the Jews are God's chosen people.<br /><br />2. Ethical monothesism (believing that the Jews are the people<br />  to bring the world God and His moral law.<br /><br />3. Attempts to change the world, to challenge the gods,<br />  religious or secular, of the societies around them, and to<br />  make moral demands upon others.<br /><br />4. As a result of the Jews'commitment to Judaism, they have led<br />  a higher-quality of life than their non-Jewish neighbors in<br />  almost every society where they have lived.<br /><br />Of the 5 proposed remedies, only the first and the last one seemed like possible solutions:<br /><br />1. Assimilation (Finding similarities, while co-existing, goes<br />  a very long way).<br /><br />2. Zionism (this would mean leaving, again)<br /><br />3. Seek converts (this would mean that you have to invest more<br />  time convincing others to believe what you believe, rather<br />  than just believing what you believe, and being an example)<br /><br />4. Use force to supress attacks against Jews (Anyone force into<br />  an opinion will always maintain their opinion, and this will<br />  fuel endless fights, on many levels).<br /><br />5. Education in ethical behavior (This provides options,<br />  allowing others to choose on their own terms).	2005-10-05

And yet, this did not give him the answers to the questions that he was seeking.<br /><br />To leave this new community, he again used his mastery over the skills that this group lived by, particularly to assert what you will do by silently, yet warmly looking your interlocutor in the eyes, allowing your interlocutor's internal dialogues to force him/her to be react.<br /><br />This led Siddhartha to find Buddha. And during this part of his life's journey, Siddhartha realized that he needs to leave all doctrines and all teachings because Buddha's wisdom and secret was not teachable, expressible, nor was it communicable.<br /><br />Siddhartha learned that he must be his own pupil - that this will provide the wisdom that he sought.<br /><br />The next step along his salvation journey was when he met a courtesan, named Kamala.<br /><br />When Kamala asked Siddhartha what he had to offer her, he said, \\"I know how to think, wait and to fast.\\"  To which she replied, \\"You must do what you have learned and obtain money, clothes and shoes for it.\\"<br /><br />They became lovers: She taught him her art (benefits of love-making), and he taught her his own art (benefits of thinking, waiting and fasting).<br /><br />At this stage in his journey she remained a teacher, but he sought more wisdom from life.<br /><br />It was when he chose to live as a ferryboat man, as he allowed himself to experience a range of emotions, in relation to all around the river, that Siddhartha learned that salvation and wisdom come when one experiences everything on a intellectual basis, as well as in one's eyes, heart, and stomach.<br /><br />This is an easy, fast-read that will touch your heart - no matter where you are on your life's journey.es everything on a intellectual basis, as well as in one's eyes, heart, and stomach.

That's my evil twin!\\"<br /><br />Jerry Weissman, former producer for Mike Wallace, and now presentation coach to top executives at Yahoo!, eBay, Intel, Intuit, Cisco Systems, Microsoft, and many others, encourages presenters to use martial art philosophies, during the Q&A portion of your presentation.  Readers of this new book will control the: question, the answer, the questioner, the audience, the time and yourself.<br /><br />And their audience will decide that they are reliable, in charge, competent, a worthy investment, and sincerely in rapport with each person who asks you a question.<br /><br />Example From This Book:<br /><br />During the October 15, 1992, presidential debate, between George H. Bush, Ross Perot and Bill Clinton, Marisa Hall, a twenty-six year-old, African-American woman in the audience asked the famous question, \\"... How has the national debt personally affected each of your lives?\\"<br /><br />As she asked this question, George H. Bush was caught on camera looking at his wristwatch.  His verbalized answer was \\"Well, I think the national debt affects everybody.  Obviously ...\\"<br /><br />And she followed this with, \\"You personally.\\"<br /><br />This, as the author describes, was the beginning of the chain of events that kept George H. Bush from being re-elected.  Not only was his body language communicating impatience, he also demonstrated, by saying, \\"everybody\\" that he wasn't listening to Marisa Hall's question.<br /><br />George H. Bush didn't listen for the key issue, but instead dump words out of his busy mind.  He failed to allow himself to be fully in the moment, to demonstrate that the questioner is the most important person to him - at that moment.<br /><br />What George H. Bush could have done was to master what the author demonstrates that Colin Powell and General Schwarzkopf have mastered - begin the answer with a key word(s) that provides benefits to the questioner, and avoids media sound bites that distort your message.<br /><br />A better answer would have been, \\"While I don't make mortgage payments and car payments myself, I can still use the power of my office to help people impacted by the economy.\\"<br /><br />This answer acknowledges Marisa Hall's underlying question and shows that she matters. Providing more detail would be a set up for failure, as it is important to make thorough answers as close to 5 seconds as possible.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed this book from beginning to the last page, because being human is means developing communication skills that allow us to be more effective.<br /><br />The biggest benefit that I gained from this book was in preparation for an event that called for my having to answer many questions to someone who made up her mind before I opened my mouth.  I prepared and was successful, because I wrote out 100 questions in one sitting, in anticipation of this event- as the author advises./> <br />What George H.

And most who have read earlier versions have read the 1960 edition.<br /><br />I was introduced to the 1960 edition during an Anthony Robbins seminar, many years ago.  And I must say that I had evolved so much while reading that earlier edition that reading Ross Cornwell's restored and revised edition led me to look more closely for what is different about a book that had guided me many years ago to evolve in ways that were beyond anyone's wildest dreams.<br /><br />How this restored and revised edition is different:<br /><br />1. Appendices (Hill's bio, tributes and other work)<br /><br />2. Easily accessible endnotes that explain more about Napoleon Hill and those who influenced this success philosophy<br /><br />3. Changed some words throughout book, for clarity<br /><br />\\"Think and Grow Rich\\" is a 13-step process to success and riches.  It is also a philosophy of individual achievement that guides readers to \\"follow what you demand of life.\\"<br /><br />To this day, my favorite example in this book of how money can be made is the after-dinner speech presented by Charles M. Schwab to John Pierpont Morgan.<br /><br />In this speech, and all that followed to the close of the deal, there are lessons of determination, persistence, unspoken corporate political rules and other power games that  led to the United States Steel Corporation to be born when everyone thought it couldn't be done.<br /><br />And my two favorite quotes from this book are:<br /><br />\\"You are the master of your fate, the captain of your soul.\\"  And, \\"You are never ready for a thing until you believe you can acquire it.\\"	2005-05-08

Even though the book is a pretty good size, Archer has so developed the characters and the plot that one can't help but to read it quickly.<br /><br />Archer is an excellent story teller who truly develops his characters, and allows the reader to be there, ever step of the way.<br /><br />\\"As The Crow Flies,\\" is a story of Charlie Trumper, a barrow boy who at a very tender age of 8 had big dreams, despite his humble beginnings.  And, though his life took many challenging turns, Charlie held onto his vision, and made it a reality for himself and those who stuck by his side.<br /><br />This is a rags to riches story.  It's also a story about tragedy, courage and triumph.<br /><br />When Charlie went off to war, he met an enemy, Guy Trentham, who also was from London, except he came from wealthy beginnings.  And he was one who believed that there was no room for others to be successful.<br /><br />At every step, Trentham did his best to sabotage Charlie's good work, yet Charlie, keeping counsel with himself, rose above Trentham's evil doings.<br /><br />And once both of these soldiers were back home, Trentham nourished and preserved his envy to the point that he enlisted his mother into his schemes against Charlie.<br /><br />Yet, when Charlie returned home from the war he resumed his commitment to grow his business.<br /><br />And in the end, despite the Trentham evil intentions, Charlie, along with his beloved friends, managed to trump the Trentham's evil deeds.<br /><br />Charlie also became one of the most prominent people in London.	2005-04-21

This is better than the books on this same subject that preceded it, because there is substance.  And Catherine takes the readers on a very detailed journey of the investigation, and through the penalty hearing.<br /><br />I chose to read this because I wanted to know what was different from the detailed televised interviews and printed media.<br /><br />The Scott Peterson case represents problems in how many people are too busy living their lives, without being connected enough with others - they have forgotten the importance of earning one another's trust, during each interaction.<br /><br />The deadly game that Scott defined himself by, and everyone in his life bought into, was the ability to disown his emotions and his thoughts in a way that forces others to perceive him as being more of what they lacked.<br /><br />And as the investigation developed, Scott was confronted with parts of himself that he had spent his entire life disowning.  His reaction was always to lie, and to try to force his interlocutors to question themselves.<br /><br />When you put a salesperson up against seasoned police detectives the deadly game can no longer be played, because generally speaking, cops are experts in reading everyone who they come into contact with - their careers depend upon this.<br /><br />It was also great to read from this book about many details about Laci Peterson's habits and expectations.<br /><br />For those who still claim that there was no evidence, I invite you to read this book, and be honest about the thoughts that rise up from within yourself.<br /><br />It's easy to actually chart reasons why he is guilty as you read this book.	2005-03-29

The middle class at other environments talk about the raise.  And the poor talk about making it.<br /><br />One of the most hilarious parts to this book is the example of what happens when someone says, \\"Oh!  Money is not that important.\\"<br /><br />T. Harv Eker's reaction is to tap the palm of his hand on his forehead as he say's, \\"Oh!  I get it.  You're broke!\\"<br /><br />To do this, without regard for whose around and what the social situation is, would definitely be life altering for the person who says that money is not important. (I actually can't imagine someone doing this in any situation other than if they are presenting a motivational workshop, where they are in charge.<br /><br />But, nonetheless, imagining this happening was funny.<br /><br />Beyond humor, this book compares the rich to the poor with these assertions:<br /><br />1. Rich people believe \\"I create my life.\\"  Poor people<br /><br />  believe, \\"Life happens to me.\\"<br /><br />2. Rich people play the money game to win.

You have a quiet power.\\"<br /><br />They hadn't read this book.<br /><br />While many may think that this is about manipulation, or other mean-spirited choices, I'd say it's about socialization.<br /><br />As human beings we make decisions every second that are largely based upon our interactions with others.<br /><br />We think what we think, and feel what we feel based upon our interactions with other human beings.

We also have many choices to make, on a continual basis.<br /><br />As someone who has studied loves studying verbal judo, I was impressed by the new things that I learned from this book.<br /><br />Though there are many lessons that I gleamed from this book, this review describes author's five essential skills for radical collaboration.<br /><br />The five essential skills to overcome defensiveness; and to build successful relationships are:<br /><br />1. Collaborative Intention;<br /><br />This is recognizing how we all, even those of us who are perceived to be strong, have defensive habits.<br /><br />To arrive at this, it's important that you are fully in the present moment. And you've checked your ego at the door.<br /><br />Many will say, \\"I can't acknowledge that person's attributes, when I disagree.\\"<br /><br />But, if you want what you want, and you intend to get it, you must accept that recognizing and sincerely acknowledging your interlocutor's attributes will inspire him or her to work with you on finding a solution that is mutually beneficial.<br /><br />Remember that this experience is not your entire life - it's just an experience.<br /><br />2. Truthfulness;<br /><br />This is looking inside yourself, accepting what is, and being visible to your interlocutor.<br /><br />Admit how you teach your opponent, or interlocutor to push just the right button, to make you think and feel the worst.<br /><br />And in so doing, you will inspire collaboration, first within yourself, then with others.<br /><br />3. Self-Accountability;<br /><br />This is making habitual, conscious choices in your life, and taking responsibility for the results of your choices.<br /><br />I recently was challenged with this with someone who is a senior, who has been somewhat of a surrogate mom.<br /><br />For everything that I said, this senior woman kept saying things that bugged me.<br /><br />And though I normally speak up in the present moment, this experience taught me that she was showing me my weaknesses.

I'm shocked that she used Laci Peterson's , and the Rocha's pictures, on the jacket of this book.<br /><br />The sentences and paragraph developments do not flow.<br /><br />The questions that I still have on this topic are:<br /><br />What kind of a best friend would, after finding out that Scott Peterson was married and is a liar, call him, before calling the best friend, and give him room to \\"come clean with her best friend?\\"<br /><br />What kind of behind the scenes deal did Amber Frey and Gloria Allred make with the media, given that it appears that Matt Lauer, Oprah and you have no respect for Amber Frey.  It's seems that you all have done these interviews as a favor for someone.<br /><br />Why has no one asked Amber Frey what her commitment is to changing emotionally and psychologically?  Obviously religion, albeit it has its value, is not the solution.<br /><br />Though the book jacket says that this book is a story of how a young woman becamse ensnared in Scott Peterson's web of lies, then risked everything to seek justice for Laci Peterson and her unborn child, Conner, I'd say that this is a book about what happens when women put looking for a Prince Charming before looking for someone who earns their trust.<br /><br />[...]<br />Also, if Amber Frey were really trying to get on with her life, and to turn a tragedy into many blessings, wouldn't she invest more time in healing her soul, than in telling the world that she chooses to still be a victim?	2005-01-14

I know more than he knows. And it's time for me to be my own boss.\\"<br /><br />Well, I must admit that based upon, \\"Mastery: The Keys to Success and Long-Term Fulfillment,\\" by George Leonard, my mind and heart were truly ready to take on \\"Michael Gerber's \\"E-Myth Mastery.\\"<br /><br />Mastery of anything is finding a way to both enjoy and make easy what is before you. It is also choosing to not arrive at a destination, but instead to really be on a journey, while you enjoy even the plateaus.<br /><br />And, \\"The E-Myth Mastery,\\" is about creating and developing what the author calls a World-Class Company, through becoming an entrepreneur, rather than a manager or a technician. The true entrepreneur has vision and zest for what is to come.<br /><br />An entrepreneur does not arrive at a destiny, but instead embraces an endless journey, anticipating obstacles, and creating systems that overcome those obstacles.<br /><br />In a style that invites the serious reader to discover answers to questions that rise up from within ones self, Michael Gerber provides the tools, ideas, insight, methods and systems to inspire any small business owner to make entrepreneurship into a way of life for both yourself and those around you.<br /><br />This is important because to develop any business the entrepreneur must continually grow, as she or surrounds herself with people who mirror and match her goals, vision and mission.<br /><br />In addition to suggesting that entrepreneurs surround themselves with those who help them to realize their dreams, Gerber suggests that readers do much like Napoleon Hill, in \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" suggests by selecting who to emulate.<br /><br />It's also important for the entrepreneur to ask what is working and how you know this the answer to this question.<br /><br />Gerber guides readers further in their quest for answers, by recommending that they ask themselves, \\"What is it that Sam Walton knew that I need to know? What is it that I need to practice?\\"<br /><br />When I asked myself these questions, and made the commitment to write in my notebook whatever came to mind, I was amazed, because I know that the ideas and possibilities that I wrote down would not have occurred to me, had I not been guided to explore the answers within myself, and document those answers.<br /><br />Writing the answers down allowed me to see something that I will remember and take action on.<br /><br />And as a life-time student of human behavior, section two is where I really sat up and took notice. Though my original plan in reading this book was to just to read without becoming deeply involved in it, I couldn't help but to take copious notes. With pencil in hand, and a 3-ring binder in hand, full of blank pages I did not want to miss details that would my memory probably not hold. I was guided into the depths of my journey, searching for all the \\"Wows\\" that I could find.<br /><br />Being one who is more interested in having a conversation with the author, through reading, than being a fast reader, I caught myself saying, \\"Oh!

US	50119287	R26K9O4FVWV0P0	0060731583	486983213	AMERICAN SOLDIER	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Down Home Troubled Boy Becomes Military Leader	I was drawn to this book as I watched General Tommy Franks' willingness to sing off key during his \\"Good Morning America\\" interview with Diane Sawyer.<br /><br />As an army veteran who has left the military in the 80's, I also wanted to read this book to understand something about the post-cold war army.<br /><br />This is a good book on many fronts.  It begins with many details about General Tommy Franks' upbringing, more details than you might expect from someone in his position to reveal; but, certainly not too much.<br /><br />He was adopted and raised in both Oklahoma and Texas.  He describes his parents as \\"ignorant,\\" \\"not evil,\\" when they generalized about Negroes.<br /><br />As I read that, I could almost feel this experience from a slightly different perspective.<br /><br />His father also worked one job after another.  And there was a great deal of financial hardship in his upbringing.<br /><br />When he did get into college, he focused more on girls, beer, and shooting the breeze, than studying - until he was on scholastic probation, and suspended for six months.<br /><br />After being kicked out of college, Franks enlisted in the army.  But it when someone mistaken him for being an officer, after just nine months as an enlisted man, that Franks realized that he was destined to become an officer.<br /><br />And during his interview for Officer's Candidate School, Franks was told that he is not officer material.  He stayed mad for three months, then he got fed up with this, and found his way into Officer's Candidate School.<br /><br />It's interesting to note that he finally arrived at a point that the person who tried to make him give up on his dreams was really paying him a disguised compliment.  This drove him to prove himself, over and over again.<br /><br />Franks' officer's training started off in artillery, which the army calls the \\"King of Battle.\\"  He actually graduated as a \\"distinguished military graduate,\\" demonstrating that it's not what someone else thinks of you.  It's how you project yourself along your path of self-mastery.<br /><br />And because of his dedication and success, the army, as it often does, paid for Franks to complete his college, in exchange for his giving the army more of his time.<br /><br />Later in this memoir, it's interesting to note that by the time General Franks become the head of CENTCOM, which is responsible for 25 countries (from Kenya and Horn of Africa, north through the deserts of Sudan, Egypt and Jordan, across the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf, through Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan and the former Soviet Stans).  This area is what Franks' CENTCOM predecessor described as a \\"dangerous neighborhood.\\"<br /><br />What I was concerned about was that General Franks seemed to put a strong light on the idea that he was supportive of African-Americans.  One example was when Franks and his enlisted buddy lost their money, and as Franks describes \\"The black elevator operator\\" gave them a five-dollar bill.<br /><br />Other points that piqued my interest about this book were how he made learning about the military maneuvers in Vietnam interesting, by having maps in the right places, and by using just enough of the believable colloquialism that you are there, and safe, at the same time.<br /><br />Reading this memoir, it was great to learn of how technology had changed military priorities.  It was also great to read more about what Franks believes that various leaders think about other countries.<br /><br />And when he offered this information he did so in a conversational, down home manner that makes it believable.<br /><br />I wondered though why Franks needed to tell his readers that he was helped by a \\"black elevator operator.\\"  Is he trying to make amends for past wrong doing?  Wouldn't it have been enough to just say that someone believed in him enough to give him that five-dollar bill, after he and his buddy lost their money?<br /><br />Franks also seemed to have been trying to impress men when he told about how he met Rachel Welch, when he was injured and how he met her in more recent years.<br /><br />I also wondered and didn't learn from this memoir what his relationship was with Colin Powell, other than their disagreement about troop force size and support of that force.  Actually, in this memoir, Franks seems to believe that \\"He earned his right to an opinion, but had relinquished responsibility as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1993,\\" he was basically saying, \\"Thanks, but you're not qualified to make this decision.\\"<br /><br />With this information, General Tommy Franks gives us another slice of history, an explanation of why the military has changed a great deal, and how Tommy Franks converted a troubled past into a love of commanding respect.<br /><br />This book could be used by those who study military strategies, global history and military socialization.<br /><br />It's worth reading, and honing in on the mindset of today's military - regardless of whether or not you believe we should be at war.>Franks also seemed to have been trying to impress men when he told about how he met Rachel Welch, when he was injured and how he met her in more recent years.   <br /> <br />I also wondered and didn't learn from this memoir what his relationship was with Colin Powell, other than their disagreement about troop force size and support of that force.

Show No Fear<br />This does not mean avoid or deny it.  Recognize it, process it, and choose to breath your way to being confident.  See fear as you inner self telling you that you are about to stretch your self-definition, in the face of others, and that there will be resistance.  Read, \\"Fear of Flying,\\" by Erica Jong.<br /><br />2.  Believe in the Value of What You Are Selling<br />It's not the sell that you are after.  It's the benefits that you are bringing to your buyer.  It is also the ability to be influential.  Read \\"People Power,\\" by Donna Fisher.<br /><br />3.  Use Your Errors To Your Advantage<br />Remember, a mistake is not your entire identity - it's a sign of where you can enhance your inner self-image.<br /><br />4.  Use Power Phrases<br />An example is, \\"Here's how we'll get started.\\"  Read \\"Verbal Judo,\\" by George Thompson, Ph.D.<br /><br />5.  Desire to Close Sales Means More Than Anything Else<br />You don't have to like the person.  You are there to influence change in that person's life.<br /><br />6.  Take Objections as \\"No Big Deal\\"<br />The stronger the objection, the more your prospect is giving you, about him or her.  Use this to compassionately respond to his or her needs.  Stay in the moment.  Take your time.  And show your prospect that he or she matters.  Read, \\"Honoring the Self,\\" by Nathaniel Branden, Ph.D.<br /><br />7.  Recognize Your Prospect's Resistance as Helpful For the Sell<br />When you see, feel and hear that resistance, you know if this is a serious prospect.  And if this is a serious prospect, their resistance tells you the questions that you must answer, for them to buy what you are sellng.<br /><br />8.  Deflect Negative Influences<br />If you invest your valuable time around people with bad attitudes, you will adopt this in your attitude, and it will reflect in your sells calls.  Surround yourself amongst people who are free to be negative in a positive way, who also are optimistic.  (Pointing out, and processing realities allows room for change). Read, \\"Unlimited Power,\\" by Tony Robbins.<br /><br />9.  Be Competitive, yet Stress-Free<br />Read \\"Mastery,\\" by George Leonard.<br /><br />10. Celebrate Your Success<br />Think back, before your sells calls, of times when you have sold ideas, services, or products.  Create a movie in your mind, of what happened before, during and after these successes.  See this vividly.  Identify as many details as possible.  Then use this as an anchor, each time you prepare to make sells calls.  Remembering these movies in your mind will condition you to be success now.

And I believe that this continues throughout women's lives, if they continue to place societal and mother/daughter expectations before listening to their inner selves.<br /><br />Girls and women put such a high price on their self-esteem, based upon pleasing their friends, that often, if they were to slow down, and truly think about what a friendship freely gives:  A commitment to tell the other what you think, judge, feel, value, love, honor, hate, fear, desire, hope for, believe in, and are committed to - without reprisal, they would see that they have spent their lives making soul bribes, based upon unspoken rules about disowning yourselves.<br />Another interesting point is that girls and women often say that guys don't have true friends, because many guys based their friendships upon whether or not they do some activity, such as play golf together, from time to time.  The complaint comes from the fact that these guys don't get into one another's psyche.  And many wouldn't know if the other is having marital problems.<br />Women and girls spend so much time pushing boys and mean to process their emotions and say what they mean, when in fact, if we were to look at how females act amongst one another, without the boys around, we would have to admit that most women and girls spend an incredible amount of time walking on egg shells around one another.  Yes.  There is a great deal of bounding that goes on.  But, when their is a problem, do we talk about it to the point that we fully process it, int the presence of our friends?  Or, do we minimize it, and change the subject, choking off our feelings, because we decide that we want too much?<br />By 8 years old, we are socialized into the identity of disowning our authentic selves.  And with this bargain, we set ourselves and future generations of girls up for self-destructive behavior.<br />When it comes down to it, girls and women, or anyone who is willing to:  give others the silent treatment; exclude others, without a discussion of why; give mean looks; gossip; or, gang up on a girl, can we say that we are any better off?<br />I am so glad that there are books like this book.  And I hope that mothers and daughters will read this together - followed by ongoing dialogues, and meeting with other mothers and daughters.<br />Imagine a world where girls and women no longer worry about what one another thinks.  Imagine the possibility of girls and women being able to say to one another, \\"I feel angry when someone does ...  I would prefer that you ...\\"<br />This takes practice, and acceptance of all that could happen.

From an adult view, it is both a warning of how one is measured by those in power, and it is something that is blindly passed on - not questioned, just accepted as fact, much like the unspoken messages that generation after generation mothers pass on to their daughters about their limitations.<br />I selected this book because I read, years ago, &quot;Migration of the Heart,&quot; and &quot;Skin Deep,&quot; by Ms. Golden.  And I continue to be moved by her written messages. She speaks to your soul!<br />As a child, I do remember conflicting messages of, &quot;Go outside and play,&quot; shortly followed by, &quot;If you stay in the sun too long you will be too black.&quot;<br />&quot;Too black&quot; in the 60's, during the Civil Rights Movement - at times when we were saying, &quot;Say it loud.  I'm black and I'm proud?&quot;<br />Yes.  It was a statement unconsciously spoken.  And it continues to be spoken, whites worry about the dangers of tanning salons, and blacks search for ways to &quot;blend in.&quot;<br />Another reason why I was drawn to this book is that Ms. Golden uses Zora Neale Hurston's (read &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God,&quot; and her other books)  messages from the first page, throught the book, to encourage change.<br />Thank you Ms. Golden, for telling your story, and for believing in your purpose, and for contributing to race relations being an inside job.	2004-05-23

Truth Creates Money - Lies Destroy Money:<br />This means opening your bills, while you allow whatever negative emotion to well up from within you, as you allow yourself to compassionately respond to that emotion.<br />2. Look at What You Have - Not at What You Had:<br />If you always focus upon what you had, you will recreate every painful experience from your past.  And you will repell money.<br />Write a gratitude journal.  And anytime that you say to yourself, &quot;I don't have ...,&quot;  follow this with, &quot;And I do have this,&quot; several times, as you breath full relaxed breaths.  You will attract what you need and want.<br />3.  Do What Is Right For You - Before You Do What Is Right For Your Money:<br />Don't allow debt, money, or other material symbols to control you.  Create money to express your self-love.<br />4.  Invest In The Known - Before The Unknown:<br />What are are you clear about? Why?  Could you become curious, interested and therefore savvy on other potential investments?<br />Before you invest in the known, create a vision of yourself making and appreciating that investment.<br />5.  Money Has No Power of Its Own - Unless You Give It Power Over Your Life:<br />When you decide that money has power over you, you will repell it. Money is just notes, with deceased people on each note.  Money creates options, for you, and those who you believe in.	2004-05-21

They're just jealous.  Give them time.  They will come around, 'Do you question your sanity?'\\"<br />And, isn't this another way of telling you that you are flawed, that you should feel ashamed of yourself, and that you need to give up being who you are - or else?\\"<br />\\"Odd Girl Speaks Out,\\" is a wonderful book, written with 11-22 year-old girls in mind.  But, every woman can get something out of this, because by age 8, and for the rest of our lives, we are socialized with these 3 unspoken rules:<br />1.  Don't Compete;<br />2.  Don't Outdo; and,<br />3.  Make the guys more valuable to you, than girls could possibly be.<br />We are also socialized to not directly confront conflict, especially with other girls.<br />And we learn, at an early age, to base our worthiness upon hanging onto our best girlfriends, at the price of our own worthiness.<br />I'm so glad to have read this book, because each letter, written by the 11-22 year-old contributors, reminds us that Girl Power is not about seeking legislative rights, although I wouldn't want to reverse what our foremothers have given us.<br />Girl Power also is not about blaming men for what we haven't succinctly communicated to them.<br />Girl Power is about facing the reality of the darker side of being girls.  It is where we stop seeking targets in other women/girls, to make them look worse than we feel about ourselves.  Allgirls are socialized to believe that power for girls is limited, and that if the other girl has it, she has taken away all the possibility for her to have power.<br />What troubled me, though, about this book were 2 things:<br />1.  Never did the author explore how girl bullying is passed on between the mother/daughter wounds, and the decisions that mother make about what society expects of them.<br />2.  Throughout this book, Simmons advocates girls changing schools when things are overwhelmingly difficult.  The problem with this is:  You are leaving with yourself.  Whatever wound you have, whatever disempowering habit you created in reaction to being attacked is something that you will express at the new school, until you overcome your fears, and develop  skills to defuse and deflect negative energy that is coming towards you, from others.<br />That being said, I still appreciate reading this book, and knowing that Simmons is brave enough to turn her own experiences into helping millions of others around the world.r wound you have, whatever disempowering habit you created in reaction to being attacked is something that you will express at the new school, until you overcome your fears, and develop  skills to defuse and deflect negative energy that is coming towards you, from others.<br />That being said, I still appreciate reading this book, and knowing that Simmons is brave enough to turn her own experiences into helping millions of others around the world.	2004-04-20

A New Understanding of Guilt and Forgiveness	Books	5	31	36	N	N	Bless Your Imperfections	I don't know if it is because I've read 3 other books by Rabbi Kushner, or because from the first words to the last words reading this book I feel like I am having a conversation with him.  This includes many questions about life, the human condition, and religion that I have carried with me for a long time.<br />If someone had mentioned religion, God, or related words to me before discovering both Rabbi Kushner, and Dennis Prager, I would have been ready to bolt for the nearest door, because that had signaled what I called &quot;Bible-thumpin time.&quot;<br />So, no matter where you stand on religion, politics, or the human condition, I invite you to open your mind to the possibility of forgiveness.<br />With the subtitle being &quot;A New Understanding of Guilt and Forgiveness,&quot; it's nice to notice that throughout this book Kushner discusses many examples of what guilt has been for us.<br />He uses &quot;The Original Sin;&quot; &quot;Paradise Lost;&quot; and many other stories that show how we have interpreted God's expectations of us to mean that we are born sinners who must become perfect.  Which of course is not, as he points out, God's expectations of us.<br />Kushner adds, &quot;My experiences as a clergyman and a counselor has taught me that much of the unhappiness people feel burdened by, much of the guilt, much of the sense of having been cheated by life, stems from one of two related causes:  either somewhere along the way, somebody - a parent, a teacher, a religious leader - gave them the message that they were not good enough, and they believed it.  Or else they came to expect and need more from the people around them --- their parents, children, husbands, or wives - than those people could realistically deliver.&quot;<br />His suggestion is that the story of the Garden of Eden is the story of the first human beings graduating from the uncomplicated world to knowinging that good and evil exists; and that what is most important to us, as human beings is to live with integrity.<br />This book also suggests that if Adam and Eve had not eaten from the Tree of Knowledge, they would not have had needs, feelings, or individual thoughts.  So, it would not have mattered what happened around them.<br />A year ago, I asked a prominent religious leader in San Diego, &quot;Do you believe that the active members of your church know what religion means to them - not your interpretation, theirs?&quot;<br />This got his attention, and began a great collaboration.<br />Religion, as Rabbi Kushner describes in this book is, &quot;... the voice that says, I will guide you through this minefield of difficult moral choices, sharing with you the insights and experiences of the greatest souls of the past, and I will offer you comfort and forgiveness when you are troubled by the painful choices you made.&quot;<br />Imagine if millions are guided by Rabbi Kushner's definition of religion - wouldn't we be more accepting of unique differences?<br />Wouldn't we accept our limitations - and, by accepting them, evolve beyond our wildest dreams?<br />Wouldn't we simultaneously be enough, while we win more than we lose?<br />And wouldn't we laugh more?s is to live with integrity.<br />This book also suggests that if Adam and Eve had not eaten from the Tree of Knowledge, they would not have had needs, feelings, or individual thoughts.

The Two Voices of God<br />  To be good and to matter.<br /><br />2.  How to Win By Losing<br />  \\"When we defeat the still small voice of God inside us, we lose.\\"  The lesson here is to face your \\"fire-blowing dragons in life,\\" knowing that there are lessons for you in doing so.  Ride out your pain, knowing that you are weeding outyour garden, and preparing to plant sucess, love and happiness seeds in the garden of your mind.<br /><br />3.  What kind of Person Do You Want To Be?<br />  In this chapter there were 2 places in which I disagree with Rabbi Kushner: One, he describes a person, on page 38, who did some horrible things are being, \\"a good man tormented by urges he knew were wrong but could not control.\\"  And the other place, on page 39, he say's, \\"It may be that some people are born without the ability to develop a fully functioning conscience, in the same way that some people are born ith a malfunctioning limb or organ or lacking an enzyme that is necessary for normal life.\\"<br /><br />Wouldn't recognition of someone's short-comings, and loving support around this person solve these problems?<br /><br />Muh.  Questions and thoughts to ponder for some time.<br /><br />An excellent point in this chapter is that to be human is to never stop asking ourselves, \\"What kind of person do I want to be?\\"<br /><br />As we ask this question, it becomes easy to endlessly grow, and to see a reflection of our love in others.<br /><br />4.  Wild Justice:  The Seducive Pleasure of Getting Even<br />  \\"The ambivalence in getting even is that our consciences condemn it even as  souls crave it.\\"<br /><br />  The challenge of revenge and mattering are beautifully explored in this chapter.  The solution can only come from within yourself.<br /><br />5.  Shalom: The Quest for Integrity<br />  Becoming a person of integrity occurs when you surrender to life, on life's terms.<br /><br />6.  Family and Friends:  We are Who We Love<br />  Questions that are explored in this chapter are:<br />  Where am I going with my life?<br />  What kind of person will I grow up to be?<br />  What is the point of falling in love?<br />  What are genuine friendships?<br />  Where is God?<br /><br />7.

My mother was basically a Democrat, although she kept it quiet in Republican Park Ridge.  My dad was a rock-ribbed, up-by-your-bootstraps, conservative Republican and proud of it....My father could not stand personal waste ... If one of my brothers or I forgot to screw the cap back on the toothpast tube, my father threw it out the bathroom window... To this day, I put uneaten olives back in the jar, wrap up the tiniest pieces of cheese and feel guilty when I throw anything away... He was a tough taskmaster, but we knew he cared about us.\\"<br />Early in this book, I also got the impression that Ms. Clinton's perception of her mother's childhood and marriage led her to fear the consequences of a commitment, while it swept her up into the arms of a man who counts upon persuation, at the expense of others.<br />In part, my decision to think is came because Ms. Clinton says, \\"My mother had suffered from her parents' divorce, and her sad and lonely childhood was imprinted on my heart...  Looking back... I though of him [Bill Clinton] as a force of nature and wondered whethe4r I'd be up to thie task of living through his seasons.\\"<br />Translation:  She had unfinished business from her mother/daughter wounds (See Nancy Friday \\"My Mother/Myself) that had led her to marry Bill Clinton.<br />Of course she married a man whose childhood role model was an alcoholic, wife-beater.  She was driving by a narcissistic father.<br />And it is interesting that she says that her reasons why she stays will Bill Clinton are:  shared experiences; parenting; burying their parents; extended families; friendships that extend a lifespan; common faith; and, abiding commitment to the U.S.<br />Anyone could have shared the worst of experiences together.  But, that doesn't mean that they should, or need to continue to be together.<br />You can suffer a great loss together, as in burying your parents. And that represents a huge loss in your life.  But, when you recover, and redefine your life, without their physical presence, does this person belong in it still?  Are you the same person?<br />Common Faith?  Is this religion?  And if it is, God doesn't want you to be a slave to him, the almighty.<br />When this book first came out, I heard so many women saying, \\"What a role model she is!  She put up with so much.  And now she is telling us details behind her experience.\\"<br />I had to practice being a diplomatic listener, as I do believe that we all have a right to our own opinion.<br />My own opinion, before reading this book was that Hillary Rodham Clinton was not a role model for women.<br />After reading this book, with as open a mind as possible, I say that if you read this book, and think your own thoughts about her spin on her experiences, this book can be valuable in terms of healing wounds, claiming your right to be authentic, and getting on with your life.hared experiences; parenting; burying their parents; extended families; friendships that extend a lifespan; common faith; and, abiding commitment to the U.S.<br />Anyone could have shared the worst of experiences together.

And I reacted with, &quot;No.  I don't think so.&quot;<br />Internally, my reaction was, &quot;But you don't understand where I come from.  Nobody has experienced anything like this.&quot;<br />This internal reaction kept me unconsciously (psychically, if you will) beating up my parents and myself.  It was an agreement with myself.  Or, more appropriately, I nourished and preserved an excuse for my not reaching my potential.<br />I read this book in 1998.  This was nine years after I had made a commitment to myself to endlessly grow.<br />Some other books that helped me were, &quot;My Mother Myself,&quot; to understand my relationship with my mother.  And, John Bradshaw's, &quot;Family Secrets,&quot; to understand to unspoken truths.<br />Five years later, as I look at my life now, I am glad that I have made peace with my parents (They did the best that they knew how; and I love for that).<br />Recently someone whom I've known since 1976, but had lost contact with, said to me, &quot;Wow.  I'm glad I have a great family who is always here for me.&quot;<br />This was a wake up call for me, because I truly responded internally with, &quot;Wow!  I am glad that I had the experiences that I had.  I am also glad that I have made a commitment to use each of those experiences to enhance my self-image.  Without my parents, I wouldn't be all that I love about myself.&quot;<br />So, for those of you who fear reading a book that guides you to take responsibility for your life, congratulate yourself for recognizing your fear.  That can be the beginning of your choosing to be the best you possible - and loving that.	2004-02-03

The laws of nature<br />2.  Chaos<br />3.  An act of nature<br />4.  Human choices<br />5.  Self-punishment when things go wrong<br />6.  Accidents<br />7.  Expectations of others that can't be fulfilled<br />8.  Denial of emotional immaturity<br />9.  Our reactions to our own hurt and anger<br />This book teaches readers how to accept  any kind of loss as part of the human condition.<br />This book also tells us that God doesn't cause accidents, sickness or disasters.<br />When Adam and Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge, they chose to live a life of choices, as knowledge is about choices.  They were no longer in the category of animals.  And with those choices God gave humanity choices, feelings and a need to congregate with other human beings, to affirm who we are.<br />God is here to build strength, courage, and a sense of human connection - when we are ready to ask ourselves, \\"Now that this has happened, what am I going to do about it?\\"  And, \\"Whom does this suffering serve?\\"<br />\\"Let me sugggest that the bad things that happen to us in our lives do not have a meaning when they happen to us.  They do not happen for any good reason which would cause us to accept them willingly.  But we can give them a meaning.\\"<br />It is a book to be read over and over again, to become more  compassionate, as compassion is the language of God.	2003-12-03

This story explores what really happened in My Lai, 18 years prior to the date of this article.<br />Also, a book is about to be released, during the time that this story hits the news wires.  And Benjamin Tyson is suddenly faced with the conflict between his honor as a married man, who is prosperous, and looked up to by all, versus, his duties as a Platoon leader, 18 years prior.<br />He has no control over the perception that the reporter and author place on his past.<br />The army gets involved, because this is what they do, to save their bacon.  But, his wife decides that this is not what she bargained for, in marrying him.<br />And to maintain his sense of military honor, Tyson doesn't even tell his attorney the entire truth.<br />His platoon had sworn to never tell the world what they had done.<br />And the only person who could reveal enough details, to set Tyson free is someone who is not military, who was there, during this massacre.<br />This is a wonderful look at male psyche, military law, the power of the press, and what happens when one denies the painful past.<br />DeMille's books are excellent - I've read at least 10 of them.  And I place them in a league with Leon Uris and Jeffrey Archer.and Jeffrey Archer.	2003-11-23

When her father's store caught on fire, he desperately ran<br />  into the store to grab his cash register.  This caused him to<br />  be badly burned.  And it taught Suze Orman to learn about<br />  investments, savings and related topics.<br />2.  After college, she was a stock broker for Merrill Lynch.<br />  This is where she learned the difference between what was<br />  being told to the public, and what the truth about money is.<br />Through these events she discovered her life's work is telling people the truth about money.<br />Within this book Orman talks a lot about uncovering your money memories, and seeing where those money memories have led you to have the relationship to money that you now have.<br />She also covers many fundamental topics about retirement and investing in this book.  But she does not take readers through the journey of earning a dollar, to growing that dollar into several millions - or to allowing that money to work for you.<br />I'd suggest that you read these seven books, after reading &quot;Nine Steps to Financial Freedom&quot;:<br />1. &quot;More Wealth Without Risk,&quot; by Charles Givens<br />2. &quot;Financial Self-Defense,&quot; by Charles Givens<br />3. &quot;The Millionaire Next Door,&quot; by Thomas J.

As usual, when I am reading a book, I walk around with that book, along with something to write with, and on.<br />There was a stranger who came up to me and looked at me with both sadness and pity in her eyes.<br />She asked me, &quot;Is this really a problem for you?&quot;<br />Anyone who would ask this question, and especially to a stranger, in my opinion, probably is in denial of his or her need for greater self-expression - this is what this book is about.<br />Who wouldn't be looking to be a better listener; more compassionate; and fully in this moment?<br />We are all bombarded with social scripts; childhood expectations; and unfinished past business.<br />And we deserve to be more alive, more fully in the present moment, regardless of our interlocutor's beliefs.<br />As we grow, we search for greater peace of mind, while we experience new &quot;opportunities.&quot;<br />This book is about finding peace of mind, out of healthy choices.<br />One of the most valuable affirmations in this book, simply stated is, &quot;I am worth it!&quot;<br />When one says this, out loud, 10 times in the morning, then 10 times in the evening; and it is said enthusiastically, you experience more breakthroughs in your life than you have even considered making.<br />Read this book to reaffirm your right to honor your potential and celebrate everything that you are.	2003-09-15

And there are some speeches in this story that provide the readers with a great deal to think about, in terms of homeland security.<br />It's a fast read -- not too heavy, yet this book will stretch your mind, as a good book should.	2003-09-10

Then, next to their names, write a list of their negative character traits.<br />Once you have this list, write a personals ad that projects you asking for a man to come into your life who has the negative character traits that those men have.<br />You will laugh, then you will be able to replace those negative character traits with positive ones.<br />The beauty of this book is that you will enhance your self-definition, and automatically detract what you don't want, while you attract what is within your inner being.<br />Reading a book like this one while you are in a relationship is more of a challenge than if you take the time to study the lessons, while you commit to not being in a relationship, until you have cleaned up your unfinished business from your past.	2003-09-03

Each of these men are from very different professions.  And each of these men decided to get together to devise a plan that will get their money back.  They emphasize the exact amount, not a penny more, nor less.<br />For those who don't believe in revenge, deception of the like, I still say that this book is great, because their focus is upon their worthiness, using the crook's, that is Harvey Metcalfe's style and fears against him.<br />As I read this book, I there were so many \\"wow's,\\" \\"Uh oh's,\\" and  \\"go for it's,\\" that I was there, a strong part of the plot.<br />And the phrase that has stuck in my mind the most, from this book, the phrase that the 4 men used to guide them to get what is rightfully there's is, \\"Think Like a Jew.  Act Like a Brit.\\"<br />For me, while I understand that this phrase counts upon stereotypes, this means be analytic, decisive and determined, while you remain charismatic - The results are always pleasant.<br />But, it's a great book, anyway.	2003-09-02

And this book is an excellent source to help you to get there.<br />While I have read the original book, \\"Think and Grow Rich, by Napolean Hill,12 times, I believe that this is an excellent book to read, in addition to the original, for all races, and in particular African-Americans.<br />Writing a book that targets the black audience, as this book does may lead readers to ask, \\"Why 'we' or 'they' need something different, or special?<br />This is analogous to asking, \\"Why do they need a Black networking group?\\"<br />And my answer, as is the essense of Dr. Kimbro's answer, is that someone who is not African-American does not have the same challenges as an African-American has; therefore, identifying the resources, problems and possibilities, via a book, and networking that targets African-American, is an excellent way to answer the questions that Napoleon Hill couldn't answer on a level that Kimbro could answer - combining direct experiences, and research makes for an excellent source to the secrets of success.	2003-09-02

Although the protagonist was born into wealth, and married someone who became a banker, her character was actually frugal.<br />This is one of those books that you can't turn the page fast enough, because even if you read it years ago, you become so caught up in the drama.	2003-08-29

He was stubborn, haughty and all the &quot;attributes&quot; associated with someone who is born with a silver spoon in his mouth.  Baron Able Rosnovski, an immigrant from Poland, was determined, creative and willing to do whatever it takes to never live the impoverished life that he was born into.<br />Both of these men eventually and repeatedly crossed paths, in business.  And they desperately try to outwit one another, at a heavy expense to all around them.<br />As I read this book, I kept wanting to say, &quot;Look in your heart,&quot; because each man was so busy trying to outdo the other that they loss sight of what matters, until the end.<br />Although this book has 477 pages, you will read it faster than a book that is one third its size, because Mr. Archer has developed the characters so well --- you will feel like you are looking at an IMAX movie.	2003-08-19

Although this novel is set in Los Angeles, after the police officers involved in the Rodney King beating were acquitted, this story, and the challenges that the protagonist face in this novel exist in everyday corporate and private settings.<br />As I read this book, I truly felt like I was either a fly on the wall, or I was watching a very good movie.  I laughed on the surprisingly hilarious parts, and said, &quot;Yeah!  Set 'em straight, on the areas that Esther was claiming her voice, during what could be perceived as tricky times.<br />Bebe Moore Campbell captures vividly captures the racial ambivalence, between blacks and whites, as well as between men and women within their own race.<br />I found myself highlighting excellent lines in this book, and thinking about what I would do, if I were Esther.<br />That is the beauty of a novel, and especially one that is written so well --- reading this, you get to live out scenarios, and adapt new ideas for your own life.<br />I truly hope both black and white women read this book, because there are messages for both of us; as there are for men.<br />Bebe Moore Campbell enhances the world through her novels.	2003-08-15

You observe them; you talk with them; you argue with them; and you weep with them.&quot;  - Riki Robbins Jones, Ph.D.<br />This book is where I came up with the lable Autonomous Fem Coach, a lable that I give myself, as a way that says my mission is to guide women and girls to earn trust in themselves.<br />I'm strongly influenced by this book, because it looks at the struggles that many women go through, to be their authentic selves.  It also looks at how to be yourself, yet truly be feminine.  This book is one of those feminist books that I believe even the most traditionally trained male could appreciate reading, because the author includes men in her consideration of empowerment.<br />A sample of the questions that the author asks of readers is:<br />1.  What is most important to you inlife?  Is it achieving?  Making money?  Having a mutually satisfying marriage?  Bearing and raising a child?  Doing something to perserve the  environment?<br />2.  Do you know what will make you happy?  Can you tell your  partner?<br />3.  What kind of difference would you like to make?<br />Excerpt From Her Empowerment Sentence Stem:<br />I have empowered myself in the workplace if ...<br />1.  I have role models within this industry and profession.<br />2.  I have created my own job description.<br />3.  My hours are flexible.<br />4.  I feel free to take time off for necessary personal business.<br />5.  At the end of the week, I usually feel good about what I have  accomplished.<br />Another poignant point that she makes is, &quot;The issue is not whether men are the enemy, but whether women are their own worst enemies.&quot;<br />Riki Robbins Jones, Ph.D. is in the caliber of Nancy Friday, author of &quot;My Mother/Myself,&quot; and Erica Jong, author of &quot;Fear of Flying.&quot;<br />Although this book is billed as &quot;Survival strategies for women of the '90s,&quot; This is a wonderful book to go back to, again and again, because it takes repetition to replace old habits with new, more empowering habits that are passed onto younger girls.go back to, again and again, because it takes repetition to replace old habits with new, more empowering habits that are passed onto younger girls.	2003-08-07

Instead of criticism, compassionately respond to what your interlocutor has experienced.<br />2.  To get someone to do something, give them something that they want; something that is within your principles; something that you do for them, based upon their needs and wants, not yours.<br />3.  Talk about what they want, and encourage them to get it, based upon their own abilities.<br />4.  Before you try to make someone do stomething, ask yourself, &quot;How can I influence him/her, in a way that is mutually respecting, to want to do it?&quot;<br />5.  Show people that you are sincerely interested in their ability to express what they most value?<br />6.  Become a good conversationalist, by listening well, and by responding to the underlying meaning of what your interlocutor is telling you.<br />7.  If you believe that you have something to prove to someone, do so in a subtle, adroit way, without telling anyone that you are doing it - be sure that you are doing it, as part of who you are?<br />8.  When you are wrong, admit, unequivocably, then gracefully change subjects.<br />9.  Begin adverse situations and otherwise, with a friendly demeanor, and focus upon peaceful resolve.<br />10.  During conflicts, let your interlocutor talk more than you.  Recognize that those who talk the most have the most to lose.<br />11.  Show that you consider your interlocutor's ideas and feelings to be just as important as yours are, while you keep counsel with your agreements with yourself.<br />12.  Appeal to nobler motives.<br />13.  When you state a truth, follow this with vivid, interesting, dramatic, yet succinct supportive information.<br />14.  Realize that the majority of people are motivated most by self-expression - challenge them to embrace this.<br />15.  Be sincere, respectful and compassionate<br />16.  When making a request, put it in a form that conveys the idea that your interlocutor will benefit by doing what you are requesting, and that the benefits are ones which you see are ones that s/he appreciates.<br />There's a reason why this book has been around since 1936, and that next to the bible, it is the # 1 book.<br />Read this book to guide yourself to get more out of life, through  taking responsibility for your part in your experiences with each person who you interact with - no matter what the perceived external power.e this.<BR>15.

Adler and Charles Van Doren.<br />To best describe &quot;Notes on How to Live in the World ... and Still Be Happy,&quot; some of the many quotes that I highlighted and will use in my life's work might serve as reasons why you deserve the rewards of reading this book.<br />Quotes:<br />&quot;Happiness is easy.  It is letting go of unhappiness that is hard.&quot;<br />&quot;Happiness is serious.&quot;  This passage leads me to wonder if Denis Prager, author of &quot;Happiness is a Serioius Problem,&quot; borrow ideas from Hugh Prather.<br />&quot;A child can prove that it is possible to be extremely active, and interested in everything, and still be happy, provided that a single goal dominates the mind.&quot;<br />&quot;... the longer you dwell on another's weakness, the more you infect your own mind with unhappiness.&quot;<br />&quot;If you are ever to know a sustained happiness, you must first come to recognize the consequences of the ideas you entertain as welcomed guests.&quot;<br />&quot;Nothing has to go right for me to be happy.

Peer approval (this is usually about image, not reality)<br />2.  Gender-role expectations  (some girls are taught that<br />  having a boyfriend is analogous to being lovable)<br />3.  Lack of experience (as a teen, you are trying to work out a<br />  life that hasn't been lived)<br />4.  Little contact with adult resources (with mother's feeling<br />  threatened by their daughter's youth, many daughters have<br />  difficulty finding role models)<br />5.  Less access to societal resources (most require parental<br />  involvement)<br />6.  Less access to the legal leverage (the laws assume that the<br />  daughter doesn't need this support)<br />7.  She fantasizes about who he could be, with her help<br />  (See, \\"The Princess Who Believes in Fairy Tales\\")<br />8.  Once in the relationship, she decides that she can't get<br />  out of it, even if she wanted to  (See, \\"My Mother/Myself)<br />9.  She doesn't know that both of them are willing participants<br />  in the struggle to be with someone, while avoiding their<br />  fear of recreating their past dramas  (See, \\"Narcissim\\")<br />10. Unspoken social pressure has taught her to avoid herself,<br />  that is avoid being visible to other girls, by going out of<br />  her way to make a guy her project  (See, \\"101 Lies Men Tell<br />  Women: And Why Women Believe Them\\")<br />For the older women, the challenge is:<br />1.

Her decision that her needs are too great<br />5.  Domestic Violence professional's expect her to experience<br />  this again, at least 7 times, before she will be free, or<br />  dead<br />This is a wonder book, written for parents, but certainly good for young girls to also read.<br />What I did not see in this book is something that I have seen again and again from those who are abused is that in the moment that the abuser attacks the girl's worthiness, what she does is choke off her own breathing. This causes her to cut off her thoughts.  This also causes her punish herself for the idea of her being angry at what he is doing to her.<br />For all the teen girls who think that his jealousy, possessiveness, manipulation, or attempts to isolate you from being close to others is cute, or loving you, I invite you to assert these 5 statements, with unwavering conviction,each time you experience his jealousy, possessivesness, manipulation, or attempts to isolate you:<br />1.  I don't like what is happening to me.<br />2.  There is something here that does violence to me.<br />3.  I deserve better than this.<br />4.  I can do something about this.<br />5.  I will do something about this, now.<br />6.  I will not allow this to happen to me, again.<br />Besides these statements, and reading this book, I invite teen girls and women to stop asking yourselves, \\"Why does he act this way?\\"<br />When you spend time asking questions about why he is treating you terribly, you make his problems into being your responsibility.  And this means that you will be trapped into believing that you are inadequate, because you cannot control his self-concept.  You can, however, influence the boy/man's behavior, by reading books like Dr. Murray's book, as you make the commitment to love yourself.<br />By reading a book like this one, and truly making the commitment to master the lessons in this book, you will make sure that less girls and women are abused, because when the lessons of this book become part of your core identity, you will recognize the signs of abuse; you will speak up for yourself, in the present moment; you will congruently tell the guy that his issues are not your issues; and you will show him that not every female is willing to pity his unwillingness to face his fear of his fears - and the world will change.you are inadequate, because you cannot control his self-concept.

Books	5	23	25	N	N	Get Answers to Questions That You Didn't Know You Had	I first read this book, June 1995, while sitting at the beach, far away from a store, and one month before I was to host a family-reunion.<br />My mind was searching for a way to be who I decide I am, while I do my best to respect each of my family members - a tall order, at best.<br />Usually, while I am reading a book, be that fiction or non-fiction, I have paper to write notes into.  But I didn't have them, at this time.<br />One chapter into reading this wonderful book, I had to leave the beach, to buy a notebook, because there are so many powerful tools in this book, ones which I absolutely had to capture in my own written words, as the thoughts and emotions rose up.<br />And once I finished reading this book, and reviewed my notes, I was still amazed at how much more I knew about each of my family members, particularly the one family member who until then I wondered if he even had emotions.<br />You cannot passively read a book like this, and expect to heal what ails you.  You must partner with John Bradshaw, to understand who you are, through who you have and may still be surrounded by.<br />I had one challenge, in reading this book:  John Bradshaw advises readers to ask relatives about facts about other relatives.  In some families, communication is so toxic that no one will tell the truth.<br />And when this is the case, in your family, as you ask yourself the questions, look around you, and expect to find the answer, through holding the question close to your soul.<br />Also, if you haven't read a book like this, and done extensive work, prior, you could look around you, and see who in your life is a mirror of your family members.<br />This will speak volumes to you.<br />Reading this book, prior to hosting my family reunion was so cathartic that my mantra became, &quot;I don't care how many actually show up.  I'll do my part to encourage those who do show up to feel welcome.&quot;<br />What I noticed, and continue to notice, as a result of having read this wonderful book, is that no matter where we come from, we can use that past to claim our voice.  And doing this does require us to admit, over and over again, what was, and what we desire.<br />For those who believe that looking back in the past is blaming those from the past; dangerous; or, is a risk of being trapped by the past, I must say that having studied my past, I am free to look at my notes and see that what I was really doing was accepting who and where I was then.<br />It is in accepting our deepest pains that we automatically enhanced who we are.<br />Read this book to use your past to catapult yourself into your true self.his wonderful book, is that no matter where we come from, we can use that past to claim our voice.

But challenge yourself to say just those three words to that person, while you expect nothing in return.<br />This will teach you self-acceptance, acceptance of others, trust, love and serenity.<br />Also, as part of your &quot;get real challenge,&quot; find 5 people who you tell, what you fear, what you are sad about, and what you are worried about.

They may tell you how it really is for them, in a way that allows them to take responsibility for their own lives.<br />And although they may not tell you how it really is with them, chances are they will tell someone else how it really is with them - which is great, because the idea is that they decide to be authentic.<br />And in giving this gift to these people, you are changing the world, because we all know at least 250 people.

Before reading this book, this weekend, I had listened nearly 10 years ago to the \\"Real Moments\\" tape.  In fact, in 1994, I bought many of Barbara DeAngelis' tape programs.<br />But I had never read her books, until now, because I was and am eternally grateful for what I have learned, and where I have arrived, as a result of Barbara putting herself out there for all of us to grow from.<br />In the book, as in Barbara's tapes, she provides so many life examples that expand upon her messages to her audience.<br />In my notes from nearly 10 years ago, I listed what real moments meant to me, and how I would live real moments - I certainly have grown since then.<br />And now, having written all over my book, as I recognize that I am further along on my journey to make a difference, here is some of what I see as having real moments;<br />Real Moments Are:<br />· Fully being here, now<br />· Realizing what they gift of now is<br />· Finding those parts of ourselves that we lost<br />· Moving deeply into your pain, rather than away from it<br />· Nourishing your hungry spirit<br />· Truly empathizing with your interlocutor<br />· Developing the skill of enjoying where you are now (happiness)<br />· Knowing that your life has meaning<br />· Filling yourself up with love and meaning<br />· Dong something with complete attention, and without any distractions<br />· Remembering what really matters<br />· Fully paying attention to the person you are in conversation with, while you ask yourself, \\"What does he or she need from me, right now?\\"<br />· Learning the power of \\"No,\\" as a complete sentence.<br />· Putting life in perspective<br />· You becoming yourself, not what others expect of you<br />· Just being, without having to perform<br />· Fully breathing your breaths<br />· Conducting your rituals<br />· Expressing your gratitude to yourself, someone else, or to something<br />· Practicing one random act of kindness<br />· Celebrating the birth of the person you have become, as a result of your choices<br />· Silently walking with the person you love<br />· Accepting your aloneness as being with yourself<br />· Encouraging children to keep journals; and writing the journals for the children who haven't learned to write, yet<br />· Seeking out children as your teachers in your life, because they remind you of what you have given away of yourself<br />· Truly surrendering to your emotional and physical wounds<br />· Choosing \\"being\\" over \\"doing\\"<br />· Offer attention, affection and appreciation everywhere you go, everyday<br />· Loving<br />· Sharing your deepest fears and wildest dreams with a compassionate listener<br />· Sharing cherished experiences<br />· Having a belly laugh with someone else<br />· Throwing a party to celebrate someone's life who is still alive, as opposed to after that person is dead<br />· Truly greeting the sun<br />· Breathing more deeply, every moment<br />· Smiling at someone, without wanting anything back<br />· Seeing the soul behind someone else's eyes<br />· Focusing upon the question, \\"Who am I?\\"<br />Thank you Barbara DeAngelis, for teaching me many years ago to write my truths, so that I can more deeply celebrate how I have grown.our choices<BR>· Silently walking with the person you love<BR>· Accepting your aloneness as being with yourself<BR>· Encouraging children to keep journals; and writing the journals for the children who haven't learned to write, yet<BR>· Seeking out children as your teachers in your life, because they remind you of what you have given away of yourself<BR>· Truly surrendering to your emotional and physical wounds<BR>· Choosing \\"being\\" over \\"doing\\"<BR>· Offer attention, affection and appreciation everywhere you go, everyday<BR>· Loving<BR>· Sharing your deepest fears and wildest dreams with a compassionate listener<BR>· Sharing cherished experiences<BR>· Having a belly laugh with someone else<BR>· Throwing a party to celebrate someone's life who is still alive, as opposed to after that person is dead<BR>· Truly greeting the sun<BR>· Breathing more deeply, every moment <BR>· Smiling at someone, without wanting anything back<BR>· Seeing the soul behind someone else's eyes<BR>· Focusing upon the question, \\"Who am I?\\"<br />Thank you Barbara DeAngelis, for teaching me many years ago to write my truths, so that I can more deeply celebrate how I have grown.	2003-02-10

And in this book, Potok tells the story of the struggle between Jewish traditions and finding your own voice.<br />There are 3 main characters:<br />· Reuven, who is raised as an Orthodox Jew, and whose<br />  studies are focused upon his becoming a rabbi.<br />· Danny, who was raised as a Hasidic (the most conforming<br />  of Jewish sects, but becomes a Psychologist, who marries<br />  a woman who is not Hasidic.<br />· Danny, who becomes hospitalized after his enraged<br />  reaction to not having won a prize that he was due to<br />  win.<br />I first read this book in 1998, after reading one Potok book after another.  And back then, I remember telling myself, \\"It would be nice if every man read \\"The Promise,\\" and \\"The Chosen,\\" so that they are able to break the father/son struggle to be human beings, without fear of being feminine.<br />Now, as I review my favorite quote from \\"The Promise,\\"<br />(\\"I know what it's like to be inside a small room, fighting.  I was inside a small room too.  But I talked.  I fought back.  You have to learn to talk and fight back.  You have to learn to do it even if it hurts people you respect and love.  You're not anything unless you can learn to do that ... And sometimes you have to fight even if it means hurting people terribly.  Sometimes you have to hurt a person you love if you want to be yourself.). I see that Potok's demonstration of how conflict between traditional Orthodox Judaism and modern ideas is but a ripple in the pond of every culture, every world struggle, and every relationship.  This is a call for human beings to give others room to be authentic, without revenge.<br />The promise is to be a human being.<br />This is a great read starting at 10 years old.  It will stretch who you are, and give you a voice unmatched by other stories.	2003-02-07

An interesting passage from this book reads, &quot;Some of the most important things I learned came from thinking about my own mistakes and from noticing what I did that lowered or raised my own self-esteem.&quot;<br />This interests me to reread this, because having first read this book in 1994, I wrote so many detailed introspective notes that I too can say, I've learned a lot from thinking and writing about the &quot;learning lessons&quot; of my life.<br />And this is a life-time process.<br />So, what are the 6 Pillars of Self-esteem?<br />First, I'd like to say that a healthy dose of self-esteem is thinking for yourself, no matter what is going on around you; while you maintain the belief that you deserve to be happy.<br />And happiness is when you can say that you have more joy than pain in your life.<br />The 6 pillars are:<br />1.  Live Consciously<br />  This requires us to be fully in the present moment.  And for<br />  most, this takes a bit of practice, because many of us are<br />  conditioned to disown the here and now, to survive what we<br />  have thought that we cannot handle.<br /><br />2.  Accept Yourself<br />  Yes.  You have flaws and attributes.  You also have the<br />  opportunity to enhance who you are, by accepting everything<br />  about yourself.  In fact, the only way to enhance who you<br />  are is to accept yourself.<br />3.  Take Responsibility for Your Experiences<br />  Through my journey, I have learned to be in conversations<br />  where I say to myself, &quot;It comes down to 'this is where you<br />  end, and I begin,'&quot;<br />  Saying such an affirmation has helped me to congruently say<br />  what I will and will not experience.  And this is quite<br />  liberating not only to myself, but also to my interlocutor<br />  (most of the time)<br />4.  Assert Who You Are<br />  Honor what you think, feel, believe, need and want.  Yes,<br />  for many readers this may be a challenge.  But the results<br />  of accepting this challenge are wonderfully fulfilling.<br />5.  Live Purposefully<br />  Make an agreement with yourself to reach your highest<br />  potential, while you maintain balance in your life.<br />6.  Maintain Your Integrity<br />  Know exactly what your principles are.  And stick to them,<br />  no matter what others think or do.<br />This is an easy to follow book that is also between the caliber of a &quot;self-help&quot; book and a &quot;psychology&quot; book.<br />Enjoy!g this challenge are wonderfully fulfilling.<br />5.

It succinctly puts into words ideas that many women continue to struggle with about their identity.  It also points out that many men haven't a clue of the fundamental psyche of women.<br />I believe that in reading this book, many readers will truly realize how powerful women can be, and how much better our relationships with men will be, because this book explodes dependency myths.<br />My favorite passages in this book are:<br />\\"Women help perpetuate the myth of the strong man, for if there is a strong man a woman can imagine that she is safe, that she is being cared for and looked after.\\"<br />\\"Because women unconsciously do not expect satisfactory emotional nurturance and understanding from their partners, men's inadequacy in giving this nurturance is to some extent accepted and even anticipate by women.\\"<br />\\"When women do express their needs, it often comes out as a criticism.  When a woman experiences disappointments as a result of the emotional attention and care she so desperately wants, there is a buildup of emotional upset, because while she may expect that she won't get it, she still feels such great need.  The woman may declare that she doesn't feel happy in the relationship, that he doesn't give enough emotionally, and so on.  He wants her to be more specific, because he doesn't know what she's talking about.  He responds to the criticism with anger, which frightens her.  She finds it hard to be more specific.  She wonders why he doesn't know what she means.\\"<br />\\"The psychological fit is that the woman feels her needs are too great, and so the defenses that the man has constructed against his own feelings of inadequacy in the arena of emotional nurturance, seem necessary because of what appears to be the woman's insatiability.\\"<br />\\"Men look to sex as a way to affirm their identity as well as a means to contact.  Women often trade sex as though it were a commodity in their search for security, warmth, affection, love, and economic protection.\\"<br />\\"She told him he didn't need to have answers or interpretations, but that she would appreciate a hug and some questions.

But who ever you are, and where you are, in terms of following your life's path, you may find other pages that stand out for you.<br />For the first 6 nights, while reading this book, and while writing the answers to the questions that the authors posed, I had very strong dreams that guided me, each morning to more abundance.<br />If I were someone who bought books to give to others, I would buy hundreds of copies of this book, to give to people around the world, rather I know you or not, because there are many lessons for everyone in this book.<br />So, instead, I offer this review as an invitation for you to work with your energy to tap into the unlimited abundance of the universe, through your following the reasons why you are on this earth.	2002-12-13

Norman Schwarzkopf	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Carry On	While it's been many years since I was in the army, reading this book, as I followed the details of both Schwarzkopf's personal and public life, I felt as though I was there with him.  And I was comfortable metaphorically traveling through the life of a born determined soldier.<br />Regardless of what you may think of the Gulf War, or of the military, this is a wonderful story about someone who is determined to live the life that he has been sent here to live.<br />\\"It Doesn't Take a Hero,\\" reflects his message, \\"No matter your history, or the history of the organization in which you most identify with, you can still reach your highest dreams.\\"<br />This book will make you laugh quite a bit, as you follow his determination to avoid politics, and remain true to his basic soldiering identity.  This is not to say that he would be less of a leader, nor less of a person to have aimed for a political position.  He became the soldier that all of his life experiences led him to be.<br />As I read this, I could almost hear his voice, jokes and all.<br />Enjoy!	2002-12-06

And what can be more challenging than to influence entire countries, and even ancient adversaries to take even the most measured risks for peace?<br /><br />In this memoir, Baker shows readers how he uses the three questions below to prepare for his proposed ideas:<br /><br />1. Will we be able to build a domestic consensus in support of<br /><br />  it?<br /><br />2. What kind of political reaction will it create in the<br /><br />  capitals of our adversaries and allies?<br /><br />3. How will it change the nature of our political relations,<br /><br />  internationally?<br /><br />Before communicating his proposal to the country or group that he needs to convince, Baker would \\"leak his ideals to the press\\" and to some other powerful sources, to get public reaction.<br /><br />And, though this book is 672 pages, the factual information is presented in a light way through a great deal of down home humor, such as those in the quotes below:<br /><br />\\"If the horse of the team don't move at the same speed, there'll be an accident,\\"  Francois Mitterand<br /><br />\\"Allowing the two Germanies to work things out on their own in that kind of situation was, in my view, a recipe for a train wreck.\\"  James Baker  (Referring to the unification)<br /><br />\\"There's no end to what a man can accomplish if he doesn't care who gets the credit.\\"  Ronald Reagan<br /><br />\\"What comes through is that the Soviets don't know how to square the circle.

We still practice the denial of beauty's power out of fear of reprisals from other women.  At times it is as if men don't even exist.\\"<br />· \\"Before women can enjoy the rewards that come with the beauty we now work so hard to purchase, we must learn to see our beauty as power.\\"<br />· \\"Young women sacrifice so much at the advent of adolescence and then hate men for not rewarding us adequately for everything we gave up for them.  But boys did not ask it of us.  We did it, drank the KoolAid and then hated boys for not raising us from the dead with a power they never possessed in the first place.<br />To those who gave such strongly \\"negative\\" reviews about this book, could it be that it is not easy for many people to admit how envious most people are, over the beauty that they recognize in others?	2002-11-29

This is a wonderful book for both men and women to read, to get more out of our lives. And read it more than once, because by the time you finish you will want to step back into the world of the scenarios described in this book, to travel further along your ability to appreciate humanity.<br />When we keep in mind the message from William James, \\"Sow a thought; reap an action. Sow an action; reap a habit. Sow a set of habits; reap a character. Sow a character; reap your destiny,\\" as we read a book like \\"The Hazards of Being Male,\\" we will have many \\"Oh yeah's. That explains it.\\"<br />This book also helps men to be men, while they face their authentic selves.<br />Without the right to feel; have a male friend; share financial responsibility with women; participate as involved, playful fathers; no longer be self-destructive; and no longer harbor extreme guilt, traditionally thinking men, that is most men, are not living the life that they deserve to live.<br />\\"The male has paid a heavy price for his masculine, 'privilege' and power. He is out of touch with his emotions and his body.\\" - Herb Goldberg, Ph.D.<br />Their reality is always approached through veils of gender expectations.<br />Men's problems are not changed by legislation, because they have no clearly defined targets against which they can vent their rage. Men will not strongly improve their lives until they experience their underlying rage toward the endless, impossible binds under which they live, which is defined by their role to be all things to all people. This includes guilt and self-denial.<br />So many men are tired, and are forever close to just throwing in the towel, but they haven't thrown in the towel, because they simultaneously harbor guilt, love, and fear of being lonely.<br />Traditionally, men maintain a self-protective stance, to protect themselves from being vulnerable. And despite the appearance of not allowing a woman to control them, men unconsciously see the female in his life as his lifeline.<br />Whether it is amongst friends, their spouse or at the office, men express their trouble to freely express themselves by statements such as \\"I think I'm entitled to get angry,\\" followed by an apology. They don't know how to simply say, \\"When someone does ... I feel angry, because I need ... So, would you mind (action)?\\"  But they can be taught this, when women expect this from them.<br />Another male attitude is, \\"God helps those who help themselves.\\" This is to cover up the chance of appearing to be uncomfortable, anxious, or vulnerable.<br />The highest compliment is to call him \\"fearless.\\" Of course this has held men back from processing their emotions, and taking the stance to live their lives according to what their higher power sent them here to do.<br />When asked why they married and remained married, many say, \\"she has a good effect on me. She stabilizes me.\\" Which means that he counts upon women to regulate his life.<br />The male in our culture finds himself in countless, \\"damned if you do, and damned if you don't no-win binds. He is psychologically fragmented by many contradictory demands. And for his sake of survival he strives to maintain a cool, detached, controlled, guarded and disengaged demeanor.<br />With this understanding of the male psyche, recognition of his guilt, and how he covers it up, your life will be enhanced.lifeline. <br />Whether it is amongst friends, their spouse or at the office, men express their trouble to freely express themselves by statements such as \\"I think I'm entitled to get angry,\\" followed by an apology.

Once I actually master this example, my life will be enhanced beyond my wildest dreams.&quot;<br />The interesting thing that happened, 30 pages into reading this book is that my life has been tremendously enhanced.<br />I was in the process of making several life-changing decisions, which involved a large corporation, and the CEO who seemed to be taking his own time deciding &quot;my fate.&quot;<br />I remember one day getting fed up with the delays, and as I was reading this book, I noted this person's demeanor, my feelings, during those experiences, my needs, and the request that I had to make, with unwavering conviction.<br />I nearly threw out all ideas of applying what I've learned in this book, during my confronting this person.<br />But, as I looked him in his eyes, and as I told myself that fulfilling my needs versus waiting for whatever timetable he was on was not an option, I nearly abandoned the idea of how important it is for me to remember to ask myself what I want this person's reasons to be for doing what I'm requesting of him.<br />And it was in reminding myself of this valuable question; along with my interrupting him with, &quot;I'm confused. I'd like to see the connection between what I said and your response, but I don't. Would you be willing to explain how your words relate to what I said?&quot; that led us to turn things around, in a very big way.<br />I know that I will reread this book many times, because during this first read I kept telling myself to slow down, and really allow what he taught me to permeate my life.<br />While reading the first time has helped me to see what I was telling myself in times that I had not compassionately responded to people who I had judged as petty, I am sure that each time I read this book, I will become better at empathetically responding to people who up to now I had decided were too toxic to deal with.<br />Thank you Marshall Rosenberg.

For example, he suggest that you make a booklet, a newsletter and related literature.<br />I suggest that you replace this with:  write articles that you have published, on topics that you believe you are an expert on.  And do this, even if you are told that you won't be paid.  What you are interested in is establishing your name, and having many people identify you according to your chosen expertise.<br />Also, place all of this information in loose leaf binder, so that you free to make notes, as you ask questions to people in the public speaking industry (meeting planners; publicity agents; journalist; etc.).<br />To be an public speaker you must decide that you are a public speaker, then do what they do, so that you have all that that means.<br />An excellent author, on this topic, which Dr. Anthony also recommends is, Lily Waters and her daughter (both have an excellent standing in teaching public speaking).	2002-11-22

And I'm so happy to have read this a few times more.<br />One of the most valuable questions that Susie Orbach asks is, &quot;How will I be who I wish to be, if I look as I am supposed to look?&quot; I suggest that when you ask this question, do so with the intention of envisioning an answer that works well for you, regardless of what you have seen, &quot;out there.&quot;  This is a question allows women to take ownership of their mind, body and soul.<br />Each year, I interview high school students, regarding their eating and body image beliefs.  And I have seen a growing problem.  By this time in their lives, both women and men now, get so caught up in an imaged protrayed by all forms of the media, that we can lose sight of who we are really meant to be.<br />The reasons for the problem have a long history with women, and a different reason for women than men.  As men are complimented more on how they look, not as a means to flirt with them, but as a measurement of having what it takes, they are being pushed into some of the body image issues that women have a long history with.<br />This is also an excellent question to ask myself, in times when normally I might doubt my eating choices, my beauty, my being enough, or how my ability to be open to others, and still have boundaries in place.<br />I am eternally grateful for this book. Three excellent follow up books to this book, are, &quot;My Mother Myself,&quot; by Nancy Friday,&quot; &quot;Fat and Furious,&quot; by Judi Hollis, then &quot;Overcoming Overeating,&quot; by Carol Munter and Jane Hirschmann.	2002-11-21

Each page is like a short story that defines love, and makes the reader drunk with joy, if you will.<br />One of my favorite messages in this book reads, &quot;Even when no one else seems to recognize how truly remarkable we are, we always have ourselves, the one inexhaustible resource for positive reinforcement, the one person who will always proudly wave our personal flag.&quot;<br />This is a wonderful message to use as an affirmation, because as one says these words, out loud, with closed eyes, 3 times per day, for 21 days (enough time to form new habits), you see, feel and hear more of your connection to the human race.<br />And it is in this new place, one is able to transcend the self and focus upon the needs of others around us, while we fulfill our own needs.<br />It is also the best way to follow the path that you are here to travel.	2002-11-21

And throughout this book she shows that she is anticipating the questions that future authors have both about the business of becoming published and the art of writing that book.<br />I especially like her level of optimism, where although she talks about some challenges of the publishing process, she focuses more on how to turn those challenges into getting what you want.<br />When I first read this book, years ago, I was preparing myself to be published in magazines and newspapers.

People listen to me, and they pay attention when I speak?\\"<br />Your listener is more apt to listen to you, when the strength of your idea is communicated in a way that they feel comfortable with.<br />This book is a tool that teaches readers that instead of trying to get your listener to do what you want, adjust your own communication style in a way that is easy for your listener to hear, understand, appreciate, listen to, and want to act upon.<br />While there are always exceptions, men exchange bottom line information.  And women tend more often to communicate to build relationships.<br />A wonderful example that the author offers to show how to communicate to men is:<br />\\"Your colleague has been unable to attend a meeting. He comes to your office after the meeting and asks, `How did the meeting go?' This is an open-ended question, and as such it implies that he wants a full, general explanation of the meeting.  Do not be misled.  He does not want a full, general explanation; what he wants is:  `It was a successful meeting.  We decided to postpone the sales presentation for a week.  John will get back to us about the details.'\\"<br />This doesn't mean giving up being who you are.  It just means that if you want to experience feeling understood, respected and appreciated you must adjust your communication style in a way for your interlocutor to best receive want you are sharing.<br />This book is fun to read because Marian Woodall considers enough scenarios to support her points, that even if you don't do some of the social taboos that she has identified in this book, you will recognize yourself as having done them several times in the past - and that is certainly life affirming.	2002-11-07

Meditate everyday for the purposes of falling in love with God.<br />2.  Follow the 4 steps to mastery (a. concentrate upon your relationship with God; b. Accept God's power; c. Give without expecting rewards; d. Love God more, each day)<br />3.  Dedicate your existence to knowing the love of God.  Seek to live in this love, and to return this love.<br />4.

Get out of your way and let God move through you!<br />8.  When you seek inward union with God you will reflect that union in every part of your life.<br />9.  Money represents the labor of others.  And when you have money you are the trustee of their energies, time and effort.<br />10.  Once you have mastered the courage to face reality, no matter what the problem is, your courage will never leave you.<br />11.  &quot;To love is to know me; my innermost nature; the truth that I am.

A world where you must forego being human, and become a machine, performing on demand, never feeling, just giving.<br />This is a story, similar to a George Orwell, \\"1984.\\"  But in this story the world has taken away women's right to read, dress however they want, play, and move about, on their own terms.<br />It is a wonderful book to read, to place yourself in this world, and befriend each of the characters, so that you come out appreciating the little things that we have, as a result of the risks that many took before us.<br />And although this book is clearly written for women, I think it's a great read for the man who wants to break out of the traditional-male thinking, and not feel like he is being emasculated.	2002-11-04

What they really want to know, by your entire demeanor, now, is that you are confident.  They want you to be focused upon solution.	2002-11-04

Vernon Baker talks about race, and how being Black during WWII, while in the army also meant having to work harder to prove yourself than his white commanders had to.<br />While these racial problems still exist everywhere, and everyday, on many levels,  the difference is that Baker's behind, and everyone one of his troop's behind was on the line, just because they had to make a difference in times when their white leaders used them to cover up the fact that they were cowards.  To be in, and part of the team, if you will, they had to be braver than their cowardly commanders who really didn't want them there.<br />Another interesting point in this story is, \\"The American Army mostly ignored its black combat troops along the Western Front while the French hailed their valor and awarded the Cross of War, to every member of three all-black regiments.  Most American history books fail to record any of this, and the Army certainly didn't bring it up.\\"<br />\\"Lasting Valor,\\" he gives details that weaving WWII battles, his Wyoming upbringing, and the women who came into his life (his traditionally thinking male identity), into one story that will touch everyone's heart.<br />Also, this book ends in a message similar to Herman Wouk's message, from \\"War and Remembrance,\\" when it states, \\"War, however, is the most regrettable proving ground.  For the sake of my nineteen comrades, I hope no man, black, white, or any color, ever again has the opportunity to earn the Medal of Honor.  War is not honor.  Those who rush to launch conflict, and those who seek to create heroes from it, should remember war's legacy. You have to be there to appreciate its horrors.  And die to forget them.\\"<br />I'd love to see this book become required reading for high school students, throughout America.	2002-11-03

I felt as though I was a valuable part of her life, throughout this book, and in the follow up book, &quot;The Midwife's Advice.&quot; Reading this book provided me with a chance to reaffirm my beliefs, as a woman. The wonderful thing about this story, and in the other books by this author is that you can explore your own life, as the characters unfold. So many things that Hannah and those close to her said, in response to their life's struggles, I have copied into my quotes journal. And now some of their responses are part of my way of being amongst others. You don't have to be a mother, a medical professional, or a woman to get a great deal from this book. It speaks to the human spirit, across the board.	2002-10-27

That is how it really is.&quot;<br />This book, like Lowen's other books, are not light reading, but instead insists that you look deeply into your heart and claim your feelings.<br />This book is also not a trendy &quot;self-help&quot; book, but instead a book replete with clinical and real life examples that you will find yourself growing, as you read this book.<br />This is an author who I would love to meet, and just be fully in the moment with, without much dialogue - just to share a thank you for writing information that helps us all to explore the human condition.	2002-10-27

But soon learns that her self-concept, her causes and her life view conflict with her husband's emotionally shut down attitude.  It also conflicts with the unspoken social rules that her in-laws expect of her.<br />I especially adored some of the wisdom that Ms. Golden shares in this book, when she learned from other women, &quot;Our husbands will forgive infidelty.  But a betrayal of our most importnat duties as wife, that's what they'll never forgive.&quot;<br />She asks what is meant by this, and is told a very true, unspoken message that is part of every culture.  The message is that the duty of all wives, according to traditionally thinking men, is that we are there to set the stage on which their lives will unfold.<br />I had the opportunity, after reading this book to ask many men what they think of this message.  And I asked in different ways, to each men.  The answer was the same - &quot;Yes.  It is true.&quot;<br />And for the women that I discussed this with, they responded with, &quot;Wow.  That is true.&quot;<br />A message like this, one which we women learn, and make part of our lives, can make a huge difference in our relationship, because then we are more able to accept that if we are to set the rules, from the very beginning, and be consistent with those rules, we are more apt to get what we want.<br />Read this little book to explore a woman's journey to finding her place in life.	2002-10-27

So, do your homework.<br />My favorite message, from this book, which I have used as a quote in published articles is, &quot;If you alienate your peeers, you won't have to worry about corporate enemies.&quot;<br />Read this book to balance being yourself, and being a person amongst business people.	2002-10-27

Often there is just an image to uphold, to keep everyone distant, while each does what they damn well want to do.<br />Despite the violence, as I read this book, there was so much character development, and so much humor that I enjoyed reading this book.<br />And I hope that you too will enjoy it.	2002-10-27

I am so very happy to have read his books.<br />Looking back, the most important thing that I believe that I learned, in reading this book, my favorite amongst those that I have read by Branden, requires me to preface this by saying that I grew up in an environment where thinking for yourself was punishable in the worst of ways.<br />The point in which I picked up Branden's books, and this one in particular was when I told myself that those childhood messages were &quot;junk.&quot;<br />I knew that through reading books there were some answers that I had decided that I couldn't find any other place.<br />I gained from reading this book, to recognize the difference between what I want and what I need.<br />That marked a huge step in my life's journey.  Because then I had to study what kept me from owning those 2 basic parts of being human.<br />I learned through reading this book to not only look at my history, but to also explore who everyone in my life was, and who they are now - I became a scientist in a human lab, prepared to own, admit, experience and express my feelings, in the present moment.<br />And oh did this become comfortable.<br />Read this book to speak through your authentic voice.<br />It will require you to be patient with yourself, and to parent yourself in a way that you have never been parented before.<br />Honor everything about who you are, the &quot;good,&quot; &quot;bad,&quot; and in between.<br />Ask youself who gave those labels to you.

And it probably contributed well to his political career.<br />But as an army veteran, I was more drawn to the many challenges that Colin Powell had in Vietnam, and with conflict amongst the ranks.<br />I was also compelled to ask myself about the challenges that his wife must have had, and probably still has in being his better half.<br />There is such a role to play out, to be part of this journey.<br />And while Powell doesn't go into depth about this, he does address the commitment that he made to his wife, regarding a stable home life.<br />I also noticed, in between the lines, so to speak, that, like Norman Schwartkoff, Colin Powell grew up with some pretty \\"strict\\" parents.<br />And it was not what he experienced, but what he did with what he experienced that has made Colin Powell one of the most loved leaders of this world.<br />Read this biography to be part of his journey, and in turn to add value to your own dreams.	2002-10-27

Which of course led me to focus upon examples of myself having and expressing all of these.<br />One thing that I didn't care for, in this book, is that many of the examples are dated.<br />I had to tell myself to get pass this, so that I could really benefit from reading this wonderful book.<br />And in my growth, I realized that \\"Grow Rich While You Sleep,\\" is about creating mental pictures of yourself in the act of solving your problems -- not having your problems solved, but in the act of solving those problems.<br />When I listed problems that I was facing it turned out that even though before buying this book I felt worried, I saw that I only had 3 problems.<br />With the affirmations that are in this book, as well as those that I created, which I use just before going to sleep, have guided me to wake up with solutions, that have netted me more than I expected.<br />Remember, \\"a problem wouldn't be a problem, if there wasn't a solution.\\"<br />When you are about to fall asleep, if you will allow the room to be totally dark, with no sounds in the room, close your eyes.

And I have since read this book many times.<br /><br />Just saying verbal judo to others gets a laugh.  However, this is a very serious and valuable book.<br /><br />Have you ever walked away from someone, telling yourself, \\"Next time ... I am going to be prepared.  Next time, he or she will not get me.  I will be ready?\\"<br /><br />What mastering verbal judo takes is for you to be fully in the moment, conscious of who you are, and not only conscious of what you are experiencing, in the presence of your interlocutor, but also willing to to use your interlocutor's energy to redirect what they expressed to you from something destructive to something mutually empowering.<br /><br />I have taught myself to smile, on the inside, and to even, ever so slightly nod, when someone has insulted me.  This is my anchor, if you will, to breath my way to using their insult to defuse what just happened.<br /><br />Here's an example, \\"Calm Down!\\"<br /><br />My Verbal Judo response: (said in a calm, relaxed demeanor) \\"I am as calm as I know how to be, right now. And with your help, I can be more calm.  Are you ready?\\"<br /><br />This response is an acknowledgement of your interlocutor, and it is a declaration of your self-respect.  This is teaching your interlocutor how to treat you well.<br /><br />Another example is, \\"You think too much!\\"<br /><br />My Verbal Judo Response is, \\"Yes.  I do think a great deal.  And I thank you for your disguise compliment, because thinking for myself is so important to me.\\"<br /><br />My response told this person that I value who I am, and that I appreciate his or her awareness of what matters to me.<br /><br />Over the years, because I use life as a human lab, I have created several real life examples of how to respond, instead of reacting to manipulative people, or as Scott Peck would call, \\"evil people.\\"<br /><br />An additional tool in my being able to do this was when I read John Bradshaw's, \\"Healing the Shame That Binds You.\\"<br /><br />I learned what stops a person from being able to master verbal judo, in the present moment, really is fear (false, education, appearing real).  And when you realize that your conscious mind is telling your subconscious mind what to do, you are free to tell your conscious mind that although you have just been attacked, this is your opportunity to teach this person to take their self-hate somewhere else.<br /><br />Read this book as a tool to get more out of your life.

I captured, in detail, what my eye contact is like, and why, I also captured my breathing, throughout my public speaking.<br />Without going through more details than there is room on this review, when you read this book, and truly walk through the process, including the expert testimonials, as you open your mind to the possibilities for yourself, you will give such wonderful presentations that you will look forward to your next chance to present to an audience.<br />I especially appreciate the visual tool that Ms. Waters gives, to help all public speakers to be organized and thorough.  She uses the idea of a tree - the trunk, the branches, and the leaves.<br />When you picture that tree, you see in your mind's eye, your theme, your main points, and the subpoints from those points.  This helps you to focus upon delivering your message in a way that captivates your audience to be motivated to buy into your message.	2002-09-25

Forever fleeing the light of self-exposure and the voice of their own conscience, they are the most frightened of human beings.\\"  Which I believe is an excellent point for people to be aware of, so that they choose to be empowered, from within their soul.<br />[The author also writes]\\"It is a thesis of this book that evil can be defined as a specific form of mental illness and should be subject to at least the same intensity of scientific investigation that we would devote to some other major psychiatric disease.\\"<br />For me, this book was very helpful in strengthening my ability o maintain my boundaries, in the face of situations that as a child I would have given into...<br />The only point in which I disagree with Scott Peck in this book is when he says that he has seen cases where pepole have made evil choices for no apparent reason, other than the desire to exercise the freedom of his or her will. (That is a reason).	2002-09-18

One of the greatest things about reading a book is that you can ask yourself for answers to questions that when you find the answers, your life will be better.<br />This is one of those books.  I remember years ago, before the first time that I read this book, I wondered about charismatic people, and how they really do it.<br />This book is the answer.  \\"How to Work the Room,\\" is not just a great title for a book, it is also a great anchor, to guide you to focus upon all the social opportunities in one room, for the entire time that you are there.<br />We all must network, to have others open doors for us, because this goes much further than our trying to condense an entire career into 5 seconds of introduction - it won't work.<br />Here are some wonderful things you might learn:<br />1. You have just been introduced to someone at an event.  And the introducer has left you with this person<br />For some, this can be awkward.  But for those who read this book, you might begin by deciding that at the very least, you have in common the person who introduced the 2 of you.  So you could say, \\"How do you know Sally?\\"  This will get a conversation started.<br />2. You are going to a networking function, based upon the recommendation of someone who attends the same type of group, but in another city.  And you have some hesitations<br />A great way to be prepared is to spend a half hour the day before, writing down what you are going to, the purpose of the meeting, the time to be there, how long, and a few other notes.  This will put you in a great frame of mind to connect with others there.<br />3. You think that small talk is phony, and you hope nobody will try it on you<br />Small talk is appropriate for networking meetings.  It also prevents you from having to come up with a lot to say.  With small talk, you are actually opening the door to find out what others are interested in.  Which will help you to keep the topic on them, and away from you.  And this will keep you relaxed, not to mention welcomed in their eyes.<br />This book has many hilarious examples that everyone can relate to, and use to practice owning that room., not to mention welcomed in their eyes.<br />This book has many hilarious examples that everyone can relate to, and use to practice owning that room.	2002-09-18

Yet, I had this book for some time before I chose to read it, because I only read a book when I preceive that there is something in the book that fits into what I want to enhance in my life, right now.<br />This week, I found myself asking for a book comparable to &quot;The Power of the Subconscious Mind,&quot; and &quot;Open Your Mind to Prosperity.&quot;<br />Reading books that teach lessons about the Universal Subconscious Mind, which is what &quot;Three Magic Words&quot; is also about, touch my life so deeply.  By the time I have finished reading the book, despite my notes in the margins, I am challenged to describe what I've gotten out of the book.<br />Through reading this book, I have enhanced myself a billion times over, in every page.  That I know.  B<br />The power of U.S. Andersen's book, has led me to grow beyond my wildest dreams.  And I know that I will reread this book, along with the books, referenced in the back of this book.<br />So what are the 3 magic words?<br />Well, that question was always on my mind. And to tell anyone what this author believes are the 3 magic words would not help you - they may even turn you away from reading this book. Because to know those 3 words is to read this book with an open heart, willing to be taught, and knowing that you are safe to explore your mind.<br />As I read this book, I wrote what I thought might be the 3 magic words.<br />My guesses were:<br />1. Faith+hope+love<br />2. Big+humble+visionary<br />3. Memory+reason+imagination<br />4. Thought+conviction = manifestation<br />5. Know, learn and build<br />6. Thought+faith+creator<br />7.

Amy Tan put into several short stories, what Nancy Friday put into a pyschological guide.<br />Before any woman can be free to live her own life, she must understand, accept and appreciate where she begins and her mother ends, in each of their interactions.<br />And societal expectations can play a big impact on this challenge for all of us.<br />In this novel, 4 Chinese mothers, who grew up during China's war with Japan pass on that universal and unspoken rule that says that to be female is to not process your thoughts, and speak through your own voice.<br />I recommend everyone read this book, while you think about your own experiences, and how they compare.  You will be amazed at how Ms. Tan has told your childhood story, no matter what your race or socioeconomics are.<br />And as you note your story, through this story, share your stories with other women and girls, so that we all benefit from knowing that we can love our mothers, while we break free of the symbiotic bond that has for too long held us back.	2002-09-11

This book captures the mindset of how many enlisted military men think.  Whether a war is about to happen, or we are at peace time, enlisted men enter the military, based upon the wonderful promises of adventure, heroism, and \\"be all you can be.\\"<br />In the military social conditioning, those who enlist are taught to live for the military.  They are taught to disown their limitations, feelings, needs and wants, for the good of military missions.  This includes taking what comes your way, as being part of developing your right of passage.<br />The main protagonist in this story, Private Robert E. Lee, \\"Prew\\" Prewitt, finds himself constantly in trouble, amongst his peers, and with the girls that he chooses.  But he won't allow the reality to be something to drive him to think of the here and now.<br />He is so removed from the here and now that he is willing to put up with anything, this includes being brutally beaten up, and being in the stockade.  He has that conditioned military mind set of, \\"Oh.  I can handle it.  Bring it on.\\"<br />What impresses me most about this novel is from page one, through the last page, there is so much to absorb, think about, process, and consider from so many angles.<br />Reading this novel offers readers a glimpse into the human condition, and a chance at making some pretty powerful decisions about living in the here and now.<br />When he witnesses another person being beaten to death, Prew becomes consumed with revenge.  His commitment of revenge becomes self-fulfilling.  Which leads him further down the path of destruction.<br />And what I most admired about this novel is	2002-09-10

It will not be the abstaining from an act, but the coming of a state of mind.  In this sense the most insignificant writer can serve peace, where the most powerful tribunals can do nothing.&quot;<br />All family members, and military figures in this great novel had to find their own form of peace.  Their faith was challenged.  As was their fundamental ways of life.<br />I especially enjoy how the arthor combined true history with the fictional family.  It was easy to relate to each family member, and to root for their desire for peace.<br />The message that the quote above carries in my heart is also something that I believe we must apply in our daily lives.  It's extremely valuable to face problems from a desire for peace, knowing that looking directly at the problems, and what role we play creates love that is passed onto others, naturally.	2002-09-07

Yet, I hesitated to read this, because I had not voiced what I felt about those hearings.<br />I actually looked over my shoulders, when I glanced through this book, before buying it, because I had decided that so many people around me demanded my opinion of this tragedy.<br />When I watched the hearing, while I sat next to others, for whatever reason I waited to say whether or not I believed Dr. Hill.  I wanted to process it all, in the privacy of my own space.<br />Watching her, on many levels I related to her.  Yet, I had some unanswered questions that reading this book, along with other books that reference this tragedy helped me to make my own decisions about what happened.<br />Dr. Hill put a voice to many of the challenges that I had, as professional African-American woman, who wanted to speak about many issues that too high a number of African-Americans refused to communicate.  Before reading this book, I wanted to be free to speak against some socialized rules that I grew up with, that are common in African-American families.  But, I wanted to communicate that I am proud of being African-American.<br />And as a result of reading this book, I gained tremendous courage to fully live my life's mission, which is to guide women and girls to earn trust in themselves.<br />To this day, as a journalist, if an editor argues against Anita Hill, I refuse to write for that paper.<br />Thank you, Dr. Hill.	2002-09-03

Haven't you said something before that you wish you could take back?  And hasn't someone said something to you, in words that contradicted their actions?  And I'll bet that their actions mean more to you, than their words.<br /><br />We all throw out symbols of communication, every minute that we are interacting with another person.<br /><br />And the meaning of that communication really comes down to the response or reaction that we get from those we are talking to.<br /><br />Read this book to enhance the quality of your life.<br /><br />This book enhanced how I read people, because it also taught be to be more free to communicate with my subconscious mind.<br /><br />And the more my self-talk enhanced, the more my social interactions with others became better.<br /><br />Read this book because you deserve more out of your life.	2002-09-03

Being a fairly new business, I had to overcome the idea that my business name really does not say what prospects will recognize as what I'm doing --- it was hard to see that the name, which I had chosen represented more about where I have evolved, and less about what I was in business to serve.<br />And once I accepted this, I was free to start asking people what they think of the new name that I have come up with.  I also objectively listened, while I allowed myself time to come up with what really is 5 syllables or less; something that communicates to my prospects the benefits that I provide.<br />I kept asking myself what is in the minds of my prospects.  And I saw more than I saw before.  Which has netted me, a profit in my business bottom line, today.<br />Another point that surprised me was that Ford is not doing as well as I assumed it is doing.  And my assumption was based upon the fact that of all automotive makers that exist, I have only read about the history of Ford.  I haven't read about General Motors.  Which I am sure that once I do read about GM, I will say, \\"Wow!\\"<br />A downside that this book has, as in many that I have read is that when it speaks of service, it's not talking about selling writing, speeches or consulting.  So the reader must ask herself how the wonderful lessons could apply.<br />Yet, I truly recommend that everyone, 18 and over buy this book, because this book provides tools in convincing the right people to choose what you are offering, on terms that are mutually beneficial.ng, on terms that are mutually beneficial.	2002-08-28

You can't go now!  You have work to finish!&quot;<br />Like some other reviewers, I also read this beautiful biography many years after having lived in Italy for 3 years, while in the army.  But luckily, while there, I did appreciate the art and I became fluent in Italian.<br />Read this book to appreciate someone's commitment to do what he was meant to do, regardless of the world events, politics, competition, or community excitement.<br />Michelangelo died leaving the dome and other great works of art unfinished, that were completed by others, later, all of which still stand several hundred years later.	2002-08-27

And I cried for each character, because they are suffered tremendously.<br />And in the end, I claimed my higher self, in a calm, mater-of-fact way, along with Janie.  It was as though we were taking on the world.<br />This book gave me a look into the human condition -- the choices the challenges, and the ways to rise like the phoenix.<br />I'd also like to say that this book is not just about African-American, or southern lifestyle.  It's great for relationships and friendships.  This book is also a great reference for your commitment to bring out the best in who you are meant to be.<br />And if you think the dialect in this book is challenging, you might also consider this challenge to be like any other good book, which is always a challenge for you to add more to your identity.	2002-08-27

And I felt as though I was not growing as much as I had grown, in previous years, after college, when I discovered how wonderful it is to read books, for growth.<br />Throughout this book, as the author presents concrete examples of how to solve problems that others present to him, he guides  readers to affirm slowly, quietly and feelingly, as you visualize the end result, and the state of freedom that you will have, because you have faith in your mind.<br />He also advises you to create these affirmations, which you will verbalize at least 3 times a day.<br />Well, for me, I had to say, &quot;But wait a minute!  How can I affirm all of these, 3 times a day?  I have so many things that I want to solve, so many goals that I want to surpass, and some defeating statements to replace with empowering statements.&quot;<br />The answer came to me in less than 2 days, as I chose to type my affirmations.  Initially, my plan was to retype them everyday.  But, through the power of what I have learned from this book, the 7 pages of typed affirmations all led me within one week to relax and realize my dreams.<br />Things happened before I realized that they really did happen.<br />My affirmations were so strong, so much a part of myself, that consciously, I instructed my subconscious mind to take care of things, just as a leader delegates - and things certainly happened.<br />Read this book, because you deserve to master the laws of your mind.	2002-08-08

He learned that he had lived his entire life trying to make everyone like him, at the price of not knowing who he himself was, in his heart.<br />And it was not until he was able to cry tears from his heart, that his armor disappeared, and he was able to go home, and truly love his wife and child.	2002-07-19

There was just an air about &quot;women's lot.&quot;<br />I had to remind myself that in this experience, just as in reading &quot;Women's Room,&quot; there are many spiritual lessons to learn.<br />First, it is due to the courage that having written this book took that women are thinking better of themselves.<br />And, we have a long way to go.<br />Yes, there was some men bashing, and some bashing against African-Americans.  And more importantly we must look inside ourselves, and amongst ourselves, as women, to own, admit, experience and fully express what we feel, think, want and need.<br />Another lesson to be learned from this book is that with one voice, others will be heard.<br />And you might start out mouthy, or obsessed, but you will ultimately calm the storms in your soul, by giving voice to who you really are.<br />Every women who is 18 years and older could benefit from reading this book.<br />It's time that we make yet another difference in our lives.	2002-07-16

Reading this book, I have gained knowledge in how to connect with people. I have also learned how to read them, even if they don't know what I am doing.  And it is one of my most favorite hobbies.<br />As human beings, we are constantly interacting with others.

In the very public work that I do, I too often hear, as I just heard yesterday, well-meaning white people say, &quot;The way to take care of diversity is to never mention it again.&quot;<br />And it is this kind of message that reminds me that we have a ways to go in race relations.<br />This book is a collection of stories from famous women, both white and black, about their experiences with race.<br />While every chapter had me deeply moved, I must say that the chapter titled, &quot;Contents Under Pressure:  White Woman/Black History,&quot; by Catherine Clinton, was the most moving.<br />This is a story about a white woman who teaches African-American History.<br />This is, a reverse discrimination story that has value for everyone to read.  By her name, and her profession, she is assumed to be African-American.  But she is Caucasian.<br />Her published work has led to many invitations to speak on race relations.<br />But, when they meet her, in person, and see that she is not African-American, things change.<br />And she had to put in a tremendous amount of time, to show that she is here to stay, despite the resistence of others.<br />In the end, this professor taught her students that the thickness of your skin, and not its color is a useful measure for success.<br />This is a professor whose mission lives on through her students.<br />I invite everyone male or female, of all races to read this book, as you think of yourself as a fly on the wall.<br />You will grow, beyond your wildest dreams.	2002-06-26

Expect more from the authur.

This has given me a level of power that before reading this book was not even imaginable.<br />Thanks to reading this book, I have learned to be fully in the present moment, in 99% of my interactions with others.<br />And while fully in this moment, during excitement, I can seem to be too calm, but I am really mastering listening to the point that I am absorbing details, while I separate who my interlocutor is, from who I am, so that I make decisions, during our interactions that represent my highest self.  I savor each moment, as I listen to my subconscious voice.<br />Dr. David Schwartz, advises the readers to be a scientist in the lab of human behavior.  I am definitely that.<br />From this latest reread, I have created a new habit that has made me feel really great - and my customers feel really great.  That habit is to answer the phone with, \\"Good morning.  It's a awesome day.  May I sell you some publicity/coaching lessons/seminars (whichever is appropriate)?\\"<br />Another habit which I acquired during the first read of this book is to write a commercial, to sell myself to myself.<br />My commercial is a one-page sales pitch, that repeats the product/service, which is \\"Carmen.\\"  It describes many things about me.  And it reminds me to focus upon being big enough for what I want.<br />This book contains, literally hundreds of suggestions for  readers to improve their ability to get the best out of life.<br />Read this book, because you deserve the best of yourself.

We want to be nice, and that's good.<br />But it isn't good if we are nice to someone else, at the expense of our own worthiness.<br />Men are socialized to lie to avoid their fear of women's anger, because it brings up insecurities in many men, who have spent their lives running away from their emotions.<br />Because I read this book several times, and because I have written notes in the margins, I am empowered to choose what I want.<br />For example, if a man say's, &quot;Oh, it wasn't that,&quot; he is evading your subject, and his feelings.<br />And here are 4 reasons why:<br />1.  He wants his thoughts, feelings, and actions to be  inaccessible to you.<br />2.  He wants to build upon your good faith and acquiescence.<br />3.  He intends to do what he wants to do, without your knowledge.<br />4.  He has no desire to be accountable to you.<br />Now, if you turn these reasons around, asking yourself what the long-term affect this would be upon your life, you will notice that you will question your sanity, if you don't confront his dishonesty, and appreciate the persistent rumbling in your gut.<br />You would also leave it up to him to give you permission to be who you are.<br />Many women look the other way, because to directly look at these lies, would also lead to confronting some mis-truths that women are socialized and bound by.<br />But, again, the long term affect is terrible.<br />So, any woman reading this review, please read this book, and choose to do as I do, let go of any man who desperately needs to run away from himself.  Your life is too precious to be his dumping ground.	2002-06-04

This is a powerful question to ask youself, and those around you, in the face of self-defeating thoughts and comments.<br />I thought I had converted every shame-wound from my childhood into empowering habits, ones that guide me to solve my biggest problems ---until I reread this book.<br />The first time that I read this book, 7 years ago, I was so glad to have a name for the shame-wounds that I kept recreating in every aspect of my life.<br />And once I had a great definition, and many examples of how I not only experienced shame, but also recreated it, I taught myself to respond to my experiences, instead of reacting to them.<br />But what was missing, in all of these years was someone to mirror my evolved self.<br />John Bradshaw points out that we who have come from a shame-based childhood need a circle of people who mirror are needs, wants and beliefs, because it was people, our primary caretakers, who passed on to us their disowned shame.<br />Even though I have read so many books, and have evolved so much, I have had the opportunity to recognize in rereading this book that I need to be witnessed by a circle of people, which I will call my adult family -- without that recognition we all stagnate.<br />Years ago, I couldn't phathom joining such a group, for 3 reasons:<br />1. I have no chemical dependencies;<br />2. I feared that baring my soul to a body of strangers would<br /> mean that I would be permanently humiliated and ashamed;<br /> and,<br />3.

I've also healed so well that even if I bare my soul to someone who is toxic, someone who won't be able to compassionately respond to my authenticity, reading this book has helped me to see that I am more than my dark sides.<br />I advise anyone reading this book to do so, with pen in hand.

Books	5	0	1	N	N	Anger Led Me to Buy This Book	And I am glad that I have read this wonderful book.<br />Every where I went, I heard about this book.  And for whatever reason, I kept saying, &quot;Yeah, okay, I'll get to it.&quot;  I do this because when I find a book, I must find it as part of my life's journey.  It must call me as part of my solving some fundamental problems, in my life.  And that definitely was the case with this book.<br />Because I didn't have enough money to do something that I had my heart set on doing, I had lowered my standards to collaborate with someone who, as it turned out judged me, not by character but by color.  And when I walked away from her, as I drove across town, I just had to find the answer.  So, I bought this book.  And in one day, I read my way to some of life's most fundamental answers.<br />I received more than I expected.  For example, as a freelance journalist, I often wonder about some books, and how they become best-sellers.  Kiyosaki answers that.  I also wondered what the rich tell their children that seems so much a part of the fiber of their being.  Kiyosaki also answered that.<br />This book, while philosophical and not a how to, is definitely an inspiration.<br />Another point that inspired me, while reading this book is that Ray Kroc, of McDonald's became wealthy not because he has the best hamburgers, but instead because he believed that he is in real estate - and here in San Diego, with his widow making so many generous donations, involving land, we see the results of that focus.<br />Read this book to become financially intelligent, and to leave a legacy.	2002-03-19

I read this book June 1998, after having read 5 others of Chaim Potok's wonderful novels.  And this time I was drawn to this book after reading \\"The Jewish Phenomenon\\" followed by, \\"When All You've Ever Wanted Isn't Enough.\\"<br />While \\"My Name is Asher Lev,\\" is a story of an artist, who is an Observant Jew, more importantly, I saw this book to reflect the challenges that many of us have in living our life's purpose, especially those who discover their life's purpose long after everyone around them has a different view of their role in life.<br />It's a threat to those who love you to watch you live within your life's mission, when they have spent their lives living according to blind loyalty, traditions, and unquestioned habits.<br />And it takes courage to redefine who you are, while you ride out the anger, fear, envy and hate that family members can have, as Asher Lev's father, Aryeh, seemed to have of his gifted son.<br />Here was a boy whose father's father, and all those before him followed what the Rebbe and his ancestors dictated is right for them.  But Asher Lev found a way to combine both worlds, the Christian and the Jewish, through his art forms.<br />This is a wonderful book for anyone to read, slowly, as you reflect upon your own challenges, and your desire to live a balanced life.<br />Another message within this beautiful story is that when you believe that you should be doing what you believe God sent you to do, you must find mentors who will not allow you to run away from your life's purpose.<br />Thank you Chaim Potok.	2002-01-27

But a little voice inside of me, from as young as 5 years old said that I will not limit my true self.<br />I had decided that I could be Black, proud, and an expert on speaking through my own voice.  And this certainly has paid off for me.<br />Having just read, &quot;The Jewish Phenomenon,&quot; I am further along on my path. As a business owner who dares to be unique, I must push the envelop for the power that Jews see in being money conscious.<br />I am impressed with this book on many levels:<br />1.  Steve Silbiger uses humor and concrete ideas to reinforce<br />  his ideas<br />2.  He points out the down side, as well, about the Jewish self-<br />  esteem<br />3.  He opened my eyes to the fact that Jews are labeled as being<br />  of an ethnic group - I truly hadn't thought of them as such<br />4.

Adler and Charles Van Doren's book, &quot;How to Read a Book&quot; -- &quot;Good books are over your head; they would not be good for you if they were not.&quot;<br />Then, I noticed, as I really pondered the messages of this book on frugality, that I had been writing 101 goals, in a notebook, while reading this book.  This book has been and is good for me.<br />Also, because I was raised with status symbols, with no education on how to be wealthy, I learned, while reading this book, that when I slow down, and really do what I love to do, when I really focus upon thinking like someone whose net worth is at least $1 million, I am free to appreciate all that I have, and all that will come to me, in due time.<br />I am grateful to these authors, because I no longer look at other people's status symbols, and decide to feel pain --- I have created a vision for myself, based upon what is right for me, as opposed to external measurements of what I should have to prove who I am.<br />Reading this book has definitely lifted a burden from my shoulders.<br />Thank you.<br />I will definitely read other books written by these authors, because I want a net worth that comfortably places me in the millionaire club, while I make a difference.	2001-12-02

It was a time of profound family betrayal, or acceptance of what I didn't want to believe about who my family really is, what they had expected of me for my 43 years of life, and the role that I blindly held.  This book was a painfully compelling book for me to read, yet one that had supported me through my crisis, and led me to convert my family history into becoming a public speaker, a gender-based self-esteem coach, and a journalist.  Last week, I decided to read this again, as I noticed that I am being invited to events that signal to me that I have made giant steps since reading this book in 1999.  I am so excited about writing and presenting tailored training to make a difference in each of my client's lives.  I had written so many introspective documents, for so long, that now, even though I continue to introspectively write, I am consciously and unconsciously talking as someone who is here to make a difference in everyone whose life I do touch in some way.  I have found a level of peace through reading Richard J. Leider's book that required me to look deeply in my soul and befriend everything about myself.  I actually giggle when I reread my journals from 1999, where I had written profound painful feelings that I experienced.  I giggle because I see how I weathered my way through living the life I am meant to live.

I keep telling myself, at this point to not make another sales call, until I have read this book 4 times, but because I am learning so much, it is natural for me to make some sort of sales call, everywhere I go.  And in most cases, I am gathering information on the person, more information than they probably realize that I am gathering.  But it helps me to be in rapport, as I show them that they need my services.<br />There are some parts in this book where I have read the objections, and examples of how to respond, not react to the objections, and I had said to myself, \\"I could never do that.  It seems somehow wrong.\\"  Then, as I read this book for the second time, I am not only adopting what seemed uncomfortable, but I am definitely putting my charming spin on the dialogues.<br />Long before reading this book, I had read, \\"Think and Grow Rich,\\" 13 times.

In both of these books, I was able to vicariously be there, and emotionally travel with each person in these stories.<br /><br />And it gave me a sense of peace that I had not had before about being African-American.  It helped me to come up with the most empowering responses to not only suttle racism from Euro-Americans, but also suttle responses to African-Americans who seem to be bound by expecting to just get by (who also believe that empowered African-Americans somehow owe them endless worthiness).<br /><br />To me, even though this book is titled \\"Queen,\\" it has many stories:  politics; narcissism; racism; boys growing into manhood; belonging; the price of not having someone to verbalize your pains to; and, how whites turned their outrage over their motherland into what drove them to do the same to blacks, in this country.<br /><br />During the entire time that I was reading these 2 books, as I conducted my day to day responsibilities, I felt like I had a secret weapon against being held back.

I now advise women, everywhere that I go, to read this book, then  follow up with 2 other books (&quot;Overcoming Overeating,&quot; and  &quot;Fat is a Feminist Issue&quot;).

Some of my favorite  phrases from this book are, &quot;First time a victim, second time a  volunteer&quot;; &quot;Sweep your own side of the street&quot;; &quot;How  did I teach this person to push just the right button?&quot;; and,  &quot;Crotch watch.&quot;  If you think that this is just about eating or  issues with your mother, it's not.  I learned a lot, about corporate  politics, and about how I had, up to reading this book, expected women to  be who I thought they should be.  I also learned how I used to ask myself,  &quot;maybe I should do this differently, then this woman and I might get  along.&quot;  This book can help women to see one another as separate,  autonomous people who deserve to be visible, authentic and nurtured.  When  created a list that I call my Invisible Counselors, I listed Judi Hollis,  who I have never met, because she taught me to accept both my reality and  other people's reality, in a way that frees me to find people who encourage  me to be in my mission.	2000-02-29

I wrote so much in the margins, and on any piece of paper that I could get my hands on.  I felt as though I was a kindred spirit with the author.  And, I especially  enjoyed his anticipation of religious people's argument against personal  growth.  I know that I will read this book again, between other books,  especially after I read novels that contain emotional pain.  Reading this  book, has guided me to heal many old wounds, and to demand of myself to let  go of past unmet expectations. It also has me more open to study religion,  from an historial and social side.	2000-02-03
