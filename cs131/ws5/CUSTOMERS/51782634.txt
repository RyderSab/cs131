A copy of this book might be a life saver for them.   <br />It's a good one for even high-energy people to have on hand.  Every now and then things get you down, but dipping into this book gives ideas to jump start your enthusiasm again.  <br />When you read a section, you say \\"of course,\\" but it is good to be reminded of these.  Some concepts may be new to you. <br />Examples of these \\"secrets\\" are: <br />*negative people bring you down <br />*unfinished business is an energy drain <br />*embrace the present <br />*never envy anyone <br />Mostly the book benefits you by giving you perspective.  We all have a lot going on in our lives, but keeping it in perspective makes it much easier to deal with.  Attitude is everything!	2005-02-16

I do recommend getting a basic Fodor's or Frommer's for your trip and supplement it with Top 10 Orlando.  This book catagorizes the sights and gives the top 10 for each.  Categories include: golf courses, places to cool off, festivals, high end restaurants, dinner shows, hip clubs, ways to have fun on the cheap, family restaurants, etc.   <br />Each listing has a short description plus the address, phone and sometimes the hours.   <br />Within the theme parks, it lists the top ten attractions so you can make the most of your time.

There is soooo much to see at Disney and around the area that you will miss a lot if you don't have a good guidebook like this.  I like the \\"Strategies\\" highlights that give the best times to visit certain attractions and the \\"Need a Break\\" inserts that clue you into quick, but satisfying snack places. <br />They also mark in the margin \\"Fodor's Choice\\" to help you find some of the best activities. <br /> <br />	2005-02-15

I wanted to like Jennifer, to want her to overcome the sadness from her husband's death, to find new love.  I hoped Sam's letters would be moving and vital. <br />Unfortunately the story just did not catch fire.   <br />The conversations are banal, the soon-to-die new boyfriend and other characters just never seem real.  The description of the lake, and the people don't evoke feelings in the reader.  As Jennifer reads her grandmother's letter (interspersed with her own developing romance), one learns of Sam's secret affair.  Again the people seem less than real and the reader cares little about discovering who the mysterious lover was. <br />The chapters are skimpy, the reading level suitable for an 8th grader, and the overall development of the story seems sluggish.  Needless to say, it was disappointing.  <br />I've read Harlequin romances that had more engaging characters than these.	2005-02-11

Actually her dream involved writing for the New Yorker but fetching coffee and dry cleaning for the boss seems unlikely to train her for that.  She plugs away as the job becomes all consuming and the demands from her boss grate more and more on her nerves. <br />As her relationships dwindle under the stress of the job, the conflict with the boss becomes more personalized.  Andrea becomes more and more paranoid as sleep deprivation and lack of social support turn her into a whining, unpleasant person herself. <br />Fascinating insider view of the fashion industry and working in the high-pressure NYC jobs.  Often funny, a bit romantic and eventually somewhat depressing as Andrea is dragged further and further down by the job and the horror that is her boss.	2005-01-26

The reader succumbs to that rapport with author and a well-loved place the same way as with Under the Tuscan Sun. <br />The character of New Englanders and of those drawn to its scenic shores is faithfully rendered in this book.  I envy him his time in that scenic area that he brings alive for us.

Instead we have the story of every girl who ever had a job with an incompetent boss.  Yes, it's very New York, but beneath the glitz, you get the frustration of anyone who knows they have something to contribute, but their boss won't give them the opportunity.  There's a developing romance in there too, and disillusionment about feminism and nonprofits.  The whole experience of her jobs, her bosses, her boyfriend, and the big city, all have a dehumanizing effect.  I found it interesting and compelling reading.  There's a lot going on in this book about the sexual exploitation of women, and the minimizing of women's role in the workplace.  The ending was a bit wishy-washy to me, but I won't spoil it for you.  Decide for yourself.	2005-01-04

Doug Wilson walks you through rooms he decorated (about 10 pages per room).  He explains his thinking for solving different problems in the room and meeting the owner's needs.  You really get good tips this way and it opens your mind to new possibilities. <br />The show piece rooms are very sophisticated with innovative paint treatments.  Even though the results are not something I would copy, the way of thinking and getting ideas is quite useful. <br />The last 30 pages tells you how to do some of the effects (tissue paper walls, no-sew window valance, stenciling curtains, covering a dresser in fabric, making a padded headboard). <br />Wilson has a way with words, besides being Richard-Gere handsome and familiar to many from the TV decorating shows. I'm glad this wasn't just a quickie HGTV fan book.  It really delivers some solid decorating information.	2004-12-29

Picked it up again after the holiday and zipped through to the end.  This story of two sisters and their resentments starts out strongly.  The abrupt career change of Rose from lawyer to dog-walker after being crossed in love was interesting.  Maggie's evolution from unemployable dyslexic bombshell to homeless at Harvard to darling of the geriatic set stretched the imagination.  This had a lot to recommend it, but also drawbacks in its writing.  The incidents, dialogue, and interpersonal relations captured the modern problems confronting today's contemporary young women in an urban setting.  update 1/28/05: I just finished Good In Bed by Weiner.

Sentences 25 to 35 words long are difficult to digest (and I have a masters degree).  The photo captions are grouped together, forcing the eye to jump back and forth trying to see what is being described.  Even the picture captions are such dense text that they require re-reading to figure out what the author is saying.  By page 100, I'd abandoned the text and just examined the photos.<br /><br />There are some great ideas to be gleaned from this book.

I tried to figure out why it was painful to read some of the developments.  Kinsella hits too close to home sometimes with her seemingly light story of regretful situations that everyone falls into at least once in their life.  Remember saying something unkind about someone and then turning to find them standing there?  How about postponing telling someone you have goofed and their anger when they do find out?  Kinsella makes us squirm a little as Becky goes through these situations.   <br />Happily it all works out for the best and the reader ends on an upbeat feeling.	2004-11-29

Nanny, a savvy college student, can't help bonding with her charge, Grayer, and experiences with him the pain of having disfunctional parents.  <br />They are so wrapped up in their high-powered lives, that a child is merely a nuisance to be shown off on occasion and otherwise kept out of sight. Read Nanny's descriptions of the ups and downs and how she copes with Grayer's needs and keeps her own life somewhat on track.  <br />You'll laugh - You'll cry - You'll hope they are writing another book (I just checked and their 2nd book, Citizen Girl, comes out Nov. 16).	2004-11-22

Now I can't wait to have one I own and keep it close at hand.  Each 2-3 page essay presents an idea for finding the balance and joy that most of us seek in our lives.  There are 75 of these concepts in the book and it covers many of the irritations of modern life. <br />For example, one discusses coexisting gracefully with the unresolved.  One titled \\"Stand on Ceremony\\" talks about elevating activities to a ceremonial level to enrich your daily routine. <br />Another seems mundane, \\"Make the Bed,\\" but she writes about the standard that sets for your day and the reader sees how a small action makes a difference in life.  The examples she gives are very applicable to ordinary working people. <br />What a great book!  I'm anxious to sample her other titles also.	2004-11-20

The basics include collaging, stitching, cutting doors, adding tags, folding pages, and adding inserts.

Maybe they feel the sinister villains of MHC's very popular and very suspenseful novels are too heavy for the holidays.  This has the feel of the cozy mystery, but not enough character development.  I must admit I've always been a bit disappointed when Mary Higgins Clark's latest book is just short stories or is an Alvirah and Willy story.  I'm always hoping for a new heavy duty full-length suspense novel that will worry me and keep me awake until I finish it.  Much as I wish I could give these very competent authors five stars, the story just isn't meaty enough for that.  Go ahead and give it a read, but don't get your expectations up.  Turn on the Christmas tree lights, get a cup of cocoa and zip through its 204 pages.	2004-11-19

It's a nicely packaged book with pastel pages, high quality photos and a sampling of hostess tips. The text probably equals 2 or 3 magazine articles, so I'd hate to pay $19 for it.  It gives guidelines for preparing the guest room (add hangers to the closet, flowers on the bedside table, etc.) and a sampling of recipes for impressing your guests.  They are lovely sounding (cranberry scones, strawberry iced tea, peanut butter s'mores)and the photos look good enough to eat.  Note the Martha Stewart touches like the chocolate chip cookie photo showing a well-loved teddy bear with the cookies and milk.  Along with these are some craft ideas like stamping your initial on your cocktail napkins or layering colored bath salts in a jar for the guest bath.  It even includes a couple of pages with instructions for playing charades and twenty questions.  All the ideas are pleasant enough, but overall it seems skimpy at 120 small sized pages.	2004-11-17

Their gentle predictability might make one think they will be dull, but somehow her character development teamed with loving descriptions of English and Dutch scenery creates devoted fans. <br />I've read hundreds of romances, but save only a few for rereading.  I have almost all her books carefully stacked away for a rainy day read.  The familiar plots are like comfort food and never fail to invoke a cozy feeling.   <br />Fate is Remarkable is my very favorite of all Betty Neels' books.  It is the touching story of Sarah and Hugo struggling to make their marriage of convenience work.  It really is a remarkable book to take a formula romance and turn out such a satisfying love story.	2004-11-16

It's not a travel guide, it collects 39 articles or book excerpts from diverse sources that get to the heart of Australia.   <br />You hear first-hand accounts of back packers, travel writers (Paul Theroux, Bruce Chatwin), Australians, adventurers, vacationers, and just ordinary people.  Such a wide selection lets you see Australia from many angles from the food to the people to the animals and the landscape.  This is so much more in-depth than a guidebook could possibly be.   <br />Read the harrowing account of a woman canoer who survived a crocodile attack, experience learning to surf at Bondi, ride after brumbies in the Snowy Mountains, etc.  Not all stories are heroic, as these are real people writing their impressions of a country and its amazing animals and hardy people.  Each gives their own viewpoint which makes for fascinating reading. <br />The selections vary from 5 to 20 pages, making it a great book to dip into when you don't have extended reading time. <br />I highly recommend this book.  After living in Australia 3 1/2 years, it brought back many memories of a wonderful country and showed me why I need to travel there again.	2004-11-16

This time it isn't just money troubles and my heart sank as I followed her downward spiral.  The reader really melds with Becky in this train-of-thought writing style. <br />Yes, once again Becky wants to have it all and her inability to give up the Plaza wedding extravaganza (funded by Luke's mother) gets her in trouble.  Her better side recognizes that neither can she cancel the wedding in England that her mother is pouring her heart into planning.

Instead it is a useful book on positive thinking, steps to success and growth. <br />The author, a former school principal, tells how she overcame being poor, abused, low self-esteem, divorce, widowhood, single parenthood, serious illness, loneliness and depression. <br />Although the writing style seems a bit stodgy, she presents strategies for building a support system, finding role models, developing a positive attitude, getting a mission in life, eliminating guilt, and turning failure into success.  Pretty ambitious, but if even one or two of her suggestions strikes a chord, the reader's time is well spent. <br />Each chapter ends with a list summarizing the points just covered.

Imagine yourself floundering though a totally dark cave with an ancient lamia (snake/woman combo) and three vampires after you. <br />The gore in the second book repelled me, but this time the descriptions of mayhem seemed more focused on the action and didn't wallow quite as much in blood (or maybe I'm just getting used to it). <br />Whatever...

She successfully captures some of the best Australian character traits while describing life on a sheep station and at a roadhouse where they made extended stays.   <br />Her leisurely trek revisits places and people she knew 20 years before as a school teacher (in Australia under the Assisted Passage Scheme).  This gives her the perspective to see changes to some areas (Coober Pedy) and lifestyles.   <br />This is more in depth than just a travel journal.  She comments on the struggles of the Austrailian agricultural family, racial issues and the generosity she encounters throughout the country.  One chapter describes a wide range of Down Under musicians.  A bibliography at the end gives more titles to lead you further in your reading on Australia. <br />If you are thinking about an Australian trip, this gives you much of the flavor that a guidebook just doesn't cover.	2004-10-16

At first you think it will be just one more book of organizing tips.  It's much more than that.  The author focuses on techniques not just for clearing out clutter, but on resolving personal differences in a couple's relationship that lead to the disorganization in the home.  The target audience is newly merged households, but it works for anyone moving to a new house, or for long-term relationships that still have problem areas in their home. <br />Although some of her examples end up suggesting seeing a marriage counselor, there is much the average couple can apply to their home situation and organizational problems. <br />I like the final chapter where she talks about creating a \\"sacred space\\" or a personal retreat in your home.  This goes on to involve feng shui principles which I was already reading about in other books (101 Feng Shui Tips for your Home by Webster, 10-Minute Clutter Control by Alexander.) <br />The book goes room-by-room through the house pointing out ways to improve and make it more liveable.

The events of a summer of cotton picking unfold gradually through the narration of young Luke Chandler. <br />The author creates much the same feel that you get from Rawling's The Yearling, though this is not really a coming-of-age story.  As you sit on the porch listening to the Cardinals baseball game on the radio, you become one of the family in this book. You hear the local gossip, worry about the uncle in Korea, and feel the desperation of a struggling farm family about to lose their crop. <br />The relationships and events become complex with the addition of the migrant Mexican workers, the hillbilly family and a varied neighbors and town folks. <br />I'm not quite sure what the painting of the old house was supposed to signify, but the relationships held my attention as the story flowed and unfurled through the eyes of Luke.	2004-10-05

I'd read the 2nd book in the series first, so was prepared for the gore.  There is something addictive about these books, but be forewarned it is much like reading some of Edgar Allen Poe's short stories (remember the rats in The Pit and the Pendulum?).    I'm not a vampire groupie, but something about this intrigued me into picking it up.  The author creates a whole new world within the framework of midwestern city life and police procedures.    Integrating vampires, zombies, ghouls and other oddities into regular life and then dealing with their behavior, makes a quirky new reality (imagine a \\"vampire church\\").  I found the Were-rats a bit hard to visualize, but Hamilton's descriptions of the vampires and their powers gave me the creeps.  Since that was the intent, the book works on many levels: gutsy heroine, romantic vampire interest, non-stop action, detective novel, and more.    Update 10/04 - I've since gone on to read two more in this series and have another ready to start.  You can't read just one.	2004-10-01

She covers the basics in the front of the book, explaining how clutter affects the energy and vibes in your home.  The Bagua chart was easy to apply to my layout and is clearly explained. <br />Although some of the tips seem like reruns from every \\"get organized\\" book you've ever read, most of the tips explain how the action will improve the Feng Shui that affects your relationships, wealth, creativity, etc.  Much of Feng Shui seems very practical in that the improved appearance of our homes should make us feel better and focusing on certain aspects will bring rewards in that area.  Sure, why not.   <br />I'm going to try the money jar idea in my home office which is supposed to start prosperity flowing my way.  Can't hurt.	2004-10-01

That one was easier to grasp, but this one expanded my understanding of placing the grid on my living space.  I didn't quite grasp how to use the trigrams in this book though. <br />The book gives about five pages talking about each room, then gives a page of brief tips to get you started. <br />Some of the tips seem so obvious, that you wonder what all the hype is about.  It does make you take a new look at your surroundings and creates a desire to improve on it.   <br />It was useful to me and is a book that I'll sample now and then to give me a fresh perspective on a room and its layout.	2004-10-01

The art parts I skipped and focused on the writing exercises.  Now I'm giving it another go and again it makes me think outside my usual box.  <br />Some exercises use lists, some use word association, visualizing and a variety of techniques.   <br />One exercise has you make a list of things you like about yourself.  Then make a second list of things you would like to expand or strengthen.  Then take one of the items and write out how you will actually do that in the coming week. <br />This is a good book to provide ways to explore some inner feelings and open up your thinking.	2004-09-20

The plot sounds like something straight from a paperback romance, but Heller elevates the story with her solid dialogue and snags the reader into emotionally pulling for Amy as she deals with her betrayal by her fiance and her best friend. <br />A surprise switch in narrator gives you the \\"former\\" best friend's view of the whole scenario.  Little surprizes along the way keep the reader hooked.  Enjoyable and well worth a read, but not what I would call a comedy.  Read it for some romance, some mystery, some feminine psychology and its trendy NY setting.	2004-09-16

Maybe I was looking more for quick exercises that I could use with my journal and that made me impatient with the heavy language and obscure concepts of this book.

At times it is heavy going.  If this is close to what Rawlings' actual childhood and college years were like, I'm glad I read it before now turning to her classic, Cross Creek.  I should get more from that reading with this book as background. <br />Useful mostly to scholars, students and devoted readers of The Yearling and Cross Creek. <br />I wish it had included photos of Rawlings as a child and in college and of her family.  That would have been a plus.  <br />	2004-09-10

It profiles important musicians in the history of Irish music, but I wanted more details on the recent (1970s-2000) artists. <br />The list of traditional music organizations, glossary, discography and note on session etiquette were useful. <br />Good for getting the basic background on Irish music, but I recommend taking a look at Far from the Shamrock Shore for a more emotional, yet historical look at the same topic.	2004-09-10

It is often assigned reading for teens, but I doubt that most of them can appreciate it.  Her accounts of neighbors feuding and subsistance living gives us many lessons in human behavior. <br />The lyrical descriptions of wildlife and the orange groves and wild landscape are very appealing.  Your mouth waters as you read her essays on downhome foods like hush puppies.  She turned those into a cookbook which I'll have to try out. <br />Modern readers squirm uncomfortably at her use of the N----- word and her characterization of blacks as irresponsible, drunken, immoral, etc.  It is probably a faithful representation of common thinking at the time it was written, so recognize it as a snapshot of the times.  Then move past that to luxuriate in the beautiful passages in the book.  (I deducted 1 star for this) <br />The reader becomes absorbed in Rawlings' love of the land and the creation of a home.  It gives much the same feelings as A Year in Provence or Under a Tuscan Sun.	2004-09-08

Your mind accompanies the reading with scenes from the television shows. <br />One drawback is his voice grates when handling the female lines.

I want to share this message with all the frazzled women I know.  She blends literature and a variety of religions without being preachy. Quotes from Star Wars, Bhudda, Irish proverbs and Shaker writings are sprinkled throughout serving to launch her essays. <br />Over all, it is about tuning into ourselves and paying attention to our basic needs (no, not material possessions, though she does not advocate a spartan lifestyle). <br />For women who feel there is no time to tend to their inner needs and who find the daily demands at times overwhelming, I wholeheartedly recommend this.	2004-09-08

The final trial isn't included in the book.<br /><br />  I'm sure if I were a friend or family member, it would be riveting despite these drawbacks, but for me it was not a very satisfying example of true crime writing.	2004-08-08

This is the first Laurell Hamilton book I've read and WOW, it was an eye-opener.  What a gutsy heroine, who is funny and resourceful!  Her encounters with vampires and zombies kept me on the edge of my chair.  I knew she must survive the attack by two zombies since it was early in the book, but was amazed at the action packed description of that fight scene. <br />I could handle the first murdered family and appreciated how hard it was for her to view the gore.  When it moved to the second horrifying crime scene, her attempt to be one of the boys (trying to out-tough one of the police detectives) was a bit much.  Realizing that those dealing with crime scenes must distance themselves didn't help me accept the disrespectful, gross-out contest.  It made me wonder if I really wanted to read any other Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter books. <br />Now that a few days have passed, I remember the non-stop action and witty dialogue and want to read another.  I hope I won't be sorry.  Maybe they should put out a version for the squeamish that would warn you when the gore is getting too much.	2004-08-07

Sifting out what was real, what was staged, and who was covering for someone makes it a really complex case.   <br />True crime readers will find it worth wading through.	2004-08-04

The situations of each depressed me, but the descriptions of the small town, the people and their conversations gripped me and would not let me quit.<br /><br />I felt much better towards the end as good things happened, mainly through Maggie's efforts.  Her character intercedes in several situations but I felt I really knew little about her.<br /><br />I guess I really wanted this book to be more like Ivan Doig's This House of Sky.

I recommend first reading the boxed sections in the book for each song. Then listen to that selection on the CD while reading along with the lyrics. Finish with absorbing the 2-page history lesson that accompanies each song.   Later listen to the whole CD, just soaking in the evocative Irish music.

I sure would, but reading her book gave me the chance to experience it vicariously and I thank her for that.	2004-07-12

Some turned out a bit odd or too home-made for my taste.  Who really wants a dark blue wall with silver 5-inch squares stuck on it?  I wish I could sew, then I could make a curtain out of a thrift shop dress.  It would save lots of money over shopping at Penny's or Sears.  <BR>It really does get you to thinking of transforming garage sale finds and throwing around some paint to do a budget makeover for a room.<BR>I didn't really need 13 pages listing episode-by-episode what had happened in each weekly show.  I wanted decorating ideas, not a fan club book.  Just skip past those parts and enjoy the photos and project ideas.  Happy decorating!	2004-07-09

Still I found enjoyment in many descriptions of local characters or delightful meals.  Other passages dragged a little, dwelling on insider stories that I couldn't always follow.	2004-07-09

The family background and his personal development as an student, actor and musician were very enjoyable reading.  <BR>If you liked Angela's Ashes, this will certainly appeal.	2004-07-06

That distracted from understanding how a real person could use tetrad or discordant colors.  I certainly wouldn't want a room looking like some they showed.<BR>Overall it was helpful, I just wanted more room photos showing how some of the color schemes look when applied.	2004-07-04

Instead it takes utilitarian objects like steel pipes or locknuts to make unique home decorations.<BR>Some look arty while others look just makeshift.  Some are easy while others require some handyman skills.  This really will get you to thinking outside the usual decorating, store bought stuff.  I particularly liked the back-to-back fence caps turned into candleholders.  The towel bar plus &quot;S&quot; hooks makes a great mug rack, while the upright can light teamed with a radiator grill makes a dramatic light stand for an end table. <BR>Give it a try, for some unique projects.	2004-07-04

Each one of us must cope as best we can with family illness and eventual loss, but it is interesting seeing his ways of dealing with it. <BR>A slim 194 pages, so it's a quick read.  Recognizing our parents personal needs, but constrained by financial and physical burdens, it will be hard to handle their slide from vital active people, into dependents.<BR>Reading individual accounts like this gives us some mental and emotional preparation.	2004-07-04

Tuscan Retreat sounded like a reasonable substitute, but I found it only mildly entertaining.    I had to skim past some ponderous passages on British politics and name dropping to find the 1960's era descriptions of retirement life and the Tuscan countryside, people and lifestyle.	2004-06-26

Returning to the Gulf Coast with that powerful story in mind, I could more fully appreciate the warnings and preparations for the impending tropical storm/hurricane churning in the Gulf.  The book details the horrendous effect of the 1900 hurricane on Galveston.<BR>The next time they forecast a hurricane, read this book during the 2 or 3 days it approaches the coast. The author sets the scene of the fledgling Weather Bureau, the promise of thriving Galveston, and the lives of the people enjoying their seaside city.  Knowing that over 8,000 people lost their lives makes the build up to the hurricane even more ominous.  <BR>The descriptions grip you, the scientific details of weather fit into the story seamlessly, while scenes of the tremendous battering by wind, rain and sea are horrifying.  Even more horrifying is the aftermath of the storm with aid slow in coming and the dazed residents who managed to survive overwhelmed by the needed clean up effort.<BR>Who would have thought that weather reports could be so gripping.	2004-04-11

Not Angela's Ashes and not a history of Ireland, but combines some elements from both.  I enjoyed it much more than Midlife Irish which I read about the same time.	2004-04-11

These three stories transported me to the Emerald Isle with their romance, Irish lore and magic.  I read straight through from one story to the next.  I'll definitely look for more Nora Roberts to read and not wait for next March.	2004-04-11

If you read it seeking the feeling of Ireland, there are some nice descriptive moments in the book.  Mostly it focuses on the author whose life and celebrity contacts did not make up for my disappointment in the skimpiness on Astaire and Ireland.<BR>   I recommend instead titles by Niall Williams or reread Frank McCourt.	2003-04-28

Elsie Lee just has a light way with her characters that hooks me.  They are fun, talented and always sound like someone you would enjoy meeting.<BR>Great setting (German castle) and convoluted plot (kidnapping, Nazi uprising) that the heroine handles deftly.	2003-04-24

Reading level is for an older child, but the overtly cute sprites and rather tame stories may not appeal to that age group.  Art work is rather clumsy, detracting from the books potential.<BR>On the positive side, there are a variety of techniques that might spark ideas for teachers and librarians who do storytelling.  The crafts have easy-to-follow instructions.  The Read More About It sections include useful bibliographies, websites and resources.	2003-03-11

This briefs you on gemstones at auction.  The publisher, Gemstone Press, has comprehensive guides on diamonds, pearls, etc. that are more in-depth as well.  Convenient to have it all in one book, but keep in mind these limitations.<BR>Excellent color photo section, helpful drawings, great charts.  Probably a good starting title for this area, but I'd want to read more books before venturing into buying and selling gems at auction.	2003-03-11

Skim the first chapter, and then get to the heavy duty stuff comparing methods of road repair and varied techniques for different problems.  Useful for rural residents struggling with disintegrating driveways.  Great charts and a glossary.	2003-03-11

The collection contains many well-known tales including &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;The Princess and the Glass Mountain&quot;, and &quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot;.      Most readers will be less familiar with the other tales from fifteen countries.

After reading Angela's Ashes and Dublin Girl, I craved more gritty Irish  memoirs.  Unfortunately this seemed disjointed and self-indulgent to me.   Many of the author's trials seemed self-inflicted, in contrast to the  poverty and family tribulations exposed by the other writers.	1998-08-24

Treat yourself to this wonderful book.	1998-08-01
