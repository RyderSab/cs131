A magnificently engrossing story that takes place over several years and including many twists and turns that make it difficult to write a review that does not give away too much of the plot.  It starts with a war injury that brings amnesia induced loss of identity to our main character.  The life that he builds from scratch is washed away when a car accident brings back his earlier memory, while losing the memory of his most recent life and identity.  The two identities are quite dissimilar making it most difficult for the love of his second life to trace him once again to where he has built an entire life upon his early roots.  The clash of his two identities and what he does with the women from both his lives is the crux of the book.  Both his lives are truly worthwhile and if only there were a way to combine the best of both parts - but impossible to go back . . . the eventual answer is one of the most breathtakingly satisfying conclusions of all time.    James Hilton's (Goodbye Mr. Chips, Lost Horizon) greatest novel.  A romance for the ages.  If still possible for you, this is one time the book should definitely be digested before the movie (also great but substantially different).	2005-09-07

David Baldacci is a brilliant writer whose books are riveting mysteries with heart-pounding suspense - and whose plots are impossibly unreal.  But no other recent author I know of delivers more satisfying and entertaining escapism.    At first glance LuAnn Tyler, 20-yr old single mom, appears to be trailer court trash going nowhere.  We learn to care and root for her while she partakes in a mysterious someone's scheme of swindling themselves into a lottery super-jackpot. Though she initially refuses, a murder charge against her devolves from inexplicable events to put her on the run for her life, seemingly forcing her into acquiescing to the plan in exchange for rescue.      Fast forward to 10 years later.  Building on almost unnoticed seeds strewn throughout the first part of the story, we now see a woman who has steadily grown and educated herself to have become a powerful and supremely capable self-determinant  force.  The characterizations of the main protagonists are devotedly well drawn (great romance story within); the \\"bad guy\\" is chillingly constructed to appear unstoppable.  The story's culmination is instigated by an investigative newspaper reporter and FBI curiosity that strips her of her protective anonymity.  LuAnn has several instantaneously vital friend-or-foe decisions to make and a hide-and-seek chase sequence before the blood-pounding final confrontation.	2005-09-07

The unexpected complication is a burglarizing P.I. (Lee Adams) who frustrates the assassination and rescues the damsel in distress.  Congress is involved as well as the CIA and FBI.  The 451 page adventuresome chase is through double-crossing who-can-you-trust terrain.  The romance is unsurprising, typical, and some of the best dialog.  The 'run and hide for your  life' is great suspense.  The counter attack/sting is pure Baldacci brilliance.  Saving Faith gives you a front-row seat to a great adventure/mystery but doles out the background details necessary to full understanding one plot twist at a time.	2005-09-07

Douglas paean to 'Private Courage'	Douglas turns his theology of self-effacing good works to what he calls \\"private courage\\" in this absorbing story.  College professor Paul  Ward has invented a refrigeration unit to replace ice boxes, but has his idea stolen by another.  Embittered, he sinks into discouragement.  Hannah, the most mysterious housekeeper this side of Mary Poppins, talks him into losing his bitterness by privately and in-person forgiving his enemy.  About the time he hits near bottom, Paul does so and the ensuing freedom and renewed energy has him starting over perfecting an even more advanced unit, and being available as a husband and father as never before.    Similar experiences occur for the other members of the family, as each turns to Hannah and learns for themselves that the turning point in their life requires this \\"private courage\\" to set them free for further glory.  At the book's end, when Hannah is asked to go through what seems more than humanly possible, all the ones she has helped before gather to cheer her towards the story's culminating act of \\"Private Courage\\".    You can count on Lloyd C. Douglas books to be inspirational detailed sympathetic character studies.  White Banners grandly upholds this tradition in 400 engrossing pages.	2004-12-23

A church friend helps her land a job as a housekeeper to Alec Riley.  Alec has lost his wife in a car crash.  He reacts by desperately turning himself into a workaholic and emotionally abandons his three children (ages 16, 12, 10) to wander in their own pain-filled daze.  Sophie arrives and wonderful life-changing mayhem ensues.  Sophie's tenuous grasp of English helps fill this book with laugh-out-loud humor and all five main characters have fully developed story lines that entices the reader right into the family.  You will live the story with them.    This is in my estimation, Lori Wick's greatest book so far.  But her rate of maturity as a writer has been such that I doubt that will last.  The large print hardcover is 642 pages of delightfully entertaining inspiration. I did not want it to end.	2004-12-23

Grace Livingston Hill's books are always inspirational romantic tearjerkers in the best sense, but this one may take first prize for that description.  It is quixotic in its idealism, but carries you right along inside the vision.<br />Charlie, near the closing days of WWII has volunteered for a suicide mission and decides that just before he leaves, he must visit Blythe and confess his lifelong love for her.  They have but a few moments to speak in person.  Just long enough for the amazing revelation that this idealistic love has captured them both.  After Charlie leaves, they have time for two phone calls and letters before he starts his mission expecting to never return.<br />There will be no surprises about the ending, but the journey along the way is about how the attempt on both their parts to live up to the highest ideals of their (doomed) love propels them to acts of mercy and understanding of God.  They experience awestruck wonder at many of the revelations that this relationship unveils.  Family and friends are swept along in the life-changing rush of emotional and spiritual derring-do.<br />Very much a product of its time and plenty of romance, patriotism, and Godliness.  You will be entertained, moved and inspired.	2004-01-08

Tells the story of Patricia, from grade school through young womanhood, as she tries to find herself and her place in life.  Her mother and social circle push her in directions she does not wish to go and she at first resists without knowing why, but after awhile finds it easier to just go along.  In the end Patricia is forced to choose between accepting what almost everyone seems to say she should do, or to follow a secret dream that even she thinks unreal.  But she hangs on until the day comes that she has a real choice.<br />The two main villains in this book are more threatening than usual for GLH.  Dramatic ending, even though expected, will make you cheer through the tears.	2003-12-22

I've read 60 of her books so far and I believe this to be the most well written in terms of beautifully soaring prose, poetical love notes, inspiring life-changing conversions and engaging secondary characters.  Such a delight that I wish there were a sequel to this one.  <br />Love-at-first-sight on best man John Saxon's part as he espies Mary Elizabeth walk up the isle as maid-of-honor.  She drives him to the train station after the wedding as he blurts out his love.  As Mary tries to find out all about him from his friends, they embark on a long-distance correspondence.  By the time they see each other again, their lives have become gloriously entangled.<br />Told from the standpoint of both lovers (more from Mary), and key mutual friend of theirs, a well-developed early-teen character.  More humor than usual from GLH.  Best written of what I've seen so far, and tied for my favorite of hers with about eight other stories.	2003-12-03
