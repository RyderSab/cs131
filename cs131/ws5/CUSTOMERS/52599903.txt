Jane was a  little too &quot;holier than thou&quot; for my taste but given the times  when women were repressed and treated as little more than property,  understandable.  Good book. Will read more by this author.	2000-07-08

I read this book in a day and did not want it to end (anymore than I wanted the others to end).  I hope, no pray that a book on the mysterious Justin and Lawe is on its way.  I hate loose ends.

It always amazes me that I actually feel the characters pain and that I cry while I am reading Ms. Lowell's books.  She is either a very talented writer or I am sorely in need of a life (both!). I read this book before I  realized it was book 2 of the trilogy. I am curently reading Untamed and I  am sure I will enjoy it and Enchanted as much as I enjoyed this one.	2000-04-10

I agree with a previous reviewer that a book about Lord Daregate and Anne Silverthorne would be interesting. I love Ms. Quick's sense of humor and the very &quot;proper&quot; language. I  love a book that makes me laugh out loud and these books do.  I do not know  when Ms. Quick's last book was published but I hope to see more...soon.	2000-04-01

Annie's ignorance was understandable given the circumstances of her &quot;life&quot; before Alex. Contrary to what another reviewer stated,  Alex is not a wimp. He was caring and sensitive, maybe a little too good to  be true but not a wimp. If only he was real!  This is my first but not my  last Catherine Anderson book.	2000-02-15
