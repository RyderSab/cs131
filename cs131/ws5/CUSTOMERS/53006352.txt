The two reasons why are that I read it twice, the second time being as soon as I initially finished it, which I haven't done more than a handful of times in my life.  The other reason is the book stops in the middle and starts again, thereby giving the reader two perfect books in one. <br /> <br />The only thing I'm certain of about this book is that Sr. Plascencia has presented something never done in literature before.  I'm fully confident no one will honestly say this book is like anything read previously. <br /> <br />Of course, Sr. Plascencia also demonstrates a first-rate command of language, thematic structure that smoothly straddles so many genres it's barely containable by description, and unforgettable characters.  That alone makes for great literature.   <br /> <br />But there's more, and that's why this book is an instant classic -- a term I do not lightly toss for sake of impact and mean will be studied by scholars 100 years on.   <br /> <br />This writer tells the truth, albeit in a fashion heretofore never ventured. <br /> <br />I'll not spoil the plot here.  But I can offer no higher praise than to admit the second reading was more satisfying, and I'm confident the third will yield yet deeper appreciation. <br /> <br />If this book doesn't clean up every literary award this year, someone please explain why not.	2005-09-25

But after you've read it, you'll probably agree.  It's that good and also easy to read.  What is more, it's a new way of seeing the Fab Four than can be found  in previous books.  This is a genuine insider's perspective, that of the band's childhood and lifelong chum Tony Bramwell. <br /> <br />Mr. Bramwell doesn't pull punches.  His is a straight shot of what he's seen and done, from the beginnings of The Beatles to their rise to the pinnacle of pop culture, through the band's painful demise, and beyond into their highly successful solo careers.  His insights are fresh and reveal colorful facets heretofore unknown. <br /> <br />Each Beatle is given about equal weight through the book.  As a quartet their sound made them inseparable.  In reality they were four very different personalities, albeit high ambitious and superlatively creative.  At no time does Tony disrespect John, Paul, George or Ringo.  On the other hand, he doesn't sugar-coat their shortcomings. <br /> <br />Mr. Bramwell doesn't pussyfoot where the brutal truth needs be told.  Some people, especially Yoko and Allen Klein, are blasted for their very calculated, mean and destructive impact on The Beatles, both as a band and individually.  These passages reek of rot.  In contrast Linda McCartney is shown as a supportive companion for her beloved husband through the unimaginable pressure of leaving The Beatles. <br /> <br />Other core characters in The Beatles career are portrayed as all-to-human but who had excellent intentions.  Brian Epstein is the most underrated manager in history, and this book builds a strong case why he should be inducted into the Rock 'N' Roll Hall of Fame's non-performer category.  George Martin is confirmed as a studio genius. <br /> <br />Along the way, we also get Bramwell's first-hand accounts of hanging and working with Jimi Hendrix, The Stones, The Who, Eric Clapton, Phil Spector, Ray Charles, Marianne Faithful, Bruce Springsteen, Elvis and so many other legends. <br /> <br />The undercurrent chronicles the birth of pop culture, from Swinging London in the '60s to the New York/L.A. scenes of today. It's a fine social commentary on one level. <br /> <br />Did I forget to mention sex and drugs?  Mama, there's plenty of that in this book, but -- hey!! -- we already knew that fact.  The book's real value is its people and the music they made.	2005-06-02

At the Post: The 20th Century in Sports from Famed Washington Post:  Columnist Shirley Povich	Books	5	11	11	N	N	The Soul of Sports Journalism	Rarely does a book take me very long to read, especially when its composed of a series of short pieces such as newspaper columns.  Journalism isn't supposed to be literature, and sports writing particularly is mainly to give the doggone scores. <br /> <br />Then again, calling Mr. Povich a sportswriter is about as accurate as calling the Pope a good man. <br /> <br />Mr. Povich was the genuine soul of the almighty Washington Post, perhaps the most principled writer ever to grace the pages of any newspaper's sports section.  He belongs in the very rare and esteemed company of great journalists such as Cronkite, Mencken, Twain and pehaps a few others.   <br /> <br />Yeah, these pieces give you the story.  What's more, you get the story behind the story.  And it's done in language a 13-year-old can read and understand. <br /> <br />Knowing perfectly well how special this collection is, I read it as slowly as possible.  Why rush a good thing?  I'm sure Mr. Povich had to fight the daily deadline pressures to produce the work.  The least we can do is savor his command of language and keen insight into human character.	2005-05-14

Such was the case with Dave Van Ronk's contribution to the great 1964 Elektra compendium of folk and blues, The Blues Project.  Mr. Van Ronk performed \\"Bad Dream Blues,\\" and my life was altered forever.  This song is the yardstick of excellence by which I measure so much other American music from Dylan to Chapin to Springsteen. <br /> <br />Had he been with a powerhouse label like Columbia, Mr. Van Ronk would have become a household name. <br /> <br />This book focuses on the source of the genius.  The particular blend of time, location, and current events combined to produce a fertile opportunity for singer-songwriters.  And to my ears, Mr. Van Ronk was at the pinnacle of importance.   <br /> <br />Mr. Van Ronk may've been The Mayor on the world's most vital street of the folk scene during its heights, but among artists he's royalty.	2005-04-26

If you laugh at Mr. Crumb, you better make doggone sure you ain't taking your-own-self too seriously. <br /> <br />There isn't anyway to begin describing this book.  Each page jumps up and slaps your around equally.  Lots of our old favorites are included, but the thing that is most vital to me as a reader are the solutions Mr. Crumb proposes.  Like it or no, he has a keen sense of life's fairness, inequities, balance and absurdity.  <br /> <br />Anyone can bitch, few can propose workable answers.

The writing is easy-to-digest and prsents facts without a lot of editorializing.  What's more like all respectable reporters, Mr. Burke has the good sense to stay out of the way of his subjects' point of view. <br /> <br />These are character portraits for today's generation, those of us who've come to rely on USA Today's \\"McStory\\" format of concise data, \\"I'm busy; gimme the facts.\\"  I enjoyed the sampler of such diverse talents whose impact spans history, gender, and stylistic approaches. <br /> <br />It's rather doubtful, if wishful thinking, but a Volume Two would certainly be worth my time and interest.

City-by-city, day-by-day we get the oft off-center musing of one of today's genuine comic geniui (is this plural of genius?). <br /> <br />We see the towns and venues and audiences from the performer's perspective, which provides some keen insight into the way his unique point of view evolves.  After reading this, I think of Eric as a friend rather than a sleb.  He's honest and witty.  But what is more, he's also not impressed with his star stature in the entertainment industry. <br /> <br />Hanging with Mr. Idle is quite imossible for most of us.

Her personality and character impressed me as an unfinished work, albeit one in progress and not yet fully matured.  Her point-of-view on CDs and in concerts continued to evolve, and I was constantly measuring her growth with that initial contact. <br /> <br />With the release of this book, however, I've come to see Ms. Amos as perhaps the woman who'll accept the relay baton from Joni Mitchell as the generation's best well rounded female artist. <br /> <br />Yes, I use the gender qualifier, and in the most positive and appreciative sense.  As a male I need the keen insight of a strong female to show me what they instinctively and inherently realize.  Don't simply tell me about your perspective -- make it real! <br /> <br />Thank you, Ms. Amos.  Count on me to stay interested in your constantly expanding career and growth as an artist.	2005-02-27

When the subject is an artistic giant, they generally seem compelled to report \\"new\\" or \\"previously unknown\\" scandals to keep readers interested.   <br /> <br />But not this book.  The authors have dutifully and truly captured the unique essence of Howlin' Wolf.  In short, it is not only the definitive bio of the artist and the man, but it might well rank as one of the best and most loving comprehensive studies of anyone in music. <br /> <br />After decades of listening to Wolf's music, and reading tons o' material about him, I approached this book with no small degree of caution.  Would it be tawdry?  Would it simply rehash facts?

The formula was done by E-Street drummer Max Weinberg in The Big Beat, where he interviewed top percussionists.  For years it's continued to call to me for yet another reading.  I suspect this book will produce similar reactions.  There's way too much to absorb all-at-once, even though the book reads so quickly you have to pace yourself down. <br /> <br />The lineup is stellar.  Understandably, my particular favorite interviews are those on my favorite artists.  R.L. Burnside is worth the price of the book alone.  But the artist I most was pleasantly surprised by is Taj Mahal.  He's far more articulate than I'd've imagined, causing me to retreat to his CD catalogue and re-explore his depth and scope of musical influences. <br /> <br />This is blues made accessible.  But don't misinterpret that statement as \\"blues lite.\\"  This book's subjects are substantive and worthy.  It's a mighty fine tribute to these deserving artists. <br /> <br />Perhaps the nicest aspect is how Elwood Blues stays out of the way of his subjects and lets them occupy center-stage, where they justly belong.  In the hands of lesser authors, the book coulda easily become a \\"look at me interviewing a living legend\\" mess.	2004-11-24

Darn-sure qualifies as one of the Top 5 of all time, for that matter.  And speaking of the matter, this is the most painfully pleasant description of the music biz's sorry-ass state ever put on paper. <br /> <br />Anyone who ever has even remotely dreamed of making it in a band (HELLO-OOO all you folks) must read this book.  Mr. McCormick pulls no punches.  He shovels the blame on incompetentcy, including his own.  He documents the rise from gymnasium cover band to the most exhaulted level stardom by his school chums in U2, particularly Bono to whom he remains close. <br /> <br />The comparison and contrast could not delineate a clearer gap. <br /> <br />The writing reads as rapidly as a Ramones song: \\"onetotreefo\\" so you never get the slightest bit bored or anxious over the author's misguided efforts and tragicomic outcomes.  How many ways can a band win in the music biz?  Well, there's only one way things work when you're successful.  How many ways can things get screwed up?  Incalculable. <br /> <br />A modern classic is what we got with this.  Sadly, I don't know if the ol' boy has anything left for a follow-up of substance.

This undoubtedly will stand as one of the most comprehensive studies of one of the world's most famous and justifiably enduring bands.   <br /> <br />If anything negative can be claimed, it's simply that no detail is too minor for inclusion.  The book is ideal for completists, those who thrill in every tiny aspect of The Beach Boys.  For my taste, it's a lot to absorb.  But that's not to say the book is less than brilliant in presenting the facts, personalities, ups/downs, ins/outs, and evolution of popular music. <br /> <br />The Beach Boys deserve such scholarly attention. That Mr. Badman has presented the data in a fun and easy-to-read manner parallels the joy of the music.  Never dry, never dull. <br /> <br />The other commendation due is that even the many things that failed or missed the mark are presented.  Yes, this book is a work of love.

Having worked promotions for a two well-known international record labels, Mr. Slichter's brilliant book is no fantasy but a realistic explanation of the music biz.  His observations are spot-on about radio, recording, promotions, merchandising, retail, concert promoters, and fans. <br /> <br />The book should be required reading for any band hoping to get a record deal.  Chances are they won't make a lot of money, but they sure-as-hell will spend a lot.  And the expenses aren't even for the supposedly fun things like 5-star hotels, private  Gulfstream jets, vintage Cristel and parties with supermodels.  Oh no, the cash flows out to independent promotions, recording costs, and dozens of other \\"necessities.\\" <br /> <br />The book shows how a band can \\"ship\\" millions of \\"units\\" (as opposed to selling records) and still wind up losing hundreds of thousands of dollars. <br /> <br />Mr. Slichter also proves something about the wisdom of everyone in the recording process.  If they actually knew how to score a hit, every song would be one.  Truth: there is no real formula for a hit record, and even less of one to determine which songs really sell at retail once they do manage to get on radio, MTV or VH1. <br /> <br />Touring for a starting band can be a grisly existence.  What we have here is a handbook for survival -- or at least an outline of how to cope with life on the road during a band's early days.  Every band that gets a record contract probably imagines it'll be the next Led Zeppelin once the tour dates and cash start adding up.  Surprize! <br /> <br />Mr. Slichter ought to be remembered far longer for his book than for any of his notable accomplishments in Semisonic.  He's witty.  He's accurate.  He's definitely been there. <br /> <br />Most of all, Mr. Slichter's highly readable.  Stylistically imagine a kinder and gentler Hunter S.

Having surfed more than 40 years, nothing captures my interest better than a good story about riding waves.  I just read this book on Cape Hatteras, NC while on vacation surfing waves generated by Hurricanes Alex and Charley.  Still, it wasn't just my personal environment that made this book perfect.  It woulda had the same impact if I'd read it in February in Montana.  And never been in the ocean. <br /> <br />The novel will instantly stand as one of the Top Five all-time surfing stories.  There is a terrific underlying current in the book, which non-surfers might neither understand nor be aware of.  Mr. Nunn, defines his characters in an amazing way, using surfing's wide divide between old school (my style) and the new generation (my sons' outlook).  Approaches to the waves are almost polar, even while the sport's inherent values and respect for tradition are from the same template. <br /> <br />On the surface, this novel also is a who-done-it thriller that shows Mr. Nunn is a genuinely exceptional writer who displays equal parts Elmore Leonard, Hunter S. Thompson, and John Grisham. <br /> <br />Intricate details, believeable characters, and conversational dialogue add up to a read that moves along as quickly and with as much unpredictability as a 20-foot storm wave.   <br /> <br />Cowabunga, old-timers!

That's the good news.  His keen perspective and rabid style leaves no one in his sights unsplattered.   <br /> <br />I just don't know what it signifies that ol' HST's once-so-flamboyant approach today seems so -- well, routine is probably the word.  Maybe I've gotten used to all the sex and violence and other recreational abuses in his writing.  What seemed so outlandish in the 70s just doesn't rev my emotional engines these days. <br /> <br />Can it be that HST is no longer the far left of news reporting and that Gonzo has become the yardstick by which journalism is now simply measured?  He's less an engine than a baromter. <br /> <br />Still well worth the time to read and think, a new HST book is like running into an old girlfriend.  You're sure glad to see her again but soon wonder what it was that made you fall in love with her all those years ago. . . <br /> <br />	2004-07-30

No job in rock 'n' roll ever demanded more sense of rhythm that Mr. Entwistle's.  The freewheeling guitar style of Peter Townshend, the ultra-dynamic approach of Keith Moon (and those who followed on the skins), and Roger Daltry's fluid vocals certainly needed a Gilbrater of Rock to anchor their sound. <br /> <br />Preventing a runaway train wreck was Ox. <br /> <br />His life with the bass guitar resulted in one of the world's top collections, lovingly presented in magnificent color and display here.  The concise commentary about each guitar is just enough to categorize it, place it in historical context of The Who or musical style, and reveal an intimacy about the artist himself. <br /> <br />I love this book.	2004-07-26

Kiss and tell books are just too juicy to pass on, and a reader can drown in all the name-dropping here.<br />Walter Yetnikoff's first-person account of the development of CBS Records, and the zenith of the music biz are simply spellbinding.  It's an easy and terrific read, a fascinating story, and great fun.<br />WY takes no prisioners.  He writes about Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, James Taylor and Bruce Springsteen with an irreverence equal to what he tells of his own shortcomings.<br />His contemporaries who shaped the music business are Clive Davis, David Geffin, Tommy Mottola and Ahmet Ertegun.  None hides from WY's light of truth. He isn't mean-spirited, just brutally honest.<br />Was excess in the rock 'n' roll industry of the 70's and early 80's a myth or fact?  You decide:<br />Drink?  By the barrel.<BR>Drugs? Enough to float Columbia's economy.<BR>Sex? Hugh Hefner never had it so good.<BR>Money?  Bill Gates and Ted Turner, for all they have, are duds when it comes to enjoying a lifestyle beyond decadence.<br />WY knew he was living a fantasy and didn't deny himself any of the many and mind-boggling opportunities presented. <br />Yeah, admit it.  Who wouldn't want to live the life WY appears to have had during the good ol' days at CBS Records?  <BR> <BR>WY was fortunate to have been there before Sony took over or the industry started being run by accountants who wouldn't know a hit record or fun if it crawled into bed with them.<br />I can't really decide if it's accurate to credit WY for CBS Records' success.  Perhaps he was just the right-type crazy when things went straight to the top.  Either way, there's no disputing the company and entire music industry did reach its pinnacle on his watch, though.<br />C'mon back Walter.  The sorry excuse that's today's record business needs a straight double-shot of your brand of insanity.  Rock is about rebellion and edge and attitude.  What we now have is Justin, Brittany and Janet and yet nobody at the labels can understand why the industry is sucking.<br />I'd love to see what the publisher and lawyers wouldn't let WY put in his book.  Somehow, as wild he's Howling At The Moon, I bet this is the sanitized version of what he coulda given us.	2004-03-06

Tobie Gene provides an interesting perspective on the Old South and the rise of Blacks in America.  Along the way beatnicks, hippies, urban revolutionaries, Hells Angels, and other counterculture segments of society are respectfully given proper narriative.<br />Most of all, the real reason to read this book is fun.  Words fly off the pages faster than a chopped Harley.  Every page reveals yet more interesting details about bike riders and their clubs.  As a society open only to Blacks and Harley riders, the East Bay Dragons M.C. has maintained its status as one of our nation's oldest, most formidable organizations.<br />Here's the real test: I haven't riden in more than 30 years since the last time I put a bike down in traffic and thought it was the end.  I'm white and from the east coast.  There aren't too many similarities on the surface between the Dragons and me.<br />Nonetheless, as the book unfolds I can wholly identify with the spirit of the Dragons without having to stretch my imagination.<br />That's what I call an engaging book.	2004-01-23

Sting's music, for my taste, has become rather formulated and predictable, albeit very good.  I like to call him the Neil Diamond of today's generation.  <br />So how in the world did he write this amazing book?<br />Technically, it's a steady read that keeps you engaged from page one to the last word.  The stories cohere and build an intimate profile of one of the world's foremost performers.  It's the ultimate backstage access.<br />To his credit, Sting speaks with equal honesty about his triumphs and falls, which cover a wide scope of emotional territory.  He is proud of his education and artistry but just as open about his professional failures.  His failures as a son are balanced with his ongoing internal search for truth and breakthrough.  He reveals himself as a typical father who examines his wants against limitations.<br />Most of all, Sting is exceedingly kind to all his musical mates, performers and management.  If you're looking for a punative kiss and tell about the breakdown of The Police, you won't find it here.  He openly credits the momumental contributions of Steward Copeland and Andy Summers, in addition to those who assisted his earliest attempts to become a professional musician.<br />I only have two drawbacks.<br />1. The books opens in Brazil during a religious experimentation with drugs.  I could never tell if the entire book is endorsing drugs for &quot;medicinal&quot; purposes.<br />2. The last Sting concert I attended was superb.  But he quit playing 14 minutes before the amphitheater's curfew, leaving a sold-out audience wondering why he didn't use that time to give us a few more favorite songs.  Same here.  Sting comes up before the finish line, leaving us wondering what he could have offered with a touch more effort and a better contract with his loyal fans.<br />Read the book!	2003-11-21

Prior to this amazing book, Hunter S. Thompson was the undisputed monarch of Gonzo journalism.  And Lester Bangs was his counterpart in music criticism.  <br />Their storytelling was channeled through massive quantities of drugs and sex and rock 'n' roll and drugs and drugs (they liked drugs) weaving wild tales of life and adventure.  Yep, 'ol HST and Les, I sure-enough hear Neil Pollack knockin' at the door.<br />To describe this book in a word: outlandish!  A brilliant voice tells the (you really want to believe) story-behind-the-story.  Even though it's all a farce, I couldn't help loving every word.  Every punctuation mark, for that matter.  And I don't even like the guy, much less completely agree with his point of view.  <br />Somehow, virtually every major rock artist and event get chronicled with Pollack dead-center on the action.  Elvis gave him his non-Jewish name at his bar mitzva.  He and Dylan hung tight in the early days.  Along the way Pollack also influences The Rolling Stones, Hendrix, Lou Reed, Bowie and Iggy Pop, The Sex Pistols, Springsteen, and Kurt Cobain -- and a the prime component at Monteray Pop, Woodstock, and the Fillmore -- amongst lots of others.<br />Be forewarned.  Proceed very carefully here.  You might make a mistake and assume this is a casual read because the story simply flys along at the speed of -- well pure crystal meth, I suppose.  Nuh-uh!  No sir-re-bob-a-roo!  This here book's the making of a monumnental new member of Gonzo journalism at its damnable best.<br />Roll over Lester Bangs and tell Hunter S. Thompson the news.	2003-10-28

There are times in this book when I suspected both.  But what-the-hey, Mr. Kane was there and I wasn't so I'm in for the whole ride.  The book definitely bridges the gap between factual reporting (which Mr. K undoubtedly was and is) and the fantasy we all share about complete access to celebrities at their peak.  I often felt I knew Mr. K better than his subjects, so tightly woven is the fabric of this tale.  Nonetheless, many excellent conversations illuminate the innocence of the period.  How could anyone have truly known what The Beatles tours would do to change the course of entertainment?  How can anyone imagine what the world would be like had there never been The Beatles and subsequent dual conquests of the States?  These platforms alone are amazing foundations upon which to build this story.  And the celebrated Mr. K superbly utilized his opportunity-of-a-lifetime.	2003-10-07

He's been in the middle of it for decades, rather than taking the soft and easy approach to the entertainment biz.  And I, for one, am doggone glad of it.  You might disagree with Charlie, and he respects your right to.  But at least he has the gumption to stand up for what he believes and tell the world.  He's an unashamed patroit.  And while even I find some of his positions in conflict with my own, I can honestly say he's given a lot more thought to life than hoping for the next hit song.  The book's only detraction is a bit of redundancy on themes.  But my daddy was a schoolteacher, and he always told me it's a three-step process&quot; 1) tell somebody what you're gonna tell 'em, 2) tell 'em,, and 3) tell 'em what you told 'em.

But what a great read to actually have a first-person account of the band personalities' strengths and frailties.  Rarely does a rock book offer the insight into the people behind the music.  If anything, the music is simply explained by matter-of-factly saying it was mostly superior in concert.  That, we already knew.  The interesting part to me is the behind-the-backstage scenes, times even an All Access pass was worthless.  Clearly, this is written from one point of view but after 30 years, that perspective has been forged into a solid understanding of the dynamics required to maintain the Grateful Dead industry.  Best of all, the book's pages just fly by.  It reads more like a pulp novel than a biography.  In summary, I'll never hear &quot;We can share the women, we can share the wine&quot; and think of the band in the same way again. . .	2003-10-01

But lest anyone misunderstand the depth and scope of Mr. Hart's broad musical background, this book should be considered essential reading. He has painstakingly researched and documented recorded music in a way that I quite honestly never considered in any formal way. Best of all, he's illuminated the historical process and power of recorded music on a global platform, all-the-while presenting it in the most readble and accessible manner. I believe this is the best of Mr. Hart's many outstanding books on music. No wonder he works for the Smithsonian. Scholarly, yes. Boring, not for a single word.	2003-08-12

Making sense of this is a writing task from hell.  Presenting the story in the same down-to-earth language and approach of the Carters' humble Virginia roots is genius!<br />The book moves slowly, but is never dull.  Reading cadence is at the same tempo of the time period and the Carters as musicians and artists.<br />Thank you co-writers for this genuine treasure.  It's one of the definitive studies of a legendary American family and the raw beginnings of our entertainment world.

We're fascinated by a wreck on the highway and cannot help but look.  It's the same way when reading about Iggy Pop.  The book is most journalistic in its objectivity. And that ain't bad.  Mr. Pop's story is quite sensational enough when told matter-of-factly.  We sure don't need someone who is in love with the insanity and celebrity that embody this lifestyle.  <br />I genuinely enjoyed the book, having read it purely out of curosity more than anything else. I don't even own a single CD by Mr. Pop, although I'm certainly aware of his body of work, not to mention rock 'n' roll reputation for excess.<br />So, like a multi-car pile-up on the boulevard, I hadta look.  But at the same time my interest is laced with a sense of saddness and sorrow for those involved.  <br />I'll add this: it's probable that lesser rock mortals have died for far fewer indulgences.

Brilliant works by Young are championed, whereas the music and other stuff that fails is given equal time in the spotlight.  The real treasuer is Young's personal thoughts and feelings.  As much as I admire Neil Young as an artist, after reading this book I'm not sure I'd wish to drive cross-country with him.  The definite source on Neil Young.	2002-07-23

I had the supreme honor of working for Atlnatic Records as a promotions Manager in the '70s, so I saw first-hand a lot of what's in this book.  I saw it through the label, the artists, radio and retail.  And lemme tell you, the book is spot-on accurate.  The two words that best describe Atlantic Records are sophisticated and engaged, and those characteristics come top-down from the founder, Mr. Ahmet Ertegun, and through all of his management.  <br />While the book is an amazing account of Atlantic Records, what is more is the indispensable perspective on the music business at large.  For anyone even remotely interested in the history of this industry and its artists, this book is vital.<br />The cost is a bit pricey, but the old saying you get what you pay for has never been more true.  The oversized book features fantastic photography and superb quality.  I just wish it would have had included a 30-song sampler of the history of Atlantic artists.	2002-02-01

Like so many millions of fans, his songs touched my very soul, and still do today.  It was through this biased lens that I read this book.  The events of Otis's short life have been well documented by now, but never so fully before.  Readers get to know the real Otis in all his majesty and faults.  Time heals all wounds, and its easy to forget the impact Otis's death had.  Similarly time dulls memories of accomplishments, and lest we ever forget Otis's many contributions I hope this book will find a wide audience.  The research has been done with painstaking care.  The writing manages to stay objective, even through the author obviously is deeply involved in his subject.  Thank you for this work.  It's a book I'll read again every few years, just as surely as I return to Otis's recordings regularly to recall why I love his music.	2002-02-01

The Promoter Who Brought the Beatles to America	Books	5	3	3	N	N	The Real Deal	Sid Bernstein is nobody who would be called shy.  His bold and confident approach to the music industry made him one of the most successful and historical legends among characters whose sheer presence could eclispe even superstars.  Naturally, the book reads like Bernstein's personality:  it's straightforward, New York-brassy, and honest.  His personal, behind-the-scene accounts of the English invasion and its two major acts -- The Beatles and The Rolling Stones -- are worth the price of the book alone.  But there's more to be learned about the evolution of the music biz from first-person advice than almost anywhere else.  Best of all, it's a very quick read.	2002-02-01

But Melissa Etheridge has bridged the distance like few before her.  What's more, she's chosen the most difficult path possible: autobiography.  She doesn't pull punches about herself or anyone around her.  Everyone gets the same brutally honest treatment she uses to portary her own flaws, weaknesses and insecurities.  What emerges is the self-portrait that can't be done in three-minute songs.  ME's a big star, perhaps the best-ever female in rock; and her fans deserve to know her inspiration, motives and background.  Outstanding job, Melissa.	2001-07-24

Any writer wishing to chronical the race must also be prepared for a intimidating  test of endurance and skill.  On both points, this book captures the spirit and adventure of the disaster that was the '98 edition of one of sailing's most important annual events.  I couldn't stop reading once I started, particularly enjoying the cadence and tone which coincide so precisely with the story's action.  I think this is one of the best books about the sea ever written, from the dual perspectives of the language used as well as the character analysis obtained via detailed research.	2001-07-02

Such is the case here.  Each and every story moves with the natural flow of its characters.  The irony is that the book's central themes of isolation, dispair, lost hopes and impossible dreams somehow fill you completely up.  While I found the stories very easy to read, it's also true a lot of time was spent processing what had so effortlessly jumped off every page.  It's been said that great literature is equipment for living, thus by that measure I'm comfortable standing behind my assessment.  In the years ahead, don't be surprised when you regularly notice these writers' names featured on the best-seller lists.  The authors could become the new crown jewels of UK literature.	2001-03-19

The momentum of the period also touches on The Bealtes and all the other acts and managers who predated and followed these twin giants of rock 'n' roll.  In a word, honesty is what you come away with here.  Yes, there are many great tales from the inside about the stars who are today household names.  Yes, there is no pulling punches when talking about personalities and/or abuses.  And, true to form, there is no shortage of ALO ego when claiming credit for his many contributions.  I'm left with as many questions as answers, but along the way ALO does offer a lot of solutions, which is far more than most rock biographies can claim.  It's quite an easy and enjoyable read if you're interested in the subject, scholarly but also cinematic.	2001-02-21

Sometimes the words fly so fast they take away your breath; in other parts, every syllable inflicts white-hot pain in your soul.  A floating, oral history biography isn't a new literary device, but it's certain the most excellent approach for someone so multidimensional as Bloomfield. Even the most hardcore fan will discover dozens of new stories in this book.  To the newly initiated, the book explains a vital period of blues history.  I surrendered to the book's spell, which is every bit as delicious and intricate as a prolonged Bloomfield solo on a good Saturday night.  The bonus rarities CD is worth the price of admission alone, so how can you miss on this purchase?	2001-02-09

This book widely explores Mr. Vincent's youth,  establishing step-by-step how his Norfolk, Virginia roots helped mold  &quot;The Sound&quot; he started in music.  Before Mr. Vincent, popular  music aimed to hit listeners between the ears or between the arms.  &quot;Be-Bop-A-Lula&quot; clobbered listeners between their legs, and rock  'n' roll would never be the same.  The author's obviously deep love and  respect for Mr. Vincent and his music translates to an extremely intricate  -- albeit highly readable -- study, I would say the best ever written on  the subject.  To her credit, Ms. VanHecke never lets her admiration  overshadow reality.  Mr. Vincent was no candidate for sainthood, either by  destiny or by his own choice.  And it's precisely this aspect of Mr.  Vincent's personality that's so wonderful about the book.  While it's quite  easy to track the direct musical lineage created by Mr. Vincent, millions  of rock music fans probably never recognized that the rebel personna also  started with him.  This book is a must-read for anyone who remotely  appreciates rock 'n' roll.	2000-08-04

While the author's writing style is less than perfect, what strikes  me more is the book's perfect cadence. The narrative moves in precise  relationship to the race's action: sometimes furious, and others almost  dead calm.<br />I've purchased four copies for associates who loved The  Perfect Storm, and all have said they found this book better.  Now, if  Lundy can just get a movie deal. . .	2000-07-10

It's difficult for me to determine if my passion for L.A. overides my ability to be objective about it.  The info has been mostly done before in other books, but none have been any better laid out nor more complete.<br />This book's major value to me  is the validation of why L.A. -- and especially her live performances --  continues to intrigue and challenge me after all this time.  Few artists in  any medium have matured so completely yet unpredictably. This book  catalogues her sustained growth while never falling into the biography trap  of idoltry.<br />Unfortunately, since L.A. tours so infrequently it's  difficult to study her creativity at close range.  We're forced to make  broad artistic assumptions about L.A. on very limited exposure.<br />Since  what I want is more L.A., this book helps keep the flames buring inside my  soul.	2000-04-25

In pure realism we take a walk on the wild side with New York  City's addicts, whores, scam-artists, thieves, beggers and every other form  of gutter life.<br />A broad perspective such as this -- in the hands of  lesser poets -- would seem a tragic commentary, but Reed manages to infuse  just enough human spirit and optimism to keep his scenes above total  chaos.<br />The losers greatly outnumber the winners in Reed's world, if you  keep score.  But most of Reed's characters suffer life's misfortunes from  imposed, not self-inflicted, situations.  The noble &quot;Pass Through  Fire,&quot; even in the face of certain disaster.<br />Lou Reed's book of  lyrics is indispensible. I call it equipment for living.<br />Get a copy  today!	2000-02-02
