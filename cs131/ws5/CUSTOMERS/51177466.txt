I have to say that this book would have made a great TV script. Why didn't the producers have a Titan TV movie or series?  Riker is a great character and with Martin and Mangels as the writers he's finally get his due.  Without spoiling the ending I do have to say that this is one of the better Treks out there. If only they were more frequently published.<br /><br />The only disadvantage to Trek not being on the air is the time lag for the books.  If this were being published during the TV show parts one and two would only be a month apart. Perhaps more giant novels or three part series are the answer.  I think the days of the 9 part \\"A Time To\\" series are long gone.....	2005-10-01

Only in this one the characters are more interesting then the ones in recent live TV trek.  Why wasn't this the subject of a new TV series.  It doesn't go on about the original series Kirk,Spock and McCoy. It has to do with the star ships stationed there and the task of keeping a starbase going.  Unlike DS9, which took place with non federation worlds, this one has starfleet ships and starfleet officers in each direction. I'd like to see more of these because we need them.  If TV Trek isn't coming back in 3 to 5 years, at least we can read about them in the Pocket books universe of Star Trek books...	2005-07-29

I only wish that he was allowed to develop his own version of the Silver Surfer without Stan's influence.  With the alternate \\"What If\\" universe books of the seventies what could go wrong?  This volume gives you more of the Inhumans,Galactus and Silver Surfer.  I'm not going to repeat what the other reviewers have said. The only advice I can give is if you love Kirby's art; purchase the first five volumes of the FF Essencials. After Kirby leaves this book, it's never the same again.	2005-07-12

Not true of this collection!  Not only could they not capture the true spirit of Howard's writing but they should have been left as so...unfinished. This volume leaves the stories as they should be.  I was glad to see the type written unfinished story at the end of the book.<br /><br />I have to wonder why Bran Mac Morn never shared the popularity of Conan. Perhaps it was the poetry that turned off some readers.  It was an unexpected departure from the Conan character we all know. We can only speculate as to what Howard might have created had he lived past age 30.  Not only does Howard transend the art of pulp fiction, he should be up there with Tolkien as one of the great fantasy creators of all time.	2005-07-04

If the Defenders kept their original line up of the Sub-Mariner, Doctor Strange, Hulk and Silver Surfer..those were the best issues.  I have to say after the line up changed the series went straight into the surreal realm of fantasy.  I thought the first stories were the best and this volume proves my opinion is true.<br /><br />You get four characters which are normally known as loners and leaders in their own series. Put them together and you have a lot of interesting personality conflicts.  It's too bad Subby left the group in the early issues.  The Subby, Doctor Strange, and Hulk team could have kept the book strong throughout the seventies.<br /><br />Instead we got Nighthawk and a host of second stringers that were written with fantastic plots instead of good character interaction.<br /><br />This first volume represents the best of the series. I wish that Roy Thomas and Steve Englehart were still writing for Marvel today.  The same is true of the late Ross Andru and Bill Everett; who created the Sub Mariner.  Their work still holds up today as it did all those years ago. This volume brings back a lot of memories for me.	2005-05-26

In it are classics by Harlan Ellison and Roy Thomas.  It's so hard to believe that both Ellison and Roy Thomas are no longer writing for Marvel anymore. It doesn't seem like all that time has passed.  If you love good seventies comics, then this volume of the Hulk is one of the best. I wish artist Herb Trimpe were still drawing the book today. It was a mistake to take him off the book.  I still wish that editor in chief Joey Q at Marvel would let him draw a book in tribute to the seventies version of the Hulk.	2005-05-26

I don't see anywhere on the Trek book schedule parts II and III!  Do we have to wait till next year to finish this series?<br /><br />What I do love about it is it doesn't focus on Kirk, Spock and McCoy. We get to see the other crew members in action. They might not survive at the end of the novel and that is what makes it so interesting.<br /><br />As a fan of Trek I know that our favorites will always win. In these novels there's a bit more suspense because you don't know what will happen next.	2005-04-01

That was one of Luke Cage's most famous lines...This is pure magic classic Marvel Comics of the seventies.  I was hoping this series would go on without Iron Fist. I did like the Power Man Iron Fist team ups; however Luke Cage was better when he worked alone. This character would make an extrodinary TV series because he wouldn't require a super hero costume or super villians to make it contemporary.  I only wish he caught on like Wolverine and Iron Fist did.  This is one comic I wish was still being published as a monthly magazine!	2005-03-21

Not only does the book take you beyond the events in Nemesis; but they transend them with better writing. The Riker character is written much better than that of the movies or the series. He's not turning down this command! I always wanted to see Star Trek: NG with the actor Jonathan Frakes in command. Unlike Paramount Pictures way of thinking; Frakes would have made a wonderful lead in the series.

Spock is implanted with a defective micro chip that has the personality of a madman.  It plays like a 1970's version  the show.  It's one of those novels that would have been a script for the show if it stayed on in the 70's.  If you are a Spock fan. Or even a fan of the original show; it's not the dog everyone says it is.  It will entertain you for a few hours and isn't a total waste of time.	2005-01-24

I was hooked on this novel when I read the first chapter in the review section.  It shows us what happened to Khan and his followers after landing on the planet he was exiled.  I was going to wait for the paperback; however after seeing the cover on this one it was too hard to pass up.  I wish there were more Star Trek books like this one.  The novel should have been released with the movie; Wrath of Khan in 1982.  If only there were more exceptional gems like this one.  It shows the endurance of this legendary film. Only in Star Trek can a film well over twenty years old generate enough interest to make a superior three part series.<br /><br />I have to say at first I was dissapointed in the pacing of Greg's first triology in the Q series; he completed a few years back.  The Khan set of books, and this one is supposedly the last, is paced very well and keeps you reading until the end.<br /><br />Khan is a tragic character in the Shakespere tradition. Under the right set of circumstances he might have been a great leader. His arrogance and pride got in the way and makes him a classic tragic figure.	2005-01-14

It crosses over both the DC and Marvel universe without taking 12 issues.

It tends to be very broad and sweeping with the action/ adventure themes...What I do like about this is that Kirk is a part of the current Star Trek time line with Picard and company.<br /><br />If you read this one without reading the first you won't be too lost.  Nothing much happened in the first novel.  I can see that the first one could have been told in three or four chapters.  You have to credit Judith and Garfield Reeves Stevens for putting out a good story from Shatner's notes. His name is on the book.

This one has a lot more Kirby concepts and the story gets rolling along a lot faster. We get to see Dracula...in this case Dragorin as an adversary against Superman.  The Shield and the Newsboy Legion from Kirby's earlier works make another appearece here.  I have to admit Kirby is an aquired taste.<br /><br />When I was a youngster in 1970 I thought anyone could draw in the style of Kirby.  It wasn't until I started creating my own art that I understood what he was trying say.  It isn't the perfect anatomy that tells the story ..but the cartoony figures that are so dynamically portrayed, that do.<br /><br />I wish that DC would follow Marvel's lead and put all of Kirby's greatest works on CD ROM.

Don Heck, the artist of Iron Man gave the series a lot of class. While unfairly given bad reviews by the fan press Don was a drama and romance comics artist first.

To me it was like the Fantastic Four with more super powered problems.  We get to see the personal glimses of their lives when they were not super beings. Cap had to deal with what it was like to be out of touch with the world while he was frozen.  Iron Man had a bad heart because of the shrapnel he got back in the war.<br /><br />While I don't like the black and white format it is the most affordable format.

The only fault in this book is that it should have been longer and had more art reproductions of the covers.  I loved every page of this.  I can see some of the ships slightly resemble the U.S.S.

We get to see what he might have done if he were the artist behind one of Marvel's great villians.  It features an unlikely team of two of Marvel's most misunderstood characters.  Sub Mariner; who played villian and hero on and off depending on the writer, and Doom who was such an interesting personality. Both of them have to ironically fight nemesis like the Red Skull who want to conquer and overthrow their territory.<br /><br />This title never became what the hero inspired Marvel Team Up with Spider-Man became.  It would have survived if Doom had teamed up with other villians than the ones in this volume.  Perhaps a team up with Doc Ock from Spidey might have helped?<br /><br />With all the old Marvels of the sixties and Seventies making a re-appearance this one is a must buy.

In the future people can have a chip implanted to record everything that's experienced from cradle to grave.  The William's character has to edit the film to make monsterous people look like saint.  His current job has a personal connection to his past and possible future that is very disturbing.	2004-08-14

A look that you don't see very often on any Peanuts cover...an angry Charlie Brown.  I loved to see the early years of the strip I never got to see as a child. The Sunday strips should be in color and I would pay that extra to see them! That would be my advice to the publishers.  I am going to follow this one for the next 12 years because I love Peanuts.  It was one of my first comic strips I read as a child and I still love to read the old ones to this day. I was hoping that someone would make the complete strips available.  I never thought that the publishers of the Comics Journal would be the ones to do so. Who think that a few years ago that Fantagraphic Books could take on a project of this magnatude?	2004-05-12

The Children of Hamlin is just as the title describes. It's about the decedents of a massacre where the children were thought to be taken away or slaughtered by ruthless aliens that outmatched the Federation.<br />Fifty years after the dreaded event, it turns out many of the children thought to be long dead are alive among a people called the \\"Choraii.\\"  Picard negotiates with these ruthless aliens to get Hamlin survivors and decedents back home ... only some of them developed a life there and don't want to go back.<br />It could have been a proposed script for the TV show and it has of all cast members Tasha Yar as head of security. This is classic season one material. The characters have a lot of unknowns that were later filled in by later episodes. In this novel the characters seem so a little fresher and more impulsive. In one scene Picard loses his temper with the a negotiator. He starts banging his fist his desk and demanding a straight answer from him.	2004-04-20

The black and white don't do these stories justice; although they are still enjoyable.  If you like the seventies greats as far as writers are concerned...ones like Roy Thomas, Gerry Conway, Wolverine creator Len Wein..then this is the book for you. It has the first twenty five titantic issues all in one volume.  Growing up in the seventies I do remember getting that first issue in a coffee shop/newsstand way back in 1972.  This is when comics were 20 cents each! Artists like Gil Kane, Ross Andru (who drew the Spider-Man/Superman team up), Ghost Rider's Don Perlin,Sal Buscema, Mike Esposito all took part in this great comic all those years ago. I will never forget those Gil Kane covers. This volume also has the first Spidey team up with Brother Vodoo!  For those of you who love seventies Marvel, don't let this one pass you by!	2004-04-17

Wesley was instumental in helping the mission.<br />In this finely crafted tale by John Vornholt, Wesley has to decide to stay as a traveler or return to his human roots....the ending will surprise you.<br />All I can say is if it were made into a movie it would have been better than &quot;Nemesis&quot;...because it touches on humanity and the need for all of us to be wanted and part of a family.	2004-03-10

DeCandido has everything for Klingon fans in this two book saga.  Aboard the I.K.S. Gorkon, Captain Klag, from the Next Generation episode \\"A Matter of Honor,\\" commands the ship.  The Klingon Defense Force ship is a Chancellor Class out to explore space just as the Enterprise.  Only this adventure embodies more of the Klingon value system; which is more entertaining than Federation based stories.  The characters have just as much honor and will to do \\"the right thing,\\" just as the Starfleet officers do.<br />It's great to see Federation politics from a different perspective.  The San-Tarah world rivals that of the Klingons.  Klag and his men have to challenge them in several contests that pit their fighting skills. If the Klingons are defeated they can never return.  However if they win; the consequences will have political ramifications that will influence the Empire forever.<br />Another great addition to this novel is the glossary of Klingon terms.  It's an overview of terms used in Klingon episodes from all the Star Trek TV shows. It looks like this is an ongoing series that we can look forward to for the next few years.	2003-10-25

He believes Bashir's genetically enhanced intelligence could create a new race of Khans to rule the Federation.  David Weddle leaves no stone unturned in this novel that might easily be a two part DS9 movie.  It's great to see the former DS9 story editor write a novel about the show.

Any fan of the Q books by Peter David will like this one.  While it's written by another fan favorite; Greg Cox, I have to say I did enjoy the verbal arguments that both Picard and Q were in. Greg handles them quite well.  I never got to see Greg at a convention; however after seeing an interview on one of the Star Trek DVD's, he impressed me.  I liked him because he's a true Star Trek fan. He's not pretentious or arrogant like some authors are. If you read this book you won't be disappointed.

For those of you who love comic book illustration this one shows you forced perspective and how to draw the human form for comics. It's a medium that gets no respect.  Yet it requires it's illustrators to be very dynamic and inventive to keep a readers attention. This one shows you how dramatically light your characters and backgrounds. The amount of technical skill that is needed to draw a comic is more than good looking pinups. I hope there are more books from these authors. It's a step in the right direction with the flood of how to draw books. This one tells you something about making good comics.	2003-10-04

Klaus Janson shows you how to have a light source, use forced perspective to show drama and lots of technical tricks of the trade I never thought of. This takes his first book about comic book penciling to next level. It shows how comic pros like Neal Adams handle a problem vs. another with a different approach to the same drawing. I have read this from cover to cover and enjoy reading how Klaus faces the empty page with creative solutions to drawing problems.<br />I have admired his work since the 1970's to the present. While  his blotchy and cartoony inking style is a far cry from his detailed work in the seventies, I still enjoy work.	2003-09-20

I am very happy that the series was reprinted in color.  The current black and white reprints don't do the stories justice.

Sulu has a few tricks of his own to solve problems and his command style is much different than Kirk's.  I hope to see more of this crew.

Sure, a lot of reviewers said that it just gives out the plots of each episode. Voyager had lots of problems behind the scenes and I don't think that Berman and Braga and the people at Paramount wanted any of that information released to the public.<br />I know that you could write ten books about this size with the unhappy behind the scenes material.  Robert Beltran was right when he said in a lot of episodes the &quot;shields were going down&quot; and some alien was invading the ship each week.<br />Kate Milgrew said how the producers were more &quot;concerned with her hair style&quot; than the stories.<br />The Pocket books Star Trek: Voyager series had far better stories than the material that went to air each week on TV.<br />I do have to add there are nice photographs for the episodes.  The story descriptions help you understand the illogic of this show which I call Voyager: Lost in Space.  Seven of Nine is the Robot.  The holographic Doctor could be Dr. Smith.  Harry Kim might be the Will Robinson of the show.	2003-06-21

I hope there are many more Klingon books by Hertzler and Lang! The raw power and emotion comes off the page. The passion the Klingons have in their personality comes off the page. It's one of those stories you just can't put down! It makes me wonder why the producers of Star Trek don't bring back this series to television.

From what the author said in one of the reviews; his publisher altered his original concept and manuscript. My solution would be to repackage and update it.  Shatty's  Priceline troubles will hurt him again because there are still complaints in the news about that company.  I have to say after reading Shatnerica I have a very different view of Captain Kirk.  He may have had some talent but his arrogance is all that's left. He might have been a great actor if he acted like a human being and not the &quot;leading man&quot; he never was. Except on Star Trek that is. How many of the cast would want to work with him again?<br />I'd still have to say the author still accomplished his goal.

All the characters are on target.  I like the storyline with Gul Mucet (Dukat's Brother) and his new status as an ex Cardassian keeper of the empire.  No longer is Cardassia terrorizing the people of Bajor.  This series is exactly what Star Trek needs. A continual story arc with interesting characters.  Col. Kira has her hands full with all the new people on board. You have to ask yourself is the Federation on the side of the Bajorians?  Kira is being pulled by her loyalty to Bajor and her duties as Col. of the station.  She's not Starfleet.  This is what makes the dynamic of the story so interesting.  Ro is now security chief and has many of Kira's traits.  It will be interesting to see where they take this series of books.  Lets hope that the editor has a lot of plot twists just like the TV series.	2002-09-17

With Odo back on his homeworld someone has to fill his shoes.  This officer has had a long and varied career in the fleet.  Col. Kira is now in charge of the station.  We get to see Nog as a Lt. on the Defiant. The place has changed a bit.  Quark is still fixing his Dabo tables.<br />All in all it's a story that takes place after the Dominion War but it's still a good series. If you are a fan go out and buy this one.	2002-08-30

It's about a ninja who's gets his arms and legs removed in battle. His limbs are bionically replaced.  The cartooning is excellent and reads just like a storyboard for a movie.  There are a lot of scenes with no dialogue. The Will Eisner influence is there with the heavy shadows fast action. I wish Miller's art didn't take such a decline in recent years. I would bring back Klaus Janson for inking on any of his future projects.	2002-08-16

This is the classic Avengers/Defenders book that you can't put down!  The classic 70's writers and artists are all here.  Steve Englehart, writer and Bob Brown and Sal Buscema as artists.  It's about Loki, the Avengers first adversary and how he teams up with Dr. Strange's nemesis, Dormammu!  It's an all out slug festival to the finish with Marvel's finest talent.  I wish they made them like this again.  All the artists today get their contract and are in and out like yesterday's news.  Bob Brown was one of Marvels most under rated artists.  He also did the art chores on Daredevil.  Sal Buscema was a workhorse and provided a lot of classic material that still stands up today.  Writer Steve Englehart was another one of those names you never heard a lot about..however they were the mainstay at Marvel in the 70's ...	2002-08-08

It shows an untested captain and makes for much more interesting stories.. there is a scene in this novel where the characters are surrounded by intergalactic wolves.  Greyhorse is another one of those Friedman characters that always surprise the reader.<br />This series is going to rival that of Peter David's Excalibur series.  I just wish they would do more than two a year.  At that pace no one is going to get into this series without having to wait a very long time for the next installment.	2002-07-18

With tornados in outer space and all types of unusual phenomena Picard tumbles and falls on his own mistakes in this one. What a great TV series this would make.

I wouldn't be surprised if the movie is based on the material written in this paperback.  If you like Daredevil and the best Miller art ....in my opinion no one has ever surpassed his work on this title...buy this one.  It's before Sin City and his run on the Dark Knight.

This one is about a guy in at least his fifties as the hero of the story.  That is what appealed to me so much here.  The story is told from the viewpoint about a guy who isn't super human.

One of them had a zombie slowly deteriorating and was pointless. It was one of those stories that must have paid the bills for the writer. Other than that it there were half good and half bad. It was still worth the price of the book.  The better tales like the one where the soldiers are wondering about their final days on earth were more realistic than usual.	2002-06-29

While not a keeper it's better than the one called Dyson's Sphere.  Diane Duane always writes a solid story and this one is one of them.	2002-06-29

I think this new set of prequels have the readers of modern sci fi in mind. Nothing will be able to top the originals...how could they?  They have a history all of their own.  The new Dune books should be seen with a new point of view. They certainly won't satisfy all the fans who say they are not like the original.  However I believe they will add a new perspective to the saga that Brian can call his own. I give it five stars.	2002-06-25

Imagine all of the great stories we will never see because Ellison won't publish this 3 volume anthology. I hope that I am proven wrong.

Even if Perez's work remained the way it was back then I still feel that he is one of the best artists in the comic industry.  This one has everything. Battles with the ultimate villian, Ultron are one of the best I have seen.  I am what you call an older comics fan. I still have a sense of wonder that I once had. Spectacular battle scenes only done justice by George Perez. I rememer once how John Byrne once ridiculed Perez's art as simplistic...he can eat his words now. Perez's style has grown to surpass Byrne's by light years. While Byrne's art remains stagnant Perez is always evolving and growing into a much better artist than a lot of the current crop at Marvel.	2002-06-07

It was like reading the story boards for the next X-Men feature film.<br />Too bad Morrison and Quitely won't have a long term run on this title. Remember Curt Swan's art on Superman and how long he stayed with the title? X-Men needs these guys on the title for at least five years to revive them to new heights again.<br />It's like the old magic with Lee and Jack Kirby have returned again! I should add that Clearmont and Byrne revived the title again in the late seventies...and don't forget artist Dave Cockrum......although Morrison and Quitely have a style all their own; they have been reborn with a new vision of substance and ol' Marvel Magic.	2001-12-07

I was very surprised and wrong about my assesment by the back cover. In this one any creativity or wrong thinking is fatal.  A lost starship crashes on this planet only for it's captain to survive.  His mind was wiped of any reference to Starfleet and his former life. While I know the major characters would not meet their demise....it's was very exciting to see how Picard escaped the mind wipe intact.  The scenes with the all knowing &quot;one eye&quot; cameras/assault units were the best.

A group of Borg like aliens board the station for an artifact Quark purchased.  I know the book series won't finish major characters.  However, it goes on my list as the best of the early book series.	2001-08-04

It has one big difference.  This exciting story by Dean Wesley Smith and Kristine Kathryn Rusch has Kirk transporting hundreds of people from a dying civilization.  The scenes that make this one stand out?  The ones where he struggles with the Prime Directive and his classmate and friend, Captain Bogle.  The Klingons join in this rescue with great reluctance.  It's not another shoot from the hip Jim Kirk here.  I have always said he's not the space cowboy that the next generation always claimed he was.  Just as Picard has finesse in negotiation; Jim also has the ability to seek out a peaceful resolution without firing a phaser.	2001-07-25

It's a CIA like branch that obeys no laws and will use any means to protect the Federation. The question as to how or why Jim Kirk's friend was murdered is never truly answered. Poor guy was in a transporter accident!  However, it makes for good reading.  My only wish was that this author could have written all four books. All the characters are true to their tv roots. This series should have been one large giant novel.  You never see Stephen King having a story in four novels.  Star Trek should do the same.  Less books. Better editing makes for a better story.	2001-06-28

This was done in the first season with Troi and the beginning of the second season with the Okona character helping Picard with the two warring families.  In this one Troi's Mom, Lwaxana falls for Q!  She even acquires powers of our favorite from the Q continuum.  She does not fear his ability to wipe out anyone in an instant.  Of all of the novels this is one that should have been produced as an episode.  The dialogue rings true to all the characters.<br />In this one we even get a surprise visit from Q two.  Portrayed by Corben Bernsen from LA Law.  The surprise in this novel is that no one acts contrary to the way we see them on TV.  In too many of the novels the dialogue doesn't cut it.  This reads like an episode from beginning to end.	2001-06-24

It tells the first story of the Enterprise before it acquired it's legendary name.  Under the captaincy of Robert April; George Kirk (Jim's father) embarks on the test run of the infamous ship.  The adversary in this one is the Romulans.  We get a glimpse of their uncompromising world of political treachery within their own ranks.  This one is everything the new prequel series should be.  Alive with interesting characters that act like real humans; unlike some of the Starfleet members we've seen on TV in the show Voyager.  If there is any book that needs a reprinting it's this one.	2001-05-13

It's like season eight has begun with this new launch of the DS9 book series.  Col. Kira has never been portrayed better than in this novel.  There are the old familiar characters with lots of new ones to follow.  It's a rare treat to read a novel that is very much like it's TV counterpart.  I hope S.D.Perry continues to write this extrodinary series.  Perry should have monthly or bi-monthly installments of this series to write. Of all the series; DS9 deserves a writer as good as this!	2001-05-02

No boring questions about the amount of pips on Data's collar.  To test your true knowledge of all the Trek series; the writer utilizes resonable material from good episodes.  There are no obscure references. I found it entertaining and insightful on the details I didn't notice at first.	2001-04-06

It takes his classic New Gods and deprives the reader of the colorful atmosphere and mood that made the series so special.  Did DC think that new readers would purchase this in black and white?  That color would be too expensive?  I cannot imagine why the suits at DC decided to publish Kirby's work in this format. Wait for the color version!	2001-03-26

Spock and Picard work together to discover the secret behind the &quot;dead zones&quot; that are crippling starships.  Instead of the old Kirk and Spock routine that's been done endlessly; we get a logical Picard effectively working with our favorite Vulcan.<br />T'sart, the former Romulan war criminal, has the information to stop the chaos.  This novel portrays the Spock character much better than the televised &quot;Unification&quot; episodes.  He actually knows the functions and operations of this version of the Enterprise.  This one can endure repeated readings because it is so dramatic.  I give it a very enthusiastic 5 stars	2001-03-01

As ambassador to the federation; Worf has to negotiate a delicate peace between the white wolf aliens on the cover and the Klingons that conquered them long ago.  We get to see Klag; the first officer that Riker encountered on the Klingon officer exchange episode in Next Generation.  Klag is captain of his own ship and doesn't see eye to eye with Worf. Lots of the Klingons in the Deep Space Nine episodes make appearances here. The book has dialogue that is true to the characters.  This would have made a terrific two part episode.  Rodeck; Worf's brain altered brother is a crew member on Klag's ship.  He appears to be pretty much an officer who does not have the spark of his former life as Kurn. It's too bad his brother had to be changed.<br />This one is the best Klingon novel to date.  I can't wait for the one by the actor that plays General Martok!	2001-02-11

For those of you that love the classic series; this set of books are the written word version of each episode.  Why read the written versions?  Well, James Blish provides lots of insight as to what is going through the minds of Kirk, Spock and McCoy along with the orginal crew.  In the episode the Alterative Factor James Blish provides a better ending than the questionable one on TV.  The novels provide a lot more facts on the crew and background details never metioned in the series.	2001-01-22

Especially the Wolverine Batman combination in this volume!  This is where the comic companies should be expending their efforts.  It's experimental mini-series titles like this that make the genre interesting again.  Another I loved was Dave Gibbons Captain America/Superman hero the Super-Soldier.

The death of Gary was a crushing blow to Kirk.  We get to see what happened before they become officers.  It's so unusual to hear Kirk having to answer to a captain!  Gary turns out to be the one who influenced Kirk's life profoundly.  It's his experience living in the large city as opposed to Kirk's confined upbringing as a kid. His friend helped him take risks at the right time to further his career and love life.  That's why Kirk felt such a loss.	2001-01-14

It has a picture of what looks like a station crew member in a very similar uniform.  For those of you who love space battles; this one's for you! It's about a fellow who is pushed into a war before he is ready.  Untried and untested he fights a war that truly is hell. This one was written without the mindset of most series books.  The protagonist and hero of the story: Scott St. Andrew,is portrayed as a true and realistic personality.  Not some heroic soldier out for glory.This one will probably be a series; however it's not set to sell millions of action figures like another franchise.	2001-01-07

It certainly reads like a teleplay.  All the characters are consistant with what we've seen on the screen. David has taken what would have been a dull and dry subject...Vir battling his former alien influenced boss Lando; into a tragic tale.  Without spoiling it for the reader, I'll say this....Vir does makes a lot of choices that harden him. He's transformed into the leader of Centauri Prime. With lots of help from Sheridan and an unexpected Techno-Mage.	2001-01-05

This calender was not designed for the fan who likes large photos of the crew.  I would have preferred a background to the photos; which are smaller than ever. The Voyager calender incorporated a designer background to each monthly photo.  Too much white space; is the first comment I'd have about this edition.  Too plain and ordinary.

I love the neon frame around each photo; however it would be nice to see some photos of Worf battling an enemy or Picard in an action scene.  Even black and white photos near the daily calender content. The first Trek calenders had smaller pics by the grid. It was in one of the first classic calenders in 1976.  I wish they'd liven it up a little with some smaller photos off to the side of the mothly head shot or in the calender writing area.	2001-01-02

This one has all the action of the &quot;Crossover&quot; episode of the series. I just wish it could have been condensed into one book.  This series warranted one &quot;Giant Novel&quot; like the DS9 &quot;Millennium&quot; series. This series offers &quot;Mirror&quot; versions Seven, Dr. Crusher, Janeway,and Troi.	2001-01-01

The best part of this one is Ant Man's journey through the Vision to repair him.  The rest of the saga has the art of John and Sal Buscema. Both are no Neal Adams. However their contribution to the story is very well done; even by today's standards.  New Marvel fans should pick this up. It stands the test of time.  A true classic in the ranks of Marveldom!

This book gives you each of the Superman covers.  The second twenty five years are a little more polished and better than the first twenty five.  The artistic simplicty and style of the times are apparent in this volume.  A more innocent time; where comics did not attempt to recreate Frank Miller's &quot;Dark Knight&quot; with each passing month. The &quot;Death of Superman&quot; story did little more than make the character into a darker version.  I'm glad the &quot;All American&quot; Superman is back though.

With all his lighting and film noir techniques; Matt Murdock became a real character with flaws that made him all too human.  I especially like the Bullseye villian.  He is like what the Green Goblin was to Spidey.  The Kingpin took over that role with his turn at Murdock. He destroyed his legal practice.  However that's another story.....	2000-12-30

It was good to see a vision of Star Trek that had action and aliens that were not all too trustworthy.  More than any of the others; this series embodied all the values of Trek.
