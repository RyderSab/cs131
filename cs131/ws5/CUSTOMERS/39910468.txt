This is one of the best prison books alongside &quot;Papillion,&quot;  &quot;Death and the Maiden,&quot; and &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman.&quot;<br />It's purpose is to juxtapose foolish freedom with insane ancient cultures. The result is tragic, terrifying, and almost beyond comprehension in it's cruelty. Turkey has been infamous for it's torture techinques for CENTURIES! And if you don't believe  prison life in Muslim countries isn't still like this, you must be crazy! (Read &quot;Not Without My Daughter;&quot; the film doesn't even begin to touch on the horrors Betty Mahmoody survived in Iran). As another (very disturbed) reviewer points out here, William Hoffer is<br />the co-author of both books, NOT because he is a &quot;one sided, racist&quot; but because that's the genre he's an expert in! AND, HE IS NOT TELLING THE STORIES, BILLY AND BETTY ARE!!!<br />One REALLY cool note: you can see the REAL Billy Hayes acting in a play about prison life filmed at the Odessey Theatre in Los Angeles in 1988!  It's called, &quot;The Cage&quot; and  it's only available on half(dot)com.

A wonderful companion book to &quot;The Complete Poems of John Keats &quot; is the photo-essay collection, &quot;Walking North With Keats,&quot; which recreates a 44-day walking tour that the poet made with his writer-friend Charles Brown in 1818 through northern England, Ireland, and Scotland---which unfortunately was THE walk where he fell ill with the tuberculosis that would finally kill him at 25!<br />The author extensively, but joyfully, highlights Keats's early life, reviews the period's travel literature, photographs the locations &amp; introduces Keats' odes &amp; ballads as well as his letters written during the journey (which helps put into context the poems presented in this book)!	2004-02-19

Their account of Stanley's trek, and their own, is exhausting, treacherous, and even hilarious in chapters like &quot;Tenative Steps,&quot; &quot;Deviation and Disaster,&quot; and &quot;Mountains of the Moon.&quot;<br />Though less lyrical than Synge, it was enlightening to get detailed descriptions of the Rwenzori Range set 50 years apart!	2004-02-18

With descriptions of Reeves and his environs and his creepy circle of friends, you can practically smell the vodka on his guests' breath, the decay of his ripped worsted-wool Superman suit, the gardenia perfume of his evil girlfriend wafting in his bedroom after his bullet-riddled body has been removed!

It is a great companion book to any practical travel guides you might take along with you when visiting Costa Rica.<br />The title, Costa Rica: The Last Country The Gods Made\\" refers to the fact that it is one of the youngest geological formations in the world. That's just one of the far-out facts the authors serve up. And did you know that Costa Rican grade schools teach classes on animal & environmental protection issues? Or that Costa Rica was the first banana-exporting country in Central America?<br />The photos match the spirit of the text in that they mix expected subjects (coffee plantations, rainforests) and random moments (a crazed street-preacher, a graveyard under an approaching storm).....A lovely book to own on all accounts.	2002-03-31
