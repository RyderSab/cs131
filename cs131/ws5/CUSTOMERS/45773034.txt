Take a deep breath and take a good hard look at yourself.  It may or may not be pretty, but one thing is sure, it would probably be confusing.  This book is about us; as humans and how we interact with others.  it is genius.  Pure and simple.  well, no - more than that, exceptionally well written.  Almot poetry.  Anyone who reads this will get something out of it, and it will touch your soul.  It will strike you deep down inside where you need to be shaken and forced to see the realities that none of us want to look at.  I especially liked the chapter in \\"rejecting the Slavery of Security\\". <br /> <br />This is a must read.  This is a must have.  This is what we all should read and understand before we enter adulthood.	2005-10-08

I found this necessary, as the truth and the history of our country is so clouded by media and revisionism, that it becomes very important to really look and study why our country was set up like it is.  I recommend it to everyone.  But I especially recommend it to students of law and our country.  It is interesting, and well written.  It easily is equivalent to a number of college level classes in constitutional law.	2005-10-08

I have been travelling to PRC on and off over the last ten years.  I have to tell you that this simple book was able to put all the puzzle pieces in place.  Rarely has such a book been able to do that.  By reading the book I can now understand why the chinese act as they do in certain situations.  I really recommend this book.  This is an absolutely fantastic book.  It tells it as it really is.	2005-09-09

In the old days, that is pre-1970, the best reference books for Engineers came from Marks Handbook or Machinery's Handbook.  For Electrically inclined people they turned to HAM Operator construction books. <br /> <br />Now, in the white collar world of cubicles, and computers, we have digitized versions of the old standbys.  The paper versions of the books are too inclusive and unweildy.  So most Engineers tend to go on line or purchase digital CD versions of the books. <br /> <br />That is well and good for traditional tools used by the skilled professional.  But that is NOT the case for the wide bredth and scope of meeting and analysis tools that have been developed and honed in the last few decades. <br /> <br />But how can one understand the tools, unless one is presented with the knowledge and technology to do so?  Not every company will willingly fly their employees to an expensive 3 day training class.  And even if they did, how would one identify which tool is available for which problem? <br /> <br />This book does this job nicely.  It is a simple guide and resource of techniques used to solve problems.  It runs the list from SWOT Analysis to TBPM Process Mapping, team building, ROI, and development checks.  It is an invaluable resource. <br /> <br />It is all meat.  No fluff here.  It gives you just the information necessary to start and work a analysis.  Then, if you need more information, you can easily cruse the internet. <br /> <br />I recommed this.  I also think that it deserves a place in any Managers office, and certainly a handy guide for any white collar employee.  It is well worth the price!  Compare the cost of this book to any Speciality technical resources.  Typically books on plastics are $100+.  I urge a serious look into this book.  It really is a great guide.	2005-09-09

This book is one of the few books that cover the mysteries of the moon in any real detail.  And the moon does have it's own mysteries, make no mistake.  Why, for example, does the full moon cover the entire orb of the sun within 1% as viewed from earth?  Or why is the moon hollow?  Yes it is a mystery.  Tests have concluded through ground penetration, that if not hollow, it has certainly a difficult to explain interior composition.<br /><br />These reasons alone are worthy of conjecture.  This book certainly fills a serious void and asks questions that are not obvious to answer.<br /><br />Where it fails is in the supporting details.  It could use an update, and it could use a great deal of technical information.  It is not enough to offer conclusions, as the book has, based on the mysteries inherent with the moon.  Rather, each mystery should be identified and described in detail.  Then only at the very end of the book should conclusions and supporting evidence be presented.<br /><br />Aside from this glaring problem, the book is a easy read, if a bit repetitious.  It covers a major mystery and one not easily answered.  It is worthwhile, if only for it's uniqueness.  If found, I would recommend it's purchase.	2005-09-03

In that respect it was good.  That was, however, the only thing that I found worthwhile in the book.  The book wrote about many things that were just out and out wrong. <br /> <br />It offended me.

When I bought the work book, my first thought was that this was just some kind of book '0 forms.  Much like what you would find in a stationary store or at an office supply store.  But I was wrong.  This book is really two books.  The work book is designed to be cut into two different books.  One is a record book that enables you to track your entire job hunting campaign.  The other book, and in my opinion, the most important, enables you to create an absolutely magnificant resume.  If you loved the book, then this work book is an absolute must.   <br /> <br />However, I must caution you that the workbook is, indeed, a lot of work.  And so to really use the book, you must use the workbook.  And to use the workbook, you need to exert effort.  The rewards are great.  This is a dynimite combination.  He is really something else.  I recommend this book very highly.	2005-07-23

If you aspire to be a CEO some day, or are striving towards the top rung of that corporate ladder, this book will help you get there.  You get to see the hiring process for the upper level executives.  And, it is really helpful and beneficial for anyone who has any degree of business experience.

I think that is is a great author, but this book left me cold and bored.  It is his worst book.  Starange as it seems, this is supposed to be his most important book.  Maybe so for certain people...but for me, I found it rather dull.  It was repetative, and dare I say it, pretty unbelieveable.  Unless you think that you have been contacted by aliens from the great beyond, you might find this a rather uninteresting read.  However, if you feel apart, and feel something special about yourself, then perhaps this book can be a key to better understand yourself.  I don't know.  I didn't like it.	2005-06-29

Torture?  The Romans spent all of their leasure time thinking about how to improve it.  Let me tell you, you do not want to of crossed any of the people depicted here.  Words cannot describe the content in this book.  But it is worth while to get and read.  Here is but one of the more noteworthy passages: <br /> <br />\\"...christians were exposed to the mauling of wild beasts of every description, so that the skin and meat was gradually eaten or clawed away from their bones as they clung to the hideous vestiges of life.  Many of these beasts were specially trained to sexually violate and sodomie their prey before dismemberment; female prisoners doused in civet grease were often raped half to death by feral dogs or buggered by baboons beneath the spectator's gae before being duly devoured...\\" <br /> <br />I don't think that anything that I can say can do this book justice.  It is a very powerful and disturbing book.	2005-06-09

After reading book after book trying to figure out the mysteries of UFO's, I have finally found one that puts it all together.  This is so good that it has to be written by an Alien.  No human could of possibly come up with so many unique concepts in such a short span of this book. <br /> <br />I feel that I understand what everything is all about.  It makes sence.  It is clear.  It is presented in such a easy and well written way.  I am not stretching the truth in any way when I state that the writer has to be a genius.

After reading another book on the science of UFO's, I couldn't satisfy my lust for more of this kind of information.  To this end, I did a Amazon search and come up with a number of books.  By the subject and by the apparent content, this seemed to me to be exactly the kind of book that I was waiting for. <br /> <br />But then I read the reviews.  All very poor.  Well, I disregarded the reviews.  I bought the book and took it with me on a long business trip.  I figured that I would be able to finish this book easily on the 13 hour flight from San Francisco to China.  Boy was I wrong. <br /> <br />Do not buy this book.  You are wasting your time. <br /> <br />Here are my impressions.  These are impressions only.  I get the strong impression that this was written by a egocentric graduate student with red suspenders, overweight, with a Michael Moore stubby face.  His pompous opinion of his self is irritating to say the least.  He covers simple concepts with great verbosity and makes it seem so complex.  So much so that he is insulting.  He then takes genuine complex processes and takes on the additude of a know-it-all over simplifying and looking down the nose to an inferior peer. <br /> <br />His research is faulty.  His assumptions, invariabily erronous.  His explainations of certain processes absolutely wrong.  Some of the concepts that he refers to are so out of date, at I wonder whether he actually researched any aspect of his book. <br /> <br />I am angered and insulted after reading this book.  It is nonsense and worthless.  Buying this book is perhaps the worst mistake I have made this century.	2005-05-23

But at other portions of the book were some real diamonds and nuggets of information presented in a way with surprising potential. <br /> <br />This book is wothwhile because it introduced me to the UFO and alien contact expeiences induced by dimethyltryptamine. <br /> <br />You will find discriptions of such things as the \\"Blue Xendra Arch\\" of Alagoas, Brail. <br /> <br />This is a book with potential.

Don't let my three star rating turn you away from this book.  It is well written, complete in every sense of the word and well illustrated.  I gave it three stars because I found other books on this subject to be more readable and easier to use as a guide and reference.

It is useful if you have more than two people working on a hull (one to read aloud and the other to work).  But it is not an easy, cook book on boat building.

This is inspirational and yet beautiful at the same time.  It is a must read for any Eckankar chelas.  I read the book, and each time that I rearead it, I gain a greater insight into myself and the world around me.  I was amazed that the author wrote this book.  It just goes to show you how intertwined our soul matrices are.  As I have stated, it is a MUST READ for anyone interested in ECKANKAR.  It is also an inspirational story for those not involved in the teachings.  If you are interested in religion, spirituality and the development of the self, then you will not be disappointed.  This is a great book to read.	2005-04-08

Brad is one heck of a writer, and I must say that for him to get any less than a four star rating would be a crime.  This was typical Brad.  Well written, easy to read.  Well laid out and thought out.  However, it wasn't as \\"earth-shattering\\" as some of his other works.  Almost a rehash.  But there were some jewels in this book.  And the isolated items make the purchase of the book all the worthwhile.  It is not the best book on UFO abductions, but it does manage to cover some new territory and can be down right impossible to put down.  This is a good book.  Not the best, mind you, but a good read anyways. <br />	2005-04-08

I read it cover to cover, and it revolutionized my thoughts and action plan for getting hired.  It is well written, and packed with lean, mean and to the point advice.  It is written from experience and is a very important work.  Now, today it might be a little dated, but the writing style and the way it is laid out are timeless.  I have read this book over four times, and each time I read it I learn a little bit more.  It is an excellent work, and I would recommend it to anyone who is wiching to change careers or look for a new position.	2005-04-05

It is jam packed with experiments, observations, thoughts and procedures related to the chemistry of mind altering substances.  As I am not a chemist, I glossed over the more technical aspects of the work, but as an Engineer, I was \\"blown Away\\" by the methodology and unique perspective.  In his own way, he is a trail blazer and a real inventor.  A person who like Telsa, Bell, and Howard Huges persued a dream of discovery and exploration.  He used his scientific training to forge ahead where other fear to tread, and he makes light of it in such an off hand way.  THis book is an INSPIRATION to any BUDDING young CHEMIST.  I found myself wishing to take night classes in Chemistry after reading this book.  It is that powerful!	2005-04-05

This was, from my point of view, very boring and slow moving.  It really didn't pick up until one half the way through the book.  Personally, I was hoping for much more \\"hard\\" science and observations, but instead the book is filled with all kinds of \\"New Age\\" wisdom.  I am not being critical of the experiencers, nor am I questioning their validity.  My comments are on the substance of the book and the material presented.  You could, if you wanted to, write the book in a \\"Cliff Note\\" style...  I was asleep.  Aliens woke me up.  They floated me to their craft.  They conducted experiments on me.  They led me back to my bed.  I slept. <br /> <br />What became interesting was when the writer started to make claims to be a translator for a galatic federation.  Um...OK.  But still, even these unique insights were not able to provide me with the meat and potatoes that I needed and desired from this book.  I found the book to be a disapointment and I do not recommend it for researchers searching for definative hard observations.	2005-03-22

Dr. Brown is an ex-NSA Remote Viewer.  He was engaged on a project to study the \\"so called\\" Gray Aliens.  This was conducted over a 2 - 3 year period.  He studied their history, motives, technology and other attributes.  All test sequences were \\"BLIND\\" with only one or two front loaded.  Interesting and very worthwhile.  The only data published was the ones that were verified by other sources. It was easy and a fast read.  Highly enjoyable and thought provoking.  It certainly gives one a unique insight concerning aliens and ufos.  I think this guy is right and this is the best book out there to actually make the issues about ufo's understandable and reasonable.  This is a worthwhile purchase.  I highly recommend it.	2005-02-22

It was interesting, but not as detailed as I would of liked it to be.  It was easy and fun to read.  But it left me hungry for more.  I wish that he would of enclosed more specific stories of some the Remote Viewing sessions than he did, rather than do on about how the politics of the government eventually destroyed the organization.  But it is a great first book on Remote Viewing, and it is also a great additional book to a Remote Viewing collection.  But if you want some adventure and stories about the actual Experiences I would recommend a different book.  Like \\"Time Trek\\".	2005-02-16

After reading this book I went and read all of his other books, that is how much I enjoyed this book.  This is a \\"WOW\\" book.  It has everything.  Story after story and example after example.  The references that he gives are not your typical examples, but rather some brilliantly selected issues that just makes you want to put the book down and go...\\"HUMMMM\\".  This is a book that deserves praise.  This is quite an outstanding book.  I wholly recommend it.  You will not regret it.	2005-02-16

This book is a summary of Mankinds past and his future.  All obtained through the use of Remote Viewing.  The stories and incidents within these pages are wonderful and interesting.  I was amazed to see what the Remote Viewers thought about how the Pyramid was built.  I enjoyed reading about Jesus.  I was particularily interested in our future and the events involved.  Since I read the book, a number of predictions for the short term future has come true.  So it really makes you wonder.  This is an extremely easy book to read.  It is fun and enjoyable.	2005-02-16

There are some interesting reads here, and certainly some parts of the book go faster than other parts.  It can get bogged down in some places.  There is some really good stuff here, and I do recommend this book, but it is not for someone who doesn't understand what Remote VIewing is or what it's potential is.  While there is a nice portion of the book that deals with these subjects, it is not filled with the \\"WOW\\" that would make a novice Remote Viewer reader to persue the issue any further...I THINK...But I could be wrong.

This is a good handbook, and it is an excellent resource if you wanted to try Remote Viewing yourself.  However, it is a bit dry at thimes.  It is loaded with all manner of great subjects and specifics related to the \\"how to\\" of remote Viewing, but this is not a casual book.  I would recommend this book only if you were interested in trying to Remote View on your own and wanted a guide to learn how to do it.  It gives a great background and history behind the process, but this is certainly not a book for the non-believers or skeptics out there.	2005-02-16

My initial reaction to it was astonishment that someone would publish such a crazy work.  But now, after reading it, I am not so sure.  Certainly a worth while read.

OK there are things going on with the Sphinx.  Things that are unexplained.  This book opens the door to the thought process related to the dating of the Sphinx and the stellar alignment of it.  I found it a general good read.  Slow in some parts, and Graham hancock spent a bit of time going over and over on some basic points.  But after reading the book, you should find yourself in agreement that the actual age of the Sphinx is much older than what is conventially established.

This is a great book about Pole Shifts.  Personally, I agree with the current Geological Thought on this matter - which is that pole shifts do occur and that they have occurred in the past.  Where I disagree with the current historical philosphy is that the pole shifts do not alter regional climate and thus impact civilizations.  That is where this book comes in.  It makes a long standing and firm argument for periodic catastrophic events.  The book documents the points and theories in an enjoyable manner and is a quick and easy read.  This is a MUST READ book for anyone interested in the mysteries of ancient civilizations and geologic processes.  I rate this book most highly.	2005-02-10

I believe that anyone who wants to confirm their doubts of one side of the argument or the other should read this book.

This book opens a door to possibilities that might be real.  His basic point is soild, and amazing in it's simplicity.  He relates the change in orbital rotation with that of the migration of the magnodynamic flux of the Earth.  This, while is completely well known in the world of geology, is little understood elsewhere.  That is too bad, because his theories answer many questions....many that cannot be answered using the current accepted evolutionary theories.  This is not a book for someone to read cold turkey.  I would suggest some fine books on alternative science and history first.  But once read, his points are clear and stunning.  Was there a global seafaring culture in 75,000 BC?  I don't know, but he certainly has opened the door to speculation.	2005-02-08
