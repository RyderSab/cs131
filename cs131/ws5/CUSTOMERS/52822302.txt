The author incorporates anecdote after anecdote, none lasting more than a couple of paragraphs.  As others have noted there are better golf books out there, but this one is a very quick read, and you may come across a few stories that you haven't heard before.  Recommended more for the golf novice (like myself) than the hardcore fan.	2005-03-01

It is an incredible story, about incredible men, facing incredible odds.  The chances of getting back to earth after Apollo 13 encountered her &quot;problem&quot; were very low.  It was the brains of NASA (&quot;work the problem people&quot;) and the cool demeanor of the three astronauts, who were under incredible stress, that made the successful return possible. <br />The audio version was incredible.  The narrator was very good and they incorporated actual transmissions from Apollo 13 which gave the listening experience an authenic touch.  Jim Lovell read certain parts of the book and that also gave the audio book a more personal touch.  I think some of the more technical aspects of the book were easier to absorb in an audio format.  <br />Overall, a great story of heroic achievment for the American space program.  Apollo 13 may not have made it to the moon, but they made it home, when home seemed very far away.	2003-04-20

Zalin Grant's \\"Over The Beach\\" is an account of fighter squadron 162 from the aircraft carrier USS Oriskany during the Vietnam war.  Grant does a masterful job of blending the history, with the real lives of the people who were a part of that history. <br />The reader feels the palpable emotions of the pilots as they \\"crossed over the beach\\" on their way to targets in Hanoi and Haiphong.  The squadron was incredibly successful, but with that success came great loss.  Many pilots were shot down over North Vietnam where there was almost no chance of rescue.  The reader also hears from those pilots who became prisoners.  <br />Grant incorporates the history of the air conflict into the book as well.  Johnson, Nixon, McNamara, and Kissinger all weigh heavily into this account.  The politics of the conflict led to a war fought on confusing terms. But this doesn't read like some history text.<br />From the terror of carrier landings to the wild frat boy parties aboard the Oriskany, this book covers it all.  From the adulterous behavior of many of the piots to the gut-wrenching roller coaster of emotions suffered by an MIA's wife, this book does not hold any punches.  It may be hard to find this book (some libraries may have it) but it is one of the finest (and personal) accounts of carrier warfare in Vietnam I have ever read.	2003-04-20

It is hard to understand the context of the mission today, but Zimmerman relates world events that happened while Borman, Anders, and Lovell circled the moon.  While sometimes effective, I also found this jumping around to other world events distracting at times.  That is why I gave this book a 4 star rating instead of 5.<br />Of course I understand why the author did this.  He was attempting to put the mission into perspective in relation to what was going on in the world in the late 60s.  I think this book shines when it focuses on the mission itself.  This was a heroic mission flown by heroic men.  Without Apollo 8 there would have been no Apollo 11.  It is hard to remember when man flew to the moon but this book will help you remember.  Recommended.	2003-03-22

This was a great story of brave men in a life and death situation.  Through tragic mistakes the USS Forrestal lay off the Vietnam coast engulfed in fire and in danger of going down.  But thanks to the heroic sailors and cool under pressure captain the ship was saved and later fully repaired.<br />I listened to the abridged audio version of this book.  I thought Kevin Conway did an excellent job narrating this book and my attention never lagged once.  The story and the narrating were as good as it gets.  Inagine yourself with bombs \\"cooking off\\" around you with jet fuel spilling everywhere and death staring at you in the face.  These sailors never wavered.  There are some incredibly poignant passages in this book about men who knew they were going to die but still did their job.  This is a great (audio) book!	2003-03-12

This is a very honest narrative about a military unit most people know nothing about.  Someone has to be the first in to a landing zone and guide the \\"birds\\" in.  That's what the Pathfinders do.  They are the eyes and ears for the helocopters.<br />This is an especially good book because Richard Burns seems like somebody you knew in your neighborhood growing up.  This isn't a story about some larger than life make believe hero.  This is the real life kind.  The book is hard to put down and will leave you wanting to learn more about this small unit of men who wear the black hats.  <br />I was sad to read in the introduction about Richard Burns recent death to cancer.  It is good to know that his memory will live on with this book.	2003-02-11

This is an enthralling Harry Bosch mystery with Harry investigating a 20 year old homocide when some bones are unearthed.  This is a classic Connelly page turner.  If you like the past Bosch books you'll like this one.  This is not the best of the series but it is better than &quot;A Darkness More Than Night&quot;.  Not as many twist, turns, and surprises as the other books but still at least one good one included. The reader can sit back and relax while reading &quot;City of Bones&quot; knowing Harry's on the case.	2002-11-14

The author gives great details of the rescue itself as well as what life in the camp was like.  This was an important mission because all allied prisoners were going to be rescued from the camp, and it was to be the proving ground for the Rangers who were in their infancy. Highly recommended patriotic read that will leave the reader with a good feeling afterward.	2002-10-31

I have also read Michael Connelly's non Bosch books.  While I have not liked any of them as much as &quot;Harry&quot;, they have all been enjoyable reads.  &quot;Void Moon&quot; is no different.  I was quickly engrossed in the storyline and the book never bogged down.  I think that Connelly keeps the &quot;Harry Bosch&quot; character fresh by doing other works.  In my opinion Michael Connelly is the best crime/mystery author writing now and you won't be disappointed with &quot;Void Moon&quot;.	2002-04-21

It takes you back to the great Yankee teams of the late 70s.  &quot;Balls&quot; seems quite tame today, but it was hard hitting when it was released in the mid 80s.

This book tells the story of a shot down and captured PBY crew in the pacific in WWII.  It recounts the brutal, sadistic torture and murder these men ultimately faced at the hands of their Japanese captors.  The author is the son of one of the murdered airmen.  This is a poignant, personal account of a story that needed to be told.  The reader will have feelings of rage at the way the Japanese treated the Americans and the way the American Government did NOT treat those Japanese responsible for war crimes.  Very few Japanese were held accountable for their actions in the rebuilding climate of postwar Japan.  I'm glad this story was told and I hope it is read by many.  God bless the souls of all the airmen on that last flight of PBY No. 08233.	2001-12-25

I found this to be a compelling book.  I was never bored while reading this book.  This book chronicles the patrol of an SAS unit behind the lines in Iraq during the Persian Gulf war.  Their mission was to locate and knock out the SCUDS as well as destroy communication lines.  The patrol lead by Andy McNab had problems from the start and four members were captured by the Iraqis.Half the book deals with the patrol before the capture, and half with life as a prisoner of war.  The entire book is a fascinating account and worth the read.  The SAS is a secretive organization and this book is a look inside.  Some of the story seems larger than life, but I guess the SAS is larger than life.	2001-12-03

Duane Schultz offers a well researched and very readable history of this battle, which while an American defeat was also one of its earliest victories.                                                       While the Island was eventually surrendered to the Japanese, the price they had to pay for it was very steep.  The American public needed good news at the start of the war, and for sixteen days the Wake Island defenders gave it to them.                                                             Also covered here are other topics of interest including; Japanese war crimes (100 civilian construction workers were executed by the paranoid Japanese), and the controversy of who was in ultimate command of Wake Island (Cmdr W. S. Cunningham was the senior officer on Wake Island but was completely left out of all accounts of the battle, including award citations).

The reader feels a part of the action because this is not a story written by an Admiral, General, or historian, but rather by one man who was part of a boat crew who was just trying to stay alive.Highly recommended for readers interested in riverine warfare or the Vietnam War.

Paul Scotti has written an excellent account of the CG's little known contribution to help win the war in southeast asia.  All areas are covered here including Operation Market Time, ATON, Port Security, LORAN, as well as Search and Rescue (SAR is the primary mission of all CG assets and the mission most familiar to the public).  This book is highly recommended to all those interested in the USCG, or the Vietnam war.

All the stories deal with survival at sea in the waters off Alaska.  The stories are kind of repetitive but if you like the first one you'll like the rest.  The thought of finding one's self in the frigid Alaskan waters will make you pull an extra blanket on while you read.  My only real complaint is that I would have liked more details on the fishermen involved (background, etc) so it wouldn't just have been names floating out there in the ocean.  Overall, highly recommended adventure reading.	2000-10-13

It also describes the campaign John and Reve Walsh championed in the fight for children's and victim's rights. I found this book difficult to read because of the subject matter.  John Walsh decribes the crime in graphic detail, as well he should because there is no way to &quot;lighten&quot; a crime of this nature.  I am glad I read this book, but due to the graphic subject matter some may find this too disturbing to read. Having said that, I believe that anyone who cares about children will find this a very important, and relevant book to read.	2000-09-21

Major Damon &quot;Rocky&quot; Gause's &quot;War Journal&quot; chronicles  his escape from the Philippines by boat to Australia at the outbreak of  WWII.  This heroic escape is outlined in detail in this fairly short, very  readable account.

It tells us about the Battle of the Black Sea in Somalia  on Oct 3-4, 1993.  The Somalis refer to it as Ma-alinti Rangers (The Day of  the Rangers).  All Most Americans remember are the images of dead U.S.  soldiers being dragged through the streets by mobs of Somalis. That is an  image that stays with most Americans.Mark Bowden describes in incredible  detail the operation to capture top players in the Aidid clan, who the UN  felt was responsible for much of the turmoil in Mogadishu.  Minute by  minute narratives take the reader along with  the men of Task Force Ranger,  Delta Force, and the Night Stalker crews.  This book takes any glamour out  of war some people may see.  While wars are sometimes necessary, they  should be a last resort.  War is messy and people die grotesque deaths.   But when war is necessary it comforting to know there are soldiers ready to  go anywhere, anytime into harm's way.This book goes into some of the  fingerpointing you'd expect, but Bowden keeps the story on tract.  This is  a story about the men at ground zero, not what was happening in Washington.   He is diligent in covering the Somali point of view even though there have  been criticisms to the contrary.  There are lessons no doubt, to be learned  from America's involvement in post cold war conflicts such as Somalia.   Books like &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; create healthy discussions that may  not answer all the questions, but at least ask them.  The Battle of the  Black Sea was a tactical success but is perceived as a failure.  Even  though 18 Americans died the mission was a success.  Read this book to  honor those 18.	2000-08-10

With accounts from law enforcement personnel from the Coast Guard, US Customs, DEA and others, Mr  Fuss presents a very readable text with many exciting narratives. Included  is insight from &quot;bad guys&quot; as well.  Mr. Fuss stays away from  partisan politics, which is not easy in any volatile suject, such as drug  interdiction.  The men and women who have fought, and still fight, the war  against drugs deserve our admiration.  This book recognizes the efforts of  these ardent warriors.  As Mr. Fuss states toward the end of &quot;Sea of  Grass&quot;, &quot;We persevered, comitted more resources, ignored  defeatist media advice, and prevailed against the grass boats.

This is a very well researched, fast paced look at the world of U.S. Coast Guard smallboat stations.  These are the folks who come to the aid of mariners in distress, wherever and whenever called.  Since it is virtually  the only book on the subject I have nothing but praise for it.  Having  served at a smallboat station in Fla I agree with Senior Chief Noble's  assertion that Coasties at stations do have an inferiority complex,  compared to those afloat.  It's part of the CG psyche and probably will be  for quite awhile.This is a great book with plenty of spine tingling stories  about those who &quot;have to go out, but don't have to come back.&quot;   Check it out.  I also recommend &quot;Sea of Grass&quot; by Charles Fuss  about the USCG war on drugs on the high seas, and &quot;The Coast Guard at  War&quot; by Alex Larzelere about the USCG's role in Vietnam.	2000-04-21

Some may find her descriptions  tedious and drawn out but I believe they aptly describes 30 days at  sea.Capt Greenlaw attempts to give the reader a basic understanding of the  fishing industry.  This is sometimes drawn out a tad to in depth but this  is a minor complaint.  If you are looking for heart stopping action read  Junger's &quot;Perfect Storm&quot;, but if you want to know what 30 days at  sea setting and pulling back fishing nets is like, read &quot;The Hungry  Ocean&quot;.	2000-04-11

I would reccommend this book to those interested in the  early space programs but only after you read such books as  &quot;Moonshot&quot; by Alan Sheppard and Deke Slayton, et al.

I don't want to  be to critical of this book but compared to all the other Connelly' books  I've read (all but &quot;Angel's Flight&quot;) this was my least favorite.

This was similar to the first one I read, &quot;The Galton Case&quot;, in that it involved a twisted complex murder mystery involving a family and  close acquaintances.  Prior to reading &quot;The Blue Hammer&quot; I had  read some negative reviews of the book.  Maybe compared to MacDonald's  other &quot;Archer&quot; novels &quot;TBH&quot; is weaker, but I thoroughly  enjoyed it.  I thought this was a solid mystery and enjoy the  &quot;Archer&quot; character very much.  The only negative remark I can  make about &quot;TBH&quot; is that there are so many characters in it that  sometimes it gets confusing keeping up with them all.  Having said that I  still believe this is a solid piece of work, and for MacDonald's last  installment in the &quot;Archer&quot; series I think he did a fine job.

Vietnam era SEAL/UDT operations were covered extensively and with a human touch.  My only complaint (kind of a  big one for me), and the reason I didn't give it a five star, is that the  packaging of this paperback leads the reader to believe this is a work of  non-fiction.  The front and back cover do not mention this is fiction, and  only once I got home did I notice the word fiction on the spine.  The  author states in his review these stories are based on fact.  I just wonder  what is fiction and what is non-fiction.  Other than this personal  complaint this is probably the most readable and flowing book on SEALs that  I have read.

It is the story of the arrest, conviction, and eventual putting to death of Timothy Wilson Spencer for a series of gruesome rape/murders in Virginia in the 1980s.  The  murders took place in Arlington and Richmond.  The book focuses on  Arlington Detective Joe Horgas' investigation.  This was also the first  murder conviction that hinged on the breakthrough forensic science of DNA  fingerprinting.  This not only lead to the conviction of Spencer but helped  free a man who had been convicted of one of the murders.Paul Mones does an  excellent job of recreating the horrific crimes and crime scenes.  Spencer  was also linked to a series of break-ins/rapes that had been committed by a  masked man.  He was truely an evil person.  Mones takes the reader step by  step through Horgas' investigation.  He shows the reader the right things  that were done and also the errors that were committed by others.  I grew  up in Richmond and remember the panic that shook the city to it's core  during the &quot;Southside Strangler's&quot; 3 murder spree.  The number of  murders may not seem large by serial killer standards, but there was a  genuine fear in the city, especially by women who lived alone.  I also knew  one of the victim's mother.  She was a teacher of mine in elementary  school, so I always remembered the case.  A whole other book could be  written about the psychological aspects of the killer's makeup, but the  bottom line is this was an individual who ritualistically tortured his  victims and kept them alive for long periods of time before killing them.   Luckily, he was stopped.I have a few complaints about the book.  First,  Det. Horgas is depicted as a one man wrecking crew while all other  investigators are depicted as pig-headed or incompetent.  I don't believe  the entire Richmond PD was that inept.  It was pointed out that several  people involved had reservations about how Horgas came up with Spencer's  name.  While the evidence shows that Spencer undoubtedly committed the  murders, the question of how Horgas pulled Spencer's name out of thin air  is a curious one.  I have no doubt this can happen in an investigation, but  it is very coincidental that it happened this way in such a high profile  one.  My only insinuation is that maybe there was more information not  privy to the reader.  Also it was mentioned that animal hairs/fibers were  found but the author never gave resolution to this.  Did Spencer have a  dog?  Maybe I missed that in my reading.  These complaints are minor as the  author overall did an outstanding job. My only major complaint is that no  picture of Spencer was included in the photo spread in the book.  All major  players were shown including the man falsely accused, but not Spencer.   This was an error in editing.  My last observation is in regards to the DNA  analysis.  The author mentions another case involving Barry Sheck, where  DNA analysis was thrown out when the lab's quality control came under fire.   DNA fingerprinting is revolutionary in crime fighting but it is only as  good as the people analyzing the samples.  Spencer was undoubtedly guilty,  but for the sake of innocent persons accused the labs doing the tests have  to be closely monitored.  The Spencer case is also mentioned in John  Douglas' &quot;Journey into Darkness&quot;.	1999-03-24

I did not enjoy it as much as the previous two Bosch books but that is hardly a major criticism.  Connelly has fleshed out the Harry Bosch character quite well in this  cop/psychological thriller.  After Harry loses his cool and attacks his  boss he gets suspended and sent to the department shrink.  During this  suspension Harry decides to investigate the thirty year old unsolved  homocide of his mother.  Connelly succeeds on several levels with this  book.  First this is an excellent police procedural.  Second, Connelly has  Harry wrestling with his demons while investigating his mother's homocide.   This really broadens the character of Harry Bosch. I also like the  character of Jazz who is Harry's love interest.  My major complaint about  the novel is that there is one to many plot twists for my liking.  Not a  major detractor though.  Overall a good book.  I look forward to  &quot;Trunk Music&quot;.	1998-10-30

Great photos accompany a  readable text spanning the film great's lifetime.  Bogie had an aura around  him and this comes out in this book in photos such as the two on pp 156-157  where the original tough guy has Bacall on one arm and Norma Jean on the  other.  With Bogie what you saw was what you got.  If you liked what you  saw then check out this book.	1998-10-21

The text is minimal amounting to more or less captions for the  photos but you don't buy this book for the words.  The photos do all the  talking.  Bogie was one of the greats and you can see it in this book.	1998-10-21

I had heard  RM  compared favorably to Hammett and  Chandler and the comparisons are  just.   &quot;The Galton Case&quot; digs into the secrets  long hidden by a  well-to-do California  family.  Macdonald keeps the story line  flowing  with twists and turns and  surprises to the bitter end.  I would of   appreciated a little more development  into the &quot;Lew Archer&quot;  character.  His  likes and dislikes, his history, more  character  development.  This is a minor  criticism though.  Overall this is crime   fiction at it's best and I will read  more.	1998-10-12

Very  similar to  the rest of the series with Archy being  assigned a case from  his father and then  driving around Palm Beach and  interacting with the  rich and famous.   Enjoyable though.  Make sure you have a  dictionary  handy.  I'm looking forward to the next McNally mystery.	1998-09-22

I was very eager to read a  Hoke Moseley mystery.  There is no  doubt that Willeford can write and  he deals out endless character  development.  My complaint is that  until the flurry of excitement at  the end, things just move to slow.  I don't always sympathize or  identify with Hoke Mosely either.  I  have a copy of &quot;The way we die now&quot;  and will give Willeford and Hoke  another shot.  &quot;Sideswipe&quot; wasn't a  bad book entirely, but at times it  was a boring book.	1998-05-15

Mr. Junger develops a story far more frightening than any Koontz or King novel.  I was out in a Coast Guard boat (UTB) off of Florida on Halloween day 1991 and conditions there, while far, far, far less extreme than up north, were awe-inspiring.   Junger's description of storm formations, wave heights, and ship construction were first rate.  He does a credible job of piecing together the last hours of the &quot;Andrea Gail&quot; and the terror the crew must have felt.  And the chapters devoted to the U.S. Coast Guard and Air National Guard rescuers made me feel proud to have served. Lastly if people don't believe in at least the possibility of a 100 ft wave than they don't know the ocean. Anything is possible.  Overall an outstanding book.	1998-04-10

Harry Bosch and the other characters are so real that you can smell the cigarette smoke, taste the border dust, and see the blood on the bathroom floor.  If you enjoy modern hard-boiled detective writing than this is the book for you.	1998-04-07

I enjoyed the first two books in the series better (McNALLY'S SECRET and McNALLY's LUCK) because CAPER was fairly predictable as other reviewers have noted.  But if you enjoy the series you'll enjoy this book. Nothing outstanding but still solid.	1998-03-22

The creation of  &quot;Delta Force&quot; is a topic that should interest all military history buffs.  Col Beckwith gives a blow by blow account of the obstacles endured in creating Delta.  He sometimes drowns you in the day to day bureacratic fight but the reader gets an appreciation for the difficulties he faced.  Col Beckwith gives an excellent narrative of the fiasco at &quot;Desert One&quot; in 1980  while attempting to save the American hostages in Iran. It was a difficult time for all Americans and most would not wish to be  reminded, but lessons are to be learned.  And in order to learn those lessons Col Beckwith takes us back to that night in the desert.  Overall a very informative read.	1998-03-11
