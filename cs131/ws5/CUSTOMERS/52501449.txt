The book is not technically deep nor philosophically profound, but well written and pitched at an appropriate level for the average starting web-logger.<br /><br />One of the ways to measure the value of a book is to ask if the reading of it has changed the way one does things. The question is not so much \\"What did I learn?\\" but \\"What impact did this have on what I do?\\"<br /><br />The answer, of course, is person bound; a book that has changed the way I behave may have no impact on someone else's actions. Rebecca Blood had a direct influence on my projects. For example, WikiDiction now has a space for linking to relevant quality blogs; added after finishing the chapter \\"Finding an Audience\\".<br /><br />Nice work Rebecca.	2005-10-08

The imaginative poetic style of this outstanding first novel evokes the opulence of Garcia Marquez while weaving a rare tapestry of human tenderness, fragility and flaw. Falconer's eloquent tale of obsession, beauty and madness is a tribute to the beauty of metaphor and entices the reader to savour to the author's own passion for images. Her novel approaches a certain reign of the imagination and the age-old literary quest to portray essentially incommunicable emotions. The Service Of Clouds evokes magnificently the mystical beauty of the Blue Mountains and charts the obsessivve tenacity of a women who grasps for love and is ultimately smothered by it. A magnificent novel of haunting and persistent beauty.	2005-09-06

It is comprehensive - perhaps a little too wordy at times - and packed with practical advice. The lists of questions which come up regularly in this book can be turned into management check lists. Scott Berkun's points anticipated many of the problems I have since encountered; I am now reading this book for the second time and noticing things that were missed on the first read.

Alas, that was not the case. The authors write, in a gesture alluding to scholarship: \\"Evidence shows that customers are demanding clearer information from their solution providers...\\" What evidence? It was not given, nor references to studies showing it. Read this book to find out how not to write.<br /><br />Better still, get yourself a good book on this topic.

It is also a literary masterpiece. Here is a scene in which the boy, still early primary school age, is listening from another room in the house to his parents finishing off an evening meal with a guest. The boy has detected the marriage breaking down, the emotional distance between his father and mother, his mother's desperation as she tries to belong to the husband she is losing, and his fathers' attention going preferentially to the guest, a colleague from work named Bob Painter. In the next chapter the father leaves his family to move in with Bob Painter, but we don't know that yet. The boy's silent desperation echoes his mother's. The atmosphere is conjured in a few sentences, which a lesser author might have needed pages to describe.<br /><br />I listened to the sound of them on the patio, my mother's voice, now drunk, the loudest. I imagined my father using the word \\"guinea,\\" and I wanted my mother to lift a gun and shoot Bob Painter. Or I could do it. I could take an ax and finish the job. But my mother made her loud noises and then her murmuring assenting ones, and the men's voices rode under hers. It was like they were going away from her secretly, under the cover of night, throwing their voices like ventriloquists, so that she could not know how far away from her they already were.<br /><br />Get the book and judge for yourself.	2004-12-10

They come to this unlikely idea at the end of a life long friendship because - it seems - of perceived slights although this too is not adequately charted in the novel, and both come to the same idea at the same time and select the same method. They elect to go to Amsterdam where they find corrupt medical practitioners who agree to commit euthanasia for large sums of money paid in cash. They pull off this trick by falsely identifying themselves as the other, then switching places at the last moment, and so simultaneously kill each other. The mechanics of this unlikely swap are not adequately explained, but in more essential ways the plot line is deeply flawed.<br /><br />The description of the place could not be more wrong; not that McEwan got things like street names in Amsterdam wrong. His researchers made sure of such trivial accuracy. It is his complete failure to understand the Dutch society and her institutions that ruins the book.<br /><br />The Netherlands, and especially its capital, Amsterdam, is - in the minds of many native English speakers - a den in iniquity, showing how little they know about this, arch conservative and, in many ways, intolerant country. This simply could not happen. Euthanasia is strictly controlled in the Netherlands. There is compulsory notification to the Department of Justice, independent medical examination of the dying patient by at least two physicians who must lodge their reports with the authorities, and an independent counselor must give guidance to the patient,  a lawyer is appointed to wrap up the affairs of the patient taking care of final taxes and distribution of assets to the heirs, following which there is a required period for re-consideration, and an independent psychiatrist must judge that the patient is not making the decision in a desperate moment of despair or treatable depression but is fully competent and capable of making an informed decision, and a final family reconciliation in which survivors of the patient are also able to apply for and receive counseling, and then the actual day of death in which there must be certain people present as witnesses. A sort of ritual takes place, a kind of funeral at which the dying person may be able to listen to his or her eulogies. Actually the Dutch society is drowning in rules and regulations. A more credible book would describe the adventures of people who die of old age while waiting in Kafkaesque lines, but that would not win any prizes; the suspension of action has already been done in \\"Waiting For Godot\\".<br /><br />The story told by McEwan, at least this main subplot, could not possibly happen. It is actually the fantasy of an ignorant English author, serving his readers the jingoistic moral saber rattling that foolish people need in order to reaffirm their perceived cultural and individual superiority over the persons of a foreign country they do not understand and have no inclination to learn anything about.<br /><br />The English way of committing euthanasia, in which nothing official is arranged, and decisions are made in an ad hoc manner behind closed doors, make it more likely that Dutch people would go to the UK to find corrupt doctors for such a deal; assuming that the unlikely plot could be taken with a sufficient serving of suspended disbelief by readers anywhere.<br /><br />Why this won the Booker Prize, I cannot fathom.

This easy-to-read book, which paints the history of pre-modern philosophy in broad strokes, makes up for the lack of detail by giving us a nicely integrated panoramic view. It has been said that all of modern philosophy is little more than footnotes to Plato, Aristotle, the Sophists and the Skeptics. There is some truth in that; in any case, this book reminds the reader of the ubiquitous contribution of the ancients to the philosophical construction of the modern world.<br /><br />The author's style includes plenty of pithy remarks, often amusing images and clever phrases that - had he been a political speech writer - might have become more widely known quotable sound bights.

Randy Slone regurgitates no one; he states in his own words, clearly and in accessible language for the non-specialist, established principles of solid state amplifier design, and places these in the context of his suggested projects. One chapter is devoted to twelve \\"ready-to-construct\\" cookbook designs, and full-size PC board artwork for several of these are provided in an appendix. In short, if you want to build and/or design your own audio power amplifiers, this is an excellent resource.<br />Randy Slone begins with the basics of acoustics relating to audio power amplifiers and methodically walks the reader through a variety of designs, ranging from old to new, and simple to complex. As one would expect, much of this information is founded upon well established research. There is also a significant portion devoted to new techniques and principles of amplifier physics which help to de-mystify amplifier operation and provide pathways to improved performance. Unlike many similar textbooks that focus on only one topology or design philosophy, Randy Slone examines the broad range of amplifier configurations and power capabilities, including mirror-image input stages, fully-complementary VA stages, paralleled output stages, and lateral MOSFET designs.<br />Randy Slone may be somewhat opinionated, but his opinions appear to be logical reflections of measurable facts; and as any good scientist knows, that what cannot be measured does not exist for the world of science and engineering. He makes short shrift of tube cult; these are devices that produce measurable distortion and can never compete with the power capacity of modern solid state systems. The writing style and technical descriptions are easy to follow although a background in electronic fundamentals is helpful. No more than high school algebra is needed. Occasional humor increases the reading pleasure. Randy Slone has the somewhat eccentric habit of discussing current flow as if it traveled from negative to positive pole, while the convention is to describe it moving the other way. Once the reader becomes accustomed to this way of thinking - not too silly for electrons do indeed travel from negative to positive - it becomes easier to read. It is a complete resource for designing and constructing your own high-quality audio power amplifier systems.<br />I am currently building myself six of Randy Slone's OPTIMOS kits after reading the book. The fact that Randy Slone also sells the kits from his web site is a highly positive feature. Imagine trying to source all those components and make the PCBs yourself. Furthermore, Randy Slone is always available to help with specific questions and suggestion on a one to one basis.

It is long winded without purpose, and repetitive. The grammar is not always very good. The writer's attempt to create a conversational tone results in too many sentences without verbs, and in parts is difficult to read for this. One also get the unpleasant feeling that the book exists to teach us a lesson on the vulnerability of women, perhaps also primal innocence, contrasted with the predatory sexuality of men and essential weakness of character. That, in any case, is apparently the author's view.<br />The first person voice seems at the start to be a boy, the youngest sibling of the Mulvaney family. However this fails at several levels. Much of the time the readers perspective drifts away from the boy's world, and becomes that of the all seeing narrator who speaks to us in a slightly pontificatory tone, reporting inaccessible details of the subjective experience of, for the most part, the female characters. In fact, the raped sister is the true protagonist. At another level, the voice is clearly that of a female; the focus of interest and the style of analysis is quintessentially feminine. The book could not have been written by a male author. This may have been a more convincing presentation had the youngest sibling been a girl. However, I don't think this book could be saved with small adjustments; it is a mediocre family saga with social political agenda. Not recommended.	2001-06-26

Books	5	6	6	N	Y	Model of good writing	This book could be used by an English teacher as a model of good writing; it is clear, direct and easy to read. McMath's experience scripting concise and informative advertisements and labels shows. The emphasis on food products dominates, which limits the scope of this book somewhat. Nevertheless, the principles which are illustrated by these examples are sufficiently general to be of interest to most readers working in other areas. The book not only deals with failed products, but also presents examples of the right way to do things. It is nicely balanced and informative.	2001-05-08

In the new genre of works that strike up a chorus of defence against the intellectual disease of postmodernism, this book by Gross and Levitt comprehensively surveys the field, critically analyzing examples of the \\"scholarship\\" from radical feminism, minority victimology, ecological fanaticism among others, is one of the best.<br /><br />The authors do not suppress that malicious chuckle which comes with no holds barred slashing argument, and at other times the cutting edge of understatement, which makes the book so much fun to read.	2001-03-03

This book is not an easy read for the author has the habit of alluding to rather than explaining the views he argues for and against. Norris has mastered a large corpus of postmodern work, genuinely striving to find something of value in it. He detects traces of critical analytical thought behind the smoke screens of obscurantism in the writings of Derrida, for example, and balances his arguments by emphasizing these. He argues that postmodern writers have encountered the same philosophical problems grappled by philosophers throughout history; it is the method, language and conclusions of postmodernists which set them apart; which, one is forced to conclude, does not leave much of value.<br />Unfortunately Professor Norris has absorbed a great deal of the language-salad jargon of postmodernism and generously attached to that terminology respectable philosophical notions which might not be shared by many. He uses phrases such as &quot;linguistic tropes&quot; and &quot;genealogies of ideas&quot; along side &quot;synthetic/analytic distinction&quot; and &quot;empirical methodology&quot;, as if they were expressions of equally valid philosophical notions. The term &quot;suasive&quot; is used when &quot;persuasive&quot; would have done just fine. This kind of thing, and the book is peppered with it, makes reading &quot;Against Relativism&quot; heavy going. It is worth the effort, however, for the encompassing analysis Christopher Norris provides and for the insights it gives into the shreds of meaning that can be wrung from some postmodern work.	2001-03-03

The writers presume that since the early development of human intelligence takes place within the context of our bodies and our interactions with the physical environment the cognitive mechanisms for abstract thinking are based on neurological layers built above the sensory motor modes on to which they are mapped. These are not new ideas, of course. The developmental stages of Piaget provide a parallel perspective on human cognitive ontology. Contemporary research in artificial intelligence presuppose the same. Lakoff and Johnson, while presuming the same, are not concerned with marshalling the evidence to justify this position. It becomes the ideological foundation of their broadside against the entire body of western thought.<br /><br />The evidence presented by Lakoff and Johnson for their hypothesis is entirely comprised of a linguistic analyses of the metaphors we use when talking about abstract ideas. They argue that since we are usually not aware of the sensory- motor and concrete origins of our abstract thinking the borrowed logic of the metaphors prevent us from engaging in true abstract thinking. Neither we nor any of the great philosophical forefathers of Western thought are or were aware of that. We cannot think what we think when we are are thinking, and neither could they. The entire body of Western philosophy can be reduced to a collection of metaphors for the embodied sensory-motor mind.<br /><br />The broadest criticism of Lakoff and Johnson must refer to the negative self reference inherent in their main argument. Their deconstruction of human thinking and all of Western philosophy is itself abstract. If their method gives us a valid critical method that leads to knowledge about the function of human minds and its habits of thinking, then Western philosophy too must preserve its claim to yield valid arguments and true knowledge.<br /><br />Despite this, however, these authors do make a valid point. Much of our language about abstract concepts is metaphorical. This insight is not new. Besides the usual favorites of postmodern writers such as Neitzche and Freud who both discussed (besides using) metaphor, the issues is not new to philosophical debate. Even Aristotle, the linguistic essentialist par excellence, talked about the use of metaphor. Besides the evidence offered by Lakoff and Johnson, there is a large body of evidence from evolutionary psychology, cognitive psychology and the study of artificial intelligence which contribute to the view of human intelligence, broadly speaking, as having been shaped by embodied sensory motor mechanisms and experiences. Unfortunately, very little of this evidence was marshaled by these authors. Lakoff and Johnson's chief conclusion does not follow from the data they present.<br /><br />Metaphorical thinking may be a barrier to pure abstract thinking but at another level it may be the bridge which enables us to grapple with concepts outside the sensory-motor and concrete operations of everyday life. Why it should not be possible to meaningfully map systems of abstract ideas onto the metaphors is not explained by Lakoff and Johnson. Simply to point out that the language of abstract thinking is metaphorical does not prevent it from being the language of abstract thinking. Lakoff and Johnson's rather cavalier dismissal of the entire body of Western philosophy is not convincing. The corpus of Kant's work, for example, cannot be reduced to the \\"strict father\\" metaphor which Lakoff and Johnson claim to find underlying almost everything he said; a description which in any case is dubious at best. Where these metaphors can be found, they do not invalidate Kant's systematic and monumental works, which have their own meaning. In some places,the metaphors seem to be found more strongly in Lakoff and Johnson's presentation than in the original works. Kant was mistaken in some central aspects of epistemology. His synthetic a priori judgments, which he took to be certain and necessary truths, became shaky with the development of electrodynamic theory in the 19th Century and lost all credibility after general relativity was discovered in the early part of the 20th. But Western thought moved on. Einstein freely used spatial metaphors to describe the formalism of relativity but these in no way invalidate his theory. It is interesting to note that the most abstract of contemporary theories of matter employ terms such as \\"spin\\", \\"color\\" and \\"charm\\" to designate formal entities which we know can have no such physical meaning; they are merely terms in equations describing properties of quantum waves. The use of these metaphors, as distinct from calling them \\"particle a\\", \\"particle b\\" and so one, has no impact on the truth or validity of quantum formalism.<br /><br />Where Lakoff and Johnson are able to demonstrate that philosophers have systematically used metaphors in their language, they have failed to demonstrate that the logic of the metaphors is carried over to the thinking of the philosophers in question to such a degree that their works are invalidated. Perhaps this happens some times - but not all the time to everyone. Lakoff and Johnson's arguments are often forced and not convincing. They are indubitably post-modern critics of traditional philosophy and need to be taken with a large pinch of salt (metaphor intended).the metaphors seem to be found more strongly in Lakoff and Johnson's presentation than in the original works.

The International Baccalaureate Diploma course, the two year European advanced  placement program, includes &quot;Theory of Knowledge&quot; as a compulsory  subject. For a long time there was no single text book suitable for this  curriculum; most university philosophy texts are too advanced. Popular  books, such as Carl Sagan's &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot; which is  excellent for parts of the curriculum, typically do not cover all the areas  required for a well rounded TOK course. Teachers of TOK often found  themselves thrown back on their own imagination and dependent on a m&eacute;lange  of resources. This book is the best publication for teaching TOK which I  have found. It is strongly recommended for International Baccalaureat and  other introductory philosophy courses.	2000-06-11

This is a tightly argued serious scientific thesis by a professor of biological anthropology  with an encyclopedic knowledge of linguistics, neurophysiology,  neuroanatomy and human evolution. It is an original work in which Deacon  sets out his arguments and marshals the evidence for a comprehensive theory  in a methodical and structured way. It is not for the faint hearted, and  reading it demands careful attention to the tightly written dense  structured prose; it is not repetitive and the logical structure of the  arguments is architectural, so that careful reading and a good memory are  essential. Useful diagrammatic illustrations help to make some of the  concepts easier to grasp. The effort is worth every moment. Deacon's  conclusions have consequences for philosophy and theory of mind no less  than for the central area of linguistics and the evolution of human  intelligence. This book has done more to shape and to consolidate my  knowledge of who we as a &quot;symbolic species&quot; are than any other I  have read in this decade. Strongly recommended.	2000-03-07
