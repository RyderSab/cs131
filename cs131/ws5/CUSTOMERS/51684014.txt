Almost every vignette of Native American and frontier life written by Peter Skenne Ogden (1794--1854) in these pages ends in death, despair and metaphysical dread.  A man has a nightmare in which he dreams that he dies, tells of it to expedition leader Ogden, then proceeds by his actions to make the dream a reality, with a strange twist of fate worthy of von Kleist added at the end.  A Native American who loses his only son has himself buried alive and stoically allows the sod to be piled over him.  People are hacked to bits by members of their own family.  A harrowing picture emerges of what it must have been like to live on the physical and the psychological frontier in the early 19th century.  The illustrations do not match the text; indeed they augment the strangeness of this book with cut-away views of a chief ordering a hunt from within the narrow confines of a crowded teepee (Kafka's Trial springs to mind); a hunter balances atop the back of a gazelle-necked pony with his gun held straight up to signal the presence of game; and on and on the dream-like visions with their odd perspective and doll-like characters proceed.  Poe would have delighted in this book.  If you're a collector of literary curiosities this is the book for you.  On the other hand, those attracted by a sanitized picture of Native American life would do well not to pick this book up.	2005-03-15

Written in a non-stuffy, unacademic manner, it is yet one of the most informative ventures into this topic, while remaining free of most of the jargon of Derrida, Blanchot and company. In addition, we are taken beyond the usual round of Homer, Lonnrot and anonymous Praise and Throat Singers and given a front seat at the Nuyorican Cafe for an ear-full of slam orality, which will definitely bring Professor Foley's lessons home to students attuned to Rap and Ten Mile.

Higginson's excellent review of the earlier, Echo Press edition of this book.)  I have Ueno Yozo's scholarly edition of Oku No Hosomichi which I've been going over, section by section, with a real scholar of Edo Japanese.  My little knowledge of Japanese allows me to understand the differences between modern Japanese and the original, and yes, there's a density, a quickness, and a terseness, in the original that Cid Corman's translation faithfully captures in English.  I give a great deal of credit for this to Cid's co-translator, Kamaike Susumu, and to Cid's love for just these qualities in poetry, which he learned from such earlier masters as Ezra Pound, and of course from his great teacher William Carlos Williams, and was on the road to perfecting for himself when he did this project and published it (in 1961) in Origin magazine.  Cid's style was a good \\"fit\\" for this project--in other words, as the Japanese put it--Cid had \\"en\\" or destiny when he undertook this translation with Kamaike-san, for the plain truth is, Cid Corman did not know Japanese.  Even after all of his many years of living in Japan, he was not able to speak, read or write it.  Cid was absolutely honest about this, however, and you'll see that he shares top billing with Kamaike-san on the title page.  Startled?  Well, I'd argue that the top English translation of this Japanese classic being produced by a non-Japanese reader, writer, and speaker, is not quite as startling as Stephen Crane's Red Badge of Courage being hailed by Civil War veterans as being the most accurate rendition of their experience of war in print.  Scholars argue that Crane's psychological dynamic allowed him to present the \\"truth\\" of conflict.  I'd argue that the same sort of dynamic--albeit stylistic--was at work with Cid and Basho.  On this point, I differ from Higginson.	2005-02-13
US	51684014	R6QW2HEHXEGBU	1558964487	301957898	The Other Side of Salvation: Spiritualism and the Nineteenth-Century Religious Experience	Books	5	14	22	N	Y	East and West Met in 1850	First, let me say that this is a pre-review given the fact that I am quite familiar with the material on Mr. Buescher's excellent website devoted to the primary writings of Spiritualism.  As this book is based on the website, I feel safe in predicting that this publication will be a fascinating read.  America, at the time of the birth of Spiritualism in 1849, was already experiencing the rise of Transcendentalism in the writings of Emerson, Channing, Fuller and the other members of the the Brook Farm Community and the Dial.  One of the great sources of this interest in things Transcendental was Coleridge's misreading of Kant, and Emerson's misreading of Coleridge, but the other was the translation of Hindu writings into English.  (Swedenborgianism also had a hand in making America a fertile place for Spiritualism, but that's another story.)  Buescher's contention is that Spiritualism was Asian-inspired Transcendentalism in a popular form, and he takes great delight in cataloguing the many creative expressions it found among its male and female practitioners.  There was Spiritual (Utopian) architecture, spiritual machines (the Rev. Spear's \\"New Motor\\") which offered unlimited sources of power, and plans for the creation of an \\"Ulimate Weapon\\" which would be so devastating in its destructive ability, that the world powers would see that war was, in a real sense, pre-empted, and would come together in eternal peace.  (That's a high order for what appeared to be a kind of tank, from the description of the plans given by spirits to its inventor.)  There was also a new kind of theater of improvisation inspired by Spiritualism, as well as group performances of  spontaneously generated texts that seem to herald our post-modern experiments in oral literature.  In short, Buescher introduces us to a veritable explosion of creative thinkers who attempted to transform religion, the arts, politics, race relations, and gender issues using the new mandate given them from table-tipping and seances.  He intoduces us to obscure  and eccentric figures, to be sure, but he also shows us that the writings of many of these long-forgotten mediums, visionaries and preachers, contained sometimes viable plans for the creation of a better society, all under the guise of a Transcendental connection with the Other World.  It is no secret that Madame Blavatsky and Col. Olcott began as practicing Spiritualists and ended by creating their own transcendental philosophy--Theosophy--and taking it back to India, where it became a real movement for social reform.  Strange to say, I'm a bit like a medium myself, right now, making pronouncements on an unseen text, but allow me to deepen this Transcendental Paradox by giving you my unqualified recommendation of The Other Side of Salvation.

Perhaps because of this focus on the more technical aspects, it loses the warmth of the Handbook in process.

I'm a fan of Thomas and I'm a fan of Elaine Pagels and what I came to this book for was an illuminating--and dare I say, comprehensive?--discussion of The Book of Thomas as only Pagels, a great scholar of these early texts, can give.  Besides mentioning Thomas as the kind of text that encouraged early believers to look within to their imaginative and creative sides (the \\"luminous epinoia\\"), she doesn't say much else.  I find this absolutely baffling.  Why include the text, and even allude to it in the title without discussing it?<br /><br />However, there are many illuminating points in this book that make it worth your purchasing it.  The creation of the dogma of the \\"one and only true church\\" is sketched out here in a passable way, and we are introduced to such interesting figures as Valentinus and the visionary Marcus, who saw the divine truth as a woman adorned with the letters of the Greek alphabet.  More about the poetry of Valentinus would have been welcome.	2005-02-10

I have a difficult time with the idea that a tiny poem written in any of the Romance languages--esp. English-- could be called a \\"haiku,\\" even though the author might include season words and even the 5/7/5 syllable count.  I would much rather call them epigrams, because they simply cannot give you the effect of a Japanese haiku. Anyone who argues otherwise is simply fooling themselves, and you.  Given all of that, however, Blyth and Higginson are good books to have on the shelf.  Blyth, I believe, is the better writer/translator and his sense of chronology and history is stronger.  In addition he gives hundreds of translated gems to admire from Basho, Issa, Buson, and others.  He also doesn't try to convince you that haiku can be written in English.  Higginson is the warmer writer and his generosity to the reader is apparent from the beginning, so practioners will find him perhaps more useful than Blyth in a practical sense.  I disagree with Higginson's history of English language \\"haiku\\"--there are some important people he simply leaves out, but he more than makes up for the omissions in other chapters. Both writers impart an enthusiasm for the subject to their readers. If you're building a haiku library and would like a great start, Blyth's four volume set and Higginson's Haiku Handbook are the way to go.	2005-02-10

No doubt he reeked from days on the road and a daily diet of sake and pickles and not much else.  His manners, too, were less than couth.  Not much about his personal life comes through the sometimes barely permeable wall between Japanese and English, and perhaps that's good for Santoka's English readers.  The Japanese are a bit more tolerant of this kind of behavior, especially when one has a real literary genius to contend with.  It's a fact: telling simplicity, and an incredible ear for saying (in the originals) just enough to make the magic happen.  I've wrestled with translating this man's work and English doesn't even begin to begin to convey what Santoka does with the layers of meaning in the Chinese characters (Kanji) as well as the very sound of the Japanese itself. Take, for instance, that famous poem that sounds a bit like a commercial for a clothing company (Blue Mountain is a clothing chain in Japan that sells cheap suits to salary men)--that goes something like: \\"Push apart/ enter/ push apart/ enter/ blue mountain\\"? Well, it mimics, among other things, the sound of a work gang in the original. No kidding--that repetitive drum-beat in miniature. You can't get that into English, folks.  No translation into English--not even these--can help you \\"get\\" Santoka's rightness as well as his breath-taking simplicity.  The most one gets is an approximation here, a pointing. The original Japanese is where the real Santoka shows his stuff and no translation, however deft, is going to give him to you. I lived in Kyushu for eight years and am familiar with Kumamoto and those blue mountains that you can't look away from.  On the train going to work in the morning and coming home in the evening I'd watch them and think \\"Santoka walked there.\\"<br /><br />This is a good book of translations, and one sturdy enough for those who want to take it along on their own forays into \\"walking Zen,\\" though only a fool would elect to follow Santoka's path.

I was even introduced to the Japanese name for the venerable Taoist sage mentioned above (they call him Roshi) as well as the Zen background of much of the classic haiku.  I learned about Kappa, the Japanese man-like water monster in these pages, fox spirits (or Kitsune), the concept of aware, or the mutability of things, and how haiku is this concept's best expression, although it can be found in Genji Monogatari and other works of Japanese literature.  I was given a useful introduction to Shinto and Buddhism in these pages as well.  My Japanese co-workers continued to ask me where I had learned of these things, because they themselves were unsure of them.  Above all, I was treated to great translations of Zen koans and poems as well as haiku, so I could see how the traditions over-lapped.  Finally, there are useful reproductions of Japanese haiga and scroll art in this book so you can see how the traditions translate into visual art.  If you're seriously interested in learning about haiku and Japanese thought, then this is the book with which  to begin.  Blyth lived in Japan for many years, was fluent in Japanese and much else besides and knew his subject.

From his own febrile, pathological alluvium located in a fertile triangle between Eros and Thanatos, anus and genitals, Bataille (said in the helpful introduction by the translator to be using poetry to reach the Eternal) comes up with cuties like these:<br /><br />The Wall<br /><br />A hatchet<br /><br />give me a hatchet<br /><br />so I can frighten myself<br /><br />with my shadow on the wall<br /><br />ennui<br /><br />feeling of emptiness<br /><br />fatigue.<br /><br />I have to admit feeling like that myself recently.

Grant, a Brit., gets \\"travel fever\\" and lights out on the same open road that Whitman, Twain, Jack London, Steinbeck, Kerouac, and scores of others celebrate in American lit. and popular culture.  Grant gives us an up-dated version of what the American open road is all about c. 1990 to 2003, with truckers, Native Americans, Vietnam Vets, the utopian Rainbow Family, the Elephant-like migrations of the SUV crowd and all the nameless, homeless, motel drifters and doorway leaners that we usually pass by in a blaze of chrome and a tinkle of \\"Route 66.\\"  Grant gives these people names and shows a bit of their desperation as well as their triumph in living a life of freedom in the post-modern USA.  Grant also gives us hints of his own unhappy life and how all the loose ends are finally tied together by the return of his roving lady love.  For anyone who has spent a day with their thumb out and a night camped under the desert stars, this book will be a reminder, and for those who haven't, this book might tempt them to give it a shot.

She lived most of her life in grinding poverty in the Oaxacan village of Huautla de Jimenez in Mexico, comforted only by the visions of the \\"little ones\\"--hallucinogenic mushrooms.  In the midst of one of her visionary encounters, she was invited to read a holy book and the words she saw there gave her the power to create long chants about herself as the healing woman/the sun woman/the silk scarf woman/the doll woman/the bruised woman/the tungsten woman, and on and on in a manner similar to the great \\"Thunder the Perfect Mind\\" text in the Nag Hammadi Library. In fact, some of the similarities are uncanny between this anonymous, gnostic-like text, and the words of this poor woman from the Mexican countryside.

It is, however, Michaux's connection to the author of Maldoror that draws me to him, and as in Ducassean texts, Michaux's writings reveal numinous monsters aplenty, strange landscapes, psychic flora and fauna that are noted, illuminated from all sides, catalogued in precise detail.

I have lived with this book on my shelf since 1973 and I can say that 1) it will indeed change your life and 2) it will teach you to strengthen your imagination to such a point that you will be able to \\"use\\" it to achieve certain things--whether real or the result of self-delusion, or real in spite of being the product of self-delusion, I will not begin to say.  But 3) this book does hint at, and eventually allows you to understand, the awesome reponsibility of traveling on this solitary path and 4) it will ultimately leave you wondering why such comparatively trifling achievements, at such great personal risk, are really worth the problems that one encounters in one's daily life through practicing the exercises.  Consider the fact that almost everyone who advances on the road to Hermetics endures chaotic lives and risks a terrible end.  Bardon himself died under mysterious circumstances, and he is just one of many.  Therefore, read the biographies of other practicioners first, weigh the pros and cons, ask if a controlled form of madness is your destiny, and by all means beware before using this book.

Indeed, it's almost like playing Bach to perform these sentences as they mount into paragraphs. One walks away feeling that one's thinking apparatus has been lovingly oiled, buffed, spun and polished. In addition, there's the incredible range of this man's thinking to applaud as well.  However, the problem for some people might be that the book in question, with its generous selection and its easy-on-the eye type size, is roughly the same dimensions as Johnson's brain, and probably a tad heavier, which mitigates against taking it out for a stroll stuffed into the back pocket for an occasional dip.  Instead it should be installed in the bedroom or the bathroom or any room where it can be consulted in an on-again, off-again manner.  I read the Rambler selections, the dictionary and the poetry in this way.  What's good about Johnson is that his prose is like poetry--it can't be read through just once, but demands re-reading, and each time offers yet another prize for the effort.  Funny that it all came from a grotesque hypocrite and snob who enjoyed bullying others and was none too clean about his shirt and linen.  Finally, brilliant as he was, I have to disagree with Johnson when he says, at the beginning of his Rambler Essay \\"The Need for General Knowledge\\" \\"That wonder is the effect of ignorance has been often observed....Wonder is a pause of reason, a sudden cessation of the mental progress, which lasts only while the understanding is fixed upon some single idea, and is at an end when it recovers force enough to divide the subject into its parts, or mark the intermediate gradations from the first agent to the last consequence....\\" (pg. 222 this book).  The more I understand Johnson and his times, his parts and his divisions, the more I am struck with wonder.	2005-01-31

In fact, I would like to turn one of Morty's quotable lines on its ear and say that \\"Feldman couldn't write a note unless it was literary.\\"  Of course, I'm inserting Feldman's name for the orginal Ives (see page 165 of this book), but I have to say that this composer provides in these pages the \\"narrative dark matter and coherent strange attractors\\" for his--in the main--disjunctive sounds.  With this book Feldman positions himself in the same great tradition of writer-musicians as Berlioz, while all the while disparaging that very tradition!  In fact, I would say that of all the recent experimentalists--Cage included--Feldman had to have been the most literary.<br /><br />What a fine mind, and what a great loss to have only one side of Feldman's legendary conversational powers in this book, but, until everyone in the world has sense enough to stop what they're doing and applaud Morton Feldman's brilliance and the END of TIME COMES and Feldman himself descends from on high seated on a golden bar stool, ready to take on all comers, they will have to be content with this written fossil.  And of course the music...but that's another story.<br /><br />This book includes an appreciation of Morty and his work by Frank O'Hara, another person I wish I'd met.	2005-01-31

Almost everywhere you see more reasons to think that the world is going to hell in the old proverbial handbasket: global warming, cretin politicians, mad scientists with more schemes for better ways to destroy us and people who blow you up just because you don't shake your head yes or no at exactly the same time they do.  This book will add yet another dimension to your worry.  After thumbing through all 298 pages you will have a pretty good idea of what waits to glide through your membranes, colonize your nervous system, gunk up the striations in your muscles, chew through the jelly of your eyes, swim in the fishbowl of your brain or perhaps has already gotten to work and is doing these and other nasty things even as you read.  Still, you have to hand it to all those sci-fi-looking worms and germs and viruses: they're pretty clever, and if you're a religious type, you might even see the many thumbs of Elohim at work--especially when author Carl Zimmer tells us that parasites just might be the arcane engine of evolution, and that adapting to parasites might be the real reason that normal gals pick guys with regular features and biceps, in the same way that hens pick roosters for the redness of their combs.  The one fact that has stuck with me after reading this book, however, is that Zimmer tells us that Toxoplasma \\"changes the personality of its human hosts, bringing different shifts to men and women.  Men become less willing to submit to the moral standards of a community....Women become more outgoing and warmhearted...\\"  This particular parasitic ghoulie can be easily picked up from the family cat, folks.  In fact many of you reading my words are already infected.  Makes us wonder how much of human personality is explainable by the number of parasites we unknowingly host.  Perhaps that sudden yen for a kosher dill pickle in the middle of the night might have a creeping cause, or even that get-well party for the associate that you don't particularly care for, the idea of which suddenly formed itself in a kind of Eureka-moment in the brain, might be tracable to the hormonal disruptors of something more akin to the arthropods than the angels.

It gave me lots of history, written in a \\"See Spot Run\\" kind of style for scientific knuckleheads who just might be poets or other kinds of humanities types trying to hedge their bets by seeing what the techheads are up to--and it introduced me to one major concept that I still chew on: Quantum physics doesn't necessarily pertain to things like the nanotech bull-doggings of incredibly tiny bits of matter that folks like Eric Drexler like to plan and execute.  In other words, it really is possible to know where a sub-atomic particle is in space--or at least know where it is in such a way that you can catch the little bugger and hitch it up to some itsy bitsy fly wheel, or tack it to a slice of silicon one or two atoms long and an atom wide, or etc.  I find that idea of the pure \\"fact\\" of existence existing--as in granuals, or other discrete units--relatively untouched by Schrodinger's uncertainy principal or the other Alice in Wonderland paradoxes that we've all been taught to expect when we approach the very very very small--refreshing, to say the least.  Indeed, I thought the microcosm was hide-bound in theory and that it somehow merged with some Princeton prof's blackboard if we followed it to the far side of the sideways eight, but to know that it is really THERE beyond all of that jazz, puts a smile on my face and a spring in my step.  Makes me hope that the far reaches of the Macrocosm can be found to exist in the same way without silly string, dark matter and black holes.  What a refreshing thought to look up at the night sky and not think of Stephen Hawking's career!  The other concept that I took away from this book was that nanotechnology could be pretty dangerous stuff and that--wouldn't you know it?--it's already being explored by the governments of the world as a better way of killing people.  So I was given a reason to cheer and yet another reason to think the world is on its way to hell in a handbasket.

I love Robert Lax's poetry, his way of looking at life, his calm--all of the things that Steve T. Georgiou attempts to capture for us in this book. On the other hand, Bob Lax would be the last person to opt for sainthood.  He was far too modest--far too intelligent--far too understanding of human nature--and far too much of an artist and creator to allow himself to be painted into such a corner unless he were indulging someone he truly liked.  That's what this book appears to be--Lax indulging his young friend. The questions that Georgiou plys Lax with are well-meaning, but rather simple minded and one-dimensional. He seems intent on the business of portraying Lax as sage and holy man--even down to the manner of the cutting of his vegetables and the eating of his yogurt, and he doesn't let up.  Although it would be interesting to hear the tapes from which these interviews were taken, it's obvious that Lax is playing along, and in several cases suggesting just the opposite interpretation that Georgiou seems almost desperate to make.  The end result is a two-dimensional portrait of Robert Lax that does not do justice to the man or the artist.  In addition, Georgiou adds a few Lax-based dreams and miracles into the narrative, which moves this book into the category of \\"New Age\\" writing, in my opinion.  On the other hand, there are a few good points about the book.  Lax discusses some of his influences and drops a memorable line or two.  For that reason alone this book should find a place on the shelves of anyone at all interested in this fascinating poet.  My hope is that a real study of the man and the work will be written in the near future.	2004-12-29

Not only do I love this book for its subject--trilobites--those fascinating relatives of horse shoe crabs and wood lice--but for the gorgeous and precise language the author uses to describe everything from the murky seas that blind trilobites used to inhabit to the vast sweep of certain strata of the earth's crust with its dents and bifurcations and crenelations indicative of ice ages ancient when the dinosaurs first came into being, and strange events that wiped the evolutionary slate clean when the earth's atmosphere itself was in its infancy. Fortey takes a close look at the mechanics of trilobite vision and lets us know not only how they saw, but what kinds of things they were witness to. He also gives us a quick and easy guide to the anatomy of the trilobite, and he starts it all off by quoting from a Thomas Hardy novel!<br /><br /> Makes you wish that Fortey was your next door neighbor and that those fascinating trilobites were still around in the back pond or in the parlor fish bowl to inspire yet another level of commentary!<br /><br /> All in all, a rich repast and perfect for summer reading.	2004-07-29

In my opinion, the most valuable essay is Thomas S. Hines' biographical study of the young Cage as he begins to grope towards a definition of himself that includes artist and inventor as well as his role as a gay man in straight society.  We see that Cage's experimental roots were clearly evident in his relationship with his gifted, albeit wayward, father, and his rather mysterious mother.  Everything was in place well before Cage's dramatic encounter with Suzuki's version of Zen, and it could be argued that Cage would have been Cage even without it.  There's lots to read and think about in this volume and I continue to return to it to understand this great American gadfly of the 20th century.	2004-06-14

Cid lived with his wife Shizumi in a small house on the outskirts of Kyoto for most of 50 years and poets visiting Japan would inevitably find their way to his doorstep to share his legendary hospitality.  Cid's existence was one that I would call &quot;splendid isolation.&quot;  Kyoto was Cid's Walden.  The post office was Cid's link to some of America and Europe's best writers and thinkers--including Noam Chomsky and Hannah Arendt.  Year after year Cid continued to do &quot;the work&quot; as he called it--rising at six or seven and wrapping up at about noon, with another writing session sometimes later in the evening.<br />For decades Cid did this, honing his poetry until it implied worlds in a very few lines. There are many spendid examples of this kind of writing in Nothing Doing.  &quot;Say it straight and say it plainly,&quot; was a kind of motto for Cid as he continued to develop and exercise his ear and his eye.  However, I believe that Cid began to run into trouble in the middle 1990's when he felt that his mastery of words allowed him to make direct statements tricked out in the form of poetry.  Cid, in my opinion, forgot the very basics that he had learned from his friend William Carlos Williams and that had allowed him to write the fine poetry that we see in such volumes as livingdying, and other of his books: in poetry we show instead of tell.  Nothing Doing features many poems that simply, and bluntly, state Cid's &quot;philosophy,&quot; and these poems are the weakest in the book and the ones I like the least.  Still, this book is good to have on the shelf.  One amazing poem to Shizumi contains the arc and sweep of a lifetime in the span of seven lines and its virtuosity alone is worth the price of purchase.	2004-06-14

This is a snapshot, if you will, of many of the giants fully formed, and some, like Gavin Bryars, in the larval stages of their genius, so it makes for a fascinating read.  Nyman's prose is pellucid, and his explanations cogent.  My dream is that Michael Nyman will someday return to update this book and offer some insights on the new, strange paths, experimental music has taken in the age of the personal computer, robotics and the Internet.	2004-02-21

It brings humor, a playful wit, and INTELLIGENCE to a subject that usually attracts writers lacking in one or more of these virtues.  This volume was culled from the pages of the Times and is jam-packed with jaw-dropping pictures, and text that takes one out of oneself long enough to contemplate the \\"reality\\" of time slips and poltergeists and levitation and Kaspar Hauser--all in the spirited spirit of the American literary phenomenon who went by the name of Charles Fort.<br /><br />The only criticism I have of the book is that, contrary to Fort who heavily documents his work--some of the most interesting material goes undocumented.  For instance, I for one would like to know where that fossilized sandal-print (the one that appears to be stepping on a trilobite) is located.<br /><br />Outside of this minor moan, the book is a gem worth collecting.	2004-02-20

No safety nets like clinics with clean needles and not even a job at Macdonald's, or a flop in a salvation army cot but begging and starving to death and people stepping over your body as it blackens in the street.  That's why so much of what these new outlaws say in their street poetry rings slightly hollow to me.  (that's not to say that America doesn't mangle and murder its children, but there are--admittedly--a few more ledges to land on in the U.S. before one dives into societal hell.)  And of course, among these outlaws is at least one college professor who is as much of an outlaw as my aunt is, and yet another who has a pretty good middle class house and a pension and a wife who indulges his writing the spare, misogynistic exercises he calls poems, and then there are the entertainers and recording artists like Bob Dylan who was never an outlaw to begin with and has made the fortune of record producers and record companies, not to mention his own.  So who's kidding whom with this title?  Granted, the book is seeded with fine--even great poems like Michael Lally's \\"My Life\\"--and legendary names like Bob Kaufman, Jack Hirschman and Woody Guthrie, but for every one of those poems and every one of those names there are a dozen from the posers and the wannabes--and yes, the cry-babies who want to point the finger at everyone but themselves and say a dirty word or two in the bargain to be \\"shocking\\" in a world that is now way past shock.  That's why a great part of this book is a cookie-cutter yawn, not even as interesting as a midnight Veg-O-Matic commercial.  In fact if many of these folks were given a spot on your television you'd probably turn them off--not from shock, not from the gut-wrenching pain they want to share with you, or from the intensity of their vision of the Truth that they've gathered from their lives with their torn and bleeding fingers, but out of sheer boredom.

Carver was a master at presenting the disillusioned and the lost in terse, understated, colloquial English that still is as crisp and fine as when it was first minted. Like Hemingway, Carver developed a method to freight the simplest words and sentences with a depth of meaning that can skew the whole story in an unexpected way, even in the very last sentence.  This takes craft and talent, both qualities that Carver exhibits in the highest degree.<br />Some may find his choice of subject matter rather limited.  His characters, too, often exhbit the same strengths and the same weaknesses (booze for instance)--and this may signal a kind of narrowness of vision to some.  Certainly Carver does not have the breadth of a Tolstoy or a Doestoyevsky, or even of a Faulkner or a Hemingway--yet these limitations, I would argue, are also his greatest strengths.  Though he does not have a universal sweep, Carver knows his territory well, and mines his subject in all kinds of fascinating ways.<br />All in all, this book is a fine introduction to Raymond Carver's work.<br />Carver's a champ in my book and I predict that some of these stories will find their way into the American canon right next to Melville, Poe, Emerson, and all the rest.  What a chuckle for Ray when he looks down from his writer's heaven and notices the gold stamping on the spine!	2003-07-20

Many of the utterances are familiar parables, but others are dream-like, perverse, shocking.<br />This book, too, could be used as an oracle.  The voice working here is not that of Jerome Rothenberg, but of something outside the boundaries of the finite self.  Each of the 100 poems included in this collection is the by-product of a shamanic ascent (or descent) into the Other that Rimbaud so revealingly invoked in his famous voyant letters.  The difference between the two poets, however, is striking.  Rimbaud was a brash 15 year old prodigy, ready to set off on an inward voyage, while Rothenberg, who has cast his nets across most of the world's cultures in search of the sources of the visionary, is here returning to the limitations of an aging self, as evidenced by the moving portrait included on the jacket of the book.<br />Interestingly enough, Rothenberg speaks of the shamaness Maria Sabina in his Postface and discusses her use of the \\"I,\\" in the mushroom-induced, hallucinatory chants that brought her to the notice of ethnologists decades ago.  He doesn't mention the fact that Sabina's shiftings from self to larger self were in search of a language that could heal the bodies of her clients.  This omission, I believe, is quite a telling one, for clearly Rothenberg is also on a quest for healing words in these pages.  In fact, one could almost say that this volume is one of the poet's most personal books, although the language, striking as it often is, seems to be the product of Oulipo-like processes.<br />Ultimately, every inward voyager returns to the vehicle that enables the voyage to happen--the body.  Rothenberg gives witness to his ascent in a vibrant language whose source is somewhere and nowhere, but is nevertheless locked within the interval between his own birth and his future mortality.<br />This book is a must read for anyone interested in new and experimental poetry, as it maintains the visionary tradition of people like Moses de Leon, Christopher Smart, William Blake, Walt Whitman, etc. etc., in a time when that tradition has become something of a cartoon in the hands of the neo-beats.

They finally push Rob too far when they tell him to scream like a chicken.  The jig is up, as they say when Rob finally \\"gets it\\" and says, \\"Hey, you guys....wait a minute!\\" The laugh track roars. Everyone confesses and Rob has egg on his face because he was suckered right along for most of the episode.  That's the feeling one gets after reading the first ten pages of this book and encountering such classic bits as:<br />\\"As with the Hull House, you can search for ghosts at the Lalaurie site from outside: simply stand in the shadow of the building and listen intently for screams of any kind.\\"<br />\\"Do not chase the Palatine Light or follow it out to sea, as many oceanic ghost lights have a tendency to lead the curious to their deaths.\\"<br />\\"Any phantom missing any part of its anatomy is potentially dangerous, largely because these ghosts are extremely preoccupied with regaining whatever it is that they have lost.\\"<br />If you think you have a ghost in your house, the author suggests:<br />\\"Give the ghost a room.  Set aside a portion of the house specifically for use as the ghost's private quarters...\\"<br />\\"Set Limits.  Let the ghost know what you will or will not tolerate....\\"<br />\\"Include the ghost during family functions... On holidays...have a little gift for the spirit...\\"<br />And don't forget to scream like a chicken!  Yes, these comprise just a sampling of Blackman's avuncular dolings out for anyone dense enough to take them seriously. Moreover, if you encounter a ghost, the author suggests some things you might want to ask it, like:<br />\\" What do you enjoy most about being a ghost?\\"<br />\\"Have you ever attacked anyone using your ghostly powers?\\"<br />\\"Do you enjoy frightening people?\\"<br />\\"Do you know what a 'ghost' is?\\"<br />And on and on. (One question that the author forgets to add to the list is \\"Do ghosts go to the bathroom in the other world?\\" It would not be out of place.)<br />Now this kind of cuteness would be tolerable in a child's book, but this book bills itself as a \\"Field Guide\\"--as in an exhaustive, serious, even scientific guide to this or that biologic, botanic, or geologic manifestation. Given that those more rigorous parameters remain unfilled, what we miss most is the sudden eruption of a laugh track at the appropriate moments while reading this book.

This is a good first novel with an interesting premise, and some fine spans of writing, but no classic. It would, in fact, be a much better read if many of the \\"and so time marches on\\" passages were edited out, leaving us with a page-turner of a novelette.  Many of the characters are one-dimensional, and a disturbingly Dickens-like \\"God Bless Us Everyone\\" echo is included at the end of a (now mandatory?) happy ending.  That's right--Susan Salmon sounds like poor Tiny Tim at the very end of the book.  Deus ex machina is alive and well since its rehabilitation in The Color Purple.  Not to worry, however, because I'm sure this will be a selling point for the folks at Dreamworks Studios.  The same folks who gave us technicolor heaven for gladiators and a final chance for a robot to find lost love in \\"AI\\" would find everyone (somehow) finding their way back for a final get-together and photo shoot at the Salmon's no problem at all.  May I suggest Robin Williams for the quirky murderer, who \\"gets his\\" in a way that is sure to draw whistles and hurrahs (and scattered laughter?) from the ladies in the audience?<br />Another disturbing point: Susan comes back from the dead to take over the body of poet Ruth and then proceeds to make love with her first flame, but the whole scene strikes one as morally ambiguous as there was no explicit \\"permission\\" given by Ruth for the ghost to gratify herself at the expense of the living body of her former classmate.  This is all, once again, part and parcel of the rush for a happy ending.<br />Besides these obvious flaws, there are beautifully written passages in this book that almost brought me to tears.  The author really does give us a convincing picture of the anguish and confusion that families feel when they have lost a loved one to violence.  There is something so sad, so poignant in the things that Susan says as she looks back from her \\"heaven\\" at the people she knew and loved as they go about the task of salvaging their lives. The author has genuine insight into these disturbing matters. Those \\"authentic\\" sections earn this book its four stars, in my opinion, and not the flawed workmanship.e task of salvaging their lives.

When I picked this book up, I noticed something oddly familiar about the picture on the back. Then a memory flashed of an enjoyable evening I spent curled up on the couch next to my mother back in 1964. We were watching an incredible, British-made T.V. special on ghosts that included an odd light moving about in a sealed castle room and the taped singing of what appeared to be ghostly monks. I broke open the book--and there it was! Mr. Cornell was featured in this show.<br /><br />This is by far one of the most intelligently written books that I have encountered on this subject. Mr. Cornell presents the evidence for many spontaneous cases and proceeds to give an admirably even-handed analysis. His cases stretch back over 55 years of research, and they run the gamut from obvious hoaxes to real puzzlers.<br /><br />There were a few draw-backs, however. After such a splendid show of intelligence, Mr. Cornell calls it all into question by including a photograph of miniature nuns and Indians (also tiny) engaged in lilliputian activities in tall grass close to a group of young girls. When I saw the picture I immediately thought of the Kottingly fairies, and I dropped my head in my hands and groaned gustily through half-clenched teeth when I read Mr. Cornell's attestation of probable authenticity! Shades of Conan-Doyle! The chapter on ghosts and animals was also a bit of a throw-away.<br /><br />All in all, though, this book is a must-have for serious researchers. Tony Cornell shows us all how it should be done in almost every case.<br /><br />If I were investigating an out-break of rampant, disembodied [pick your enigmatic action] and wished to choose my dream team, Tony Cornell would be my go-to man. A Michael Jordan of a researcher, and totally unflappable in the witching hours to be sure!	2003-05-25

Unfortunately that same policy of near-anonymity has been applied to the stories themselves.  Certainly many of the stories are interesting, but they've been clipped, pruned, and scrubbed of most of the who, what, when, where, how, and why that makes such \\"primary\\" accounts valuable to researchers.  In a sense these stories are like artifacts that have been lifted from their contexts and offered for sale at a flea market without any record as to where they came from or the strata in which they were found.  No matter how beautiful they might be, they're scientifically worthless.  Similarly, the anonymous editors were too careful to guard the privacy of their correspondents, and in so doing, edited the stories a little too closely, giving us page after page of supernatural sound bites.<br /><br />If you're looking for a shiver on a rainy day, then this might be the book to have, but if you'd like to try to understand more about these kinds of stories and why people find them of value in our culture, then this isn't the book for you. (The greatest, and most useful collection of ghost stories, in my opinion, remains the SPR's Census of Hallucinations from the late Victorian era.  In it anecdotes of unusual happenings are extensively documented, and the contexts clearly laid out.)<br /><br />Finally, there's no bibliography, or notes, or even an explanation about how the editors went about their anonymous business.  In short--a sometimes fun, but often frustrating read.	2003-05-22

Guess what--there's zero information about the Hemingway haunting in this book!  In addition, old Ataulfo of Madrid has less words wasted on him than an asthmatic's version of Handel's Halleluja Chorus.  Instead, what's offered here is a rehash of old stories (and old theories about what ghosts could be) with insipid, comic book illustrations.  Why this is called a \\"field guide\\" with its connotation of an exhaustive reference to every kind of manifestation of a particular phenomenon--be it birds, plants, or mushrooms--is yet another part of the mystery of why this book exists.

Though it's an \\"Idiot's\\" guide, the author does not insult the intelligence of his reader.  The tone of the book is just right.  The author does not give himself away as a dyed-in-the-wool believer, and neither is he a rock-em sock-em skeptic a la the CISCOP gang.  Instead, he presents the information in a light,fun,informative manner.  The bibliography at the back of the book warmed the cockles of my heart, as they've gotten to be rare as hen's teeth in these days of vanishing literacy.  In addition there are addresses of groups and other resources for those interested in learning more.  Maybe this book was not written for Rocket-Scientist- stiff-upper-lip-all-night-in-the-crypt-ghost hunters (a little joke there...a little irony...) but it covers many topics and it does a masterful job at doing so.  For instance, it gives a good accounting of Urban Legends as well as phantasmagoria...now where are you going to find that range under one cover?  Yes, Odgen does get a fact or two wrong, but that's a far cry from the usual rote repetition of hearsay that passes for fact in almost every paranormal book on the market. (And, sure, it's a good book for kitty-box reading if that's what your passion is!)  I also like his presentation of the historical beginnings of spiritualism, tracing them directly to Swedenborg (an old buddy) and Andrew Jackson Davis, the 19th c. seer before the Foxettes shuffled off with the show in Hydesville, N.Y.  Ilustrations are good too--many classics here, including that cute Drummer of Tedworth!  And--as a bonus--he includes a mini-Ouija board for some do-it-yourself yesyes fun.	2003-02-02

[... ]It's boring, it's tasteless, and it's unintentionally funny in places (just like the Passolini film of the same name), but it's a book that should never have been written, because it preaches Sade's philosophy of complete and utter selfishness.  Don't let the lit. theorists fool you when they praise this monster in the name of human freedom.  This is the freedom of Idi Amin, of Hitler, and of all the monsters we see on the evening news or perhaps encounter in corporate board rooms and other places where \\"self-made\\" men and woman titter about just whom they [destroyed] over to get where they are now.  The Sadean hero and heroine are cold-blooded users of people--including children--and even animals and corpses--on a quest for gratification.  They have not one iota of sympathy for those they use.  I suppose we could say this is a psychological document that deserves a place in human thought.  It's also an exercise in pre-surrealism, as Andre Breton justly points out.  But it should also be noted that de Sade's books have been the literature of choice for serial murderers and other criminals too various to mention.  Why spend time with a book that teaches us that men and women are meat machines and that life is only a feed and a shag?...  Here's your chance to share Sade's prison for 799 odd pages.	2003-01-31

I say he is at his worst, not because of the allusions and the lack of notes that allow us inside the particular cloister he inhabits (the culture allows us to uncover such things), but because he fails the first obligation of all poets, and that is to the mother tongue.  We do not find the old burly force of Hill at his best, but instead encounter effete language, lost in a perfumed cloud of erudition.  Lacking memorable language, we search for mastery of poetic form, but even that is denied us.  Hill sticks to a kind of slack, unrhymed counting of syllables, and we are all the worst for it.  Go back, Geoffrey Hill, to the vernacular.  Tell us more about that grandmother who made nails for a living, and leave the dons to their obscurity, and the priests to find God among the worm-casings and the dust.  Look at the best of R.S. Thomas, if you need to see again.  Look again, for God's sake, at William Blake before you sit down with your editor at Penguin.	2003-01-29

The story is a vertiginously creaky assemblage of vignettes that spiral in and out of each other in a bewildering--and sometimes belabored--manner. We often wish we could rip out 50 or so pages of purple prose here and there and throw them into the mouths of the nearest BLACK DOGS from Hades, but we must restrain ourselves enough to follow Melmoth (the chuckling friend--or should we say fiend?--of John Dee and Edward Kelly it turns out)--to his ultimate damnation. Scattered throughout the text are poppies of arcane lore--the very kind of volume that Poe would have had in his hands when the Raven came tapping at his chamber door!

Holmes does a fantastic job fleshing out the human side of Coleridge's genius and of giving the low-down on his masochistic relationship with the inferior (and rather creepy) William and Dorothy Wordsworth.  We find that Coleridge could have been a stellar performer in matters of British colonialism in Malta, had he only chosen to.  We find that he was in love with Sarah Hutchinson (his beloved Asra) and that he had a fling with a beautiful opera singer, while penning poems to Asra all the while.  And above all, we're given a key to Coleridge's bouts of dejection and depression: his near-constant humiliation because of his inability to move his bowels, brought on by his opium habit.  Many of these items I'd heard of, or divined from the standard texts I'd read before--but that last item was a real revelation to me!  This book is packed full of such revelations!  Coleridge steps forth from the pages in all his grubbiness and all his glory!  We must finally scratch our heads and admire such a rare creature that once roamed the fields of the lake district and the streets of London and environs.  Read it!	2003-01-18

This was an important time for Welch.  He was still attempting to find his voice and was just then making his first contacts with William Carlos Williams.  Later, when Welch became part of the Beat scene, he would look back at his own innocent days at Reed and try to recapture the excitement and importance of his explorations of Stein in his failed novel, I Leo.  But this is not the voice of the hard-drinking, semi-messianic Lew that we find crowding out his talent in his later works; this is the voice of a subtle thinker saying (without the smoke and whistles of today's English departments) some important things about Stein. Considering the date, this is an amazing thesis. William Carlos Williams admitted that he had learned some important things from Lew's thesis, and it continues (now in book form competently edited by Eric Paul Shaffer--but please don't hand this perfomance to Shaffer--Lew Welch is clearly the star in this show) to remain of value for students of Stein's work.  We only wish he could have continued to have written so lucidly and to have lived on to help us through some of the stranger developments of American criticism and poetry that now appear--unfortunately--to have become the norm.	2003-01-18

He speculates on the origins of vispo (advertising art of the 19th c., Mallarme, and especially Chinese ideograms) and leaves us with possible vispoetries of the future in the form of the Holopoems of Eduardo Kac and the melding of arts taking place on the world wide web. In between these poles Bohn gives us sensitive readings of Apollinaire, Severini, and the remarkable Mexican poet (and pioneer of Western Haiku) Jose Juan Tablada.  The Campos brothers, Emmet Williams, Dick Higgins, and a host of well-known writers are discussed, but it is the lesser-knowns and the samplings of work from rare publications that fascinate me most.  Names like Vicenc Sole de Sojo, and the Catalan vispoet J.V. Foix and his dazzling work are totally new to me.  Bohn includes close to the text translations of each poem as he explains it, so English readers can follow along without trouble.  Visual poetry is a vital current in both the art and literature of the 20th century.  Bohn gives thought-provoking definitions of the permutations of this compelling fusion of genres.  In short, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Get it from the University of Delaware Press.	2003-01-01

One gets the feeling that Kauffman dashed most of these poems off by cafe or bar light, and that's a big part of their power and their charm.  These poems are not &quot;finished&quot; in the same sense as the standard, tenured faculty M.F.A. drivel that's defined as POETRY these ticky-tacky days.

Gilmore gives us Oppenheimer the drinker, chain-smoker, cuckold, cocksman, lover, friend, good-guy, wise-man, and master of the directly stated, simply worded, poem.  Oppenheimer comes across as a person who was--somehow--more than the sum of his parts.  That &quot;somehow&quot; was his gift for living close to the bone, surviving break-ups and bouts with the bottle, and ultimately writing well.  No hagiography (as so many paeons to the Beats turn out to be), Don't Touch the Poet allows us to hear from enemies and not-so-impressed-ex-wives as well as life-long friends.  The end result is similar to Boswell's portrait of Dr. Johnson holding forth in his dressing gown: at one and the same time a bit off-putting, yet somewhat charming, wholly fascinating, and, one feels, totally true to life.	2002-12-15

There they are madly yapping away in front seat and back of Lew's jeepster Willy, rushing through the nights and days of innocent (well, really not so) America, and stopping once in a while to record it all in haiku.  It's got to be a classic, right?  Think again.  Sure there are one or two good haiku to be found in the collection, and Grey Wolf Press includes enough supporting material to add context and some pith to the purchase, but this book is really for the die-hard Gotta-Have-It-All-Right-Down-To-The-Laundry-Lists-fans of beatdom.

He must have been a fantastic teacher, though the work he discusses is sometimes (as he himself admits) still in process.

The Japanese, according to the author, were also on a search for the Western Paradise of the Jodo Shu and Shin-Shu Buddhists.  Somehow these two searches became one and the Japanese group over time became part of the Zuni genetic and cultural heritage. Davis points to linguistic, genetic and cultural parallels between the Zuni and the Japanese, reconsiders ancient stories of the Zuni, and presents some dubious artifacts as evidence for her claims.  I found myself wishing for more evidence more clearly presented.  Still, the thesis is intriguing enough to warrant four stars.	2002-03-13

The sampling of Villa's experimental and visionary work is good.  The memoirs and essays at the end of the book are superb.  One writer wonders why Villa does not appear in contemporary anthologies of modernist and postmodernist anthologies and posits the \\"otherness\\" of Villa as Philippine-American as the cause.  I agree, but also suggest that Villa's \\"wrestling with God\\" in the sense that Hopkins and the 17th c. Metaphysicals did, did not endear him to the decidedly secular critics of the latter half of the 20th c.  This book also includes short stories and Villa's own criticism as well.

Though the author of the work is personable enough and the book's layout and design is clean (and nice to hold in the hand and look at), I had the sneaking suspicion that this collection was written more for teens than adults.  The author gives us handy lists in side-bars about how to get rid of ghosts, how to tell if your house is haunted, and other goodies, but she does not go into detail when detail is most called for, especially in cases where the hauntings are well known and well documented. She merely mentions that this or that happened at such and such a time and then quickly--and sometimes abruptly--speeds on to the next story or the next section of stories.  This gives the book a &quot;light&quot; touch that is often a bit too light.  Another thing that I sorely missed is a good bibliography at the end of the book.  Entertaining?  Yes.  Informative?  Somewhat.  The photographs are good though &quot;informative&quot; shots appear to lose out in favor of &quot;evocative.&quot;	2002-03-09

Not only are we treated to 52 pages of a sparkling rendition of it, but the notes do not allow readers to review the problematic history of the Walum Olum manuscript.  In short, the Walam Olum is presented as a bona fide &quot;epic&quot; of the Delaware.  For those interested in understanding more about the Walam Olum and why Rafinesque created the hoax, see David M.

Pat Fitzhugh supplements the Ingram narrative with a mish-mash of material ranging from speculations on poltergeists, orbs, and vortexes to Calvin's Doctrine of Predestination.  Rather than a deft handling of many threads in an attempt to present a coherent interpretation of the story, the end effect is a kind of lumping together of ideas, the majority of which goes uncredited.  The most extreme example of this is the chart Fitzhugh gives of orders and sub-orders of spirits, along with their characteristics.  He gives absolutely no source for this rather elaborate taxonomy and the reader is left wondering exactly where this information came from.  (Andrew Jackson Davis?  Madame Blavatsky?  Fitzhugh himself?)  Indeed, the most maddening aspect of this book is the lack of a proper bibliography at the end.  Fitzhugh must realize that if he advertises that this book is the result of &quot;two decades of exhaustive research,&quot; he must present his research in a meaningful manner--that is, he must fully credit his sources so that others may go back to review them.  Otherwise he and his publishers are guilty of false advertising.  The second worst thing about this book is the fact that it is redundant and its bulk, as well as its substance, cries out for proper editing.<br />Having said that, there are a few things of value here: Richard Powell's Petition to Tennessee State Legislature for Financial Relief (31 October, 1837), allows us to glimpse the very real distress of one of the key players in Ingram's farce of 1894.  (To Fitzhugh's credit he does properly source this material.)  In addition the additional stories of odd things seen and heard by visitors to the old Bell homestead and the adjacent cave, add to the continuing Bell folklore.  To new-comers to the Bell witch story, this book will perhaps be of interest, although I would recommend that they take a look at Ingram's original, which is readily available on the internet.
