Okay, the parts regarding the selection of the Pope and the inner-workings of the Vatican and Catholic hierarchy was fascinating.  However, unlike _DVC_, I just could not suspend my disbelief and let myself be swept into the story, which, by the way, went on and on and on and on and... several false endings later, I just felt disappointed in myself for being swept into the hype.<br />I did like the clues and the ambigrams, and I did like descriptions of Rome and the art... like its sequel, _A&D_ made me want to look deeper into the artists described.  However, I shall not read any more of Dan Brown's books.  _The DaVinci Code_ is a much better story, read it and be satisfied.  Or if this was your starting point and you didn't like it, go on to _DVC_.	2004-03-29

Lord John Gray is one of my favorite recurring characters in Diana Gabaldon's _Outlander_ series.  He a man of honesty, honor, intellect, loyalty and humor; an equal to the talented James \\"Jamie\\" Fraser, and an accomplished man who has matured nicely from that 16-year old near the battlefields of the Scottish Highlands.<br />I view this book as the kind of sidecar book Anne McCaffrey wrote for her _Dragonriders of Pern_ series... an interesting character who fills in some of the details we didn't get in the main story.  _Lord John and the Private Matter_ begins shortly after Ardsmuir Prison has been ordered closed and Lord John has left Jamie at Helwater.  It tells us a little of his family and his life in the regiment, and even hints at how he learned to speak the German he uses so fluently in _Drums of Autumn_.  In typical Gabaldon style, we get the detail of atmosphere of mid-18th-century London... people's dress, food and living conditions... peppered with quirky characters and odd twists of plot.<br />That being said, this story was not as captivating as the _Outlander_ books.  Some of the references were confusing (the little looks and phrases), and the story itself didn't draw the reader in as quickly the main series.  It is no fault of Lord John... as mentioned previously, he is an interesting man.  Rather, it seems as though Major John Gray is a more distant character from his writer than Jamie and Claire, or Brianna and Roger... as if Ms Gabaldon is not quite as comfortable in his skin, writing *his* story, as she is with them.  Which surprised me, because he is a character of such depth when interacting with the aforementioned main characters.<br />I didn't find myself quite as catapulted into this story as I did with the main series.  However, by all means read this book, as I did, to get your _Outlander_ fix, and to learn a little more about an interesting character.	2004-01-17

Mainline and Fundamentalist Mormons may not like the way their founders are portrayed, but beyond that, Krakauer explores the roots of fanaticism... both religious and political.  This book does not necessarily challenge religious faith, belief in G-d, or even strong convictions.  It does explore why these beliefs may turn harmful; through lack of empathy and absolute conviction of the righteousness of their acts... whether that is cheating, lying, kidnapping, rape or murder.	2003-08-23

Tony Horwitz manages is an amazing writer; his clear, easy style had me laughing out loud several times. Still, he managed to draw a vivid picture of this most controversial explorer. Cook's \\"discoveries\\" in the Pacific and annexation of the lands therein exposed the cultures there to European \\"civilization\\" and all the inherent ills and diseases... is he a villain? Or was he at the very least an open-minded explorer, concerned about the effects his ship and those-to-come would have on the native peoples? And why did he make such questionable choices, especially on his last voyage? <br />Horwitz sets out on his own Voyage of Discovery, tracing three voyages of Captain Cook in the Pacific through Polynesia, Australia, and even the Pacific Northwest (he could not get to Antarctica, though he wrote about Cook's travels there). Most fascinating, Horwitz explores, with great empathy, the of the people and cultures of the places Cook encountered, and their attitudes (both then and now) to this most controversial man.	2002-11-24

It starts with the story of the Exodus, beginning with Jacob's dreams, and continuing through the Israelites journey out of Egypt.  It ends with a quick description of the Passover rituals and seders.  This book has just the right amount of detail -- not too superficial, but not so much a child (or an adult) will not understand.  I definitely need to add this to my collection of children's books of Jewish Holidays.	2002-03-30

My sister introduced me to these books a few years ago, which are the collected &quot;stories of the supernatural&quot; by Hawaii's reknown Time Walks host, Glen Grant. She gave me one a year as birthday presents, but I got impatient and tracked down the rest on my own.<br />His previous books (_Obake: Ghost Stories of Hawaii_, _Obake Files: Ghostly Encounters in Supernatural Hawaii_) focused on more folkloric ghost tales... urban legends, haunted places/objects, various spirits/ghosts/demons from Hawaii's multicultural heritage, etc. I think the reason I found this one scarier is because these stories are based on &quot;actual&quot; crime events... murder, rape, and suicide (the book includes a parental warning that, while he tries not to use unsuitably vulgar or graphic language, some parts of the book may be inappropriate for young children).<br />Mr. Grant is a fine storyteller (though there are several typos throughout the book, which I found a bit distracting). He has made a career of collecting people's personal stories of supernatural encounters and researched the connection to the myths and legends of Hawaii and her mult-ethnic people and acutal historic events. Even if you don't believe, it is a fascinating study in Hawaii's ethnic and social history. However, if you have spent any *real* time in Hawaii (I grew up there), you would have to acknowledge that the Land is very much alive... whether with local spirits, gods, or otherwise. My sister, an intelligent, practical person, could not read a few of his books at night. And if I still lived there, I would have been very uncomfortable too. OTOH, the stories also make me eager to find out more about Hawaii's recent and Ancient past. This is the mark of a good folklorist and storyteller.	2001-07-18

This is the second in the series, but does not feature the vampire bunny beyond a short mention in the first chapter.  Chester and Harold go to stay at a pet hotel while their owners are on vacation.  They are very uncomfortable, both with the people running the hotel and the other animals (six dogs and one other cat) boarded there... with good cause.  This is an enjoyable little mystery, but it does not have the polish of the first book, which James Howe co-wrote with his wife, Deborah (Deborah died shortly after _Bunnicula_ was published).  Harold seems just a little too bumbling -- I felt that the first book better captured the behaviors of cats and dogs (or at least the way they might behave when we aren't looking) -- and the wordplay seems a little forced.  However, I will continue to read the rest of the Chester/Harold series.	2000-11-16

The first is the most obvious: Katherine the musician.  Madeleine L'Engle captures the heart and soul of the Artist so well, that, while I am reading this book, I  can feel, for that fleeting moment, what it is like.  Then there is the  other thing that she does so well: tie the storyline with threads from  previous books.  Like the first reviewer, I too was very surprised to find  Suzy and Dave married (though there's a subtle hint if you read _Young  Unicorns_ carefully).  (Note: if you read _Ring of Endless Light_  carefully, Katherine makes a cameo appearance.)  And then there's the  message -- accepting your past, the decisions you've made, as well as those  made for you; taking the pain and just... letting it go (moving through it  to get to the other side).<br />I could go on and on... I re-read this book a  lot, and each time (as with the best of the L'Engle books), I learn  something new.	1999-09-20

Life's set-backs can rock us to the core, and we  can take time to grieve, but we should not turn our back on Life and Love  (of self, of others, etc.) and give in to Nothingness.

Ms. L'Engle's writing is  wonderfully clear and descriptive... even the most horrific scenes were  deftly, simply written, capturing the moment without yielding to the  sordid.  Also amazing is the retelling of the King David story, but from  the women's point of view; I learned more about King David in this book  than I *ever* learned in Sunday School!	1999-07-01

I was not prepared for *how* that  young man died; it rocked me to the core so badly, I threw the book across  the room.  I still burst into tears every time I read it... and I re-read  my Madeline L'Engle collection a *lot* (she comforts and teaches me every  time).  _The Other Side of the Sun_ has the clearest message of most of her  adult fiction: having a loving heart in this cruel world is not easy, but  it is worth it.	1999-07-01

The artwork and text are truly wonderful... a must for cat lovers and  dreamers everywhere.	1999-06-29

I think that Anne Rice is a very misunderstood author.  Her works explore things she's interested in on a personal level, which doesn't always appeal to her readers, who in turn get angry because a book isn't what they  expected.  Ms. Rice states right out in the beginning of the book that  _Vittorio_ is not about the vampires with which we are so familiar.   Instead, I believe she continues to explore her understanding of the spark  of the divine in us all.  This does not have the same lushness of  _Interview_, or _Lestat_, or the witch series, or _Belinda_, or _Cry to  Heaven_, nor quite the same erotic qualities, and I felt a little cheated  because of that.  It is, however, a good read, evoking wonderful pictures  of the Italian hill cities and Renaissance Florence.	1999-06-29
