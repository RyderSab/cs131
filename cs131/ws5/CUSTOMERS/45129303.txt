That is exactly what it is. For all of us to take a few minutes and understand how the small towns work. Why some of us are here and how the towns are changing and wondering what will become of them. I for one think someday they will be a thing of the past but, I hope that as in Dale's eyes just maybe it is the time of the white buffalo. I highly recommend this book to all who question life. I am so glad to finally know what happened to the night man. May his soul rest in peace.	2005-10-03

Micaela takes your hand from the first page and with every word there after, you both want to devour this book and savor each word all at the same time. The story of Mary, a rather spoiled southern belle who is rapidly in danger of becoming a spinster, and Henry, a general who at 40 has decided he wants her for his bride becomes a truly breathtaking tale. Mary weds Henry and he takes her to the western frontier. The book tells the story of Mary becoming a woman and learning to love this stranger who is her husband. It is also the story of the beginning of the end of the indians who are also a mystery to Mary, especially her husbands relationship with Black Hawk and a female indian translator. For Mary to truly understand herself, her husband and his relationship with these two indians is the making of a truly great novel. One that after even 400 pages seems to end too quickly.

I started Ava's Man yesterday afternoon and didn't stop till I was finished. With the story of his mother in Shoutin I learned how it was to grow up in the south with his mother, 3 brothers and an alcoholic father who was never around. I wondered at the time where his mother got her backbone from and in Ava's Man I found out. His maternal grandfather, Charles Bundrum, was a true man of the south. He raised 7 children during the depression with little or no money and he raised them all solid. He had to move his family 21 times to keep one step ahead of poverty. He worked where ever there was work and he made moonshine. He lived his life as a man and loved his family. Charles could have been an angry man but , he wasn't. He was a legend in his own time and I am so glad that Mr Bragg took the time to tell his story.

But this is really the story of Liddy's twin Tessa who thinks she sees the future in glass. This is a quick ride thru the summer of the twin's 18th year. It is fast paced and you are along for the ride to the very end. Even tho the future has been forseen doesn't mean that it is fact. Sit down, relax with this book and you won't be able to put it down till the end.	2001-07-13

Once again Evanovich has taken a day out of my life and made it a good one. Stephanie is up to her usual in the newest book in her series. All of my favorite people were there too. From Lulu to Mooner. I laughed out loud many times and shake my head at the fix this girl always seems to get into with her automobile. Ranger and Morelli, two men who I think could sit on my doorstep anytime. Ranger is just too smooth for words. Once again the ending is cut short but, I will just have to wait another year to see what really happened. The only thing that disappoints me is that a year is way too long to have to wait to be with these people again. Eight is a date that I can't wait to happen!	2001-06-23

It is a story about a true friendship between Kevin and Phiz. It is about all the trials and tribulations that goes with a friendship. This is a book I started and couldn't put down till the end. I felt a kinship with these two because of the time setting of the book. The book caught me up in the beginning and kept a hold of me for the whole ride until the end. I can't wait for the next book by this author.	2001-06-23

This is an insightful book into a year in the life of a woman having to discover who she is. She makes the decision to take a year off and goes to a cottage by the sea. I relished each page in this book. From the dolphins, to the seals, to her working at the fish market until the end when she really finds herself. I only wish that I could take a year by the sea. All woman should read this book. Old and young will see something of theselves in this great book.	2001-06-07

It is the first of his books I have read and will now have to go back and read the others. Having lived in a small town for the last 11yrs I could relate to the tale he told about dreams lost, lost souls and just trying to get along. Each character has his own search for what went wrong and how to try and get it right. I rooted for Miles to speak-up! The characters became a part of my life for a short time and it was a very enjoyable ride.	2001-06-05
