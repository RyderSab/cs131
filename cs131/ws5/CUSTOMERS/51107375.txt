In looking at 11 different Psalms the author calls believers to abandon the shallowness that passes for much of American Christianity for a deeper walk in &quot;unselfing&quot; ourselves to impact us personally, families, churches, society and our world in general...moving from self-centeredness to community. Excellent and cannot recommend highly enough. Matthew 6:21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.	2004-06-11

I actually have the Cambridge UK published edition of the RSV [the UK edition is single column format and is brown leather with 'Harper's Study Notes' in it] and it has become a much needed friend in my studies. Cambridge has the highest quality standards and this is no exception. Clear type face, quality paper and durable binding, I especially like the single column format, plus the type style which is very eye-pleasing. Out of the  57  Bibles I own and use all the time, this one and the Cambridge Wide Margin KJV are my favorites. Also, for my more conservative Christian friends, just remember if any fundamentalist tries to tell you the RSV destroys the doctrine of the virgin birth of our Lord because it translates Isaiah 7:14 'a young woman' shall give birth to Messiah instead of 'a virgin shall conceive' tell them to look in Matthew 1 in the RSV where it clearly says 'a virgin'...just remember in Isaiah's day and time [unlike nowadays] every young woman [12-18] was a virgin, plus the Sept. clears all that stuff up too. The RSV retain majestic language when speaking of Yahweh and it also reads very lyrically in the poetic sections.<br />Unlike many sterile 'modern' translations overflooding the market this overlooked gem deserves your time and effort.	2003-07-17

Hope it will FINALLY bring some jobs that pay something here after years and years of him as governor and raising taxes and years as president we really need some relief down here, hope we can recover because our state really DOES have some noble, industrious, intelligent people in it. I know a therapist who says he displays all the signs of a classic sex addict, well I don't know about that but Patterson's book only confirms what we knew all along down here in Arkansas, but it is a great read. It is no secret the military suffered, but so did all the tax-payers because liberal socialism just doesn't work. You can't try sociological experiments on military personnel and you can't use citizens that work hard for next to nothing to support a growing welfare state. Ask around in Arkansas and folks will tell you [we learned the hard way when he was governor]-plus look around in Arkansas and you'll be hard-pressed to find intelligent people that voted for him.<br />Patterson touches on these facts and we must remember Clinton took office after years of progressive groundwork to get government OUT of our lives, have a strong military, not let the NEA ruin our children and not let the Unions price American workers out of their much needed jobs by insisting on sky-high wages, and immediately kow-towed to those groups that clearly have torn America down. And don't forget NAFTA.	2003-03-27

I read it in 4 days and re-reading it right now. My 'punk-rock influenced' son read it with eye-opening results.<br />As a Protestant exploring and gradually accepting Eastern Orthodoxy this was an excellent book. The first pages and the tile may depress you but there is nothing depressing about the book in that the authors give us the angle of view we need in our post-modern, materialistic world--the angle of view that shows us the joyful, refreshing, mind-boggling LIGHT of the World, Christ Himself in everlasting splendor lived through the lives of those who gave their life for Him. Highly recommended.<br />Postscript: Marler returned to the punk-world from monasticism but his points are right on target and his 'after-monk' life still shines through with the everlasting Light.<br />The argument presented and the answer given do not discount his return to 'punk-world' --- in fact it just increases it's justification...read his post-monk interview available online, just type in his name or punks-to-monks in your browser...<br />Excellent book!	2002-10-23

Books	5	7	11	N	N	Should be required reading for W.A.S.P.'s like me	When we look way way back into Christian history we usually look to the mid-east and the missionary journeys of Paul into Turkey and Greece, etc. BUT few realize the mighty missionary work in Africa the first 10-15 years after Christ's resurrection. Usry and Keener give us an eye-opening look at the fact that Christianity was established in Africa [Egypt and Ethiopia] and spread like wildfire throughout North and East Africa-in fact Christianity became better entrenched, more united, less 'tainted' and more enduring quicker than when it spread northward and they show us Christianity MOST definitely should be considered Afro-centric. The first 3 chapters are worth the price of the book. I wish EVERY white preacher [like me] would read this. Keener [a white preacher in a mainly black denomination] is the author of several thorough and gifted volumes on marriage, the Holy Spirit and the Gospel of Matthew [published by IVP] and he brings his thoroughness here as well.<br />Usry's [and Kenner's] testimonies are great!Their historical documentation is great and their line of thought in refuting black Muslim's arguments that Christianity enslaved and brought down black Africa is absolutely stunning. Islam didn't even exist until well after Christianity and was forced upon the people at sword-point. Black Man's Religion is superb, I highly recommend it for an eye-opening thought-provoking read-especially for Southern W.A.S.P.s like me. Also read anything by Albert Raboteau [about African-American religious experience] and the fascinating story of Coptic [African/Egyptian] Christianity. More and more and more it is very clear that Christianity is so ORIENTAL [i.e. of the mid-east, southwest Asia and North/East Africa]-American Christianity is still in its infancy in comparison.	2002-05-15

Using missles to plow ground for increased food production will be the 'new technological' breakthrough we've been needing. Acres of wasteland will be transformed into rich agricultural land.

It is his frank, open story of his 'awakening' as a person loved by God, with once blind eyes, so much like all of us, who once thought 'doing' equals 'being' but who solidly met the mysterious true God of grace in learning that to 'be' and not to 'do' is the most important thing you can do in this thing called living. The 'rat-race' of modern American 'Christian ministry' has sapped and zapped many of us, but, unlike most modern Christian ministry 'experts'...to be somebody does NOT mean competing and achieving. It means letting God work through, flow in, flow out of and bless you--then you bless others--pressing on and passing on His Light and Love. As he says in the book, &quot;The challenge is to become aware of what is already inside by grace...and to learn to bring that fullness out through generous and sacrificial service to the whole of creation.&quot; I hope someone reprints this excellent book and gives it a wider audience. Also, along these same lines, read Eugene H. Peterson's excellent 'The Contemplative Pastor.'	2001-01-13

Leads you into a largely 'uncharted territory' for mainstream 20th [oops 21st] Century American Christians--that great well of deep Christian theologians and thinkers of the mid 1600s to early 1800s. Preacher/Theologian/Writers like Edwards and Whitefield and Milton and others are great food for hungry postmodern pilgrims. I think McDermott lays good groundwork of which another good 20th Century Christian Preacher/Theologian/Writer has built upon and popularized even more, that is John Piper, who has really brought Jonathan Edwards to the forefront and Piper's writings are highly recommended as well as Dallas Willard. McDermott's book lead you to that place, as Piper calls it, of 'Being Delighted in God' as Dallas Willard puts it in his book 'Divine Conspiracy' &quot;Knowing Jesus as an essential part of the here and now.&quot; In other words 'Seeing God' helps us to become people who are God-centered, God-treasuring, God-filled, God-honoring, God-glorifying with wholehearted, whole soul commitment. 'Seeing God' is a refreshing, introspective and challenging read. Get it and you won't be disappointed.	2000-12-26

Job is a 'true classic' in that everybody can relate to the narrative of  Job. Mason does an EXCELLENT job of [and according to his forward, he's  learned from personal experience] devotionally and practically opening up  the eternal issues of doubt, suffering, faith and the human experience.  Although it is not meant to be a scholarly commentary, Mason does better  than most 'scholarly' commentators with the questions and answers we find  in the Biblical narrative of Job. Everybody shares the things Job went  through, the important thing is to see that Job [as Mason brings out  extremely well] was moved TOWARD God, not away from God in Job's trials and  sufferings. As Mason says people reject Jesus but no one rejects Job. And  as Job found out you can't reject the Redeemer! Mason's 'Gospel According  to Job' is VERY worthwhile reading for pastors, Bible students and any  believer seeking a deeper walk with the Lord. With so much PLASTIC  Christianity out there, it is great to find some depth. Recommended highly  for anyone who faces LIFE. Another largely unknown excellent work on Job is  'Portraits of Perseverance' by Henry Gariepy [Victor Books, 1989]--I don't  know if you can find it anywhere but Gariepy [a Salvation Army pastor] does  an excellent job of commenting on the Book of Job in short devotional  statements, showing Job as a man [like all of us] moved TOWARD God through  pain, suffering and trials.	2000-09-13

Roxburgh's analogy and observations of a local coffee shop/organic  grocery always packed with postmoderns, hits the nail right on the head and  then his applying the principles of those stores without compromising the  ministry is great.

Here is the tool to reach  postmodern America. RELATIONAL, REAL ministry to heart, soul, mind and body  that will make the lost look up to Christ. Great examples given by Hunter  in the 'conquest' of a pagan Ireland and the early [pre-Catholic,  pre-Anglican] Celtic churches role in it. The great missing portion of REAL  care, community and concern in 1940-70s gluttonous American Christianity  and the woeful emphasis on doctrine and making mtns. out of mole-hills in  1940-70s American Theology are clearly seen as our downfall in reaching the  West. Western Christianity can only be improved in looking back at THEN  putting into ACTION the great themes of Celtic Christianity and Hunter's  book does a quick, good, well-written job at laying the groundwork. Read  with wonder and read in tandem with Robert C. Webber's 'Ancient-Future  Faith' and let the Lord of lords lead you.	2000-08-09

Ha!] are all cramming down Western  Christianity's throat that we've got to have 'contemporary music'  [so-called] and we've got to have this and that to 'reach' our postmodern  world. Webber hits the nail right on the head and brings out the  grass-roots issue many of us 'small-time' small town, small church, 'in the  trenches' pastors have known over the last 10 years of ministry, namely  that all the fads and all the hoopla, all the 'church growth' ideas will  NOT get people into church. God's way and God's Word and God's worship is  the ONLY way. Returning to our 'roots' is EXACTLY what attracts folks to  the place I minister in. Webber's form of Ancient-Future Worship does what  spiritually hungry people WANT...EXALTING Christ, EXPERIENCING  Christ...ENCOURAGING participation in Christ. I highly recommend this, even  though it is sometimes a little too 'high-brow' and I'd highly recommend  Hunter's 'Celtic Way of Evangelism' in tandam to get THE RIGHT picture of  worship and ministry that WILL reach Generation X, Generation Y and all the  others in this rapidly changing world. People want solidarity and long for  relationships and right tradition. Webber's book shows us how to do that  through the greatest exercise man is privileged to participate  in...worshiping the Triune God! Missions exists because worship  doesn't...think about it.	2000-08-09

Job was a person like us and all  of us can see a little bit of Job in us. Chambers masterfully brings out  the fact that suffering IS NOT the curse of God or because we have  committed wrongs. Job is shown to be moving CLOSER to God in his  tribulation rather than further from God [which some modern commentaries  do]--suffering, trials and problems ARE a part of human existence and  better is the person who will see God ABOVE it as they must travel through  it.<br />Baffled to Fight Better is EXACTLY what postmoderns need to lessen  the anger against God when rough times come.

The NRSV is beautiful, the binding is sturdy, the type style is superb...I only wish Cambridge made this in a genuine leather binding. For college and/or seminary students this would be a great addition to your study library and you can have plenty of room for note taking. It would be a nicer looking hardback if it wasn't that mustard yellow color, but it's okay. Try it you'll like it. Cambridge NRSV wide margin is an excellent Bible, you will not be disappointed.

Excellent commentary in a non-commentary style as he says  about the treasure of the Kingdom Jesus posits in parables, &quot;as  children turned loose in the treasure room of the castle--we've got more  than enough to keep us fascinated forever.&quot; Capon's insights are  astounding and will shake up 'modern plastic Christianity's' conventional  ideas. I think Capon grasps Jesus' teaching/preaching method of inductive  preaching/teaching better than anyone else. His other books are fantastic  too. A worthy read, first of three about the parables. Read all three then  buy 'The Mystery of Christ.' Capon is an Episcopal priest and a chef and he  sure puts together some fine dishes!	2000-04-22

Series)	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Promises More Than Delivers	I expected to have a good view of USA armor troops, but alas...too much fluff not enough depth. To me WW2 was not covered well and the Vietnam era not well enough. Maybe I was expecting much too much from 108 pages, and I  reckon the color photos they tell you about are only the cover photos. I  guess this book is like a M-4 Sherman--promised more than it delivered.	2000-04-22

If you are a pastor, thinking of going in to the ministry, seminary student etc. BUY THIS BOOK! Peterson's insights are just exactly what I needed someone to tell me 15 years ago when I entered the ministry. This is  part of three or four books Peterson has written for pastors and if they  have only half of the depth of this one they are all super. Peterson's  books to pastors all have cumbersome titles but buy 'em, they're great.  Worthy reading! The others are: 'Five Smooth Stones for Pastoral Work'  'Under the Unpredictable Plant' 'Working the Angles' Check this great  pastor's pastor out. You will not be disappointed!	2000-04-22

The Book of Common  Prayer is one of the greatest devotional classics ever and an excellent  framework for daily enriching and deepening one's walk with Christ. Liturgy  edifies and uplifts and if you are a Baptist or any other evangelical label  and you are in search of depth, read and enjoy Webber's book. I'd recommend  his new book too 'Ancient-Future Faith' and his 'Liturgical Evangelism.'  All the harping against Anglicanism/Episcopalians by my contemporaries has  proven false. IF you are interested in returning to the true worship of our  forefathers go and see for yourself in a Anglican/Episcopal church and  devour'Evangelicals on the Canterbury Trail'	2000-04-15
