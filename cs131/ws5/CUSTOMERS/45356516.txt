Never mind that the artwork resembled the artwork of &#147;Batman: The Animated Series&#148;. Never mind the fact that the show featured a giant robot that ended up fighting a giant monster or robot at the end of each episode. With its surprisingly fresh twist on the robot genre, likable characters, and noir-like flair, &#147;The Big O&#148; grew into such a popular series that Cartoon Network personally funded a second season to continue from where the show left off with its cliffhanger ending. Now Viz brings the graphic novel adaptation of the series to America, and while quite different in style from the anime, the manga manages to hold out on its own.<br />&#147;The Big O&#148; manga actually starts with a couple of prologues to the anime series, meaning our hero Roger Smith and his trusty robot Big O have a couple adventures before they begin the story found in the anime. These two stories actually work very well, giving depth to some familiar characters as well as breathing life into all-new ones. The third story is where we step into familiar territory, retelling episode one of the anime in manga format.<br />What sets the manga apart from the anime series is that the manga has more of an anime style the series. Because the series looks and feels much like &#147;Batman: TAS&#148;, it&#146;s somewhat surprising to see the manga not follow suit. Still, that doesn&#146;t mean the manga doesn&#146;t retain the anime&#146;s appeal. With a style reminiscent of the works of Frank Miller, the artwork of the manga brings the gothic finesse of &#147;The Big O&#148; to life on paper while at the same time setting it apart from its anime counterpart.<br />Overall, there&#146;s pretty much nothing wrong with &#147;The Big O&#148; manga. It&#146;ll definitely take a couple more volumes to see how the manga handles the series itself, but so far things are looking promising. If you are a fan of the anime series, I recommend looking into this manga; it just may hold you over until the second season of &#147;The Big O&#148; premiers on Cartoon Network&#146;s Adult Swim block.	2002-11-10
US	45356516	RYLOT6685TBAO	1931514429	689744879	Dragon Knights, Vol. 3	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A great third volume with a balance of menace and comedy.	The first volume of &#147;Dragon Knights&#148; introduced us to the powerful yet amusingly dense Dragon Knights in the tradition of &#147;Slayers&#148;, with oddball humor and witty sarcasm. The second volume took a different and darker turn with the story while allowing the comedy to take a well-deserved rest with an occasional appearance. The third volume of the series draws on the strengths of these two volumes and finds a well-executed balance between the series&#146; lightheartedness and sense of menace.<br />With volume three, the battle for Nadil&#146;s head is growing ever closer, but the Dragon Knights first have to face the troubles from within their own protected fortress. A yokai (full demon) has somehow manages to penetrate the fortress&#146; protective barrier. The fortune teller Cesia, who herself is a yokai protected by Lord Lykouleon&#146;s magic, is facing growing tension as a yokai working for the Dragon Lords. And deep below the castle, a magic of deception hides a mystery that no one can yet explain fully. All this while, the Dragon Knights try to satisfy their own desires (namely eating, killings demons, etc.).<br />Like volume two, the tone of volume three is a lot darker than the tone of volume one. For example, a side story that was hilarious in volume one takes a dark turn in volume three with some sinister imagery and haunting dialogue. In fact the change in atmosphere is so unexpected that readers might wonder whether the first volume was an accident. Still, despite the dark mood of volume three, there is still some funny and quirky lines to be found; it&#146;s not in every manga series that a character comments about another character being absent for an entire manga chapter. And surprisingly, the balance between the dark and flippant tone is executed very well, almost to the point where the reader doesn&#146;t really care what previous volumes were like. And with the story beginning to develop, &#147;Dragon Knights&#148; will make surethat reader stick around for future volumes to come.<br />Overall, &#147;Dragon Knights&#148; is definitely one of those more obscure series that manga fans will want to check out. &#147;Slayers&#148; fans will definitely want to look into this series, although with the witty humor no longer the center of focus they shouldn&#146;t hold expectations for a series too reminiscent of &#147;Slayers&#148;. Either way, &#147;Dragon Knights&#148; shouldn&#146;t be missed.	2002-11-10
US	45356516	R2ESYJX4YJY83H	1931514410	627543899	Dragon Knights, Vol. 2	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A darker yet enthralling volume of a great series.	With the first volume, \\"Dragon Knights\\" surprised us with a relatively intelligent comedy in a fantasy world. While it may be comparable to the king of this genre, the almighty \\"Slayers\\", \\"Dragon Knights\\" manages to distinguish itself from other series with its unique characters and simple yet engaging story. Volume one introduced these characters and the quest they set out to carry out. With volume two, we get some back story that adds a great amount of depth to the overall series.<br />The quest of the three Dragon Knights - Rath, who's obsessed with slaughtering demons; Thatz, who has a strong desire for cash; and Rune, who just wants to get home - was to find the head of Nadil, the enemy of Lord Lykouleon, and bring it back to the Lord. While the first volume showed the Dragon Knights' adventures in trying to get the head home, the second volume deals with the history of Nadil and Lord Lykouleon, as well as how the Dragon Knights came into being.<br />Taken as a whole, the tone of volume two is a lot darker than volume one. Whereas volume one was filled with comical punch lines and witty situations, volume two touches on a serious subject within the overall story. There is humor found in the volume, particularly when the Dragon Knights are present, but when things get serious, it gets serious. But thankfully, everything manages to work out. The dark tone adds a lot to the story and the touches of comedy balances the volume out very well. It'll be interesting to see how volume three will play out, but since the series has so far proven it can be both funny and serious, it shouldn't matter in which direction the series heads.<br />Overall, volume two is a wonderful continuation of \\"Dragon Knights\\", making the series an enjoyable read. And because it's in its original right-to-left format, it can be enjoyed the way it was meant to be enjoyed. I cannot recommend this series enough to fans of comical fantasy, but anyone looking for a quick laugh or an engaging storyshould also give \\"Dragon Knights\\" a chance.	2002-10-13
US	45356516	REI5PTB5C0HL4	193151464X	23289711	Planet Ladder, Vol. 3	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A great third volume in a surprisingly entertaining series.	The first two volumes of \\"Planet Ladder\\" have been a pleasant surprise. With an intriguing story pushed along by some very well-conceived characters, this manga is a wonderful delight for anyone who has decided to try this relatively unknown series in TOKYOPOP's new \\"100% Authentic Manga\\" line. Can the third volume of \\"Planet Ladder\\" keep us entertained and live up to the first two volumes? Thankfully, yes.<br />Kaguya, the high school girl who has been transported to another world, now knows her destiny and the terrible choice she has to end up making. Now on the run with a woman she for some reason greatly admires and a living doll who obeys her every command, Kaguya eventually runs into, of all things, a giant talking chicken with a bizarre yet sad story and a surprising secret.<br />The main story of \\"Planet Ladder\\" somewhat takes a backseat in this third volume to make room for the story told by the giant talking chicken. This can be seen as dragging things out, but the way the story is told begs to differ. The story fits perfectly into the overall arc of \\"Planet Ladder\\", and there are even subtle hints that bits and pieces of the story will factor into the series in later volumes. And near the end the main story does get back on track, ending with a subtle yet effective cliffhanger that'll leave readers waiting agitatedly for volume four.<br />With the story set to move forward and spring all sorts of surprises, I can't recommend \\"Planet Ladder\\" enough. Fantasy fans will love the story's delicate and dark tone, and by the looks of things romance fans will soon get their fill later in the series. And thanks to TOKYOPOP, the manga can be read in its original right-to-left format, making it a very worthwhile buy indeed.	2002-10-13

While it definately has its charm, it isn't well known enough to make itself known among other TOKYOPOP titles such as &quot;Love Hina&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, and &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;. Which is a pity, because while the first volume demonstrated a lot of potential, volume two develops that potential into a wonderful story.<br />The beauty of &quot;Planet Ladder&quot; can be seen in the front cover, which is a beautiful yet haunting picture of the main character, Kaguya. The wonderful artwork remains throughout the rest of the graphic novel, some of which is enough to rival CLAMP.<br />With the stunny artwork comes a marvelously constructed story that goes much deeper than the first volume. Kaguya, trapped within another &quot;world,&quot; must find out who she is and what her destiny is, and what she discovers is nothing short of one of the worst burdens someone could ever hope to never carry. While the story in the second volume probably doesn't move along as much as the first one, the story is still good enough to give the reader something to look forward to when volume three is published.<br />As stated before, the artork in &quot;Planet Ladder&quot; is enough to rival CLAMP's style in many ways. And thanks to the &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot; line, the novel is published in its original right-to-left format. Because of this, the artwork isn't left distorted by photo-reversing effects and remains crisp and clear for US readers to enjoy.<br />As for the translation, TOKYOPOP's infamous reputation as a mediocore translator is being left in the dust. The dialogue sounds natural and realistic, not stiff and flat like in series such as &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; To top it off, TOKYOPOP also left the original sound effects in the novel translated. However, with this second volume, TOKYOPOP experimentally put in miniature translations within the untranslated kana sound effects. This experiment actually succeeds, as it leaves the original effects in and translates them without ruining them.<br />All in all, the second volume of &quot;Planet Ladder&quot; is a worthy continuation of the wonderful first volume. While the series will most likely never reach the status of series like &quot;Inu-Yasha&quot; and &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;, anyone lucky enough to come across this series will be glad they picked it up.	2002-07-15

Manga and anime, while originating from the same country, are two very distinct mediums. While anime has to condense or even omit a lot of information to make something watchable for a large audience, manga has the opportunity to explore ideas better and develop characters further. Such is the case with &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, which is considered a classic in both anime and manga formats. But while the anime does have its moments, it's the manga that truly shines.<br />For anyone who has seen the anime first, the manga of &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; will present quite a surprise. The story in the manga is a lot more developed and complex, and characters are more fleshed-out. While action prevailed in the anime, the manga decides to flesh the world out more and explore the ideas of what it means to be human more indepth. The manga also has somewhat of a comical tone, something the anime didn't have. The heroine of the story, Major Motoko Kusanagi, like every character in the story, is also very different from her anime counterpart. Instead of a dead-serious, almost cold woman, Kusanagi is the kind of woman found in other Masamune Shirow manga like &quot;Dominion: Tank Police&quot; and &quot;Appleseed&quot;: serious when need be, short-tempered when pushed, and happy-go-lucky on occasion. In fact, the differences between the anime and manga can be summed up as the difference between &quot;bare-minimum&quot; and &quot;total depth&quot;.<br />Visually, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; is not the best-looking manga on today's market, but it does have its own unique style. If you're reading this manga expecting the realistic character models and world of the anime, you'll be disappointed. Masamune Shirow's drawing style has barely evolved from his days of &quot;Appleseed&quot;, and &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; maintains that style. Characters can either be detailed figures or chibi-like outlines, depending upon whether the comic takes a humorous or serious turn. Depending on your tastes, it might or might not be a turn-off. But anyone who enjoys or tolerates so-called &quot;classic&quot; style of drawing such as &quot;Astro Boy&quot; and &quot;Akira&quot; won't have much trouble getting into &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;.<br />Regarding the translation, Dark Horse Comics does one of the better jobs in the market today. There are no typos to be found, and the dialogue isn't static or flat. They even translated several notes made in the margins of the actual comic by Masamune Shirow.<br />Overall, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; is an outstanding read for any serious manga fan. The story is more complex than the one found in the anime and by far a much better one. The artistic style might turn off people who aren't big fans of manga, but it shouldn't really be that much of a problem. Don't pass this story up; it deserves a place in any manga reader's collection!	2002-05-29
US	45356516	R353TAFRPSTXHZ	0451450523	22804953	The Last Unicorn	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A classic piece of fantasy literature and excellent story.	In the genre of fantasy, there are few books that can be considered \\"classics,\\" as it's very difficult to create a classic and universally-loved story set within a fantasy world. Members of this elite club include \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" by J.R.R. Tolkein, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" by Lewis Caroll, and \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" by C.S. Lewis. Peter S. Beagle also joins this membership with his classic \\"The Last Unicorn\\", a beautfully crafted and utterly wonderful story.<br />The story deals with a unicorn who discovers she is the last of her kind. She sets out to find her missing race, but ends up with more than she bargains for. With the help of a bumbling magician and a maid, she must face an evil king who uses a mysterious creature for a purpose not even she could imagine.<br />The story is perhaps one of the most beautifully crafted stories in all of fantasy. It is far from being an epic - it's more of a short story that happens to be long - but it still makes for a captivating read. And the story doesn't always take itself seriously; there's a kind of wry humor that might be found in a Disney-like cartoon. However, \\"The Last Unicorn\\" is far from a Disney-esque book. There is a subtle yet undeniable dark tone in the story, and the characters have real personalities and character development, with flaws and irregularities. In the span of a relatively short novel, Beagle's world is realized with such amazing beauty and skill it's difficult not to be engrossed in his simple yet elegant prose.<br />Although it's most likely out of print by now, I seriously reccommend finding this book. If \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is the Bible of fantasy, then \\"The Last Unicorn\\" is the equivalent of a book written by Max Lucado. It's suitable for all ages, and it beats the movie by a long shot. You will laugh, you will cry, you will feel satisfied. \\"The Last Unicorn\\" is one of fantasy's unquestionable classics.	2002-05-27

The second in the first Uplift trilogy, \\"Startide Rising\\" is an immense improvement over the first book in the series, \\"Sundiver\\". While overall not terribe, \\"Sundiver\\" was only an above-average story set in an incredible universe, and these two factors didn't mix all that well. With \\"Staride Rising\\", David Brin takes a wonderful story and places it in that fantastic universe, creating a wonderful science-fiction novel that's only hurt by its own complexity.<br />Unlike \\"Sundiver\\", which dealt with more of a murder mystery than anything, \\"Startide Rising\\" deals with the key factor that binds the trilogy together: Uplifting. The story mentions the possibility of the Patron race of humans, the legendary race that seeded all races in existence, and how a crew of humans and uplifted dolphins are protecting a vital secret from all the hostile races of the galaxy, just to name a few ideas.<br />David Brin's imagination is unbelievable. It's hard to think how he managed to create such a magnificent world without selling his soul or something. Things in the novel seem so \\"futuristic\\" and \\"sci-fi,\\" and yet we believe them without question. Brin manages to flesh out a world so perfectly we can imagine it, live it, and sympathize with it. Every alien, every technological machine, and every idea has some substance in it.<br />Probably the only problem involves the story itself. While one of the best stories I've ever read in science-fiction, it has one tragic flaw: it's too complex. The story is overloaded with so many characters and so many plot twists that it can be difficult to keep up with everything. Readers will sometimes wonder why something is going on or who this person is, which can get a little frustrating. Thankfully, the story is so engrossing it keeps the readers interested and allows them to catch up to things on their own time.<br />All in all, \\"Startide Rising\\" is a marvelous science-fiction story that's only hindered by its own complex story. The ending sets up the third novel in the trilogy perfectly, although it does leave some questions unanswered in the story. Will the third novel answer them? We can only read \\"The Uplift War\\" and see...	2002-05-22

After giving us the excellent volumes 1 and 2, &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; and &quot;Tears of an Angel&quot;, Yukito Kishiro gave us what many consider the worst volume in the series, &quot;Killing Angel&quot;. Volume 3 dealt with Alita's new life after the tragic events of volume 2, and while it wasn't a complete blashemy against the series, the storytelling quality didn't live up to the first two volumes. With volume 4, &quot;Angel of Victory&quot;, Kishiro improves upon &quot;Killing Angel&quot;, but considering what he worked with, the storytelling quality still wasn't where it should've been.<br />&quot;Angel of Victory&quot; is actually a continuation of &quot;Killing Angel&quot;, a continuation meaing that the two volumes can be seen as parts of each other. The story deals with Alita trying to prove herself the best motorball champion while coming to terms with the sudden changes in her life. By now, her character is very well fleshed out and we really do care for her in many ways. However, the story in &quot;Angel of Victory&quot; still deals with motorball, something that doesn't have anything to do with Alita trying to discover her lost past, the reason we fell in love with her in the first place. The story in &quot;Angel of Victory&quot; is far better than the one in &quot;Killing Angel&quot;, as it has several well-planned events and even a brief glimpse of Alita's past. But as a whole, the story isn't want we expected from the &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; series. If volumes 3 and 4 had been placed together into one volume, they might've been seen in a better light, but as it stands the two volumes are nothing compared to the first two volumes.<br />Graphically, Yukito Kishiro's artwork is amazing. There is so much detail that some artwork appears like it's come straight from a photo. If it had to be compared to something, Kishiro's artwork would resembled a polished version of Hayao Miyazaki's &quot;Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind&quot; series, andeven then the comparison is unfair.<br />All in all, &quot;Angel of Victory&quot; is far better than &quot;Killing Angel&quot;, but it's not the best in the series. Still, &quot;Angel of Victory&quot; does set up some small plot details later on in the series, so it's not completely useless. If read with the entire series on hand, &quot;Angel of Victory&quot; (and &quot;Killing Angel&quot;, for that matter) will be more appreciated. But alone, volume 4 doesn't live up to the first to excellent volumes in Kishiro's wonderful series.	2002-04-28
US	45356516	R6KP9LJYNLFNW	1931514402	689744879	Dragon Knights #1	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A incredibly humorous and highly amusing series.	With TOKYOPOP's new \\"100% Authentic Manga\\" line, the company attempts to wipe away the mistakes they made with previous manga series (\\"Sailor Moon\\", \\"Cardcaptor Sakura\\", etc.) while at the same time giving the reader an \\"authentic\\" reading experience. The results so far have been nothing short of amazing, as brand new series are given a much higher scope of their potential. This quality extends into \\"Dragon Knights\\", a highly amusing series that benefits from TOKYOPOP's new format and showcases a humorous and entertaining story.<br />\\"Dragon Knights\\" tells the story of Rune, Rath, and Thatz, three Dragon Knights that must deliver the head of a man named Nadil to the Dragon Lord Lykouleon. But this isn't easy, as the three characters have very conflicting plans: Rune just wants to get the head to the capital, Rath just wants to fight demons, and Thatz just wants to get money. Add in the mix a bunch of oddball characters after the head for their own ends, and the story takes a series of bizarre twists.<br />The front cover of the volume makes it look serious, but the story is far from that. If you've ever seen \\"Slayers\\", then you'll know what to expect: complete zaniness. In what other manga does a soccer ball appear in a magical world? In what other manga does a bad guy threaten to banish a good guy from the comic? But the plot isn't shallow, either; beneath all the craziness in the first volume is a deep story that'll most likely be fleshed out in later volumes (all 16 of them). The first volume is very entertaining, and it gives a reader a lot to look forward to in the next installment.<br />Visually, \\"Dragon Knights\\" isn't the best-looking manga on the market. However, the style really suits the series' oddball humor and characters; it'd be difficult to imagine the series looking any other way. If you had to compare it to something, I'd say it looks like the artwork of \\"Sailor Moon\\", only a LOT more polished and refined (and that might not even be a good comparison). Also, with TOKYOPOP's \\"100% Authentic Manga\\" format, the artwork is presented in it's original right-to-left format, leaving it untouched by photo-reversing affects and therefore leaving it clean and crisp.<br />Regarding the translation, TOKYOPOP is indeed getting better. Previous efforts like \\"Cardcaptor Sakura\\" and \\"Gundam Wing\\" sounded stale and emotionless, but the translation of \\"Dragon Knights\\" is actually good. I counted one spelling error, but it's really nothing to get worked up about. And the overall dialogue is very convincing and emotional, thanks to the fact the text appears handwritten and not typed.<br />Overall, \\"Dragon Warriors\\" is a great series that shows a lot of potential and will most likely live up to that potential. While it's not the best manga series out there, it's worth any serious manga reader's time to look into it, and fans of \\"Slayers\\" and other similar anime/manga should definately give this a try.	2002-04-28

It has a devout following of fans who enjoy the company's releases of manga based off popular anime shows such as &quot;Gundam Wing&quot;, &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot;, and &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, but it's also despised by people who feel TOKYOPOP butchers many great manga titles with mediocre translations and distortion of the original artwork. But TOKYOPOP decided to change the opinions of the latter group of people with its new &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot; policy, and one of the titles selected for this new line-up is &quot;Planet Ladder&quot;, a relatively unknown series in the US. This is actually a shame, because while not many people have heard of &quot;Planet Ladder&quot;, it shows the promise of a teriffic manga series that is a breath of fresh air in today's manga market.<br />&quot;Planet Ladder&quot; tells the story of Kaguya, a girl who was found orphaned at a young age with no memories of her past except for a chilling vision concerning her and a nameless young boy. She tries to blend in with her new life and family, but her low self-esteem hinders her from feeling at all useful. Her life starts to fall apart when her father is charged with bribery, but things really start to get out of hand when mysterious beings appear before her, apparently wanting her for some obscure reason. While some of the normal conventions of anime and manga are still found in &quot;Planet Ladder&quot;, the story as a whole is refreshing and unique. It can sometimes be difficult to understand what's going on, but the reader afterwards quickly understands and the story overall flows smoothly and cleanly.<br />Visually, the artwork is undeniably &quot;shojo,&quot; girls-style. Characters are drawn seriously with a lot of detail in several frames, and then switch to a chibi-like form with the usual sweat drops and tear marks and such. It can feel a little unbalanced at times, especially if the reader wishes to know what kind of style the artist plans to utilize mainly in the series. But for the most part, the artwork is amazing and showcases some extraordinary talent. And thanks to TOKYOPOP's new &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot; policy, we US readers can see that artwork as it was originally intended. Unlike the majority of English-translated manga, &quot;Planet Ladder&quot; reads from right-to-left, leaving the artwork crisp and clean and untouched by photoreversing methods that can distort or blur it (&quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; is an unfortunate victim of such methods).<br />In regards to the translation, I can honestly say that TOKYOPOP is getting better. While other of the company's manga like &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; used a horrible text that looked like computer type, &quot;Planet Ladder&quot; uses text that appears more handdrawn, giving it the intended &quot;authentic&quot; feel. And the translation is actually pretty good; it doesn't feel static or bland and actually expresses emotion. There weren't even any typos, something TOKYOPOP is infamous for.<br />All in all, &quot;Planet Ladder&quot; is a worthy addition to any manga fan's collection. While it is a little early to tell how well the story will develop, the first volume is good enough that readers can expect quite a bit from the second volume.  While not in the same league as the manga-greats such as &quot;Inu-Yasha&quot;, &quot;Fushigi Yugi&quot;, and &quot;Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind&quot;, &quot;Planet Ladder&quot; is an entertaining series that should delight any manga fan. And thanks to TOKYOPOP's new &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot; policy, we can enjoy the way it was meant to be enjoyed.	2002-04-24

Its plots are original and action-packed, its dub has been called one of the best ever done, and its characters are some of the most beloved characters in the anime community. So it's no surprise that TOKYOPOP decided to bring the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; manga to the States. Using TOKYOPOP's new &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot; format, the manga is a set of stories told within the universe of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; before the final set of episodes. Sadly, the manga is nothing compared to the anime masterpiece; even so, fans of the series and fans of manga in general owe it to themselves to give this manga a look at least.<br />The anime series follows an episode-like format for the most of its 26-episode run (meaning episodes don't have overlapping storylines), and the manga is no different. The first volume of the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; manga presents four different stories that deal with the characters of the &quot;Bebop&quot;, following their adventures and misadventures as they try to nab bounties so they can collect the reward money and get food in their stomachs. Almost any &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; fan will praise the anime series as having highly original stories and adventures that define the series. Unfortunately, that same fan will most likely look at the stories in the manga and say they are formulaic. Also, the stories has odd pacing issues in several areas, making the volume feel a little unbalanced. Even so, the stories are quite entertaining and do capture some of the charm of the anime. But anyone hoping the manga will hold over as a substitute for the anime until the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; movie arrives on American shores will be sorely disappointed.<br />Visually, some fans might be put off by the artist's interpretation of the characters. Characters in the manga do resemble their anime counterparts, but sometimes they can look a tad-bit distorted. And seeing Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed, and Ein in chibi-like forms can be a little awkward, considering this rarely happened in the anime. Still, the visual artwork of the manga isn't anything to be disgusted at, but fans of the anime will wants to approach this with caution.<br />In terms of translation, I can honestly say that TOKYOPOP is getting better. Previous efforts such as &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; and &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; used text that was most likely typed in a machine, resulting in several horrible typos, and TOKYOPOP has always been known to deliver mediocre translations. With &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, the text appears to be drawn and not typed, resulting in fewer typos; I couldn't find any at all in this volume. While the translation might be questionable to some people, it doesn't sound static and flat; I actually consider this one of TOKYOPOP's better efforts. And with TOKYOPOP's new &quot;100% Authentic Format&quot;, the volume is read right-to-left, giving it a more authentic feel. It also makes the artwork clearer to see; since it hasn't been photo-reversed, the artwork isn't blurred, dimmed, or distorted.<br />All in all, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; is a good manga series, but only for the right kind of person. Fans of the anime will want to be careful with this series, and manga readers unfamiliar with the anime should also be wary. Still, the manga is very entertaining and is good enough to hold the &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; name. And thanks to TOKYOPOP's better-than-normal translation and their &quot;100% Authentic Manga&quot; format, the manga can be enjoyed even further.<br />Until volume 2, &quot;SEE YOU, SPACE COWBOY...&quot;	2002-04-22
US	45356516	R1IZE0DKMVZDCH	156931702X	703791584	Gundam Wing: Episode Zero	Books	5	26	26	N	N	Possibly the greatest &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; manga ever!	The anime series &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; has more manga that deals with sub-stories in the series' universe than the actual series. Manga like &quot;Blind Target&quot; and &quot;Ground Zero&quot; deal with stories outside the stories told within the series, and &quot;Episode Zero&quot; is no exception. So what makes &quot;Episode Zero&quot; different? First of all, it deals mainly with the history of the Gundam pilots, not the events between the series and the &quot;Endless Waltz&quot; movie. Second, and more importantly, most of the information in &quot;Episode Zero&quot; can actually be considered as canon!<br />Of all the &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; manga, &quot;Episode Zero&quot; has to be the largest volume ever. And within this volume are stories that deal with several of the characters' pasts. Many Gundam fans who are familiar with &quot;Endless Waltz&quot; will recognize some of the information in &quot;Episode Zero&quot;, but the tidbits of the stories found in &quot;Endless Waltz&quot; don't do justice to the brilliant storytelling in &quot;Episode Zero&quot;. The stories here can sometimes be a little melodramatic, but they all work beautifully. There are six stories that deal with characters' lives before the series, involving each Gundam pilot and Relena Peacecraft. Another story deals with what happens just before the series' first episode, and the final story is a little cliffhanger tale that occurs after the movie. All in all, it's a very well-rounded package, but the biggest pro is that most of this information can be considered canon. Why? The series' creators didn't have time to add in a lot of the information found in this volume, so they put it in &quot;Episode Zero&quot;. So rest assured that whoever wrote and drew these stories knew what they were talking about. Plus, the novel explains several things you might have wondered about. Ever wonder about the significance of the Relena segment with the teddy bear in the first opening of the series? That's all I'll say about that...<br />Visually, the artwork is amazing. Those who liked &quot;Blind Target&quot; will love &quot;Episode Zero&quot;. Everything is so clean and detailed, and its reminiscent of the beautiful shojo style of manga that made &quot;Blind Target&quot; such a joy. The characters look like they do in the series and, more importantly, they act in character. And VIZ's translation is near perfect, unlike TOKYOPOP's mediocore translation of the three-volume series. The pacing in the stories is dead-on, and the stories actually make sense, especially if you're familiar with the series.<br />All in all, &quot;Episode Zero&quot; is an absolute must-have in any &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; fan's collection. It receives my highest recommendation and it shouldn't be missed.	2002-03-22

Despite the degree of excellence found within the entire &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; series, I never thought any of the later volumes managed to meet the quality of the brilliant first two volumes (although some came close). But Yukito Kishiro surpassed my wildest expectations by giving us &quot;Angel's Ascension&quot;, the final volume in his post-apocalyptic masterpiece, and it's a volume that not only meets the standards of volumes one and two, but also surpasses them in some ways. In short, &quot;Angel's Ascension&quot; is a masterpiece in itself.<br />By now, my stance on the artwork and the recommended reader's level is cliche: the artwork is beautiful and superb, and the blood and violence and minor nudity makes this a mature series. But my take on the storytelling isn't the same as in my other reviews. Why? Because &quot;Angel's Ascension&quot; is on a level all its own.<br />The story in volume nine defies simple description. At its basic level, &quot;Angel's Ascension&quot; reveals the secret of Tiphares and finally cues us in on Alita's long forgotten past. But the story is anything but basic. It is so beautiful, so powerful, so moving, so captivating, that to just read it would be a downright shame. A reader has to not only read it, but practically drown himself in it! Yukito started the series with two near-perfect volumes (&quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; and &quot;Tears of an Angel&quot;), and I'm overjoyed that he decided to end the series on the same note.<br />After reading and reviewing all nine volumes of &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot;, I can honestly say that the series is one of the greatest manga series I've ever read, on par with classics such as &quot;Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;. The only disappointment? That the ride is over.<br />Or is it? Believe it or not, Yukito Kishiro has created another &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; series, called &quot;Gunnm: Last Order&quot; (&quot;Gunnm&quot; is the Japanese name for &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot;). Apparently, before he could complete the first series, &quot;an affair&quot; happened to Yukito and he went through a physical and emotional breakdown that caused him to end &quot;Gunnm&quot; in a way he hadn't planned. Since then, he felt guilty about how he ended the series...so much that in 2000 he suspended his new series, &quot;Aquaknight&quot; (all three current volumes are available by VIZ), so he could write a new &quot;Gunnm&quot; series!<br />Will we learn new things about Alita we had never dreamed of? Will Yukito create another masterpiece? And the big question: will VIZ bring &quot;Gunnm: Last Order&quot; to the United States? We can only hope. Until then, this nine volume collection should more than keep us entertained!	2002-01-15

In my review of &quot;Angel of Chaos&quot;, I mentioned how Yukito Kishiro probably rushed the story in volume seven somewhat because he was pressed for time. With volume eight, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, it seems Kishiro decided to return the story to a more stable pace. And with everything else exactly the same, that can only mean this volume is superb in every way.<br />In &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, the abrupt and almost confusing ending of &quot;Angel of Chaos&quot; is made clearer, and the conflicts Alita faces are thrust into the picture. Will she kill Kaos because of what he is, or will she allow him to live? Will she or will she not still follow orders from her masters after she discovers why they saved her in volume six? How will she react when she finally finds her long lost and resurrected &quot;father,&quot; Doc Ido?<br />Thanks to Yukito's masterful storytelling, these questions and more are explored in &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;. And his art remains as crisp and beautiful as it was in the first &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; volume. And, as always, the amount of graphic violence and gore (pictures of women hacked up by a sadist, anyone?) keeps Alita a mature readers' series.<br />With that said, how does &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; compare with the first seven volumes? I'd have to put it on the same or just above the level of volume five, &quot;Angel of Redemption&quot;, because while nothing can match the quality of the first two volumes, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; is definately a work of high quality.<br />And with the cliffhanger at the end of the volume, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; is guaranteed to bring people back for the final volume. Yes, sadly, the volume after &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; is the last &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; volume...at least for now. But despite that, volume eight manages to keep us solidly entertained while at the same time preparing us for the grand finale of volume nine!	2002-01-14

Fantasy is probably one of the most difficult forms of literature to write a story. While the genre does give an author freedom to create a breathtaking and beautiful world of his own, the author has to make that world believable, which can be quite a daunting task. Thankfully, the editors of &quot;Writer's Digest&quot; books have given us &quot;The Writer's Complete Fantasy Reference&quot; so fantasy authors, newbies and pros alike, can do just such a thing.<br />The book starts out with an excellent introduction by renowned fantasy author Terry Brooks, and his words effectively tells the reader the lessons a fantasy author must learn to make his fiction acceptable. Then comes the rest of the book, all of the material to help a fantasy author realize his potential.<br />Although this is a reference book, I seriously recommend going through the entire book cover to cover, or at least skim over some of the important points. That way, you can get a sense of what this book really has to offer and you can return to the right pages when an idea strikes you.<br />The book covers practically everything, from cultures to magic to religions to monsters to clothing to castle anatomy...almost everything a fantasy author could want at his disposal. The amount of information within this book is so immense it's nearly impossible not to find something to beef up a story.<br />But at the same time, this book doesn't get too big-headed. While it does contain a lot of information, it doesn't brag about possessing everything known to man on the subjects found in the book. In fact, the book encourages the writer to branch out and look for other sources related to the information within the book. Chapter Two, World Cultures, especially encourages the author to research more information than the book could ever hold.<br />All in all, &quot;The Writer's Complete Fantasy Reference&quot; is honestly complete, at least in a sense. It encompasses all the important points a fantasy author should be aware about and would most likely find interesting or look up in the future. But at the same time, it encourages the author to do his own research so he can find things not even this reference could find. I highly recommend this book for anyone writing fantasy, ameteur or pro. It's that good.	2002-01-13
US	45356516	R185DH0ZEMW1SR	0345445600	669379389	The Hobbit: An Illustrated Edition of the Fantasy Classic	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A classic in its own right...but ONLY in its own right!	&quot;First published in the United States more than sixty years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Hobbit' has become one of the best-loved books of all time. Tolkien's fantasy was then adapted into a fully painted graphic novel, which became a classic in its own right...&quot;<br />These words are found on the back of the graphic novel's cover, and I'm glad that's all they say about the possible quality of the book. Thankfully, the graphic novel isn't praised to be as equally good as the actual book, because while it is indeed good, it doesn't compare to Tolkien's early literary masterpiece.<br />I'm not familiar with American graphic novels (Japanese manga is more my trade), so I can't fairly compare this graphic novel to other graphic novels. However, I can say that this book does make use of the term &quot;graphic novel&quot;: it runs somewhat like a comic book, using pictures, and is occasionally filled with excerpts of storytelling from the original book. So it's not really a comic book, and it's definately not a novel, so it most likely really is a graphic novel, but I really can't say for sure.<br />The artwork of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; graphic novel is like everything else that's been used with the Middle-Earth licence: some will like it, some will hate it. The color scheme reminds me of an oil painting and the character designs appear somewhat &quot;old-school,&quot; although some people won't have any trouble with that style. To my knowledge, all of the story of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is in the graphic novel, but expect some scenes to be condensed. The pacing can be a little off, and sometimes things just happen out of the blue. Still, the execution of the entire graphic novel is very well done and, and it does manage to capture quite a bit of the believability of Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth.<br />This is where the biggest problem arises. The graphic novel is good, but it is no substitute for the actual book. To read this graphic novel as a substitute for the book is like reading Cliff Notes in place of an enjoyable literary classic. It's interesting to read after reading the book, but that's it. Reading the graphic novel before the book and expecting to get the exact same experiece takes away a lot of the magic Tolkien created.<br />All in all, this graphic novel is good, but it's nothing compared to the real deal. I recommend only reading this after reading the original book; to do otherwise would be denying to yourself the beauty and magic of Tolkien's early masterwork. It's a classic graphic novel, but nothing more.e book is like reading Cliff Notes in place of an enjoyable literary classic. It's interesting to read after reading the book, but that's it.

As I learned from Yukito Kishiro's own website, Kishiro was pressed for time to finish &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot;. I think he started to hurry the story somewhere in volume seven, &quot;Angel of Chaos&quot;. While it didn't fall short like the motorball volumes, it came close to doing so.<br />After the bizarre ending of &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, Alita leaves her new boyfriend, Figure Four, promising to return. This does cause the reader to wonder whether Figure plays any major role at all in the story and whether &quot;Angel of Death&quot; served any purpose, but luckily it's not too big of a deal. Thankfully, the story does jump right on track with Alita's mission: finding Desty Nova, the man who indirectly killed Doc Ido and promised to rebuild him. We are also reunited with an old friend grown up, and some brand new characters that fit right into the story.<br />As always, Kishiro's art is top notch and his storytelling is superb, filled with love, hate, betrayal, and interesting plot twists. And, as always, squirmish amounts of blood and gore make this for mature readers only. But while the story is still good, volume seven runs into a few problems with its pacing. Sometimes the story moves too quickly, causing a reader to wonder what just happened. An example would be a man is about to kill someone when a metal dog appears to save her. The metal dog appears seemingly out of nowhere; he just arrives. But the pacing problems are most evident in the ending. I won't spoil it, but I will say it felt a little shorter than it could've been.<br />But to make up for the pacing problem is something rarely seen in the previous &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; volumes: humor. One of the new characters, Lou Collins, is a reinarnation of Shumira from volumes three, four, and five, but she is a lot more funny and interesting. We also get to see something else rarely found in &quot;Battle Angel&quot;: chibi-Alita. I won't give anything away, but I will say it adds a lot to the humor already found in this volume.<br />All in all, &quot;Angel of Chaos&quot; does still manage to stay on the same level with the &quot;good&quot; volumes. Its pacing problems might frustrate some people, but the majority of readers will ignore then in favor of concentrating on Kishiro's beautiful story.o the humor already found in this volume.<br />All in all, &quot;Angel of Chaos&quot; does still manage to stay on the same level with the &quot;good&quot; volumes.

These days, there are only a few graphic novels out there that can really be called graphic novels. This small, elite group include &quot;Maus&quot;, &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, and &quot;Akira&quot;. And one of the greatest and most unique of these graphic masterpieces is Hayao Miyazaki's &quot;Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind&quot;.<br />When reading this four book series, anyone familiar with the movie &quot;Warriors of the Wind&quot;, a horribly-butchered version of the Japanese version, will immediately recognize how superior the graphic novel is to the movie; anyone who hasn't even heard of Miyazaki, let alone the movie, will discover why Miyazaki is considered a legend in Japan and a god to US animators. While the Japanese movie is excellent, the true essence of the movie is found within the graphic novels.<br />The plot is built around Nausicaa, the princess of the Valley of Wind, but the story encompasses many other figures that are equally important. The sheer scope of the story reads like an epic, and it isn't filled with the usual good-and-evil, black-and-white ideals found in children films. No one is good, no one is evil. Every person in the story is a human being: realistic, fleshed-out, and flawed. To try and explain the plot of &quot;Nausicaa&quot; would degrade how beautiful it really is. A reader can only truly appreciate its by actually reading it.<br />Accompanying the excellent plot is Miyazaki's truly unique artistic style. Most Japanese manga artists use tones (pre-rendered shades and styles) to &quot;color&quot; their work, but &quot;Nausicaa&quot; is different. Instead of tones, he uses pencil strokes that give different shades depending upon the strokes' size and distance from each other. This creates a magnificent sight not found anywhere else in graphic novel literature. Of course, since VIZ released all four novels in &quot;perfect collection&quot; volumes, the artwork can sometimes appear a little blurred and blended. Luckily, the overall artwork isn't ruined and does justice to Miyazaki's masterpiece.<br />But a great story and beautiful artwork can be ruined by a terrible translation. Thankfully, the translators of &quot;Nausicaa&quot; didn't allow such a thing to happen. They obviously put their hearts and souls into this story, and it only increases the reader's enjoyment. There is a reason why it was on a list of the best manga translated into English!<br />All in all, &quot;Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind&quot; is a superb graphic novel of epic proportions. While some might think of &quot;Nausicaa&quot; as a comic book meant only for children, &quot;Nausicaa&quot; is far more than that. It is a beautiful work that is considered by many as Miyazaki's greatest accomplishment. Several scenes of violence and death might make this suitable only for older readers. But other than that, anyone who loves a good story will enjoy &quot;Nausicaa&quot;.	2001-12-29

In a perfect transition from volume five, the story of Alita continues beautifully with &quot;Beyond the Yellow Door&quot;. However, the later parts of volume six, &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, might seem as meaningless and weak as the motorball volumes, volumes three and four. But that depends upon your tastes, really. For me, &quot;Angel of Death&quot; is a perfect demonstration of what the motorball volumes should have been!<br />With volume six, Alita becomes nothing but a weapon, a tool, and a good deal of the volume is spent with Alita fighting and battling. Of course, the still-beautiful artwork is filled with mature-audience blood and gore, so it's good to see Yukito Kishiro maintain his sense of dedication to the series. Probably the part where people might run into problems is with the plot.<br />Unlike the motorball episodes, volume six doesn't divert too far away from the main plot, but some of the volume is dedicated to a new character, Figure Four, who eventually falls for Alita (and vice versa). &quot;Angel of Death&quot; doesn't make it clear whether Figure Four plays a major role in future volumes, so this might frustrate some Alita fans. Also, the growth of the relationship between Alita and Figure Four isn't too realistic and feels a little sloppy.<br />But does this make &quot;Angel of Death&quot; like the motorball volumes? Not really. The main plot does manage to stay that way throughout the book: main. And although there is a lot of seemingly needless fighting, it can be considered &quot;enjoyable&quot; needless fighting. What fan of Alita doesn't want to see her wield a scythe-like blade with an evil snicker on her face? It's a lot better than seeing Alita battle for a silly motorball!<br />All in all, &quot;Angel of Death&quot; does make a few questionable choices in its execution, but in the end it's still an enjoyable read. But even if you feel that &quot;Angel of Death&quot; fell as low as the motorball volumes, look at it this way: at least the story in &quot;Angel of Death&quot; didn't span another volume!	2001-12-24

In the world of &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; manga, there are three stories that give their version of the time period between the television series and the &quot;Endless Waltz&quot; movie. They are &quot;Ground Zero&quot; (VIZ), &quot;Battlefield of Pacifists&quot; (to be available from TOKYOPOP in 2002), and &quot;Blind Target&quot; (VIZ). And of all of these, &quot;Blind Target&quot; is probably the best of them.<br />Compared to &quot;Ground Zero&quot;, &quot;Blind Target&quot; is more action-packed and probably more realistic. Both works are done in the shojo (girls) style of manga, but &quot;Blind Target&quot; manages to make everyone look their age, unlike &quot;Ground Zero&quot; where some characters looked almost 10-years old. While there isn't any mecha fighting that involves the Gundams, the action level in &quot;Blind Target&quot; is enough to satisfy any readers who were disappointed by the lack of action in &quot;Ground Zero&quot;. The story is excellent, and it perfectly explains several things that take place later in &quot;Endless Waltz&quot;.<br />While &quot;Ground Zero&quot; shows the more emotional side of &quot;Gundam Wing&quot;, &quot;Blind Target&quot; actually perfects the balance of both action and emotional characterization. Characters don't act out of character, and the pacing is just perfect. Also, the artwork is superb. Some readers might find it odd when they see some people missing an eye, but the beautiful shojo style of the characters is enough to make readers ignore this for the most part. Finally, &quot;Blind Target&quot; contains the famous (or infamous) kiss scene (or almost-kiss scene, whichever you believe) between Heero and Relena.<br />Unfortunately, there is one gripe I have with &quot;Blind Target&quot;. Spread throughout the book are one page sections called Remixes, and these are basically &quot;newspaper articles&quot; that talk about certain characters and analyzes some of the characters' relationships. The pictures found in these articles are terrible, because these pictures are originally from the TV series and movie and were originally in color. The transfer from color to black and white was very poorly done, and some pictures are almost impossible to make out. These articles are also the most likely places to find typos, although there are not that many. Luckily, the Remixes aren't the main focus of the manga and can be ignored entirely, although it would've been nice to see them done better.<br />All in all, &quot;Blind Target&quot; is an excellent manga side story in the &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; universe. Although both this and &quot;Ground Zero&quot; are good in their own right, I recommend this over &quot;Ground Zero&quot; any day. Just ignore the poor quality of the Remixes and pay attention to the teriffic story and artwork of the actual manga, and that's all there is to enjoying &quot;Blind Target&quot;.	2001-12-05

Of the earlier &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; series, volumes one and two were excellent in all areas, and volumes three and four were still good but a step down in the quality of story-telling. This volume, number five, &quot;Angel of Redemption&quot;, raises the quality of the plot back to where it should be.<br />The story of &quot;Angel of Redemption&quot; takes place two years after Alita's motorball stint, when she has gotten over her loss of Hugo and has regained her life with Ido and other friends. But as we all know, Alita's past won't let her live in peace for long. With teriffic pacing and use of an exceptional story, Yukito Kishiro creates beautiful scenes where an old enemy of Alita resurfaces and where she ultimately discovers loneliness and abandonment.<br />Kishiro's art is still as good as ever, filled with spectacular atistry that immediately draws the reader into the story. The high violence and gore factor is also still here, so this is still a series for mature audiences. The pacing and quality of the story returns from the slight slump of volumes three and four, back to the level of volumes one and two.<br />There is, however, one thing that makes volume five totally unique, and in a few ways better, than volumes one and two. The first two volumes don't have very powerful cliffhangers, so while the stories in these volumes are teriffic, they don't give the reader something to look forward to in the next volume. Volume five does have a powerful cliffhanger (although it's not a major plot twist kind of cliffhanger), and the reader will desperately want to know what will happen in volume six.<br />If you've read the first four volumes, you won't be disappointed by volume five. If you haven't read the first four volumes but enjoy beautiful art, beautiful story-telling, and can stomach high levels of violence and gore, then &quot;Battle Angel Alia&quot; is for you.	2001-12-02

Since &quot;Killing Angel&quot; and &quot;Angel of Victory&quot; are considered a two-part story, this review will be about both of them.<br />The third volume in &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot;, &quot;Killing Angel&quot;, continues Yukito Kishiro's engaging and engrossing story about Alita, the cyborg who has no memories of her past yet memory of a powerful fighting technique. After the tragic events in &quot;Tears of an Angel&quot;, Alita runs away to become a contestant in the terrible sport of motorball. Ido, heartbroken by her leaving him, is determined to get her back.<br />This story seems good on paper, but unfortunately, Kishiro made the story drawn out in the third volume. The first few parts of &quot;Killing Angel&quot; were excellent, but the next stream of parts could've been done in a shorter amount of time and space. That's not to say that &quot;Killing Angel&quot; isn't good, but parts of it could've had their pace quickened a little. In a way, however, this volume can be seen as the prelude to the much better fourth volume, &quot;Angel of Victory&quot;.<br />&quot;Angel of Victory&quot; can also probably be seen as drawn out, but it's far less obvious. The story in this volume still deals with Alita's motorball obsession, but parts of the story return the plot to the main point of the first two volumes: Alita searching for her past. While &quot;Killing Angel&quot; and &quot;Angel of Victory&quot; are a two-part series, I see &quot;Angel of Victory&quot; as the better of the two because of its return to the reason why we fell in love with &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; in the first place.<br />All in all, these two volumes make a good continuation of the first two volumes, but they are sadly a step down in storytelling quality.

US	45356516	RYT8E98SUE8G	1892213362	563276030	Cardcaptor Sakura 1	Books	5	0	0	N	N	An amusing and different read from ordinary manga.	At first glance, &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; looks like nothing more than a crossbreed between &quot;Sailormoon&quot; and &quot;Pokemon&quot;. The truth is that this manga series is far from that!<br />Anyone who loves or is familiar with CLAMP's style will recognize the artwork found in this manga series. While it isn't the best example of artwork when compared to those of &quot;X/1999&quot; and &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;, &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; still looks good. The depiction of characters is very well done (especially if the character happens to be one with long hair). And CLAMP always knows how to make scenes go from dead serious to slapstick comical with smooth transition.<br />The translation is also well done, although, I admit, I'm not an expert at manga translation. I can say with certainty that while it might not be the best translation in the world, it's far better than the translation of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot;. TOKYOPOP's familiar name altering habit is also found here, but it's not as obvious as it is in &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;. The bottom line: the translation is good enough to satisfy everyone except perfectionist purists.<br />The story of &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; might seem a little familiar and boring, but it is far from that. Oh, sure, it resembles the &quot;collecting/fighting of monsters&quot; theme found in other anime/manga like &quot;Pokemon&quot; and &quot;Sailormoon&quot;, but if you take the time to read this manga carefully you'll see it's actually a standout, even a near mockery, of those other series! CLAMP's twisted humor is funny and enough to make &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; stand apart from other boring manga. It's also not afraid to deal (although lightly) with some mature themes such as homosexuality and young marriage.<br />All in all, &quot;Cardcaptor Sakura&quot; is one of CLAMP's best works that is a must for any serious manga fan's collection. While it appears shojo, both boys andgirls can enjoy this manga. And while it is very different from the anime series, this manga has very little chance of disappointing.	2001-10-22

If &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; merely introduced us to the amazing cyber world of Yukito Kishiro, then &quot;Battle Angel Alita: Tears of an Angel&quot; builds upon that world and, more than likely, sets in motion the plot.<br />After her victory over the all-powerful &quot;King of the Maggots&quot; in the first manga volume, Alita now faces her toughest challenge yet: love. Yes, love. While that phrase usually sounds cliched, it applies perfectly in this second manga volume. Alita has it tough to begin with, but when things start to spiral down even further, she must make a choice that could end up destroying her.<br />Like before, the artwork is beautiful and very detailed. And, like before, &quot;Tears of an Angel&quot; is riddled with violence and blood and gore that sticks it in the section of mature readers who have very strong stomahchs. The story is a superb, miniature masterpiece, and it undoubtedly adds to the internal conflict of Alita trying to find her identity.<br />This second volume is also featured in the &quot;Gunnm&quot; two episode OVA anime series (&quot;Gunnm&quot; is the original name of the &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; series.) Like before, I advise you to read the manga before watching the series, as comparisons will most likely decrease the enjoyment of the manga. But with that said, enjoy &quot;Tears of an Angel&quot;. Along with the first volume, the second volume is a superb triumph.	2001-10-17

Do you ever wonder if there's a manga series out there that's filled with gut-wrenching violence yet actually has a plot? Then look no further than &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot;, a perfect hybrid of a killer story and plenty of blood &amp; gore action.<br />With all the magic-girl and alternate-world and mecha-oriented manga/anime out there today, &quot;Battle Angel Alia&quot; is quite a breath of fresh air. The story focuses on Alita (Gally in the Japanese version) and her quest to find her lost past, with only a powerful fighting instinct as her clue. This concept alone draws the reader into the story, and the enjoyment factor is quickly heightened by the well-fleshed out characters. Even the bad guys seem to have motives behind their actions! Of course, it's not &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; morality, but it's still very believable.<br />The art is beautifully drawn and always serious, meaning characters don't use chibi-like ways to express their emotions (ex: tear drop on head for embarrasment, wide eyes for surprise). But that doesn't mean there isn't humor found in this book; it's just not one of the main focuses. One of the main focuses in undoubtedly the blood and gore, which is more than enough to make this for a mature audience only. This manga isn't afraid to show people getting sliced, diced, impaled, shattered, and all the other terminology that applies. Scenes of this nature include a criminal ripping a man's scalp off and drinking the man's brain, and that same criminal placing another man's brain on his tongue with an eyeball still attached to the brain before eating it. Trust me, it's enough to make even those with iron stomachs squirm. <br />The plot? Excellent! The story might seem to lag a little near the end of the book, but it all comes together beautifully, in my opinion. And besides, this first volume is merely the introduction to the world Alita will face. The next eight books in the series will undoubtedly steer towards Alita's quest to find herself.<br />All in all, &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; is a must-have for any serious manga fan. Word of warning, however. There is a two episode anime OVA series that focuses on the first two volumes in the manga. I advise you to watch it only after reading the manga, because expectations might not be as high when done vice versa. But with all that said, enjoy entering the world of &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot;!	2001-10-17

These days, science-fiction is being filled with cliches and reused plots. Luckily, however, it's good to know that there are authors who can come up with original and brilliant ideas. David Brin has done just that with &quot;Sundiver&quot;, the first book in both the &quot;Uplift&quot; series and first &quot;Uplift&quot; trilogy.<br />The &quot;Uplift&quot; novels are centered around the idea of &quot;uplifting,&quot; which is one of the most original ideas I've come across in science-fiction. I won't go into detail about uplifting, but I will say it sets the stage for some interesting ideas that can be(and, for the most part, were) used in the novel.<br />However, this is probably where the only gripe I had with the book comes into play. Instead of concentrating on the idea of uplifting, &quot;Sundiver&quot; focuses more on a mystery being played out and how the various aliens in the story are involved. Uplifting takes a backseat in the story and is usually used as reasoning behind why events occur.<br />But that really doesn't matter, because I feel that &quot;Sundiver&quot; is a book used to introduce the reader to the &quot;Uplift&quot; universe and set the stage for the next few novels to follow. If &quot;Sundiver&quot; had been a lone book, it would've been a major disappointment. Luckily, that's not the case.<br />The story itself in &quot;Sundiver&quot; is beautifully played out and very well-constructed, although it does tend to move a little fast at times, particularly in the beginning. The aliens in Brin's world are alone worth getting the book, because Brin, who knows his stuff, makes them interesting yet believable at the same time. Of course, it's not the best story in the world, but it's definately worth any science-fiction fan's time to look into it.<br />All in all, &quot;Sundiver&quot; acts as a good starting point to the rest of the &quot;Uplift&quot; series, which will most likely play upon the idea of uplifting a great deal more. Combined witha pretty good story and a terrific, original environment, &quot;Sundiver&quot; demands to be given a chance.	2001-09-30

If you've every heard about the basic plot of &quot;Inu-Yasha&quot; -- unlikely allies must collect the pieces of a mystical object before it falls into the wrong hands -- then you might think of this series as a rehack with boring, stale story. Think again!<br />Despite the reused plot device, Rumiko Takahashi's &quot;Inu-Yasha&quot; is actually one of the most refreshing things to come along in a long time. And while it does have the usual &quot;magical Japanese school girl&quot; theme, take a look at some other great manga -- &quot;Fushigi Yuugi&quot;, &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;, &quot;Ayashi no Ceres&quot; -- that uses the exact same concept yet still manages to amaze and develop a mass following.<br />With &quot;Inu-Yasha&quot;, however, there's an added bonus other than Kagome, the magical school girl: the title character, half-dog demon Inu-Yasha. You may not know it from the first volume of the series, but Inu-Yasha is more than the typical anti-hero. Add to the mix a bunch of other odd yet interesting characters, and you have the setting to a terrific manga series.<br />Visually, Takahashi probably can't get any better (although, I must admit, I haven't seen any other other works to compare this to). Everything -- the characters, monsters, surroundings -- is beautifully depicted, often using the Japanese method of &quot;blending&quot; scenes together. But it must be mentioned that this manga isn't suitable for young children. There are scenes containing nudity (although it is very mild), and some scenes contain a lot of blood and gore that might make even some older readers squirm uncomfortably.<br />One of the main attractions of &quot;Inu-Yasha&quot; has to be Takahashi's humor. I have never found anything that made me laugh so hard in my entire life. But another main attraction has to be the complexity of the characters. You might have to read two or three volumes to really understand the complex relationships between the characters, but the farther the story goes, the more &quot;fleshed-out&quot; the characters become. I won't write any spoilers, but I will say this: why is Rumiko Takahashi called the &quot;Queen of Romantic Comedy&quot;?<br />At the time of this review, nine volumes of &quot;Inu-Yasha&quot; have been translated and published by VIZ. From a person who has read all these volumes, I can say that &quot;Inu-Yasha&quot; is turning into a profound and intriguing story. The series in Japanese is (currently) 22 volumes long, and I'm sure it's going to continue even farther. So I warn you: if you're interested in &quot;Inu-Yasha&quot;, make sure you have ample resources to buy the entire series, because this is a difficult series to let go of once you start!<br />With that in mind, enjoy! &quot;Inu-Yasha&quot; is a must-have for any serious manga collector's collection!	2001-09-29
US	45356516	RBD968LN0HFLW	1892213419	469635462	Gundam Wing #1	Books	4	0	0	N	N	An interesting series, but not the best out there.	With the market starting to recognize how much people love manga, titles that would've most likely never have seen the light of day in America several years ago are now appearing in droves. Many of these series are quality titles that truly show how manga is done right, but some of these titles are ones that were released to capitalize on a sudden trend. The three-volume \\"Mobile Suit Gundam Wing\\" manga is one of the latter group, and while it's not bad, it isn't something a serious manga reader would want to have in his collection.<br />The \\"Gundam Wing\\" manga tells the story that takes place during the 49-episode anime series. However, readers familiar with the series will notice two things: (1) the manga moves at a much faster pace than the anime; and (2) several plot elements have been changed, altered, or omitted. While the second factor isn't too much of a bad thing, the first factor is what really hurts the manga. Scenes that took up several episodes in the anime series suddenly take only a few pages, which removes quite a bit of characterization. In the first volume especially, the story doesn't feel smooth or connected, but more like a plot summary. The story does feel a lot smoother and better developed as the series continues, but the overall impact is hurt by the rushed plot. It also unfortunately makes the \\"Gundam Wing\\" manga fan-only publications, as only fans of the series will understand the plot.<br />In regards to the second factor, the changes and omissions in the story are actually a matter of taste. Some people might not like the idea of having their favorite anime scene cut from the manga, but others might actually like the changes and refreshing look at the series. Of course, omissions and alterations do mean that character appearances and personality developments are altered somewhat, but an open-minded \\"Gundam Wing\\" fan might actually enjoy reading a different \\"version\\" of the anime series.<br />Visually, \\"Gundam Wing\\" can't be called the most visually-appealing manga on the market today. Characters do look like thier anime counterparts, but not in a detailed kind of way. However, the actual Gundams and all other mobile suits are drawn rather nicely, so fans of the mecha shouldn't be disappointed. If the artwork of the manga had to be called something, I'd say it is slightly above average.<br />In regards to the translation, \\"Gundam Wing\\" unfortunately shows the badside of TOKYOPOP. It's easy to see that the type-like text was written using a machine, and this resulted in some unfortunate spelling errors (ie \\"Leader\\" instead of \\"Lead her\\", \\"Berge\\" instead of \\"Barge\\", etc.). And the translation as a whole is sadly mediocre, as it feels stiff and emotionless, showing how little the translators cared about this manga. Why else was Trowa called Noin in the first volume? Because the translators didn't put in the effort to check their own work. Still, if you can stand a bad dub on an anime, then the translation shouldn't be too much of a hindrance.<br />But the manga does have a really good feature going for it: the \\"Domon W\\" strips at the back of each volume. Essentially, these are four-panel strips that use chibi-like representations of the characters of \\"Gundam Wing\\" and \\"G Gundam\\". Some of these strips are downright hilarious, some of them are completely lame, but they definately bring up the value of the manga volumes.<br />All in all, \\"Gundam Wing\\" cannot be called the best manga out there. It's painfully obvious that TOKYOPOP released the series quickly to capitalize on the booming interest in the then-recently released \\"Gundam Wing\\" anime; if they had just paid more attention to the translation, the manga would've been so much better. But as it stands, the three-volume manga series can only be recommended with reservations. If you're looking for good \\"Gundam Wing\\" manga, rather try \\"Episode Zero\\" or \\"Blind Target\\". If you want good manga in general, try \\"Inu-Yasha\\", \\"Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind\\", or \\"Battle Angel Alita\\".	2001-09-27

For all those die-hard Gundam fans who were disappointed with the three-volume manga, this will more than make up for it.<br />Like the title says, this book displays a collection of pictures -- original ones or screenshots from the anime -- that is, simply, the art of &quot;Gundam Wing.&quot; The book does a good job of fairly balancing the pictures of the five pilots as well as other important characters. For those who surf the web a great deal, many of these pictures will be recognized immediately. And many people might also notice that the pictures are a lot crisper, clearer, and cleaner than some found on fansites, which is alone worth the price of the book.<br />However, there is also a good deal of pictures that have most likely not been found on the internet (although they probably will be soon because of people with scanners and a lot of free time). These pictures heighten the worth of the book, and the fact that they were drawn by the artists who worked on the anime makes it all the more satisfying. After all, where do the original artists take the time to add more of their talent to a collection of already-beautiful artwork?<br />All in all, there was only once complaint I had, and that was that the book was a little short. The book is only about 96 pages of art, with a brief interview with the artists. Despite this setback, the book is definately a must-have for anyone who's ever enjoyed the artwork and wants to gloss over it for days on end. Try and say something like that about &quot;Pokemon&quot;!	2001-09-27

At this moment, I do not know whether or not this manga associates or even connects with the &quot;Blind Target&quot; manga, but it doesn't matter. This comic is called Reku Fuyunagi's &quot;version&quot; of the time period between the Gundam Wing anime series and the Endless Waltz movie, and it is very good.<br />For those who are familiar with the three-volume Gundam Wing manga (for good or ill), this manga will definately appear different in almost very way. For starters, &quot;Ground Zero&quot; involved the work of a leading shoujo (girls) manga artist, so don't expect any Gundam mecha fighting and expect a lot of emotional confrontations between the characters. A few of the characters (particularly Relena and Wufei) are drawn in a way that makes them look younger than they really are, almost like 10-year olds. But that doesn't mean a Gundam fan, male as well as female, can't enjoy this delightful work.<br />Being influenced by a shoujo artist, the characterization and emotional tensions are a lot more apparent and satisfying than the Gundam Wing three-volume manga. And it isn't always serious; one minute Heero looks determined and serious, and the next he resembles a by-stander from &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;. The action found here might not be too satisfying to readers who want hard-core mecha action fight scenes, but for me this manga shows a side of &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; that defines the series. After all, if &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; didn't have its complex story and deep characterization, it would be nothing more than an animated version of &quot;Power Rangers.&quot; There's also the added bonus of Trowa actually laughing more than once (it's true!) and Relena lovers will definately love the last part of the manga.<br />Of course, nothing's perfect, and this is no exception. Fans of both the series and the Endless Waltz movie will find a few inconsistencies here, but anyone except a purist perfectionist can easily overlook them.<br />All in all, this is a worthy addition to the Gundam Wing universe, despite being someone's &quot;version.&quot; For (the majority of) female readers, it'll show the side of the anime they enjoyed through the Gundam battles and fights. For (the majority of) male readers, it'll show the factor that made sure &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; wasn't just another mindless mecha-robot show.	2001-09-27

A long time ago, an English playwright named William Shakespeare wrote a play called &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which eventually grew into his most popular and respected play. In this century, a man named Tom Stoppard wrote a play called &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, which was based on &quot;Hamlet&quot; and probably became Stoppard's most recognized and popular play.<br />The play takes place through the eyes of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (R&amp;G), which were two minor characters in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. You'd think that a play through the eys of such minor characters would be boring, but Stoppard proves this to be far from the truth. What Stoppard doesn't do is give R&amp;G strong personalities; in fact, they are almost as empty and flat as they were in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which is exactly what they're supposed to be. If a viewer of this play read or saw &quot;Hamlet&quot;, he recognizes that R&amp;G basically do in &quot;R&amp;G Are Dead&quot; only what they do in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. And even though they have the possibility to alter the future, they choose not to, which ends in their inevitable deaths. The humor found in the play is funny and teriffic, but in the end it's haunting, filled with Stoppard's subliminal philosophy.<br />To fully appreciate &quot;R&amp;G Are Dead&quot;, I really suggest reading &quot;Hamlet&quot; first. That way, the reader will fully understand what happens in &quot;R&amp;G Are Dead&quot;, and why this play is so beautiful yet so eerie.	2001-09-22

Die-hard fans of the anime series will most likely detest this three-volume manga because of its rushed storyline and tendancy to edit scenes that are trademarks of the show. But fans who managed to get through or even liked the first two volumes will most likely find this third and final volume a fitting conclusion.<br />All the cons mentioned before are found here, as are the pros (I won't mention them again). But here are some new thoughts on this volume. It now becomes even more suggestive (to me, at least) that this series was a &quot;version&quot; of the Gundam Wing storyline, not a replication as many fans wanted. It is also most likely targeted to just fans of the series, for those not familiar with the Gundam Wing universe will most likely be confused and perplexed, even with the first volume.<br />Several changes made to the anime's storyline in the third manga volume were surprisingly good, and characterization also managed to creep in sometimes. Fight scenes tended to be a little short, but they were plentiful. Even the ending, although not consistent to the anime, was satisfactory for me. And, as before, the Domon strips in the back made me crack up and crack up hard.<br />All in all, the third volume compliments the first two nicely. As a series, however, readers can't deny that this manga didn't stay true to the anime (a sin to some fans). This series is worth it if you don't mind the rushed storyline and odd quirks, but there are definately better and more fulfilling manga series out there, including but not limited to: &quot;Inu-Yasha&quot;, &quot;X/1999&quot;, &quot;Fushigi Yuugi&quot;, &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot;, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, &quot;Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, and &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;.<br />In any case, enjoy!	2001-09-07

After being entranced by anime such as &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; and &quot;Princess Mononoke,&quot; I decided to give manga a try, so I asked a friend, &quot;What's a good manga series to have if you have to have just one?&quot; His response: &quot; 'Inu-Yasha,' hands down.&quot; Taking his advice, I tried the first volume. After reading it, one word: &quot;Wow!&quot;<br />&quot;Inu-Yasha&quot; is definately one of the best things I've come across in a long time, and this is from a guy who spent most of his life reading sci-fi/fantasy novels. The story isn't too original -- Japanese high-school girl Kagome gets transported into the past and must collect the pieces of a mystical jewel with the help of the half-demon Inu-Yasha -- but then again, take a look at other outstanding manga: &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;, &quot;Fushigi Yuugi&quot;...you get my point. Although the plot might not be original, a manga artist has to come up with a way to approach that plot in a fresh way. And Rumiko Takahashi does that in a well-crafted and satisfying way.<br />Takahashi's artwork is superb...the ideal thing to start off any newbie's manga collection. The way she frames scenes is so good I can picture it in my mind. Blood and gore are present, and it's not just like a person's head being cut off; it's like a person's head being EATEN off! Luckily, however, the violence doesn't abound too much to draw the reader away from the manga's main attraction: Takahashi's humor. Never in my entire life have I laughed so hard at a work of fiction. The humor is so perfect it'll be hard to find another &quot;anything&quot; that can even compare to this. And while there is some nudity, it is very, very minor and doesn't interfere with the story at all.<br />All in all, &quot;Inu-Yasha&quot; is probably the best way to jump-start a manga collection. The plot might be old, but Takahashi breathes new life into it with her own personal style. There will never be another &quot;Inu-Yasha.&quot; Even the &quot;Inu-Yasha&quot; animated series, which follows this manga very closely, can't even come close to the beauty this graphic novel offers.	2001-09-07

Try and say something like that about &quot;Pokemon&quot;!	2001-09-04

I'll try to do so again with this second review.<br />If one's bought the second volume in this manga series, then he most likely either loves it to death or hates it and wants to see if it has any hope lingering somewhere. For the most part, however, it's probably someone who is used to the obvious fast pacing of the story and questionable editing of material from the anime series. The fast pacing returns in this second volume, and if you loved the first volume you'll definately be used to the second one.<br />A few questionable cons of the first volume make it to the second volume, such as the sound effects (&quot;Dash&quot;, &quot;Step&quot;) and distorted characters. However, for me, I feel this volume managed to eliminate -- for the most part, at least -- weak dialogue and the sense that the artists were trying to rush the series. When one reads through the entire second volume, he instead considers the possibility that this migt be the artists' own take on the anime, like Tim Burton's remake of &quot;Planet of the Apes.&quot; But one can only consider this possiblilty if he actually enjoyed the first volume.<br />Another thing I noticed is that characterization was a little more noticable than in the first volume. This is probably due to the fact that the pilots appeared more than they did in the first volume.<br />All in all, the second volume is probably better than the first, mainly because it managed to establish the pace and sense of purpose the manga series is trying to create. And, as before for me, the Domon comics at the end of the volume were just as hilarious. By now, I can safely say that they are like a satire of the anime (not the manga, for some scenes satired in the Domon strips aren't in the manga) and they satirize probably some of the things that are living trademarks of &quot;Gundam Wing.&quot;<br />In the end, the second volume redeems any lingering doubts the first volume might've created. However, since the manga didn't stay true to the anime, I can't give it the highest rating of five stars. Again, I recommend this series to fans of the anime who don't mind leaving out the series' complex storyline.<br />PS -- For those who have bought &quot;The Art of Gundam Wing&quot;, look out for the artwork at the back of this volume.	2001-09-02

I'll try to write a review that really reviews this book.<br />First of all, I do not recommend this book to die-hard fans of the anime, as they will definately be offended by it. Also I don't recommend it to those unfamilar with the anime, for this book will undoubtedly confuse them. In both cases, how? Compared to the show, this manga is a lot more fast-paced and cuts out many plot pieces that liven, sometimes even define, the anime. The characters are sometimes a little &quot;distorted&quot; and have little chance for character development, and the dialogue at times can be weak. And depending on your tastes, the way the sound effects are sounded might seem really stupid (&quot;Step Step&quot;, &quot;Turn&quot;, &quot;Rage&quot;).<br />But it does have its high points. The Gundams themselves are drawn rather nicely, the plot is easy to follow and understand if you know the series pretty well, and unlike American comic strips (that I know of, at least), frames sometimes &quot;blend&quot; into each other instead of remain static rows of art panels (&quot;Inu-Yasha&quot; is a perfect example of this).<br />But we always have to return to the story's fast pace, which will either be loved or loathed. To me, however, I feel this story is targeted to a reader who wants to enter the Gundam universe without having to watch all 49 episodes and thus the complex plot. This book can leave many parts up to the reader's imagination, which I think is nice. Of course, a complete series manga would've have hurt, but that's a different story.<br />All in all, the actual comic is good but not great. So why did I give it four stars? The &quot;Domon&quot; strips in the back of the volume! Whether they're funny or not depends on your own personal humor, but for me they were absolutely hilarious! If the comic eventually becomes boring, these will most likely entertain you long afterwards!<br />Luckily for us Americans, this comic wasn't made especially for America; Japan got this manga as well (in Japanese, of course), so we weren't cheated out of a &quot;real&quot; Gundam manga. While this comic is decent, there are better, more fulfilling manga series out there (&quot;Inu-Yasha&quot;, &quot;Fushigi Yuugi&quot;, &quot;X/1999&quot;, and &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot; are good examples). In the end, I recommend this to Gundam fans who want to relive this classic series without worrying too much about its complex story. Whether or not you'll like this mange is all up to you, though.	2001-08-25
