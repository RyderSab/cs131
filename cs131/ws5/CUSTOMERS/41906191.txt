Well, she isn't quite dead...not yet, anyway. She flops around a bit, getting Dr. Linton blood-spattered and whatnot, but she eventually dies. Either in situ, or at the hospital, I can't quite remember, having read this book about a year ago. The dead, blind professor (who is only the first victim in a string of bodies this twisted freak leaves in his wake) happened to be the sister of Lena Adams who is an employee (police officer/detective) of the local police force. The police force of which Dr. Linton's ex-husband, Jeffery, is the Chief. The plot is set at a break-your-neck speed, the violence, while at an all-time high, is in no way gratuitous. Those few who've given this positively brilliant book less than its most deserving 5 stars seemed to have a problem, most of all, with the violence and the horrendous crimes against women. Well, nobody ever said serial killers were good guys, did they? Even Lena can't escape the viciousness of this horrid foe. He kidnaps her and nails her to the floor (yes, I said nailed, as in \\"a hammer and...\\") and rapes her repeatedly over a course of several days, though thankfully she survives and helps apprehend the sicko. He has an affinity for ripping out the teeth of his female victims (without the numbing effects of lidocaine or epinephrine, I assure you) to \\"rape their faces.\\" He is, as I said above, most certainly NOT a good guy. But he gets his just desserts in the end. And they are AWFULLY sweet. (The killer is, by the way, someone whom you'd never expect when his identity is finally revealed.) Oh, yes, this, Ms. Slaughter's first effort, is, in short, superb. I am writing a novel myself (mystery/serial killer-thriller) and it is from Ms. Slaughter's brilliant and \\"indelible\\" books (yes, I used the pun on purpose) that I learned how to put my main characters through absolute hell and pull them through it. Applaud Ms. Slaughter, for she certainly deserves your most fervent praises.	2004-12-22

I know I'm loving it now...Camille Minichino has created in Gloria Lamerino, a semiretired physicist, a highly likeable sleuth, giving her a lot of character and heart in her first outing (which is hard to do) in \\"The Hydrogen Murder\\". Eric Bensen, another physicist, is murdered, shot to death, in his dreary little laboratory. He was heading experiments into turning hydrogen into a metal, which would mean millions for a lot of people. When he started hinting at discrepancies in his team's data, he was promptly put out of business. Enter Gloria Lamerino, hired on as a professional by the sexy Matt Genarro to help weed out the killer and to explain the hard stuff to him. Minichino explains this physicist stuff in terms that the average layperson can understand and she doesn't do it condescendingly, either. She does it in a helpful, teacher-to-student kind of way. Thanks, Miss Minichino, and don't stop till you've covered all the elements! <br /> <br />	2004-11-16

Slaughter's career, I guess one could say, is still in it's childhood, if not infancy, but with this book she's had quite a growth spurt. In this, there are a rash of \\"suicides\\" on Grant Tech's campus. Dr. Sara Linton and her ex-husband Chief of Police Jeffrey Tolliver investigate. Meanwhile, ex-Detective Lena Adams, now campus security guard, becomes involved with a sexy, if not completely dangerous, ex-skinhead. Their relationship seems to thrive on violence and blood. Lena is rather self-destructive in this edition to Slaughter's Grant County series. It's as though she's having a regress of her healing after being brutally raped and nearly killed. Slaughter's plotting is brilliant and will take your head off like a shotgun blast. It is her plotting, more than her actual of style of writing, that is so acute and breathtaking. I love Karin Slaughter's books and will continue with \\"Indelible\\" and \\"Faithless\\".	2004-10-26

Lawrence Sanders' first Archibald McNally novel is much like Arhcy's mother, pleasingly plump and full of delight! Archy is part of McNally & Son Attorney-At-Law, notice the word 'attorney' is singular, not plural. That's because Archy is not a lawyer, though he did go to law school. But he got kicked out. We won't go into that unpleastantness, however. <BR>Dear, dear Archy heads a department of his father's firm called \\"Discreet Inquiries\\", he heads it because he's the only person in that particular department.  Archy is asked to make some \\"discreet inquiries\\" into the disappearance in rich-and-randy Lady Cynthia Horowitz's valuable Inverted Jenny stamps. They could be worth upwards of a cool half a mil. Archy has several suspects, including but not limited to, the Smythes (whom are Lady C's son and wife), Lacy C's daughter Gina Stanescu, including Lady C's other son and wife. And her dear friend the very much gay Angus Wolfson, Lady C's chaffeur and and his girlfriend. But more and more questions arise, like: why is Lady C costantly leaving in her bronze-colored Jag and not telling her social secretary where she's going? Is Wolfson and Lady C's chaffeur having an affair? And what about Archy's personal life? Will the beautiful and astute Jennifer Towley go back to her husband or stick with Archy?

Brilliance is the only to describe France thriller writer Brigitte Aubert's English debut, &quot;Death From the Woods&quot; about blind, quadripalegic, mute Elise Andrioli. You're thinking, how and the hell could such a disabled woman blink, much less solve a slew of child murders? With her all-encompassing hope of being able to move again, and her sardonic wit. Elise lives with Yvette, her nursemaid and general caregiver. One day Yvette decides to take Elise with her to the market. She parks Elise under an oak tree, and goes on about her shopping. A little girl Elise learns is named Virginie comes up to Elise and asks if perhaps Elise would like hear a story? Elise can't move anything but an index finger, so she raises it to signal, yes, she would like to hear a story. It sure beats sitting there, doing her impersonation of a sack of potatoes in a wheelchair (her words, not mine). So Virginie begins telling Elise the story of Death From the Woods. Death comes from the Woods and strangles pretty little boys. Elise is terrified, thinking maybe Virginie is just a bit on nutty side, when she hears that another little boy has been killed. Elise is then thrown into an investigation, wheelchair and all, meeting a phony cop, Yssart, and another cop Gassinet. If you aren't fluent in French, a few of the names like Boissy and Migoin might throw you a little, but don't let that stop you. This book is too good to pass up.	2004-03-14

I must disagree, once again. Let us review what I've said earlier in other CHC reviews. <br />CHC is much like Agatha Christie inasmuch as Christie's writing was, like CHC's, formulaic and light on character development, high on plotting. CHC's plotting is ingenious. Regan Reilly is a likeable character, even if she isn't very well drawn. CHC is not trying to be James Lee Burke or Sharyn McCrumb or Sue Grafton who are very high on character development. No, CHC, I believe, doesn't want anything to take away from her story. She's telling a great one in &quot;Iced&quot;. <br />In this wonderful suspense tale, Regan Reilly and her mother Nora Regan Reilly and her father Luke Reilly are all in Aspen, Colorado with some friends. They are there to enjoy the skiing and the fine dining and help Regan's friend Louis open up the Silver Mine Inn. Several valuable paintings are being swiped by who people think is Eben Bean, an ex-jewel thief. When in reality Eben has been kidnapped by the real thieves who themselves are being watched by &quot;the Coyote&quot;, a expert art thief. There are enough twists in here to keep you guessing and enough characters so you don't get bored. Snap up a copy of CHC's &quot;Iced&quot;, curl up under the covers at night or lounge on the couch during the day and go to Aspen with Regan.	2004-03-09

She's penned another Regan Reilly mystery that had me up until my eyes began watering because I was so tired. But &quot;Fleeced&quot; seemed to be Krazy Glue'd to my hands. I read this in two settings. I must once again compare Carol with Agatha Christie, for the sole purpose of informing readers just how tight and crisp Clark's plots are. She sets you up, as always, with Regan Reilly being with her mother and father, or her boyfriend, Jack &quot;No-Relation&quot; Reilly. They might be going to an event together, they might be on vacation, or whatnot. But murder and danger seem to follow poor Regan wherever she goes. And Agatha Christie is so much the same way. Hercule and Miss Marple always seemed to be pleasant enough in the beginning of a new book or story, that is until a corpse fell into their respective laps. I just love Carol Higgins Clark's Regan Reilly series! She makes those convoluted, difficult plots seem so easy to create!	2004-02-27

Let us consider for a moment a woman writer--a woman mystery writer--whose books are outsold only by the bible. That's right, Agatha Christie. Let us compare the two. What was AC best known for? Well, it sure as hell wasn't character development. You couldn't tell Poirot from Miss Marple if one of them didn't have a yin and the other a yang. Giving them quirks is not character development. No, AC was best known for...what? Not character development, that's for damn sure. Not poetic, beautiful writing. As you can see, most of her books are slim, hard little gems that are short, fun reads. *Gasps* Much like CHC! What a coincidence! Dame Agatha Christie was known for (drumroll please) ingenious plotting!! Much like in Carol Higgins Clark's &quot;Decked&quot;. She inherited this from her mother. <BR>Let's have an overview, shall we? <br />CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: neither CHC or AC<br />GREAT, POETIC WRITING: neither CHC or AC<BR>PLOT DEVELOPMENT: both CHC and AC<BR>INGENIOUS PLOTTING: both CHC and AC<br />Am I the only one who sees a pattern evolving here? I thought so. You see, if we adore Agatha Christie because of her deviously simple mysterious plots, then must we not love Carol Higgins Clark for the same reason?? Of course! So, I must ask, if, as writers, Agatha Christie and Carol Higgins Clark are so similar in their plotting and writing, then why the horrible reviews of CHC and fantastic reviews of AC? Think on it a bit. I'm sure it will come to you...	2004-02-26

I believed this book to be one of the best mysteries I've ever read. And I've read neary 300, and I think I'd know a lemon when I spotted one. CHC keeps the suspense moving right along, the story is...usnagged, unsnared, unhitched, hurtles along the pages like a wildfire. Okay, so the ending is just a tad too pat, a tad too perfect, but it's still a great novel. She writes like her mother, in the same classy, almost elegant style. I, personally, think CHC is a much better novelist than actress. Do yourself a good deed and pick up a paperback copy of &quot;Snagged&quot;. You'll be sure to enjoy it.	2004-02-15

Granted, it's Aterovis's first, but that doesn't make it any less terrible. Thomas Harris penned a book that will go down in history on his second attempt. \\"Bleeding Hearts\\" is amateurish at best, pathetic at worst. The book revolves around Killian Travers Kendall, a boy of 16 who, in a matter of days, not weeks, but DAYS, discovers he's gay, goes through boyfriends like Kleenex, has several of his friends murdered, and cries nearly enough to dehydrate himself. The writing is all over the page, loose. I felt as if I was trying to read a pageful of worms wriggling all over the page. I have read nearly 300 mysteries and thrillers, including Fred Hunter, Michael Craft, Lev Raphael, Mark Richard Zubro, Krandall Kraus, and several other men and women who write \\"gay mysteries\\", so I like to believe that I know what I'm talking about when I write a review on one. Josh Aterovis should seriously consider going into a different profession. Do yourself a favor, if you want a nice gay mystery, read Richard Stevenson or Fred Hunter, or Mark Richard Zubro. Leave Killian with his black Beetle Bug and Asher.	2004-02-14

I, personally, would give this book 6 stars if I could. This was one of the best thriller novels I've ever read--ever.  And I've read over 280 mysteries and thrillers, including nearly all of John Grisham's, Tami Hoag's, Sue Grafton, and the like, so I feel as if I have a certain sense of what is good and what is not. But I digress...<br />Attorney Mary Crow is quarry in this novel. Quarry plain and simple. It would be impossible to describe to you the level of tension behind the innocent-looking cover of this novel. Mary and two of her friends go for a camping trip in the Nantahala National Forest after Mary has just won a conviction against a very bad man in court. After Mary her her two friends get to Nantahala, violence erupts. A hideously ugly and filthy man beats and rapes Alex and leaves Mary's other friend for dead, after kidnapping Alex. Mary and her other friend go looking for Alex.<BR>Enter the rapist-murderer that Mary just battled in court.<BR>He begins pursuit of Mary in the Nantahala. So, not only does she have the vicious man who brutally raped and beat and kidnapped her friend, she also has another very dangerous man on her trail. This book is full of non-stop action, written by an incomparable writer who is not afraid to let her heroines get hurt. (She's kind of like Ridley Pearson or Tami Hoag in this regard). Unlike the romance novelist heroines who come out of the battle with nary a scratch marring their mooncalf features.<br />Read this book. It is incredible, astonishing, disturbing.	2004-01-07

You will find yourself having a white-knuckled grip on the book while holding it (that is if you can stop reading long enough for your right brain to make this little discovery).  <br />FBI Special Agent Pendergast makes another show in this novel, however without the sometimes dubious help of Bill Smithback.  Pendergast mysteriously appears in Medicine Creek, Kansas (like he appears everywhere).  There have been a series of grisly murders going on in this, small, dusty town.  The victims are mutilated and arranged in nauseating tableaus in the cornfields of which Medicine Creek seems to be full.  Pendergast is almost immediately cold-shouldered by the small town's constable, Sheriff Hazen.  But, as always, Pendergast prevails, hiring a teenage misfit as an escort whom you grow to love throughout the novel's spine-snapping pace.  The denouement, like always in the Douglas/Child novels is made up of near tediousness and maddening suspense deep under the town of Medicine Creek.  Buy this book and do yourself a favor.	2003-10-16

The first is that the beginning is rather tedious until Callahan finds the body of one Jordan Poole, the guy who was going to put a senior citizen hippy, Wuvvy, out of business by turning her adult toy store, YoYos, into a microbrewery called Blind Possum.  The book starts out with threatening weather that quickly and viciously turns into a tornado.  And Callahan, with her annoying habit of finding dead bodies, goes after her boyfriend's, Mac McAuliffe's, dog, Rufus. So there goes Callahan, running with a flashlight, through the driving rain and hellacious thunderstorm on her way to find Rufus.  She finds herself at YoYos, which is right beside her pal's, Hap's, bar, The Yacht Club.  The door to YoYos is open, so she goes in and finds Jordan Poole's body.<BR>    And that's all you're gettin'!<BR>    But I will tell you this: This adventure featuring cleaning whiz Callahan Garrity, ex-cop, sometimes P.I., is a romp that will leave you laughing, possibly crying.

US	41906191	R32VC67T4RXONI	0786889489	357238997	FLASHPOINT (Carlotta Carlyle Mysteries)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Another Gem In Carlotta's Collection	First of all let me say this: How anyone could possibly give this book, or any other Carlotta Carlyle mystery a bad review is so entirely beyond me. I think these people must be aliens from a distant and uncultured, illiterate planet, where they read the trash of such authors as William Faulkner that are supposed to be out-of-this-world brilliance. I think not.  <BR>This Carlotta Carlyle is not, in any way, bad or under-written. Barnes consistenly slams us with an enormously entertaining Carlotta novel.  And &quot;Flashpoint&quot; is no exception that literarily-gifted rule.<BR>Whenever I mention Linda Barnes to my friends or family, bringing up her mysteries in a conversation with my best friend's mother, I refer to her as my &quot;beloved&quot; Linda Barnes, same as authors like Joan Hess (only in reference to her Claire Malloy books since I loathe Arly Hanks), Sue Grafton, Janet Evanovich, and Mary Higgins Clark.  <BR>&quot;Flashpoint&quot; is no way a bad novel. Read this book, and all other Carlyle mysteries by Barnes. I believe that &quot;The Snake Tattoo&quot; was the first in this series.<br />~Steven Harvey	2001-12-25

The prose was loose, the chains of action were jerkily connected, the different scenes jerkily connected.  Many of us adamant fans of Koontz knows that he can do so very much better.  I do understand that this was written in Koontz's earlier years (1984), but that doesn't justify such uncharacteristically mediocrity that he puts in &quot;Darkfall&quot;. The plot simply was not believable, the ending was absolutely horrible, and even more unbelievable then the plot in its entirety.  The characters were as one-dimensional and cardboard as Danielle Steel's.  The best, most gripping parts of this novel were those of which Penny were narrating, and Penny was an 11-year-old girl. And I never read the infamous &quot;scariest-ever&quot; chase scene at the end. Did I miss something?  And, I've said this before, but it bears repeating: The ending was so terribly written. I am absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, sure that this was written by a Koontz ghostwriter, which, I believe is a deceitful act used by writers when they're too lazy to pen a book themselves. The style in this book was so extremely unlike any Koontz novel I've ever read that that's what kept me reading it.  That sheer fact that it was so extremely unlike Koontz.  The only way I'd suggest this book to anyone is for comparison and experimentation reasons only.  Experimenting the comparisons between say Koontz's &quot;The Door to December&quot; and &quot;Darkfall&quot; or between &quot;Tick Tock&quot; and &quot;Darkfall&quot;. Because, in my long-running fanship of Mr. Koontz, I believe that &quot;Tick Tock&quot; was his best novel ever. And I wish he'd go back to writing brain-shredding, spine-snapping suspenseful horror like &quot;Tick Tock&quot; and lay off the softer side of his genius with stuff like &quot;False Memory&quot; and the Christopher Snow mystery fluff. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why &quot;Darkfall&quot; is a disappointment fromsuch a master like Koontz.<br />~Steven Harvey	2001-12-25
US	41906191	R3D5XBF19LEONB	0679751823	122238069	Answered Prayers	Books	5	60	76	N	N	Unanswered	First of all, let me say this: I am a Truman Capote fanatic, an absolute Truman Capote maniac.  I read &quot;Answered Prayers&quot; when I was in the 11th grade, and I was so angry that he died before he could finish it. I devour Capote's work as though it were an edible delicacy, or as though it were a lunar eclipse, something that is so incredibly rare, something to be cherished by all.  I love &quot;Answered Prayers&quot; because it is like a man spilling secrets about his high-class, muckety-muck friends. Damaging secrets, secrets that we all knew they would refute, though we knew they were true.  Secrets like Montgomery Clift's homosexuality.  This book was rather vulgar, depicting Capote's wilder side, the Capote side that rages like a forest fire, rages unchecked.  Read this book, do yourself a favor, read this book.<br />~Steven Harvey	2001-12-24
US	41906191	RG020PKOADIU0	034538430X	199284738	Ticktock	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Dean Koontz At His Absolute Terrifying Greatest	There is only one author that I can think of that freezes your blood and makes you feel as though your heart as actually stopped.  His name is Dean Koontz, and with &quot;Ticktock&quot;, these feelings are quite real.  I first read this book when I was about 14. At that age I was obsessed with ordering books from Double Day, and as I penned in the number for Dean Koontz's &quot;Ticktock&quot;, I never knew I would be taken on a ride on a rain-heavy, lightning-sticken night.  This is THE best Dean Koontz. If you want to know the two best Dean Koontz books...They are &quot;Ticktock&quot; and &quot;The Door to December&quot;.	2001-12-22
US	41906191	R1KDLNVL14WW89	0060926864	533849003	Mysterious Skin: A Novel	Books	5	6	9	N	N	Beauty At Its Most Anguished, Simplisticly Intricate	Scott Heim is one of the best authors I've read in a long time. He is up on a pedestal with the likes of Truman Capote.  His debut novel &quot;Mysterious Skin&quot; is about Neil and Brian, two gay boys, who through trials and tribulations, discover who they are, and what they are.  There just aren't any adequate words in the human language to describe Scott Heim's beautiful, haunting prose.  He is incredibly poetic, and the lives of Brian and Neil are so exqiusitely painful and achingly beautiful that it should drive you to tears, and if it doesn't, then check your chest cavity for a heart.  How anyone could possibly give this book a bad review is simply beyond me.  Just be forewarned: Do not read this book on a gray rainy day, while feeling dismal, or while using heavy machinery.  It is sure to depress, but make angry, and also begs for attention.<br />~Steven Harvey	2001-12-18
