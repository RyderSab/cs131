Confessions of a Street Addict really brings to light the career of James Cramer starting off as a struggling writer to successful hedge fund manager.<br /><br />I liked how Cramer didn't focus on just his success.  I really liked the beginning of the book that clearly showed Cramer's interest in the market, talking about the market and struggling as a writer in southern California.  Cramer's story is inspiring and not sugar coated.  As he eventually finds his way, he is offerred a more lucrative career path in New York and that eventually leads him to his stock market business where he meets his wife.<br /><br />I liked how Cramer talked about how rough it was trying to get started in the business, how to succeed and how crule the reality of it was.  Cramer doesn't wave any flags for Wall Street and doesn't make it sound like it's an easy, forgiving world out there.  Cramer's story about his sruggles with TheStreet.com, his hedge fund, managing people, family and the roar of trading in the 90's really comes to life in this book.<br /><br />I recommend this book because Cramer tells it like it is.  He doesn't praise himself, he doesn't sugar coat and it was very intriguing reading.	2005-10-12

It covers her involvement from Confederate early marches into Gettysburg to the aftermath of the battle.  Tillie explains how she reacted to various events that unfolded in front of her and how she helped tend to wounded soldiers. She doesn't ever get too detailed as to the horrors she witnessed although I could get a good sense of the enviroment she was in as she explains her feelings quite well.  Tillie does an excellent job giving us a resource for valuable information as to how locations on the field appeared in 1863 be it a home, road or situation happening upon the fields.  Tillie's writing is priceless and really conveys civilian perspective to the horrors witnessed at Gettysburg.  This is a great book for those seeking civilian commentary on Gettysburg.	2005-05-17

O'Reilly brings the reader to the later part of 1862 by carefully explaining just why this battle was started and how it unfolded.  O'Reilly explains how the Lincoln administration was eager for a victory and also quite bold in their plan to capture Richmond.  The politics and situation that faced the Army of the Potomac was clearly identified early on.  O'Reilly covered every aspect of the beginning of the battle, be it the desperate crossing of the Rappahannock, Confederate defensive works and just how the two armies became engaged.  I liked how O'Reilly quoted the private soldier accounts through the beginning, landing of Fredericksburg, taking of the city and eventually the assaults upon Prosect Hill and Mayres Heights.<br /><br />O'Reilly's description of the battle from both Union and Confederate views was extraordinary.  The carnage of battle was complete and it truly explained just how futile and reckless the Battle of Fredericksburg was.  O'Reilly also brought forth how generals failed or worked successfully with one another that added a lot of weight to this great book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this thorough study of this great battle. It is an impressive book that defines every moment and situation with excellent writing.	2005-01-06

Popularized and quoted often in Ken Burn's Civil War series on PBS, Rhodes' book about his life as a soldier come to life.  Rhodes brings the excitement and patriotic fervor of being a new recruit in the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry early in the war.  This patriotic spirit never dies through out his writing.  Many times he writes about the daily hardships such as bad weather, sickness and death while always falling back on the duty to ones country and the saving of the union.  Rhodes' duty carries him many engagements where death lingers around every corner.  Battles such as Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg and Gettysburg are just a few that this man witnessed and wrote about firsthand.  Rhodes' was really an ideal soldier and loved the life.  He started the war as a private and by the end of it was a colonel.  Many people would benefit from reading this book be it a historian or beginner looking to further understand soldier life in the Civil War.	2004-11-25

Martin has taken the first day at Gettysburg and offered an absolute, extensive and highly detailed study of the events.  Martin rarely misses a regiment's detailed movement that can often be over looked in books that consider only the first day of battle at Gettysburg.  It was interesting reading about the 1st Corps movements with General Reynolds and what I liked about Martin's book, was that he was fair and brought myths or otherwise cloudy possibilities to better reasonable conclusion.  Events such as where Cavalry was positioned, the death of General Reynolds and even Slocum's slow cautious movements towards Gettysburg where very thorough.  Martin also considers the time elements as well.  He brings in various witness accounts and has well over 100 pages in references to back up his points.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book for those seeking a very deep understanding of the events on July 1st at Gettysburg.   This book may be too deep for novices or people just starting to read about the battle.	2004-10-20

Author William Klingman has written an excellent book about Lincoln's development and issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.  Klingman brings forward the birth of the concept and how Lincoln faced so much aversion to its release.  The book clearly illustrates how difficult such a task was to complete it and also how well it was received.<br /><br />Besides the opposition in the South, Northern opposition towards the war and constant defeats were making many question Lincoln's ability to be the President.  Faced with horrible Union defeats and lackluster leadership Lincoln understands that in order to defeat the Confederacy there has to be considered the issue of freeing the slaves for political and moral reasons.  Through out the book, the opposition from both Republican, Democratic and various groups are clearly defined while Lincoln debates within himself as to what is the proper procedure is to handling the freeing of slaves.<br /><br />It was very interesting to read about the many variables and choices Lincoln had to make while fighting multiple political battles and growing unrest in the northern states.  Eventually Lincoln does get the proclamation passed and part of the book describes in detail just how this new era unfolds and how blacks become soldiers and deal with being free.<br /><br />To understand Lincoln, the political unrest of the time and also the birth and issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, I highly recommend this book.  Klingman writes and chronologically carries the book very well.	2004-10-03

Being a fan of both battles I felt I owed it to myself to finally read this book.  I was skeptical at first, although I was after the opinion and personal insight from Doubleday.  I was disappointed after several pages to see that what I was reading was more so a quick history or study of the battles instead of insight from Doubleday himself.  Now, at times Doubleday did offer his opinion or toughts about a particular movement or fight, but rarely did talk about his own personal involvement.  This is what I was hoping to read and found myself reading a quick rundown of events concerning these two famous battles.  Seldom did Doubleday offer what he was thinking or desired to explain his reasons for his actions.  Doubleday is vague at times and skips key elements occasionally to make this book appear quite short of information.  For anyone looking to understand the battles, I suggest authors like Stephen Sears, James McPherson or Harry Pfanz.  I can't recommend this book because Doubleday is very brief and at the same time rarely brings in his insight to make this book interesting.	2004-04-26

Being a fan of Stephen Sears I was anxious to get my hands on this book as I have read many others of his. Sears style is clear, concise and interesting.  Covering the great battle, Sears tackles a lot of ground from Lee's desires to take the war north of Virginia,  Stuart's Cavalry operations, Union leadership, Confederate and Union positions, early marches and finally the battle itself.  Sears always brings his words to life and this book is a great example of that. I liked reading about Lee's intentions as to why to press into Pennsylvania, Union leadership and Longstreet's approach to handling Lee's orders.  These were just a few of the many great chapters inside this informative and entertaining book about the Battle of Gettysburg. 5 STARS!!!	2004-04-16

I ask myself, \\"How can I rank a diary?\\".  I decided to rank this diary in comparison to other diaries I have read and decided it was worth three stars instead of five.  Wiley's writing is at times quite brief, spelling, grammar, punctuation and detail fall short in comparison to other soldier accounts.  Though valuable in understanding soldier thought and lifestyle, Wiley's descriptions are vague, hard to follow and at times the book feels sluggish.  Author Terrence Winschel does help out Wiley's writing by prepping the reader for various chapters and the references sometimes to clear up some confusion as to time, place or subject matter.  Wiley's diary follows him from his muster into service for the 77th Illinois until his final discharge 3 years later in 1865.  Wiley suffers from health problems through out the book and misses some battles, is involved in skirmishes, the Vicksburg Campaign and many other campaigns through out Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee.  His battle descriptions are quite vague and some of the soldier living details I was hoping to read about where not present.  Overall, I have read better books on the subject although I have to treasure the opportunity to be able to read the book as it does capture the soldier life at times and brings more life to understanding bits and pieces of soldering in the western theatre.	2004-03-08

This book carries a similar format to books that look at the &quot;hows&quot; and &quot;whys&quot; of a battle, but instead follows popular events in the Civil War.  Featuring and all-star cast of writers such as Gallagher and Sears, the book covers a variety of topics concerning subjects like Lee, Jackson, Grant, Vicksburg, Forrest at Fort Pillow, Union prisons, Sherman, Sheridan and many others.  I have to admit the lack of references was disappointing as at times writer opinion versus fact were questionable.  A majority of the chapters did offer interesting insight and tried to look at either popular misconceptions or myths surrounding the subjects.  There is over 500 pages of material here that offer the advanced student of the Civil War possible new insight to events.  I couldn't recommend this book to novice readers as a majority of the topics seem to be written in the assumption of past reader knowledge.	2004-02-19

Garry Fisher has put together a quick study of the Civil War soldier diet. It features chapters that focus on feeding the armies, recipes, camp songs derived from food and passing time in camp.  Fisher brings to light the popular recipes commonly used by soldiers north or south.  Recipes for cooking with hardtack, salt pork, corn bread and beef, give fascinating insight into these horrible foods soldiers were faced with eating.  I recommend this book to anyone looking to get basic, popular camp recipes for campaign-style eating.  Reenactors looking to improve their impression would benefit greatly by reading this informative, yet sometimes humorous book that captures the daily diet of a Civil War soldier. 5 STARS!	2004-02-16

William McCarter's book is quite an interesting tale of his involvment as a private for the famous Irish Brigade.  McCarter's vivid descriptions of soldier life, marching, camping, facing cold weather, hard living and the Battle of Fredericksburg was very well done.  McCarter missed Antietam although his regiment did face the Confederates at the heights of Fredericksburg.  McCarter tells such a facinating, informative, sad, happy, yet chilling story at times during his soldier career that it was hard to put this book down.  His vivid story of Fredericksburg and how the brigade battled it out, how he was injured and how he escaped death while suffering upon the battlefield was certainly the best part of the book.  I wish more soldier accounts were written as well as this one as this book is one of the better books I've read that tells a soldier's story.  5 STARS!	2004-02-11

Author Alan Nolan has brought the story of the Iron Brigade to life in this excellent study of this famous group of hard fighting midwesterners.  Nolan's information is valuable and everything is backed by references.  Nolan's style is concise.  It was nice that he didn't dwell on subjects like battles or politics not involving the Iron Brigade.  He kept the book's chapters flowing and informative.  He kept biographies short while the movements and changes in command structure through out the book were covered very well.  The fighting at Gettysburg was probably the best coverage and most descriptive although it was most fitting considering it was the brigade's crescendo in battle.  Overall, Nolan's book is a valuable tool, reference and history of the Iron Brigade that many people could benefit from reading.  5 STARS!	2004-02-03

Hitchcock, 21st Massachusetts Infantry	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Another great look from the soldier's perspective!	I wish there were more diaries from soldiers written as well as this one.  Hitchcock had a flair for writing and describing his events as a soldier very well.  Hitchcock diary takes the reader on a long journey from enlisting in summer of 1862 to his final discharge in December of 1864.  Throughout the journey Hitchcock brings to life the daily soldier grind, picket duty, camp life, fighting, being captured and the tough life of being a prisoner at Andersonville.  I found the several chapters on Andersonville to be the most interesting in the book as it acts as a great resource of information for daily life at the prison.  Hitchcock's daily diary writing is usually quite short and he doesn't write long narratives as compared to other soldier accounts.  Sometimes I had wished he had written more details on the fighting, although his explanations of the fighting during the battle of Cold Harbor were very descriptive and I could easily vision the horrors.  In other situations, Hitchcock was brief about his experiences at Fredericksburg in 1862 although he didn't see much fighting there. His best work on that subject came about from descriptions of the city and the hardships endured there.  Overall, this book is an excellent source of information for those seeking insight about soldier life in the Civil War and books like this are priceless.	2004-01-23

Grant	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Another look from the top of command:	Insight is key to this book written by Grant from basically his death bed.  What we learn from Grant in this book gives us an opportunity to understand his intentions, strategies and how he worked with people.  Grant tries to be very fair in his writing that covers his early days as a colonel to full-fledged commander of the US Army.  His style is basic and easy to understand.  At times the book feels like he is giving a history lesson about the war and sometimes is vague about triumphs or failures.  I was looking forward to reading about Grant's work with the battle of Cold Harbor and he was completely brief in this book considering it was a major conflict.  But, this was Grant's choice to write and memoir depth is subject to author decision.  Grant does pack a lot of information in and also has interesting coverage in regards to Lee's surrender.  Anyone studying Grant or looking for further insight owes it to themselves to consider reading this book.	2004-01-04

Davis has assembled a great amount of information on the Battle of Bull Run and put it together and a concise and easy to read format.  Davis investigates the early generalship of both armies coming to grips with a divided nation and how each side will defend itself.  The birth of Union and Confederate high command struggles early to define their strategies.  Davis brings such issues to life as the very &quot;green&quot; Union and Confederate armies clash in and around Manassas.  I liked how Davis built the climax of the battle together and how he wrote about the various brigades and regiments formed or that were directed as the birth of the first major battle formed.  During the fighting Davis points out key areas of fighting in the short terrain near Bull Run and how brigades held together or either fall apart.  It was interesting to read about how Davis downplayed the more popular events of the battle such as the myths surrounding the naming of Stonewall Jackson, or how the Washington's social elite were chased while being overwhelmed by a retreating Union army. Davis focused on the battle at hand while his references back up commentary, or soldier accounts.  For anyone looking to understand the first major battle of the Civil War, they owe it to themselves to read this book!	2003-11-07

It is difficult to rate a book by 5 Stars or less when it is someone's diary.  The book covers Newton's journey from enlistment in 1861 to final discharge in 1865.  It is a rather quick read of his letters sent home although it covers the monthly grind of soldiering in the 14th Wisconsin.  Newton skips many descriptions of horrific content in his letters home that was common back then and manages to keep them clean.  His hardships endured through out the many years of soldiering are toned down in his writing.  Perhaps, like other soldiers, he didn't want family to worry at home.  His attitude towards black soldiers brings about expression that by today's standards would be considered racist.  His letters do bring to light the emotion and desire to return home and also helps illustrate the psychological profiles of soldiers close to him.  You can never go wrong studying letters from the Civil War as they always help bring new life to the realities of the conflict.  This book certainly can bring new insight and thought to anyone looking understand more about soldiering during the Civil War.	2003-10-21

Waugh brings the reader to the front lines of struggle faced by the Lincoln administration and various political parties looking to cause unrest and hinder Lincoln's chances at reelection.  The book also looks at many players involved in either helping Lincoln or destroying his chances.  As the book progresses it uncovers odd political gain of many such as radicals trying anything to ruin Lincoln's chances while hysteria and hype flow through the papers.

Seldom do we get a chance to read about civilians and their stories through out the Antietam Campaign. This book gives us a great look at just what the hardships Maryland civilians had to endure.  Authors Kathleen Ernst and Ted Alexander have asembled an interesting book that features Confederate and Union early concentrations, skirmishes and battles around the Sharpsburg and Frederick areas that bring to life civilian response.  Popular families such as the Prys, Pipers and Millers living in the area of Sharpsburg during the battle are covered along with many others that explain the ordeals and horrors these families faced while war was at their doorstep.  Interesting and facinating the text explains the unknown hardships that civilians had to face while battles took place and how also many tried to survive after the bloody engagements.  One can not just read about the battle and get a full perspective on the campaign without considering reading about the civilians and I highly recommend this book! 5 STARS!	2003-08-30

Catton covers the army from late 1863 to Lee's final surrender in April of 1865.  Like his other two books, Catton is full of information and the book it quite entertaining to read as Catton's style is descriptive, but gets to the point.  Catton covers the introduction of Grant and how the army changes command structure and the pursuit of Lee is pressed.  Battle coverage of the Wilderness Campaign, Spottsylvania, and Petersburg was very interesting. Catton's political coverage of the Lincoln administration helped bolster the book to add further insight. I had wished Catton had covered more of the Cold Harbor battle although his coverage of Sheridan's Cavalry operations was fantastic.

Stars In Their Courses is an excellent book covering the Gettysburg Campaign.  Taken completely from Foote's Civil War Trilogy, the book presents a balanced view of the battle.  Foote's writing is always easy to read and understand and at times brief in coverage.  For a reader looking for great information I would suggest reading a book devoted to a particular day of fighting during the campaign as this book covers the basics and seldom dives into any hour-by-hour detail.  For the advanced historian it may seem a bit too brief but for the novice Civil War reader it is an excellent book.  Foote likes to present the battle from both sides of the army and explain Lee's and Meade's thoughts or strategies that help explain the how the battle and final outcome evolved.  Shelby Foote is probably one of the best authors on the subject and I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to gain further knowledge and insight into the Battle of Gettysburg.	2003-07-04

Hess adds quotes from soldiers that enhance the chapters and bring things to a closer personal level.  Hess also explains how soldiers coped after the war and how they filtered back into society.  This an excellent book that gets into the psychological mind set of the Union soldier and is not a book like Hardtack Coffee that covers more material topics.

This book by Bruce Catton follows Volume 1 in his famous Civil War Trilogy covering the Army of the Potomac.  In this well written text, Catton covers the footsteps of the army dealing with the loss at Fredericksburg, following Burnside, then Hooker, Chancellorsville and then finally Gettysburg.  Catton isn't truly descriptive of the battles and quickly covers the basics, though Catton loves to present the politics involving Union leadership and basically the war itself.  While covering the end of 1862 and a majority of 1863, Catton's coverage brings the readers insight to popular sentiment, northern industrialization, the struggles facing the Lincoln administration, the perils of war and much more. Catton never dwells too long a subject and keeps things moving while bringing a bit of humor to uncommon situations or oddities of the war.  Catton's books are never boring and either is this one.

Being the first book in a trilogy Catton focuses on early leadership, high morale, Washington politics and the creation of McClellan as the leader of the Army of the Potomac.  Catton has brought to life the trials and hardships that the army suffered and endured during 1861 and 1862.  In this text, Catton reveals Lincoln's desires for quick resolution while leadership fails or doesn't take advantage of manpower to end the war.  In a constant struggle to find the right general McClellan appears to be the right person for the job although Republicans in the Whitehouse fear he may not have the heart for it as his believed to be a solid democrat, rather over cautious, misinformed and downright treasonous.  Catton follows the army chronologically and brings the fighting to the forefront from Manassas to Antietam.  With this we get great insight as to McClellan's motives and conflicts that express the problems of the army during the early days of the war.	2003-05-15

It is difficult finding books that cover single regiments with solid information that only pertains to the unit itself sometimes.  Author Craig Dunn has put together a very comprehensive book that covers the birth of the 19th Indiana to final muster in 1865.  I liked the fact that Dunn didn't dwell on only officers but brought the private soldier to life as short biographies and the details of their involvement were written about.  Dunn covers early exhaustive marches, campaigns, camp life, politics and explains the many personalities within the 19th.  Dunn backs his material up well with references and also many statistics are added that enhance this book tremendously.  This book serves as a great resource tool in learning about the hard fighting 19th and I recommend it to many interested in learning about the tough regiment of the famous Iron Brigade.	2003-05-03

McPherson places the reader in 1862 and covers the struggles of the Union grasping with the possibilities that Southern independence may be gained. From various Union battle losses and growing disdain for Lincoln and his department, McPherson covers these ideas and concepts that are becoming an ever-growing concern in the North.  McPherson discusses how the Confederacy was winning battles and lowering Northern morale while covering Lee's reasons for invading Maryland and just how much the Union had to lose if Lee were to be successful in the North.  McPherson brings to light the watchful eyes of Britain and France as they determine who to favor if the South were continue their successes and pressure Washington.  As this pressure mounts McPherson covers Lincoln's bold moves and reasons for bringing forth the Emancipation Proclamation and how the Battle of Antietam helped pave the way for its issuance.  One chapter is actually devoted to the battle while others bring forth General McClellan's slow and cautious approach to war.  Frustrations continue to grow within the Lincoln party before and after the battle while political unrest and turmoil haunt the Republicans' view of the future.  This book brings a lot of these elements together. It shows how crucial this battle was for paving the way to show the Northern people that the Union wasn't fighting in vain and also that slavery had to be abolished. By doing this it presented a higher purpose for keeping the war effort intact and to also win the favor of Britain and France.  I highly recommend this book to people that are looking to understand the political aspects of the war while also learning about Lincoln's reasonings for his actions.  This book does not cover the battle like traditional books about Antietam and would most likely be for those who have already read about the battle at one time or another.already read about the battle at one time or another.	2003-04-21

Being a fan of author Jeffrey Wert's work I didn't have to decide on whether or not to buy this book when I came across it.  Wert's writing flows well and he backs up quite a lot of his information with useful references as he has done in other books.  Wert has taken two of the more popular brigades of the Civil War and has followed their enlistment and organization in 1861 to final muster in 1865.  Wert documents each brigade's movements and battles while carefully explaining changes in command and regimental organization.  I found this book quite intriging as these famous brigades met each other in battle three times at such places as Brawner Farm, Antietam and Gettysburg.  Wert explains the battles quickly at times which was refreshing in cases where the brigades had little conflict or involvement.  In times of battle, Wert gets to the point of the fighting and doesn't dwell in huge detail as you may find in some books covering a certain campaign or battle.<br />What I did find a bit disappointing in this book was the fact that under the title it reads, &quot;The common soldiers of the Stonewall Brigade and the Iron Brigade&quot;.  I was under the impression that more soldier life would be covered instead of regiment movements or the following of commanders.  This book didn't quote too many soldiers or bring their diary writing as you may see in other books on soldiers.  Overall, Wert has taken a great amount of information and packed it into 319 pages of material.  Could more have been written? Perhaps, although the coverage was excellent and I can recommend this book to many who are seeking additional information regarding these famous and hard fighting brigades.	2003-04-16

Norton takes a look at both sides of the battle for Little Round Top and tries to give a fair and accurate account of what really happened.  Instead of offering his complete insight, he paraphrases from popular figures of those involved in the confict such as Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, Colonel Strong Vincent, Colonel Oates, General Law, General Sykes, General Barnes and a host of others.  This book is basically a collage of personal accounts summarized and paraphrased into almost a confusing format.  Norton doesn't follow a easy format to his book and often left me confused on whether or not he was talking about the battle himself or another person was.  Besides the confusing style, I would have to say that the book did offer some interesting insight as to what happened from a variety of key people.  It was interesting to read about what one Confederate colonel wrote about a particular movement while comparing that to what a Union colonel wrote.  Norton had a great idea with this book but it really left me confused because nothing flowed or connected in the writing at times.  I couldn't recommend this book to many unless they wanted a quick source of paraphrased personal accounts.  I was disappointed in not getting more information on Colonel Chamberlain or his opinions of what really happened.	2003-04-08

Author James Robertson has put together a very interesting book that considers many popular aspects of soldiering in the Civil War.  Robertson hits strong topics such as enlisting, camp life, battle, prisons, religion, relationships, family, death and valor.  This insightful information is backed by reference, great writing and also some humorous situations that Robertson assembles.  This book was a pleasure to read and at times very educational.  For the advanced historian, it may be a bit too generalized although a person with some basic knowledge of the war could benefit a great amount.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking to understand the common soldier of the Civil War and looking to gain further insight.	2003-04-01

After reading this book it is easy to understand the tremendous task in gathering the amount of information author Alfred Jay Bollet had to assemble on the subject.  With 444 pages of material and also quite a lot of references to back up the chapters this book is exceptional. Bollet covers a multitude of areas in the world of the medical care featuring early war ill-preparation, being overwhelmed, medical science, surgery, amputations, wounds, hospitals, drugs, diseases, prison camps and important individuals of the time.  Every chapter offers added insight featuring biographies on people that may have had influence on the subject being written about that adds more intrigue to this book. This book is very comprehensive and fair to all parties involved often bringing to light the importance of doctors and nurses through out the entire war and it's aftermath.  Another interesting aspect of this book is that it discourages the myths and stereotypes of doctors during the Civil War that have survived to this day.  I recommend this book to anyone who studies medicine or the Civil War as much insight can be gained from this very thorough book.	2003-03-23

Author William Venner has assembled a useful book in relating to the history of the 19th Indiana. Venner has worked hard to back up his information offering many pages of footnotes that are handy in reenforcing his writing. This book is a fast read and chronologically follows the 19th from 1861 muster to final discharge as the unit is blended with the 20th Indiana. This book follows the hard fought history of a tough group of individuals that faced many conflicts such as Gainesville, Antietam, Gettysburg, The Wilderness and Petersburg. Venner does an excellent job covering the manpower involved in the regiment and how they survived with ever-dwindling numbers. Venner's writing is easy to read and not ever complex. This book is an excellent source for reading about the 19th Indiana as much is not written about this hard fighting group. 5 STARS!	2003-03-11

Tony Horwitz tries to nail down the attraction to the Southern cause many years after the battle. Horwitz travels with reenactors, visits popular Civil War battlefields and sites that covers much of the south. Interesting commentary from local townsfolk, political views and Horwitz's knack for bringing in some humor to his personal narrative really set this book apart. As the reader you learn as the author learns. Follow his journies into the deep back country places few know about or to popular tourist areas such as Gettysburg. Horwitz brings to life the Confederate cause by interviewing many different people from multiple backgrounds. Such a great journey by Horwitz has really brought to life that many still feel that the South has not surrendered nor lost the war entirely. This book is well written, entertaining and enjoyable to read!	2003-03-04

Priest likes to chronologically present the fighting from each army from their perspective as the action unfolds.  Priest may present the Confederate views and manuvers from the West Woods while the next paragraph may contain Union movements from the East Woods.  Priest takes the entire battle beginning to end and presents it in a unique way often not seen in books on the subject.  The details of the fighting and graphic accounts of the battle is excellent and at times very descriptive.  This book is not an ordinary account of the battle.  It simply captures the immediate action without covering the politics or reasons as to why Lee invaded Maryland or why McClellan refused to follow Lee after the conflict.  I was impressed with the quick, &quot;jump into the middle of the action&quot; style Priest presented in this rare format.  Priest used many maps to help explain the regimental movements throughout the book although I found them ill drawn and confusing at times.  Priest style of jumping from one event to another during a phase of the battle could be a bit twisting upon the reader and one should know that this book may not be for those who never read about the battle before.  I recommend this book for the more experienced person of knowledge concering this battle as a beginner or novice may be a bit overwhelmed or distracted by a different presentation.	2003-02-24

Being a fan of Forrest I was happy to see that Wills went to great pains to only write about true occurrences that he could back up with documentation.  Wills covers the myths and potentially wrong information developed by this great commander over the years and dispels them by trying to be fair and accurate in what took place.  Myths can become larger than life and Forrest is no stranger to such talk over the years.  Such potentially false information of Forrest isn't conveyed in this book.<br />Wills' coverage presents Forrest from early adulthood pre-war life all the way up until his death in 1877.  His battlefield coverage may not be as complete as other books on Forrest although he does cover many campaigns and exploits of this great Southern leader.  I felt Wills had skipped some exhaustive detail as found in other books about Forrest post-war career such as his involvement with the KKK, political world and business ventures.  Wills covers these but keeps the information quick, informative and focused.  Wills tries to realistically look at Forrest and present better facts which I appreciated.  Any fan of Forrest owes it to them to read this book to get new and fair insight into a rather large and sometimes mythical character that struggled through life in multiple hardships, conflict and destiny.	2003-02-13

Freemantle enters Texas and his journey starts there.  Soon he discovers how soldiers and civilians of the south live and handle the hardships of war.  Freemantle meets many popular Southern leaders such as Johnston, Davis, Lee, Longstreet during his travels.  He is very fortunate to give us interesting views of the people involved in hardships and conflicts in various cities of the south such as Jackson, Vicksburg, Richmond, Winchester and others.  His information certainly documents the timeline.  I was most interested in reading about his Gettysburg exploits as he has become more famous in modern times most likely due to the movie, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; in which he presented.  I was curious to read about his opinion and eye witness accounts which helped support explanations regarding the Battle of Gettysburg.  Freemantle doesn't involve himself in many details of battles or conflicts.  He likes to write about people and share his opinion of them.  After Gettysburg Freemantle travels north to board the ship China which will take him back home to England.  In doing this we are offered more interesting commentary as he writes about northern views and how northerners are coping with the draft, slavery and the war.  Overall this is a quick book to read although it is vital for any historian looking to understand people and places during the early summer of 1863.  I recommend it!	2003-01-25

Frank Williams has put together a very well written book which explores Lincoln's motivations, desires, thoughts and how he managed people.  Williams brings us interesting insight into the man where myth sometimes tells the wrong story.  Viewpoints on how Lincoln managed Union commanders, political opponents, slavery issues and people is really what this book covers. Williams treats his subject quite fairly showing both sides of the stories in which controvercy over Lincoln's actions have resided.  This book was a quick read although very enjoyable.  If you are a Civil War fan, you should consider this book as much is written.  How Lincoln handled popular generals such as McClellan, Meade, Hooker, Burnside and others was very interesting!	2003-01-17

The story of William Ray's is not entirely unique to Civil War history although his personal account brought forth by four years of great diary keeping brings the soldier daily grind to the forefront.  Ray's story is seldom full of action and captures the daily life of a young man of Wisconsin heritage fighting for the Union in the Army of the Potomac.  What flavors this monotonous story is that it truly brings the hard lifestyle of 19th Century soldiering to 21st Century readers.  This is an excellent book for historians looking to understand soldier thinking.  Ray writes about camp life, rumors, gossip, money, family, drill, picket duty, sickness, friends and the \\"hurry up and wait\\" philosophy of being an infantry soldier for the Union during the Civil War.  Ray's coverage of his fighting is brisk although many times his writing may have been tamed by the fact that he may have been writing with family in mind.  He may have not wanted his family to know the hard battle details in the event of his death where his diary could be discovered and sent home with his belongings.  Injured on several occasions such as the Battle of Gettysburg and The Wilderness, Ray enhances his story to give this book added information.  He writes about his wounds, healing, being sick and helping his fellow soldiers.  We are lucky to have such a large diary written which covers four years of the war.  From his enlisting, re-enlisting and final discharge Ray offers us a priceless look at a common infantry soldier.  His diary notes of the Siege of Petersburg and the mine explosion was very interesting. The ugly daily life of trench warfare certainly painted the struggle at hand.  Ray also gives us a definitive look at how the South was truly struggling as of 1864 and when 1865 rolls around he writes about Confederate deserters coming across the lines on a daily basis.  This information is seldom covered from a soldier's perspective and it is vital for those looking to understand the mentality of an everyday soldier who by 1864 was a proud Veteran of the boys of '61.  This book is also an excellent and valuable reference tool for those trying to learn about the Iron Brigade and more importantly the 7th Wisconsin.

This is a beautifully done book of great photographs.  As much as I liked the quality, I would have to tone down my excitement by the content. The pictures shown in this book are of general concern popular of telling the Civil War in a basic, simple format.  The photograph qualities are much better than I have saw in other books although I have seen a majority of them.  This book offers nothing new in the line of Gardner's work and is basically a 'greatest hits' of his work that followed the eastern theatre from the Union perpective.  Unfortunately Gardner never took pictures of dead Union soldiers or captured Union losses that much.  Gardner had a knack for enhancing pictures by using props such as moving a dead body to different locations or using weapons, canteens, etc. to be placed in the photograph.  By today's standards it is hard to imagine doctored photographs in a war-like setting but that was a part of Gardner's work.<br />His work is a very vital element to telling the hidden, horrid truths of the Civil War although this book offers very little in providing pictures not typically shown.  I would have loved to see different work instead of these classic photos commonly used in history books.  The book is of great quality and each photograph offers an explanation of the reasons the photo was taken or done.  I recommend the book to people who really do not have an understanding of Civil War photography or common knowledge of the war itself.  For the veteran enthusiast, it may seem very redundant and a perfect coffee table book.  I can't recommend it to the advanced historian as this book may bore you after the initial curiosity fades.	2002-12-28

Like other auto biographical books popular to the day, Sorrel has followed in his fellow soldiers' style of seldom covering their lives while detailing Confederate Army history. While following the Confederacy as an aide to Longstreet during the Civil War,  Sorrel rarely gives us an opportunity to look inside of him and judge for ourselves his emotions, thoughts or ideas during the years he served in as Longstreet's aide.  Instead, we are offered a vague history of the events unfolding that this man saw firsthand.  It was refreshing to read that he didn't include other events that he wasn't a part of like a John Gordon did in his reminiscences.  Sorrel is fair to all of the events and persons involved though his story isn't truly told.  His accounts of Gettysburg and other more memorable events during the war were disappointedly covered.  He would sometimes write of an incidence or event in his life though it was vague, quick and lacked useful information.  This book reminds me of Walter Taylor's who was General Lee's aide which was written in the same format with the same lack of information or personal style.  Sorrel does cover very little of his soldier life while spending many words focused on army movements and battles.  I was also disappointed to read very little about Longstreet as I would have hoped to have.  In conclusion, Sorrel writes very well, though unfortunately we are left with little content that reveals his true character or General Longstreet's for that matter leaving the reader wanting more.	2002-12-23

I'm not totally convinced that Coddington's work is the \\"Bible\\" of books on Gettysburg although it could be the closest on the subject. At least top \\"3\\" material!  Coddington's details of the early Union and Confederate politics, strategy and marches to Gettysburg was very informative.  Coddington's information builds the setting of this tremendous battle through both armies which allows for some very good reading.  Coddington covers all three days of the battle with a good balance of coverage to the events.  He also gets into the minds of popular key players such as Lee, Meade, Hancock, Sickles, Longstreet and others.  His battle coverage at times is not the ultimate in detail as I have read in Harry Pfanz's work although it is valuable. I found Trudeau's book on Gettysburg to use more of that in his coverage though Coddington's use of references is a book in itself which is a true asset and superior to others.<br />Written during the 60's Coddington was well ahead of his time in erasing popular battlefield myths that have grown over the years.  He was very fair to veterans of the battle who have written about their experiences years after the battle in which may have conflicting reports.  Coddington is very good at dispelling these accounts if needed which really gave this book a honest flavor without modern day politics getting into the way. It simply covers the campaign and leaves civilian life out of the battle that may leave some readers wanting more of it since the town of Gettysburg suffered from many hardships before, during and after the battle. Coddington sticks to the military drama with upmost focus. As the title states, it is a study of military command.<br />This book is very complete and is an immense study with 574 pages of reading while the references stack this monumental material well over 800 plus pages.

Similar in format to his books covering Day #1 and Day #2 issues, Gary Gallagher has assembled several writer/historians to offer or explain popular concerns of the Day #3 events. Authors offer their views on various subjects such as Confederate morale, Meade's decision to not pursue Lee, Pickett's Charge as a myth and more. Sadly, I did find Robert Krick's essay on Armistead and Garnett to be quite boring and not as useful for the Day #3 events as intended.  He liked to cover their military careers while very little was covered about their Gettysburg involvment.  I like Krick's work, but felt this essay could have worked in another book.<br />This book is intended for those who probably already have a good knowledge of the Day #3 events and may have had questions as to popular ideas and concepts of that day. True to the quality of his other books, Gary Gallagher has assembled a very good book with intention to cover these subjects which better explains them. This book is a must read for anyone studying Gettysburg and especially for those who are looking further into the third day fighting. This book won't cover the entire battle as others I would recommend for that. Instead, it focuses on the key issues. 5 STARS!!!!!	2002-11-26

Among the many books that cover the Battle of Gettysburg in its entirety it is impossible to assume that every detail or element can be covered to a large degree.  Such details can be found in books featuring a particular day of the battle or event.  Trudeau's book is a great look at the entire battle from Confederate and Union early marches into Pennsylvania all the way through to the aftermath of the conflict.  There is a great rhythmic flow to Trudeau's writing which makes for great reading.  Trudeau gets into every battle from each day while quoting from soldiers, officers or civilians that may have had something to say in regards to the events that unfolded.  Due to the immense amount of information that could be covered Trudeau does leave certain elements out of the book such as biography and some battle detail.  He was brief in regards to the Wheatfield battle and also the struggle for Little Round Top.  You won't see the details in this book as you would in a Harry Pfanz book though you will be guided by many maps which help back key positions and movements throughout the three day saga.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone learning about Gettysburg or who doesn't really have a large understanding of the battle.  For those with higher knowledge it may be a great book to use for thought as for example Trudeau doesn't shroud Chamberlain with many high honors while vaguely covering Lee's 2nd Day plan or Longstreet's countermarch.  As much as he may not cover some key issues Trudeau does bring to light other interesting points.  For example he does bring to light the political tensions in the Union army and how commanders seem to favor other certain commanders when such favoritism has dire consequences.  The issue of Buford's intelligence being passed over after Reynold's death because Doubleday and others preferred their own strategy brought about an interesting thought to this book.<br />Overall this is a very great book, very well written and definately worth reading for further insight! 5 STARS!!!ely worth reading for further insight! 5 STARS!!!	2002-11-19
US	52077199	R1TN1VQ4X1VVW	1572491280	329233205	Lincoln's Critics: The Copperheads of the North	Books	4	8	8	N	Y	Very informative!	Not too many books cover the subjects of Copperheadism during the Civil War or how such a group of people ever evolved.  Klement truly defines the persons or people who were Copperheads of the north that heavily favored democratic policy and beliefs during the 1850's to 1870's period of time.  It was interesting to read how postwar northerners defined Copperheads as anyone who sympathized with the south during the war when truly some Copperheads favored anti-war policies and states rights. This book is very detailed about popular northern democrats and political figures who were at odds against the Lincoln administration.  This book covers a lot. For example, details about economic strongholds on midwestern farmers helped define an anti-war sentiment as prices were being controlled by northeastern interest groups such as railroad companies and republican authority.  Many midwestern political opinion and feelings about the war are covered while the mid-atlantic states fight the Lincoln administration in favor of the south succeeding.  Klement brings a very detailed look at how Copperheadism evolved and fought to survive as an ideal way of life for some northerners who refused the war, Lincoln and a northern stronghold over the south.  I simply can't recommend a better book for covering such a heavily defined and detailed topic that Klement presents.	2002-11-03

It's sometimes tough finding memoirs or diary accounts that don't get involved in writing battle history on a larger scale that doesn't have anything to with the person writing it.  Rufus Dawes heavily battle tormented years in the hard fighting Iron Brigade only covers his involvment and the affairs of the Iron Brigade which I found refreshing to read.  Rufus Dawes has wrote down a lot in his diary and also wrote many letters home which are presented very well throughout this book.  Most of his diary writings mention the date and the events which occurred.  Dawes manages to define daily life activity in the camp and soldier actions.  What makes this book exciting is his detail for writing about his involvement at major battles such as Antietam, Gettysburg, Cold Harbor and more!  Rarely receiving a single scratch, Dawes manages to live to write about his military life as other officers around him eventually become discharged while a majority die.  He gets descriptive at times which captures the chaos and confusion of battle.  His writings also talk a lot about the Iron Brigade and it's a great reference for those trying to understand how hard fighting this group of soldiers were.  Unlike some recollections or memoirs, Dawes writes very well and makes this book easy to follow and read.  At times Dawes was very detailed and explains many army movements and his thoughts about approaching battle and surviving the aftermath.  I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the Civil War and especially for those looking to learn about the Iron Brigade.	2002-11-03

I wasn't sure just how much of the Wheatfield battle could be covered in great detail being that the book is under 135 pages of material while the rest is for statistics, reference,etc..  I enjoyed the fact that in this book Jay Jorgensen skipped the usual pre-battle and political nonsense that seem to litter modern day books on Civil War subjects.  Jorgensen quite quickly focused on the key players soon to be involved.  He covered McClaw's division from their early marches until they prepared for battle on the second day awaiting to boldly set upon battle history.<br />Jorgensen was very clear on positioning and skipped the popular controvercy of the 2nd Day battle which may make some of the more educated Gettysburg Battle students happy to know.  Jorgensen briefly mentions Lee's decisions, Sickle's movement or Longstreet's countermarch which I found refreshing.  Instead, Jorgensen places you the reader alongside Anderson, Barksdale, Kershaw and others as they press forward into action in the late afternoon of the 2nd.  As always I ask for maps and this book had plenty that I could use during the reading to understand the terrain and unit positions during the battle.  It was great to look at the maps and see how they progressed as the action unfolded throughout the book and units either advanced or retreated.<br />Jay Jorgensen has put together a fine book on this seldom written about subject of the Wheatfield that I feel was very important to the outcome at Gettysburg.  Though catastrophic to both sides, carrying this section of land was vital to Union success in regards to building a foundation for day 3.  Jorgensens complete work was very exciting to read as he captures a lot of the action in regards to soldier personal accounts being added, descriptive fighting and bloodshed.  This book is very thorough and covers the entire timeline of the Wheatfield battle.  I highly recommend this book! 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!	2002-10-26

Grant	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A great book on managing, leading and facing life's issues!	Identical to the book on leadership using Robert E. Lee, Kaltman has taken issues faced by Ulysses S. Grant and placed them in similar context.  Issues managers and people in general face are brought forth on how to deal with adversity, changes, demands, employees and other popular concepts are clearly written.  Kaltman has put together a great book in regards to managing work related and also non-work related issues that can be very beneficial to anyone.  The book is a rather quick read and covers many topics or situations Grant faced that could be represented towards leadership scenarios from his early beginnings to after the war.  This book is full of great insight and lessons to be learned from either failures or successes that Grant went through. Many people can benefit from reading this facinating book on leadership and take what they learned and use it in everyday life.  5 STARS!!!	2002-10-09

Can there be a book that is dull yet have some intrigue?  Booth's book on his Civil War life was rather disappointing to read.  It contained very little personal thought in regards to camp life and fighting in battles he was engaged in.  He sometimes skipped his narrative to stop the story and give a quick history lesson on what occurred.  Such was true with the Sharpsburg Campaign which I would have rather read his thoughts, reactions or what he was doing at the time.  Booth's 1st Maryland is later disbanded and refitted for Cavalry in which Booth is involved yet his personal story is second to a history tale of the Union and Confederate movements surrounding the Virginia and Maryland areas.  At times Booth intrigued me with his story of how they attempted to free Confederate hostages in a church held by tough Union forces in which Booth is shot in the leg and the quick skirmish ends in many bloody fatalities.  Stories such as these was what I was looking for. What I tired of reading was how Lee left Pennsylvania or how Pope was turned around at 2nd Manassas.<br />Booth is less than descriptive on his movements at times which seemed blury and though he can talk about a battle historically, he certainly doesn't set the reader up for his involvement or easily explain his movements.  I have found this true in other memoirs written by soldiers though this one can't be ranked like Sam Watkin's book or other well known Civil War biographies.  This book is a quick read of 170+pages though if the battle histories were erased it and the book just focussed on Booth, the book probably would have been half of that.  This book was rather dull and boring at times.	2002-10-03

This is one of those books that certainly captures the military career of Nathan Bedford Forrest without getting into much of his personal life history.  For trying to understand the man I would suggest Hursts' biography on Forrest.  This book was a rather in depth study of every situation Forrest was in during the Civil War.  It is strictly military and though thorough, it's lack of maps was troubling.  The maps used in the book rarely define the movements or are complicated to understand and poorly demonstrated.  Often they are used for a multiple of operations and are completely vague.  Had they been better implemented with information and used more often it would have truly completed this book.  I found this book by Henry to be less detailed in more popular matters of surrender and enemy deception compared to other books on Forrest.  It was easy to get lost at times in regards to reading about generals under Forrest and their movements throughout the western campaign.  Is this the best book on Forrest? Military speaking I rank it high, though as a well rounded biography it certainly isn't one as I don't think the author intended to bring that part of the man forward.  This book I found boring at times and I wondered how 465 of pages could be filled when detail about the man never surfaced except trivial military matters.	2002-09-29

Sylvia discusses various forms of dreams and how they effect our lives and also how we can deal with them.  Various forms from lurid, astral to prophetic Sylvia has examined and answered a multiple of questions from people over the years asking about dreams.  Her ability to look in to the information and decipher the meaning was Sylvia at her best.  I liked her subject dealing with deceased loved ones coming into communication during our sleep which is very fulfilling and informative.  Like all of Sylvia's work this book is very well done and enjoyable to read.  I always find out more about myself when I read her books and look forward to further publications from her!	2002-09-25

Similar to past works of Gallagher's, this book contains invididual chapters written by popular Civil War historians keying in on battle concerns, myths, strategies and political concepts during the campaign.  I really enjoyed reading William Blair's chapter on how Marylanders caught in the middle of political unrest viewed the campaign and Lee's invasion.  Brooks Simpson's chapter on how the Army of the Potomac was McClellan's bodyguard according to Lincoln really made me understand the political frustrations the Lincoln party had in regards to McClellan's slow moving and cautious approach to battle.  Keith Bohannon's view on Confederate logistical problems was very informative and really brought forth information as to Lee's reasons for invading the north and also his retreat.<br />These chapters are just some of the great amount of information brought together in a very fine book.  I would recommend this book to someone who has already read a book on the battle itself before reading this one.  This book contains some fighting information but isn't one for coverage on the entire battle.  It is one for understanding political unrest, commander motivations, strategies and little unknown and sometimes unclear myths that surround the entire campaign in September 1862.  5 STARS!!!	2002-09-24

This newfound bundle of patriotic spirit is quickly humbled by the baptism of fire.  Warfield is involved in many skirmishes and battles such as 1st Manassas, Seven Pines, 2nd Manassas, Sharpsburg and more.  His descriptions or movements are a bit hard to follow though his story of daily camp life is excellent.  The details of fighting and others in battle is a bit `matter of fact' at times though he does share his opinions on subjects as comrades dying or being injured.  His story is rather quick as there are 180 pages of material that he has put together.  This book is a valuable asset for understanding soldier life and how one perceived war.	2002-09-18

The system scan and virus protection is great, but my computer didn't handle it very well and would get slowed down by the software trying to search for viruses in every movement.

Informative! A great reference tool!	This little, almost handsize book is a great reference tool for anyone that is a reeanctor or learning about soldier life and the rules of it.  Completed in 1864, this book covers all camp duties, responsibilities, allowances, etc.. It simply covers privates, cavalry and officer roles and promotion procedures.  I can't think of a better reference tool for a job description-like guide.<br />Since this book was written in the Civil War era, it is interesting to read things like, &quot;In cases of 'excessive fatigue' or 'severe exposure', soldiers may receive one issue of whiskey of one gill per ration.<br />It simply doesn't get better for direct information about the Union army rules by the government.

Sears has put together an outstanding book which should be easily classified as a Civil War classic.  Sears covers political tension in Washington and the uproar over continuous Union defeats and leadership.  Written clearly and concise, this book builds the situation or develops the structure for giving basis to Lee's decision to move the Army of Northern Virginia into Maryland.  More interesting was McClellan's organizing troops for further campaigns while dealing with tough bureaucrats in Washington.  His cautious approach to battle was a large concern for many and it helped explain his decisions later in the story in regards to not pursuing Lee's army on the 18th of September the day after the bloody Battle of Antietam.  Besides covering McClellan's operations, the book covered the Confederate raid and seige of Harper's Ferry.  Sears covered all Union and Confederate advances to Sharpsburg/Antietam allowing for better understanding of which corp went where, who followed who, which city and time,etc..  The battle coverage was outstanding and well versed, though I preferred more maps (as I always do).  Sears covers the battle from start to finish and also covers Lee's retreat and the political issues surrounding this great battle afterwords.  This book is a must have for any student of the Civil War.  It should be in everyones' library as it covers the bloodiest day of battle ever in the entire Civil War.	2002-09-14

Porter Alexander put off writing a book about his life in the US Military and also the Confederate Army for many years until he finally listened to his families pleas to put together a book. After 40 years Alexander started to re-trace his steps back in time to discuss his life and also many others. Alexander is careful and considerate to all of those he came into contact with and also very descriptive and helps historians of modern times to understand questionable events such as those like the battles of Gettysburg, Seven Days, Chancellorsville, Chattanooga and the siege of Petersburg.<br />As much as I liked reading about Alexander's situations, I discovered that he sometimes gets off the subject matter at hand to discuss a certain individual or event that had little to do about what he was writing about. He will sometimes change the flavor of the chapter with this and then say, &quot;I will write more when I come to that later..&quot; Such a strange format could have been eliminated by the editor to correspond to the correct chapter of events in the book. His 'conversationalist' style of writing is almost a dictation of recorded words from the man himself without editing which can zig-zag his chapters with a multitude of information.<br />As his writing style isn't the best, it is overshadowed by quite a lot of useful information and his thoughts are shared which brings about much needed character to his battlefield reporting. Sometimes a bit winded, Alexander tends to write about events or individuals in which he wasn't apart of. He would get into issues such as the Atlanta campaign in which he didn't take part of but wanted to share his opinion. At times I found his opinion important for events he was involved in which were especially crucial while reading about Gettysburg. Alexander does a find job discussing the events surrounding the Petersburg area that made it obvious the supply shortened Confederacy had little chance of survival. He points out very interesting ideas as he thought that surrender should have happened much earlier in 1863 or 1864 than in 1865 when everything was decimated.<br />Alexander's book may be a very long book as it has 552 pages of content from him. It is a must read for anyone trying to understand events from a personal account standpoint. This book almost wasn't published and lingered for years before it was found and put together. Gary Gallagher has assembled quite a book here and deserves many honors for it!

It was interesting to read about fighting in the 5th Texas, Company F and the thoughts that ran through Fletcher's mind at Gettysburg. The uncertainty, the horrors and the patriotism all wrapped into one was very rewarding to read about. His escape from Union hands was inspiring as he did what he could do to get back to Texas. This book is a must have for those seeking further knowledge and input from a soldier account. 5 STARS!!	2002-09-09

Similar to the book, &quot;Life of Johnny Reb&quot;, Bell Irvin Wiley has put together the life of being a soldier in the Union army.  From muster to homecoming this books covers many subjects.  Subjects such as northern soldier views on visiting the South for the first time, civilians, slavery, camp life and more.  There was a chapter which covered Union perspective about going into battle and fighting which I found especially interesting.  Chapter content is backed by letters from actual soldiers that add important weight to the quality of information in this book.  I simply hated to put the book down when I read it as it had some funny situations of soldier life mixed with the hard drama of warfare.  This book is a must have for those seeking to understand the Union soldier from many perspectives.  It doesn't get into boring battle detail or mention officers at length which I found refreshing for a change. It simply covers just about every aspect of being a Union soldier during the Civil War and should be in everyones' Civil War library! 5 STARS!!	2002-09-06

Barbara Lane has taken several people that are for the most part reenactors or people absolutely hooked on the Civil War era and basically gave them a past life reading through hypnosis.  Barbara Lane writes about each person she has regressed and also writes about their history, how they became interested in the Civil War and what they gained from being regressed or views about themselves.  Many times they were shocked, or non-believers about the concept of being hypnotically regressed to go back to a past life and reveal situations of a life time that involved the Civil War era.  How their lives in another life time were discussed to show how their lives are effected this time around.  It was all very interesting.  Reenactors and people interested in reincarnation would love this book as it offers further insight in to strange, but yet unusually accurate ideas about past lives.  Who knows, if you love the Civil War, perhaps you were alive back then?  Read this book to discover your similarities!	2002-09-04

I couldn't put it down!	Like many of Sylvia's books, this one just was as great!  Sylvia discusses past lives and how personalities of people are carried over from lifetime to lifetime.  Events such as how someone may have died may effect that person in another lifetime and it was interesting how Sylvia hypnotically regressed people through a past lifetime to discover things that person didn't know.  It was a great book to understand phobias.  Such as the fear of drowning or water.  Perhaps Sylvia's client had drown in a past life and this time around it is pinpointed and resolved so that person can continue life more normally.  Sylvia had put together a great collection of stories from her clients over the years to put together a book on how to become mentally stronger and deal with our fears, hostilities or negative influences to have a positive result.  I couldn't put this book down and read it rather quickly as with other Sylvia Brown books, you won't be disappointed.	2002-09-04

Porter Alexander put off writing a book about his life in the US Military and also the Confederate Army for many years until he finally listened to his families pleas to put together a book.  After 40 years Alexander started to re-trace his steps back in time to discuss his life and also many others.  Alexander is careful and considerate to all of those he came into contact with and also very descriptive and helps historians of modern times to understand questionable events such as those like the battles of Gettysburg, Seven Days, Chancellorsville, Chattanooga and the siege of Petersburg.<br />As much as I liked reading about Alexander's situations, I discovered that he sometimes gets off the subject matter at hand to discuss a certain individual or event that had little to do about what he was writing about.  He will sometimes change the flavor of the chapter with this and then say, &quot;I will write more when I come to that later..&quot; Such a strange format could have been eliminated by the editor to correspond to the correct chapter of events in the book.  His 'conversationalist' style of writing is almost a dictation of recorded words from the man himself without editing which can zig-zag his chapters with a multitude of information.<br />As his writing style isn't the best, it is overshadowed by quite a lot of useful information and his thoughts are shared which brings about much needed character to his battlefield reporting.  Sometimes a bit winded, Alexander tends to write about events or individuals in which he wasn't apart of.  He would get into issues such as the Atlanta campaign in which he didn't take part of but wanted to share his opinion.  At times I found his opinion important for events he was involved in which were especially crucial while reading about Gettysburg.  Alexander does a find job discussing the events surrounding the Petersburg area that made it obvious the supply shortened Confederacy had little chance of survival.  He points out very interesting ideas as he thought that surrender should have happened much earlier in 1863 or 1864 than in 1865 when everything was decimated.<br />Alexander's book may be a very long book as it has 552 pages of content from him.  It is a must read for anyone trying to understand events from a personal account standpoint.  This book almost wasn't published and lingered for years before it was found and put together.  Gary Gallagher has assembled quite a book here and deserves many honors for it!  This book will probably always rank with the few as being the best ever and should be in anyone's Civil War library!very interesting ideas as he thought that surrender should have happened much earlier in 1863 or 1864 than in 1865 when everything was decimated.  <br />Alexander's book may be a very long book as it has 552 pages of content from him.

Gangrene and Glory is a great book covering just about every aspect of medical related issues in the Civil War. It covers key players in the development of medical affairs while bringing forth quite a bit of information to many subject matters. For example, some of the subject matters consist of Confederate/Union healthcare,development,training,medicine,supply,diseases and surgical procedures on and off of the battlefield. Interesting stories are added to certain areas which enhance the book, plus there is mathematical data to back up the chapters. This book is a must read for those interested in medicine and medical operations during the Civil War. It is a somewhat fast read, though gets to the point and has many pictures and is thoughtfully easy to read.	2002-08-30

Guerrilla warfare is seldom spoken in Civil War circles or written about.  Probably one of the more popular characters in this topic from that period is Bill Anderson.  Authors Albert Castel and Thomas Goodrich have assembled quite a bit of useful information in regards to Anderson's ambitions, motivations, movements and operations throughout Kansas and Missouri.  This dangerous, callous and revengeful individual is brought forth to show how rough and chaotic war can be, especially for a divided state such as Missouri.  Anderson leads his small band of raiders throughout these states living like desperate pirates to plunder towns and more importantly hunt down enemies to the extreme.<br />Anderson's life is never short of violence as he is the ultimate and sadistic leader of a dangerous group of bandits that have borderline allegiances to the Confederate cause.  Portraying to be Union Cavalry, Anderson and his band of murderers steal, burn, kill and ravage towns of Union sympathizers.  Union Militia throughout the state of Missouri is quickly and badly organized to hunt down Anderson and his company that seems to constantly grow larger in membership.  Anderson raids towns such as Fayette and Centralia leaving deadly results by killing many former Union soldiers, burning depots and various other buildings while looting stores.  Anderson and his gang are always drinking and whiskey seems to elevate their need for murder and money that never ends.<br />Is he ever stopped?<br />Like many, I couldn't resist this book and wished for more though there is quite a bit of useful information for a short book of roughly 144 pages.  It was descriptively well-written, concise, maps and pictures were included which gave the book a great rhythmic flow as far as content. 5 STARS!!	2002-08-20

Johnny Green was one of the very few to survive nearly 3 years of hard fighting, living and dealing with the hardships of war.  His regiment lost nearly all of its strength in two years while the remaining joined up with the Cavalry in late 1864 for the remainder of the war.  Johnny Green brings firsthand accounts to the battles of Shiloh, Vicksburg, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Atlanta and various skirmishes inside the Tennessee,Georgia and South Carolina regions.  His writing is not the best nor is spelling and pronounciation superb though he manages to tell his story well.  Many he times writes about the confusion, lack of food, foraging, sharpshooting and massive artillery bombardments that would make it unstandable as to why nearly nobody lived.  He brings you to camp and makes you feel as if you are there with the soldiers on a daily basis.  He expresses his thoughts about his fallen comrades and his dovotion to the Southern cause when he is captured by Union troops near Atlanta.  This  interesting, tragic, humorous and deadly tale is brought together in 207 pages and covers a lot the Orphan Brigade's life. Great photographs, renderings and maps are included to match those mentioned in the book like Colonels, Generals,etc. This book is a great source of information for those interested in reading about Kentuckians involved in western campaigns and also about a decimated brigade in the Civil War.	2002-08-16

Shaara follows in his father's footsteps to write about popular northeastern Civil War generals or key players in the northern campaigns.  As a prelude to Gettysburg (movie)/Killer Angels (book), Shaara's novel covers the beginnings of Generals like Jackson, Lee and Hancock.  He explains where they were, what they did and how they came into the fold of war.  Shaara paints a picture easy to follow and develops his characters well with descriptive writing.  This method explains these men of history to make the reader understand their personalities and lifestyle.  Shaara follows history quite well though treats this era with fiction in which real-life human individuals are named and placed in historical context.  Shaara likes to portray people like General Lee and Jackson as almost \\"God-like\\" entities in his writing.  That is where a mythological, larger-than-life feeling is born and these people tend to be blessed with Zeus-like traits.  This makes for great fiction though I think it becomes overdone since real names and places are being used.  Shaara's writing seems flowery and poetic at times when it comes to these individuals making them seem absolute, perfect and without flaw or error.  Such traits are God-like and it rings true to the title of the book.<br />As the war grows these God-like characters are involved in the major campaigns such as Fredericksburg, Antietam and Chancellorsville.  Shaara's balance of covering the Fredericksburg battle was excellent.  The events surrounding key players like Lee,Longstreet,Jackson,Hancock,Burnside and Couch bring the great winter saga to the front with very descriptive and intelligent presentation.  The battle of Chancellorsville completes the final fourth of this fine book which covers Jackson's flanking movement on Hooker's army, the death of Jackson and Hooker's retreat from the city.  This book will soon be out as a movie in early 2003.	2002-08-15

For the beginner, this is an excellent book though it contains as much information as a coffee table book would.  Sadly it doesn't have the pictures or quality of a coffee table book and is a paperback.  There are some maps to help explain the battle movements but this book about the battle of Antietam is shorter than the biographies written inside about the generals involved.  The biographies that are featured are presented well and are chronologically presented as the history of the battle unfolds.  This is a great feature though shadows the main content of the book.  There were times I wanted to turn the page and continue reading the battle information but had to stop to read a separate biography about a key general in the battle.  This book is a very quick read and can probably be read in over an hour as there are roughly 111 pages of material while the rest is for Union and Confederate Order of Battle.  The Order of Battle I found useless for this book as it contains major individuals not at all mentioned in the book.  I could see and Order of Battle for large, indepth book but this one didn't come close to that.<br />As previously suggested, this book is great for the beginner learning to understand the major conflicts at Antietam but for the advanced student I wouldn't recommend it as it just doesn't contain much detail.  For example, the Rohrbach Bridge/Burnside Bridge battle is covered in 5 pages (1 page contains a map, another a biography).	2002-08-06

Gary Gallagher has brought together the 2nd Day at Gettysburg in a format similar to his 1st Day book in regards to Union and Confederate leadership.  This 2nd Day book offers insight to popular questions and accusations made towards officers involved in various battles during the second day of events.  As with other publications by Gallagher, Gallagher teams up with other noted historians in a series of chapters that offer their viewpoints to popular battles during the 2nd Day.  Gary Gallagher takes on the tough task of questions that arise to Lees decisions to attack in the early morning of July 2nd, 1863 while William Glenn Robertson tries to answer questions in regards to Daniel Sickles 3rd Corps movements.<br />Robertson defines Sickles with great biography to paint a picture of a man whose military leadership is often backed by political tension and propaganda.  Robertson does a fine job in looking at Sickles reasons for moving the 3rd Corps and also Meades reaction to such positioning.  As the book continues Robert Krick looks at General James Longstreet and tries to answer questions as to why this general was slow to react to Lees orders on the 2nd how others around the man were upset with his sluggish approach to handling the 2nd day affairs.  Krick points out key elements to Longstreets decision making as it was typical of the commander to be defensive and stubborn throughout the Civil War.  It was interesting to read Kricks views on Longstreets career and how Longstreet handled southern verbal attacks made against him for years after the war.<br />Wilson Greene brought on his chapter in regards to Howard Slocums defense of Culps Hill.  Greene initially captured the flavor of Slocum though soon ran into a lengthy discussion of Culps Hill deployment and battle which did not seem to compliment this chapters basis of discussion.  I felt it painted a good picture of the events though didnt associate with enough impact to Slocum.  Slocum I felt became a less-than central figure in the discussion which seemed to lessen the importance of titling the chapter Henry J. Slocum and the Twelfth Corps on July 1-2, 1863. I was disappointed with this chapter.<br />Scott Hartwig brought on a very intriguing and worthwhile chapter in regards to the Wheatfield which centered on General Caldwell and his command.  This was a very refreshing chapter after being bored with Greens Slocum chapter.  Hartwig wanted to show that Sickles blunder had brought about chaos and confusion for other commanders such as Caldwell.  Over years Caldwell has taken much blame for his rigid task at hand at the Wheatfield conflict in the 2nd.  Hartwig defines the movments and executions carefully with maps and thorough research making this chapter probably the best written of all.  It reads well and also shows that Caldwell had a huge undertaking thrust upon him that afternoon on the 2nd and respectively handled a burdensome task.<br />This book is a great read for those looking to deepen their Gettysburg research.  For the novice I would not recommend this book as it does not bring forth the entire 2nd Day battle, it only answers questions popular to 2nd Day events.  For the student looking for further insight, I highly recommend this book.  Its a must read!!t to Slocum.

Move over Stewart and other authors who have written about Pickett's Charge, Earl Hess is the new sheriff in town!  Hess leaves the polictics and modern day views of the battle far away and gets down to just the battle itself.  Hess is careful to explain Confederate positions on the morning of July 3rd with great detail. Gibbon and the First Corps, Hay's Division and other Federal Unit positions are closely written about as to time and place.  The bombardment is covered from Confedarate and Union perspective which I found to be very helpful in questions that I had in understanding time and effect.  Hess is careful in explaining not only Pickett's Division's crossing but also covers Pettigrew's assault completely.  What is interesting is that each segment or piece of time of the battle is presented from both Union and Confederate view points. I liked reading about how Gibbon's Division prepared and fought as well as I liked reading about Pickett's men reaching the stone wall.  Cadmus Wilcox's futile attempts to support Pickett along with evening accounts from both sides complete this lengthy and thorough book. Hess' exhaustive detail and care make this book an important asset to one understanding Pickett's Charge.  Without a doubt it my new favorite on the subject.	2002-08-02

Tucker takes the entire battle beginning to end and places it together for the novice reader.  Where does the \\"first-timer\\" look for a well rounded book on the battle?  He or she may find it here.  Tucker does an excellent job getting the basis for the battle complete while covering issues such as Lee's Campaign, Heth's attack, Longstreet's flank march, Little Round Top, Culp's Hill, the Pickett/Pettigrew charge and of course Lee's retreat from Pennsylvania.  Don't let the word novice scare you or the fact that it was written in the late fifties sway your decision.  Tucker includes many details and backs them up with roughly 400 pages of information valuable to anyone looking to gain further insight on Gettysburg.  Does Tucker grab everything common in books covering certain days or events in Gettysburg? No.  Though for someone trying to understand and get the general format of the battle, this is the book to read.	2002-07-30

Al Kaltman has assembled an interesting and refreshing book about issues General Lee faced during his entire life.  More of the documented letters featuring opinions and Lee offered others during his military adventures through Mexico and the Civil War are intriguing.  Kaltman takes Lee's approach to subjects on managing people or conflicts and offers advice on how to handle similar circumstances in business and personal life situations.  This book is rather a quick read as topics such as preparing one's self, taking command, continuous improvement and the winning image are just a few of many that are featured.<br />This book is one you can jump from chapter to chapter on and not read from start to finish if you wanted as it deals with leadership approaches for various subjects.  This book I recommend to anyone involved in business be it a salesperson or manager looking to better themselves with great thought.  Also it can be a book one could keep with them at work as a helpful guide to reflect back on for insight on how to deal with situations that arise.  Lee's style of handling issues is usually the correct and friendly non-confrontational approach which many could benefit from reading.  On another side of this great book, Lee's failures or mistakes are also covered and Lee offers his thoughts on how he should have handled things differently.	2002-07-24

Stewart covers the action based from information available during the 1950's which certainly explains the battle quite well.  This book was probably the first and best on the subject of Pickett's Charge and has become a timeless classic.  For students of the battle I highly recommend it as Stewart's writing doesn't reflect modern thought or opinion as to the Longstreet/Lee confrontation or delay in ordering the charge.  Stewart is careful to explain positioning and uses maps to place the reader on the vast field.  He also adds biography to certain individuals which adds a bonus to this great book!  This book is the &quot;main-stay&quot; for anyone who is interested in the charge at Gettysburg.	2002-07-24

Hassler manages to bring the reader to the front without much delay and the action gets right to the point. Common among other 1st Day books in regards to Gettysburg are sometimes boring biographies of people involved.  This book simply skips the biography and states the incident quite quickly.  From AP Hill's movements, Buford's defense, the 1st and 11th Corps retreat and the mad dash through town to Cemetary Hill this book quickly defines what happened.  It was refreshing reading the regiment movements and actions along with the officers' guidance in these chapters.  This book is not of the huge detail that is common in Harry Pfanz's book on the 1st Day, though it is a rather quick study of the general events that played out on July 1st 1863.<br />One thing that I wished were more prevalent were the use of maps. Hassler's regiment movements were sometimes a bit hard too follow.  This book is one you would want to take to the battlefield and read as you could use the markers and monuments to get a better understanding. Some maps are used though I found them not as helpful as in other books on the subject.<br />Overall I think this book deserves the 5 stars as it captures the important aspects of Day #1 without lengthy trivial details.  It reads well and focusses on just one thing- Day #1!	2002-07-21

Being a fan of the Civil War and involved with managing a business, I found this book quite inciting and useful.  Lee's methods for dealing with people throughout his life offered thoughtful approach to situations in modern times that anyone can find beneficial.  This book covers Lee's early stages in life and strikes with a wealth of information regarding his involvement in the Civil War. Lee after the war and his death is presented with leadership examples that offer a great view of the man and his ability to handle many situations.  In this coverage, author H.W. Crocker III captures important events in Lee's history and explains Lee's approach to being leader in them.  What makes an interesting addition to this book is that Lee's triumphs are also covered as well as his failures.  How Lee handles such events are dramatically conveyed and offer great value to the reader.  I would highly recommend this book for everyone, as people who are not managers or involved in business can benefit. This is a great book for anyone looking to improve their life while offering peaceful and thoughtful resolve to conflicting situtations.	2002-07-15

Not many books seem to cover a scout's exploits during the Civil War in the form of a personal memoir.  Berry Benson's account seems to be a diary mixed with recollection and struggle.  Benson's writing is vague at times and a bit hard to follow.  He seems to jump from event or time frame without much flow or detail. His involvement at Sharpsburg, Chancelorsville and Petersburg is disappointing when it comes to detail and the action.  Had an author placed this book together to build the time frame up and then switch to Benson's accounts would have made this book easier to follow or had Benson been more descriptive in his story it would have completed this book.<br />What made this book interesting was his escapes from two Union prisons and his personal struggle to survive and get back to Virginia.  His descriptions of his escapes and his run for freedom was very interesting and made this book come to life.<br />The title itself which mentions sharpshooter fails to live up to it's name as very little is written about his involvement as one and again the detail is missing.  Had the title mentioned escaping twice from Union hands, it would have been properly titled.  Though the lack of details and vague approach stumbles the reader an opposite read is featured in regards to his survival and escaping Union control.  Without his prison stories which fortunately takes up a large portion of this book, it would have been confusing and frustrating.  Because of those stories I felt this book deserves a 4 star rating.	2002-07-11

Instead of overstated positioning and endless biography, Civil War Historian Gary Gallagher and other noted historians have come together to offer their views on various leadership tactics involved during the first day of battle.  Alan Nolan covers Confederate strategy and Lee's leadership role in the Pennsylvania campaign how certain maneuvers lead to dire consequences.  Gary Gallagher offers his thoughts in the role of A.P. Hill and Richard Ewell and questions their leadership during the fighting.  Could they have been more involved?  Did they listen to Lee's orders?  Was Ewell fairly treated in his reasons for not advancing further on the late afternoon of the 1st?  Gallagher opens and answers these questions while prompting new insight.<br />Wilson Green explores Union tactics and leadership involving Howard and the 11th Corp operations.  Did Howard coordinate and properly lead this Corp at Gettysburg?  Could disaster been avoided? Robert Krick brings to life the failure of Heth's approach in bringing in his weakest brigade, Iverson and Oneal's poor executions leading to disastrous failures along Oak Ridge.<br />Finally, this book isn't for those just looking to understand the 1st Day, it is for those who have a higher knowledge of the the battle and are looking for answers in regards the above mentioned.  Does it get in to all of the issues of the 1st Day?  No. It does exactly what the cover says, it explores leadership on popular issues.	2002-07-08

Though facing serious defeats in 1863, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia is ready to tackle the newly appointed former western campaign leader U.S. Grant and his Army of the Potomac.  Author and historian Gary Gallagher builds the awareness of such great expectations from both sides which sets the stage for a great conflict.  His writing captures the flavor of northern morale and the polictical situation around Washington.  The frustration with former Union commanders and a long and brutal war have dampened spirits in the north and this book is great at building the reasons for why and how the spring campaign of 1864 began. This book is written by a multiple of great Civil War authors that enhance this great battle.<br />Foiled Union Cavalry movements of Sheridan start the season off as Ewell and AP Hill come to meet and fight the approaching Grant.  Writer Peter Carmichael and Gordon Rhea bring these actions to the front with great detail.  Movements and maps are easy to follow.<br />The famous, &quot;Lee to the rear!&quot; episode of the Wilderness is brought forth by Robert Krick which certainly explains the situation of Lee wanting to lead his men.  Many personal soldier accounts are brought into the fold to dispell doubts or conflicting stories about this great event in Civil War history.  Carol Reardon and Robert Krick bring together the struggle famous Vermont Brigade battle and Longstreet's flank attack on May the 6th.  Longstreet's fall from friendly fire  and the confusion faced by Mahone's men is covered well.  To understand the Wilderness campaign this is an essential 'must have' for anyone trying to understand the thoughts, plans, tactics and outcomes of the battle.	2002-07-06

It can be very useful for the student of the battle who is trying to understand positioning and the terrain. Though these maps are well done, they are of the paper variety you typically find at gas stations. I was a bit disappointed in the lack some details and that these maps were made to be like that of the fold-out kind.

Rollins is very fair in his insight while introducing an individual's story. From the early stages of artillery placement, Union and Confederate positioning on Day #3, the cannonade, assault and repulse, this book covers it all. Letters and sections from biographies are presented from not just Generals and Colonels but all the way down to individual private soldier accounts. This book is a great tool for those trying to understand Pickett's charge and how soldiers involved told of their struggles. It is interesting to read their accounts written days or even years after the battle. On several accounts it is easier to get clarity in regards to a certain regiment or company movement. Though many stories are sometimes repititous as to the event, the commentary in regards to the action is unique! This book would compliment anyone interested in understanding the charge in a much more deeper view. For a beginner it may be hard to follow though for one who understands the charge or has had more time reading about it, I would recommend it highly!	2002-06-27

I like to refer to this book as a colorful, well done &quot;coffee table&quot; book as it features many drawings, photos and skips the details you would find in other books about the battle. This book is probably not for those looking for details  or heavy explanations about a specific conflict in the battle. For one that is looking to get a basic understanding of the battle and aftermath quickly it is perfect.  For those new to understanding Gettysburg this is an excellent book.  Having read many books about the battle I found this book interesting in regards to the personal accounts that are found on just about every page.

The entire town was littered with sharpshooters, Confederate soldiers, the wounded and prisoners. The Gettysburg people were basically caught up in this fray and this book demonstrates the horrors and hardships that these people witnessed.  Personal accounts are placed together in almost a novel-like format which places the reader quite easily within the action itself.  Stories such as housing the wounded, losing a home, sharing food with the soldiers caught up in battle and witnessing the bloodshed are among the many stories within this great book.  It is a must read for those looking to understand Gettysburg completely.	2002-06-13
US	52077199	RU8WDY8QSC3F	0553298321	780981222	Gettysburg	Books	5	14	14	N	N	A view from both sides!	This book starts off with a great and fair introduction to the two stories that are to be told by William Oates of the Confederacy and Frank Haskell of the Union.  Written by Glenn LaFantasie the lengthy introduction writes about both Civil War authors Oates and Haskell.  He is careful in explaining that each man's history, background and present situation which may have had an effect on their writing.  After the introduction William Oates of the 15th Alabama structures his story first by giving an historical view of the army movments north and south as a prelude to the battle of Gettysburg.  His writing of such a history could probably have been eliminated while his story of marching to Gettysburg and his role in the battle should have taken precedent.  Oates offers his controversial view of the battle which is interesting in many ways.  Not only does he tell his story but he tells it painted his way.  Being a reader of many Gettysburg related books, it is easy to find fault with some of Oates' story.  Though this is what makes this book interesting.  We need to know what Oates considered and thought was how things went instead of guessing.  We need something to stand on and his story though it may not be accurate is very descriptive and essential for understanding the battle.<br />While Oates offered his view of the 15th Alabama's fight to take Little Round Top, a great story is to follow written by Frank Haskell.  Unfortunately, Haskell tends to waste the immediate structure of the battle like Oates had earlier.  He tells the readers where such a corps was placed, who was advancing, etc.  This boring non-relating story he tells doesn't tell about him or his action in the battle.  After this quick and non essential tale of the battle of Gettysburg, Haskell finally gets to his involvement in the fight.  This is where Haskell gets interesting.  He is very fair on his descriptions and how he associates with other Generals during the conflict.  His tale of Pickett's Charge and the carnage is excellent.  I really liked Haskell's discipline in not reacting to telling about a battle on the field that he didn't take part in or had not witnessed.  His graphic tale of Pickett's charge and the movements covered certainly placed myself right along with him on the field.  He builds up Day #3 of Gettysburg very well and comes to a complete end to his story without dragging the reader.<br />For the novice reader of the battle of Gettysburg, I wouldn't recommend this book as it is not generalized enough to understand without reading more of the basic battles of the three day saga.  For the advanced reader looking for more historical insight written by two soldiers that were actually there, this is an excellent book and I recommend it completely.Charge and the carnage is excellent.

Nesbitt's approach to telling the diaries of two soldiers written on similar dates was a great idea though I found that the Union story of Private Horner lacked the details compared to his opposition Confederate Private Ware.  Ware's details seem to blur Horner's quick and rather limited writing.  Both soldiers certainly write about the marching and battle while Nesbitt tries to balance army movements with historical backing and concepts.  I found the maps helpful but often hard to follow because they were photos of very detailed maps that made things hard to read in black and white.  Had they been less of detail or re-drawn for the book as other history books it would have been much easier to comprehend.  As much as I am a fan of Nesbitt's work I found myself reading this book and wanting more detail as the book is a very quick read. I would have liked to give this book 3.5 Stars though Amazon's rating system doesn't allow for halves.	2002-05-23

After the largest battle to take place in the Civil War the city of Gettysburg was basically turned upside down.  The wounded and the dead lied about 25 square miles of the battlefield left behind by both Confederate and Union armies.  Few surgeons were on hand and the lack of medical supplies, food and proper shelter was an immense problem.  Just as medical help slowly arrived, family members looking for lost loved ones, battlefield scavengers, volunteer medics, nurses and the curious fled to the battle ravaged town.  Author Gerard Patterson covers many of these subjects and how the town struggled to come together and rebuild from it's shattered state.  Civilian commentary, biographies of soldiers and medical leaders are brought forward to enhance the gripping information.  If you are looking for a great book on Gettysburg to compliment the battle this is an excellent choice. A key to remember is that this book focuses quite a bit towards the medical aspects of how the town handled the awesome task at hand of taking care of the wounded and the dead.  In order to understand Gettysburg one must compliment this book because there was so much more to the battle of Gettysburg than just the battle.	2002-05-20

Laine and Penny definately tell the full story of Law's Alabamians concentrated in Gettysburg.  Their origination, marches from Virginia through Maryland and into Pennsylvania is covered well.  As the story develops and the brigade reaches Gettysburg plenty of first hand accounts backed by short biographies add to the excellent coverage.  These accounts and biographies are also carried throughout as individuals popular to certain action in the timeline come into the fold.  Descriptive details of each regimental movement such as 44th and 48th Alabama being sent towards Devils Den and the struggle for Little Round Top carried by the 15th Alabama is quite interesting.  The authors are careful in explanation as maps are used to back conflicting movements, orders and the general chaos throughout Plum Run and around the Round Tops.  Union positions and personal accounts are also introduced during the various battles to benefit the reader as well.  Interesting closure to the battle is offered as Law's Brigade battles Kilpatrick's Cavalry on Day #3 and on as the brigade retreats from Gettysburg.  Not only was I surprised to read about retreat back to Virginia but I was also pleased to read about Law's skirmishes in protecting the Confederate retreat from Union Cavalry pursuits.  An added bonus for the reader comes towards the end when certain individuals brought forth through the story have their outcomes mentioned.  Some were captured, some died, some disappeared never to be found.  This book is an excellent source for anyone interested in learning about Law's Alabama Brigade and their lives during May,June and July 1863.	2002-05-14

Like his other outstanding books Pfanz continues the superior details backed by biographies and personal accounts.  Pfanz briefly explains the 1st Day battle and how it basically shaped Union and Confederate positions around Cemetary and Culp's Hill. After bringing the reader into position Pfanz brings you to the frontlines as General Ewell and General Howard collide. Ewell and the Confederates seize the town and sharpshooters abound on roof tops while artillery battles take place between Cemetary Hill and Benner's Hill. Pfanz then captures General Johnson's attack and the Confederate repulse as the Confederates struggle to take Culp's and Cemetary Hill and the final attacks fail and continue to cause extreme bloodshed.  Maps are also included to assist the reader with positions and movements which completes this fine book.  As with all of Pfanz's work, be prepared for a huge amount of detail followed by descriptive action!	2002-05-10

If Daniel Sickles doesn't represent the master politician in this outstanding book about him, I don't know what would. This book definately gets to the details about the man's polictical and military careers. Swanberg writes about Sickle's early polictical organizing in Washington, his affairs with women, family, constructing a New York brigade and leading it to battle. If that is not intriguing enough, Sickle's story is also covered when it came to killing the man who was having an affair with his wife and how Sickle's polictical clout sets him free from prosecution. As much as his personal and polictical career is covered, his military career is as well. Swanberg's coverage how he organized, fought and defended his positions regarding his III Corp movement at Gettysburg is excellent which seemed to only cloud this already controversial character. As I read this very informative book, I couldn't believe the amount of lies, deception and self-importance this man had. His master plundering of others and fouled attempts to mask his true character is wrenching yet fascinating at the same time. Swanberg captured me in this book and I couldn't let it down. I feel it is probably the best book on Daniel Sickles out there.	2002-05-04

Pfanz is probably the premier choice when it comes to authors who cover the battle from start to finish. As I suspected from reading his Day #2 book first, this book was just as enlightening.  Pfanz careful honest attention to details, timelines, people and strategies are presented well.  I liked his attention in how he brings in a key person to a battle situation and not only do we get the fine details, but we also get a biography of that indvidual that helps build the story.  Pfanz doesn't miss any action from the build up of the Day #1 conflict and result.  Details about Confederate movement into town and the Federal defense such as the fight at Oak Ridge was very interesting.  Each regimental movement is carefully written about and covered.  To add more punch, maps are a bonus in the chapters that I found helpful to designate certain positions and movements.  I had questions in regard to Iverson's movements in the morning of the 1st which Pfanz covers since he doesn't miss any of the action.  Pfanz easily pieces the battle together as a lot of the action took place at the same time throughout the field.  Another helpful tool is the fact that Pfanz talks about the 1st and 11th Corps of the Union and brings them to the field as if they were coming up. He starts out writing about their earlier positions south of Gettysburg and the timeline is covered perfectly.  Pfanz also covers the Confederate beginnings of the 1st Day as well. Pfanz's stucture in presenting the many personalities that were involved in the conflict is outstanding! To get a great feel and total coverage for the 1st Day this is the must have book!	2002-05-02

Encouraged by his previous books I wanted to try this one. I was a bit discouraged by a novel-like writing although each story is based from history and tends build a great feel and understanding for the battle. In comparison to his Vicksburg book, this can not be done. If you are seeking a book based on events, dates, places, people and casualties this book isn't the one. If you are looking at a fictional character's account backed by history simply to feel certain aspects of the battle this is a great book. It reminds me of Shaara's Killer Angels about Gettysburg though doesn't live up to the expectations set by such a book. It is a mere attempt at fictional characters derived from actual history to portray events. On a brighter note, the writing is descriptive and truly places the reader on or at the events written.	2002-04-29

This is an interesting book regarding the state of mind of the wealthy and famous actor of the time.  The book carefully places his letters chronologically and also backs them by giving historic references and explanations of the events that surrounded the man.  How his &quot;flowery-like&quot; letters could ever hint at a man struggling with the problems of the country isn't told in them.  It's ironic from such writing that this man who had fame, fortune and social approval also had a deep and ever growing anger against northern politics.  His inner anger seemed depressed awaiting a chance to explode.  This book easily portrays Booth as a caring man yet also one who sympathized with the Southern cause. It briskly explains his premeditated thoughts of assassinating Lincoln and has little information regarding putting his thoughts into motion.  Yes, this book is about his letters and offers a quick coverage of the events surrounding Booth before and after the killing of Lincoln.  For those looking for a complete biography this book isn't the one.  For those looking for added insight who may have already read about Booth before, this is a great bonus of information.	2002-04-17

Just how did Grant take Vicksburg?	For some it may be unclear just how Grant finally took the city of Vicksburg and who to tell it wisely but Shelby Foote! Shelby Foote is probably one of the best authors of the Civil War around and it is certainly easy to understand why in this very informative book!  Foote carefully explains all engagements in and around Vicksburg that eventually come to light towards the finish.  Every event is descriptively written covering many naval strategies along the Mississippi, Yazoo and other rivers which were of importance to naval affairs of each opposing side. Grants struggles to capture the city are indeed covered by many in depth chapters which cover the naval and land assaults.  Also to help build the story, strategic moves in and around the city by Sherman and other generals make it easy to understand the Union grip upon Pemberton towards the end.  Another interesting part of this book was about Grant's personal dealings with daily life and how alcohol was a problem.  Besides just mentioning movements and battles in this book, condition of troops, officers and citizens of Vicksburg is also presented well.  Pemberton's decisions towards the end to surrender easily give the reader a true sense of desparation upon the part of Pemberton to seek help from Johnston for most of the seige which never came.  Such writing makes it clear of Pemberton's motives to defend yet finally surrender the city to Union forces as a the stranglehold is built up from the start of the book and to the end!	2002-04-12

Taylor's approach to covering the history of the Confederate struggle is encouraging to read.  Though the title of this book tends to be a bit misleading.  It should be called Four years of Confederate history.  Taylor tends to describe battle movements and give calculations as to the manpower of divisions, brigades and regiments to a dragging sense.  This books I recommend highly for those trying to get an accurate count of soldiers available for each battle, how many were casualties, after battle net amounts,etc..  Rarely are daily affairs of Lee covered.  When I read this book I was disappointed to find out that it wasn't a book about General Lee and his daily livelyhood as I wanted to read about.  Since Taylor was Lee's secretary I thought who better than to describe Lee's motives, attitudes, triumphs and defeats?  Very rarely did Taylor ever mention Lee in this manner.  Not enough to capture the man and tell his story. This book is a quick refresh of battles and movements throughout the war of the Army of Northern Virginia which hardly fits being called Four Years With General Lee. Credit is due to Taylor's ability to calculate total manpower and army positions throughout the four years though falls way short in covering Lee.	2002-04-11

Watkins gives us a front line view of being a Confederate soldier and the struggles he took part of in.  He was only one in a few to be an original survivor in his regiment. He mentions his daily grind involving starvation, fighting, marching and staying alive.  This book gives a great first hand look at an ordinary Confederate soldier caught up in extraordinary times.  It is interesting to note how Watkins describes his conflicts and his friendships built with others.  He loses many he knows within battle and often talks about other soldiers.  In some cases he describes soldier offenses in which punishment is death for deserting.  He places you in the scene of his every conflict and we are fortunate for having such a writer be able to tell his tale.	2002-04-09

I haven't read a book in a long time that I actually really enjoyed every chapter.  Biling's doesn't confuse the reader with battlefield strategy or complicating the obvious. He doesn't reflect on battle scenarios with upmost detail after 20 years either.  This is a great book for anyone looking to learn about daily soldier life.  Bilings captures the daily grind and life of being a Federal soldier while offering humor and straight forward realities that get the mind ticking.  The stories make truth stranger than fiction and is a welcomed charge of quick information.  It is easy to suggest this book to younger readers as well as the information is clean,concise and well written.  I would definately recommend this book for all as many ages can benefit from this educational and entertaining book of soldier life.	2002-04-05

I wish this book had more of them.  I was a bit disappointed in getting this hardcover to see that I could read it in a couple of days.  The pages go by fast as they cover Morgan's daring raids throughout Kentucky and the north.  I was hoping to get more information than the quick coverage of the events that Morgan and his raiders went through.  I would have liked to get some insight from his companions in the field and also from his enemy.  This book seems to summarize Morgan and probably isn't the best when it comes to dates and details. It is important to suggest this book for anyone looking to read about a different Confederate cavalry commander instead of Mosby or Stuart that doesn't want to get into serious details.  Perhaps this book exemplifies Morgan himself.  It was short and fast.  Morgan started his command quickly and finished quickly.	2002-04-05

Often I looked for the harsh realities of war to be written about though it seems many wouldn't write of such horrors back home.  What made the book interesting was the fact that very little description was ever written about such large scale battles as Antietam or Gettysburg in which Matrau took part of.  This book gives the reader a first hand glance at how soldiers communicated.  Matrau didn't want those at home to worry about him and often left out many details I preferred to read about.  This book is a rather quick read though informative about the 6th Wisconsin and their hardships endured throughout the war.  It carefully explains how this regiment shrank or was placed with other outfits meshed in the Iron Brigade.  Being a shorter book of 140 or so pages, it may lacks high details though it's simply not a history book.  It's a copy of letters sent back home and is intended truly for that.	2002-04-02

This book does some share interesting view points of the struggles that ocurred in early July in and around Gettysburg.  The amount of facts and different events shared tries to nail some of the popular questions surrounding the battle and it's aftermath.  Questionable moves by JEB Stuart, Chamberlain at Little Round Top are next to questions raised by soldier accounts of Pickett's Charge.  What happened? What were the stories they had? How many?, etc..  As much as I appreciated this book for the attempts made in clarifying actual events that happened it also arose further questions and doubt about which story to actually believe.  Yes, history has been altered by personal accounts and movies, but none of the authors seem to stand on one idea.  As much as this book is written well, I didn't enjoy reading about the battle in general.  Sometimes a general overview of the battle was written in that for myself seemed great for the first-time visitor or reader.  I was completely bored reading about the basic events of the battle over again that this book liked to cover.  I would suspect that this book was written for those who had a higher knowledge of the battle, though at times it gets very generalized in detail for the novice reader.  This book is something that people just learning about Gettysburg would probably not buy anyway because they would have been looking for a rounded view of the battle not details about certain events.  Mixing the over generalized information in with this book would have cut it's content down in half.  I appreciate what the author was attempting with this book and would have preferred more in depth content therefore I reasoned a 3 Star rating.	2002-03-29

Ransom's Andersonville is such a interesting first-hand account of the daily miseries of being a Union prisoner.  Ransom mentions his stay in Richmond before being transferred to Andersonville, Georgia.  He also describes his daily affairs, hardships, horrors and escapes with much detail.  Due to the horrid conditions of the camp, details are captured by Ransom and are sometimes quite graphic.  Ransom thought that someday his diary would reach others and certainly didn't want others not to know what hardships actually carried on daily.  His vivid descriptions of camp life and his own personal battle of deteriorating health encompasses the reader in this book. His daring escape after being released from Andersonville while being shipped to another southern prison is another gripping tale that awaits the reader in this very interesting story.  It's a great book about humanity and suffering.  One wonders how people can inflict such burden upon prisoners, though by 1864 the supply withered Confederacy only created further havoc for those contained.  This book is a graphic tale of Andersonville and an important asset to explaining Civil War History.  5 STARS!!	2002-03-26

John Gordon's book is an important book to read for those trying to gain an understanding of the Civil War and a perspective of a individual that had been involved in multiple engagements. From the start, Gordon writes about raising the Racoon Roughs and their start in Georgia which carries the reader chronologically throughout various battles. His service to the Confederate cause is covered well from his early beginnings to his involvement with General Lee in the surrender at Apomattox. This book is an important tool for understanding the fairness and qualities of Gordon and his sympathies for the people involved in the Civil War be it North or South. His character in speaking about individuals involved is fair and truly demonstrates that he wasn't just another 'racist' that fought for the South which is typical of only today's modern society. It is a must read for those looking to get into the mind of a great Southern leader. I would have rated this book 5 stars if Gordon would have only covered his involvement in the Civil War instead of writing reports on battles he wasn't involved with, though shaped the outcome of the Civil War. It would have better in my opinion if the book didn't get into explaining other battles or problems which Gordon had not took part in since it didn't appear that those other situations affected him.	2002-03-11

The amount of facts,details and personal stories of individuals caught in the fray of battle is superior to other books on the subject.  While Pfanz captures the horrors of chaos in battle it is backed by descriptive narration which allows the reader to feel the impact.  It is hard not to feel or imagine being a witness on the various fields and skirmishes taking place due to Pfanz's absolute detail of the action.  This book covers the entire events of Day #2 from start to finish.  On another note, the book seems to have a pro-northern flavor as more is covered from the Northern perspective.  As Union troops come to the field or organize for battle, more is covered from their vantage point than from view or thought structure of Lee's second day attacks.  I would have liked to see the material more balanced when it came to the content, but overall this book is a must have for anyone interested in knowing more detail on the Battle of Gettysburg!	2002-02-22

Coco's devotion for giving the reader the cold hard truths and facts regarding the treatment of the Confederate dead is excellent.  Not only is this book informative, but it also mentions various true stories of Confederate soldiers that died on the battlefield or who were mortaly wounded.  Actual burial places of the soldiers are covered as well.  Coco points out places along the battlefield where rows of the Confederate fallen were laid to rest.  He also covers attempts by families to capture or find their deceased father, son or brother.  Coco's book gives credit to where it is deserved as Confederates were not properly looked after or interred as Union soldiers were in the National Cemetary in Gettysburg.	2002-02-14

Hurst biography captures early turning points in Forrest's life that created and molded the controversial character in the man.  From an early age Forrest displays loyalty, kindness, courage and stands up to opposition with a fierce relentless fight.  The information Hurst offers is outstanding. Details about Forrest's business dealings with slavery and creating wealth in the trade is backed by numbers, dates and places.  As tensions grew in the south and the outlook of war became a strong possibility, Hurst tells about Forrest's early beginnings and his strong involvement in organizing men to defend their homeland.  Forrest's genuine way of doing things \\"his way\\" through leadership and personal passions are covered entirely as the war progresses.  The reader gets a sense that this man not only is fighting the war and defending his home state, but the man is defending social morals of the south and the southern way.  This is demonstrated and constantly proven in the book as Forrest not only fights the enemy, but also other southern higher ranking military personel. Forrest's never ending devotion is furthered by Hurst's carefully written timeline, details and dates while memoirs are backed from Forrest's friends and foes.  Interesting detail is given about the early battles and struggles Forrest faced in developing, organizing and running an effective cavalry throughout the western campaigns in the south.  His battlefield psychology and brilliance is certainly covered.<br />It is easy to get a feel from the writing that people either hated or loved the man.  The military campaigns covered are very well documented though a need for maps would have greatly complimented the intricate details of such actions for the reader.  Hurst's descriptions of the battles and Forrest's actions are an important asset as the war takes great tolls on the man mentally and physically.  As the war comes to a bitter end and chaos remains to hold many hostage in Tennessee, Hurst writes about Forrest's involvement in the early beginnings of the Ku Klux Klan.  His pursuit to better the life for many conflicts with him as he fails at business ventures and wants to become politically involved.  His polictical life is tarnished from the negative dealings of the KKK and also questionable military campaigns orchestrated towards the later part of the war.  Hurst definately dwells on Forrest's polictical career to an almost dragging sense.  As the book had offered more of the early Forrest's pshyche, it lags in the second half.  More of Forrest's personal life was something I wanted to read more about instead of polictical turmoil in Tennessee that this book seemed to over state.  Overall, the book is a must read for those interested in the Nathan Bedford Forrest. As much as this book built up his personality, it also seemed to lose that flavor towards the end as it seemed to cover more of the social issues while Forrest became a second character.  I would have reasoned a higher rating of 5 stars had it not been for that.war comes to a bitter end and chaos remains to hold many hostage in Tennessee, Hurst writes about Forrest's involvement in the early beginnings of the Ku Klux Klan.
