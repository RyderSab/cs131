Most people probably realize that the entire premise of this mystery series is stupid and ridiculous. These books are a great read when desiring to restore one's sense of balance, zen, and sense of humor, but not much else. In this latest entry Brown sermonizes more than usual. She preaches down at the reader about health, animal rights, the government, and allowing horse race betting in the state of Virginia.<br />Brown has actually emproved on two points however: 1) she finally realizes, I suspect, that Cynthia Cooper in fact isn't a police officer as she insisted upon calling Cooper in so many of the earlier books but is, rather, a deputy sheriff; and 2) Brown is starting to treat Sheriff Rick Shaw with a lot more wit and intelligence. In this book he is a lot more than the dimwit we were led to believe he was in the earlier books.<br />It is amazing how, in these books, Harry has managed to so brazenly defy Postal regulations for so long. Harry is long overdue for a change.<br />The interaction between Harry and her neighbors take up more space than the actual mystery does. A big disappointment.	2004-05-31

It will stand the test of time in its own right and will probably stand with &quot;McNally's Chance&quot; as the two best entry's to be contributed by Lardo to the McNally lexicon. But don't count on it winning any of the awards given to mystery writers by their peers.	2004-02-03

This entry in the McNally Saga is a bit of a let-down -- especially coming right after Lardo's &quot;McNally's Dilemma&quot; which is probably the all time best McNally novel. In &quot;McNally's Alibi&quot; we get to see Archy take leave of his senses. The only time he seems to do anything right is in trying to pick up Officer Georgy O'Hara, which he does quite nicely. I agree with those who think Connie Garcea needs to take a hike. That one has outlived her welcome. It is time Archy got a new love interest.<br />Hopefully what we saw in this novel won't happen again.<br />If you really must read this book then do so. But borrow it from the local library instead of buying it and spend your money on something more worthy of your attention.	2004-01-27

This one is probably the best read in the entire McNally series to date.

This is a particularly fine entry in the Heaven Lee lexicon, but the ending is reminiscent of the b-movie madman-seeks-revenge mind set. Given the state of mind and condition Heaven is left in on the last page one has to wonder if there is going to be an eighth novel in this series.<br />But don't dispare, read the novel anyway and enjoy it.

As this novel demonstrates there is a slight but noticeable difference in the writing styles of both Sanders and Lardo. Lardo himself seems to be a bit of a mystery man in that there isn't much publically known about him. He certainly doesn't have the reputation as a mystery writer that Sanders does.<br />MeNally amply demonstrates in this novel that he has very little common horse sense when it comes to women. He needs to learn how to be more selective.<br />If you really want to read this book borrow it from the library and read. Then move on to something else.	2003-12-28

Instead of giving us riviting, cliff-hanging mystery suspense we are dealt an emotionally distraught, manic-depressive, and very parinoid, woman not worth the paper she is written on. Instead of ground-breaking inroads into what could be news hights of detective fiction we are given a rehash of Ellery Queen's unstable mental problems. <br />And one would think Lucy would know better than to so cavalierly reck an expensive and well built helicopter.<br />&quot;Blow Fly&quot; isn't a mystery novel; it is a psychoprattling thriller with no coherent ending.<br />It is bad enough Cornwell insisted upon getting involved in the Jack-the-Ripper debate. Now she is meddling with the Princess Diana controvery. Nor she has ever bothered using the research she did in Jamestown, Virginia, in her novels like her former web site had pompously promised. And speaking of her web site, the present incarnation is only a shadow of its former self. <br />It is indeed time for Cornwell to move on to greener pastures. If she wants to keep writing there is always Andy Brazil; or better yet, she can become a columnist for the New York Times.	2003-11-30

It is proving a let-down after having waded through the four deadly sin novels by the same author. Maybe the series will improve with age. If you still want to read, get the books in paperback. Otherwise borrow them from the local library.<br />One of the major merits of this series is that it is written from the perspective of the playboy himself rather than the perspective of a third person.

For those who haven't bothered to notice: it you would compare the physical descriptions of Spenser with the pictures of Parker on the back of the dust jacket you will get the distinct impression Parker is basing Spenser to a great degree on himself. Spenser, as he has said himself, was with MacArthur at Inchon. This makes him at least 70.  <br />This latest entry is a bit of a letdown. No mention is made of Spenser's cooking abilities. And absolutely nothing is said about the details of the deal Spenser made with the aging crime boss at the end of the novel.<br />This novel is a pleasant, but like another reviewer has said already: if you really want to read it borrow it from the local library or get it in paperback when it comes out.	2003-10-28

I agree with those who advise that this is not the book to start reading the Peabody series with if you have never read any of the previous 14 books. To those who have, I suggest that this one is a refreshing entry in the series. If nothing else it serves to keep both the author and the characters out of a rut. Yes, it is a whole lot more domestic than previous adventures considering this is the first \\"family reunion\\" in years.

This one may be one of Sanders better books over all, but it isn't quite as good as \\"The First Deadly Sin\\" or \\"The Second Deadly Sin\\". It is unfortunate Sanders didn't see fit to write about the deadly sins 5, 6 and 7. This shows a lack of foresight on his part. Of the four we do have \\"The Second Deadly Sin\\" is probably the best. \\"The Third Deadly Sin\\" is a bit tiring but still holds one's interest. And lets face it, Delaney will never be a gourmet cook, but he is wild about sandwiches. Amen brother!<br />One has to have a stalwart stomach to really enjoy the Delaney series. If you aren't particularly bothered by the rather pathetic attempts at psycoanalysis (which Sanders would have done better to have left out) you will probably really like this novel.<br />Unlike in \\"The First Deadly Sin\\" (pride) and in \\"The Second Deadly Sin\\" (covetousness), it is difficult to figure out in \\"The Third Deadly Sin\\" exactly which sin Sanders is talking about. I  figure it is either envy or anger. My choice would be anger.	2003-03-25

As some reviewers of Rita's works have suggested before: Rita is a good read for those with nothing better to do; those wanting someting light, and perhaps amusing, to read as a change of pace; or those in transit with an excess of downtime on their hands and nothing else to do but read. The animals who are supposed to be the stars of this series are getting quite brazen in their actions. In &quot;Cat on the Scent&quot; Rita would have us believe these things actually drove Blair's car to Harry's place with Blair in the driver's seat and unconscious. In this book she would have us believe they went after Harry's attacker with a skateboard on one ocassion; and thoroughly clawed another attacker into submission on a second ocassion. I don't buy this and neither should anyone else. <BR>   If you really must insist upon reading this sorry excuse for a serious mystery borrow it from your local library like I did with the copy I read.	2002-07-01

Our favorite quack (Rita) has really gone overboard this time. As one of the previous 30 reviewers has so correctly and eloquently stated, in this novel Rita has gone out of her way to preach down at her readers with her trite and totally unnecessary social commentary. Nor do I appreciate Rita deliberately and maliciously bashing the Civil War reinactments which are put on here in the South on a regular basis. Personally, I could care less if she, as an individual, doesn't like them. But, frankly, it isn't her place to publically denounce them.<br />Like some of the other reviewers, I found the actions of Harry's pets in this novel to be outlandish, off base and out of line. Having these animals drive Blair's expensive car, with Blair unconsious and bleeding in the driver's seat, is carrying the matter too far. If Rita thinks any reasonable reader is going to take this as valid, it is perhaps time for her to retire.<br />If you must insist upon reading this nonsense don't waist your money on it. Go to your local library and read their copy -- then complain about their waisting the public's money on it.	2002-06-27

There are precious few really good scenes in this first entry of the Murphy mystery series. These scenes are enjoyable in their own right. But, in themselves, they don't make this book worth reading, let alone buying. And this book certainly doesn't inspire me to go out and read any of Rita's other, non Murphy mystery, books.<br />Given the fact that being a sheriff here in the Commonwealth of Virginia means running for office every four years, one has to wonder how Rick Shaw got into office in the first place, let alone staying in office for twelve years. And what, pray tell, is he doing issuing Harry a gun on page 219? At no point in this book are we told she knows how to use one, let alone having a permit to carry one.	2002-06-23

It is a good thing I didn't bother with the 15 reviews preceeding mine before I read through this book. As of this date the majority of those who have read these reviews and bothered to vote on them have not found any of them helpful even though the book has received a perfect, stellar, rating. And it is also a rather good thing that I am able to get this &quot;mystery&quot; series in the paperback swap section of my local library. It certainly isn't worth spending good money on. Rita is the only mystery author I know of who has the audacity and mendacity to give a sales pitch for merchanise tie-ins at the end of every book in her series. Bad form.<br />Just exactly who is dear Rita trying to kid with the likes of Jody Miller?  Jody's behavior is at the very least outragious and nobody bothers to find out why. Nor is there any indication that serious efforts were made to find out who really gave her that shiner. It must really be nice being a juvenile delinquent in Rita's version of Crozet.	2002-06-07

I would agree that it is never made quite clear why Kinsey is on someone's hit list, and one has to pretty much read between the lines to find a rational explanation as to why the culprit commited the crimes against the family of Kinsey's client, but life isn't always going to give us what we want. <br />I wouldn't go so far as to say Kinsey is a hard-boiled detective, but it certainly seems she gets banged around as though she were one. I would hope she is physically stonger than is let on in the series or she might not last long enough to make it through Z.<br />Given her experience with two different dead-beat husbands you would think Kinsey would know better than to have a one night stand with her body guard.<br />This series is one of the lighter mystery series on the market these days. It also happens to be a rather good one. If you want top of the line read Agatha Christie or Rex Stout. If you don't much care how ridiculous matters can get read Tamar Myers or Rita Mae Brown. But, if you enjoy a good read which is entertaining, enjoyable, and still manages to keep you in some supense, then here is the series for you.<br />This novel may not be the best in this particular series but it is still fun to read.	2002-03-18

We are again seeing some of the prose for which Parker is noted. But he is assuming that everyone of his fans know enough about baseball to understand what he is talking about. There are places in the text with Jesse on the field where it is plainly hard to follow the action, especially at the beginning of the novel. Towards the middle and the end it isn't so bad.<br />For an alcoholic who is &quot;trying&quot; to recover, Jesse certainly makes a point of drinking a great deal. At least his ex-wife talks him into getting some help.<br />But this novel gets better as it progresses.

Several other reviewers have made a point of calling this novel Parker's homage to the movie &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;. Like many others, I enjoyed that movie. I even enjoyed the first sequel to it. What I didn't enjoy were the second and third sequels which had absolutely nothing to do with the original and were plainly lousy movies.<br />Lets kindly get real. This novel stands on its own and has nothing to do with &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; or any other movie. <br />The typos in this novel are obvious. The proof readers at Parker's publisher apparently did a poor job. It is also obvious that Spenser is modeled after his creator. Spenser, at age 70, acts like someone half his age. He needs to start thinking about retiring. As a classic womanizer before he met Susan Silverman in the second novel of the series, Spenser seems oblivious to the fact that there may well be some illegitimate children in his past no one is being told about. And given the fact that Spenser is a gourmet cook, does anyone wonder why there is no Spenser cookbook on the market?<br />This novel is only slightly better than &quot;Hugger Mugger&quot;. But in spite of all these faults it is still a good read.<br />If Parker's readers want him to do a better job with Spenser, then perhaps they ought to write to him through his publisher and express their concerns directly to the sourse. Just maybe he will get the message.	2002-02-10

I enjoyed reading this novel, but I am not about to take it seriously. I wonder what would happen if Wambaugh ever co-authored a mystery novel with Patricia Cornwell in which one of his versions of a cop worked closely with Kate Scarpetta (in her current paranoid, very near nervious, and very mental, breakdown condition) in trying to solve an intriguing and highly invoved case.	2002-02-03

This cookbook is well done and should serve the fans of Kate Scarpetta well. Presuming Cornwell continues to dazzle us with competent Scarpetta novels without loosing her edge perhaps she will grace us with volume two of this cookbook after she has published volume 25 in the Scarpetta saga.

Rita is indeed trying to milk as much money out of this franchise as possible. The sales pitch at the end of the book is at best exceedingly self serving. Only the truely gullible would be stupid enough to believe it. Perhaps it is time Rita informs her devout fans how much money her merchandise and book sales generate for the animal welfare league. And I rather doubt Rita is as bad off financially as Sneaky Pie would have you to believe. Her closets are probably packed full with expensive clothes -- a lot more expensive than what a lot of her fans can afford in their own wardrobes.<br />This particular novel has no substance worth mentioning.

The obvious denegrading of Southern Culture is also uncalled for.<br />On top of all this Cornwell insists upon writing in a style which obviously emulates Joseph Wambaugh. Mind you, she does a superb job of it without infringing upon his territory. But she should have stuck to her own turf.<br />The only really credible character in the entire volume is Andy Brazil -- a character Cornwell manages to screw up inspite of herself.

I only hope Cornwell acts quickly to re-invent Scarpetta or she may soon have to stop writing Scarpetta novels, if for no other reason than Scarpetta fans becoming pernamently disallusioned with the character.

She chose a too common place a title for the book and she has Sam barking up the wrong tree with the company he keeps in the world of ghosts. The book is a good read but these and some other things we can simply do without.	2001-09-22

In spite of their falts they are excellent reads. Janek is a pragmatice cop who doesn't loose sight of his humanity. He represents a lot of what todays cop should be like. You will enjoy this novel in spite of its rather somber seting.	2001-09-19

I don't normally read police procedurals but this one is an exception. &quot;Wallflower&quot; is by far the best of the Janek novels. It also has the least amount of sex in it of the three. If Bayer had left the better part of the sex to the reader's imagination in all three novels he would have done even better. This is a great read, especially for those who would profer to avoid Ed McBain and/or Joseph Wambaugh but would still like some balance in their mystery reading. If you enjoy the Janek novels as I have you will also enjoy the seven movies based on these books.	2001-09-19

One can easily believe that this stuff realy goes on in the real NYPD. Eisheid would make a particularly good shady politician in civilian life. Unfortunately, he practices being a politician in one of those organizations where it doesn't really belong. Eisheid is really good at what he does, he simply isn't a good cop in the process. The only things he realy cares about is saving face and saving his position at work. Public beware.	2001-09-19

If you are interested in reading about what a good cop looks like then this novel is for you. One has to wonder why Bayer wrote only three novels in the Janek lexicon. But you can at least enjoy the ones we have.	2001-09-19

Helen really out did herself with this entry in the Hollis Ball/Sam Wescott mystery series. And she couldn't have selected a better subject to do it with. It is high time someone poked some honest fun at all the Elvis impersonations. But Helen is still slow in giving her readers the depth of characterization that both Hollis and Sam deserve. This isn't to say she isn't trying or that she isn't making progress. Somewhere along the line she just seems to be missing the boat.<br />     It appears this could easilly be the last in the Hollis Ball/Sam Wescott series. Chappell stated in an interview she was having problems finding a publisher for entry number 5 in the series. Chould it be that even Hollis and Sam are giving up the ghost? I would be disappointed but I could easily get over it if Hollis doesnt' stop wallowing in the mud so much.	2001-09-16

Helen Chappell isn't a nationally known author, though she could easily become one with this series. It is indeed rare to find a quack as both a heroine and as an amateur sleuth. And it is an abolutely great idea to have a ghost as her partner -- especially if the ghost happens to be her long lost husband. Helen does well with this first novel in the series but she leaves a nagging feeling that she simply isn't up to the challenge. This book is a great start for a woman who basically isn't a very good, or a very convincing, writer. If you enjoy a good change of pace this is the book for you.	2001-09-16

It is indeed unfortunate that the books in this series are going out of print so soon after being published. It is an excellent series which deserves to be remembered. It is too bad Hollis is being better developed as a character than her husband's ghost is. Helen's readers deserve very well rounded and complete characters who are worth their effort to read about and who are capable of not only carrying on delightful conversations, but who are constantly doing the unexpected as well. And it is also too bad that pointing out the fallacies of the newspaper business on a regular basis aren't being given the attention they deserve. Helen is trying her best to present this in a witty and sardonic manner but she doesn't always succeed. This can be done without detracting from the mystery at all but apparently Helen isn't up to the challenge.	2001-09-16

I read this book out of curiosity and found it a little too crude for my taste. Both Kinsey Millhone and Spenser have probable cause for making glib, and sometimes crude, wisecracks. Magdalena Yoder doesn't. If anything, she may be in need of a good psychologist. And cats no doubt make fine pets but there has got to be something wrong with the way this broad carrys her's around. I probably won't be reading the rest of the books in this series any time soon.	2001-09-09

Rita, as an author, reminds me of cotton candy -- sweet, full of empty calories and no substance. Harry will never be in a position to emulate J. B. Fletcher. She exhibits more sense than Rick Shaw (who is a sheriff in name only) does but she is in the bad habit of &quot;solving&quot; crimes more in spite of herself than anything else. This novel is no exception.	2001-09-09

The closest Rita will ever get to emulating &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; is in the title of this book. The similarities end there. Anyone can write about the illicit drug trade, a subject Rita should have had the good sense to stay away from. She added nothing to the discussion worth reading. And she still doesn't know what she is talking about when it comes to law enforcemnt.	2001-09-02

I usually enjoy reading about quirky characters but Yoder is more of a quack instead. She pretends to be off beat when in reality she is actually off base. It would be nice indeed if Tamar Myers stops writing about Yoder and did somthing else altoghether. This is the first Yoder mystery I have read. I am not going to be in any hurry to read any of the others.	2001-09-02

It is also obvious that Wambaugh is well qualified to write about cops. But even when the cops he writes about are supposed to be the heroes of the novel they still tend to be raunchy. And this is one of his more graphic novels. God help us all.	2001-08-30

Rita took a good idea and proceeded to botch it royally in this novel. I found it difficult to follow her train of thought in explaining why a 175 year old murder had any relevance at all to the person who kills the archeologist in charge of the digs at Monticello. That person must have been exceedingly appalled at finding out their family tree is the result of Miscegenation -- and that with a slave of Thomas Jefferson. Next, I suppose, Rita will be trying to justify a forced apology by Whites to Blacks for slavery (something which none of us living today have any control over what-so-ever 136 years after it ended in this country).      There are some points in the dialogue throughout the novel in which Rita was simply lecturing the reader.	2001-07-08

Unlike some others, I will never put Brown in the same league as Agatha Christie. Brown is so sophomoric in comparison. If you want to read a really good mystery, read Christie. If you want to be merely entertained by a mystery, read Lilian Jackson Braun's &quot;The Cat Who...&quot; series. Braun is a better writer than Brown. She even has a better imagination. If you want purely escapist fare in your mysteries then Brown is precisely the ticket you want. In this particular novel, Brown took a perfectly good idea or two and proceeded to be perfectly mediocre in her treatment of it.	2001-07-08

For all his philosophical ramblings in the first chapter, the author fails to accomplish what he thinks and says he has set out to do.

To those who have read Parish's long list of publications it is obvious he didn't write &quot;The Unofficial Murder, She Wrote Casebook&quot; as a bonafide fan of the series. He wrote it as an addition to his list of conquests as a writer on things Hollywood. I like watching the &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; reruns on A &amp; E myself. In comparing what Parish writes in the episode descriptions with what goes on in the corresponding episode being aired on TV it is becomming increasingly apparent there are more mistakes in the book than perhaps Mr. Parish would like to admit to. This isn't to say the book is totally useless -- it just means beware of the pitfalls and proceed accordingly. Mr. Parish has done mystery lovers a disservice by not being more careful with his subject matter.	2001-02-18
