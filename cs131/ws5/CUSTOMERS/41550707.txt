Any one hooked on the new TV show Medium will want to read Ghostly Antiques by Jennifer Robins. This readable novel can be enjoyed in one sitting. I know.

Set in California I was struck by the comparison of America, the illegal alien teenage mother to be and the upper class male Delaney who both seem to struggle with homesickness (America yearning for Mexico and Delaney for New York) while they attempt to adapt to all that California is supposed to mean to them. <br />Then there are Candido, America's husband and Kyra, Delaney's wife who don't fight it and accept their roles in this land of opportunity that is California (Candido simply wanting to work to live and Kyra the workaholic not knowing how to relax and be fun). <br />This juxtaposition of homesickness for what was familiar and acceptance of the norms of California society give the novel the right combination to grab the reader by the throat and strangle them with the reality of California lifestyles;the plastics and the poorest of the poor. <br />BRAVO TC Boyle!BRAVO!	2005-02-14

What a wonderful diary type autobiography of a life filled with problem after problem and how this survivor rises above the low points to see a different way to cope with it all.

Not since I was a teenager and slipped Beula Land off the book shelf and hid in my room to devour the pages have I been sucked into a good old steamy southern soap operish saga. Two thumbs up to author K.A. Schneider and his historical romance novel The Scent of Magnolias and Men. This book gives romance readers the usual formulaic fare along with the earthiness found in another book I dearly love, Erskine Caldwell's Tobacco Road. The love story is tender and the conflicts come at you so frequently you feel you need to take cover. I read this riveting release in one day. Outstanding!	2005-02-01
US	41550707	R7CZKYXE3YZ62	0142003808	28976631	Drop City	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Drop everything and read Drop City	Drop City is the third T.C. Boyle novel I have read and I can't stop shaking my head. Being able to put ones imagination into the bowel of each plot and create a story that is believeably specific to that time period and social scene is genius. <br /> <br />Okay, so that kind of talent is great, but the author is also able to make the reader laugh themself silly too. What an amazing combination in a novelist, which has made Boyle my new favorite author. <br /> <br />Drop City takes me back to the early 70s during a time when I too was involved in the not attainable free love era. Everything comes with a price and Boyle demonstrates this brilliantly in Drop City. <br /> <br />Take for example naming the novel Drop City. Folks dropping city life for a life of isolated communal engagement is fun for a while, but the following excerpt from page 344 says it beautifully, \\" Star had a vision of the future then, of the winter, music-less, dull as paste, everybody crowded into a couple of half-finished cabins with no running water and no toilets and getting on each other's nerves while the snow fell and the ice thickened and the wind came in over the treetops like the end of everything.\\" <br /> <br />Boyle also blows me away with his ability to take unlikeable people and make the reader give a lick about them. I was drained dry by the time I was finished with the book. I will be thinking about my visit to California and Alaska via the pages of Drop City for years to come. <br /> <br />Outstanding! <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-05

A Mouse Among us is Allen Parker's second book and the second book of his I have had the pleasure to be exposed to. Not only did I read them quickly because they have that can't put it down quality to them, I appreciate his gift for physical dark humor,which to me is hard to write.

To read a novel and be interupted by your own fits of laughter means a good read to me. <br />The Road to Wellville is one of the funniest novels I have had the pleasure of enjoying.  <br />T C Boyle is brilliant. This author does the math, I mean the research...then spins his creative magic into pure gold. <br />I find myself thinking about his made up characters blended with the real characters in The Road to Wellville thinking they are ALL the real deal, the sign of success in the fictional world. <br />As a recent fan of Boyle's darkly humorous work I already know I won't ever be able to get enough of the stuff...keep 'em coming TC!	2004-11-30

As a recent appreciator of TC Boyle's genius I saw the movie Road to Wellville, read the novel and then read Boyle's latest offering, The Inner Circle. <br />Reading The Inner Circle felt like a block of cement was firmly clutched in my hands weighing me down, down, down. I didn't say mill stone around my neck...I meant I voluntarily held onto that armload of cement and allowed it to lower me into that pit of dark, deep, weirdness that is the human animal, Boylestyle. <br />Not only am I a recent Boylie...I am in awe of the way this author fits his work into the appropriate time period and pulls it off...believably. <br />Okay, so the work is about a controversial giant who contributed to society's study of sexual matters. Boyle's fictional character--a made up assistant-- takes the reader into the world or the \\"inner circle\\" and maybe into much more than even the renowned researcher Kinsey would allow us to view;the experimentation and practicing of what was being studied; sex. Similar to the inside of a tornado, the circle spins into itself... stirs things up... and what is discovered isn't always pleasant, but a whirlwind of disturbing possibilities. <br />I am currently reading another Boyle book, Drop City. How does he do it? Don't know, just hope he continues to do, and to be.	2004-11-30

I recently had the opportunity to travel to Key West and visit the Hemingway estate. The tour guide talked about Hemingway being married and then his wife making a friend and soon after Hemingway was not married and with the ex-wife's friend. I think the tour guide said this happened more than once in the life of one of our most influential novelists. <br />Hmmm...I purchased Hemingway's The Garden of Eden and after reading it I couldn't stop myself from wondering if art truly does imitate life.  <br />Caught between two loves on his honeymoon--one plot of this novel-- had me pondering all kinds of possibilities and brought me back to one of the oldest stories that exists to man...the story of temptation in the garden...and choices...outstanding Hemingway work, my favorite one.	2004-11-30

Everything in life isn't black and white, whether we're talking about skin color or ways to think about life's issues. &quot;Colored Glass&quot; is an extremely well written chronicle of this time period and how skin color effected much of the dealings between people in the South. The Klan, the social settings, the mindsets all played an almost too large a role in the way people lived their lives. What we have on &quot;Colored Glass&quot; is a beautiful story teaching us lessons without us knowing it about the way things were, are and should be. Everything isn't black and white...&quot;Colored Glass&quot; to me symbolically shows the type of adornment on graves of people with color as well as the fragile shattering nature of the way society treated and still does treat a large segment of the population, and how sad that is.

When an author can write about two lonely boring people and make me want to do nothing else but read the book, makes me know she has something special here. I not only didn't want to do anything else, I didn't want to read the last 26 pages because then it would be over and I was not ready to leave these two pathetically rich in every way characters author Aardal has created. Raises the question...can the lonely and boring expect to find happiness not being lonely and boring? Aardal has brilliantly crafted a tale about Internet meetings and the downside of taking two people who feel comfortable with their relationship in the cyber world and explore the consequences of taking the relationship to the non-cyberworld where they realistically may be comfortable with their boring and lonely selves.	2004-01-26

The disturbing imagery at times made me wonder about abused people and how they live in fear on a daily basis. It made me understand, and that's a good thing. And yet, Author Yarbrough is not writing a book based in reality, it's horror, fantasy. But...and this is big, it has so many parallels to real life, you get lost in the plot and forget for a while that it can't be real. Or can it? Excellent.	2003-12-18

Just as real as if glass did shatter, &quot;When the Glass Shatters&quot; delivers a chilling first hand account of the life of a domestic violence survivor. Beginning with the five year old witnessing her parent's abusive relationship the story follows the shattered life as she grows into a damaged adult. Page after page takes the reader deeper into the psyche of the cut up existence that makes up the victim's life. As dark as it gets and almost hopeless feeling, the light does shine through the shard of brokeness in the end. This story educates and enlightens; depresses and yet gives hope to all effected by lives lived in violent situations. Never again will you ask, &quot;Why not just leave?&quot; The answers are seldom that clear when individuals are prisoners of others who handle life irrationally and with anger. This book is a crash course in understanding domestic violence 101 and a must read for everyone.If you aren't a victim or a perpetrator, you probably know someone who is. Understanding is the first step to raising up out of the broken shatteredness that results in being damaged by mistreatment. OUTSTANDING!	2003-09-30

It is fluid, and by that I mean the flow takes the reader down an-only-ending-at-the-last-page raft ride; smooth as well as invigorating...And the characters are so well defined and described you are convinced you know them and they are real, not made up. I will be thinking about this novel for a long time. The layers of possible things to ponder are endless...hatred in all races...brainwashing in all races...and understanding all cultures... and of course tolerance...It looks like there will be other novels in the future for main character Noah Winter and other social issues for Squires to interweave in another one if his epic tales...great reading to look forward to...Outstanding!	2003-09-14

Author Sherry Russell has written a book that should be required reading for everyone. In the throes of sadness and anxiety over losing a loved one or losing a job, a friend, a relationship with someone significant...these situations all fall under the mystique of subtracting a part from the whole of a person's being. What to do about this and how to cope is the crux of this wonderful 100 page masterpiece. Understanding the physical, mental and emotional realities effected by loss and how to handle these changes can make the difference between rising out of the dark hole and staying in it... Outstanding book, well written; the experience between the covers of this book for the reader is more like taking time to talk to a good friend than reading a book.	2003-07-31

With pleasure I write a review for &quot;My Little One&quot; by Nancy Rechtman. Rechtman has penned an outstanding novel tackling a not so funny topic (infertility) making it understandable and even humorous. As a woman who went through years of infertility concerns I applaude this author for writing about this devastating condition woman can suffer with. The thing needed during this depressing time in life is humor and &quot;My Little One&quot; is absolutely hysterical throughout and yet, poignant and heart wrenching, too. A true talent can professionally and effectively blend humor and tragedy and this author definitely can, and does it well. Two thumbs up!	2003-06-19

Even the title, &quot;How the West was Lost&quot; sets the reader up for the red man vs white man, buffalo chasing, laughfest they are in for with this delightful book. Albitz not only writes well, he writes for all audiences; not an easy thing to do if you want all readers to be equally entertained. I have every confidence all readers will...will what?

The message to me is clear, true love is color blind. April and May were of different races and classes in society, but they were as close as if they were born of the same mother. This closeness followed them all their days, even when they were only together in the letters they wrote to one another. This is an outstanding southern saga of a time when slaves were bought and sold and the master's family was expected to treat their property a certain way. Sisters Forever celebrates crossing the line; love is color blind.	2002-07-13

Mohrlang has crafted a story that takes the reader back 200 years to a land that was the epitome of uncivilized. This story feels real, seems authentic and true to the way it must have been back then in Sarawak, Malaysia. And if it isn't, the writer is so good at penning a novel, he makes it all unmistakingly believable. The senses are all entertained as well as satisfied with Mohrlang's knowledge of what he writes about. Descriptions are so attended to, the reader will want to taste the padi (rice) balls and fish wrapped in banana leaves and cringe when the blood oozes onto the parang (thick sword) during battle, of which there are many graphically portrayed throughout this amazing saga of life, death, conquest, social change, and savage vs. civilized.

I am a big fan of novels with more dialogue than detail, so Moskowitz made me happy as a reader right away when I cracked the book open.

The subject of adopted people wanting to discover who they are is near and dear to my heart, as I adopted my daughter when she was five and in the last year and a half have witnessed the mixed bag of emotions she and all involved have experienced in her discovery of her past. <BR>Paris tells a fabulous story about a twenty-one year old who finds out she is adopted and sets about to connect with her birth relatives. The dialogue is current and believeable, the descriptions so well written I was lost in the storyline and felt as if I was Alice falling through the mirror and had been transplanted right in the middle of her made up plot.

Les Blain has created an excellent mystery where the &quot;wolf&quot; is Detective Wolf, but then again it can mean a possible bad person amongst the sheep, any way...this is a great book. I recommend it.The mystery part blows you away; keeps you turning the pages. Blain describes in great detail the lifestyle of the &quot;sheep&quot; in a fundalegalist society of narrow minded Christians who really believe it is, &quot;their way or no way.&quot; Wolf has his work cut out for him when two women come up dead and they both have ties to the congregation of &quot;sheep.&quot; The wife of the leader of the group sums up the group's mindset when she says, &quot;I listen to him (her husband, the leader) the way a sheep listens to a shepherd. I wouldn't think of going against what he says.&quot; Hence, &quot;sheep&quot; may not be so innocent, more of the irony.The book is well written and the characters are delightful, especially Detective Wolf. There is humor, information about many religions, medical facts, police investigatory practices; in total it is a lot of story packed into one mystery. Outstanding.	2002-05-23

Hiding Behind the Collar by Catherine Britton Fairbanks is an extremely well written expose' into the disturbing reality of frequently covered up ministerial misconduct. Vulnerable parishioners looking for spiritual guidance too often become prey to self centered ministers, seemingly more interested in having faith put in themselves than in a supreme being. Fairbanks describes with meticulous detail the spidery web she was sucked into by a clever minister bent on becoming the only saving sanction to this needy searching soul. This author's self examination reaches out to include an examination into organized religion, in this case The Episcopal Church, politics and apathy concerning ministerial abuses of power over members of a congregation. Readers of this book will know what to look for when it comes to too much friendship, inappropriate exchanges, and questionable activities between ministers and themselves. After reading this book, I realize how easy it is for people to \\"hide\\" behind the collar of religious service and how devastating it is for the innocent victims to suffer lifelong negative side affects from this subtle, yet dangerous type of mistreatment. I applaud the author's courage to tell it like it was for her, with the hope that others are more aware and might be able to protect themselves from getting involved in this type of situation.	2002-05-14

I read the novel, What Hope Have You! by Elaine Bunbury because I am attracted to stories about racial injustice. I had no idea what I was in for, though. Growing up in the United States I experienced race riots, interracial relationships, and have often wished I was African American because I am disgusted by the way many white people treat black people. <BR>This book opened my eyes to even greater injustices in the world, the history of South Africa. Bunbury has written a brilliant, literary masterpiece; historically revealing and in my mind socially relevant in a world of daily struggles between the races, still. <BR>The author's description of the landscape, the language, the emotions of the cast of literally colorful characters in her epic novel will take any reader's breath not only away but suck it out of their body. <BR>I will be affected by this reading of Bunbury's novel for some time. The ironies involved in the hate that often fosters man made rules about separating races (Apartheid) and the insulting consequences of, in this book's case, a white man raping a black woman and the resulting lineage is beautifully portrayed in this magnificent story. <BR>The absurdity down the family line, because the origins were carefully hidden (passing for white, in other words)a man in the story is suddenly faced with scandal and the man made laws he supports ultimately rip the family apart: <BR>\\"Hetty(the man's wife) and the children will now be classified as coloured under the Population Registration Act. They'll have to leave my house!\\" <BR>The reality of the unfolding of the scandal of the woman who'd been raped being a relative, smacks(!) the man where he lives and what he'd been about; the laws, the separation. <BR>Bunbury wrote this story over twenty years and in a few days I read it; but I will be reliving it in my mind for years and will probably read it again some day. A treasure and a triumph! Outstanding!	2002-05-03

The true account of a young man struck with a rare disorder who spends each moment of his life giving to others; humbled me, moved me to tears, and reaffirmed my belief in the power of giving. When asked why he gives to others (in his case he gives toys to other kids who are stricken with debilitating, hospital confining conditions) he had the following to say, &quot;...some adults did the same thing for me (gave toys). I thought it was so nice that I wanted to do it, too. It made me feel better. It took my mind off my sickness. It kept me from feeling sorry for myself.&quot; Jarrett's joyful outlook on life has gotten him invites to the White House, appearances on major talk shows, and a following of &quot;believers&quot; in the importance of giving, too. This amazing young man is wonderfully portrayed in The Joy Cart by author Marvin Bartlett, who has written an exceptional chronicle of a modern day saint amongst us, a &quot;boy with his toys&quot; and his giving spirit. Outstanding book about an awe inspiring young man.	2002-05-01

After reading The Contingency of Power by Tracy Kiewel Sutterer I got an indepth look into the possibility of that kind of power between life partners:amazing concept! Characters Kincaid and Meghan share a connection that goes way beyond love and dating; it is \\"immersion\\" and they have the ability to actually read each other's mind, and feel what each other feels. <BR>After they met and connected on all levels, Meghan made the following comment: \\"Did you feel that? It was like our souls ...\\" \\"Intertwined,\\" Kincade said finishing her thought. Sutterer has crafted a lovely romantic tale, one that will have the reader saying , \\"Ah,\\" as they read. And even though this is a deep rooted love fest of a story, it has a bad guy who for reasons of his own wants the couple separated and each one dead. How does he believe he must go about this? \\"Ian had to take away any contingency of power the two might share.\\" And that is what he tries to do. <BR>The language used to create this tale of truest love is magical and made me feel warm and glad to be reading it. Sutterer shows a versatility in her writing ability to create a love story, and a story about heavy crime type issues of the Columbian drug connection kind. Outstanding!	2002-04-19

Did that make any sense? <BR>Well, an afternoon with Marcus's book Crispy will have you wondering if you said what you said or meant what you meant. Crispy is a zany ride through a cleverly crafted carnival cuisine of the uncouth of society. <BR>Throughout this tale, main character Charles Crisp attempts to avoid being \\"stupided\\" by characters Spider and Smokey. \\"You two idiots have no idea how happy you have made me ... and all you had to do is die!\\" This is what Crisp said at one point when he thought he'd finally gotten rid of the pair. <BR>But Spider and Smoky suffer their own frustrations with Crisp. \\"...you don't know what a total drag you are.\\" \\"Yeah man, you bum us out all the time. You gotta loosen up.\\" <BR>To me this book is a creative cross section of Americana; dysfunctional-style. We get a major glimpse into the un-Beaver Cleaver life styles of the inappropriate and irreverent; bikers, mentally ill patients, convicts, drug users and dealers. <BR>Marcus weaves cartoon mania ( I felt as if I was watching episodes of Road Runner being played out by the characters) with detective magazine writing (lots of cop interactions gone loco) and pulls it off with a sociological statement about the frustrating war on drugs. All this in 173 pages? Oh, did I forget to mention it is also hilarious? Outstanding job, H.B.	2002-04-06

US	41550707	R2F2GBS3AISQ6Q	1588512231	956325990	Return to Suicide	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Hauntingly beautiful	Allison Alexander's novella Return to Suicide is a hauntingly beautiful piece of literature. So many things work together in these 100+ pages of natural writing. It is the stuff of classics. Alexander tells a tale so tragically poignant it begs an emotional reaction from its reader; and certainly gets one. I actually burst into tears at one point. The author has written a story about the &quot;unwanted&quot; and the &quot;searching&quot; that is set in the Great Depression. Return to Suicide is reader friendly and yet has a sophisticated style. I will be affected for quite some time by this amazing book. Author Alexander's future in writing is one to keep track of. She is enormously talented.	2002-02-21

In this extremely well written book Dirschel describes hell in the following way: &quot;...the time spent there never changes and no matter how much you may feel prepared to face the day ahead, once you get there it is always so much worse than your worst anticipation. That is just the way it is.&quot;<BR>Simplicity is a story of the condemned of society being damned to hell, but in a twist of fate some are turned into vampires: &quot;Hell is a horrible place but at least for the vampire, it does go away.&quot;<BR>Dirschel does a brilliant job of allowing the reader to not only glimpse into the bowels of hell, according to his fictional accounting, he offers the age old story of the vampire life in a unique way; through the lives of two people who not only don't seem to fit in, they demonstrate that sometimes in hell, the &quot;hell&quot; they thought they'd experienced while still living pales in comparison.<BR>This horror novel seems to be a documentary of the fallen amongst the living who fall even farther on the other side, even as vampires. Preying on the underbelly of society by night, they are condemned to a &quot;living&quot; hell of tortuous acts against their feeling selves by day.<BR>At times the reader will want to read with only one eye open, much like the way horror films are often watched. The reader may even fell nauseous reading the pages of descriptions of the torture of the day because it is so well crafted.<BR>All the senses are brought to life with the reading of this journey into hell. And yet it is a love story of a different nature, so creatively woven it defies the reader to not believe it actually took place, knowing full well that vampires do not exist...or do they?<BR>The reader will be drained and have much to ponder about how they live their life: a poweful deterrent to not wanting to be condemned to hell everlasting is found within the pages of this phenomenalbook Excellent.	2002-02-17

Grass Dance by Laurel Johnson is a book that for a lack of a better way to put it to me is &quot;pure poetry.&quot; Johnson has crafted her true testimony type tale to be anything but: interweaving poems, memories, emotional peaks and valleys in her life into a book that makes this piece of literature a masterpiece of expression. It is perhaps meant as a Christian genre book, but it is more than that, much more. <BR>This book embraces the ups and downs of the time we spend on the earth in a beautiful way and gives the reader the hope and courage they may need to turn the pages in the book and in their own lives as well. I recommend this book highly. This is one book that the reader will probably want to read more than one time. Excellent!	2002-02-13

My daughter is living near her birth relatives at present and I have been experiencing some feelings of insecurity about our relationship.<BR>I finally followed the &quot;nudge&quot; and read the book.

US	41550707	R3QHGBENNI5VV8	1588513173	108153413	Ledgend's Prophecy	Books	5	0	1	N	N	fantasy with niceness	With all the publicity about fantasy books lately, Ledgend's Prophecy is right in style. What I discovered about this book is that it not only features wizards, magic belts, spells, sorcery and traditional fantasy elements: it dishes up some big scoops of &quot;niceness.&quot; Take for example some of the characters names: Faith, Hope, and Charity. It is almost as if the author is blending in biblical themes with the expected offerings of the fantasy genre. And the story has its share of evil bad characters, which helps to give a good contrast between the &quot;niceness&quot; of the good characters and the &quot;badness&quot; of the creepy characters: makes for just the right amount of conflict and resolution to stimulate and satisfy the reader. It is also easy to read and understand. Good story, author Tyrone Godfrey!	2002-01-08
US	41550707	RJCTS936AQHHD	1588515710	861591817	Spine	Books	5	5	6	N	N	A public education about public education	After reading Spine by F. E. Mazur I came away with the following: Spine is a public education about education. Mazur writes a detailed, well thought out expose' in fictional form of the sometimes tragic realities of the institution most of us (with the exception of home schoolers and perhaps some private institutions) have to be confined in for years out of our lives: public schools. Long gone are the days of the spinster school teachers living in the homes of their students with hickory sticks in their hands to maintain order. As depicted in Spine, today's teachers live a variety of different lifestyles and can no longer take discipline into their own hands like they used to be able to. What has not changed over the years is the expectation of the self righteous public to enforce those rigid moral standards from the olden days: and when there is a suspicion of inappropriate behavior, as there is in Spine, the people are likely to form a witch hunt and the subject of the hunt may feel forced to defend himself and feel oppression as he has never experienced it before. The difference in not allowing the teacher to take discipline in their own hands can present difficulties in dealing with extremely difficult cases, such as with one character in Spine. In this case, the teacher reacts inappropriately, but seems to feel backed in a corner with no way out but to use his clever tongue. Spine is definitely not for the light hearted reader, which also demonstrates that teachers are human: they may swear, drink, play cards, and think about sexual acts. And although Spine sent a definite social message to me, it was also very enjoyable to read, as Mazur has a wonderful grasp of the language and how to put words together to move the reader along and want to turn the page. Outstanding.	2002-01-02

But I learned towards the end of the book that this was only the custodial type part of the telling. The real miracle was in how this child has come to be the miracle in the family's life because of the lessons they have learned from her. Lori is retarded and the lessons she has taught the family have impacted their lives more than anything they could have learned in a book or been instructed about by learned scholars. Lori teaches what God wants us all to know: to listen to each other and love and attend to one other. This is what I, too, learned from John White's excellent telling of Lori's Miracle. This book will move the reader to tears and give them something so profoundly simple to take away from it that I believe my life has been truly blessed because I chose to read it.	2001-12-26

This review is by Lynn Barry, author of Puddles<br />Solomon's Porch by Jane Riley is a book that takes the reader through the experience of being a prisoner in your own body and loving and caring for someone who is. Riley's masterpiece allows the reader to feel as if they are actually inside the daily lives of Ben and his wife Rose. After finishing Solomon's Porch, the reader will be exhausted, almost as they had just been on a major roller coaster at a theme park. The pain and suffering and trials and tribulations this remarkable couple go through are lightened by their obvious love for each other and commitment to see things through, no matter how dark the journey may become.<BR>Ben falls ill and test after test does not seem to bring the couple any closer to finding a reason for his pyhsical problems. He has very little control of his motor abilities from his shoulders down, almost as if he is paralyzed. And yet the couple keeps plugging along through procedure after procedure, hospital rooms, rehabilitation programs, and even surgeries.<BR>The key the reader will soon discover is Ben's attitude about life. &quot;I can make anything into a party,&quot; he says at one point in the story. And Rose's strength in caring for the love of her life is captured in the following, &quot;...she visualized herself in the eye of a hurricane. Others were whirling around her but she was composed, aloof, and in control.&quot;<BR>Riley writes with a style that literally brings the reader into the lives of these remarkable people and feels their minutes of joy here and there, and just plain entertains them with a story that could be riddled with self pity but instead triumphs in strenghths of mankind to persevere even when afflicted with Guillain-Barre' syndrome.<BR>Riley effectively flashes back in time during the story to the early years in the lives of both Ben and Rose to further develop the uniqueness of their character and unbreakable spirits. This extremely serious story has many humorous moments, which further demonstrates that Riley is truly a gifted writer.	2001-10-27
