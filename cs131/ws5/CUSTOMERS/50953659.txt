She tells the often repeated story of the Yankee swath of destruction though Georgia through three narrators: Sherman himself, a junior Yankee officer, and a Confederate widow who becomes a refugee. For those seeking a pleasurable read, I recommend it. For those seeking a study of the historic March, it can serve as a good primer to introduce readers to the topic. Then, a thorough study of non-fiction works can suffice.	2005-10-02

However, the problem lays not so much in the interviews with the authors but the way Boynton packages the information in his book. Almost all of the writers are asked the same questions and after several hundred pages, this wears thin. In all the book totals 430 pages. If he narrowed down the list of writers and added some diversity in his questions and presentation of their interviews, it would be a more enjoyable and even beneficial read.	2005-10-02

Learning Japanese through the Living Language series is helpful but also has some drawbacks. The biggest drawback is that the writers fail to include pronunciation helps in the text itself, however they do indeed provide native Japanese speakers to help in the accompanying three CDs. Also, they spend the first four or five lessons on various grammatical topics, which can actually be a little confusing when trying to learn a new language. Other language series jump into learning words and phrases by repetition, citing the fact that to really learn any new language you must practice repeating it over and over out loud and not worry at first about grammar and syntax. That being said, I will seek to finish the 40 lesson in this course and hope it better prepare me for my year that will be spend in Japan.	2005-10-02

Included is Lilley's career as a CIA agent in Asia as well as his years in diplomacy in Asia and notably China, culminating in his role as American ambassador to China during the first Bush adminstration. The only drawback I cite is his constant reference to his brother (who committed suicide just after World War II) throughout the book. Lilly's constant musing - often long - about what his brother might have thought in certain situations etc. gets tiring quickly and actually takes away from the narrative quality of the book.<br /><br />However, I recommend this book for an intriguing read and as a primer on Chinese studies.	2005-09-29

First, I note that she does, indeed, rely heavily on Scripture (I state this to nullify the Publisher's Weekly review and criticism about this). Moreover, this actually adds to the story's authenticity.  Rivers also sheds light on the Exodus events that few if any other writers have done before. Namely, she tells them through the eyes, not of Moses, but of his younger brother Aaron. In doing so she does a service to people who enjoy reading fiction and those who are serious students of Scripture.<br /><br />For those interested in applying the life lessons from Aaron, she includes a study guide in the back of the book.<br /><br />In all, it is an enjoyable read, and often an inspiring one also.

In this World War II tale we follow the American sub Archer-Fischer and her tentative skipper, Captain Joseph F. Enright, on her hunt and discovery of Japan's new secret weapon, a 72,000-ton aircraft carrier. What ensues is likened to a high stakes chess game scattered across the throes of the south Pacific.<br />The book alternates point of view every other chapter. One chapter is written in the first person by its author, Captain Enright. The other point of view is told using Japanese sources and follows the carrier's skipper, Japanese Captain Abe.<br />As the Archer-Fish tracks, then closes in and subsequently engages the huge carrier, the Shinano, you vicariously experience this all from the vantage point of your chair.<br />For example:<br />&quot;All of us could now hear the sharp sounds of the destroyer's propellers as she headed our way. When dropped to a keel depth of 62-feet, we would have about 10 feet between Archer-Fish's upper periscope support and the destroyer's keel. The Japanese war ship churned closer. The noise of its propellers increased in volume as she whipped through the water ... The destroyer rolling the water right above us. The beat of the big propellers so close was breathtaking. She thundered overhead like a locomotive. The whole submarine vibrated and rolled from the shock waves...\\"<br />Not only was the sinking of the carrier, the Shining, an epic event, but its telling her makes it an epic read. Highly recommended.	2003-09-08

Kennedy in WW II	Books	3	5	13	N	N	40th anniversary edition of Kennedy war tale --about average	The 40th anniversary edition of PT-109 is an enjoyable read despite its many flaws. The story is true and sheds light on a young John Kennedey and a small part of naval warfare in the Pacific during WWII. Yet, Donovan's writing is simplistic at times. It is somewhat obvious that when he wrote this book he did so under the gun, or in other words under a very tight deadline, something he admits in the beginning of the text. Another point of contention is his glossed over view of Kennedy. I guess when he was writing of the then sitting president it was hard to escape, but Donovan praised Kennedy at virtually every turn of the page. Something that frankly gets in the way. It would have been better to tell the story of Kennedy -- flaws included. What young man at war is --or is-- expected to be perfect? Nonetheless, PT-109 is a worthy read for WWII buffs. If you enjoy reading about the war in the Pacific, this will help carry you through the other obvious downfalls of the book.	2001-09-03

The book is informative and well documented, although it has -- even though the author admits it -- a pro-southern bias. The most enthralling part of the book is its coverage of the constant battling and skirmishing of the 5th Georgia and the Confederate cavalry with the hugh Union army under Gen. William T. Sherman as he cuts and burns his way through Georgia and the Carolinas. Though out numbered, the Rebel troopers are superior to their Union cavalry counterparts. Not until after Atlanta falls and the breadbasket of the Confederacy is spent does the Federal cavalry compare to the Confederate horsemen. By then, however, the Rebel army is ragged, hungry and ill equipped -- often out numbered three, four or five to one. It is amazing that they accomplished what they did. In all the book is an enjoyable read -- even for a Yankee! I also saw this book when I was traveling in Germany... seems in Europe some people enjoy studying American history...	2001-09-03

He does indeed breath life into historical figures long ago relegated to the dusty confines of old American History books. His plot takes the reader from the opening days of discord between the colonies and England to the high tide of the Revolution, the summer of 1776, and the signing of the Declaration of Independence. As well as rounding off his cast of characters -- George Washington, John Adams, Ben Franklin, British Gen. Thomas Gage, and others, Shaara's plot unfolds nicely. At times, I was reliving the opening days of the Revolution via Shaara's pen, but only for an instant. Despite Shaara's qualities, he gets bogged down in long winded renditions of the inner workings of the minds of his characters. In doing this, he at times breaks away from some climax or point of action. The result -- a feeling of being let down. He is most guilty of this when writing of the fighitng at Bunker Hill. Instead of bringing that scene to a close, he tappers off into the mind of his characters. If not for this, I would have rated the book with five stars. Notwithstanding, &quot;Rise to Rebellion,&quot; is still worth the investment of time and money.	2001-09-01

Unlike countless other writing books that promise the moon but but deliver the doldrums, Yudkin's advice is sound, practical and  relevant. The subtitle -Breaking In Without Selling Out- summarizes the  theme of her book. Her chapter on Informational Interviewing is timeless.  After numerous articles and interviews, some good, some bad, some  disastrous, I read her chapter on interviewing and found a kindred heart.  Many of her experiences and observations are the same as my own. One  example of this: &quot;You can often trace mistakes in articles based on  interviews to a reporter's failure to ask for clarifications.&quot; As true  a statement as ever made about the need for clarity in interviewing. In  chapter six - Constructing an Article - Yudkin resists the temptation of so  many writing teachers who o-v-e-r t-e-a-c-h, who don't allow room for  growth and a writer's own discoveries. She states, &quot;... the general  structure for magazine and most newspaper features run like this:  lead-backgroud-development-close. She discusses each aspect, but doesn't  overwhelm with opinion nor irrelevant information. Several other chapters:  Productive Work Habits, Building Momentum, and Succeeding As A Writer are  well written and provide timely advice. I have read countless books on  magazine and newspaper article writing, and none of them, including those  weighty volumes with 200-300 pages are more practical than Yudkin's Work.  For new, aspiring non fiction writers, I recommend putting it next to your  copy of The Elements of Style, your dictionary, and thesaurus.	1999-12-11

While I won't duplicate what I wrote before, I do offer the following: Driver's First and Second Maryland Cavalry, C.S.A. offers an indepth look  at Maryland and her divided loyalties during the American Civil War.  Brother against brother epitomizes the state of affairs in Maryland during  the war. Men, loyal to the South, crossed the Potomac river at great  personal peril to join Confederate ranks. Many did not make it,  subsequently they were imprisoned and often had their property confiscated.  Those who did make it acoss that infamous river shared the fortunes of  Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and the Army of Northern Virginia,  disputedly the finest army (Union or Confederate) during the war. Driver  spent years researhing sources in pursuit of this fine work and it shows.  His grasp of his subject matter as well as his grasp of the complexities of  war and of Marylanders is evident. In addition, he offers the muster rolls  of the men that served in the First and Second Maryland Cavalry -- this, in  itself, is worth the cost of the book. In these muster rolls lies the  pathos and drama of every conceivable fortune that awaited the average  soldier. Driver's book is recommended reading -- particulary for those who  love more indepth studies of Civil War units.	1999-11-30

This book is one of a kind! I first read it, worked its examples and exercises, and devoured it in 1994 when I decided to take my writing abmitions seriously.  This non-pretentious book honed my skills and solidified my style.<br />Five  years later my first book is being published and I am working regularly as  a free lance reporter and writer. The lessons learned form &quot;The Art of  Styling Sentences&quot; carried me through the birthing of my writing  career and are still with me. I just finished reading it for the second  time and when I feel my powers of writing persausion slipping, I get it out  and work some of the exercises. I keep it on my reference shelf next to my  my dictionary, thesaurus, and &quot;Chicago Manual of Style.&quot; For me  there is no substitute. Writers young and old, published and unpublished  buy a copy, read it, burn it into your brain and reap the rewards.	1999-08-22
