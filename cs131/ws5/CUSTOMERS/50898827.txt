I was excited first but was very disappointed for first 1-3 chapters, especially for the area covering various spread spectrum and modulation techniques for 802.11a and 802.11b, very poor work and very confusing.  I recommend that an excellent and easy-to-read book such as \\"Guide to Designing and Implementing Wireless LANs\\" by Ciampa (2001, From Course Technology, or to wait for \\"CWNA Guide to Wireless LANs\\" Second Edition by Ciampa) on one extreme side, to other extreme side of a highly technical or scholarly book such as \\"Wireless Communications: Principles and Practice\\" (2nd Edition) by Rapport (Prentice Hall).   <br /> <br />My second disappointment is the absence of 802.11g even considering its publication date and the flood of other vendor's 802.11g products in market (and for 802.16 Wi-Max, especially considering the price that I paid for this book and the reputation of CISCO). <br /> <br />I am somewhat happy with the rest of the book, done reasonably well, on the topics but hoped that it could be done much better.    <br />	2005-04-13

For professional and marketable working knowledge, use this book as a framework, along with many other good books such as (1) Incident Response (by Mandia & Prosise) and (2) Hacking Exposed (2nd ed, by Scambray, McClure, Kurtz) or (3) Maximum Security (3rd ed, Anonymous), or (4) Counter Hack by Stoudis, to supplement the reading and case study.	2002-01-29

This is one of the best book in IT Management (for upper level undergraduage or graduate level course).

Some of the chapters that I enjoy reading is Ch.3 (Strategic Information Systems), Ch.4 (Business Process Reengineering and Information Technology), Ch.6 (Electronic Commerce), and especially Ch.12 and Ch.13 (Planning for Information Technology and Systems, Information Technology Economics) for Managing IT.  My appraisal about this book is its well-balanced and insightful critiques (to rescue and enpower many of the simple and naive, or stubborn, from many of the crafty propaganda, illustions and deceptions of today's &quot;rise-and-die-quick&quot; empty promises and sales pictchs in this field).

Dr. Henry is &quot;the founder and father and the primary architect&quot; of Evangelicalism in 20th century, and the today's leading think tank among the 20th century intellectuals and scholarship since 1940's.  No doubt, He  is the living landmark of 20th century.  This volume is his masterpiece and  his life-time monument.  And I dare to say the landmark of the 20th century  in Christian philosophy and theory.  The volume 1 brings the best academic  and philosophical survey and discussion that 20th century could offer.  If  one can read through carefully, he/she will (1) survey the contemporary  philosophy and theology with &quot;the&quot; master, and (2) be able to  critique all in the first class scholarship and  in &quot;the&quot;  Evangelical perspective.  I guarantee that this volume enables its faithful  reader to be the world-class critical thinker in Christianity.  If you want  to challenge the top of &quot;the&quot; mountain of today's intellectual  and leading scholarship in Christian Philosophy and Worldview, I recommend  first of all without any hesitation, this volume!  (He is a humble and  godly man, and my dear teacher with Father's heart equipped with Grace and  Truth of God.

This is one of the best introductory book on Visual C++ (assuming that its reader should have a good understanding on C or C++).  I had a very hard time to figure out Visual C++ by myself, reading several introductory  books.  And even worse I did not getting the clear picture on the  difference between C++ and Visual C++.  (I believe that the key difference  and factor is in its Software Development Environment, for its  Code-Generating integrated tool &amp; environment, and its superb  Application Wizard). By the way I had over 20 years of various systems and  applications experience, along with my teaching experience at various  colleges.  And this book guides me like a toddler to learn how to walk, one  step at a time.  And I thank for its presentation which is very easy to  follow.<br />As noted by a few contra-reviews on this book, there are a few  places that even the compilation will be failed.  And it is very  frustrating to check line by line to figure out for type-error or what is  missing, or for who made a mistake.  For example (Chapter 16, pages  687-694), it will flag a fatal error for CDialog::OnInitDialog().  And one  should define a member function: virtual BOOL OnInitDialog(), in  CDlgDemoDlg class to refer CDiaglog::OnInitDialog().  <br />I am about a  halfway-through for last two months, reading this book line by line and  trying by trial-and-error, in my spare times.  But my effort is worthy and  I give so far A+ for this book and the insightful skill of the author,  Michael J. Young.  As I scan through the book for its content, I am very  impressed with its comprehensiveness on the major key topics, essential in  Visual C++.  I strongly recommend this book for those learning Visual C++,  first time.<br />Richard K. Min, Dallas, Texas, USA. November 23, 1999.	1999-11-24
