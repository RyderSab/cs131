That potential is so tremendously exciting that the reader's anticipation can carry an otherwise mediocre book a long ways based merely upon the appetite whetted by some intriguing ideas. Yet Sky represents what is worst about the speculative fiction field: a book that is all about ideas and nothing about literature and what that art form is to a people who read it. It cares nothing for what its ideas may mean, what we should do with those ideas as human beings, or how our art as a people is reflected upon the future. In plain language, like so many other novels, it is all about the cool-factor of the setting and nothing to do with follow-through on the high themes that setting may touch. Because of that lack in this book-and so many others-we find science fiction relegated to the critical \\"ghetto.\\" Stross has written a book for science fiction fans and a book that can only be enjoyed by science fiction fans; it will have no appeal whatsoever to a broader audience base. That will make it a forgettable book.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ: <br /> <br />There are a whole host of these sorts of space-opera stories and there is an audience for them (obviously, else who would be purchasing and who would publish?). For those readers, Sky will very likely be rather fulfilling. Fans of Star Trek in its many variations will find similar themes to ponder in these pages and this comfortable familiarity in a new setting will be delightful. Readers running the gamut of Alastair Reynolds, Peter F. Hamilton, Mark Budz, Richard K. Morgan, and any of a number of other (so-called \\"hard SF) authors will probably find this on their reading list and will not be disappointed.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />This would be a terrible book with which to introduce new readers to thegenre of science fiction-particularly those with a sophisticated literary taste. As we stated above, new readers to the genre will not be impressed with the setting and will try to peek behind the curtains at the ideas lying behind it... they will be as disappointed as Dorothy was when she first discovered the Wizard of Oz. For all the speculative fiction readers who, like us, are more impressed with philosophy than action, with characterization over setting, and lingering ideas than goosefleshed suspense, these people should seek other authors and other books to satisfy their longings. For those craving to learn something about themselves and humanity, there is nothing but disappointment.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-09-21

Based upon his prior publications of Ilium and Hyperion Cantos, there are many, many people eagerly awaiting this book. Ilium delivered in Olympos a heritage for a book/series of remarkable potential and it's hard to judge how its failure to offer any sort of conclusion or purpose to the overall story will affect its future popularity. We feel that for the classical elements involved (Shakespeare, Proust, and Homer  along with smatterings of Tennyson and other authors) these books could open up an avenue in speculative fiction that is largely unexplored and underutilized. Where Pressfield examines mythology in Last of the Amazons and the legends of King Arthur provide constant fodder for authors to chew on and spew forth endless reiterations and interpretations, classical mythology itself is an untapped market and we still relish the idea of authors searching out the limits of that potential. As Olympos enjoys brisk sales, it may inspire more authors to follow similar lines and affect the genre in that way but this book itself can not and will not be a definitive work in this budding sub-genre.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ:  <br /> <br />It's hard to predict how many readers will feel similarly disappointed about this book. Those readers entranced primarily with the anachronisms of classical figures may be more forgiving of the plot defects as they revel in the antics of Odysseus, Achilles, Helen, and that champion of all liberal arts majors: Hockenberry. Philosophers who love to debate about the effects of parallel universes and the material consequences of good and evil may ultimately be charmed by the arguments of Setebos and Prospero. Certainly there is plenty of blood, war, nudity, and sex to sate the appetites of almost any reader anywhere. Yet, at the end of the day (thank you business consultants everywhere), readers still want a story. Fiction is about the telling of the tale that can have a material effect on the lives of its readers. Olympos has degenerated into parlor room tricks and idle speculation. This is not the thing upon which to found a great book and we don't feel many readers will appreciate it. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />It will be difficult to keep adherents of Ilium away from reading a copy... but they probably should avoid. People concerned with the sex and violence of the prior book will find that quotient increased dramatically and also should avoid. There is no reason whatsoever to read this book without having first read Ilium. Nothing will make sense and the prior work is much better anyway. We believe the vast majority of readers who have read Ilium first will find Olympos tremendously disappointing for its lack of relevancy in story elements and failure to follow through on its own purposes. We have a lot of respect for what Simmons dared and attempted but we would be falsely praising it if we thought he achieved his ambitions.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-09-12

It is tremendously refreshing to read a series unabashedly trditionally heroic and romantic (in the chivalric sense)  yet has a storyline that goes in new directions. We have a protagonist in Fitz who fully matures as an adult and must deal with adult themes. We have a war where the economic and psychological damage is as compelling as the carnage. We have battles that take place remotely and in a guerilla fashion without the trope of mighty sieges and liberated cities. Hobb has certainly worked from a traditional genre and borrowed from former authors but it is also the case that her work has introduced themes of heroic sacrifice and political turmoil that have not been fully explored before. She has opened new ground for future authors and by our standard where we rate books by their effect on future authors (c.f., Harold Bloom's Anxiety of Influence) we feel her work can stand up under any criticism favorably. There is no question that future protagonists will have to stand up to Fitz as an example of the genre's most perfectly crafted hero.     WHO SHOULD READ    As in any highly regarded and very good series of books, readers of the prior books who have enjoyed Hobb so much will have bought and read Assassin's Quest before they've bothered to read any review of it. By these people, we believe that Quest will probably be regarded as the best of the three books. We also feel that this book could probably stand on its own and read in isolation. As with any third novel in a trilogy, loss of the background will result in many of the nuances of the work lost on the reader (certainly the romance between Molly and Fitz will be incomprehensible) yet it does not crucially depend upon the prior books. In a refreshing change, Hobb has written three books that work tremendously well in concert with each other but whose movements can also stand on its own. Readers who would like to explore this work need not necessarily read them in order. As a final credit to Hobb, this is an excellent book with which to introduce readers who are unfamiliar with the fantasy genre and do not believe there are any worthwhile publications within it; The Farseer Trilogy is a direct rebuttal. These books remain an excellent choice for younger (teenage) readers.     WHO SHOULD AVOID    Quest is the longest book in the offering and those readers who have been very impatient with Fitz's caviling about his responsibilities will be rather disappointed with the first third of the book (as we were to a certain extent). We don't think the book should be avoided but certainly there will be some people who will turn away. Fans of the huge, large-scale battles that have been rendered so well in Return of the King, A Clash of Kings, and The Gates of Fire will not find that sort of display here. The Farseer Trilogy has never been about these enormous wars and epochal battles. We think these people should expand their horizons a bit but also recognize that sometimes people crave the familiar and predictable. If that means big battle scenes, this book should probably be saved for later. If you get embarrassed about cheesy cover art (because of the cover of this book is C H E E Z - Z E E E ), you'll have to read it with a paper bag cover.   [...]	2005-09-05

They have learned to enjoy the hallmarks of her work and she executes these items very, very well. The immersive characters, the sense of justice, the romance of the work, these are all things that her readers have learned to expect and which she delivers (if not as grandly as in her Farseer books). But creating an audience does not a sufficient condition to influence a genre in the way we expect great books to do. Despite delighting her audience and constructing her plots well, we do not see anything in Liveships that will force future authors to grapple with her themes and elements in their own writing. Hobb's popularity will track evenly with her prolificity. When she ceases to write, we feel her books will be crowded off the shelves, new readers diminish quickly, and new audiences created for the next new series coming out that adequately serve such cravings. Her second and third books in this series will have to be far, far better in order to overcome the deficiencies of this first and launch The Liveship Traders in to true greatness.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ: <br /> <br />Fans of Hobb's other work will disagree vociferously with the more critical elements of our review. They will like this book with tremendous energy. It satisfies readers who crave their dramatic tragedies delivered in tactile rather than philosophical arenas and become very emotionally attached to the romantic elements of the characters. Aside from readers who enjoy other notable fantasy authors who deal in this arena, we think these books could cross over very easily from some of the less cheesy novels from the straight romance genre and perhaps the less gruesome horror novels dealing in vampires. Similarly, we feel that enthusiasts of cop dramas (Law and Order, CSI, etc.) could also find great satisfaction in Ship of Magic. If the sex is more heated and the language a bit coarser than Farseer we still feel this book is eminently suitable for adolescents and teenagers.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />Not to belabor the point, but this is not a book for people worn out with conventional fantasy and looking for something strikingly new or different. For this, they'd be better served with The Etched City, Perdido Street Station, or City of Saints and Madmen. Also, as we mentioned, romance is a major theme here and if the reader finds himself in the camp of just not interested in the love interests of the characters, there are large sections of this book he will find distasteful. Sophisticated readers who are coming from Farseer entranced by some of the chances and elements that Hobb took in the latter part of that series will probably be disappointed with this book (as we were). Finally, despite popular press to the otherwise, while good this book is no substitute for George RR Martin (A Song if Ice and Fire).  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-08-24

Freakonomics has been published to much fanfare. For the community of geeks, nerds, and lovers of statistics everywhere, it is the heroic march of one of their own (Levitt is replete with an awkward lisp to go with his classic ectomorphic body) come to fame, money, and credibility from the business and media elite. The beautiful people are buying the book of a geek and loving it! What triumph! Geeks everywhere know the immeasurable pain of laypersons in the media getting so terribly wrong ideas in which they themselves are well-versed but unable to explain. Freakonomics, more than anything else, is the celebration of the geek and how his work--his creative, counter-intuitive, oddball researches--can have a profound and profoundly positive effect on the society around him.  <br />That, by itself, should be enough of a reason for any smart guy who got shoved around on the school playground to want to run out and slap some money down.  <br /> <br />Freakonomics is the application of economic and mathematical statistical theory on large bodies of data mostly involving demographics within the US. The goal is to use this method to identify prime causes and motivations in people's behavior. The most famous (notorious) example of this is in the proof that the current reduction in crime is directly correlated to the legalization of abortion. Fewer unwanted babies equals fewer at-risk youth which ultimately equals fewer real criminals plaguing society. The data are compelling if intensely controversial. However, other items are explored as well: parenting being one of the most genuinely interesting components. Levitt's interests are as far-ranging as one can imagine: he looks at sumo wrestling with the equal attention he gives campaign spending. But over and over again the theme is the same: we know what peopel are saying about this stuff but what is the truth? Freakonomics is the analysis of numbers to arrive at an objective, incontrovertible truth.  <br /> <br />That is very cool.  <br /> <br />In a country where superficiality in media reporting couples with rambunctious opinion as more important than the news itself, it is a breath of fresh air to see academics seek answers in an objective, professional way and live by the results. If nothing more, Freakonomics is a lesson in how we, as a people, should be asking questions and assimilating data.  <br />What is even more exciting to the card-carrying geek is how interesting some of the more idle speculations can be. The application of mathematics and economics is introduced here in astonishing and resplendent variety enough to delight the peculiar interests of the most eccentric parties. This, too, is part of the triumph of Levitt and Freakonomics: the notion that is okay to ask questions as bizarre as: \\"Does the name I give my child have a hand in his fate for adulthood?\\" and attack that question in mathematically quantifiable terms is one of profound relief and joy to the geek (though surely to be spurned by those, like Fox Mulder, who \\"want to believe\\" instead of wanting to \\"know\\"). Business leaders as well can learn something from this book as they suddenly realize that they do not have operate by hunches, the bullet-pointed provisos by pundits, nor the collected wisdom of the ancient grey hairs sitting at their oaken tables. Deep analysis regarding crucial questions of human behavior is possible and is accessible. Any person who has been interested in and inspired by Michael Lewis's Moneyball will here find much of the same spirit and philosophy.  <br /> <br />The disappointments in this book lies in its lack of depth. The ideas are scintillating, relevant, interesting. Yet the book, at the end, reads more in the vein of a fine conversation heard in the private library at the end of a large dinner party of dignitaries. The book itself lacks a certain academic rigor and fails to take in to account the glorious potential it brings to the world. In a word, this very short book reads more like a gloss of a good idea than a final treatise on it. We can only hope that we have been given the Cliff Notes version for the larger public consumption and somewhere in the recesses of the publishing house lies the definitive work that will be eagerly consumed by all interested parties. Certainly the commercial success of this book should pave the way for more to come.  <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-08-03

Royal Assassin is an accomplished sequel to Apprentice that fans will attach themselves to it with great fervor. Yet as world-building fantasies go, aside from setting a tremendous example in how first-person story-telling should be executed we don't see a great impact on the genre as a whole at least as a result of this book. While Hobb's concepts of the Skill and the Wit are interesting, they are not substantially different from many other tropes in the genre. While the \\"forging\\" of prisoners is sickening in its way and emotionally charged, the theme of a completely amoral people and their effect on a civilization is not well-explored. The political structure of the Six Duchies is a bit sketchy in places and seems to lack internal causes and volition among its various factions and doesn't break new ground. In our assessment of works in how they will change the course of the genre and the effect on future writers, Royal Assassin has not convinced us it is groundbreaking in any way. As a book for entertainment, and passing time, and growing to understand characters that Hobb has created, it is exceptional and far superior example of many other fantasy novels that are not so skillfully executed. But the lan of works that garner our highest ratings require a creative force that Farseer, for the moment, lacks.    WHO SHOULD READ    The problems we had with this book were ones that can easily be overlooked by the great majority of buyers. That Fitz is a bit too noble, that his romance seems a bit too ideal, that the antagonists headed by Regal are a bit too caricatured, are all items of small interest to those craving a good, straightforward, exceedingly well-written saga. To these readers, Hobb will be a great satisfaction and a joy. As we mentioned, this is a book that can readily stand on its own and doesn't require any prior knowledge of the Six Duchies nor any especial knowledge of the fantasy genre in general. It is an excellent book for lighter vacation reading, for the precocious adolescent looking for something a little more substantial than Harry Potter, and certainly will deeply satisfy those readers who pine for romantic entanglements in their heroes.     WHO SHOULD AVOID:    For readers of more sophisticated taste or those weary of the fantasy genre and looking for something unusual or less predictable, Hobb will be faintly disappointing. Where Apprentice teased with a mention of more complex themes--of sibling rivalry in politically powerful families, of deeply held convictions and a fear of new things, of loyalty, allegiance, and how they clash when duty seems at odds with personal beliefs--Hobb dared to grasp at them in Royal Assassin and disappointed a bit in the follow-through. There is some tremendous material here but the book has lapsed back a bit in to more conventional storylines and more conventional themes. In many readers looking for something more than a story well-told it will bring some interest but no dedication.     (...)	2005-08-01
US	18598228	R1AVM2NOJGW5EG	0316172324	968642731	Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking	Books	2	6	7	N	N	Titillating... but lacks rigor and focus	Blink is a shifting, slippery, difficult book. This is rather a strange thing to say about the book as a general statement because it's written in very, very plain language, is aimed clearly at a mass (though literate) audience, and is a very brisk read in a very svelte book. Many readers will describe it as eminently \\"readable.\\"  <br /> <br />Yet, we have a problem. Blink lacks a kind of focus. Good, academic non-fiction will have a point, or a statement of purpose, or a principle to prove. It will have something to say. Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond is an excellent example of this. The Mind's Sky by Timothy Ferris is another.  <br /> <br />Blink really does not. It is a book that has a very interesting subject and has some very interesting things to say about that subject but lacks the academic courage to declare anything about the subject that might be ultimately useful to the reader or testable by a researcher (this despite many anecdotal stories regarding researchers delving in to this topic).  <br /> <br />The subject at hand is snap-judgments--or, as the book has it, \\"the power of thinking without thinking.\\" It is the instinctive sense that our conscious mind makes decisions based upon innumerable and subtle details our subconscious is picking up or, in some cases, where certain training and expertise makes the perceiver unusually sensitive to subtle details others might miss. These conscious decisions come to us instantaneously, overwhelmingly, and ineffably. The author describes this as \\"thin-slicing.\\" These details coalesce within the subconscious ways that enable the conscious mind to make a very quick, often very accurate decision. The opening section of the book lively describes the process with the story of an art museum acquiring a statue (kouros) and how they went about trying to verify its authenticity. It's an interesting topic that will grab the attention of everyone from the curious dilettante in psychology to the hard-nosed salesman inthe business world.  <br /> <br />But Blink then lapses in to a pattern that ultimately leads nowhere. It first  <br /> <br />Tells us how very, very accurate \\"thin-slicing\\" can be, then  <br />How experts can use thin-slicing to make even better, cooler decisions, then  <br />How awfully misleading thin-slicing can be--particularly in inexpert hands--along with a discussion of prejudice, then finally  <br />A summation of how people should find a balance between accurate and inaccurate thin-slicing.  <br />   <br />What is lacking in this book is any kind of scientific rigor. It is replete with stories--many of them amusing--and very interesting concepts. But there are no control groups, laboratory experiments, testable circumstances, or even corollaries speculating on the use or mis-use of thin-slicing. There is nothing ultimately useful about the book. The best that can be said about it, in the end, is that we now have a label and a term for what would customarily be regarded as first impressions.  <br /> <br />There is a worse and ancillary effect of this book as well. People who read it cover-to-cover will find it wanting due to a lack of rigor. To them, it will at best provide some interesting casual conversation topics. But for the business community--a group of readers notorious for reading bullet points instead of paragraphs, executive summaries instead of full reports, and opening chapters instead of entire books--they will take this book, read the first few sections learning how exciting and accurate thin-slicing can be. Then, they will begin to apply that knowledge to the business world far out of proportion for what is wise to do. You see, they will never make it to the more cautionary sections at the end. If Blink becomes a popular business book, it will wreak incalculable damage on the business community as it teaches the struggling middle-manager new terms by which poor decision-making based upon first impressions are made.  <br /> <br />That is a scary thing. <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-07-27

Inevitably, this pinpoints the rise and status of civilizations. By speculative fiction we can really include any speculative-minded person who indulges in historical fiction or even historical non-fiction in dramatic form where the mind is freed to imagine possibilities, realities, and the curious interplay of chance and fate.  <br />How exciting it is to read a non-fiction book that addresses exactly this idea of chance and fate as it relates to the most important of all terrestrial questions, viz.: why do civilizations rise and what determines their advance?  <br />Jared Diamond is a thoroughly engaging author--a crucial component when dealing with history--and in this Pulitzer prize-winning book, he manages to infect us with his interest in everything: geology, climate, group psychology, farming, animal husbandry... every facet of a civilization that can affect its rise is addressed.  <br />The original premise of the book was one with racial overtones: why did predominately white Europeans come to such an industrial advantage that they came to economically dominate the globe? Why is it that \\"red\\" American Indians, \\"black\\" Africans, or \\"yellow\\" Asians come to such a state as to be largely subdued by \\"white\\" Europe?  <br />The answer, as Diamond goes about proving, is everything but racial. And that answer--replete with all those interconnected facets of geology, geography and biology--is so much more tremendously exciting and instructive.  <br />It turns out that advanced civilization is much more fragile than the notional abundancy of Gaia-theory would have us believe. Domesticable, nutritious grains are not common. Domesticable animals are not common. Open lines of latitude as transmission points of information turn out to be extremely important where open lines of longitude are not terribly useful. That information--composed of technical knowledge, economictrade, and biological germs--become in turn very important in allowing the rise of cities and their ability to cope or cooperate with competition.  <br />Most intellectually curious people ponder the rise of civilization. To them, reading Guns is like seeing a great lot of puzzle pieces come together with audible clicks. The resulting portrait of civil evolution is compelling and rewarding by itself.  <br />As satisfying as this book is for the intellectually curious, there is a very peculiar appeal to those imaginatively curious people who imagine alternative lines of history or the future expansion of humanity in to space. Readers enthralled with alternative history will find out why evolution had to occur in certain cases and where it could have gone in different directions. Readers of fictional history will find their experience better informed and more deeply appreciated. Readers of world-building fantasy will find what a stunningly complex notion that is (and find themselves more appreciative of Tolkien). Finally, readers of space colonization and terra-forming will appreciate what a delicate proposition that is.  <br />Guns is a stunning scholarly achievement widely accessible by most readers of any kind. For our readers, especially, this is not to be missed.  <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-07-27

Where it still seems faintly adolescent to be caught reading even something as renowned as Lord of the Rings, Bishop is operating in a novel that is purely adult: purely R-rated stuff dealing in adult themes. This is, of course, something we rather welcome. Yet despite the storm of positive press, it is our opinion that this book will go un-remarked by future authors. Where Miville, VanderMeer and others are creating rules and tropes within a previously undiscovered territory, Bishop does not offer us anything to hang on to. This is considered her debut novel and it will be interesting to see how her writing evolves: her imagination is strong, her writing skilled, she now needs to create a subject and a place worthy of her devotion and talent. It is then that the coming authors will sit up, take notice, and their courses adjusted by her work. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ: <br /> <br />Amazingly enough, readers who liked Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or enjoy listening to some of the \\"trippier\\" stuff from The Doors will probably like this novel. Rather than being about horror or horror elements, it is a more a novel of the state of the mind, of dreaming, of hallucinating, and of reifying those metaphysical thoughts bouncing around in your skull. Those readers looking to blur the edges of ethics and government and instead like to explore the minds of people who do not restrict themselves by conventional standards of civilization will be intrigued by the characters and the dialogue they undertake.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD AVOID: <br /> <br />It is a mistake to consider this a horror novel... some horrible things happen but it is not the kind of supernatural horror to a civilization that Miville brings in Perdido Street Station nor the kind of sickening horror proffered by VanderMeer in Veniss Underground. Fans of these books might be interested in seeing what Bishop has to offer but they will be disappointed if they go looking for similar elements. Those readers (like us) looking for heroism will find it utterly lacking. There is nothing to cheer for, nothing to hope for, just unrelenting violence and depredation which is the flaw in this book. If these themes are important to you, you will be disappointed.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-07-12

This is beautiful, artistic writing. Yet our critical opinion is geared towards the agenda of how future works will be forced to deal with the innovations of prior authors. Hobb's work, because it so firmly grounded in the formula of fantasy fiction--a road so well-trodden its rut has carved out for itself whole shelves of imitation works on popular bookstore shelves--we think that there is little here that will be passed on to future authors. People will read these books, adore these books, and Hobb's writing will be held up in writer's workshops as some of the finest examples in the industry. Yet without that burst of creative energy to propel the ideas in her novel out of this rut we don't ultimately see it as having a profound effect.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />While adults can and should enjoy these novels, those most enthusiastic will be readers who enjoy coming-of-age novels and are either very well-versed in fantasy fiction of unused to fantasy fiction. Readers who have not been exposed to Raymond Feist, David Eddings, Terry Brooks and the countless others will find these books suffused with creativity and drama. Most particularly, readers who have read and enjoyed Leguin's Earthsea cycle and Lian Hearn's Tales of the Otori will find the emotional agon and more thoughtful perspectives of the protagonists very compelling. Those readers intimately familiar with these themes should read Hobb to discover how alive they can still become in the hands of a very skilled craftsman.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />This is heroic literature and deals with ideal themes. It is also, as a coming-of-age work, geared towards the egocentrism of youths. For those readers searching for works dealing with more amoral or ambiguous ethical characteristics in the works, then they would be better served by other authors. Readers who are customarily derisive of fantasy fiction in general may take a look at these books to perceive that very, very good authors exist and thrive in the genre but will probably ultimately be unimpressed with the material and should try something a little more cutting edge in which to apply their more snobby literary sensibilities.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-07-07

Particularly, fans of Alastair Reynolds, Peter F Hamilton, Dan Simmons, and other notable space opera, hard-science enthusiasts should embrace Wright who will quickly supersede these other authors.  He will do this precisely because he will take on literary themes that are ignored in favor of the action and the special effects that publishers believe the audience demands. Where Wright's influence will extend is in the notions of artificial intelligence, legalistic understandings of individuals in an age where consciousness can be transferred, manipulated, and quantified, and in the freedom to explore the Golden Age of times rather than dwelling in the aftermath of some collapse as is so often the case in science fiction. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ: <br /> <br />It is often said that Isaac Asimov's Foundation series is re-telling of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. In many ways, The Golden Age trilogy feels much like the golden age of classical Greece just before its absorption and transmogrification in to the Roman Empire. Only these people, with the transcendence at hand, are able to foresee their own long age of warfare. It's a beautiful moment and concept; it is what we would call a worthy triumph to a series that has been besotted with notions of immortality, super-intelligence, and cosmology. It is unthinkable that those who have started the series should not finish it.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />For those people who were not impressed with the philosophical speculations of the first novel The Golden Age and are reading ahead in reviews to see if there is any change let us be blunt: there is not. The debates do not slacken though neither does the action. However, the importance of the action takes a far second place to the outcome of the ethical dilemmas faced by these protagonist. Those readers who were hoping for serious warfare to break out (at least the kind with guns, bombs, and the like) between the Golden and Silent Oecumenes will be disappointed and should avoid this novel. It is the case, though, that Daphne provides a levity lacking in the first novel that was introduced in the second and comes to full flower here in the third. Yet in the end, when the last page is turned, this novel is somehow more like a classical symphony or a poem and those looking for something besides poetry and music should seek elsewhere.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-07-07

Lewis' Till We Have Faces has a bit of an image problem. She was very ugly as a youth and the ghastly response her face evokes from others causes her to wear a veil in front of them. Physical beauty is almost always an invaluable asset for a leader to possess. It helps enhance their image and how others perceive them. Lewis explores the effect of appearance as well as other different aspects of image in this remarkable book. <br /> <br />On the surface, this is a sophisticated retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth (my favorite one, actually) from the point of view of one of the jealous sisters. We get to learn much, much more about Psyche, her family and the culture into which she was born. We are presented with an in-depth exploration of a pagan, pre-Christian, barbarian tribe on the fringe of Western Civilization and how they come to be influenced by the blossoming and dominant Greek culture and philosophy. Lewis uses iconic characters to display the great, cultural shift from a barbaric, pagan worldview into the civilized Greek philosophy. So sophisticated is Lewis' narrative that you can also anticipate how the worldview will shift from Greek philosophy into Christian philosophy, which is itself a further refinement of Aristotle and Plato.  <br /> <br />The way the story is constructed, told in first person by a Queen reflecting on formative moments in her life, likely had an influence on one of our favorite authors, Gene Wolfe. The character of Orual and the way she tells her story seem to be a precursor to Severian (c.f., The Book of the New Sun) and perhaps even Silk (c.f., The Book of the Long Sun). Near the end of the book, a pagan priest finishes up the tale for her, just like Horn chronicled the Patera Cald. We also notice a broader picture of the events occurring around the characters, although they may not realize the importance of them at the time. Names also are translated into their literal Greek meanings such as the character Lysias who is always referred to as The Fox. We see this type of thing often in Wolfe. <br /> <br />All comparative analysis aside, the book's greatest achievement is demonstrating how image helps a leader motivate people and maintain order. Perception, rather than reality, can make or break a leader. Controlling how others perceive you is one of the main jobs of someone in a leadership role. Like the works of Machiavelli or Robert Greene, this book highlights the reasons why it is important for a ruler to appear a certain way and to always maintain control over emotions while in front of others. For example, a leader must never appear weak or foolish. The rabble wants a strong leader, not a buddy. When times get tough, and they always do, the rabble will turn to the leader. If the leader is weak, they will turn ON him. If he is strong, they will trust him, even if he is brutal as long as the brutality is does not push them into rebellion.  <br /> <br />We get to know two main political leaders, each displaying a different level of \\"image\\" control. First, we meet a Warrior King, who--although valorous on the battlefield--is cowardly, blustering and tyrannical. He is politically backward and does not tend to his image at all. As a result, he spends a great deal of time and energy stamping out insurrections and fighting pointless, pyrrhic skirmishes with neighboring kingdoms. After his much celebrated death, his daughter, Orual takes over. She is very focused on image, even taking the drastic step of hiding her ugly appearance behind a veil. Not only does this mask her foul looks, it actually creates an aura of mystique around her, enhancing her image. Below the superficial, though, Orual is brave, diplomatic, wise and merciful. Before you get too worried, dear reader, take heart. This isn't feminist \\"women good, men bad\\" stuff. It is highly unlikely that an Inkling would espouse such beliefs.  <br /> <br/>Underlying the image control of each leader is their unique leadership style. The King relies too heavily on his oppressive power and blustery personality to sustain his reign. He neglects nearly all other aspects of his kingdom and does not build a very good infrastructure to counter the bad times. The Queen, however, always tries to appear calm, majestic and wise. She never loses her composure in front of her subjects. She instinctively understands how this will undermine her credibility. As a result, her people trust her and she motivates them to new levels of achievement. She also has an eye on the future and invests time into her kingdom rewarding and recruiting talented artisans, craftsmen, builders and scholars. It is initially an expensive venture, but ultimately her investment pays off. Her backwater, barbaric kingdom flourishes and becomes a rich and mighty center of culture. Her \\"command and control\\" father ruled with an iron hand and would have never invested money on builders when he could conquer and enslave a smaller, neighboring kingdom. <br /> <br />A very good example of the contrasts between these two managerial approaches is shown by the attitude each ruler takes towards their kingdom's only valuable commodity, silver. The kingdom has several mines in operation during the king's reign. The king does not see the potential in the mines and primarily uses them for capital punishment. He sends his prisoners, enslaved enemies and political adversaries there to work hard labor until they die. As one would expect, output, production and profits are not pouring out of these mines. Orual, however, clearly sees the potential in the rich, silver deposits and completely overhauls the mining operation. She frees the slaves and prisoners and replaces them with skilled laborers. These laborers are allowed to keep any silver they mine over a certain quota. Since skilled, motivated, profit-sharing laborers are always more productive thanslaves, the mines are soon working to full capacity. The wealth pouring forth begets technological and cultural innovations which then lead to even higher levels of wealth and satisfaction. The kingdom is rich and the people are happy and fulfilled. Orual has done well. Her fair and democratic managerial style has reversed the nearly fatal autocratic style of her bumbling predecessor.  <br /> <br />Orual's focus on image and how she is perceived by her subjects plays a large role in the success of her administration. It allows her to inspire confidence in her people, challenge the status quo and turn around a failing enterprise. These lessons are as true today in our modern business world as there were in the pagan, uncivilized and barbaric world of Till We Have Faces. <br />	2005-06-18

Phoenix, as a part of that trilogy, will share in the glory. As a book by itself, it's effect will be much more limited as most middle books of a trilogy are. It will be remembered for Daphne, for Ironjoy, and for the fall of Phaethon--when all of his flaws are exposed and Empiritix Mundi  has brought him to his lowest point--but the height of Wright's achievement: the Golden Oecumene, the sophotechs, the colonization of space, the heroism of individuality in a chaotic universe--these are all themes that do not have their final utterance in Phoenix. For these themes, Phoenix plays a contributing part in the melody and must be considered only as part of the whole.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ: <br /> <br />We were tremendous advocates of the first novel, The Golden Age, and Phoenix does not disappoint as a follow-up. The tremendous hunger for more, more, more that Wright awakened will continue through this book and on to the next. It is a brisk, exciting, and quick read (it is quite a slender book in this publishing day and age when books of merit must be large, weighty tomes). In it, readers who enjoyed reading of the Golden Oecumene will find a wonderful harmonizing theme in the slums of terrestrial earth married to a fine heroine in Daphne.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD AVOID: <br /> <br />We must advise that no one begin this book without first reading The Golden Age. The events here are completely incomprehensible without that novel. The trilogy must be considered as a single work. Knowing that, anyone who suffered from the language, politics, and philosophizing from the prior book should not continue through with Phoenix. The book may disappoint a few with its brevity--we feel it could have been more successful had it been a bit longer and treated subjects a bit more languorously (the early events of Phaethon's struggles with the \\"afloats\\" is sometimes bewilderingly comical in its speed)--but any true irritation probably comes more from the fact that we are driven directly towards the third novel with little or no satisfaction in reading this novel by itself.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-06-14

It also exists in Ovid's Metamorphoses where we're given a golden age that lapses in to decline. Eden, also from the Bible falls in to this trope. We have Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which is self-explanatory. In other mythology, we're given Atlantis, which is a western myth of decline and ruin from a golden point of civilization. Neo-platonists and Romantic poets both yearned for the time of beauty and logic that was Ancient Greece.  <br /> <br />Even in modern times, we often look to prior eras with nostalgia: the ballroom dancing of the early 20th century to the Victorian courts of the 19th century. We decry these times as the worst of all possible times. We look with nostalgia on times of the unspoilt America where salmon were so numerous one could walk across the Columbia river, the Great Plains were filled with countless buffalo, and the Appalachains thick with old growth woods. Humanity carries it with a clinging guilt wrought from the exploitation of this earth in which we live that pervades our culture and our literature.  <br /> <br />Literature--particularly speculative fiction--is redolent with the decay and ruin of prior ages. Tolkien's cosmology is one, long, epic decline and fall. Unnumbered works of science-fiction take place in the ruin of a golden age beginning with Asimov's Foundation (itself based upon Gibbon) to more recent work such as Alastair Reynolds' \\"Glitter Band\\" turning in to the \\"Rust Belt\\" in Chasm City. The (endless) Wheel of Time (Jordan), the (equally endless) Shannarra series (Brooks), and the (finally ending) Sword of Truth (Goodkind) are just a few of the madly popular authors operating in speculative fiction today who take advantage of the archetype of decay and ruin.  <br /> <br />Certainly one need look no further than religious authorities of every stripe who constantly explain how this time is the most evil of all times and \\"the end is near.\\"  <br /> <br />This is why Jared Diamond's Collapse, which is unquestionably a work of science, takes on a strangely mythic tone. Why should these times be the worst of all times. Why should we constantly feel that things are getting worse? Why should we nod sympathetically to people who worry about bringing children in to \\"these times?\\" How is it, as the title implies, that we so often choose to collapse?  <br /> <br />Collapse gives reason and voice to many of these nameless fears. In a work that is as objective and non-judgmental as any thing we have ever read, Diamond explains in rational terms the decline and fall of civilizations. It's a work of immense scope, daring, and importance. This daring is something so vital and necessary to great authors that we feel this book--while the theme itself is important enough to draw many intellectually curious people--it will resonate strongly with the audiences more used to fictional genres. It is an excellent follow-up to his Pulitzer-prize winning Guns, Germs, and Steel, which chronicled the \\"why's\\" of civilizations rising. It is as relevant for any person concerned with the environment to any person concerned with the longevity and success of business and Capitalism--and we say this from the position of quite staunch Capitalists! <br /> <br />While not strictly environmental in tone, it takes on that mantle as it very carefully examines several different civilizations and their collapses. The environmentalism stems from the fact that the collapses were apparently so inextricably linked to environmental pressures. But this is no political rant. At each point, from ancient native American societies to modern days, Diamond examines the conflicting pressures on the people actually living there. Without apologizing for them, heexamines their follies as well as their reasons that give rise to the ruination of local environments. He equally celebrates some very large corporations who go to superb lengths to preserve the local environments and provide sustainable growth as well as some atrocities occurring at the hands of very small \\"mom-and-pop\\" fisheries and other ventures. This reasoned approach makes good cause for Diamond becoming the arbiter between the bitter feuds between Limbaugh's \\"environmental wackos\\" and Greenpeace's \\"evil, greedy corporations.\\"  <br /> <br />But it is the mythic notion that truly anchors this book and makes it so appealing to the intellectually curious. When we wonder why Arthur's court fell, or why Sodom and Gomorrah fell to wickedness, or why Enron executives defrauded investors, or why people wail about the rainforests, or why the people of Easter Island fell to the straits they now find themselves in... All of these questions are somehow given answer in the calm narrative of Diamond. As all good non-fiction does, it suddenly provides a solidity and reality to our more fanciful speculations. When he painstakingly describes the decline of Easter Island one is able to imagine the fall of Rome. When one learns about the political division that rip the state of Montana one can appreciate the perils of China and even an apocalypse of the earth.  <br /> <br />What Diamond gives so much better than almost any other book is a perspective: a vantage point by which a civilization can be seen and judged and to which one can measure one's self.  <br /> <br />And this is quite a gift.  <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-05-20

It seems every fantasy novelist attempts, at some point, a re-telling and definitive edition of the Arthurian myth. It is the only subject more trampled and copied than Tolkien. It is also the genre that lapses in to the most astonishing absurdities. Lawhead, with these three books (Taliesin, Merlin, and Arthur) has contributed something very relevant and very new to the genre.

But the book is so much more than that. It is the story of how neutrally inclined scientists can come together in a unified cause and take sides in a war. It is how the frisson of political pressure and pure research can result in a kind of synergy creating sweeping accomplishments undreamed of otherwise. It is the shining example of how a group of very, very smart scientists can come together, work together, and create a sub-culture of discovery. All of these things answer directly such platitudes of anti-war sentiment (it's not that easy even for genius minds of high ethical standards), ivory tower pure research rising above politics (it often doesn't even for genius minds of high ethical standards), and how a people can come to create such fearsome weapons (it happens even to people of genius with high ethical standards).  <br />Written with a pure, clean objectivity, Rhodes magnificently displays the progress, the hopes, and the doubts of these great men.  <br /> <br />Most importantly of all, it is a novel of war and all the staggering, numbing difference the mechanization of battle makes in creating awesome and detached destructive capabilities. Where the movie Saving Private Ryan dealt with battlefield horror it is the objective, analytical statements made by Rhodes as he discusses explosive yield and the effects of munitions on a municipalities that serve to make a pacifist out of Pittsburgh Steelers fan--all without a trace of judgment or opinion from Rhodes himself.  <br /> <br />The tome (it is long) begins at the very beginning when atomic theory was first being born to the famous ruminations and (ultimately) the presidential letter of Szilard and Einstein. It is how the Manhattan Project began, from its first experiments in Chicago with Fermi and the manufacture of uranium-235 to Los Alamos, Oppenheimer, and The Bomb itself. It discusses the parallel efforts of Germany and Japan. It discusses the paranoia of all parties over the progress and aims of other states. And it discusses frankly the destructive aims of all parties and the ways in which destruction was dealt. Quite curiously, it takes a detached view of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki themselves but deals with the effects of the atomic bombs quite explicitly. <br />  <br />So much is written about battle and war. Against that background, Rhodes' work operates in revealing the vast politics and work in the home nations as they struggle for resources, time, and armament in this great struggle. For all that people praise more famous works regarding WWII, it is this book that feels the most real for we learn so much about the people supporting the war as nations and patriots far, far behind the madness of the front lines.  <br /> <br />For the speculative fiction reader who is so often mesmerized by glorious accounts of epic struggles where the people are polarized between a (generally pacifist) group of politicos arguing for peace and appeasement on one side and a (generally led by the protagonist) group of well-intentioned military folk arguing for defense against an obviously all-encompassing evil, these people will--for the first--time gain an appreciation for the delicate nuances of staging a war. Rhodes' work is a glory in what it can teach us about war itself.  <br /> <br />For the discovery of the scientists and for an understanding of war--and even for the understanding of what makes an atomic bomb tick and how desperately hard it was to do--this is not a book to be missed.  <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-05-04

Something that has so thoroughly entered the lexicon and mindset of the people in the late 20th century and early 21st century can only be regarded as a great book. It has had an incalculable effect on the genre of science-fiction. Deep Thought and HAL (of 2001, A Space Odyssey) have completely created the idea of artificial intelligence and a writer can't begin to write a phrase uttered by a computer intelligence without dealing with that reality. If it teaches the genre anything, it teaches it the importance of humor. We have said that some writers are too ugly: M. John Harrison's Light suffers from this; China Mieville's Perdido Street Station and The Scar suffer from this; the classic Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever suffered from this; hundreds of overly-pretentious, read-it-it's-good-for-you-just-like-broccoli books published every year all suffer from this same fact. Laughter is very, very important to the human condition and it can't be ignored successfully. It is wrong to dismiss The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as a flight of fancy but ultimately unimportant; it is, in fact, tremendously instructive.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ: <br /> <br />Everybody should read this book. Everybody. There really is no audience that it can't appeal to. Children as young as 12 or 13 can enjoy as equally as codgers in their 70's. The institutions that Adams was bashing so many years ago are just as relevant today. It's a slender book, a fast read, and widely respected and, as such, comes with a pedigree. We're not sure if the movie will be anywhere near as good as the books (though we have hopes given the success of the radio series) but to the extent that it inspires more sales of this book, so much the better for our world.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />There is a certain group of people--a people suffering from a strange psychiatric illness--that have no sense of humor. These are the people most often associated with enforcing political correctness. They are the people claiming offense and injury at all audible and epistolary provocation. They are the people who think children shouldn't run or laugh but sit still and silent until spoken to. They are the tragic wastrels of a life fiercely lived with a clutching, grasping notion of universal justice, imposing order (most often religious), and political retribution. They are the people who leave shopping carts abandoned in the parking lots because \\"those people\\" are paid to put them away. Douglas Adams will be entirely lost on these individuals. They should return to reading whatever hate-inspired literature that teaches them to abhor who they are, where they live, and that people exist at all.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-05-03

While selling well initially, we don't believe it will (or should) survive subsequent printings. Concepts of digitized consciousness, space expansion, and virtual reality are all done better by John C. Wright and other authors. In short, the book is just too horribly long and tangential to achieve any kind of necessary coherence such to inspire a large and enduring fan base. Space operas should be grandiose, magnificent affairs that offer larger-than-life scenarios. Hamilton gives us pedestrian characters, overly familiar plot points, and nothing which offers to add anything new to the genre itself.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOUD READ THIS: <br /> <br />There is a kind of avid reader of speculative fiction who enjoys a certain way of telling stories. He likes to get familiar with his settings, introduced to the characters, and then follow their lives and try to puzzle out where everything is going. These books are interesting to these people in the same ways that people read Dear Abby letters and other features within newspapers and magazines. These are the people who read Otherland by Tad Williams with delight and are still reading The Wheel of Time books. They are probably the same people who read Star Trek novelizations, Star Wars novelizations, Dragonlance novelizations, and wish that Star Trek TNG had gone on creating new episodes forever and ever and ever. These people like to work puzzles. These people will probably like Hamilton's work here in Pandora's Star and his follow up in Judas Unleashed. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />People picking up books in speculative fiction are either looking for Literature with the Capital-L or escapist novels that are exciting thrill rides. This book fails on both sides. Too lacking in ambition to qualify as Literature these people should look to Tolkien or Chiang, Wolfe or Crowley. Those people looking for a thrillride will find themselves grinding their teeth at every indecent plot shift and continually be \\"fast-forwarding\\" through many different chapters as they search vainly through the many plot threads looking for the ones that interest them. It is an exercise in diminishing returns. These people should look to Orson Scott Card, George RR Martin, Greg Bear, or Neal Stephenson's earlier work.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-05-01

This book, The Coming of Age in the Milky Way, is the book that earned him his famous name.  <br /> <br />The problem with so many non-fiction books dealing in the so-called \\"hard sciences\\" is that the fields change so rapidly that the works very quickly become obsolete. One need look no further than Cosmos by Carl Sagan and even A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking to realize how quickly cutting edge theory becomes yesterday's news. This book is different. Coming of Age is a classic that will withstand the obsolescence of many other books because, rather than promulgating unified theories and multi-universe dimensions, it instead takes an historical approach. It is quite literally the human race coming of age in the field of astronomy beginning with the ancient peoples and the first notions of a round earth, through the classic Greek and Arabian astronomers, through the dark ages to Galileo, Copernicus, and Newton; following through with Einstein and finally the quantum-state theories we have today.  <br /> <br />Rather than a boring litany of discoveries that one might find in an encyclopedia, Ferris makes his book a rousing discussion of scientists flailing at the unknown and chronicling in detail all the misunderstandings and missteps taken in the drunken, ambling path of cosmic discovery. It's that fallibility in understanding matched with the insatiable curiosity of the human race that makes the work so enlivening and so breathtaking. It becomes impossible not to become entranced with this brotherhood spanning so many ages seeking no more than a deeper understanding of the stars. For many, it will become an historical study in how people think and even why people reach to discover.  <br /> <br />For anyone who has never heard of Timothy Ferris, this is a terrific book in which to begin.  <br /> <br />More importantly, for the science-fiction fan who becomes impatient with non-fiction material, Coming of Age reads as quickly and as exciting as any well-written novel in the speculative fiction field. Even better, it provides a solid basis of understanding in physics, astronomy, cosmology, and even some philosophy by the end of the book. Because it's historical, it treats much more the mentality of discovery and tracing the paths of the human race than trying to commit to future theories and, as such, should earn a place in the historical annals many decades from today just as Herodotus and Thucydides are still read today as studies in classical history. It is the one non-fiction book that any strong adherent of science-fiction must read in order to bring new life to their own curiosity and imagination while grounding them firmly in reality. <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-04-29

Boston was the home of Harvard, Emerson, Longfellow and other giants that helped to forge the uniquely American intellectual movements of transcendentalism, Unitarianism and Yankee pragmatism. These elites, however, sailed their gossamer vessels on the sea of the unwashed masses.  Their supposed Athens, as recounted by Pearl, was a faade masking a culture that institutionally excluded Irish and Italian immigrants, approved of unabashedly racist cops, and took aggressive measures to limit or even eliminate what they felt to be the corrupting influence of the Catholic Church.  He masterfully weaves his tapestry while avoiding sermons or the grinding of axes.  Like a disciplined historian, he paints an objective portrait of Boston without judging it by 21st Century standards and values.  His use of racist slang and attitudes clearly is designed to recreate the mores of the time rather than offend the reader or spark debate and controversy.... <br /> <br />This is a great book, but not one inclined to lead to multiple readings.  It is a single bottle of the above-mentioned champagne.  As pleasurable as such a bottle may be, however, once it is corked and consumed it is gone forever and likely the euphoria it offered not repeated.  Such is the case with Pearl's book.  As much as I loved reading it and savored the exhilaration it offered, once the climax was reached and the plot concluded, I was left with merely an empty bottle and some very fine memories.  A good book might be like a fine bottle of champagne, but a great work of literature is like an entire vineyard, yielding an abundant harvest after each labor.  It is a blossoming gift that yields a lifetime of pleasures.  A mystery novel, even one as carefully and lovingly constructed as this, cannot yield ever-increasing returns.  Once the mystery, motive and murderer are revealed the interest naturally wanes.  The champagne bubbles are released into the air and vanish.  The best one can do is pour a glass and lament that such a delight cannot last forever. <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-04-18

Stephenson's The Diamond Age, Alastair Reynold's Revelation Space, and M. John Harrison's Light are three notable examples of authors attempting to wrestle with the results of future technologies. It is very interesting that both Stephenson and Wright chose Victorian ideals as their principle settings for a future people attempting to deal with their technological wonders. (Let us not forget less notable examples such as Clade by Budz and Altered Carbon by Morgan.) Wright is attempting to eclipse these excellent efforts and he may yet do it. In order to do so, he will have to create his world as a compelling force that sears itself in to the minds of his readers in ways that make it inevitable in our minds that things could turn out any other way. He may succeed! He hasn't yet with this first novel but he may succeed by the end. If he can, Wright could very literally change the genre itself.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Those readers who are compelled by future world-building of the higher order--that is, fans of those aforementioned authors Stephenson, Reynolds, and Harrison will find themselves eagerly devouring The Golden Age. Additionally, politically minded fans of Ayn Rand, Robert Heinlein, Michael Flynn, and perhaps even authors from the other side of the political spectrum such as Kim Stanley Robinson will find a lot of very interesting moments in this book where such problems as freedom versus the collective and aesthetics versus judgments are treated fairly and completely. Certainly those stubborn adherence of Terry Goodkind--a man who can seem to only echo endlessly and shallowly the arguments of Ayn Rand's objectivism--should come to Wright's work and see the subject treated with depth, vigor, and the breaking of new ground.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />We can't make any recommendations here. It is one of the best works of science fiction available on the market. The only market to whom there may not be an appeal are to those people who are wholly uninitiated in science fiction to begin with. Some authors, like the aforementioned Robinson, can draw events of colonizing the stars in near-future terms that are capable of appealing to broad audiences. But because of Wright's completely unflinching manner in approaching his worlds, people unused to dealing with artificial intelligence, consciousnesses existing independently of bodies and stored in mechanisms, and an easy acceptance of changing the world and worlds to fit the needs of a striving humanity, may quickly become lost and drown in the onslaught of new ideas. In short, a certain amount of training may be required to fully appreciate Wright and meet him on the terms that he sets for his readers. This problem--if it is a problem--may ultimately restrict The Golden Age from finding the kind of large-scale audience it might otherwise deserve. <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-03-30

Books	5	4	15	N	N	Good Business Reading	We're in the \\"information age,\\" right? We have more knowledge readily obtainable and freely exchanged now more so than any other point in the history of mankind-by far. The hottest arguments of the day are not so much about conflicts over resources, or class structures, or religion, or other traditionally newsworthy items but more often than not are about specifically how information is going to be classified and delivered. In political elections, the press is as likely to report about reports of their own bias as it is about the candidates and their platforms. Various permutations of the arguments over political correctness dominate discourse at all levels of the society from business, to politics, to PTA meetings. Fortunes are routinely made and lost not in business ventures but just plain information about business.  <br /> <br />This makes a book about the press and its dysfunctions so relevant to business leaders. Learning how the press creates and reports its information through its various apparatuses is strikingly similar to companies and their own dissemination of information between its various departments and executives. Stossel is a very convincing, a very earnest, and a very amusing writer. He writes with a sincerity of purpose that is beguiling: his motives are pure, he clearly wants to believe that the rest of the world operates from a similar set of motives and principles, and is surprised and disappointed-again and again and again-each time he uncovers some new scandal.  <br /> <br />Is that not the business world? A mass of people motivated on the surface to work in the service of a company with a single profit-oriented goal in mind but beset with all the flaws, problems, and Murphy's Law Incidents that stem from the chaos of thousands of competing individual interests.  <br /> <br />And here is where the business leader can learn so much from Stossel. He identifies, through a chronicle of incidents, the problems of mob opinion, the evils of lazy research masquerading as detailed analysis, and the vigor that is Capitalism in its constant and eternal struggle against collectivism and bureaucracy. There are countless stories here that resonate directly in to the Office Politik not to mention serving as a primer in the dangers of dealing with the media on behalf of your business.  <br /> <br />Read this book if you don't understand the antagonism the educational elite and the media seem to hold to business and Capitalism. Read this book to understand how information becomes transmuted and subverted. Read this book because it teaches you about the lifeblood of your business-information and how it flows. <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-03-28

Still, for all the charm and skill in this book-and they are considerable-the work is still not strictly memorable in the sense of a story getting under the reader's skin and affecting the way he sees his life around him. The book has not changed the way time travel is considered in speculative fiction-in fact, one could argue that this theme is actively ignored. Gates is, in the end, an action novel with the trappings of a time-travel setting. In all honesty, time-travel isn't even a requirement of this plot: the book could just have easily been set in the contemporary era, entered the genre of horror, invoked the same dark magic with the same popularized villains We say this because Powers doesn't make us think any differently about London, about the Romantic era of English literature, or even Egyptian magicians. For as much as we liked the book-looking at it from the perspective of a critic we can't say it has changed anything about the genre.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />There are many occasions where people simply want a skillfully told and engaging tale to read: a vacation book. If this is what you're looking for and you have a bent for Romantic poetry, Egyptian mythology, or a spot of time travel, then it would be hard to do better than pack up this book in your carry-on suitcase for relief from the squalling urchins that infest the backs of passenger airplanes. While not as good, people who enjoyed Ilium by Dan Simmons, The Lecturer's Tale by James Hynes, and even portions of City of Saints and Madmen by Jeff VanderMeer, may find some of their interests in seeing academicians portrayed in heroic situations satisfied. There will be a substantial number of people who will disagree with our review based upon their love of his prose,his characters, and the ease with which the book speaks to them-and in fact, we agree!-but we also maintain that it will not be one of the more ultimately fulfilling books of their lives.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />One of the closes parallels to this book is Ilium. If the notion of reading the ancient past revisted upon a modern (or future) situation is compelling to you, then go to Simmons first who commits entirely to the genre, his theme, and the importance of literature. To find your intellectualism explored to the utmost, then Gene Wolfe's Latro in the Mist and The Book of the Short Sun are far, far superior. This is a good book, not a great book. To enjoy it, you must have a strong commitment to speculative fiction and not expect to find a great work of literature that can go toe-to-toe with the works of any author in any genre.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-03-21

Clade will take its place in the canon not so much alongside cyberpunk novels in the mold of Gibson, Stephenson, and Dick but rather with the countless offerings warning of looming catastrophe from climate change and genetic engineering. It also makes pretensions towards the problems of a police state armed with too much power over the (lack of) privacy in its citizenry.  But even for this very forgiving audience it is a highly forgettable book. It is a good idea that got stood up at the altar by the plot. It is a short book that is over before it really found anything to talk about. It may live with some readers for the cool idea (and name) of \\"clades\\" as private, autonomous, and closed cultures but really there's nothing here that hasn't already been explored. The canon will completely absorb this book and--aside from pushing notions of what can be done with biological rather than mechanical agents--will do nothing to influence the genre.<br /><br />WHO SHOULD READ<br /><br />The hardcore Greenpeace adherent might find some merit in this book and it really appeals to any reader absorbed in the politics of anti-capitalism and climate change. However, those readers would be far, far better served by Kim Stanley Robinson's Forty Signs of Rain. For readers interested in how future technology might change society, there might be some interest here as well but, again, they would do better to read the works of Neal Stephenson in Snow Crash and The Diamond Age. We really don't see much else in this book and we're honestly puzzled where the positive press is coming from.<br /><br />WHO SHOULD PASS<br /><br />Every point of plot has been done already and done better as we mentioned above. The coolness of the novel is in the idea of \\"pherions\\" and \\"clades\\" both of which can be summed up in a 2-page synopsis of the plot without the bother of buying and reading. After that, the best recommendation that the book has is that it's over quickly and that's hardly enough reason for anyone to buy. Here's hoping that those of you who invested in Crache found something better than we found here.<br /><br />[...]hat those of you who invested in Crache found something better than we found here.

This has given him a spirited and fiercely loyal audience but has also hurt his overall appeal. Latro is no exception in this regard. People who call it meandering are right. The plot goes any direction but straight ahead. People call it confusing and they are right. Yet this is the reason we read Wolfe: because finding out about the plot is exactly part of the fun and understanding why the confusion exists is all the importance in the reading. Latro will earn a treasured place in a Wolfe's corpus and we believe it will remain Wolfe's most accessible work that maintains the maximum rewards that reading his novels brings. There is a rumored third installment in the \\"soldier series\\" on the horizon and it will be interesting to see if it can match the vlaue of these first novels. In light of the recent cinematic productions of Troy and Alexander along with the popularity of The Gates of Fire and Mary Renault (not to mention the undimmed popularity of Herodotus) we thing there is a huge audience craving for fiction from this era. It could even be said that Latro has opened up this genre for a whole series of authors in this regard.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />We can recommend Latro for two audiences: those who've read Wolfe but haven't yet gotten around to Latro and those who are intrigued with the idea of reading Wolfe but don't want to commit to the twelve novels that comprise the solar cycle. Those effete snobs who think that speculative fiction doesn't have any writers operating within it that can match the anointed ones pulling down mainstream awards should definitely read this book: it'll put a stop to those snotty little arguments. There can be no doubt that Wolfe is operating on a level that very, very few authors can match and of those that can, most of them are dead and reside in anthologies of literature to bestudied by earnest students in universities.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />However, Wolfe's skill is exactly on of the reasons that people should consider passing on these books. Reading his books is hard. Whenever we're done, we need to take a break and read pulp novels for a while. It takes a lot of time and energy and generally a few false starts. Whenever there's a big gap in new material on Inchoatus you can make a good bet that we're tackling something else that Wolfe wrote. Our point is, we're not being elitist about this: reading great literature is usually very, very hard and demanding--just like polishing the guns down at the gym on a regular basis is hard. You've got to know what you're getting in to: a lot of unfamiliar words, no help from the author regarding plot, and a cast of characters that will often do some astonishingly bewildering things. But the rewards are great. Don't tell us some guy named Jordan or Goodkind or Brooks is the best author around until you've tackled this stuff and given it a try.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-02-24

It's sold a lot of books, has enjoyed multiple printings, and has to be regarded as a successful novel. However, according to our criteria where the greatest books change the genre and the way we look at literature, it fails. The idea and the unflinching honesty in its execution are so good that it is enough to inspire audiences but it will inspire them in ways that will not reflect the tenets of the book, its author, or its characters. Numberless fans will disagree with us but we ask them: can you honestly tell us that this is one of the top ten or so books you would have your kids read? We don't think that it rates that highly. There are other books that are deeper, richer, and more rewarding. In the end, it is a terrific alien invasion book told in a compelling (if irritating as far as an editing plan goes) manner--but that's all. And we can say that about a lot of books.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Alien invasion has a lot of currency. Most especially there are a great many books being published that are being powered by our current puzzling lack of evidence as far as extraterrestrial life goes in genuine scientific inquiry (\\"Where are they?\\" as the question goes). It's refreshing to see a book that's good enough with its science to be aware of this problem (Fermi's Paradox, etc.) and deals with it in ways that are important and integral to the novel. For people who enjoy cerebral exercises of this sort in alien invasion, they will be keenly satisfied with The Forge of God. Readers who enjoyed the premise of Alastair Reynolds Inhibitor Series (beginning with Revelation Space) then Forge will read with much the same vigor and rewards equally if  much closer to home in time and space. For people who like reading about Earth dealing with aliens but are tired with the excesses of movies like Independence Day, V, Sphere, and The Puppet Masters (movie not book!) then you will find this book refreshing in the extreme. Certainly people who have long enjoyed Greg Bear and his books have little use for a review like this and have already read and enjoyed his work. If you're discovering Greg Bear and liked Darwin's Radio and Darwin's Children (how could you on the latter?) quite a bit then you should reach back and try this one out.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />No literary mastery here, as we would understand it. That is to say, people who enjoy reading about people specifically will not get along with The Forge very well. They will, as we were, be annoyed by the short chapters and featureless characters. People who read Gene Wolfe, Jeff VanderMeer, and Ted Chiang, for example, should probably stay far away from a book like this. Another group that will be disappointed by this book will be those people who read for the action itself. These are the people who liked all the gunfire in Independence Day and didn't particularly care that not a lot of it made scientific sense. The irony of Greg Bear is that he fails both sides of this extreme but, then again, he probably doesn't care. His imagination is so forceful that it probably doesn't deign to notice such trivial criticisms as these.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-02-01
US	18598228	R3CXPIUJ9TQP20	0380978938	591476242	Ilium	Books	4	5	11	N	N	Invites comparisons with Neal Stephenson--Terrific!	Simmons is quite a famous author with a devoted following. He has ranged around the genre investigating all kinds of forms and, actually, writing exactly what he pleases. It's very refreshing to see a talented author write in the genre by choice and interest when he clearly could sell well writing anything for anybody. One of the effects Ilium will have on the genre is in inspiring readers to actually read The Iliad, Shakespeare's sonnets, and perhaps even tackle Proust (not to mention the odd poem by Tennyson). Much of the book reads like discussions of academics over beers at the local college bar and it is really that kind of interaction that provokes a deeper understanding of literature and keeps the Greats in front of people and their books read. In many ways, it shares the same agenda as Inchoatus. Eventually, though, we feel that Ilium will be something that the genre will absorb rather than it changing the genre. But all bets are currently off pending the publication of the sequel.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />People who read and adored the Hyperion Cantos will probably have already read this book before they read this review. This is exactly the kind of book they love. Similarly, there is a large number of students of literature both at the college and post-graduate level who nurse a secret, guilty pleasure in reading speculative fiction. Ilium is rife with jesting and satire regarding academics not to mention the whole Homeric classical world. For them, Simmons provides the best possible sort of book for these elite to take a break from James Joyce, Harold Bloom, and Jacque Derrida. For readers who enjoyed the humor of Neal Stephenson in Cryptonomicon and Jeff VanderMeer in City of Saints and Madmen, they will be delighted with the originality and scope of Simmons.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD AVOID: <br /> <br />It's hard to imagine someone not enjoying this book. Rather, it is the level of enjoyment that different individuals will find intheir reading. To properly enjoy Ilium in all of its facets, one is required to have a good understanding of Homer, canonical literature in general, and the behaviors of academics. One also has to be sincerely interested in mythology as it relates to literary theory and interested in the importance of literature itself. That being said, there is still plenty of humor, action, sex, and intrigue to satisfy what we will perniciously refer to as \\"groundlings.\\" In a wonderful sense, Simmons is echoing Shakespeare's plays in that he plays to the intellectual intelligentsia as well as the bleating fanboy (groundling) who wants cool space weapons and pretty, naked girls. He serves both capacities almost equally well. In fact, part of the distraction of the work that may hinder some from finding final enjoyment in this book are those readers who want a bit more commitment to escapism or high-brow literature out of their author rather than him straddling the line. However, we submit that these people should probably get out of the house more and maybe exchange a few words of live conversation with other people, say, once a month or so in order to understand that life itself doesn't really commit like that.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-01-20

We are more convinced than ever that Morgan's place as a writer will be determined far more by the success of the movies made from his books than the books themselves. Morgan really doesn't have a lot further to go before becoming just as formulaic as James Bond or Conan the Barbarian novels. For the character he has created in the universe he has formatted, that's about all the success he can hope for. While that success is commercially significant (in the extreme!) it hardly literarily significant in the same way that Tolkien or Wolfe or Bradbury are significant. We don't believe that Morgan has broken any new ground nor is there any on the horizon with expected future volumes. His books--absent a cinematic revival--will be the equivalent of pop music's one-hit wonders.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ: <br /> <br />There is a considerable audience that will enjoy Broken Angels--mostly all the people who really enjoyed Altered Carbon. Idolaters of the Byronic Hero (that is, the mysterious and dangerous man with a dark past; silent, brooding and introverted to the point of pathology; and battling somewhat hopelessly against dark forces that will some way assuage his implied guilt) will embrace Takeshi Kovacs with all the fervor that they embrace Clint Eastwood in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, Harrison Ford in Blade Runner, and Vin Diesel in Pitch Black. We use these movie references rather than literary ones on purpose--you have to like a good movie more than a good book to thoroughly enjoy this novel and there are plenty of \\"readers\\" out there fitting this description. As before, you also have to really love buckets-of-blood violence and kinky, explicit sex as well. All in all, not a bad weekend read but not something you put on the same bookshelf as your tattered and beloved edition of The Lord of the Rings.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />There's a disturbing but pervasive penchant to classify readers who enjoyed Snow Crash, Light, and other decent cyberpunk or New Wave novels in to groups of readers who would enjoy Broken Angels. This is not the case. These other, superior novels have a depth, richness, and literariness that is completely lacking in Broken Angels. Better comparisons are made with Neuromancer, King Rat, and Michael Crichton novels; perhaps as well to the host of Terry Goodkind novels if you can stand the comparison to works of fantasy.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2005-01-13

At Inchoatus we have a very definite focus and agenda: we think that speculative fiction--when it's at its very best--is mythic, important, and touches on age-old archetypes. Mystery novels just aren't built to do that. They're insular, self-contained, self-centered affairs that live and breathe on what happened to a very, very small group of people. For example, it's very difficult to compare Altered Carbon to something like Red Mars. In Red Mars, the incidental death of some rich corporate guy wouldn't even register as a blip on something as dramatic and all-consuming as planet terraforming and revolution. But Morgan asks us to read an entire novel about it.     But it's not just that: even mystery novels can have something more to say for themselves. The movie Blade Runner was built as a mystery thriller but had very important things to say about awakening intelligence in androids and the meaning of the word \\"soul.\\" Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson is also somewhat of a mystery novel but also touches on very important themes of how people live and breathe in virtual environments and what information and language actually mean to those societies. Our take is that Altered Carbon is missing these things that flesh out the better works of Blade Runner and Snow Crash. Morgan--in this book, at least--just doesn't run that deep.     WHO SHOULD READ THIS    If you love detective novels in any sense--be it set in the past, present, or far-flung future--then you'll really like this book. If you enjoy your mystery novels with heavy doses of violence and sex, then you will love this novel. Fans of Philip K. Dick will especially find resonance in this book as will, to a lesser degree, fans of Neal Stephenson's earlier cyberpunk work and William Gibon's Neuromancer. Altered Carbon is darn near the twin sibling of Reynold's Chasm City so if that book did it for you so will this one. Not particularly striking since you can glean all ofthis from the snippets quoted on the book jacket but in this (rare) case the book jacket gets it right. While we submit that there is a lack of depth in a literary sense in this book it is the case that the concept of \\"sleeving\\" is interesting and people deeply invested in concepts of soul versus body will find quite a lot of satisfaction in the subtext. Beyond all of this, it is also very brisk completely self-contained, and reads quickly, which is a welcome respite from a great lot of tomes and chronicles we've had to deal with lately from the publication houses.      WHO SHOULD AVOID    If you hate mystery novels, most definitely pass. You absolutely must have an emotional stake in \\"whodunit\\" in order to enjoy this novel. That is an absolute requirement. If \\"whodunit\\" is a niggling detail to you and you'd rather explore some of the more philosophical concepts of living in the 25th century, you'd better check out a different author. Also, in a sense, this novel reads very much like it was intended from day one to be seen on the screen. We feel that it may be a far superior movie than a book. Yet reading things that seem more visual than imaginative can be irritating to a class of reader more in tune with, say, Ray Bradbury. If you're in that camp, this is another novel for you to avoid.     [...]	2005-01-05
US	18598228	R36R3BSAJXDD2D	1582344167	481973042	Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell	Books	5	6	10	N	N	Brilliantly different from almost anything in the genre	Not knowing Clarke's background it's hard to assume the authority to say this but at least from a reader's perspective she has entered the genre entirely unfettered by any preconceived notions of what fantasy novels should look like. Perhaps her fresh perspective is exactly what we needed. Strange & Norrell is neither one of the host of Harry Potter imitations, nor a Tolkien imitation, nor a New-Wave/hard-SF/Space-opera offering, nor (thankfully) some enormous world-building cycle in imitation of Robert Jordan. Her book is a burst of creativity and light on the fantasy genre and is completely : a re-creation of the 19th century novel dealing not so much with a system of magic but a system of British Thought. It is the sort of considered literature that will introduce many, many readers to the potential of fantasy literature who might otherwise have consigned it to a ghettoof exploitation and imitative vehicles. We believe that Clarke--along with Neal Stephenson operating from the science-fiction side--may have legitimized a path for other writers to explore speculative elements in their historical works where they have otherwise avoided. In fact, to understand how thoroughly Clarke has crossed genre lines, this is the current list from Barnes and Noble of \\"People who bought this book also bought:\\"    The Shadow of the Wind Carlos Ruiz Zafn, Lucia Graves (Translator), Read by Jonathan Davis     Gilead Marilynne Robinson     The Plot Against America Philip Roth     I Am Charlotte Simmons Tom Wolfe     Skinny Dip Carl Hiaasen     Not a fantasy book among them! Compare that with another popular and well-respected female author in Laura Resnick (In Legend Born, The White Dragon, and The Destroyer Goddess) who has all fantasy recommendations:         Goddess of the Ice Realm David Drake     The Grand Crusade Michael A. Stackpole     The King Betrayed Deborah Chester     The Assassin's Edge Juliet E. McKenna     Impossible Odds: A Chronicle of the King's Blades Dave Duncan     Fool's Fate (Tawny Man Series: Book 3) Robin Hobb     Goddess of the Ice Realm David Drake     We don't point this out to cast aspersions on Resnick but rather acknowledge how insulated so many well-considered fantasy authors are and what a leap it is for Susanna Clarke to bring other readers inside.     WHO SHOULD READ:    There are two peculiar but vast audiences that will deeply appreciate this book: those readers who enjoyed Harry Potter from JK Rowlings (but were looking for something a bit more \\"mature\\" or \\"literary\\") and those readers who enjoyed Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle. One of the themes that appears to be operating in Hogwarts is the relationship between master and apprentice but it is a here fully developed and in full flower in Strange and Norrell. Stephenson's interweaving of science-fiction in to historical non-fiction--something we didn't think could possibly be equaled--is done exceptionally well by Clarke with the insertion of her magicians in to the times of the Napoleonic wars. It is a novel that carefully examines the clash of generations within the bright trappings of English humor, Victorian phrasing, and magic. It's a tremendous example of what can be accomplished with some literary talent and the courage to unfetter an imagination. Really a fine, fine effort that we can recommend to almost anyone with the stamina to tackle an 800 page book.     WHO SHOULD PASS:    As in many good works of literature, there is a lack of what we would call action. There is no open conflict in the sense of combat (though one duel). There is a lack of any inking of sexuality from any character. While it is easy to toss this sort of advice out, these lacks echo curiously in a book about conflict, about matrimonial love, and contains large sections actually within the battlegrounds of a war. The entire book, in some sense, is a purely intellectual enterprise--filled with purely intellectual delights. A good foil for Clarke is Stephen Pressfield's historical novels of Greece (The Gates of Fire, The Tides of War, The Last of the Amazons, and The Virtues of War). In Pressfield, we have books that are substantially about violence, conflict, and sex that are intellectual in nature but visceral in its theme. Clarke is precisely the opposite: her books are about the intellect and it is in this realm that she rewards--and rewards greatly! Readers should understand this entering her books and not be dismayed when her characters flatten at the point where one might expect a bit of adrenaline to begin coursing. In all other respects, however, this is a fabulous book.     [...]	2004-12-26

Light proves that ventures in science fiction involving the \\"New Wave\\" are alive and well. Harrison gives us a brilliant addition to the corpus of this sub-canon. We can only hope that its leanness and brevity will influence a wide number of authors who could use a little lesson in succinctness in their writing. The fact that Light is slim and self-contained will increase its readership by orders of magnitude and have that much greater influence on the genre. The fact that Harrison's skill and craft in writing is really unmatched by living authors will also increase its readership. The ideas within the book itself are a bit derivate: multiple dimensional travel, ships that shift with the thoughts of cyborg pilots, immersive virtual reality, quantum mechanics... none of these things are really new, which anyone must admit. Yet the way that Harrison weaves them in to his plot--a plot where he's doing some things that are really interesting and important--will hopefully inspire a great many writers who are currently tricksters and illusionists to attempt something really important of high literary merit. These are all positive influences on the genre.     WHO SHOULD READ THIS:    Really, the recommendation wizard of Amazon.com is right on top of this one. Former readers of Harrison's work, people who enjoyed Harlan Ellison, Jeff VaderMeer, China Mieville, and John Clute will also enjoy Light. It is written for people who enjoy reading books that are self-aware and aware that they are important. It is written for readers who are extremely demanding of their books and demand substance as well as spectacle. It is hard to imagine anyone being disappointed with Light who enters the text with this frame of mind.     WHO SHOULD PASS    There are a few reasons to pass on this book. For example, if murder, masturbation, promiscuous sex, and volition-less, reactive characters get on your nerves than you shouldn't attempt this book. Some critics have accused this book of misogynyand indeed there are few sympathetic female characters and quite a lot of violence towards women. There are some literary purists out there who don't like books that read like Important Books. Light reads like that; it forces you to understand and be aware as active and participatory readers unlike other immersive books--Tolkien being the best example but also works by Wolfe--that are not so self-important and read like legends themselves rather than important works of literature. This is all to say, to fully appreciate Light you need some literary training and the wherewithal to use it. 	2004-12-06

It is an important read for anyone willing and able to change their thinking about how things work, how societies come to be, and how one should go about living theirs. Its scholarship is breathtaking. Its point supremely important and accurate. The Baroque Cycle will not have so much an effect on the genre of speculative fiction as it will on the fiction as a whole and answering the question of why do people bother to read? It is to read things like The Baroque Cycle that we read: to discover things about ourselves and the world around us. It will be interesting to see if, in 10 or 15 years, other authors dare to extend their concept of science fiction in to the past as Stephenson has done.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Anyone who is reading this review has probably already invested a substantial amount of time in reading Quicksilver and The Confusion. It is unthinkable that, after reading those books, that they will not attempt System of the World. We will not deter them--they should run forth and purchase because it is refreshing to see such a work of astonishing scope come to a sort of satisfactory conclusion. The Baroque Cycle as a whole we feel will ultimately become a defining work in literature marking the early 21st century. The only thing that may hold it back is its length, which is daunting but wholly necessary.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />There may be a certain segment reading this series only for Jack Shaftoe and his exploits. While he is here in this book, he is not the focus and he seems somehow diminished in his age. We can't imagine anyone continuing to read these books only for adventure narrative but, if that was your main draw, it is largely absent in System and is much more focused on philosophy, economics, and politics.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-11-28

Most fantasy books can be so good that you don't want to put them down.  You keep turning the pages into the wee hours of the night hoping to find out if Frodo makes it to Mount Doom or if Harry defeats Lord Voldemort.  These books are so good you want to revisit them again and again, each time discovering something new and delightful within the familiar journey.  But with this book, it isn't so much the destination, but the journey itself.  Yeah, Able will probably get to his sword eventually, but what the heck just happened in that last chapter?  You have some idea of what just happened if you were paying attention, but Wolfe has a way of destroying your assumptions.  \\"Did I just read what I thought I read?\\" you continually will ask yourself.  It will not be uncommon for you to begin chapters over again immediately upon finishing them.  You will be compelled to do this.  Only the most well-crafted, densely-layered and tantalizing book could accomplish such a feat.  Wolfe has already established himself as a master of this type of writing.  With The Knight he takes his skills to the next level by creating an intriguing page-turner without sacrificing one whit of his noted literary engineering. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the fantasy genre, then this book also will provide you with some delightful new takes on some old ideas.  Wolfe dips his imagination into the deep pool of Norse mythology complete with its gratuitously violent legends and characters.  His giants are more menacing than the slow-witted, ham-fisted oafs we have come to expect from Disney films and Cartoon Network.  Not a one utters \\"fee, fi, fo, fum!\\"  They are too busy engaging in tactical sneak attack maneuvers to thwart an advancing army or sacking and pillaging a small town.  We also catch lush glimpses of Valhalla, Odin andthe Valkyrie.  These characters have not been Xena-tized for your protection.  They are presented in pure Nordic tradition, glorious, grand violent warts and all. <br /> <br />This is a rich, sumptuous book that just begs to be devoured.  We absolutely loved it. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />While arguably one of his most straightforward and accessible works, The Knight is still brimming with Wolfe's unique brand of literary gamesmanship.  He again employs the \\"unreliable narrator\\" device in order to tell his tale.  While not a liar like Severian nor an apologist like Horn, Able is just too young and naive to perceive the events happening in the world around him.  His attempts to explain complex, metaphysical events are obtuse at best leaving the reader to wonder what exactly is going on.  He does not possess the skills necessary to translate his experience into something we can identify with.  He more or less reports exactly what he sees without providing any sort of cultural context.  Things happen because Able says they do and not because of any logical construct.  Imagine a character seeing a UFO and describing it as \\"this thing flying around\\" and you get some idea of Able's limited narrative abilities.  This might be a realistic approach to writing a book in the voice of a young boy, but after a few chapters of this, a reader may find themselves longing for just a hint of dramatic irony.  They may also wonder why they can't just pick up a book by Gene Wolfe actually written by Gene Wolfe and not a simulacrum of a faulty translator.  If this type of mind teaser does not appeal to you, then it is best to stay out of Wolfe's sandbox.  He owns all the pails and shovels and he is not big on sharing. <br />	2004-11-20

In fact, religious adults who read these books often complain of how profoundly annoyed and attacked they feel. Considered and educated readers will sense what we mean when we say Pullman's arguments become a bit facile by the end. Really, it's too bad--though how it could be avoided, we don't know--that His Dar Materials tackles the notions of faith in the way they do because in all respects they are very finely crafted and well-worth the time to read.

It is not clear to us that Rogue Star was a necessary follow-up to Firestar which could and does stand on its own. Rogue Star on the other hand does not have the kind of strength to stand on its own merits and really only inherits what it had from Firestar. There are some items of great interest here, particularly in the political arena and the Fartrip exploration but now that the notion of a question involving space exploration has been answered there is no longer any suspense or specific interest in the sole nation of space flight. Rogue Star does not offer anything new other than an extension of the relationships involved. And as we have often said, books who create characters independently of the circumstances surrounding the store are not books that will have a great deal of influence on the genre. It will be interesting to see what happens to \\"The Firestar Saga\\" as it continues.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ <br /> <br />As with many sequels, its principle interest will like in those people who read and enjoyed the first book. That is certainly the case here where readers who read and enjoyed Firestar (a remarkably good book) will move on to Rogue Star and find in it a great deal to enjoy. It's still a swift book and those readers will probably find a great deal of satisfaction within it. Additionally, there is quite a bit more detail regarding political events and interplay between opposing political positions--both on the national stage and within the office. There might be a segment of readers who are not terribly interested in the technology and test-flights leading up to space exploration but are more concerned about the politics involved after the technology is proven. For this segment, Rogue Star might even be a more satisfying read than Firestar.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD AVOID <br /> <br />One of the most splendid thing about Firestar was the idea of a dream reified. The notions of privatized space exploration planned so far ahead that education curricula must be altered and redrawn in order to accommodate the dreams is of breathtaking scope and intense interest. All of that has faded with Rogue Star and nothing has really filled its place. For those readers who enjoyed the dream more than anything else they will find Rogue Star faintly but subtly unsatisfying. Mentor, Belinda, and Barry Fast have faded from the narrative almost entirely. There was a great deal of momentum built up in the first book and the series is now running on inertia. While some Really Big Events are revealed near the end of Rogue Star it seems almost more of a gimmick and slightly out of place. Its unclear whether \\"The Firestar Saga\\" will become a viable series or not.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-11-03

It was Donaldson who proved that an author could publish, sell well, and still write something of definitive literary merit. While it is indisputable that Tolkien brought the genre of fantasy into existence it was still widely regarded as something for children (something fantasy fiction still struggles with today) and it is Donaldson who first wrote something that can only be aimed at adults. The Chronicles' influence over the last three decades has been and can be traced to Eddings' Belgariad,  Feist's Riftwar Saga, and any of a host of crossover fantasy novels published in the genre. It's only defect and what prevents it from receiving our highest recommendations is the patina of ugliness that Covenant inevitably breeds. It's an irony about the word because it is the ugliness of Covenant that elevates the rather routine plot into something of literary merit but at the same time it will prevent The Chronicles from being the most cherished in people's minds.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ: <br /> <br />For anyone who has complained that fantasy novels are too lighthearted or too childlike, Donaldson has answered your complaint with a staunch challenge. His Chronicles are a gladiatorial arena where in the pit metaphysics slugs it out not in the pristine abstractions of philosophers but in the blood, sweat, and madness of the arena. It is a terrific blend of pulse-quickening action immersed in carefully constructed philosophy. Any reader versed in philosophical discourse in either free will or ethics will be profoundly moved by Covenant's struggles. At the same time, readers with no taste in philosophy whatsoever who are firmly grounded in a sense of black/white and right/wrong will be equally moved by these books because the battles and action will mean something to them rather than events occurring like so many special effects in some rotten film starring Sylvester Stallone or Jean Claude Van Damme.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />The reader should beware of the content. It's very popular to accuse George RR Martin of having some kind of monopoly on books where bad things happen to really good (and popular) characters. That's not the case at all: next to Donaldson he is a child. Real crimes are committed and terrible sacrifices are made and it is something that the delicate should avoid. Additionally, many readers have been upset with the dense prose and idealized setting of The Chronicles. This is something that's rather important to what the book is about but that doesn't lessen the irritation that some people feel. If you have knee-jerk (and perhaps unwarranted) reactions to overt echoes of Tolkien or have a severe allergic reactions to similes (Donaldson cannot seem to write without liberal use of simile) then you might seek elsewhere.

US	18598228	R3CIV53KNDGXA9	0812530063	756495589	Firestar	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Awakens your dreams... what higher praise?	There is so little buzz out there about this book despite the fact it's put out by a very major publisher in Tor and despite the fact it's so very, very good. Maybe due to the title and cover-art, maybe a lack of marketing by Tor... but who knows? The truth is that it is not widely read nor very popular and that's a shame because it has to be discovered quickly if it's going to enjoy success. Almost no one has reviewed it, few websites have discovered it, it's impossible to find in bookstores, and it's listed as out-of-print at the internet booksellers. We think if it is discovered by what would be a very receptive audience it can have a tremendous (if short-lived) effect on the genre opening whole ranks of near-future speculations on space exploration. We hope for that event! <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />We believe that this book should appeal to a huge audience most especially those who revere the concept of space exploration coming in our generation. It is a tremendous celebration of the human explorer and for those enthusiasts who enjoyed that aspect of Star Trek or Robinson's Red Mars they will find Firestar an immensely satisfying book. Additionally, it will be greatly uplifting for those students nearing high school graduation or first entering college. It is a stupendous argument for taking one's education very seriously and entering the hard sciences or military academies or even better focusing the objectives of business majors. Certainly, for every young person that read and loved Ender's Game and thought they found the ultimate novel, these should turn to Firestar and have their dreams truly awakened.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />There is some complaint over the political aspect of the book, which is said to have a Capitalist bent. This is true to the extent that government is shown as a stumbling bureaucracy and capitalists are shown as something other than greedy scumbags. If you can't stand the thought that private enterprise could successfully launch a space program, then this is not the book for you and you should return to your commune with some other kind of book. We think that both sides of the political argument are dealt with very fairly and depicted perfectly--you have to be some kind of real left-wing nut to feel this way but they're out there. We will say that while certain sentiments in Firestar owe themselves to Atlas Shrugged and perhaps The Fountainhead, it is completely unfair to try and claim Firestar is a similar kind of political diatribe. That is simply not the case. It is a book about dreams and those dreams are reaching beyond our potential. That should be worthwhile for the vast majority of people in any political movement.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-10-14

It's very different from any business book you've ever read. In this case you've found what could be called: \\"it.\\" Robert Greene has published the business book to end all business books.  <br />The 48 Laws of Power are not about inspiring people, organizing people, or making any one feel better about themselves or the people around them. In some cases it is quite the opposite. This is a book that takes an unflinching look at the realities of the business world and what it takes to manipulate, win influence, and--ultimately--gain power. It is with power that a person may begin to shape the world around them and this book provides--in exhaustive detail--the laws themselves, an explanation of the laws, and many distinct historical examples proving these laws and showing how they work.  <br />It really is an absolute manual on how to gain power. Then it's up to you to decide what to do with it.  <br />The most exciting thing about the 48 Laws is how it suggests using the astonishing variety of business literature out there. It will teach you how to create spectacle, how to create a \\"cult-like following,\\" how to \\"preach the need for change\\" but not be damaged by it, and countless other measures. These laws reveal how all the business books out there can be viewed as manipulations themselves in controlling the thoughts and minds of the people who read them. It's hard to measure how important this book actually is.  <br />It is not the case that thisbook reveals idealized Capitalism. We're not suggesting that you use this book as your bible or somehow try to learn something about yourself.  <br />We're not suggesting that this book will inspire you to do great things or reveal how great things come to be.  <br />However, it is immeasurably useful in identifying the political manipulations and power moves that are going on around you. Being able to identify these events and counteract them will allow you to choose the kind of business leader you want to be by deftly dealing with the political realities. You master the laws and wield them or react to them as you see fit--but regardless at least you can now see them. <br />This book will teach you everything there is to know about \\"office politics\\": both how to use and how to react. For any business person who has ever been frustrated or mystified by the machinations of the corporate world then Robert Greene has answered all of your prayers if you will only listen to him.  <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-10-07
US	18598228	R2GQCP90FCIV71	0553803115	677542320	Forty Signs of Rain	Books	5	8	14	N	N	Sadly, it's just a prologue to the trilogy	We're not going to attempt to place the importance of what will ultimately be a trilogy; rather, just this book. As a book--even if it is the first part of a trilogy--it cannot stand on its own merits and will be forgettable by everyone who isn't a member of Greenpeace or otherwise very deeply committed to the politics of global warming. Forty Signs of Rain contains no moments of daring, no startling moments of insight, and certainly none of the sense of wonder or fear that one would normally associate with good science fiction. In fact, absent the references to current and modern politics, this would be a very, very drab book. The moments of charm provided by the main cast of characters are not nearly enough to propel it in to real importance. Without the support of the subsequent novels--which will have to be very good indeed to rescue this book--Rain will very quickly fade in importance.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Those readers familiar with and committed to Robinson's work--particularly the less well-known Antarctica and A Short, Sharp Shock, will probably be right at home and please with this book. As we mentioned above, those people looking to reaffirm a political position of action against the threat of global warming will find a great deal to enjoy about this book and its publication just prior to a big presidential election is nicely timed for those people. It's very hard for us imagine any other kind of audience truly appreciating this book... it certainly is not the best introduction to Robinson's work.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />There are much better disaster novels out there. If you're looking for that particular thrill or insight you shouldn't be looking here. Even if you end up liking Rain to some modest extent you're in for a long wait while Robinson finishes up the next couple of books. Readers of politically conservative convictions (if you like all of Terry Goodkind's preachings you fall in to this camp) will get pretty badly irritated by large portions. Rain is plain rice; it's pancakes without syrup, popcorn without salt and butter, a spouse without in-laws; it's just very, very unremarkable.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-10-01

The series' plot has careened wildly off course into so many disparate places the whole becomes a smorgasbord of ideas with no coherence. Absolution Gap is interesting to many as science-fiction but has little or no value as a work of literature. Thus, its effect or influence on the genre will be very small after an initial publication splash.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Really tough to answer this. Parties who have been compelled by the interesting notion of humanity will evolve will be frustrated by the lack of material and follow-through in the ideas offered in earlier books. Those interested in the inhibitor war will be equally and similarly frustrated to find that it comprises such a very tiny portion of the final book. Really, the reason to read this book is to seek closure in the series--yet even here, there will be a degree of frustration. While our rating as a single book is roughly average as a dnouement to the series it is starkly disappointing.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />Unless you've become immersed in the inhibitor series there isn't much reason to pick this book up. While the plot is fragmented enough that this should be a standalone novel the characters and references all relate to earlier material with no helpful glossing to bring you up to speed. For example, if you read this whole review wondering what an inhibitor was, this book is not a good choice for you. Essentially, if you're looking for a story, go for something else; Absolution Gap is idle speculation dressed up for a Sunday afternoon at the bookstore with a rather pedestrian plot.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-09-28

It is, as Miville himself wanted, wrenching speculative and fantasy fiction out of \\"aping Tolkien\\" where it has been stuck for so long. We might quibble with the notion-Miville is not even close to creating the work of stunning magnitude that is Tolkien (and the fact that he and others are running so far from Tolkien really just points to his continuing and amazing influence)-but he certainly is a profoundly original author and his effects will be widespread and lingering. Any effects that Iron Council itself will have on the genre will, sadly, be only of pedigree inherited from those two earlier books. It is effect by association only and really, when taken by itself, means that the book will have no effect at all.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />There are the fans who love Miville so much that they've almost deified him. They're at least deserving of more respect than those people who are attempting to deify Robert Jordan. They will read Iron Counil and love the thing. They will clamor for more. They read the book for the invention, for the endless parade of mutated creatures and odd bits of magic fused with technology, and for the unique strangeness of the writing. If you fall in to this category then you should read the book because it was written for you. And this is nothing to be ashamed of--our rating is a reflection of how the book will influence the genre not how we personally feel Miville executed his craft. We also learned that there is some reference to Jewish Kabalism, the historical Judah Loew, and the creation of golems in this book that speaks to these older issues. If you're a scholar of golems are Jewish tradition then this book might be an interesting read where it may not be so for others unlearned in these matters. It's hard to recommend this book for anyone else because his earlier books were so much better... from this perspective, there certainly isn't any reason to read Iron Council in isolation.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD AVOID: <br /> <br />All but ardent Miville fans should avoid (we'll not be able to talk the ardent fans into not reading the book after all-they probably finished it before we did). Those who were turned off by the ugliness of the first two books will find no help here-in fact, it's uglier. We get some rather twisted love affairs, a great helping of homosexuality, prostitution, ugly politics, and some of the manipulation that characterized Bellis Coldwine in The Scar. If these things bother you then you will really find Iron Council unpleasant. Oddly, those fans who were desperate to learn more about New Crobuzon and Bas-Lag will find yourselves considerably frustrated-it is the least enlightening book on these subjects so far in all of Miville's writing.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-09-19

We don't believe that it will ever be fully accepted into the New Sun canon but exist outside of it as a separate work despite what Foundation may think. It illuminates a great deal of the material that people may have puzzled over in New Sun and brings up a great deal of new issues to ponder-one of which is one of the greatest coincidences we have seen in any literature anywhere; the kind of coincidence that so impossibly defies probability that one is thrown into a state of pondering the existence of divinity, which no doubt Wolfe intended. This book will not, however, gather the fierce following the original New Sun captured. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />If you enjoyed New Sun it's hard to imagine that you would not read this book and will need little urging from us to go do so. It is rather essential for Wolfe devotees. Anyone who enjoys the unspoken vividness of Eastern philosophy will find a great deal to enjoy here and may derive pleasure out of it without ever having read New Sun. There are occasions here where one is reminded of Siddhartha and other works dealing with consciousness, time, and humanity's place in the universe. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD AVOID: <br /> <br />If New Sun was too hard for you or irritated you, definitely pass. Urth isn't that different. If you haven't read New Sun, you probably shouldn't read this book first-although Reading Urth first and then backtracking to New Sun might provide an interesting experiment in itself. In some ways, that sort of reverse reading is in keeping with principles contained in Urth. Interesting. If that little digression into reverse reading was uninteresting to you and made your head hurt, definitely pass. That's the kind of thing that fills scores of pages in Urth.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-09-19

Certainly it has had profound influence on authors as well as it has on those people who have managed to read the book. Received with almost universal accolades from the critical community, it has not sold well. It has recently been reprinted in omnibus edition and perhaps will enjoy a resurrection of its own. <br /> <br />WHO SHOUDLD READ THIS: <br /> <br />You cannot go on with your life claiming some affiliation with the community of science fiction and not have read New Sun. It is that important. Do not expect any tropes from prior novels to exist here... you are completely unprepared from your prior reading experience. For any enthusiast of Leo Tolstoy, Herman Melville, or other authors deeply concerned with the perception of the human mind-its capabilities, its subtleties, its place as an individual in vast community of minds-you will be enlightened by this book. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD AVOID: <br /> <br />New Sun is a challenge. For fully the first fifth of the book, the reader will often look up and wonder if we and other people who adore this book are in fact quite insane. The reader will ask to himself about Severian, \\"Who is this?\\" with the same bewildered disgust they reserve for inscrutable Saturday Night Live sketches. Gene Wolfe will stretch your mental faculties to their limit and require careful concentration at the most innocuous moments. If you cannot persevere-if you are not looking for works of literary merit in speculative fiction-then seek your pleasure at the altar of Robert Jordan, Orson Scott Card, and the other bestselling sell-outs of the genre.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-09-19

It's that kind of specialized obscurity that allowed \\"grunge music\\" in the Pacific Northwest in the 1990's to be labeled \\"alternative\\" even when it was being played in top-40 radio stations. More and more, people know and recognize this book and author. It's a fine contribution to the dystopias that will continue to be popular as ethics continue to run far behind scientific progress but it's hard to see it re-shaping the entire genre. Certainly, Veniss Underground is a prime candidate for a very good screenplay (though doubtlessly R-rated and might even need some kind of new NC-30 rating). Some patience in writing and we feel VanderMeer could create something truly astounding.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Those who read and enjoyed City of Saints and Madmen or other stories of Ambergris will be very happy with this book. There is a reason that it is receiving glowing reviews and that is because it is good. It should appeal to a large variety of mainstream readers who are interested in the decay prevalent in modernization, the loss of spirituality in the post-modern world, and those who enjoy unraveling dense allegory to classical works and the Bible. Fans of outright horror in their speculative fiction will find this book as delightful and delicious as any meal of Hanibal Lecter's. This would be an excellent selection for any college course syllabus dealing in speculative fiction.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD AVOID: <br /> <br />No matter how good this is, if horror film or horror novels make you queasy and sick, this book is absolutely not for you. Certainly children should be dissuaded from reading this book... probably anybody under 25. If King Rat, Fight Club, or Angel Heart, for example, made you a bit sick then stay far, far away from Veniss and try the slightly more genteel Ambergris. If you haven't read Moby Dick, then you should. Read it first.  <br /> <br />(...)	2004-09-18

We don't think it will change the face of speculative fiction-despite its brilliant moments and the impressive things it has to say about the nature of art-but it may find a long life in the academic community from whom many of the tricks in the narrative were generated and whose population will offer an audience that will enthusiastically embrace its subject.     WHO SHOULD READ THIS:    Any graduate student in English or Fine Arts or Cinema or any such field of study should acquire this in some fashion and read it (we say some fashion because those parties are usually far too poor to purchase a $40 deluxe edition of an obscure book). They will be greatly rewarded in intellectual capital which is their currency. Others of you-especially those who enjoy the short story form-should heed the unspoken message of Moorcock that this is a true work of originality and it should be read if that is what you're looking for.     WHO SHOULD PASS:    The thing is weird! If strange, weird things confuse you (take for example, Naked Lunch, Existenz, or some of the stranger moments in the Matrix trilogy) then you should have deep reservations about delving in to this thing. People who are creeped out by camping in the wilderness overnight or traditional Catholics watching The Exorcist will find themselves deeply frightened and disturbed from reading The Early History of Ambergris. Aspiring writers may quit their profession after reading The Transformation of Martin Lake. This book is strange and deeply unsettling in many ways. Avoid if these things are a bother to you!

It may be that Stephenson's books will continue to leak over towards the shelves labeled \\"literature\\" in bookstores. But there is no doubt that Stephenson's fans are in that most peculiar of communities: the hard-core geek. For all that writers will ever again venture to write about cryptography and the historical rise of computers, the reach of the family Waterhouse will be inescapable. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Certainly fans of prior works of Stephenson should not miss Quicksilver where we feel Stephenson is truly \\"finding his voice\\" as an author. His love of games continues: as we noted above humor and anachronisms abound. More importantly, the notion of Divine Laughter we note in Snow Crash and Cryptonomicon abound here most especially in one of the most amazing heroes of the genre: Jack Shaftoe. For those with an interest in mathematics, European history, computers, or an unquenchable love of life, this book should be read and read again. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />There is going to be a sizable contingent that will not like this book. These people will be those who revel in the thought experiments of sci-fi and fantasy; who seek out those what-ifs that are so often a joy. \\"What if\\" faster than light travel were possible? \\"What if\\" Martians were alive and well. \\"What if\\" artificial intelligence came to be and war began between humans and machines? \\"What if\\" there was a world apart from ours where dragons/elves/faerie/magic/insert-fantasy-element-here actually existed? We're not trying to deride these pleasures-we indulge in them! Merely that this book is absent of them and if it is for that which you read speculative fiction than you will probably not enjoy this book. Similarly, if you need linear, straightforward plots and dislike constant shifting of scene and narrative voice-or dislike your author playing literary tricks and games-you will be constantly annoyed by this book. Quicksilver will require a certain something from its readers and depending upon what side you fall you will either call that something \\"maturity\\" or \\"tolerance.\\"  <br /> <br />(...)	2004-09-17
US	18598228	RQ0F5JPDQ4LE5	0553380958	445913	Snow Crash	Books	5	3	9	N	N	Will utterly change the subject of cyberspace	As we stated above, the book will exert tremendous influence on books concerned with cyberspace. Its accessibility and hilarity will enthrall many, many adoring fans and make Stephenson a pile of money that he richly deserves. Yet it is a book that will not exert much influence beyond this portion of the genre into other media and will not live long outside of the genre itself. The very greatest books transcend genre and move nations-this book will not do that. But we don't feel it really attempts to and completely satisfies its own ambitions. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Cyber-geek? Computer enthusiast? On-line gamer? Hacker? Eskimo? Mafioso? Japanese-American? Cube jockey? If you're any of these people, this book could well become your manifesto. Read and enjoy many times over. It's better than any book of its kind published in the modern English language. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />If you have no sense of humor whatsoever, then do not read this book. We're talking about people who have never smiled at a newspaper comic, have never enjoyed a moment in any sitcom, comedic film, stupid commercial, or street mime. Basically, you'd have to be a Vulcan. It is finally an immensely optimistic book and a distinct pleasure to read. If you're suicidal and looking to check out of this world or are suffused in such a profound fit of post-modern angst that you can't possibly find a moment's cheer in this doomed world, then pass on this and go read Al Gore's book or attend a Ralph Nader speech. You certainly don't need to read this. <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-09-17

It is a necessary portion of the Stephenson corpus, but as a work unto itself will not have profound and lasting influence on the genre of speculative fiction. It will, however, exert a great influence on those books dealing specifically with nanotechnology. We said of Snow Crash \\"it will affect every book about cyberspace for the next generation.\\" We can just as boldly state that The Diamond Age will affect every book about nanotechnology-at least for the large majority of the coming generation. If our review seems overly harsh, it not for lack of affection for a very fine book, but rather expectations that were overly high coming on the heels of Snow Crash. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Stephenson's acute sense of what we call \\"Divine Laughter\\" has not slackened an atom. For fans of Stephenson's earlier work, Diamond is not to be missed and the exhilaration, hilarity, and messianic insight into the human condition are all evident here. Furthermore, MIT students or graduates who are fascinated by machines and nanotechnology will be stupefied-or at least as happy as a pile of geeks suddenly granted Tom Cruise magnetism at a Playboy mansion filled with nubile women versed in Star Trek lore. It will even be impressive for that peculiar redneck geek who watches the Discovery Channel and Comedy Central for pearls like Junkyard Wars and Battlebots. Oddly, parents should read Diamond. At its heart, it is a book about parenting and much better than any parenting books written by pediatricians or PhD's granted from tiny island nations. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />For an introduction to Stephenson, begin with Snow Crash. In the end, it is a better and more relevant book. Most readers of discriminating taste will eventually move on to Diamond but it is best to start with Snow Crash. Turbo-feminists-that hardcore breed that seem incapable of enjoying those various facets of life existing outside of their political agenda like, say, common sense-will have many complaints about Diamond. They will be too blind to see that in many senses it is a celebration of the importance of women-but there is no talking to these creatures. People who hate children should not read this book. Adults who have never enjoyed a moment of Dr Seuss or any other children's book in their adult life should also avoid.  <br /> <br />(...)	2004-09-17
US	18598228	R334CYHY6MSCWI	043935806X	667539744	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Rowlings is getting better	We found ourselves thinking a lot about how this installment would impact the genre. It is, after all, a novel geared towards young adults. We are not, however, elitist literati, so we will not discount it as literature just because it is written with the youngsters in mind.    The effect this novel will have on the genre will be to demonstrate that an author can be a smashing commercial success by writing realistic, flawed and non-idealized characters. This will be a welcome change in a genre that too often finds characters portrayed as unapproachable, iconoclastic figures of mythological aptitude and attitude.     We also believe every adolescent should read this if only to understand that perhaps they actually do not know everything and should maybe just trust and believe that those closest to them generally have their best interests at heart. Sadly, for most of us this is a lesson not learned until much later in life. If at all. We have high hopes, however, that Harry will figure this out.    WHO SHOULD READ THIS:    Obviously, this is an enormously popular series and one would have to wonder why anyone even remotely interested in this series would choose to miss out on it. Non-fans, however will enjoy the mature themes and painfully realistic depictions of adolescents taking their first steps into adulthood. There is a wonderful scene in which Harry is out on his first date. He is not suave, doesn't say just the right things and ends up demonstrating a complete lack of sensitivity and understanding of the fairer sex. This scene was so realistic we began having flashbacks of our own adolescence. When a book makes an emotional connection that powerful, it is more than a gargantuan commercial enterprise. It is art.    WHO SHOULD PASS:    If Harry Potter and the wizarding world that Rowling has created never really connected with you, then you are not going to enjoy this book. There are some events and characters that seem to exist merely as plotdevices. This is most apparent in Harry's antagonistic relationship with the innocuous, one dimensional Malfoy who has become more annoying than menacing. We had hopes that this relationship would bloom into something deliciously competitive. Sadly, it is has become a strained and unbelievable plot device. We also keep wondering why Dumbledore keeps letting this snotty little twit, so obviously aligned with the forces of evil, back into Hogwarts?    (...)	2004-09-13

By existing, this book has actively harmed the genre of speculative fiction. This is precisely why we hated this book so much. By itself, it's relatively harmless. Bad books tend to fall into anonymity to leave way for better works. But this thing is by a famous author, will sell well, and won awards!! We cannot fathom how but because it did, Hominids will overshadow far, far superior works by other authors. That is very, very damaging to the genre because there is nothing redeeming about the book. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ: <br /> <br />If you generally find science fiction too complicated, then this is the book for you. If you find Star Trek and Star Wars technological explanations to be lucid and intellectually satisfying you're going to be in high clover reading this book. If you love to sit around and think about how much the 21st century sucks but don't like to think deeply about why that is or think seriously about solutions, then you're going to love the pieces of social commentary. If you believe the Hugo award is a good determiner of literature, then you should definitely read this book in order to test your faith in this voting process of theirs. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />If you like good science from the likes of Kim Stanley Robinson, Alastair Reynolds in fiction or Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, or Timothy Ferris in non-fiction, or read good laymen journals like Scientific American or Discover, then you'll be mortified by what you read here. Alternate worlds, quantum theory, visiting aliens, and even basic human interaction and dialogue have been done far, far better by other authors. If you're into this stuff, look up Philip Pulman, China Mieville, Jeff VanderMeer, Kim Stanley Robinson, or even page turners like Frank Herbert or Orson Scott Card.

As we stated before, no imaginative work-and probably few real efforts-regarding Mars colonization will be undertaken without feeling the influence of Red Mars. Blue reads more like a poem-a work to affect the conscience and the soul. It lingers in the mind almost as a paean to the Red Mars and the struggles that allowed humans to attain the promise that we now see in them. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ: <br /> <br />People who doubted Robinson after Green Mars should not pass this opportunity. It is nearly required reading for anyone who has started the series to end it here. It is not a quick read and will require the reader to constantly pause and mull over issues. But it is well worth the investment. Such a beautiful love poem to space exploration should be missed by no one who is even casually interested in NASA's efforts. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />This is most definitely not a novel that can stand on its own. It can only be read with the background of Red Mars behind it. Of course, there are elements of Green as well and-while we wish it were otherwise-it's probably necessary to go ahead and read Green first. Green is essential at least for the development of Sax Russell. People who are disturbed by free love, Socialism, and Nietzsche-esque disdain for the common folk have long since abandoned the series and will not be inspired to pick up this book. <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-09-11

Yet, astonishingly, Robinson's book is so good-inspired really-that it is impossible to imagine any future novel of colonization written without feeling the force of Red Mars. It will change the publishing world.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ: <br /> <br />Any person who reads should read this book. Even those readers who tend to eschew not just speculative fiction but fiction itself will find merit in reading this book. It has much to say not just about Mars but also about intelligent people who are placed in stressful positions. Red Mars is one of the very best examples of speculative fiction. It is entirely accessible and could be read by students in high school and enjoyed equally by readers all the way through retirement. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />There are examples, though not graphic, of pre-marital sex. Heterosexuals are occasionally naked with reason. In the final summation, it's really only a PG-13 rated book. This might still give pause to anxious parents who are trying to shelter their kids in some weird church that does not intend the congregation to live in the real world.

It will likely set off a series of imitators who will not succeed in capturing its grandeur. For the overall genre of speculative fiction, we think it will have a very quiet effect. It will very subtly inform those authors who explore reincarnation and religion in their works-Dune would not have been the same had Frank Herbert had the opportunity to first read Years-but because it requires so much of the reader it will escape the attention (or at least the necessary dedication) of many readers and be swallowed in the ocean of publications. Unlike other challenging works such as The Book of the New Sun it does not have the literary mastery to compel its inclusions in the discussions of the literary intelligentsia. It tastes are too specialized. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ: <br /> <br />If you have a strong grasp of history, science, anthropology, and other related fields especially in the liberal arts then you have the necessary schooling for this book. If you are deeply interested in the evolution of human society then you have the requisite interest for this book. For you, this book will be one of the most highly regarded and important books you will read in your lifetime. It will be endlessly fascinating and one to be re-read many times over the course of your life like poetry-the splitting of the book into novellas will make these repetitions easy, instructive, and inescapable. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />If you regard speculative fiction as a form of pleasurable escapism, then this book is not for you. There's nothing here to please those fans of George RR Martin, Terry Goodkind, or David Eddings. Comparing Isaac Asimov's history building in the Foundation trilogy to Years is to compare Coors Light to a single-malt scotch: a thing many people like to a thing far fewer can properly enjoy. You have to an elitist to enjoy this book. Those with less than a 4-year degree in something from an accredited college will not understand a great deal of this book unless you read it alongside a very good encyclopedia. Scholars of Ayn Rand, fanatics of Christianity, or haters of alternate history should all avoid this book at all costs. <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-09-11

Should it be considered as part of the trilogy? Red Mars could stand on its own and we've elected to treat Green Mars independently as well. As such, it deserves its rating of 5: interesting, but derivative of Red Mars. It will have the cumulative influence on the genre that it will enjoy for being a part of the trilogy, but ultimately it is only a bridge between Red Mars and Blue Mars with little to say on its own behalf. Aside, of course, from the creation of Sax Russell. Our rating and belief in the Mars trilogy as a whole is much stronger than the individual rating of this book. Taken as part of a trilogy, our rating would be higher. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Anyone who read and enjoyed Red Mars will likely feel good about proceeding along with Green. This will be a very large number of people indeed. There will be many people who vociferously disagree with us and think it is just as good or even more so. We think they're nave clowns like the fellow who reviewed for curledup.com but that won't dismiss how they feel about the book. Any scientist should absolutely read this book-even in the absence of having read Red Mars-in order to be introduced to Sax Russell. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD AVOID: <br /> <br />If you're a right-wing zealot, you probably won't be able to get over the politics. A good example is the TV show West Wing. If you can't stand to watch that show, you're going to find Green Mars equally irritating. The hippie sex increases quite a bit as well. If Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land offended your sensibilities, you'll find those same parallels here.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-09-11

(Disclosure:  we may have read that last sentence somewhere else, so if you are the original author, send us a note and we will cite you.

This is a very dense and layered book.  Not only is it difficult to grasp what is occurring at a given moment, but as soon as a chapter begins to build some steam and we begin to empathize with the characters, the plot abruptly halts and switches to one of the other, various parallel plot lines.  He keeps his characters at arm's length from the reader.  We never get the chance to connect emotionally with any of them.  The only character in the book that we seem to identify with isn't even human.  Oreb the talking bird can communicate more in his disyllabic utterances than the other characters can in pages of dialogue.   <br /> <br />His main characters also have a tendency to speak in a very stylized slang that is difficult to understand.  Others may speak in the Queen's English, but employ extremely annoying mannerisms interspersing their words with non-words such as \\"ah, uh, um, ahem, etc.\\" in dialogue passages that may continue for several pages.  These parts cannot be \\"skimmed\\" because they may contain important plot points.  The abused reader is then required to slog through these frustrating lines.  Any reader who manages to finish every word of these books should be mailed a Merit Badge by the publisher. <br /> <br />A novel needs to be more than an exercise in sterile word-smithing and genius plot-development.  At some point, the reader wants to actually enjoy what they are reading.   Stephen King put it best when he wrote about the unspoken agreement between the author and reader.

However, the violence runs much deeper than those books. While LeGuin can match some of the inevitability of destiny and the sadness it generates that Hearn employs so effectively, Brilliance soundly defeats LeGuin in the sense of romance. But the themes--particularly the sexual themes--are treated in a much more adult fashion including very frank scenes of sex--often with fornication or adultery involved--homosexuality, and cruelty. It is still unclear if Hearn was ultimately aiming for that particular audience of youthful readers but we feel that that is still where it will end up. It will be interesting to see what rating the movies earn from the MPAA. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />All of the fans who were at least casually interested in the trilogy Tales of the Otori should purchase and read this book in order to finish it out. Particularly those readers who were disappointed by Grass for his Pillow should give Hearn a second chance because she delivers grandly here. The series has catered to youthful readers craving to read about honor, loyalty, revenge, and love all encapsulated in the solipsistic world of the very precocious and the very young--Moon continues and excels in this vein.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />All those readers who love the \\"smash-mouth\\" style of big, bloody battles and nubile young women in the vein of Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind will probably not have made it this far in the series having long since gone back to more masculine fare. But if they have ventured this far, they will continue to be disappointed if they look to the Otori to answer such vices. No reader should pick up the series by starting with the final book--as is the case with many trilogies, much of its strength comes from earlier works. Please go to books 1 and 2 if you've not yet read them. If you're from the raving Christian Right you may have rightly heard there are Christian themes celebrated here. There are. But there is also a good deal of adult sex including homosexuality--perhaps you shouldn't be letting your sheltered children read for that reason. But we think you've got to be pretty turbo-Christian to feel this way.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-09-03

But as is the fate with may of these interminable-seeming series, it is beginning to flag and decompose under its own weight. This novel will have little overall effect on the genre and in fact has little to no effect even on its own universe. It almost acts as a bridge novel between Revelation Space and whatever it is that's coming next (rendering Chasm City all but forgotten). Few people, certainly, will read this book more than once. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Is there anything good about this book? Sort of. If you're desperately interested in the universe that Reynolds has created, then you will find some sections of this book interesting. But even Reynolds fanatics will have little use for the entire book. There really is no other reason to buy Redemption Ark in anything other than mass-market paperback. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />Anyone who isn't a huge fan for some reason or another should pass. In fact, if you're a big fan, you may want to not read this book since it mildly harms its predecessors. There are plenty of reviewers out there who disagree with us, but if you're here and reading this review then you should trust us. There are far, far better books out there for you to read.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-09-01

There are writers who are superb at the science but not very good at the writing: they write average books. This one falls in the latter category. Reynolds is indeed extremely good at the science, but he does not add enough of it into this book to sustain his few moments of brilliant thought. The book will end up being forgettable and exert little influence on the genre itself. In the end, it will be derivative of Revelation Space and interesting only to fans that read and enjoyed that work. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />If you were very intrigued by Revelation Space and want to hear more about Sky's Edge, Yellowstone, and some the effects of the melding plague, then you will be delighted by this book and should not pass it up. Other readers who deeply enjoy mystery novels and would like to read one done passably well that is set in space will enjoy this book as well.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />While the novel can be read independently, it should not be. If you haven't read Revelation Space first, then you should probably pass. For those of you who were not terribly interested in the science of Reynolds' earlier novel and were irritated by the lack of characterization, you will find some advancement in Chasm City, but not enough to warrant you picking up and reading this book. This sort of book has been done and done better by other authors.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-09-01

Few will end up compulsively re-reading the book but rather recall it to mind when reading from the press about advances in nanotechnology and artificial intelligence. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Any person who indulges in non-fiction science will find this a stunning book and disagree violently with this review. Readers who are familiar with Fermi's Paradox, the Drake Equation, and Schrdinger's Cat should definitely read. This is an excellent novel with which to introduce new readers into speculative fiction. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />Readers who are not overly impressed by scientific expertise and don't find enjoyment in trying to match actual science with their own imagination should definitely pass. If you're a person who is quite satisfied every time Geordi LaForge finds a new use for neutrino beams to save the day and prefers the metaphor behind the event, than this book is not for you.

It is actually more appropriate here, for Bellis Coldwine is the sort of anti-hero first envisioned by Donaldson though here even more brilliantly written. We feel this work will have similar impact making it a force in the genre for at least a generation or two and possibly more. Miville has opened the floodgates of his imagination and his scientific speculations about remade, about possible futures, and about even the undead, will have influence over many future writers. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS <br /> <br />This book is a must read for any devotee of speculative fiction-it is one of its very best examples. For any one who has been awed by the finale of Conrad's Heart of Darkness, The Scar will reverberate for a lifetime. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS <br /> <br />For Perdido, we said this is \\"not an easy read and not for the squeamish.\\" The same ugliness exists here. This book is not for children and only for serious readers. If you're looking to pass some time with the sci-fi equivalent of a soap opera, you'll be served better by the inferior works of Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, and Terry Goodkind.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-27

In very important ways, he is operating in a different arena. We believe this is due to the fact that Pressfield's earlier books dealt specifically with historical events and only now is he moving to the more speculative realm of mythology. But Pressfield is not doing anything different than the many authors attempting to write about the mythology surrounding King Arthur (which are, of course, legion). What is refreshing is that Pressfield, who already is identified as a good scholar and authority on classical literature, has made an offering to the realm of speculative fiction and that elevates the entire genre. Its 5 is deserved (even if a touch disappointing) and it is a welcome breath of new possibilities to serve as examples for other authors not to mention a solace of respectability for the genre. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />It's hard for we men to decide what is good for women, but female readers, we believe-and most especially young women-will identify with Amazons and read it with great relish. Fans of Pressfield's earlier books will also find the shift to mythology engaging and refreshing. High school and perhaps introductory college courses could do much worse than assigning Amazons as part of the regular course syllabus. We're great believers in historical fiction in general and this is a splendid blend of mythology and history. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br /> <br />The language is extremely formal and nobody in the book laughs much nor is having a particularly good life. There is a great deal of bloodshed. Moreover, there is a pervasive pall of grief cast over the entire book. If you're looking for something optimistic, fun, or something that will cause you to laugh, then go somewhere else. If your urge to read is centered around narrative perspective then you'll also be rather disappointed with this book. This book is for classical scholars, historians, and lovers of mythology and/or Greek philosophy. <br /> <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-27

It is neither science fiction nor fantasy and will be overlooked by many of those readers. It likely belongs in the shelf with other horror novels where its redeeming qualities will likely be overlooked by legion fans adoring vampires, psychic abilities, and X-philes looking for a new home. Its future may lie closest on the screen for which it is exquisitely well suited. Once there it will give rise to a wealth of mainstream readers who will adore its ferocity, puerility, and pace. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />If there was ever a book that served as an oasis for the connoisseur of speculative fiction, it is King Rat. Very quick, quite short, and immensely engaging it carries just enough political weight and psychological angst to be well worth the invested time without causing sleepless nights pondering its mysteries. A 5-hour plane ride coming up? There is no better book. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />Certainly if you're squeamish of rotten food, rats, or spiders, then this is no the book for you. Similarly, it is a novel rife with coarse language, violence, filth, and enough remorseless sentiment over modern humanity to give pause to the pure still among us. Do not expect redemption from Saul.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-25

It has many similarities to some of the finest creative works of Japanese anime which are completely unfettered by conventions, realities, or rules and should do particularly well among those fans. It has wrenched itself so violently away from convention that its force will be felt across many genres, audiences, and authors. Yet its unrelieved corruption and ugliness will prevent it from reaching across generations. Our highest compliments to Miville yet his book does not change nor improve the lives of the people living on this planet and so fails to attain our highest rating. It will burn so very brightly for a long period of time, but then fade. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Readers looking for something new and different, fans of anime, those familiar enough with physics to imagine and enjoy the impossible born from the theoretical, and enthusiasts of dire monsters threatening populations will read and reread Perdido Street Station many times over. The imaginative force by itself is spectacular and should not be missed by any reader of speculative fiction. This book will be a feast for any reader starving for the original and the thrilling.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />The matter under discussion is ugly. In the entire city of New Crobuzon, there is nothing beautiful, nothing grows, and no one is at peace. The absence of Mother Nature is felt only as unconscious longing and that longing mostly generated from the reader rather than the character. The colors of the world are, almost without exception, unrelieved soot. There is a rather bewildering penchant for all the characters-from the educated elite to the sewer villains-to use the worst profanity available in the modern English. This is not an easy read and certainly not for the squeamish. People rise to a challenge in order to reach George Orwell's 1984 and they will do the same here.   <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-25

In fact, there's some pretty compelling arguments why it could be considered the best novel of the 20th century. This from the critics.  <br /> <br />It's also an enormous international bestseller. That is to say, it's not some kind of weird, experimental thing with some enormous political axe to grind that normally wins Pulitzers and garners accolades from the effete in their ivory towers. This is a book that all kinds of people from all walks of life have read and enjoyed. <br /> <br />Business Leader take note: when a book touches both the masses and the critics then something has been written that touches a chord in all humanity. This is something that you can learn from and use in your business setting. These books reveal the secrets about how everybody feels. It helps you violate the law against fooling all of the people all of the time, so to speak.  <br /> <br />We believe that Catch-22 has something even more special to offer. It reveals the truth about bureaucracy.  <br /> <br />It's a lot of fun today--and really has been since the time of the trustbusters in the age of Theodore Roosevelt--to hate big giant corporations. You can't sit in a coffee shop without hearing someone rant about Big Business and the evils it perpetrated upon the environment and people of struggling nations. You can't turn to fiction without constantly seeing Big Business presented as an all-consuming evil that manipulates nations and lives to its whims. The press has long delighted in portraying Big Business as preying upon the decent, the common, and the innocent.  <br /> <br />And in some cases they may be right.  <br /> <br />But there is a different truth. It is the truth that Big Business can't possibly organize itself and come to the kind of consensus necessary to prosecutethe vast majority of the injustices for which they're blamed. The simple truth of the matter is that bureaucracy--that maelstrom of decayed policies, outdated procedures, the futile and whimsical direction of middle-managers who have given up home, the ambitious subterfuge of self-serving middle-managers who are--or perceive that they are--on their way up, all crashing together like the planetessimiles in a proto-solar system bound together by the gravity of a thousand conflicting agenda, beliefs, and ideals... that bureaucracy prevents.  <br /> <br />Big Business blunders. It blunders its way through the world achieving much more by accident than it ever does by intent. It is why Big Businesses, which has always founded its strength upon originality, daring, and speed retreat to defense in lawyers and regulations when they age and suddenly find themselves stagnant, timid, and slow. The inevitable gravitational pull of bureaucracy on any Big Business pulls all to an entropic heat death.  <br /> <br />Catch-22 is a case study in exactly that kind of bureaucracy. It is the bureaucracy of the military--but really the same infectious bureaucracy found everywhere--as it attempts to win a war. An endless display of very real people are introduced to this blender of military bureaucracy and it is reduced to the terrible comedic.  <br /> <br />People love to read this book because it is so funny. But it's funny because the bureaucracy is so familiar. The people's behavior remind us of how the world really works outside of the board rooms, court rooms, and throne rooms.  <br /> <br />Every business leader should read this book if only to become so intimately familiar with the face of bureaucracy, which will always be the final and most terrible enemy that any business can face.  <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-25

Additionally, anyone who is chilled by predestination and fate will be obsessive about reading this book; it is foreordination in one the most compelling forms we have ever read. It's enjoyed great acclaim among devotees of the fantasy genre but--unlike Jordan, Goodkind, Eddings and Brooks--Martin fully deserves the praise for his perfect craftsmanship of the world he has created. For readers very suspicious of the fantasy genre being able to produce anything of note, this is an excellent introduction for it acknowledges the fact that there is a lot more to be had in books then \\"Get the sword,\\" \\"Save the Girl,\\" and \\"Kill the monster.\\"<br /><br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:<br /><br />The book does not have happy endings in its many subplots. Justice does not often prevail. The weak are not often saved by the just. There is course language-though never seeming out of place. There is violence. This is not a book that should be read to children. It is most definitely R-rated material. Also, if there is any flaw to the writing, it is in that there is little self-reflection or introspection in the characters and also little or no philosophy to the Seven Kingdoms. If this is the reason you read then you would be better served by Gene Wolfe or perhaps Kim Stanley Robinson.<br /><br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-24

(Adventures of a Curious Character)	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Good Business Reading	Science Digest is quoted on the cover as saying:  <br /> <br />One of the most famous science books of our time, the phenomenal national bestseller that, \\"buzzes with energy, anecdote and life. It almost makes you want to become a physicist.\\" <br /> <br />Compare with the Chicago Sun Times quoted on the first page announcing, \\"Hilarious, exhilarating...\\" and the Detroit Free Press echoing, \\"If a single book can shatter the stereotype of the stuffy scientist, this may be the one.\\" <br /> <br />Now, the first publication is a science magazine of some good reputation who caters to people who could charitably be called \\"eggheads.\\" The fact that these people consider something funny is one thing but the fact that the mainstream press can consider the same book funny when the only science they've whiffed in the last 3 decades of their lives is from the general university requirement they barely passed as a freshman on their way to get some kind of liberal arts degree.  <br /> <br />Now consider that this book is a national bestseller many times over, has spawned multiple editions and re-printings, and a variety of sequels--one can only assume that Feynman has touched a chord in the mainstream population as well (at least the book-reading mainstream population).  <br /> <br />What can this possibly mean to the business reader?  <br /> <br />Two things.  <br /> <br />First, that it is possible for really smart people working in extremely esoteric fields to have a profound effect on an astonishingly broad cross-section of people. This is very important to any executive who is 1) probably far more educated than the majority of people in his industry, 2) can seem very forbidding due to his rank in the company, and 3) who is constantly challenged with trying to figure out how to motivate the office proletariat that is in truth the heart and soul of any company.  <br /> <br />Just look at the shelves in any business section in any bookstore and you see all kinds of those weird books with numbered laws blaring out anecdotes that are really some sort of pacifying opiate to placate the rebellious and discontented who dwell in cubicles. And as the anecdote goes, if any of these books had the real answer would there be so many of them?  <br /> <br />That leads us to the second point: what this book is about is LIFE. It is about a person who is going about living exactly the kind of LIFE that everyone wishes in their head to lead. But he does it. And best, by his LIVING he positively affects those around him in to living as well. Now, the business books try and talk about business but what better way to motivate people than by talking about their LIFE? <br /> <br />Not only is this a lesson in motivation through example and action for any executive but it is also a guidebook about how the executive should go forth in his career. Feynman very casually shatters notions of immutable laws in society and business. He tramples over social mores and niceties like an elephant in a flower garden. He blithely breaks procedural laws and office political codes with the same aplomb that he creates new laws in quantum mechanics out of the ashes of standard particle physics.  <br /> <br /> <br />Feynman is a model for the business executive who feels trapped by politics, by procedures, or by industry. He will teach you how to perceive your job and place in the world in such a way that you'll either change your job or change jobs--change your company or change the industry. For all the weirdo business books that strive to tell you how to keep objectives, higher level goals, and mission statements in mind it is a physicist--Feynman--that shows you how to do it. And makes you laugh along the way.  <br /> <br />All in a 346 page book that you can probably finish on a plane flight to one of those stupid summit meetings in Chicago or some other metropolis.  <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-24

There are so very few great fantasy series-we admit this-that anyone who sneers at fantasy as the poor second cousin to sci-fi should pick the series up and see what it has to offer.

Avoid if that's a problem for you. Readers that are incorrigibly high-minded or are looking to stretch their philosophical muscles will be disappointed this book.

It is best for the children to stay away from them lest they reveal something unpleasant that for everyone's sake was better off remaining hidden.

One almost gets the impression that Brian wrote this awful, insipid book to exact revenge on his father for causing some horrific, adolescent trauma. The Dune series was most known for the intricate and compelling \\"plots within plots within plots\\". The plots and intrigue in this book are boring, plodding and constructed like some sort of literary Rube Goldberg machine. \\"Plods within plods within plods\\" is a more accurate description. It was known that this was the first book in a planned three book series. After finishing this book, we were not anticipating reading further installments.

If the reader would rather avoid such painful regrets, then trust our review and avoid this book at all costs.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-23

The Book of the Short Sun will be one of the finest reading experiences of your life... if you can get through the thing. The difficulty in extracting those rewards out of the text is considerable and not to be lightly discounted. Reading these books will require supreme effort. Willing readers will have to be intensely interested with how individuals relate to historical and semi-mythical figures, religion, and their own personality as influenced by these themes. These books are about as far as you can get from the popular concept of \\"space opera\\" and thrilling, \\"page-turning\\" fiction. An analogy to Moby Dick is probably very appropriate as that work due to the very slow pacing, the introspection, and the great literary symbols stomping through the setting reified and alive. Any scholar of literature should be deeply fascinated by these books.     WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:    There is no shame in not reading these books. They are terribly difficult and an exercise in stamina though we feel most people should at least try once. If you have attempted Shakespeare and been turned back because of the language; if you have attempted Moby Dick or novels by Henry James only to be turned away by the lack of progression in the plot; if you have attempted James Joyce's Ulysses but been baffled by the interior monologue, then Short Sun is probably going to daunt you as well. But we feel the rewards of this book are equal to those giants in literature.     (...)	2004-08-23

If you enjoy reading the exploits of peripheral characters from better works of fiction, then this is the book for you. If you taped all the episodes of AfterM*A*S*H (both of them), then you are the demographic target of this book. Indulge yourself. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />As speculative fiction goes, this is really just a harmless, banal book. What pushes it into the territory of the truly awful is its pedigree. Frank Herbert's Dune is one of the world's greatest works of speculative fiction. It is a masterpiece that stands alone and does not need any \\"prequels\\" to expound on any of its plotlines. We liken this to the necessity of writing a prequel to \\"Hamlet\\". No author would even think about committing such an affront to literature. For these reasons, the Dune prequels earn more of our ill-will than other similar mediocre works of speculative fiction.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-23

People who really liked Across the Nightingale Floor will rush to this book and rightly so. Despite our mediocre rating, there's nothing wrong with this book and nothing embarrassing about liking it. There is an undeniable beauty to the prose and the storyline is satisfying enough. While it's not Great Literature it is certainly engaging and just as certainly a very brisk read. Despite some very adult moments, precocious readers ages 11-16, we feel, will particularly like this book and the others in the trilogy. Japanophiles will also like this book though we feel they'll have more fun pointing out inconsistencies with the \\"real Japan\\" once they find out that Hearn is actually named Rubinstein and was born in England. Those readers looking for succinct beauty should go buy--it can be dusted off in a weekend. <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />Just as certainly, potential readers need to read its predecessor and be very prepared to purchase the final book. There is absolutely no closure here and if you want a self-contained story, go somewhere else. The book is at once both intensely introspective and romantic--these are the dominant themes and if you're not looking for that kind of material, then pass. No super action here! though there is a bit of martial arts. Adults who can get annoyed with books that may be said to overly celebrate youth will likely be pretty annoyed by this book and should pass.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-20

WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />Only extremely fervent fans of Mr. Goodkind should read this book. We mean the kind of fans that have somehow misconstrued earlier works as important in their lives. And these stalwarts only if they can stand some truly sadistic stuff. Although the novel is self-contained, there is absolutely no reason to read this book without having read the first three. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />If you didn't like where Blood of the Fold was going as far as sex and violence (or lack of plot development), stop. End your acquisition of Truth novels. Certainly if you're squeamish about sexual torture, do not read this book. This is a pretty good example of what happens to a pretty decent series when it gets drunk on its own success.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-19

WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />If you're enthralled with the Truth sequence, go ahead and read this book. It satisfyingly extends some of the characters and one might find revisiting them refreshing. As scifiguys noted, though, do not expect serious advancement in the sequence. Do not go out of your way to buy this book in hardcover. Save it for some sort of \\"rainy day\\" when nothing better is going on and you're looking for reasons not to clean the house. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />You want something more than a new episode in a soap opera? Then pass. If nudity, sex, violence, and Murphy's Law realized in several coincidental cruelties across hundreds of pages are not, by themselves, going to do it for you, then definitely pass.

The book could be titled: What Happened to Gar and Other Important Matters. It's likable enough as the sort of pulp fantasy fiction that many readers enjoy on a plane or at the beach or perhaps visiting the in-laws and looking for an escape. In short, to qualify as a buyer, you should: <br /> <br />1) Have read Wizard's First Rule (and liked it) <br /> <br />2) Have Read Stone of Tears (and liked it too) <br /> <br />3) Want to read something but not in the mood to look for something new. <br /> <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />I'm afraid we don't have any earth shattering insight to offer here about a rather pedestrian book. Nothing but fun-no highbrow literature here. If you're looking for something important, seek elsewhere. But you knew that from the first two books. The sex stuff has escalated to levels that parents should prohibit the book from children below a certain maturity level. Imagine a pretty intense R-rated slasher flick in text and you'll have a pretty good idea.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-19

No reason that you must read Wizard's First Rule first, just buy this one and dive right in. It's quite self-contained. It has the advantage over the Wheel of Time books in that it is self-contained and does not take hundreds of pages reiterating prior events. For those people who delight in reading action-oriented tales in the vein of Dragonlance, early Shannara works, and others then this is a book in which you will delight.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />There is quite a bit of violence here as well as a bit of sex. Nothing that kids won't find on the sci-fi channel, but the descriptions are rather more brutal than customary and give a flavor of realism that will give people pause. Maybe keep away from soft-hearted or very young children (maybe also away from children you've noticed tormenting small animals). If you are looking to read a book that will seriously change how you look at the world, pass. You will not find that kind of writing here.

But it's possible that we've totally missed the boat on this one. There are plenty of critics who didn't get The Silmarillion, The Book of the New Sun, and Ulysses when they came out. Pretty much unthinkable to us, but possible. If you really enjoy a challenge in words and are comfortable with reading settings that seem like a drug-induced hallucination trip, then you might really, really like this book. Those with puerile interests in reading about sex will probably like this book quite a lot. If you thought there was little cooler in life than Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas-book or movie-you might give this thing a try. <br /> <br />WHO sHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />The Law of Diminishing Returns should apply here. There are deeper books that will yield better returns with much less investment. You would do well to concentrate your energies on those books. Perhaps Library Journal was right and this book really is appropriate for \\"large sci-fi collections.\\" If you've reached a point where you've comfortably read anything very good that might be out there and you can't seem to find anything new and different, why then this thing might be next on your list. But that has got to be a very, very select group of people John Clute is probably one of them, actually.  <br /> <br />READ THE WHOLE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-15

If you're a producer of such games, read this book, find Farland, and sign him to a contract. The premise of this book would make a very cool game. If you've ever thought that a card, board, or computer game would make a particularly good novel, then you should read this book because you'll quickly realize why this is a particularly bad idea.  <br /> <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />Everyone else should pass. There are such better books out there. If you're reading this review looking for something lighthearted and fast to take on a long vacation, there is much better. This thing's a waste of time. We have reviewed lots of fast-reads that have scored a better. Go to our site and look for those.

Die-hard fans of this stripe rarely are concerned about character development or strikingly original writing but pay much more attention to how cool the magic is and how realistic the battle scenes are. These readers also rely on convention and formula and really often only looking for energetic retellings of a familiar story. Goodkind delivers grandly if you accept these limitations. Particularly, the battle scenes seem strikingly realistic (or so it seems to us, we've never been in battle).  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />Wizard is a very entertaining read for fantasy fans, but it won't be as well understood by other readers used to other conventions. Certainly fans outside of the speculative genre altogether should pass on this book if they're attempting to explore such material for the first time. Goodkind relies heavily on the reader's familiarity with fantasy convention and an audience which doesn't readily accept characters who can shoot lightning out of their hands with no causal explanation whatsoever should look elsewhere for their first taste of writing in this genre. There is nothing here that could be called High Literature in any sense of the word so unless you're looking for simple mind-blowing action (and well-drawn action we again hasten to add), you should pass.   <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-15

Absolutely anyone. All ages, all fields, all nationalities. Chiang is the kind of writer who can single-handedly change a genre. Especial notice to those fans of Ray Bradbury whose moods and internal conflicts as a concept are echoed (and surpassed!) in these tales. <br /> <br />wHO sHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />It's hard to imagine anyone who bothers to read at all would not gain something profound from reading at least some of these works. But the, they are absent of cursing, violence, and sexual titillation. Those of you who seek super-action or other thrill-seeking vehicles should seek out Goodkind or some other author to satisfy these baser needs and return to Chiang when that catharsis is over. <br /> <br />READ THE WHOLE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-15

Though be prepared to rehash a lot of old ground! Other than those individuals, we can't really recommend this book to anyone not already familiar with the story. It does not break new ground or provide any interesting concepts such to warrant an independent read of its own (in fact, it ends with yet another cliffhanger and the promise of yet another 500 page book). We suppose that those parties intensely interested in Hawaiian myth might be interested in the treatment of the goddess Dar. If you delight in seeing religion mixed with politics to the exclusion of other merits in a book then you might also be satisfied with the treatment of Tansen, Josarian, Zarien, and the dictates of their various deities.  <br /> <br />wHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />Other writers have taken up these subjects and done them better. Certainly for the ultimate treatise on religion and politics you should take up Dune by Frank Herbert from which so much of this book is taken. Huge fans of Herbert should stay well away from this whole series lest cries of plagiarism arise and pollute the waters.  <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-13

As a study of group dynamics and clashing personality types within a disaster setting there really is nothing else like it in the genre. A good segment of the reading public would be those people who enjoy reading mysteries not so much for the dnouement but rather for how the various parties think and act would adore River. Also, those readers steeped in religion will find the allegorical implications of people operating in the absence of God profoundly affected by the ending of this tale. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />This book requires an incredible amount of patience. There will be times that even these most patient readers will be tempted to give up and move on. The detailed examination of each and every crewmember plus their motivations and desires is so exhaustive and so unrelenting that you've really got to be into this kind of thing to even venture into the River. The plot moves at about the same pace as the stars wheel in the sky. For those readers who have blazed through English Lit courses in college, River reads, for good or ill, very much like a Henry James novel--horribly trying but with immense rewards. If you are the sort of reader who looks for immediate payoff--and that, without being insulting, is certainly a large body of the speculative fiction reading public--then you should look for something else.  <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-13

None. Reading it only makes you angry, bitter, and unhappy. If you bear any love of any kind for Ender Wiggin of Ender's Game, then you must not read this book lest you destroy that memory forever. <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />You know, maybe Tor has made enough money robbing the graves of superior authors and pressing living authors of potential into some kind of servitude in working for their private pulp mill.

Why you should read this. <br /> <br />People who can't get enough of Ender Wiggin will indulge themselves and enjoy this book. They will be disappointed and will likely not re-read it a second time but they will not regret the purchase. People easily fascinated with metaphysical issues but don't want to have to think about them too hard will end up liking some of the bits about Path but again won't be doing any re-reading. People doing critical research about \\"Good Authors Gone Bad\\" will find this book a singularly instructive performance. <br /> <br />Why you should pass.  <br /> <br />Don't pick this book as an introduction to Orson Scott Card. Instead, take Ender's Game or Pastwatch. Perhaps even The Worthing Saga. There are many, many readers who liked Ender's Game a great deal but were only marginally interested in Speaker. If you were one of those readers, do not read this book. It's not more Ender; it is more Speaker. Don't pick up this book thinking it's a quick read: it's not. It is longer and more didactic as Publisher's Weekly correctly pointed out, without any of the pacing that was so exhilarating in Ender's Game. <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-08-10

The ones with all the Japanes comic books. The collection of anime DVD?s. The samurai swords mounted on the wall. The unnatural affection for movies featuring marital arts. These peculiar people we affectionately refer to as ?japan-ophiles? will love this book?particularly younger readers getting into more advanced and adult books for the first time. There is a great deal of merit in the writing techniques that lead to the beautiful and flowing settings. The book is also very short in this age of dictionary sized fantasy novels and a very, very fast read. Not only des this make it very appealing to the aforementioned younger audiences but also makes it a good vacation for adults from more heady fare. It is also a very beautifully set book with a very pure narrative that is direct and unassuming?a huge departure from other mainstream stuff. If you?re looking to just get away from all the despair, dystopias, sarcasm, and emotional angst of post-modern literature, the Hearn offers great solace.  <br /> <br /> <br />Why You Should Pass <br /> <br />The greatness of books, we feel, is measured in the characters and how they teach us about ourselves in their behavior and reasoning. If you agree with us, this book will end up disappointing you. While a coming-of-age novel, it is of little help to those people coming of age. While adults will be reminded of events in their past upon reading the exploits of Takeo and Kaede, they will not gain new insight in to themselves. Nightingale will have the impact of those very pretty songs on the radio where all but a refrain or a phrase is forgotten and?while that fragment is pleasing?it is not lingered over but only occasionally recalled to mind at some external stimulus.

If you're a parent of a gifted child then you should regard this book as non-fiction. Anyone looking for a very good book to read over the weekend or during some other short interim of time then there are really no finer books. Ender's Game is an excellent book to give or recommend to someone unfamiliar with the genre who isn't desirous of much in the way of high-brow literature. If you've read other books by Card and are (rightly) puzzled and disgusted at his iconic status then you should give this one a try. <br />Why You Should Pass<br />There is an extraordinary amount of hype surrounding this book. Do not flip the cover open expecting to have your life changed. Have realistic expectations for what it is: a decent book with mass-market appeal.

It is life-changing, genre-changing, and has founded whole political movements. Today it is not read so much as devoured by youth of reason and ambition as they shrug off the shackles of guilt and political correctness that institutional education, politics, and the general masses-teeming and oozing the strange sort of emasculating goodwill that pervades and weakens the early 21st century-have foisted on them through their early years. There is no truer book of Capitalism and freedom for the English-speaking world. No man may call himself a champion of the free market without first having read Atlas Shrugged. <br /> <br />Atlas Shrugged will explain to the reader the true value of money; why economies built upon freedom are a great evolutionary leap in ethics; and why those who earn wealth should feel the opposite of guilty. <br /> <br />Atlas Shrugged will unveil why and how the government is, in the end, a final evil and an enemy of free thought. Rand will explain why it is the government that must be fettered and not individuals. <br /> <br />The plot will unveil how people are seduced into the siren song of equality and how terrible their arguments and weapons of persuasion are for they prey upon the good conscious of those they seek to destroy. <br /> <br />For every business owner who sweated over taxes, and regulations. For every heir to fortune or person of wealth who stood silent while insults were hurled at them for no other reason than the wealth itself. For every Capitalist who ever watched the news, grated his teeth, and thought: \\"Fine, then. I'll quit!\\" This book will be your new Bible. <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-06-30

None at all. Even if you're interested in what's going on with Richard and Kahlan and the war in D'hara... well, nothing's moved on that front in 4 books ever since Richard and Kahlan went off to Anderith to put a vote to the people regarding entry in to D'hara. From there it was Richard's sulk fest and abduction to the Old World. Then we got Oba and Jenssen going around the world. And now this little detour into Bandakar. But even aside from the lack of movement, the book is really bad. It's redundant of its predecessors, it's preachy, and it's full of bad philosophy. Even those reading these books for the sadistic pleasure of all the rape and misogyny are going to be made because none of that is here either. Really, Goodkind has disappointed everyone with this book. <br />Why You Should Pass<br />If there is an ounce of willpower in you to stop reading this series of books. If you can muster up the courage to break the cycle of addiction and look to a new author, do it. You can't possibly be happy with this book when you're done reading it. Not and be a breathing, thinking, human being. Let us help. There are other books. Better books. Inchoatus can help you. But first you have to help yourself... just put... the book... down... and slowly step away... <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-06-30

His wit, his prose, his dialogue, his drawing of characters, they really are almost unsurpassed. We feel that Stephenson continues to improve as a writer in general and those characters of Eliza, Jack, Waterhouse, Leibniz, and Newton have never been so palpably real. For those who were thrilled with Quicksilver, we feel they will be even happier with The Confusion. The anachronisms will seem less jarring, the progress of the novel is more linear and easier to follow, the writing a bit tighter. This is the central novel of an astonishing trilogy of books and one should most certainly continue them once started. For those interested in the history of calculus and in general the Age of Enlightenment, this is not a novel to be missed. <br />Why you should pass:<br />We don't believe that one should begin any trilogy with the second book. If you've not read Quicksilver, then you can muddle your way through this book-and probably be happy with it-but really it loses some depth. As before, if you're expecting laser gun battles, space wars, robots, or other tropes of sci-fi you ought to go elsewhere for those thrills. While this is generally quick read, the book is long and therefore heavy to drag around. If length will perturb you, wait to read this book until you have the time, leisure, and muscle to take it on. <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-06-30

He has an excellent and well-paying job. He has a wife. He has children. He has a lovely house.<br />Yet he finds his life shallow and empty of purpose. He finds himself indulging in self-destructive behaviors. He finds himself completely unable to communicate with his family. He finds himself completely unable to connect in any genuine sense with any other person in his work or social life.<br />He examines every facet of his life from his job, to his marriage, to his children, and he finds that a strange sort of cowardice pervades his life. He realizes that \\"something happened\\" in his life to change everything he knew and every way he behaved and made him the ineffectual, pompous, and empty coward that he and all the people around him have become.<br />For those people in the business community who have pondered their own existence and the true results and purpose they will have on the world, this novel will read like a kick in the groin. Something Happened is a completely unsettling and unflinching look at the kind of life that is derivative of one spent in the service of a business. It will teach you why you fear everyone you work with and why they fear you. It will teach you why you so often feel so alone. And it will teach you why you learn to break free and why you may be so unable to do it.	2004-06-30

That's what it's like for a sci-fi fan in Generation X+ to read I, Robot for the first time. The whole history, etymology, and evolution of androids in science fiction is, in some sense derivative, of this book. If this appeals to you-that is, if learning about the heritage of science fiction appeals to you-then this book will be a delightful read.<br />Why You Should Pass<br /> <br />The movie... well, the movie is shaping up to look like something between A.I. and The Terminator with a little bit of Tom Cruise from The Minority Report thrown in. The movie could be great. However, good or bad, all of these kinds of things are terrifically absent from Asimov's I, Robot. If you're looking for action and adventure, sex and vengeance, humanity on the edge of extinction, well you couldn't go more wrong than reading this book. This is a very calm and cerebral look at some problems that might crop up with programming robots and set in situations that really aren't staged terribly well. Sort of like showing a music video of The Beatles in concert to a group of teenagers more used to MTV. <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-06-30

If you haven't seen it yet, go see it. The movie is fine but doesn't do the language justice... nor the music if the stage production is done well. It's worth owning because some of the speeches are as resonant with us today in the modern area as Shakespeare's were in years past. <br />And this play has a special significance for those in the business world. It is the greatest lesson in humility that can be taught. Salieri delivers the line near the beginning that strikes at the hear of all business leaders: <br />We [musicians and composers] gave them [political leaders] processions for their strutting, serenades for their rutting, high horns for their hunting, and drums for their wars. Trumpets sounded when they entered the world and trumpets groaned when they left it! The savor of their days remain behind because of us, our music still remembered while their politics are long forgotten. Tell me, before you call us servants, who served whom? And who, I wonder, in your generations, will immortalize you?<br />Is this not the final goal of the business leader? Not to be wealthy but to be relevant? To make a mark on your world that will not be dimmed by time? To change things irrevocably because you and no other were there? <br />It is to this pride and to this ambition that Amadeus speaks. Salieri, as gifted as he is, is dimmed by the talents of another. A wholly undeserving other. And it throws Salieri into a spiral of hatred, of vengeance, of energy devoted to conflict. It is a lesson that we who seek to change the business world should heed. Instead of extirpation, should not Salieri have sought other means? Could not Mozart have been controlled, manipulated, exploited to serve the aims of Salieri? <br />Consuming vengeance is seldom useful in the business world and overweening pride leads ultimately and inevitably to downfall. Humility is the hardest lesson for the elite to learn. Learn it from this play and the life Salieri rather than at the end of your own.<br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-06-30

If you're at this site, then chances are you're sort of sick of business books. Probably, that's a kind way of saying it. Seeing another book by Stephen Covey or some other idiot spouting out laws, truths, and platitudes in big print, wide-margined, brightly colored business books inscribed with fulsome praise from every other author of big print, wide-margined, brightly colored business books probably makes you ill like you just ate something slimy that fell out of the nostril of a leprous hippopotamus. <br />Or else it makes you so angry that the rest of the business world (that is to say, all those bleating sheep that come up with words like \\"consens\\" and \\"mute points\\") expects you to converse in this stuff that you have to read it and be able to remember authors when you could be using your time more wisely  like beating your head over and over and over again with bowling pin. <br />If that's the case, this is the book for you. <br />Buckley and Tierney have written the book that everyone who ever wanted to scream in despair and fury at The Oz Principle can worship. It is an excoriation of all the senseless business books that infect our lives. <br />It is the story of a group of monks who begin to become wealthy by pure happenstance (or perhaps through miracles) and find themselves suddenly regarded as business men. So, to run their business they hire marketing people, public relations people, and all begin to read books by Deepak Chopra and the like. <br />The result, as you might imagine, is not a very sound fiscal enterprise. <br />The wit is sharp and biting. It is required reading for anyone who ever read one of the 7 habits and thought that their life was changed. <br />It's an amazingly fresh example of why acumen, expertise, and intelligence can never be truly replaced. <br />It teaches the businessman to ignore the bleating of sheep. <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-06-09

While there are many instruction manuals in the world that teach the strong how to be strong and the great minds to compete in the business world, this is the only book that delves into the minds of the 21st century male. <br />We are a nation of men who have been told violence is never okay. That it is never permissible to hit another person. That the only permissible course of action in any conflict is to call for authority and await the outcome. <br />Fight Club teaches us how the male has been emasculated and all about the simmering violence that lies just beneath that can be exploited or-worse-ignored at great peril. <br />The book speaks loudly about marketing and merchandise but really the book is about conflict and how competition has really become a bad word in modern day America. <br />Think this isn't true? Look at how businesses compete today? Most operations would rather coexist peacefully with their competitors. Most managers would rather play it safe. Most executives foster images of humility. <br />Fight Club teaches us about the absolute necessity of competition in order to channel the violence and aggression into constructive and important aims. Left to fester, violence boils like an infection just beneath the skin and will, ultimately, find release in some fashion. The Greeks knew this; they called it Katharsis. <br />This book will teach you why you have to fight. <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-06-09

Why You Should Read This<br />People who are really into Catholic history or Borgias specifically will be delighted to read this book. Similarly, people who are really into Grimm's Fairy tales and other children's literature as adults and love to ponder the implications they have on society and see them reinvented will relish this book. Readers who have enjoyed Maguire's Wicked and Confessions should read this book. It is quite an interesting book for anyone with passing familiarity with Snow White and any sort of soft heart for fantasy elements in their book. This is an excellent choice for light or quick reading in any situation (airport, vacation with the in-laws, etc.) that will hold the interest of the educated reader. <br />Why You Should Pass<br />People who enjoy historical fiction for the historical part and generally abhor the fantastic should not read this book. Of course, those people are probably not reading anything at Inchoatus but it goes without saying that this is not a book to introduce these kinds of skeptics to the realm of fantasy books in speculative fiction. Readers who like their literature very, very serious should avoid for the many affectations of children's literature that Maguire produces. Some individuals may end up being disappointed by the lack of depth in the storytelling. <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM	2004-06-08
