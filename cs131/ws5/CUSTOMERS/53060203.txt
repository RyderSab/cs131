James Ward has constructed some very interesting characters, and done a fair bit of world building in this novel of magic on the high seas. Magic works a bit differently here, with a bit of Newtonian cause and effect, and there are a good assortment of demons, giants, sprites and other assorted standard magical creatures. And setting the story in a Horatio Hornblower-like framework was frankly a stroke of brilliance. The problem comes in that the plot is a choppy grouping of chapters that take you through Midshipwizard Halcyon Blithe's training in no particular order, with no foreshadowing of things to come, and little insight to his past. There is no clear beginning, middle and end -- but the reader does stay involved in wanting to find out what is still to come. The ending feels unresolved, probably to signal that further tales are to follow.A worthy novel, with a few structural problems, but still worth the read. Recommended.	2005-09-05

The AMERICAN HEROES series was created to provide solidly researched popular biographies of heroic American icons for a wide audience, especially for younger readers who are \\"exploring the rich tapestry of American history for the first time.\\" Rod Miller, a popular writer of the American West, has done this job magnificently in JOHN MUIR: MAGNIFICENT TRAMP. John Muir comes alive as the immigrant from Scotland who rose from farmer, to sawmill worker, to one of the most revered authorities on the botany, glaciers and forestry of the American West. Rod Miller's JOHN MUIR pays tribute to the father of the American conservation movement and its resulting seeds of environmental awareness, and honors the founder of the Sierra Club. From Muir's humble beginnings to his later more visionary belief in nature's rich resources, Miller's prose uncovers an amazing historical tale for all Americans to feel pride in. Highly Recommended for readers of all ages.	2005-08-19

He makes logical extrapolations of science, religion and politics in the near future, and leaves the fantastical to other authors. The Skytower backstory for MERCURY owes much to Arthur C. Clarke's FOUNTAINS OF PARADISE, David Gerrold's more recent descriptions of a \\"beanstalk\\" in JUMPING OFF THE PLANET, and its demise is perhaps one of the best examples of future terrorism fueled as much by corporate greed as by religious fanaticism.If you have read any of Bova's novels VENUS, JUPITER, or SATURN--then you will already be familiar with a few of the characters that reappear. I find this one of the most appealing features of The Grand Tour Series, that they are not dependent on each other, but they are linked by characters and a near future \\"universe\\" that feels comfortably familiar, even in it's twisted politics and collapsed ecology. Highly recommended.	2005-08-16

Her beautifully written stories are masterpieces of historical fiction -- being meticulously researched and finely told -- and I never fail to learn something new about the world, and about St. Germain.<br /><br />In this newest adventure, the Count is a trader in Yang-Chau (Shanghai) China in 535 A.D., a year known as the Year of the Dark Sun. It was named this due to the eruption of Krakatoa -- a rare, once in a millenium scale event that blocked the sun to varying degrees around the world, and caused starvation and panic where ever the clouds of ash prevailed. A fine novel, full of energized plotlines and well rounded characters. Highly recommended.	2005-06-05

Gardner Dozois has once again put together a collection of short speculative fiction that every reader of science fiction should have on their shelf. It is filled with a twenty year progression of stories that both reflect the times they were written, and their relevance today as well.<br /><br />Dozois did a very wise thing while putting together this anthology by choosing stories that made the most significant impact on him as a reader, rather than picking award winners or short stories that have been widely reprinted.

It really is unfair to market this novel in any way attached to THE DAVINCI CODE, either good or bad. It really has no similairities which is both good and bad. The plot moves forward well enough, and the scholarship regarding Egyptian mysticism, heiroglyphics and the Stela of Paser are well researched--but the protagonist is neither a hero or anti-hero, in fact he is pretty much the most poorly developed character in the book. And the plot resolution is so empty and open ended to make you question where the author was trying to go. Not a bad novel overall, and I see the author can handle both the heady world of acedemia and the depths of seedy sex and drug culture to equal proportion, yet a bit unsatisfying.	2005-06-04

Matheson has had a long and distinguished career as a writer of speculative fiction -- sometimes fitting better in the science fiction category, and sometimes more in horror, but always solid, imaginative fiction. EARTHBOUND is another of his tales that truly defies easy genre classification as it effortlessly blends elements of suspense and horror in a tale that is both a supernatural chiller and suspense filled tale of obsession. Unholy desires fill the beautiful and mysterious Marianna that comes to visit David, the protagonist, whenever his wife is away. This leads to a spiral of depravity, fear and guilt for David--and a chilling conclusion that exposes secrets that lie deep in the past. Truly a tortuously entertaining tale that is highly recommended.	2005-05-11

Caldwell and Thomason have written a real champion here by fusing excellent writing with elements of intrigue and suspense. There is a palpable hypnotic power to their writing, much as the mysteriously coded manuscript of the Hypnerotomachia has held the fascination and obsession of it's readers over the past five centuries. The collision of the human elements, all searching in a web of madness, genius and human frailty - is much like watching a train collision - both alluring and yet grotesque.

He was truly a man of his time, in a critical era that is frequently misinterpreted, even today.<br /><br />Ron Chernow has created a truly balanced and expansive biography that captures many sides to this fascinating American. Hamilton's passion, wit and genius shine through in this dramatic saga, and it leaves you wondering how America has come to be run by half-wit, passionless political puppets. It shows clearly how the Founding Fathers actually stood for their own ideals, and argued vehemently in their favor. A refreshing start to a country gone astray. Highly Recommended.	2004-07-06

Based on the 1977 novelette &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; the Tor novel debuted in 1985. It was both a Nebula and Hugo Award winner, which shows that both fans and fellow science fiction writers thought this was a novel of distinction. I heartily agree, having originally read the novelette more than 25 years ago, the novel at least twice in the first year it was published, and having contemplated the social questions it raised many times in the intervening decades.<br /><br />Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin thinks he is playing computer-simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever-harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.<br /><br />Since the original stories publication, our language and society has changed so dramatically, that it is good to see how well the original theme has held up. Unfortunately, the later books in the series (After `Speaker for the Dead') did not have the verve and impact to keep my attention. The character \\"Ender\\" was distorted by time, age and experience - creating a less sympathetic being than the one portrayed in this far-future coming-of-age story.<br /><br />Please do read this novel in the context of the time it was written. Reagan was president of the US, the Soviet Union was still his \\"Evil Empire,\\" rap and hip-hop had not filled every niche of society with swear words, personal computers were just making slight in-roads into society, and there was still a bit of innocence in the world. A fine novel - highly recommended.	2004-07-06

In a suitably complex plot, the story comes alive in the Elizabethan issues of marriage outside of ones class, anti-Semitism, and daily life in London's underworld. The level of detail shows that Hawke is fully comfortable in portraying this blend of historical fact and fiction. A good read, filled with a few unexpected twists and turns, and a number of tongue in cheek allusions to Shakespeare's plays that keep you grinning. A pleasant quick read for a spring or summer afternoon.	2004-05-22

If you read the author's debut novel, \\"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom,\\" then you already know that he is an immensely talented writer - quirky, humorous, edgy and brimming with the kind of future ideas that are keeping the genre fresh. His sharp writing and creativity have produced another superb novel in \\"Eastern Standard Tribe.\\" Borrowing a few tricks from Wm. Burroughs, and inventing a few of his own, Doctorow tales a magnificently complex tale of humanity in the deceit-ridden near future, where instantaneous wireless communications and omnipresent computer systems are the warp and weft that make up the fabric of everyday life.<br /><br />Art, the protagonist, is brilliantly portrayed as the interface designer who is on one hand a defacto industrial spy - screwing those he works for in the name of his Tribe. Unfortunately, what goes around, comes around in the karmic way his partner and girlfriend make use of Art's revolutionary ideas.<br /><br />One last comment, the gifted way Cory Doctorow portrays Art as he sits atop the sanatorium, contemplating homebrew lobotomies and the difference between being smart vs. being happy - well, it is some of the most vivid writing I have read this year, bordering on genius, and ringing true to those of us who have also had the hamster wheel spinning in our head.

It touches on History, Design, Literature, Creativity and so many other areas with a zeal and passion that is rarely seen these days. It also is one of the most beautiful books just to page through as well. I have had several people pick my copy up and browse it briefly, only to get enthralled in the text and illustrations.<br /><br />Ms. Kirschenbaum has written and designed a masterpiece that I hope will soon become a standard on the shelf of every design school, and it should be in the library of every graphic designer as well. Editors and publishers could also benefit to see that today's technologies need not only yield the standard black and white of yesterday's printing techniques-and all could benefit from books that engage the readers as actively as television and computers do at the present.<br /><br />Beautiful, thoughtfully written, and quite engaging.

I usually abhor prequels categorically; however, after faithfully reading the first half dozen novels in this series, I was hoping to learn the full story of Lieutenant Bak's exile from the charioteers to his placement in Buhen as an inexperienced policeman. Unfortunately, in this latest published novel from Lauren Haney, there was less than adequate information in this area. Instead you are given a bit more of an expanded story that has been alluded to before, and instead you get to join the freshly appointed policeman on his first investigation.<br /><br />With that said, 'Flesh of the God' is a highly entertaining addition to this series and explores the real reasons why Buhen was located so far along the Nile - as a convenient access for routes to the gold mines found in the southern deserts. Haney deftly tells volumes about Egypt by guiding the reader through Bak's investigation of the murder of Buhen's capable commandant. What would otherwise have been a conventional murder mystery is transformed into an educational and entertaining story that keeps you guessing until the very end.	2003-09-14

Haney has managed to create characters that engage and plotlines that maintain interest, without falling into the highly romanticized stylings that seem so prevalent in lesser works of historic fiction. The gritty sense-of-place woven through tight story lines keeps the action fast paced while transporting the reader back through the centuries.<br />In 'A Cruel Deceit,' Inspector Bak is thrust into interwoven mysteries during a visit to Waset for the eleven-day Feast of Opet. Even before Bak has had a chance to settle in for his visit, a Hittite horse-trader is found mysteriously murdered, and soon Bak and his Medjay policemen find themselves called upon to assist in an ever expanding wave of suspicious deaths. The conspiracies and politics among the government and the priests makes this tale a bit confusing for those unfamiliar with the times in Egypt, but they truly are fascinating and drive the plot forward. Highly Recommended.	2003-09-14

A twisted plotline keeps you jumping, and the usual mix of Harris's urban shape-changers, vampires and werewolves make for a highly entertaining story.<br /><br />Simply a pleasure to read; and if you are a fan of Laurell K.

Miguel Lienzo, a Portugese Jew and trader on the commodities exchange, has entered into a partnership with Gertuid, a widowed Dutchwoman. They are set to corner the market on coffee, which is just becoming known as a drink to evoke the mind, rather than dull it the way alcholic beverages do.<br />It is a novel of repressed longing, misdeeds and the Jewish community of Amsterdam. The protagonist is haunted by his past and is harassed by the \\"parnass\\" of his synagogue. Amazingly little to do with coffee, and mostly to do with Jewish persecution within it's own community. Not as good as the author's first novel, and much over rated.	2003-04-09

Eisler has created a vivid portrait of the man who was blessed with musical genius and success -- and the love for the infamous woman novelist George Sand. Chopin was revered by contemporaries such as Schumann and Liszt, and after an early success dwindled away to a very unhappy demise.<br />Not much new territory here, but Benita Eisler has made a contemporary biography that truly brings Chopin's life to light in a book that is both compelling and creative.

An equal mix of adrenaline and testosterone that feels like a season script for the TV show \\"24\\" - or maybe a Bruce Willis miniseries.<br /><br />The writing is solid but the author has the annoying habit of referring to the September 11 / World Trade Center attacks so many times (nearly every other page in the first 50 pages - and much more towards the end), that this reader got tired of it. It is as if he keeps doing a George W. Bush impression-repeating Sept. 11 as a Mantra, trying unsuccessfully to push emotional buttons without reason-and looking stupid because of it.<br /><br />Not my favorite book by Peneiro, but a good solid read with lots of action and suspense.	2003-03-14

In _Much Ado About Murder_, Hawke has recaptured the sly wit and droll humor of his main characters, and writes a rather straight forward mystery that is most enjoyable. Instead of weaving a story filled with useless red herrings, he has used restraint and created a story that shows imagination and talent in it's very simplicity.

It does a wonderful job of enlightening the issues related to genetic engineering (specifically Germline therapy), exposing the pros and cons in a way that does not smack of being a blatantly cautionary tale. It is a thought provoking trip that truly shows human motivations and behavior as the driving force behind scientific advances. Hasn't it always been money, greed or war that most propelled mankind in it's most significant leaps of history? I wonder what this really says about mankind?<br />The language and science can be a bit hard to follow, but if you approach the novel with an open mind and allow yourself to be educated as you go along, I don't think you will be disappointed. This is not some purely fluff novel -- it has real thought and intelligence woven in to a fast moving<br />thriller that enlightens as it entertains.	2003-01-18

Not just for fans of miltary sci-fi, these adventures of Jack Storm, the last Dominion Knight, are enjoyable stories of adventure and a quest for justice. I applaud Daw Books for releasing these novels in this 3-in-1 paperback format that is a true bargain in these days of corporate greed. And it is a pleasure to be able to re-read these tales in order, as the individual books have been out of print for some time.<br />The universe created here by Charles Ingrid may not be filled with many new or novel scientific angles, but the very familiar feel of &quot;The Dominion&quot; and even of their foe &quot;The Thraks,&quot; has a very comfortable feel. It is like picking up a well thumbed old Robert Heinlein novel, where the characters and their plots are different, but all else feels very familiar.	2003-01-18

At first I was put off by the author setting these tales in the the whorehouse know as &quot;the Old Priory Guesthouse&quot; but I was eventually won over by the well drawn characters and high level of historical detail. The plot moves along nicely and has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing, and the dramatic conclusion is a logical consequence of the suspenseful storyline. Twelfth-century England has not been so well portrayed since Ellis' Brother Cadfael series... and it seems not so far away in the humanity described between these pages.

The fast paced storyline is part mystery, part adventure, and all science fiction--combined in a highly-accessible style. Highly recommended.	2002-10-20

In the hotbed of intrigue that is Rome in 48 BC, Caesar is away chasing Pompey in their struggle for Empire, the populous is divided in their allegiances and life goes on. The wives, daughters, lovers and family members of the power brokers of Rome are all caught up in this most recent tale of Gordianus the Finder. It is a departure from the last two books in the Roma Sub Rosa series that concentrated on political maneuverings and military operations, now returning to a more \\"human\\" centered tale involving the women of Rome; giving a face to historical figures that went without more than casual mention in the histories written by men, for men, about men.<br /><br />This is probably Steven Saylor's most non-linear novel to date. It weaves back and forth through the events surrounding the murder of his latest case, who also happens to be his mistress. The story telling has been taken to a new level in this novel, and Steven Saylor deserves the highest accolades for his work here. Am I being too enthusiastic? I think not. A truly wonderful tale that is highly recommended.	2002-06-01

Wilson sets out to address is possibly the most important we have ever faced: \\"Are we entering a critical period in our biological and ecological history, from which we may never emerge?\\"<br /><br />`The Future of Life' is Wilson's most urgent, inspiring and intellectually nourishing books to date. It is a compelling call to arms to avert the global extinction episode that we are currently in the midst of. Our current mode may rival the one that wiped out the dinosaurs 60 million years ago-without the need of any single catastrophic event to help it along.<br /><br />This volume is destined to go down as one of the most important books of far-seeing cautionary discussion, much as Rachel Carson's `Silent Spring' did a generation or two ago. Highly recommended.	2002-06-01

An interesting mix of plot lines and solid writing keeps this tale moving along at a brisk pace. The characters are interesting, but the book as a whole is not as challenging as the authors Nebula winning novel \\"The Falling Woman,\\" or the multiple award winning novella \\"Bones.\\"<br />Overall, a very solid and satisfying story, but with a few quibbles. Why do authors' feel the need to include \\"Ockham's Razor\\" and \\"Schroedinger's Cat\\" as principles that need inclusion and explanation? Along with \\"Gordian Knot\\" and \\"Damocles Sword\\" these must be the most overused clich&eacute;s of science fiction and I am very tired of reading them. And what ever compelled the author to name so many characters after herself? It might seem humorous to some, but it really spoiled the rhythm of the story for me.<br />Still, I do recommend giving this book a good reading, to expand your thinking a bit while getting a good dose of entertainment.	2002-06-01

If you are looking for an excellent resource on the history of Japan in the past 4 centuries, I recommend this book highly. It does an excellent job in tracing the tortuous path that wove from Japan's feudal fiefdom society to the current modern parliamentary democracy. In addition to the governmental and military matters that are generally covered, there is notable space dedicated to the arts and the contributions of women, peasants and others not normally found in history books.

If you enjoyed James Clavell's &quot;Shogun,&quot; then this series of books by Laura Joh Rowland may appeal to you. Her descriptions bring to life the world of 17th Century Japan under the rule of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, both the noble and the gritty. Her protagonist Sano Ichiro is a creation of his family's circumstances, serving as yoriki, a senior police commander for the city of Edo.<br />Small quibbles aside, this is novel is a quite enjoyable read and definitely gives you a wonderful introduction into the characters and settings that follow up in later books of the series.

It is a wonderful work of fiction that makes some timely predictions about the 21st century (and beyond) and how mankind may cope with the many changes that are coming. It follows loosely behind his \\"Moonwar\\" series, which brings in settings and a character or two on Selene, the lunar city where much of this novel takes place.<br /><br />THE PRECIPICE also incorporates and expands on much of the scientific and technological advances that have appeared in Dr. Bova's books over the past decade-including nanotechnology, fusion power, and some very practical approaches to spaceflight within the boundaries of our solar system. A highly recommended novel, followed by THE ROCK RATS, book 2 in the Asteroid Wars series.	2002-03-30

I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a very enjoyable read; a suspenseful science fiction novel filled with espionage and action. The idea of cloning from ancient DNA is not new (Jurassic Park, need I say more) but the idea of \\"blending\\" personalities inherent in DNA was a new twist, handled very well. The archaeological aspects in Alexandria were also well described and made for some vibrant settings.<br /><br />One of the highlights of this novel was the way Scarborough develops her characters into unique individuals that are easy to associate with, both good and evil. The protagonist and antagonist(s) are people that truly act out according to their personal beliefs and values-a very human trait which often gets left behind in science fiction works. I highly recommend this book-entertaining, engaging and full of plot twists that keep your interest.	2002-03-30

For anyone with even a mild interest in geology, this book is one of the most fascinating biographies of the year. William Smith was a self-educated surveyor and canal digger who overcame tremendous obstacles to reveal the very foundations of modern geology. Winchester tells this fascinating tale of intellectual history in a wonderfully accessible manner, using clear and striking language to weave a compelling historical tale. The subject matter truly comes to life in Simon Winchester's skilled storytelling.<br /><br />If you like intellectual histories/biographies such as Lesley and Roy Adkin's \\"The Keys of Egypt,\\" Dana Sobel's \\"Longitude,\\" or Giles Milton's \\"Nathaniel's Nutmeg,\\" then give this book a try and I don't think you will be disappointed.	2002-03-06

The storylines finally do intersect and begin to weave together with varying rates of success. The socio-anthopological complexity that is inherent in both the human and alien cultures is strange and sometimes hard to understand, but the overall concept is fascinating, if disgusting at how mankind can be so &quot;in-human.&quot;<br /><br />There are a number of mysteries generated that are not resolved until the last few pages, and there are several storylines that go unresolved making you wonder if a sequel is pending. The writing is solid, the characters well defined (if somewhat unlikable), and the pace/action moves along briskly. Recommended for those who enjoy reading a bit of military sci-fi mixed with a bit of hardcore and sociological sci-fi.	2002-02-03

It successfully takes a hard science fiction story and incorporates unique ideas on physics, interstellar colinization, religion and politics into an entertaining blend. The tension between the &quot;Burnout Kingdoms&quot; and the mainstream society of Mandala really makes the story work well.

Andrew Swann brings a fresh voice to the fantasy genre with this novel and his no-nonsense protagonist, reporter Kline Maxwell. The Dashiel Hammett-like noir setting pervades throught the story and makes for a very enjoyable read. There are lots of lines like &quot;(s)he had one of those personalities that tore into a room like a rototiller into a vat of Jell-O.&quot; They may be a bit hokey, but fun to read none-the-less.<br /><br />One quibble is that the author misuses &quot;irony&quot; or &quot;ironic&quot; no less than a dozen times.

Second in the series, this novel picks up right where A MYSTERY OF ERRORS left off. Symington \\"Tuck\\" Smythe is unsure of his role in the company of players that he and Will Shakespeare have joined, and he is doubly vexed by the state of his romance that occupies nearly all his waking thoughts. When the players are contracted to provide theatrical entertainment as part of a large wedding pageant, Tuck \\"volunteers\\" Will into becoming the writer of their production, a role that may \\"make or break\\" him as a major talent. The only problem is that a series of murders turns the event of the year from a marriage celebration into a funeral.<br /><br />I found this tale far more satisfying that the first in the series, particularly as the language used by characters is, for the most part, far more convincing. The Elizabethan-period politics, familial chicanery and villainy all make for a delightful mix of historical fact and fiction. Light-hearted, humorous and convincing in plot-I can highly recommend this for your shelf of historical mysteries.	2001-12-30

Robinson has set up a series of mysteries that truly bring the era to life. The struggle of re-building faith in the years following the devastating rule of heretic Pharaoh Akhenaten and his bride Nefertiti makes for fascinating and entertaining reading.<br /><br />Lord Meren, the Pharaoh's chief protector and investigator, is recovering from injuries sustained while previously attempting to resolve the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of the Queen. It is an 11-year old mystery that deeply distresses Tutankhamun and it's solving has expanded to involve Lord Meren's family members, trusted assistants and even Anath, the Eyes of Babylon. The field of suspects has narrowed, the circumstances of Nefertiti's last days are becoming clearer and the resolution is both exciting and satisfying.<br /><br />Indeed, this is the best novel of the series as it provides clear means and motive for the mystery. There are red herrings aplenty and Robinson relies much less on supernatural trappings and solutions that appear in earlier books. I may not agree with her fictional interpretation of history, but I genuinely applaud her skill at weaving a highly entertaining and enlightening novel. Highly Recommended.	2001-12-30

The setting on the asteroid Ceres is extremely well developed as is the race of genetically altered humans who ultimately are the blue-skinned \\"Meek,\\" able to withstand almost no atmosphere and intense environmental conditions. Scott Mackay has superb \\"world-building\\" skills that are not often seen outside a handful of classic SF writers.<br /><br />While the plot moves along at a brisk pace, there is a slow but steady revelation of characters' pasts which form a complex history of the evolution of \\"The Meek\\" from human to \\"Orphan,\\" to their current level of development. This back-story provides the motivations and logic behind the novel and is managed in a sure-handed manner. I found myself frequently wondering about both the ethics and possibilities that such drastic genetic alterations could cause both to the existing structure of human kind-and our future place in the universe. A satisfying read that gives you much to mull over once the story is finished.	2001-12-30

In this age of anthrax scares and threats of biological terrorism, this novel is not only fortuitously topical-but twice as frightening by the relevance of the subject matter. `Maelstrom' returns to the characters and story begun in Peter Watts' `Starfish,' where a disease vector from the distant pre-human past was discovered in a deep ocean rift. A secret underwater nuclear strike was employed in an attempt at the sterilization/containment of the `disease,' but Lenie Clarke has survived and has inadvertently become the Typhoid Mary carrying the potential death of the human race.<br /><br />We learn much about Clarke's interior topography as she tries to make her way home, possessed by a desire for revenge against the forces that ordered her `sterilization.' Inadvertently she becomes the Meltdown Madonna, a media/web induced celebrity and urban myth rolled in one-a rage filled carrier of death.<br /><br />Peter Watts fine writing has created a genre others call cyberpunk noir, but it is really much more than that. And it defies simple labeling. `Maelstrom' is dark, gritty and vivid-yet eerily redemptive in it's own way. Highly Recommended, even if you missed `Starfish.'	2001-12-13

If you are Allen Meisner, a card carrying mad scientist, you make your trials aboard one of the highly visible US space shuttles, then disburse plans and information for free through the Internet, and wait for the thanks of a grateful planet.<br /><br />Is it no surprise that instead of accolades, the human race goes nuts-governments in chaos, nuclear doom imminent, the whole thing put down as a hoax-and Meisner becoming a fugitive from the law.<br /><br />Jerry Oltion has created something magnificent in this humorously sarcastic novel of personal fulfillment and interstellar exploration. There is a Spider Robinson-like quality to the dark humor and sometime slapstick adventure, but it is infused with a warped wisdom and very solid writing that makes a true SF adventure. The main characters and the aliens they encounter are funny and clever, stopping just short of becoming caricatures. There is vision mixed with the humor making this an irresistible read. Highly Recommended.	2001-12-13

Roberts' SPQR novels back in print. With the sixth novel `Nobody Loves a Centurion' now published, it gives a good excuse to go back and re-read this magnificent series of historical mysteries.<br /><br />In this second novel, the protagonist Decius Caecilius Metellus the Younger continues his rise through the Roman political system as the yearly quaestor in charge of the treasury-a low ranking, thankless and mundane job. Caius Julius Caesar is the pontifex maximus, Pompey is wielding his imperium in the near east, and Cicero is one of the consuls-the supreme magistrates of the Republic. In this post-Sulla era, Rome is fairly quiet but marred by the unexplained murders of several equites-the upper middle class businessmen/citizens that don't have the prestige of being patricians, but but the true holders of much of Rome's financial wealth.<br /><br />In his usual sideways manner, Decius Caecilius gets himself involved and appointed to investigate. What follows is a rather well told tale of intrigue and desire based upon the historical conspiracy of Lucius Sergius Catilina against the Republic. Steven Saylor covered some of the same material in his equally excellent novel `Catilina's Riddle'-but from a slightly different perspective. This key moment in Roman history was truly a political turning point that presaged the end of the Republic and the coming of the Imperators.<br /><br />Crassus, Pompey, Caesar and Catilina are brought to life in a way that history books can't do, and J.M. Roberts has created a most likable character in his Decius Caecilius. The extensive use of Roman titles and terminology is offset by the short glossary explaining key Latin terms as they were used in this era. A smart and fascinating novel with not so much mystery as history. Highly Recommended.	2001-12-12

This fifth novel finds Bak leaving behind his appointment as head of the Medjay police at the fortress of Buhen and instead finds him investigating the mysterious deaths occurring at the building site of the memorial temple for the divine Queen Maatkare Hatshepsut. Accompanied by his two youthful assistants Kasaya and Hori, bak tries to expose the \\"malign spirit\\" plaguing the site as a man with more human motivations-the theft of relics from plundered tombs.<br /><br />One of the amazing things that Haney accomplishes in these novels is bringing the people and places of 18th dynasty Egypt a gritty realism, while conveying that this ancient culture already has a magnificently old history filled with culture and traditions which were already being lost in time. At times the prose gets as dry as the Egyptian desert, but overall it is a wonderful read that leaves you with a renewed appreciation for ancient Egypt.	2001-12-12

And a `tie-in' here is not just a reuse of characters created in the original series-it literally ties in to episodes that span the entire life of the series, in ways that are enlightening, entertaining and sometimes surprising.<br /><br />'Invoking Darkness' picks up with the Shadow War raging, the Vorlon Kosh cut down on the B5 station, and the remaining techno-mages sequestered in their place of hiding. Seeds sown by Morden at the last techno-mage convocation several years previous have begun to come to fruition for the Shadows. Not only are Elizar and Razeel helping to wreak havoc wherever they can, some of the techno-mages at the hiding place now are beginning to think they should join the shadows as well. In an unexpected turn of events, Galen is given a mandate by the Circle to leave the hiding place and to locate and destroy the three people who threaten the techno-mages existence: Morden, Elizar, and Razeel.<br /><br />Unexpected revelations are made about Anna Sheridan in her role as shadow servant, the role of \\"the First One\\" Lorian, and the fate of Wierdan-the first techno-mage. This is a tale not only of revenge, redemption and good over evil-but a wonderful examination of the human condition through each characters motivations and subsequent actions. Filled with tension, suspense and adventure, 'Invoking Darkness' gets my highest recommendation.	2001-12-12

A work of history that reads like fiction, THE GLADIATOR not only gives a dramatic and vivid picture of Roman life--it re-creates the stories of Spartacus, Commodus, Caligula and others that have become legendary through their connection to the gladiatorial arena. It is an illuminating book that shows these warrior slaves as both popular heroes and reviled prisoners of the state. They led short, brutal lives and in many cases were more popular with the crowds of Rome than the Emperors who held the power of life or death over them.<br /><br />Alan Baker has done an excellent job in presenting fact and legend side by side. He has created a book of credible depth told with an ease that makes the material accessible to all. Scarrow does not succumb to the modern Christian interpretation of history written by the victors--instead showing that cultural context must be understood. Some of the content is a bit sensationalized, but for anyone interested in Roman history, this book is highly recommended.	2001-11-16

In 42 AD Claudius is Emperor, the Germans have been mostly subdued and Rome has the isle of Britain set as the next territory to be aquired. It has been nearly a century since Julius Caesar made his unsuccessful foray to subdue the Britons, and Claudius needs this success to assure his rule. Titus Flavius Sabinus Vespasian, as Augusta and legate of the Second Legion, is to play a major role in the conquering of this new province.<br /><br />Simon Scarrow does a wonderful job bringing history to life through the exploits of new recruit and optio Quintus Licinius Cato--and his centurion, Lucius Cornelius Macro. These two fictional characters weave a credible story by their interaction with fictionalized versions of Vitellius, Vespasian and his wife Flavia, and Narcissus--freedman, secretary and confidant of the Emperor Claudius.<br /><br />I look forward to reading further novels by this author as they make their way into American publication, and highly recommend this work of fiction for anyone with interest in this part of history.

For a single volume, this is an incredibly comprehensive overview of the current mainstream theories in a variety of fields. It is actually more fascinating than A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME, and I found it highly readable--although I do have a science background which creates a bit of a bias. And I did find myself returning to other texts for reference on several occassions.<br />The illustrations really do make this one of the most accessible texts on the areas covered, and the discussion on string theory is especially fascinating. In some ways, it is like reading a series of articles in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, so if you feel comfortable with that level of scientific complexity then this book should be a comfortable read. Highly Recommended.	2001-11-15

Ludlam pretty much defined his own genre when he began writing, 23 novels ago. I was surprised by how slick and &quot;packaged&quot; this novel felt, but it honestly was a great read. There is building suspense in multiple plotlines that keeps the reader's interest. The characterizations and dialog seem a bit thin, but they do the job and make this a fast and easy read--the equivalent of a James Bond type adventure. The scenes set in Zurich, Switzerland really pull you into the setting, and the world of multimillionaire Max Hartman and his investment banker son Ben are truly fascinating. Fun, action packed and satisfying.	2001-11-15

I was really drawn into the characters and plotline of the first novel in this series, and was left wanting to learn more about Hunter Hawk and his mysterious origins. This second novel did not disappoint in providing more adventure and intigue--and leaves you with a real surprise at the end, waiting for the next in the series. You really have to have a strong stomach for some of the wholesale slaughter in this book, and the 'suspension of disbelief' one must take in science fiction is tuly pushed to it's limits, but it is a fun and quick read. I look forward to the next in the series.	2001-11-15

Sean Williams and Shane Dix have proven themselves to be authors of note in creating charcters and a 'universe' of surprising complexity and interest. The mystery of Adoni Cane and the genetically enhanced clone warriors builds in tension through all 3 books, nearly a thousand pages, to come to a most disappointing conlusion. I refrained from writing a review for more than a month to try and approach this less emotionally. After all, I had invested considerable time and emotion in characters and plotlines that came to a much to abrupt conclusion. It felt as if the authors just ran out of creative energy and care for their creation, and decided to end it. I still recommend the trilogy, as it is filled with fine writing, excellent ideas and fascinating characterizations.	2001-11-07

The concept is that the ethical and altruistic Federation has a secret service equivalent to the Romulan Tal Shiar or the Cardassian Union's Obsidian Order. An amoral covert organization of espionage, sabotage and assassination designed to deal with dangers and problems that are not easily solved within Starfleet an Federation parameters of law and conduct.<br /><br />Personally I find the whole &quot;Section 31&quot; concept to be antithetical to the reasons I have enjoyed the various Star Trek incarnations over the years. Gene Rodenberry would probably be appalled... With that said, I must say that I enjoyed this ST: Voyager novel immensely, and the Section 31 influence was perhaps the lightest here of all the books in this series. It is especially enjoyable having a novel that so well reflects the characters as they were portrayed in the TV series, with Seven of Nine and Captain Janeway being particularly well developed. The authors are to be commended on a tale well told.	2001-11-07

Her brilliance as a surgeon appears to be of little benefit at Kervarzangia Two's FreeClinic, where humans are a despised minority. Cherijo grows as both a doctor and as a person as she faces medical emergencies in treating species and illnesses that seem unfathomable, including a 'plague' which puts the entire planet at risk.<br /><br />S. L. Viehl does an excellent job in creating a character that is both compassionate and fallable; a likable charcter that faces change and the unknown with bravery and very human emotion. Viehl's worldbuilding skills are excellent, and her panapoly of aliens is one of the finest I have ever encountered. I look forward to reading the continuing tales in this rapidly growing series of novels.	2001-11-07

Colin Dexter is a masterful writer who has done a magnificent job in developing the characters of Chief Inspector Morse and Sergeant Lewis. I have truly enjoyed watching them develop in his novels over the years and have marveled at the friendship that has developed in these characters of such opposite demeanor.<br /><br />In this most fascinating mystery, Morse faces his own mortality in some rather surprising ways while trying to resolve a murder that appears to have been a mistake. Blackmail, tabloid journalism and the secrets of Oxford dons all weave together in ways that ultimately reveal a devious but logical solution. One of the author's finest novels -- highly recommended.	2001-11-07

This novel makes use of Wilson's excellent plotting to tell the story of DNA theft, renegade scientific human breeding and genetic engineering in a most compelling way. One excellent feature is that Charles Wilson tells his stories without the heavy handed, opinionated bias that most authors use--he leaves you with thought provoking questions, and lets you draw your own conclusions. A highly recommended novel of scientific suspense.	2001-10-24

I started &quot;DREAMER&quot; yesterday, and could not sleep until I finished it at 3 am! Steven Harper certainly knows how to tell an engaging tale and keep the reader's interest from start to finish.<br /><br />Harper has created a new science fiction universe which shows incredible imagination and skill in world builing. His 'Silent Empire' is superb, both in it's concept and execution--a universe where Dreamers of numerous species communicate on a plane of existence entered by their thoughts. They can 'possess' the bodies of Silent slaves thousands of light years away, and are crucial in the running of the various galactic empires.<br /><br />The plot revolves around two major points: a Silent being of great strength that has been recently sensed within the Dream, one who can possess the non-Silent as well; and there is also a great change taking place in the Dream, where the Silent are losing control, and a great storm of change is coming.<br /><br />Told with great care and filled with fascinating characters, this is one of the best books I have read in a very long time.	2001-10-24

A strong plot filled with tension and mystery, well drawn characters that you can care about, and overall extremely entertaining. The science linking back to just what these creatures are, and why they act as they do is written like someone who is completely comfortable with both paleontology and oceanography. A real weekend pleaser.	2001-10-24

THE OTHER WIND is written with equal parts of strength, grace and delicacy; clarity of phrase forgoing any stylistic pretensions. I found myself frequently pausing to reflect on the language and the story, both subtle yet strong.<br /><br />One of the notable themes that run through this novel is that of bonds: Bonds between the living and the dead, bonds of duty, bonds of love, and bonds between the past and future. Perhaps it is the changing nature of these bonds that provide the most fuel for the story, in the interaction between familiar characters from the past, and the new that are the focus of the moment. I may make THE OTHER WIND sound too philosophical, but let me assure you that it is sure to be a pleasure simply as a fantasy story, whether you are familiar with the previous books or not.<br /><br />And if this novel is not enough, pick up the newly released collection TALES FROM EARTHSEA which has even more wonderful short stories from Ursula K. Le Guin.	2001-10-01

A few years ago I was fortunate enough to pick up a copy of Rutledge Etheridge's AGENT OF CHAOS, which was an amazingly good read. So when I saw this book, I bought it and am very pleased that I did. With a bit less than 200 pages, and primarily made up of two short episodes, it is a quick read, but Etheridge has created something very special with the characters. The writing is done in a smooth and confident manner--moving the plot along at a brisk pace. I am not fond of the &quot;Duelist&quot; culture of structured violence, nor was I pleased with the story coming to an abrupt halt, begging for a sequel, but it is a very well written and fascinating story.	2001-09-30

In the two decades since THE FOUNTAINS OF PARADISE was written, the idea of an 'elevator' into space has permeated the science fiction world completely, seen as merely a fact of things to come. In part, I believe it is because Arthur C. Clarke made such an excellent case for it in this novel which builds one up 36000 km (24,000 miles)--from Sri Lanka to geostationary orbit. It combines two of the authors most popular themes, technological evolution &amp; human quintessential development, with sparse prose and moving directness. At the time of it's original publication, it was announced to be the author's last novel, which happily is one of Clarke's predictions which did not come true! Very Highly Recommended.	2001-09-02

It is Arthur C. Clarke's most enduring tale and is &quot;one of the strongest tales of conceptual breakthrough in genre SF.&quot; (Peter Nichols, Encyclopedia of Science Fiction) It is a mesmerizing story of technology, nature, space travel, discovery, 'the future' and the true nature of cosmic perspective. Engaging and articulate, it brings a mystical intensity which has made it a classic, and made Sir Arthur C. Clarke a true grand master of science fiction.<br /><br />THE SANDS OF MARS, one of Clarke's earliest novels is a bit stiff in its prose, but is still as entertaining today as it was when it was first published in 1952. It is an optimistic tale of survival on Mars--in the very classic mode of human problems being resolved against a backdrop of scientific discovery.<br /><br />A special thanks should go to Warner Aspect SF division for putting such great works in a contemporary format--and bringing back some of the finest science fiction classics. Some of the other titles they have published in this new format include THE FOUNTAINS OF PARADISE, THE GHOST FROM THE GRAND BANKS and THE DEEP RANGE.	2001-09-02

THE GHOST FROM THE GRAND BANKS was written more than a decade ago, telling a tale of an attempt to raise the Titanic in the early 21st century. It was only a few years later that James Cameron's TITANIC caused enough stir in interest for the old ship's future fate that such attempts to raise the old tin pot now don't seem so outlandish at all. This novel, written in typical Clarkean style, is filled with science and technology fitted to a spare and efficient fromework of a plot. Diversions into the world of mathematics via the 'Mandelbrot set' makes for a fascinating counterpoint to the main story.<br /><br />In 1957, the year the Space Age began, ACC penned THE DEEP RANGE--about near-future undersea farming and exploration of Earth's &quot;inner space.&quot; The author's love of the sea and it's creatures was prominently shown in this evocative novel. In the decades since it was published, the world has undergone a true revolution in attitude toward marine mammals and their habitats. Whale song has been studied, protective covenants established to preserve endangered species, and exploration of the seas continues. A classic tale that sometimes rankles the contemporary mindset, but exposing all kinds of future possibilities.	2001-09-02

This edition serves the purpose well, and is only slightly more expensive than the &quot;Compact&quot; version in the Webster's New World editions--while having alot more content, and it is still in the mass market paperback size which is convenient to carry and travel with.<br />The English to Japanese translations has the English word in bold, then the Romanized Hepburn/Hebonshiki which is most commonly used, then the hiragana/katakana characters. The Japanes to English portion uses the Romanized version in bold, then the characters, then the American English translation. A nice clear format, but it is important to note that the Americanized English is used, so if you are used to the &quot;Queen's English&quot; it is a little confusing...	2001-08-18

Each novel in this series improves upon characterizations, plot lines, and overall suspense. In this installment, Mark Manning, the protagonist, has a much broader and more responsible role in both his personal relationship, his job, friends, and with his nephew Thad. The mystery plotline is stronger as well as Michael Craft incorporates red herrings and less obvious solutions than in some of his previous books. The title of the book was too big a give away to some of us who play &quot;Name games&quot; on a regular basis, but you still look forward to Mark Manning solving the crime. An enjoyable read, with only a few &quot;over the top&quot; characters.	2001-08-16
US	53060203	R3JU5BZEFFF80N	0441008356	824019804	Revelation Space	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Complex, compelling and intelligent.	This is a spectacular first novel that truly takes on the mysteries of 'life, the universe, and everything' in a manner that is compelling and fascinating to contemplate. I initially was confused by the variety of timelines and storylines, but the author does a fine job in tying things together not only for the plot, but in the speculations about the progress (or lack there of) of intelligent life in the universe.<br />The slow revelation of facts about the long deceased Amarantin culture on Resurgem is paralleled by political upheavals that in retrospect mirror some of what the Amarantin culture itself underwent. The intrigues and science taking place on the lighthugger spaceship &quot;Nostalgia for Infinity&quot; are worthy of a novel by themselves. But it is the complexity of the intertwined stories that truly make this a book of the highest caliber. Highly recommended for those interested in the &quot;Big Ideas&quot; of science fiction, rather than just action thrillers.	2001-08-16

It is one of those books that brings you back to your childhood if you are older, and is completely accessible by youger readers as well. And best of all, when you finish the book it makes you feel like you have just experienced something truly entertaining--yet profound.<br />The angst and horrors that can be found in &quot;Dreamworld,&quot; the amusement park of the future, only reveal themself in a place where &quot;dreams come true.&quot; A fascinating plot, not easy to summarize, but very much worth the read.

Thematically intriguing, I found many new perspectives on endangered species, a subject near and dear to my heart. Suzy McKee Charnas's &quot;Listening to Brahms&quot; was one of my favorite stories from the old OMNI Magazine, and the new original stories by Ian McDowell, Brian Stableford, Joe Haldeman and others are all works of exceptional quality. The inclusion of Avram Davidson's &quot;Now Let Us Sleep&quot; from 1957 gives a very short blast from the past which is quite memorable. Highly recommended.	2001-08-06

That is the question...<br />This anthology presents a fascinating group of tales which range from mild horror, to fantasy, to true science fiction. Whether it is the individuals ability to know your every thought, influence the outcome of events, or sense things beyond the range of normal human perceptions--it is their differences that make them candidates for &quot;The Mutant Files.&quot;<br />Sixteen Stories include: Alan Dean Foster's &quot;The Killing of Bad Bull&quot; about an Indian who can 'smell' electronic devices and procedes to use it for financial gain; Sophie Mason's &quot;The Great Deep&quot; which tells a tale of sealmen that live in the Irish Sea off the coast of Wales; and Karen Haber's &quot;Behind His Gates of Gold&quot; telling of a mutant future in Brazil where anti-mutant legislation has not been passed asit has in most of the rest of the world--and of Prospero Mephisto, and enigmatic estate owner and leading socialite with secrets to hide.<br />There is not a bad tale in the group, and I highly recommend this anthology.	2001-08-06

Where the first book in the series concentrates on the coming-of-age of Galen in settings that were almost entirely new to B5 fans, this novel weaves in one of the best episodes of the series, set on the station early in the tenure of Captain John Sheridan. By adding back-story and additional details, Jeanne Cavelos has created depth and character development that benefits both this novel, and the original TV episode! She even is able to weave in the rescue of Matthew Gideon, of the &quot;B5: Crusade&quot; series in a way that clarifies, enlightens and intrigues.<br /><br />As the Techno-mages prepare to leave the galaxy, rather than fight in the Shadow War, secrets are exposed, deceptions are played at numerous levels, and sacrifices are made. The personal losses of Galen are nearly overwhelming (both to the character and to the reader) and his motivations become almost a zombie-like search for Elizar, the renegade Techno-mage who has apparently teamed up with the Shadows, who killed Isabelle. Elric, Galen's teacher and mentor, makes sacrifices of his own and tries to balance his commitment to the Circle as well as his commitment to Galen.<br /><br />Highlights to further entice you: Anna Sheridan is present in her incarnation as the heart of a Shadow vessel, Mordden makes his appearance as the constant Shadow dupe, and Kosh keeps up the enigmatic Vorlon role as observer of the younger races. Truly this is a book that no Babylon 5 fan can pass by. Highly Recommended.	2001-07-15

STARHAWK starts off with a bang and keeps up a relentless pace moving forward. Filled with plot twists and characters that you can empathize with, it presents our galaxy some 5000 years in the future in a way that seems not so remote.<br /><br />Hawk Hunter, the archetypal hero/protagonist, would at first appear to be a fairly stock character in the world of science fiction, but he transcends this by himself being an enigma with a quest - something one often finds in fantasy tales instead. Uncertain of his origins, Hawk has knowledge and skills that make him a natural hero within the fourth galactic empire. Enough so that he is at one point favored by the emperor, empress, and both daughter and son.<br /><br />STARHAWK is action packed, page turning, great light reading that makes me glad there are writers out there still telling tales in the spirit of Heinlein, A. C. Clarke and A.E. van Vogt. I will be looking forward to future books in this series.	2001-07-12

Czerneda's A THOUSAND WORDS FOR STRANGER, I have looked forward to each of her new novels with their unique perspective and insight. BEHOLDER'S EYE was phenomenal as well and established Czerneda as one of the brightest new writers to come along in many years. IN THE COMPANY OF OTHERS continues to show the author's substantial talents through a tale of human galactic expansion and \\"first contact\\" of a most original type.<br /><br />The hefty tome of this latest novel is a bit intimidating at first, and I must admit that the first 200 pages were extremely challenging to read, and made for a slow start. Perhaps it was the author's desire to explain her well created universe in a bit too much detail, or perhaps it just needed one healthy edit by someone who wasn't afraid to cut text that was neither necessary for character development or for the plot to move forward.<br /><br />With that said, I must applaud Czerneda on creating some of the most \\"alien\\" of aliens in science fiction today. Her \\"Quill\\" are enigmas par excellence, and \\"first contact\\" becomes an event of intrigue and fascination. There is a hearty dose of cultural anthropology here told through a xeno-biological perspective, as well as a healthy dose of hard speculative science backing up every paragraph. What may be missing in \\"action\\" is certainly made up for in ideas. Ideas about the future in science, politics, ethics and human relations.<br /><br />IN THE COMPANY OF OTHERS is highly recommended, and I will continue to look forward to Czerneda's unique writing talents filling my shelves for years to come.	2001-07-12

The author has done a tremendous job in intertwining three related plots to generate an oeuvre of hefty proportions and considerable creativity. And it is such a pleasure to read a book that is written for the reader, not in anticipation of a screenplay.<br /><br />RED MOON not only uses the backdrop of the US-USSR space race as one point of departure, but also creates tension through the ongoing philosophical differences that remain between the two nations. The historical references to the program of the late 1960's are insightful, accurate and compelling. The plots are uncompromisingly driven by a \\"what-if?\\" factor that is added by speculations that the world was not aware of certain flights and missions by the Soviets. Revealing these cover-ups and conspiracies through the future lunar exploration timelines is a remarkably effective literary device, well handled by the author.<br /><br />The characters of astronaut Janet Luckman, planetary geologist Milo Jefferson, and central character, Cosmonaut Grigor Belinsky are well drawn and believable. The future setting of lunar exploration in search of Helium-3 is portrayed admirably, and the historical elements incorporated are enlightening and without extraneous embellishment.<br /><br />A gripping and passionate tale that is sure to please. Highly Recommended.	2001-05-26

Fast paced and funny, this charming vampire tale is a refreshing read. The author has quite a wonderful take on contemporary vampire fiction and makes a point of weaving a murder mystery into a genre that usually is all horror. Her characters are marvelously entertaining in their own right, but it is the fast moving plot that carries the reader through this romp-by-the-swamp in contemporary Louisiana. Even Anne Rice gets a bit of a poke from the author, and I hope she writes more books in this vein.	2001-05-19

Several have called this a mystery of what really happened to cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, but that is a plotline in this story that does not arrive until 2/3 of the way through the story... and is truly only a minor part of this techno-thriller. The history of the Russian space program is absolutely fascinating and dictates both the plot and setting. It is a wonderfully brisk read that kept me entertained and looking for further information in the area of the history of space exploration. Highly recommended.	2001-04-28

Being a fan of Lindsey Davis' series of historic mysteries of Marcus Didius Falco, and also having recently read &quot;Vespasian&quot; by Barbara Levick, I found this novel to be an acurate and entertaining portrayal of the long time relationship of Vespasian and Caenis. It is neither the rollicking, irreverant narrative of Falco, or the dry statement of historical footnotes in a textbook; &quot;Course of Honor&quot; combines the best of both in a tale that gives a wonderful perspective on the life of one of Rome's better emperors through the eyes of the woman who truly stood by his side.	2001-04-28

Jeanne Cavelos has written a truly literate and entertaining novel of the techno-mages that shows she is a talent to watch. Working from an outline of Michael Straczynski, Cavelos has fleshed out the history of the techno-mages as told through the eyes of Galen, best known from the Babylon 5 &quot;Crusade&quot; series. The apprenticeship and initiation themes are stock-in-trade for all fantasy books, but here is refreshingly told as a way of establishing the character and his motivations. Galen is shown as student, apprentice, adept and then accomplished techno-mage. A wonderful novel that makes you look forward to the remaining books in the trilogy.	2001-04-28

Lisa Goldstein is one of the finest storytellers of our generation, and &quot;Dark Cities Underground&quot; shows this in vivid detail. Who else do you know who can weave together the themes from favorite childrens books sucha as &quot;Alice in Wonderland,&quot; &quot;Peter Pan,&quot; &quot;The Wind in the Willows,&quot; and even &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to create an excursion through the archetypes that form the Dark Cities Underground? Add in enough Egyptian mystery via the tales surrounding Isis, Osiris and Set -- and you have yourself a potent little tale that is hard to forget.<br />If you like the works of James Blaylock or early Tim Powers, then this is one you should give a try. The characters are well developed, the themes are fascinating, and the book is thoroughly entertaining. Highly Recommended.	2001-03-06

Paul Levinson's first novel, &quot;The Silk Code,&quot; was absolutely wonderful, and I am glad to say that this new novel is satisfying in much the same manner. An amazing range of knowledge, from Quantum mechanics to Native American mythology, is combined in endlessly fascinating ways to tell a tale of mankinds first efforts at traveling to Alpha Centauri. The storyline twists and turns in ways that are most unexpected, and the cast of eccentrics both on and off the ship make for a fascinating study of the human condition. A thought provoking book of the highest caliber.	2001-03-06

P.C. Doherty is one of the most respected (and most prolific) writers of historical mysteries. He has a masterful talent for bringing accurate historical details to life for the 21st century reader--and creating memorable characters that you either love or hate. The plot here is rather thin, but the resolution is ultimately satisfying.<br /><br />If you are looking for a non-fiction reference to the historical period covered in this novel, you might want to see &quot;Hatchepsut: The Female Pharaoh&quot; by Joyce Tyldesley. It is a very accessible biography and analysis of this fascinating woman.	2001-02-06

It is packed with solid science, and the extrapolations of current theories in future practice. The plot is rather straight forward, but has enough twists and turns to keep your interest. The characters are well drawn and interesting as well, but it is the science surrounding the exploration of Jupiter that is in the forefront here.<br /><br />If you like science fiction that makes you stretch your brain cells a bit, this is an excellent choice. Not since Robert L. Forward's &quot;Saturn Rukh&quot; has planetary exploration been this fascinating. Highly Recommended.	2001-02-06

Charles Wilson has the knack for merging genres of fiction into imaginative tales that excite, entice and entertain. In his latest, DEEP SLEEP, there is a mixing of mystery and thriller into a tension filled novel set in the Deep South that the author so vividly brings to life. Detective Mark French is called in to investigate a most bizarre murder at the South Louisiana Sleep Disorders Institute. It appears that one guest has murdered another, but the lack of motive is complicated by the involvement of Boudron, an 'unfortunate' who lives in the nearby swamp where he hides his birth-defect, deformity-ridden body from the public at large. And what exactly is the staff and director of the Sleep Institute hiding from the police? The plot, like a good jambalaya, has a plethora of elements that only enhance by their coming together. Science, psychology, herbal medicine and even Voodoo become essential ingredients in this tasty novel.<br /><br />The resolution of the crime(s) is not merely a matter of serendipity. Wilson lays out a wonderful trail of logic that effectively shows how the resolution of the many mysteries comes about, in a highly suspenseful manner. As an added bonus, the last few pages leaves the reader with enough of a question in the air to wonder whether logic and science is enough to provide the answers needed. A highly recommended novel!	2001-01-25

Clarke has educated and enlightened multiple generations of readers with works that brought the future to us at an accessible, understandable level. Some of my favorites include Imperial Earth, The Fall of Moondust, and The Fountains of Paradise. And in this year, one must honor the classic &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot;<br /><br />Neil McAleer's biography of Sir Arthur C. Clarke is perhaps one of the best books to give a full understanding of this most versatile and visionary thinker of the twentieth century; but it is only through reading the non-fiction writings that one truly gets to know what a brilliant visionary that Arthur C. Clarke truly is. He has put out numerous papers, articles and books--but they generally have been out of print for many years--which is what makes this collection of essays so wonderful. Here is a logically organized anthology that brings together diverse areas of thought including science, science fiction, politics and more. It does not strive to be a complete collection, but more an essential sampler serving as a tribute to this most knowledgeable and witty intellect.<br /><br />If you have not had the joy of reading Arthur C. Clarke's non-fiction, this is a wonderful place to start. If you have not read any in the last decade, this is a nice rememberance. And if you grew up reading his fiction and non-fiction as I have, it makes for a wonderful tribute to a truly phenomenal man.<br /><br />Perhaps there is hope for the future of mankind?	2001-01-02

A fascinating trip through the halls of power of one Hong Kong family empire, and the modern Western woman who has married into it. Beth Connor navigates the treacherous currents of Hong Kong's business world, and the autocratic Chang family that she has become an essential part of. Set in the year of transition, when Hong Kong is being returned to China's rule, it is a most compelling drama told in the spirit of James Clavell's TAIPAN but with a more contemporary feel.<br /><br />Henry Luk has built upon his first novel, China Bride, bringing back characters who grow more complex as the series of plots develops. The swashbuckling Irish-American Beth Connor and Chang Wing Hing, the venerable patriarch of the Chang family, never become cariactures--as they might have in the hands of a less skilled (or knowledgeable) writer. In fact, it is the dynamic relationship between these two characters that moves the storyline along in a most satisfying manner.<br /><br />I look forward to more works of fiction by Henry Luk, and hope he continues this storyline into future books. As Hong Kong slowly throws off the last vestiges of British colonial rule, it is nice to know that there is an author there to chronicle the interaction between this capitalist territory and the communist government that now governs. Highly recommended.	2001-01-02

What more could you ask for in setting and plot? Staging a mystery among the ranks of Alexander the Great's troops, during the early years of his reign. It should be a sure fire success, especially for such an esteemed writer of historical fiction. But the drab Israelite Miriam, who is the sleuth in these tales, serves as a voice of criticism of a culture that the writer clearly doesn't understand.<br />I mean this in the fact that the 'history' is excellent, the plotting is well done, but the constant remarks deriding Greek culture and religion is simply ignorant. A shame.<br />Add to this the distraction that the reader is constantly assaulted with mispellings and errors in grammar every few pages, showing that some editor should have lost their job over this one. :)	2000-12-17

It is a mystery to me why promoters want to push that this book is more in the spirit of &quot;Shakespear in Love,&quot; when the only item it has in common is that Will Shakespeare is a character in it. If you want to compare it to movies, it is much more in the spirit of Jake Scott's 1999 directorial debut: &quot;Plunkett &amp; Macleane.&quot; Why? It is a cheeky, edgy rendition done with a contemporary conciousness.<br />The historical rendition of this &quot;Mystery of Errors&quot; is well done, the plot is solid and the characters convincing. As a Renaissance mystery, it has a nice flow, but beware that the mystery only begins to appear more than halfway through the book. The action picks up, and the solution at the end seems a bit rushed, but it is a nice debut to the mystery genre for prolific writer Simon Hawke. I only wish that the 'Afterword' had served as an introduction instead. Recommended.	2000-12-17

The index features and listing format makes it easy to find the movie you are looking for, and the large paperback format makes reading easier than in some of those small mass market paperback guides.

Saylor leads you along, and just when you think you know where all the pieces of the puzzle lie, he reveals 'the truth' in a way that truly is both surprising and logical.<br /><br />The history of the conflict at Massilia, brings to life the struggle of Julius Caesar to attain rule over the Roman world. The attention paid to detail in setting this story in the Greek colony-city-state on the edge of the Gaul &amp; Roman worlds, shows a broad spectrum of cultures at one of the most fascinating times in western classical history.<br /><br />As with all of Steven Saylor's works, this novel is highly recommended.	2000-11-30

It is wonderful to see that others have embraced this vision of the near future that is supported by the Living Universe Foundation ...and in fact turned it into the backdrop for this energetically entertaining novel.<br />Larry Niven and Steven Barnes have done a fine job incorporating a first rate mystery into a tale of human frailty and scientific possibilities.

As the author states, this is not meant to be a comprehensive volume. The field of ancient coins from non-classical cultures is so wide, that I think it is wonderful that someone took the time to assemble an overview that  helps the beginner to start recognizing types, and then points them in the  right direction. This is especially useful in a field where references for  very narrow segment of the coinage are hard to find, and most often very  expensive. I myself have invested in a book or two that sounded as if it  would carry my field of interest--only to leave me out in the cold, with a  very empty wallet!<br />I only wish that Wayne Sayles could continue this  series to cover coinage from India, Ceylon/Sri Lanka, and Asia as well.

Michael Ondaatje, of THE ENGLISH PATIENT fame, tells 'The Vulture' and  'Angulimala' with his usual brilliance. And Graeme MacQueen does a  wonderful job on a pair of tales, as well as providing a foreword for these  tales.

And the plethora of dysfunctional characters, both above  and below the sea, create a feeling of dystopia while laying a basis for  the story's conclusion.<br /><br />As a first novel for Peter Watts, this is an  exceptional accomplishment. Highly recommended.	2000-05-28

He brings a modern voice to characters of Ancient Rome, and has thoughtfully  analyzed the politics and history that might be obscure to many. This  seventh novel is a wonderful historic novel in it's own right, but is even  better for those who have read all the previous novels, from &quot;Roman  Blood&quot; to &quot;Murder on the Appian Way.&quot; Why? Well, I can't  give away the wonderful ending that Saylor has created here, but it helps  in knowing Gordianus' dedication to his family of manumitted slaves and the  turbulent politic's of his lifetime that create the backstory for this  novel. Highly Recemmended.	2000-05-28

A+	When this novel first slid across my desk, part of me was thrilled to have another David Gerrold novel to read, while part of me dreaded dealing with a story line wrapped around a dysfunctional family -- seen primarily from  the perspective of an adolescent. I am now extremely happy to tell you that  the story line reels you in, and moves along at a pace like a run away  train. The characters are believable and wonderfully real in their  strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />The &quot;world building&quot; that Gerrold  did in creating this novel is reminiscent of Arthur C. Clarke's  &quot;Fountains of Paradise&quot; but in the Western hemisphere of a  not-so-distant future. The balance of science to storyline is handled well,  and the twists of story along the way are entertaining, if not  exceptionally new. It is by no means a 'juvenile' novel, but instead should  appeal to a much wider readership. Highly recommended.	2000-05-28

What I found was this wonderful book that is even broader in scope, providing a fast  paced review of highlights in mankind's never ending task of collecting,  naming and growing plants. The author does not try to present only  sensationalized material, and doesn't try to be &quot;complete,&quot; but  instead gives a wonderful and highly readable overview of the field. Highly  recommended.	2000-05-23

It is always amazing to me that more people don't know the wonderful work that Trungpa did in bringing Buddhism to the West. He was a proponent of loving kindness who skillfully assisted thousands in understanding both the  basic precepts of Buddhism, and specific traditions of Tibetan Buddhism as  they are now practiced in both East and West.<br />This small format book is  a wealth of information -- more than the mere &quot;slogans&quot; which  lead each section. It is a careful revelation of principals and practices  one usese to train the mind, emphasizing how one can use compassion and  intelligence in dealing with everyday situations. A real gem of a book to  read and read again.	2000-05-21

This collection of writings by Thich Nhat Hanh spans over two decades of his reflections on nonviolence, peace, and reconciliation. The voice of a poet is mixed with the inner strength found in the works of Gandhi, Martin  Luther King, and the Dalai Lama. It is an important resource for anyone  working for social change, or searching for strength from within.<br />Of  Thich Nhat Hanh's more than sixty books, this one would be one of my picks  of his &quot;top ten,&quot; following closely behing PEACE IS EVERY STEP  and BEING PEACE.

The technical and artistic use of her prose is excellent -- but I just wish that so many of the themes didn't make me flinch. She brings a darkness to nearly every relationship  in the story, and keeps moving with her head held high.<br />Adultery, incest,  paracide, rape... you name it and you will find it here. It is an oddly  compelling story that disturbs, makes you think deeply, and then leaves you  wanting more.	2000-05-04

From the mind of one of today's most talented fantasists comes this tale of imagination and wonder. The plot may not be the most original, but the settings and characters show a brilliance of imagination not often seen.

Michael Craft has tied together several stories here that have equal emphasis. A tale of repressed desires, a straight forward mystery tale, and a condemnation of the religious right. The combination does not always work -- but at the conclusion I can say I am left wanting to read more.<br />Having  been trained as both a writer and an architect, I may be a bit biased in  favor of the characters, but the dialog is truly in need of help. It  alternated between florid prose and stiff barks... does anyone speak like  this?<br />As the start of a new series, I can say the protagonist is likable  without being syrupy sweet, and the action moves along at a good pace.  Enjoy the story as it is laid out and you will be left ready to read  another in the series.	2000-04-27

Having grown up with orchids, and been involved with conservation groups and the &quot;Orchid Community&quot; for more than two decades, I can attest that the lunacy and lust laid out by the author is not only accurate but understated as well. The CITES fiasco is finally being addressed, but  way to late to help the horticultural community that has suffered at the  laws created to help endangered animals. Perhaps this book will serve as a  wake up call, as well as being some of the best entertainment I have read  this year.<br />Eric Hansen's previous books are also classics to be read and  treasured, but his humor and maturity show themselves in full force with  this book. Highly recommended.	2000-04-27

If you have ever read any of Charles Wilson's books you know that he is a master storyteller, and a plotter of extreme talent. And when &quot;DONOR&quot; was released a few months ago, I thought it would be hard to beat. But Charles Wilson has done it once again in creating the page  turning suspense thriller &quot;GAME PLAN.&quot;<br />The characters are  wonderfully drawn, the storyline has you guessing until the last pages, and  there are no loose ends to frustrate even the most critical reader (Me!).  This is probably the finest fiction book I have read in a very, very long  time. Highly recommended.	2000-01-09

In 1971, Poul Anderson combined a number of his stories of Steve (the werewolf husband) and Virginia (a witch of great strength and beauty) into a novel which is unique in that it is as powerful and relevant today as it  was 30 years ago. In fact, isnt there a similar team on Buffy, The Vampire  Slayer?<br />The adventures of this dynamic duo are exciting and fun, while  Poul Anderson expounds wonderfully humorous parodies of modern society in  the alternate reality in which the novel is set. The Orb edition is a  wonderful way to keep this book around and share with your friends. Highly  recommended.	1999-11-18

I was happily surprised at the high level of hard science incorporated into this novel. The descriptions of the lunar base and NASA operations are well researched, and spoken with a voice of authority. The plot and  characters are tightly woven into a seamless and credible whole. The story  moves along briskly and asks the reader to explore myths in search of the  underlying science-just as the characters do the same. Not everything is  laid out with pat explanations, instead the answers lie within the  collective theories presented by the individual participants. An  intelligent and entertaining read. Highly Recommended.	1999-11-03

I thoroughly enjoyed this book, mostly because it doesn't take itself too seriously. For anyone familiar with the first two books in this series, or Pohl's numerous novels of the Heechee, these aren't \\"hard\\" science  fiction-but rather stories with entertaining plots and speculation. The  writing is reminiscent of Spider Robinson's early work and uses humor and  bizarre characters to make the reader smile, and think. Recommended light  reading.	1999-11-03

Something is twisted in Biloxi, Mississippi, and it's not just the politicians.<br /><br />DONOR is a spectacular scientific thriller filled with  suspense, mystery and intrigue.  Charles Wilson's well researched and  plausible plot takes off like a bullet--then twists and turns its way to a  finale that is quite stunning. He keeps the reader entertained from start  to finish with subplots and characters that are often bizarre, yet still  believable.<br /><br />The character of Dr. Michael Sims, in particular, moves  easily between the ER of Biloxi General Hospital, his home on a Gulfstar  trawler, playing detective sidekick to lawyer Shannon Donnelly, and visits  to the nefarious Waverly Research Center. His being manipulated into  running to fill the shoes of the recently deceased Congressman Donnelly  seems a most natural development that proves crucial to tying together the  many plotlines.<br /><br />If you like Robin Cook, Stephen King and John  Grisham--you can get the best of all genre's in Charles Wilson's latest!  Highly Recommended.	1999-10-24

This novel successfully crosses genres, and is filled with drama, mystery, romance &amp; intrigue. The science fictional elements come into play only late in the story yet are integral in making all the various story lines  come together. The use of astrology throughout the book is represented in  terms and language that are completely accessible to the layman, yet are  done with the thoroughness of one who is an expert in the field. The debate  between science versus astrology is approached through the protagonist's  personal relationship as well as her credibility to the public at large.  And Barbara Shafferman is likely to expand a few minds along the way. This  is a &quot;must read&quot; for all and is a fine first novel for the  author. Highly Recommended.	1999-08-16

It is wonderful that Tor has released his late-80's trilogy &quot;Dawn for a Distant Earth&quot;,  &quot;The Silent Warrior&quot; and &quot;In Endless Twilight&quot; as this  newly formed compendium, and re-reading the novels has created an even  deeper appreciation of both Modesitt's writing talents and the plot lines  of all three novels, which seemed a bit disparate on first reading. It is  &quot;space opera&quot; in the best sense of the word, and deals with Earth  as an eco-disaster in a far flung Imperial Empire, and the books are  definitely a bit testosterone heavy on the &quot;hairy-chested&quot; sf  writers scale, but it works so well for Modesitt that you find yourself  wrapped up in the adventure.<br />If you like David Feintuch's  &quot;Seafort&quot; chronicles or the tales of Miles Vorkosigan in Lois  McMaster Bujold's works, then this set of stories is sure to appeal to you.  In fact, there are bits that ring of Heinlein's &quot;Starship  Troopers&quot; and Joe Haldeman's &quot;Forever War&quot; as well. It is  far future military sci-fi, but with a much more character based  perspective than many in the genre-and definitely worth the read. Highly  recommended.	1999-06-23

District Marshall Ty Merrick, afflicted with lycanthropy, and her partner LaRue return in this fourth book of 21st century gone awry. It is filled with lots of mixed metaphors, strange plotlines, and everything that  normally would make a reader cringe--but Denise Vitola brings it all  together in a dark, disturbing, and oddly humorous tale that leaves you  wanting more. The book stands alone very well, but you would be missing all  the fun and adventures that started in QUANTUM MOON, OPALITE MOON, and  MANJINN MOON.	1999-06-13

This is quite a story--wrapped in layers of intrigue, politics and science--and told in a voice that makes even the most preposterous sound reasonable, and then like fact rather than fiction. The author goes to  great lengths to draw the reader in, and is successful in creating  something that is entertaining and thought provoking.<br />If you like the  works of Stanislaw Lem or John Varley, then Champetier is an author you  definitely should try. Not because this tale is derivative of their work in  any way, but because the mental jumps he takes and plot twists are as  intricate and finely wrought. Highly Recommended.	1999-05-30

George Turner was a superb writer, and this novel brings together many themes explored in his earlier novels. The future as distopia, the power of the mind, the bleakness of humanity and it's reactionary procession through  time.<br />As dark as it all sounds, it really is quite illuminating to see  the author's vision, and as a tale showing a possible future without  shoving cautionary rhetoric down the readers gullet. It *is* a remade  &quot;Brave New World&quot;--updated for the new century, and told with the  voice of an aging writer who has seen worlds of change in his lifetime.  There is a lot more here than is first exposed, and put's this in the  &quot;thoughtful&quot; school of science fiction--possibly a bit heavy for  some. Entertaining as well as enlightening, and highly recommended.	1999-05-30

THE BURNING PLAIN is his best mystery to date and shows both the development of the writer and the story's protagonist. A beautiful piece of work that is highly  entertaining, while keeping you well grounded in some of the grittier sides  of life. Hollywood scandal has rarely been treated better, with bits of  &quot;noir&quot; and &quot;camp&quot; added in just the right proportion.  Highly recommended.	1999-05-08

His collection of short  stories, &quot;Apostophes &amp; Apocalypses&quot; (Dec 98) was also  superb.<br />So what happened? This novel contains one of the most overworked  themes, chopped up storylines and only glimpses of his usual brilliance.  Maybe it could be hacked together as a &quot;Nazi's in Space&quot; b-grade  movie for Hollywood--but even that would take some doing.<br />If you are a  die-hard Barnes fan, you may find some satisfaction here. I'm sorry to say  that I didn't.	1999-05-04

His characters, plot and science may each be picked  apart--but when Robinson combines them--he creates something that is much  bigger than the individual parts.<br />It is now rare that a novel keeps me up  all night reading just for the pure enjoyment of it, but WAITING definitely  did.

I generally don't like &quot;child-themed&quot; science fiction so had left this one on my reading stack for a while. When I finally did get into the first few chapters, I  found out how my preconceptions from the book's title, and the blurb on the  back cover were totally off base.<br />The very depth of mathematics and  biology that are explored, within the context of a most fascinating story,  are both mind expanding and enlightening. There is quite a bit more here  than first meets the eye. The plotting and storyline combined with the hard  science make this a most memorable and worth while novel. Highly  Recommended.	1999-03-29

Taking place in the setting of the author's first novel, DARK WATER'S EMBRACE, but a century or so later, this is simply one of the best novels I have read in a long time. Stephen Leigh has a unique way of weaving a tale  from the threads of multiple perspectives and timelines--creating a  tapestry that is both beautiful and meaningful. If you are fond of the work  of Ursala K LeGuin, you will find much satisfation here.<br />Although the  novel stands on it's own as a fascinating story, you will definitely be  missing an opportunity if you don't go back and read DARK WATER'S EMBRACE  as well.

After reading (and very much enjoying) this author's book &quot;Inhuman Beings&quot;, I had to go out and find more of his writings. This story, the prequel to his current &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, had me smiling and  reading with a sense of glee. The story may be one we've heard before, but  never quite told with the hero (anti-hero?) having such a unique  perspective.

It is nice to have a  mystery that tugs the heartstrings a bit without trying to  &quot;preach.&quot; (Sorry, pun intended)<br />I haven't read the author's two  previous mysteries, but you can bet I'll be searching them out after  reading this one.

Norton has consistently produced such good fantasy, that it is no surprise that SCENT OF MAGIC once again shows her to be the top in her field. There is a lot more here than first appears on the surface, and the language is a  bit less straightforward than in many of Norton's earlier works, but it is  a nice escape to a world filled with court intrigue, royal romance and  black magic, too. It will especially appeal to fans of Norton's &quot;Witch  World series&quot; and is highly recommended.	1998-11-14

The subject matter covered by Thich Nhat Hanh is condensed down from his many superb books, lectures, and audiotapes in this one hour &quot;interview&quot; with Michael Toms. Unfortunately, a great deal of  this tape was recorded several years ago -- outdoors, under less than ideal  conditions. Hanh's quiet voice is often lost in background noise, which is  a shame since his message is so enlightening (no pun intended). Try any of  Thich Nhat Hanh's PRESENT MOMENT audio series, TOUCHING PEACE, or  MINDFULLNESS MEDITATION instead and you will be much happier.	1998-11-14

Pat Cadigan has once again come up with a well paced journey through near-future cyberspace that is packed with human emotion, bizarre comparisons of artificial reality versus the &quot;real&quot; world, and  elements of a police procedural, as well. It is a fascinating read, even  though some of the witticisms went right over my head! The Zen atmosphere  and Japanese myth allusions were handled well and make this novel a  &quot;must have.&quot; Highly Recommended.	1998-11-14

It comes complete with beach bunnies, cars, drugs, and an up and coming band circa 1967. There are monsters too  -- but it is hard to tell them apart from the movie moguls.<br />This is  Kihn's third novel, and each get's stranger but is good for a fast moving  laugh with a few chills along the way.

The stories are filled with wit,  humor and intelligence and bring together writers you never thought you  would see in the same volume. P.G. Wodehouse and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. with  Thomas Disch, Angela Carter, and Terry Pratchett! Amazing and wonderful.  Highly recommended.	1998-11-12

He proves himself again in this 22nd century science fiction tale of mankinds  fate after a century or two of nanotechnology and biotechnology being  driving sociological and monetary components of society. Artificial  (virtual) reality and computer interfacing are de rigeur, and there are  plots within plots, and conspiracies galore.<br />The plot is nicely  developed, but the conspiracies get a bit thick and hard to follow.  Unfortunately the themes of immortality and *emortality* are discussed ad  nauseum and leave the storyline a bit flat.<br />Overall a very good read, but  I'd advise you supplement your reading of this novel with James Halperin's  &quot;The First Immortal&quot;, which discusses similar issues through it's  storyline.	1998-11-12

If you missed Julie Czerneda's debut novel A THOUSAND WORDS FOR STRANGER,  you missed a grand tale and should remedy the situation immediately! But  don't let it delay you from reading BEHOLDER'S EYE, which offers new  perspective and point of view in a universe far in humankind's  future.<br />This is a story of first contact, and extended unobserved  contact, but told from the &quot;alien's&quot; point of view. It is a grand  adventure, in the classic science fiction sense, filled with page turning  excitement and written with a thoroughly modern sensibility. From the first  few pages, the reader is captured by both the plot and the characters, and  the developing friendship between the protagonists is both poignant and  fascinating to watch develop.<br />There is obsession and passion here as  well. Esen-alit-Quar is not your classical hero, but Captain Kearn is a  &quot;Captain Ahab&quot; of classic proportion. And most of all it is a  wonderfully told tale that will keep you entertained from beginning to end.  Highly Recommended!	1998-10-12

If you have read any of Varley's previous works, it will come as no  surprise that his consistent mastery of storytelling has once again  produced an odd and unusual tale of superb analogy and complexity. A  sweeping tale that reveals a unique character to depths that are amazingly  perceptive and revealing of the human condition.<br />Returning to his Eight  Worlds universe, roughly 500 years in the future, the author creates a  setting where all the universe (or at least solar system) is a stage, and  Sparky Valentine, anti-hero and itinerant thespian, plies his trade just  one step ahead of the law. It is a funny story, filled with pithy humour,  double entendres and references that theatre afficiandos will relish. But  fear not, at it's heart it is still science fiction in Varley's unique and  brilliant voice. Highly recommended.	1998-09-29

The extremely imaginative Matt Ruff has created a near  future that is familiar, yet different enough to be disturbing, and  definitely revealing of human depths not often explored in science fiction.  The authors style and voice take a bit of getting used to, but are highly  imaginative and do a good job of transporting the reader to another time  and place. Highly recommended for those looking for a bit of a challenge  and humor in their science fiction.	1998-08-24

It is very topical in addressing the subjects of politics,  radical conservationists and scientific technology all with a bit of ironic  skepticism.<br />Sometimes the plot borders on the melodramatic, but the solid  characters and plotline keep the reader moving through a series of  highpoints and a most satisfying conclusion.

It is a fascinating thriller filled with the best elements of  mystery, horror and action-adventure -- making it a book with very wide  appeal. The historic basis of the book is a fascinating tale in itself, but  was never quite this colorful (or gory, or melodramatic!).<br />Highly  entertaining and sure to give you an exciting adventure that you will  remember for a long time to come.	1998-08-24

The author's intent was  magnificent, but revealed too much personal ego for what I understand a Zen  master to be.	1998-08-24

A little like reading William Burroughs as the author challenges the reader to understand subtle sub-texts and a profusion of multi-ethnic symbols and references. I can understand that those unfamiliar with Tibetan Buddhism, Japanese Zen, Philip K. Dick and William Gibson may be left with the impression of a superficial cyberpunk thriller, but there is much more depth, humor and interest than first meets the eye. Highly Recommended.	1998-08-08

Sean McMullen may be one of the finest and most original SF authors to come along in the last decade. Well known in his native Australia, but often lost in the profusion of novels published in the US and Britain, he has a unique voice that was brilliantly expressed in his &quot;medieval cyberpunk&quot; novel VOICES IN THE LIGHT, and takes on an even more fascinating tone in THE CENTURION'S EMPIRE.<br />History takes on a very personal perspective through the eyes of the protagonist - Vitellan. He is not immortal, but fate has curiously given him an opportunity (in the form of a stolen chemical concoction) to freeze himself in suspended animation and be reanimated at a later date. At first, he is only frozen for a few years at a time -- wreaking a terrible fate on a women (and indirectly her family) who spurned his love. Later the centuries pass quicker and give us a very intimate look at romance and glory, chivalry and human frailty. Vitellan's awakening in the mid 21st c! entury is especially fascinating and suspenseful when a deadly enemy from the 14th century is found to be very much alive--and closing in.<br />A Superb novel, well written, entertaining and enlightening. Highly Recommended. [EAG]	1998-08-08

The Samuelson produced movie was superb, and here the novel is able to add a different level of depth by interspersing quotes and pieces of poetry by Wilde throughout the story line.<br />Granted, the story is not as complete as a full biography (Richard Ellman's is particularly thorough -- if somewhat dry) but it is told with such wit, humor and tragedy as to providing a most enchanting diversion. Highly Recommended, especially to those who are looking for good entertainment rather than mere scholarly facts and literary commentary.	1998-06-28

The theme of Masks -- both those that hide and those that reveal -- is subtley woven through a labarynth of individual struggles and stories of brilliant depth, and subtle humor.

Flynn once again wraps the reader in multiple storylines revolving around one woman's obsessive desire to protect Earth from potential killer asteroid impacts, while getting mankind back into space through corporate means rather than government subsidy. The plots are all fairly straight forward and well told, but the obsessiveness of 90% of the characters in this testosterone laden tale creates a bleak picture of mankind. All the men seem to be cheating on their wives, everyone carries around hidden agendas and obsessions with either their own self importance or their hatred of others.<br />Still, Flynn's vision and strong voice do make this a book worth spending some time with. The U.S. space program, educational institutes and corporate America could learn valuable lessons from his masterful speculations.	1998-06-16

Jon Hundred is a cyborg who has gained his physical freedom, yet whose mind remains a prisoner from a former life he cannot remember. His relationships with the humans, aliens and a very special artificial intelligence on an outpost at the edge of the galaxy create a fascinating tale of the struggles that each undergoes to gain freedom.<br />Highly recommended.	1998-06-16

Sawyer has created a mind-bending work of near future fiction that combines the search for meaning in alien signals with the search into the human condition and the collective subconscious. It is a positive, uplifting story that gives hope for humanity in Sawyer's unique voice. The scientific aspects of the tale are so convincingly expressed that the plot moves along quickly and provides for a most fascinating read.<br />Sawyer has a fascinating way of weaving elements from popular culture (references to Monty Python, Khan of Star Trek fame, etc...) to liven up serious subjects and demonstrate aspects of psychology, theoretical computer science, complex mathematical constructs (tesseracts and folded hypercubes). I found myself seeing lessons to be learned or fascinating revelations in every chapter -- whether they be of the connection between Dali's paintings and complex mathematics -- or the work of Alan Turing, Jung or so many others. Truly this is a novel not to be missed.	1998-06-16

And Tristan is a pawn in a game between warring corporate city-states, with his only goal being &quot;Selfhood&quot; which would allow him citizenship and a permanent form.<br />The storyline comes off as a &quot;Blade Runner&quot; for the new millenium, filled with lawless, surreal cults and underground organizations standing out against the corporate city states that war for the ultimate monopoly of governing all of the planet. Plots are interwoven with counterplots creating espionage and conspiracies galore; A mythic figure named Okasan transforms from saviour to &quot;mother&quot; to evil and back; Tristan becomes both pawn and player in a game that keeps expanding with every page.<br />Well written, fast paced and filled with moral issues that confront us with issues about humanity.

Iron Shadows makes forays into the darkly mystical world of cults &amp; sexual magic, while maintaining a James Bondian plotline and reaching deep into the frailties of human interactions. The erotic tension and gripping issues make this a hard book to put down. My only amazement is that in all the explorations of human sexuality -- the only character that crosses over the standard straight stereotypes is the &quot;evil&quot; villain. Trite, but it doesn't destroy the quality of the remainder of the novel. Highly Recommended.	1998-04-13

What more can you ask from such a superb piece of speculative fiction? Michael Kanaly has created a well crafted story that takes you from the micoscopic microcosm of a virus, to the galactic scale (and time line) spanning our universe. A fascinating set of speculations on living intelligence, the origins of species, and evolution that will keep you entranced from the opening paragraphs until the final page. A most satisfying read that asks for a minor amount of suspension of belief -- but returns and rewards with a brilliant abundance of ideas. Highly Recommended.	1998-03-01

The handling of multiple storylines is deftly handled, and the thought provoking issues raised make this story one of the best reads in a long time. Evolution, gender, society and survial are explored in parallel but intertwining stories -- one human, one alien. Highly Recommended.	1998-03-01

Sawyer has created some fascinating science fiction over the years and ILLEGAL ALIEN is some of his best writing to date. The science fiction aspects are overshadowed by courtroom procedures and random (but fun) pokes at the US judicial system -- and yet they are at the very core of the mystery being played out. One of the best aspects of Sawyer's books to date is using the &quot;alien&quot; to expose the human condition -- and show us how our society is as bizarre as any alien society could be. That is shown here in profound and sometimes humorous ways that can be read between the lines of the story. An enjoyable read, sometimes contradictory, yet still worthy of note.

The story is certainly a page turner, and the plot carries you along on a wonderous journey into a seemingly plausible 21st century setting. Greg Egan handled &quot;mankind transferring to a microchip&quot; much more in depth (and convincingly)in Permutaion City, however Danvers makes it more accessible to the general public -- rather than only to readers willing to learn and expand their scientific knowledge along the way. Science fiction fans will recognize alot of familiar territory here, and yet will find something new to explore on each page in Dennis Danver's excellent writing style. Recommended.	1998-01-10

Haldeman weaves a set of future events into a web of intrigue that leaves the reader with resounding questions on levels from the very personal -- to the cosmic.

Against the space station backdrop of HOME (High Orbital Manufacturing Enterprise), several storylines are pursued providing a philosophical commentary on &quot;engineered society&quot; as Utopia, Ecotopia and Dystopia.<br />This is a fine first novel from a writer well known for his short fiction. Social science, theology, bioengineering and artificial intelligence are mixed in varying proportions that are a bit heavy on philosophy, but without detracting from the scientific extrapolations. There is a Gibsonesque techno-shamanistic feel that prevails, and a political correctness of mixed cultures, but an amazing lack of diversities in relationships in this environment of potential social experimentation and advancement.	1997-10-18

McIntyre has once again spread her wings and flown with a novel that is unlike any other I have read. It seamlessly weaves historic fantasy, legend, and gothic influences into 17th century reality with a deft touch and lyrical telling. Simply one of the best novels I have read in a very long time.<br />Marie-Jos&egrave;phe's bond with the  creature, and coming to understand the sea woman's eerily beautiful singing language, brings realization that there is a heart and soul not so far from human. Marie-Jos&egrave;phe finds that her views on the creature's &quot;humanity&quot;, her budding love for the king's advisor, dwarf and atheist Count Lucien - are bringing her into conflict with the Pope, Louis's courtiers, her brother and the very Sun King himself. This is the very heart of the story and it is beautifully told, questioning the perceptions and convictions of the characters populating the story and the reader alike. Sub-plots that truly bring the 17th century to life include: Marie- Jos&egrave;phe being the math tutor of the young genius composer Domenico Scarlatti; the Sun King's protection of his married brother whose male lover (The Chevalier de Lorraine) is the epitome of indiscretion and randiness; and the power struggle between Louis and his visiting cousin Pope Innocent	1997-08-24

William Hartmann's books on Astronomy have been a source of great inspiration and education; this novel does the same while adding good solid entertainment. Hartmann continues in the &quot;plausible extrapolation&quot; mode of SF and includes enough mystery, conspiracy and excellent characterizations to keep the reader entertained.<br /> With all the interest in  Mars that has been generated by the success of the Sojourner/Pathfinder mission, this novel provides a good fix for those who like to get their science education within the bounds of an imaginative look into the mid twenty first century.

Aptly sub-titled &quot;A Metaphysical Novel of Murder&quot;, this was possibly one of the most disturbing, and most fascinating books I have read in the past few months. The subject matter was personally repugnant, but I couldn't put the book down. It is a mix of storylines from Andrew Vaachs and James Morrow; hard to categorize and reveling in it's own individuality. The multiple layering of stories of &quot;the hunt&quot; and the grand experiment of allowing souls to take corporeal form in mankind allows for parody and pasquinade of great complexity -- letting the reader find their own interpretations and meaning within the &quot;Thoughts of God.&quot; An incredibly good book that will give you plenty to ponder upon	1997-06-24

This novel is a wonderful debut for Gardner and shows tremendous skill in a tale well told and presenting ideas of grandiose speculation. There have been plenty of tales told from the &quot;outsider's&quot; perspective, but none quite like this -- and there are all kinds of social parallels that reflect on our society today.

I know there is an excellent science fiction tale lying somewhere deep at the core of this novel, but it is really so hard to wade through the piles of sexual dramatics. And it doesn't matter if it is straight, gay, multi-sex or a-sexual -- it just bogs down the storyline to the point of excess. There are good scientific extrapolations, interesting conflicts and some interesting philosophizing, but the tale felt as if it couldn't decide what it really wanted to tell the reader. Stylistically interesting; a story of great promise, but the execution just left me a little cold. Recommended, but be warned it's a challenging read	1997-06-24

Butler is a novelist, and her short fiction is sparse in quantity but incredibly generous in it's quality. As in her novels, she has this ability to take you deep down into the dark depths of the soul, and show you things both strange and fantastic. Concepts and torments of everyday existence wrench your emotions and make you think, then re-examine, then ponder the very substance of what makes one human....<br /><br />The eerie novella &quot;Bloodchild&quot; was first published in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine in 1984, and it grips you with fascination whether this is the first time you have read it, or the fifth. Butler has described this as her &quot;pregnant man story&quot;, but it is far more than that. Exceptionally well wrought and filled with wonder and amazement, it won her the Nebula and Hugo Awards for the stark portrayal of what it is like to be a human valued chiefly for your reproductive capacity. Only this time, the child is not human, and the &quot;parent&quot; keeps mankind as a much beloved but still unequal partner.....<br /><br />The rest of the fiction in this collection is of the same superb quality and each piece has an afterword that brings into perspective Butler's thoughts and inspirations. There is a bonus in two autobiographical pieces at the end of the collection on what she calls &quot;the art, the craft, and the business of writing.&quot; Whether you are a reader, or a writer, these pieces should not be missed....<br />The stories are as revealing about the reader as they are about the writer; they expose your own prejudices, emotions and motivations-as those of the protagonist are revealed in the writing on the page	1997-06-11

In fact, there are few writer's who could pull off such an audacious feat, then proceed to unleash some real emotional thrills and scientific mind benders to contemplate.<br /><br /> Who are these faceless attackers? And why are they so bent on mankind's destruction?<br /><br />This novel keeps you guessing, and will keep you thinking long after reading it. The whole notion of alien &quot;rules&quot; and racial prejudice in the intergalactic neighborhood is a bit much for the mind to chew. Then add a dash of Pellegrino and Zebrowski's potent brew of scientific extrapolations of life in the not so distant future, fold in a couple of cast of characters that you are afraid to care for (knowing what fate must await them), and garnish liberally with ethical and moral accoutrements [Jurassic Park, step aside.

Le Guin's classic novel of the near future was originally penned; a classic science fiction tale that is quite simply, a masterpiece.<br /><br />Avon Books has re-issued a new trade paperback format of the book, bringing this imaginative fable of power--both uncontrolled and uncontrollable--to a whole new generation of readers. And if you happened to see the WNET movie adaptation done in 1980, please read (or re-read) the book; as with most book to movie translations, the movie was good--but the book is just so much better!<br /><br />THE LATHE OF HEAVEN is the story of George Orr--a man whose dreams become reality, for better or worse. Against his will, Orr is incarcerated, then sent for psychiatric care to treat his &quot;delusions&quot;. After a few experimental sessions, Dr. Haber, Orr's psychiatrist, realizes what is going on and decides to start tinkering with the real world...to make it better--with devastating ramifications.<br /><br />Like Philip K. Dick at his best, Le Guin truly gets the reader into the inner machinations of the protagonist's head--while taking sly social sideswipes at such matters as geopolitics, race, socialized medicine, and the patient/shrink relationship. And there is a reason that Le Guin has often been referred to as a &quot;writer's writer&quot;. Her prose is artfully wrought with vivid imagery in an inimitable style which conveys more in a few sentences than others tell in pages.<br /><br />It is an allegorical tale in which a &quot;miracle worker&quot; (George Orr) comes under the control of someone wanting to play &quot;master of the universe&quot; (Dr. Haber). It is a dark vision and a warning--a fable of power both uncontrolled and uncontrollable--a truly prescient and startling view of humanity, and the consequences of God-playing. As usual, a brilliant novel from Le Guin, who explores many profound possibilities within the tight story; it is quite simply, a masterpiece.<br /><br />There have been so many works analyzing Ursula K. Le Guin's works since she vaulted to the vanguard of science fiction since the publication of her first novel in 1966--but the best way to know her work is by reading it. And if you have only read her Hainish or Earthsea novels, you are in for a pleasant change of venueworks analyzing Ursula K.

Haldeman exhibits a wide span of points of view, settings and themes--each written with a forthright clarity and inspired sense of imagination. &quot;Feedback&quot; begins the collection; an erotic and ultimately uplifting modern fable of inner scars and metamorphosis told by the gay protagonist who electronically links with clients to produce original works of art. Haldeman uses marvelous foreshadowing in  &quot;Passages&quot;, telling an edgy account of an intergalactic poacher's rite of passage.

In the Jupiter Novels, Tor Books has good intentions and bold goals of presenting a new line of original novels featuring all the virtues of classic science fiction--fast adventure, colorful characters, rigorous scientific accuracy, and thought-provoking ideas. The first Jupiter Novel, HIGHER EDUCATION by Charles Sheffield and Jerry Pournelle, was a predictable and not very engaging novel for young readers (ie: no sex) that fell short of the series' goals. It read more like a piece of propaganda arts from the far right wing (ie: social welfare undermines personal initiative), and if the story is allegedly a satire on the Education process, I found no humor and the message was lost. Frankly, it left me cold.<br /><br />Sheffield has much improved in sticking to the classic science fiction &quot;feel&quot; in THE BILLION DOLLAR BOY--which is a bit like a cross between Catcher in the Rye and an episode of the 60's TV classic &quot;Lost in Space&quot;. Shelby Cheever V is one of the richest young men of the 22nd century when a careless mistake finds himself on a mining ship 27 light years from Earth. [Hoo boy, what a premise to start with] Cheever finds himself having to rely on his own wits, working his passage off while learning a lot about what it is to be human. His trials and tribulations are filled with action and emotion; knowledge is gained in both his character and mind. He even slims down from the fat, spoiled, rich kid to a muscled, brainy and appreciative young adult. [reserving a rude comment here--I'll let my own sarcasm remain silent]<br /><br />The plot is entertaining despite its predictability--and lack of characters of true depth. The hard science is delivered in a no nonsense manner--no bug eyed monsters, &quot;rubber science&quot; or anything without plausible basis in today's known sciences. However, there are a few social leaps that one must buy into (like Earth being overrun by starving hordes of the poor, and ruled by an extremely minute group of rich elite) that may be a bit hard to stomach.

Anthologies are often difficult to review because of the diversity of voices, but if the reader approaches this collection as a buffet (from which one may pick and choose) rather than a 12 course meal, there will be more than one can consume at one sitting.<br />Classic stories by Robert Silverberg and Samuel R. Delany have been intermixed with more recent works by Neil Gaiman, Joyce Carol Oates, Elizabeth Hand, and 17 more of today's leading writers. Off Limits includes provocative tales of close encounters -- love, sex and life --  and plays with your perceptions of what is truly alien. One piece of advice: skip reading the Foreward by Silverberg and the Introduction by Datlow as they unfairly offer judgements of what the reader will find between the book covers and tainted my desire to read further. I found much more depth and content to contemplate than Datlow and Silverberg gave the author's credit for	1997-04-06

Gil Sivart, the protagonist in The Digital Effect, is a sensitive yet tough ex-engineer turned micro-carbon-sculptor -- a hard-boiled detective with a Zen attitude. The action begins when M. Sivart is presented with an investigation of a suicide that smells more of murder. The reader is lead on a fast paced tour of the scene of the crime and it's limited surrounds on the Robert E. Lee, one of the Wheelworlds in orbit around late 21st century Earth. Possible suspects are examined and clues revealed with a bit of assistance from Ray El-Sayed, a sympathetic station police investigator who has been officially warned off the case, and from the victim's significant other -- an exotic dancer with a most interesting love of her work. Additional assistance, and a humorous subplot are provided by Base Alicante, a doctor whose attraction to Gil Sivart is over ruled by his desire to make his young male lover jealous and more amorous.<br /><br />In this late 21st century setting, there are no tough challenges of learning heavy duty scientific or sociological concepts as the author has skillfully created a convincing backdrop for his story in plausible extensions forward of today's technologies. Fans of Steve Perry's SPINDOC and THE FOREVER DRUG novels -- or his MATADOR series -- will not be disappointed. And newcomers will find this a satisfying blend of the Mystery and Science Fiction genres. (EAG	1997-03-19
