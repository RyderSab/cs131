Filled with the most beautiful images from her advertising campaign. <br />Beware that the slipcover is very sensitive and damages easily! <br />Wow, i love this book!	2005-01-19

This designer who nobody knows in The Netherlands, perhaps only for her fragrances which are for sale in discount drugstores, has done her best to create this ode to herself. And that is exactly what it is. This book is only filled with pictures of Carolina throughout the years. Her children are also featured on a few pictures in this book. The book itself is beautiful and also the pictures are very nice. Don't get me wrong. But a book about a designer without pictures of models in her designs is just not possible i think. So if you want to buy this book to see an overview of her work don't buy this book! A few pictures in this book are not printed on the paper but inserted loosely so you can easily take them out. This makes it possible to frame them or something else with them. That's really nice. I can't wait for Donatella Versace to publish an ode to herself!!	2005-01-08

Beautiful pictures are in this book. There's a set of pictures where Mrs. Gray gets older and older. Or perhaps i should say, thinner and thinner. Or more anorexic that you could imagine. Pretty scary are these pictures of a topmodel that perhaps has suffered from this disease in real life... <br />But, it's still a beautiful book by the great Karl Lagerfeld.  <br />A musthave!	2004-11-12

But don't tell me it's about decorating. It's actually all about Kelly herself! I love these kind of books but this is a little bit too much. Have you ever seen an interior book filled with fullpage pictures of the decorator herself?? The reason why Kelly has written this book is so she could have a booklaunch party i guess where she could entertain her kind of people. Offcourse there are nice pictures in this book of interiors she has decorated. So buy the book and lay it on your coffetable. It will look great!	2004-04-18

Number 38: Love is the book of the season! Every fan of Visionaire should really buy this issue. Don't be suprised if this issue sells out very quickly. The book comes in a great blue Tiffany box and is really suprising! When you open the box there's a tiffany blue sleeperbag with inside a very old book. Around the outside is a silk string with a silver heart attached to it. This very exclusive heart is designed by Elsa Peretti for Tiffany &amp; Co. and can be worn as a necklace. When you open the book music starts playing. And then the journey begins. The journey to find out what Love really is........	2002-09-12

This book is filled with great pictures and tells you how Stephen and Tobias have met and about their travels. The stories are very interesting, printed like a diary.

I wanted to find pictures of beautiful decorated houses,nice gardens and offcourse the habitants of the mansions. Well, that's not quite what's inside this book. For the most only pictures of houses taken in the 50's and 60's and a lot of text!! I want pictures of Aerin Lauder and the Miller sisters!!	2001-08-15

Well that time has gone and now it is really not worth it anymore. This issue comes in a plastic sleeve and is a simple paper book. There's really nothing special about this item. When i heard that Mario Testino was the force behind this issue i thought it would be like his first issue, no. 22 chic. Well it is quite the opposite! Don't buy this item at bookstores but try to get it for less at auction sites.	2001-06-07

This book is very nice, but fo not buy it when you are looking for a book which takes a look inside these beautiful houses. It only shows the outside and ,i think, too many pictures of the gardens. It is really a nice book but i thought there would be many pictures of the houses and not so many detailed pictures of gardens...	2001-02-15

It should have arrived in october 1999, but as you probably know, the editors of Visionaire don't care about that. They probably think is is fashionably. Well, #29 is all  about Women, and nothing more. They are many nude pictures in the book and  what I think is really not nice, is a picture of a woman in her 70's naked.  Very nice are the various pictures by Mario Testino, and the drawings by  Mats Gustafson. My favorite is Lady Amanda Harlech by Karl Lagerfeld.  Fabulous pictures in black and white. One of the greatest things about  Visionaire is that they always come with a special gift and this time it is  a metal/chrome box around the book. Really great with a great design value.  Buy this one before it's sold out,because it comes in an limited edition of  6000 copies. Also look at Visionaire #28: the Bible. This comes with a  fabulous box designed by Philippe Starck.	2000-01-08
