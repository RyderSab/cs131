Why spiritual?  Because for the second straight book, Lehane portrays a world that is scarred by Evil.  Yes, we're dealing with diminished capacity in some cases, but what do think those references to Auschwitz are about?  Why is the warden in the story?  Can one be insane and evil? Lehane does an excellent job creating a sense of foreboding that keeps you glued to the pages.  He draws on King Lear (going mad during a storm), film (the Wicker Man), and recent tragedies (Andrea Yates' killing of her children) to tell the story of Shutter Island.  I read this book in two nights because I had to find out what fate awaits our protagonist, Teddy Daniels.  Shutter Island is a horror story that goes to the depths of our being.	2005-01-22

Raymond Shaw and his fellow G.I.s are captured in Korea, undergo \\"brainwashing\\", and are released believing that they, through the heroism of Sergeant Shaw, have been saved from a company of enemy infantry.  The encounter never took place, of course, but that's the story that will win Raymond the Medal of Honor.  However, Raymond has been conditioned to be the ulimate assassin.  Meanwhile Major Marco, Raymond's commanding officer in Korea, has been having terrible nightmares in which he sees Raymond killing two members of their patrol in cold blood.  He also sees himself and his patrol on a stage facing some high ranking Soviet and Chinese officals. The staggering nightmares cause Marco to start wondering if he, Raymond, and the others have been brainwashed.  This leads him on a frantic investigation to discover the truth before something disastrous happens.  Raymond can't recall any of what Marco has been dreaming about.  He has been completely conditioned twice over -- once by the Pavlovian doctors and also by his mother, Mrs. Iselin, probably the most evil villainess in all of literature.  She is the embodiment of Control and she savages anyone who gets in the way of her plans for domination.  The Manchurian Candidate is very fine writing.  Condon's style is eccentric but it is perfect for the bizarre, paranoid tale he is telling.  His portrayal of Raymond as a damned soul is moving.  Raymond, who is cursed with \\"crushing contemptuousness\\", is \\"impossible to like\\", but we can't help but be sympathetic to this young man who was never allowed to be himself, who was never allowed to feel.   Mrs. Iselin is over-the-top, but who cares?  She sends chills down your spine while providing some wicked humor.  The Manchurian Candidate is a Freudian cocktail that will give you lots to chew on.	2005-01-15

Nothing happens; there is nor growth in any of the characters, there are no decisions made, there are no actions taken.   The main characters pontificate, discourse and expostulate endlessly.  They think long and deep.  Everyone seems steeped in metaphysics, philosophy, literature, dialectics, etc.  But nobody does a damn thing.  There are at least three relationships that are not consummated.  Even when there is sex, it seems disconnected from the \\"pseudo reality\\" that is the milieu everyone moves in.  Everyone is planning for a grand jubilee for the Emperor Franz Joseph, but after incessant meetings, no one can decide how to proceed.  The only character who seems to do anything is the sexual psychopath, Moosbrugger, who is a serial murderer of women.  This is a very challenging book to read. You have to concentrate or you'll find that you've read several paragraphs or pages without knowing what you've just read.   The Man Without Qualities is the ultimate \\"novel of ideas\\" but the irony is that it seems to be contemptuous of ideas if they do not bear fruit through the actions of decisive men and women of action.  For a person or a culture without qualities, ideas are a paralyzing narcotic.	2005-01-15

Homer anticipates the Deadly Sins of the Christian age and warns of their destructive power for both individuals and society.  Achilles' selfish black anger leads to the death of countless Achaeans, including his best comrade, Patroclus.  The lust of Helen and Paris brings two empires to endless war.  Agamemnon's pride is the spark that sets off Achilles' anger.  Even the gods are portrayed as petty, meddling, partisans who can't use their power and wisdom to bring peace to the warring factions.  The Iliad is a brilliant depiction of the personal destructiveness of war.  When a man is killed in battle we learn exactly how he is slain; the depictions of death are not pretty.  We learn his name and that of his father.  Homer wants us to understand that these are not faceless extras who are the random casualties of war.  These are real men with unique identities who are killed in very specific ways.  The Iliad is a timeless epic that laments the frailties of our natures that lead to our undoing.	2004-11-27

Jacques Barzun in \\"From Dawn to Decadence\\" says that those who live in the midst of a Revolution often do not perceive the tidal wave of historical forces sweeping by them.  Nonetheless, they are acutely conscious of being caught up in a whirlwind.  In &quot;The White Guard&quot;, the characters do not expound in depth about the loss of the old order or imminent rise of the new one.  But they are terribly aware of the pain and upheaval that marks their daily lives.  Nikolka, Alexi, and Elena Turbin are members of a middle-class family in Kiev.  The time is 1918 and the Socialist Petlyura's army is outside the city.  Nikolka, Alexi, and their friends go out from the warmth of their apartment to do their part to thwart his advance.  However, the Germans, who were their erstwhile protectors, leave the city and are accompanied by the military and political leaders of Kiev. The Turbins and their friends feel betrayed.  After a brave but futile defense the `officers' (synonymous with upper middle class) rip off their identifying markings and attempt to blend in with the populous at large.  Looming in the background are the dreaded Bolsheviks and one gets the strong sense that the present troubles are but a hint of what is to come.  However, this imminence is not apparent to the Turbins.  They can neither glean nor control the inexorable flow of history. However, they can \\"Go on living...and be kind to one another...\\". The White Guard is a challenging but rewarding novel that, like much of great literature, exhorts the human spirit to persevere through trials and suffering.  It's exposition is simple but every incident is dense with meaning.  A superior novel.	2001-12-31

Lying Awake is the most sublime and beautiful contemporary novel that I have read in years. It poses one of the most essential theological issues that a person can face - how can we know when we have truly encountered the living God? Sister John of the Cross is a discalced Carmelite nun who lives the contemplative life in community with a small group of other sisters. After a hard childhood, Helen (Sister John's given name) decides she has a vocation for the Carmelites. Her first thirteen years are a 'desert' experience where she does not enjoy the presence of God. Suddenly, God fills Sister John of the Cross with the inexpressible joy of His presence. Sister is able to record her experiences in journals. She publishes a well-received book of verse. The other sisters admire or envy her for the graces she receives. However, Sister John's experiences are closely linked to the occurrence of migraines. After collapsing at a communal event, she undergoes a battery of tests. Her doctor reveals that she has a localized epileptic disorder. Surgery to remove a small meningioma will relieve Sister's symptoms but it will also cause her ecstatic experiences to cease. For Sister John, this would be an unspeakable loss. Worse yet, she is flooded with doubts that her encounters with God have not been genuine and have only been the by-product of her illness. Sister John must decide if she can give up her experiences and whether she can face the probability of another extended stay in the desert. Mark Salzman's prose is so pristine that it is in itself an instance of grace. Salzman is a non-Catholic who has amazingly penetrated the nature of contemplative spirituality and describes it in lean yet eloquent prose. The larger question that Salzman posits for all of us is this: can we know God intimately in and through imperfect circumstances? How can we know it is Him whom we are dealing with, and not just the induced result of our emotions, enthusiasms, or needs? And can God transcendthose inducements to still revel His love for us? I believe Salzman's answer is a resounding 'yes'. In this respect, Lying Awake is a spiritual work of the first order.	2001-12-26

Thebes, located in the remotest swamps of Mississippi, is a penal farm designed for the most recalcitrant black offenders. It is cut off from the outside world and no one is privy to the evil events that transpire there - except for some very powerful people in very high places.  Earl Swagger gets to experience the horrors of Thebes when he becomes its first white inmate. Earl `returns from the dead' for his `second coming' into Thebes, but this time he's part of a band of seven avenging angels.  The bad guys include a muscled, sadistic albino called `Big Boy', a milquetoast racist warden, and a machine-gun totting guard named \\"Section Boss'.   The warden inhabits an old, rotting mansion that's right out of William Faulkner.  There's even the Faulkneresque dysfunctional family that's cursed by the sin of Racism.  For all these interesting ingredients, Pale Horse Coming lacks the high-octane suspense of some Hunter's other novels.  Even at his best, Hunter's work is not serious literature.  If you like shoot-em-up action where Evil is put on the run, then you will enjoy Pale Horse Coming.	2001-12-21

Frank Conroy, an accomplished pianist in his own right, certainly knows his subject in Body &amp; Soul. Conroy's love and respect for music is skillfully conveyed through his fine writing. He infects the reader with his passion for music.  Although I have never studied music, I found the passages on music theory, great composers, and the actual 'craft' of music to be fascinating.  Music is the dominant motif in this novel that is Dickensian in spirit and execution (you can't help but think of 'Great Expectations'). The pacing of the book is excellent, as is the presentation of the characters. I have a few minor criticisms (some over-the-top saccharine descriptions of love making) but overall `Body &amp; Soul'  is satisfying, fun, and intelligent reading.	2001-08-15

I was led to read it by an article in the Atlantic Monthly that lamented the pretentiousness of much of contemporary writing.  Not only is the writing pretentious, but it doesnt say anything intelligible.  Appointment in Sammara, by contrast, tells a story in a direct manner while still revealing to us hidden truths about the human spirit.   Its not giving anything away to say that the story concerns the self-destruction of one Julian English.  Julian is suave, Protestant, lives in the finest neighborhood, and hangs out with the in crowd.  But Julian makes the mistake of throwing his drink into the face of a powerful, nouveau riche Irish Catholic. Suddenly, Julians support structures dont seem so firm. Julians descent is heart breaking because, although he is not an especially likeable person, John OHara still manages to make us care for him.  OHaras book was prophetic in that it portrays the end of WASP domination in America.  The book takes place in 1930 and was published in 1934  just six years after the Catholic Al Smith was denied the presidency by a virulent anti-Catholic backlash led, in part, by the Klan.  We're told that some of the locals in Pottsville are members of the the Klan. Twenty-six years later, in 1960, an Irish Catholic would be elected president.   Appointment in Samarra is a must read for those who are serious about the American novel.	2001-08-15

The only justification for this book is to take the reader through a tour of hell. For the characters in this book, hell is all about them. And as we read this amphetamine-drenched tale, we are also led through the netherworld. When Dante traveled through Hell, he had Virgil, an enlightened unbeliever, a noble pagan, as his guide. Dante was lead through hell to learn a lesson not just to gape at the horrific sights. We, however, have only James Ellroy as our guide.  I sometimes get the feeling in 'The Cold Six Thousand' that Ellroy is simply interested in showing us the garish sights -- the Klan, the Mob, unfettered racism, torture, speed, extortion, betrayal, crooked cops &amp; CIA agents, speed, J. Edgar Hoover, Howard Hughes, suicide, murder, sleaze, scalpings, speed, etc. Maybe we could argue that Ellroy wants to show us the true face of Evil that pervades our culture. I must admit that I read the book in several days. The pervasiveness of Evil fascinated me. But I don't know if I came through this trip with one glimmer of hope or enlightenment. Perhaps what Ellroy wants us to learn is that we are intrigued and attracted to power, greed, and violence just like his characters are. If that's the case, then I tip my hat to him for revealing this distressing fact about myself.	2001-06-27

He is consistently dark where Elmore Leonard can be whimsical. His violence transcends the shoot-em-up stuff of Stephen Hunter. He has a gift for dialogue and can plumb deep into a character's psyche. He is undoubtedly street wise. But American Tabloid is still marked by graphic violence, rumor, gossip, sex, drugs, and perversion. Beneath the veneer of getting to the real historical facts, there is a lot of 'skank' here. And I think we need to ask ourselves if we are being titillated by an expanded version of \\"Hush-Hush\\". We need to examine why we are drawn to the episodes of murder and violence. A writer like Joseph Conrad examined the dark side of man without incessant violence leaping from every page. I'm not trying to be a prig; I'm honestly trying to understand if this is a 'moral' book. I'm also trying to understand whether this is 'good' writing. The characters of Ward Littel and Boyd Kemper are interesting in their tragic dimensions. Big Pete is simply a goon; to attempt to pull anything else out of his character is folly. We already know that JFK was Bill Clinton on steroids, that Hoover was an malevolent closet queen, that the mob is powerful, evil and pervasive. Ellroy does a nice job drawing a conflicted RFK. The book does an effective job of exposing the evil that lurks beneath the surface of historical events. The question is whether or not Ellroy's writing transcends this evil.	2001-06-23

Once you get beyond that though, there's decapitations, rapes, castrations, the mild titillations of the 'Flower World', and a host of laughable characters. There's Andre Poncin, the syphilitic spy with the perverse heart; there's the impossibly beautiful Angelique with the hourglass waist who every man swoons over; there's the tyrannical Tess Straun (whom we never meet) who makes men and women quake with fear. There are plots within plots that are sometimes hard to follow due to Clavell's butchering of the English language. Despite all this, the book is strangely enjoyable in a depraved way. There are so many loose ends at the book's end that it is obvious that Clavell was planning a sequel. Alas, Mr. Clavell passed on and we'll never know what happened to our poor Angelique, the dashing Mr.Gornt, or the wicked Tess.	2001-05-12

The Name of the World&quot; is a book written for certain graduates of creative writing programs.  It is overwrought with symbolism. Our protagonist has lost his wife and daughter in an automobile accident with a florist's delivery truck. While teaching at a sterile Midwestern college, he is attracted to a local eccentric named Flower Cannon (get it?). Life at the dysfunctional campus gets particularly wearisome when a huge blizzard paralyzes the region, underscoring the paralysis that marks the everyday lives of Collegeville. During a chance visit to a brain-damaged rehab center, our protagonist is mesmerized by an inmate who staggers around with his hand held high holding ... something symbolic. The patients here aren't much different than the local academics who lurch through life in a stupor. They really don't know who they are. Not too worry, though.  Our hero loses his job at the college but eventually winds up as a journalist in the Gulf War. Meaning is found flying through the battle zone in a helicopter. This is an old literary conceit (see Tennyson's &quot;Maude&quot;) -- when life stinks, you can always go off to war.	2001-04-29

I have read all four books of the Ender series in rapid-fire succession.  Let me qualify that -- I have completed the first three books in the series and I am almost finished with &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;.  But because life is short and I have other things to read, I am not going to finish it. In &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;, Card loses control of his subject matter.  There are too many subplots, too many weird happenings, and too little restraint in Card's imagination for the story to be either coherent or reasonable. Even Fantasy writing must adhere to the disciplines of the craft. &quot;Ender's Game&quot; was a disciplined effort marked by a lean prose style. &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; became denser in its presentation, but Card displayed generosity of spirit and compassion for wounded individuals and families. He touches upon some sensitive subjects (adultery, alcoholism, spousal abuse, and deception) that scar real families in real life.  His treatment of religion is balanced and interesting and he resists the knee-jerk reaction of many contemporary writers to bash the Catholic Church. &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; is the high-point in the series.  Things start to unravel a bit in &quot;Xenocide&quot; as Card attempts to weave multiple subplots (the 'piggies', the deadly descolada virus, the 'buggers', &quot;Jane&quot;, and the 'Godspoken' of the planet Path}. Still, there are some real insights into the human heart here that are compelling and Card's compassion for individuals is still central to the book. In &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; things get chaotic and, ultimately, very, very boring. Ender literally 'births' children of the mind who are his real bother and sister as they were in their youth. He does this while traveling in the 'Outside'. But are they really his brother and sister or are they really him? Meanwhile 'Jane' the sentient, omniscient being is really Ender too -- sort of. And the fate of piggies, the buggers, the descolada virus, the Planet Luistania, indeed the entire universe is in the balance. But we have a Polynesian holy man, a Chinese philosopher, and thinking trees who used to animals all working on the problem. Card has a real challenge to tie this all together.  I appreciate his compassion, but he just went one book too far.	2001-04-21

This is an orthodox Catholic novel, written by an orthodox author, published by the very orthodox Ignatius Press. Since I consider myself an orthodox Catholic, I was predisposed to treat this book sympathetically. But I also appreciate good writing and that's what we're critiquing here -- writing, not simply ideas. Structurally, this novel is a mess. It meanders all over the place in totally unnecessary side trips. The dialogue is right out of &quot;Tom Terrific&quot;, often delivered by cartoonish characters. O'Brien doesn't seem to have put too much effort into revising and editing this very long novel.  As a result, it lacks the tightness and coherence that his &quot;Plague Journal&quot; demonstrated.  Moreover, one got the sense from &quot;Plague Journal&quot; that O'Brien was writing out of his own personal pain (as the provider for six children).  This gave the book a genuine feel that is lacking in &quot;The Eclipse of the Sun&quot;. Look, the 'good guys' have to write as competently as the 'bad guys'. Just because O'Brien is on the right side doesn't by default make this a good book.	2001-01-14

Nobody but Kerouac could describe the horror and suffering of alcoholism in lyrical, fluent prose. The opening pages show Kerouac's true gift as a writer. I often pick this book up at book stores and re-read the mesmerizing beginning where Jack wakes up 'all woe-begone and goopy' as the church bells play a mournful version of &quot;I'll take you home again, Kathleen&quot;.  He describes the alcoholic's hangover as the worst experience on earth -- like standing in pork blood as a 'mudman backbent monster' pulling 'a long hot burden to nowhere'. Atute readers will see hints of Jack's descent into depression and alcoholism in his earlier works. In &quot;Big Sur&quot; Jack openly acknowledges the nature of his suffering.  Sadly, he would go on to drink himself to death. Kerouac's true gift lies in his original voice as an witer and not in being a joyful icon of the open road.  &quot;Big Sur&quot; eloquently shows that the man suffered enormously.	2000-12-24

Can a totalitarian state run by liberals, feminists, and new-agers take hold in North America?  According to Nathaniel Delaney, the protaganist of &quot;Plague Journal&quot;, it already has and if you don't conform to the new orthodoxies, you're quite expendable. While &quot;Plague Journal&quot; is a paranoid Christian polemic, it is redeemed by the hero's realization that anger, hatred, and solipsism have no place in a true Christian's response to evil.  &quot;Plague Journal&quot; is the story of a man who loses everything but who re-discovers his faith in the depth of his sufferings.  O'Brien is a skilled writer and an astute thinker. Despite the polemics, this is an amazing book.  Kudos to Ignatius Press for publishing it, but it's too bad it hasn't gotten more attention from the literary media.	2000-12-24

I have to say that I found &quot;Windswept House&quot; to be an exciting novel of suspense that attempts to understand the battle between the Church and Evil.  I really enjoyed reading it.  Having said that, let me say that I have real problems with the book.  It is libelous and slanderous. While pedophilia is a grosteque problem within the church, Martin goes too far by suggesting that the late Cardinal Bernadin was the head of a satanic, pedophilic ring. It was clear to me that Martin based his creepy cardinal of &quot;Century City&quot; on Bernadin.  I later read an interview with him where he said that this was indeed the case. This is not only a lack of Christian charity but is pure, sinful slander.  What possible good can Martin's book do on balance when he engages in this sort of character defamation?  Read Michael O'Brien's &quot;Plague Journal&quot; to see a true Christian response to Evil.  As a suspense novel, I'd give &quot;Windswept House&quot; 5 stars; as a Christian novel, I give it one.	2000-12-24

In awe of his subject, Vidal was able to resist his usual cynicism and didacticism. &quot;The Golden Age&quot; however, is marked by anecdote, innuendo, and gossip. This is because Vidal was a contemporary of the events described in the novel.  Indeed, he himself appears as a character several times throughout the book. In a strange stylistic device, Vidal, the character / author, usurps the narrative function from his alter ego, Peter Sanford, in the last chapter of the book. Although Vidal's suspicions that the U.S. government strives to keep us in a state of perpetual crisis are a bit much, his views are somewhat entertaining from a narrative perspective. And who or what is the manipulative Clay Overby supposed to represent?  America's innate prediliction to fascism?  Or our society's penchant to become infatuated with surface beauty?  &quot;The Golden Age&quot; will give you plenty to talk about and maybe that is Vidal's goal -- to get us to return to the lost art of intellectual discussion.	2000-12-17

I found the Red Hat to be a page turner about the alleged current struggle  in the Catholic Church to define what Vatican II was really all about.  The  reason I say 'alleged' is that the average Catholic has no idea that the  struggle is going on, what the issues are about, or who the players are.   It's really a conflict that's being waged by intellectuals, pundits, and  professionals. Still, the book is smart and a lot of fun. There's some  over-the-top bad guys and many humorous observations that keep the story  moving swiftly.  On a serious note, there's some moving scenes of  individuals trying to work out their personal conflicts with faith. <br />By  the way, did I miss something in real life?

To give the book balance, the Sandinistas don't come across as angels (which they weren't). The book is also graced with wit and humor.  The IRA and the CIA are thrown in to spice things up a bit.

US	49229181	R1ERR3EPZ4GYG4	067084134X	855770597	Ravelstein	Books	3	14	15	N	N	It's really about Saul Bellow.	Ostensibly Ravelstein is about the late professor of political philosophy, Allan Bloom, who became a star late in his career when he published his best-selling book, The Closing of the American Mind. Chick, the narrator,  gives us a long sketch about Ravelstein/Bloom, particularly focusing on his  opulent, rock-star life style, which Chick rationalizes away because  Ravelstein doesn't really care about it.  But then why does he insist on  this decadence?  Why does he spend money like throwing it from the back of  a train?  Also, Ravelstein's homosexuality (his 'irregular' sex) doesn't  bother the broad-minded Chick because Ravelstein can't stand effeminate men  (we're told of this fact several times). All this explaining away of what  Chick sees as Ravelstein's foibles is ironic because Ravelstein himself  constantly points out to Chick that he (Chick) regularly explains away the  bad characters of other people he finds useful (e.g. - the shallowness of  his beautiful ex-wife Vera; the grim past of the amusing fascist  Grielescu). So the book, is really about Chick/Bellow, about his musing on  the plight of the Jews, his reflections on his own mortality, the pains and  joys he shares with his much younger, very beautiful wives. We get much  more clinical information about Chick's infection with cigua-toxin  poisoning than we do with Ravelstein's plight with AIDS. His illness is  detailed to a much greater degree than is Ravelstein's. The book has the  usual urbane discourses that are a hall-mark of Bellow's novels. I found it  enjoyable reading.  It is an impressive achievement for an octogenarian.   But I wasn't taken in by Ravelstein the way Chick was. But than again, how  can we be taken in if he is just a lens through which we view Chick?	2000-07-22
US	49229181	R34M9RKJG8IFRY	0374120803	575060326	Charming Billy	Books	2	6	10	N	N	Lush prose will eventually wear you down.	Alice McDermatt has undeniable writing talent as demonstrated by the prose in this book. But after awhile the lush prose starts to weary you like too much sweet wine. Hemingway once referred to Fitzgerald's 'cheap Irish love  of failure'.  Boy, if he had only read 'Charming Billy'. As a Catholic of  Irish descent, I'm getting real tired off all these tales about doomed,  alcoholic Irish Catholic families.  Billy's problem is that he is a fool  (literally), who, can't or won't straighten himself out. I couldn't care  about this guy who, for all his passivity, is an abusive, manipulative  husband.  Of course the usual bunch of enablers is around to watch Billy  drink himself to death. The book has a forced, token redemption at the end  when Billy's long-suffering widow marries his best friend. Is this book  better than a lot of the trash on Amazon that gets 5 stars? Absolutely.   But it must be judged as a serious, literary effort, not as a pulp novel.  Using that criteria, I give it 2 stars.	2000-07-16
US	49229181	R2IO9X9YPMTUSK	0446360856	38570142	The Gold Coast	Books	2	9	15	N	N	Boring, unconvincing and meaningless.	I posted a anonymous review of this book last year that no one found helpful. So, I'll put my name to it and post the same review again. After about 50 pages, I started to wonder if John Sutter was going to quit making  sarcastic asides. As someone once said, cynics are a dime a dozen. After  awhile this incessant sarcasm becomes very tedious. I didn't find Frank  Bellarosa to be a seductive man, so I don't understand why John and Susan  found him seductive. This is why I call the book unconvinving. If the main  conceit fails -- that dangerous, criminal Bellarosa is charming and  attractive -- how are we to belive that John and Susan can be seduced?  And  if they're that easy to fall for a creep like Bellarosa, then why should we  care for them? John and Susan, for all their kinky trysts, are boring.  Ultimately, what is the book about? Is there any redemption or even any  growth in the characters? It is offensive to compare this book with the  Great Gatsby which is a work of great literature. The plight of Jay Gatsby  is universal -- how do we handle loss? To what length do we go to prove  ourselves as worthwhile human beings? The Gold Coast shouldn't be compared  with Fitzgerald's masterwork.	2000-07-16
US	49229181	R3B9IXZJ0W0QD7	0670887315	929204920	Disgrace	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Restrained tale about guilt and denial.	Disgrace is a story about a sinful nation that, because of its past sins, cannot feel justified rage at the new injustices that are now being perpetrated on the minority white population. Yes, it's elegant, sparse,  economical, etc. but underneath this whited sepulchre (even the book jacket  is a sparse, clean, white cover) is an ugly reality that the promised myth  of peace and reconciliation isn't happening. The disgrace  lies in the  inability, or refusal, of people like Lurie's daughter to condemn the  outrages of her attackers.  I read the book over 7 months ago, so I'm  working from memory.  Maybe mine is a misreading.  I believe that the  author's restraint and sparse style are a fine stylistic technique, but I  was ultimately left frustrated by the hopelessness that this style  represents.	2000-07-15

Talk about page turners! Vidal show us the psyche and vast intelligence of Lincoln at work.  Lincoln was an absolute political genius who totally out wits his many Machiavellian  rivals. Readers will love the way Lincoln gives his opponents slack and  then reels them into the net of his will. Vidal also underscores Lincoln's  total commitment to the 'Union' which, for Lincoln, is the most sacred of  concepts. There is a host of supporting characters, particularly Salmon  Chase, who are aptly drawn and who engage the reader's interests. This is  amazing fiction, yet you will learn more about Lincoln in these pages than  in a half-dozen good biographies. This is a book that is both profound and  entertaining and I unequivocally recommend it.	2000-07-15

This is an elegant and sensitve work about our need to have something to live for, about our all-consuming task to find meaning to our quotidian existance. We are like Louis, our doomed vampire, stalkng the alley ways of  our life trying to enrich and enoble it with passion. Louis cannot enjoy  his existence because he is 'undead', neither a mortal being nor a spirit  freed from the physical limitations of the body.  He can only satisfy his  blood lust.  But something within him, some leftover of his humanity,  demands companionship, love, an appreciation of beauty. And this need  becomes his true compulsion, it becomes the thing that keeps him going  rather than his blood fixes. But no matter how much he yearns for deeper  meaning, he can never have it as a vampire. However, the paradox is that  this yearning itself is a passion that gives his being depth, character and  that nullifies in a strange way his 'undead' state. In the end, Louis is  more alive than those of us who move day to day getting our 'fixes' so that  we can rise to yet another meaningless day. We have an advantage over  Louis, Claudia, Lestat and the other vampires -- we're alive. We need to  emulate Louis' search for love, companionship, and spiritual beauty while  we have the means.	2000-07-15
US	49229181	R2HGTVMS2221SY	0060930861	901054422	Cloudsplitter: A Novel	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A haunting, elegiac work.	A haunting, lyrical work about a non-descript boy who is forced to into  radical introspection by his domineering father.  A tale of immense sadness  about Owen Brown and his relationship with his famous father, John Brown.  Owen, mesmerized by John and his heroic stance concerning slavery can never  become his own man. The writing is superb, especially the eerie scene where  Owen and John, through an unusual twist of geo-physics, helplessly witness  a tragedy taking place miles away across the prarie. A fascinating  historical novel with a finely detailed main character(Owen)who cannot  escape the demands of a heroic, but ultimately dysfunctional family. I've  forgotten many of the books I've read over the past several years, but not  this one.	2000-07-07
US	49229181	R2IP84E8K0P6ZA	0425167720	89472327	An Instance of the Fingerpost	Books	5	8	8	N	N	A fascinating read.	I'm suprised that some reviewers found this book boring -- I tore through it in about 4 days. I'll admit that the first 100 pages are somewhat pedestrian as the first (and most balanced) of the 4 narrators sets the  stage for the wilder musings of the latter 3 narrators. I immediately  thought of the Japanese film 'Roshomon' when I read this book as four  different narrators describe the same events from different perspectives.   One is coy, one is mad, one is evil, and the last is weak and tragic.   Together, they piece together a story of betrayal, deceit, sacrifice, and  cruelty.  Students of religion will not only enjoy the Catholic / Church of  England wranglings, but also the descriptions of the Messianic sects that  were appearing at that time (one can recognize elements of 20th century  renewal movements in the description of these sects). I found this book in  the 'Mystery' section of the bookstore.  If you're looking for hard-boiled  detective fiction, this isn't it.  If you're looking for an erudite and  intriguing story, I recommend this book.	2000-07-04

And while Lehane may know Boston, it sounds like he's never been beyond Route 128.  No one in Western MA refers to Boston as  'downtown' (as the amputee at the motel does). I'm not a big fan of  detective fiction, but I followed this up with Robert Parker's 'Small  Vices', another detective yarn set in Boston.  I found Parker's book to be  superior in execution and pacing.	2000-07-04
