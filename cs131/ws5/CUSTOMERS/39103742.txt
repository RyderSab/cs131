I found the site, hotel and restaurant reviews consistent with my own experiences (albeit my sample size was small).  But this book has key drawbacks that made me regret the weight it took up in my baggage:  (1) place names for hotels, restaurants, sites, etc. are generally given only in English.  Most tourists will get around these cities by cab.  Cab drivers in China almost never speak any English.  Nor will most Chinese on the street, should you want to ask directions.  Thus, giving these names in both Chinese characters and Pinyin (romanized Chinese, so American travelers could at least try to pronounce them), should be mandatory for any guidebook you actually want to take with you to China.  (2)  The maps are confusing and, worse, sometimes inaccurate.  Separate maps are given for hotels, sites and restaurants, and the formats differ, making it harder than it needs to be to figure out, say, how to reach a given site from your hotel.  Many streets are unlabeled, making it hard to use the maps when walking around.  It's not clear whether the maps are to scale, and scales aren't provided, so the maps can't be used to predict how far away things are.  (3)  Little information is given even on key sites.  It would be better to find a guidebook that included little maps of large sites and major museums, as well as detailed background information.  (4)  The phrasebook section is far too limited, includes phrases you won't actually need (e.g., phrases for checking into hotels, although every hotel listed will have English-speaking reception staff), and omits phrases you definitely will want (e.g., phrases for asking directions and navigating customs) as well as phrases that could make your trip more fun (e.g., a basic foot-massage vocabulary).  Finally, it should be noted that, like other Fodor's titles, this book is geared towards travelers who might be somewhat afraid of leaving their \\"luxury bubble.\\"  Unless you are willing to set the book aside and explore on your own, using this book will shield you from a lot of wonderful experiences.	2005-09-30

The publisher has provided a compact and inexpensive edition, probably best suited as a back-up reference copy for English majors or a portable copy for people who want to travel with this book.  The paper is poor quality and the typeface is fairly small, making this a difficult edition to read easily.  The only content added to the basic KJV is a table of contents, a brief index with topics such as \\"vitamins for the soul\\", and a reasonably useful glossary/concordance at the back, in case you want to know what leprosy is or who Aaron was.  Proper names in the text itself are given with phonetic aids (syllabification, stress marks, and vowel quality signs), which you may or may not appreciate.  On balance, the book is probably fairly priced -- it's a cheap, mediocre printing.	2005-08-17

In stretches it reads almost like a novel.  Asbridge discusses the various motivations of the crusade, ranging from genuine religiosity down to the desires of younger sons to carve out their own fiefdoms.  The history centers on the leaders -- the \\"generals\\" of the crusading army, the Byzantine Emperor, the Pope and his delegates -- giving relatively little information on the lot of the ordinary crusader.  The key figures, however, come through more as titles, dates and events than as vividly depicted human beings; this may be a inevitable limitation of a book intended as history and not as an historical novel.  Military tactics and weapons, too, are given only superficial treatment.  By contrast, the politics, alliances and strategy are covered in some depth.	2005-08-05

Piston's book, however, should definitely be carefully studied by anyone wanting to master the art of classical orchestration.  Piston goes deeper into each instrument than Kennan does, establishing a root level of knowledge on top of which Kennan can then serve as a handy daily reference.  Piston relies heavily on examples from the core classical repertoire (well into the early 20th century but not beyond), so access to a good CD library will go a long way in bringing this book to life.	2005-08-05

This is one of the rare few.  I first got acquainted with the book a quarter century ago, and have been using it ever since.  The book assumes basic competence in music performance and theory.  The necessary information about the various instruments is provided simply and accessibly -- e.g., where the timbre breaks occur on the clarinet, how to figure out if a particular triple-stop can be fingered on the viola, etc.  There is also useful guidance in writing for sections and other combinations of instruments, although nothing can replace a good set of ears and numerous years of orchestral or band playing time for learning that particular skill.  Kennan helpfully distinguishes what is practical and idiomatic (what an ordinarily competent player can be expected to be able to do) from what is possible (what the best players might be able to pull off on a good day).  Thus, this book should be useful for everything from making high school band arrangements to writing for professional orchestras.	2005-08-05

As an agnostic, I did not at all expect to find him a sympathetic figure.  The \\"Confessions,\\" however, reveal a warmly human, hugely intelligent man, relating his own open-minded spiritual journey, which included way-stops at Manicheeism and neo-Platonism.  Augustine formulated his religious and ethical systems through careful deliberation and observation, aided by an epiphany or two; his is not a story of blind, unthinking faith or of mysterious visions.  His concept of God seems little different from the Chinese concept of the Tao, and his concept of grace little different from the Buddhist concept of enlightenment.  Thus, there is considerable interest in his viewpoint even for non-Catholics, non-Christians, and non-believers. <br /> <br />In addition, this book also constitutes an autobiography of material existence in the waning years of the Western Roman Empire, and thus should be of great interest to any classicist.  Little examples:  Augustine confirms that, at least around 400 A.D., the normal way to read, even among the most highly literate, was aloud; Ambrose's habit of reading silently to himself inspires considerable comment and speculation.  We learn that high school students were rowdy, then as now.  The Roman Emperor didn't seem to matter much in the lives of citizens. <br /> <br />The Penguin translation by Mr. Pine-Coffin is excellent and very readable.  He avoids the archaic \\"thou's\\" that plague many translations.  Regrettably, the cover material chooses to emphasize the translator's status as a Roman Catholic as his single most important attribute, and his introductory comments are likely to strike non-Catholics as intolerant.  Skip over that, and get right into Augustine's writing itself.	2005-07-14

Irregular forms are typically listed separately, which is especially critical for those of us still struggling with Latin's abundant irregular verbs.  Many proper names are also included, which is useful in recognizing their sometimes unpredictable declensions.  The grammer and versification sections are too rudimentary to be of much help, but conversely they take up very little space.

My own copy is quite well-worn.  However, beginners should know that the instructions for extract brewing can quite adequately be set out in about 2 or 3 pages.  Extract brewing is barely more difficult than baking a cake, so producing a whole book on the topic requires somewhat the same type of padding as occurs in diet books.  The short instruction sheets my homebrew store supplied were plenty adequate to teach the topic, in the sense of getting started.  The detailed discussions of biochemistry may be of interest to some, but are certainly not needed for basic brewing.  Only a few recipes are included, so this book really doesn't suffice as a recipe guide.    Homebrewers ready for all-grain brewing will of course need more information and instruction, for which Mr. Papazian's \\"Homebrewer's Companion\\" is a good start; it repeats enough from this first volume that my advice would be to buy \\"Companion\\" instead, when you're ready to go all-grain.  A single volume that combined both books, taking beginners from their first batch of extract brew into all-grain brewing, would be a perfect thing.	2005-05-20

Every aspect of grammer is covered, in lessons that combine explanations (in English) with plenty of drill exercises.  Helpfully, complete answers are provided in an Appendix, so this book is ideal for self study.  Lessons can be taken in any order.  I've found that cycling through this book every year or so works wonders for keeping my French from getting rusty.  Although a complete vocabulary isn't provided, anyone using this book should already have mastered basic vocabulary and should already own a dictionary.  In any event, vocabulary lists in each lesson cover most of the words that might otherwise send a review-level student to the dictionary.  Especially at such a reasonable price, this is a book that anyone wanting to keep their French up should not hesitate to buy.	2005-05-19

This gives the book a breezy, brisk tone; it reads quite quickly.  It is not a reference-quality history, lacking footnotes or even a bibliography of primary sources.  There are no illustrations or maps.  Surprisingly little feel for the flavor of medieval life comes through.  The basic history of kings and popes and wars is all there, however.  For readers not yet familiar with the historical period, this book would serve as a decent introductory overview.	2005-05-19

(Reading knowledge of Classical Latin, as opposed to Vulgar Latin, is far less necessary, since Old French is much, much closer to modern French than to Classical Latin.)  The book jumps right in with reading passages (not translated) covering a complete \\"lai\\" by Marie de France.  Old French is close enough to modern French (and even to modern English) that these passages are readable without great confusion, using the concordance at the end of the volume for help.  This book does have several weaknesses:  (1) Instead of a true vocabulary/glossary, the book provides only a concordance, listing each and every word in the grammatical form in which it appears, with specific line references.  While this enables assured translations, it is not a convenient resource for further readings or for vocabulary drills.  (2)  The phonology sections will be confusing to non-specialists.  Since the texts in the book are poetry, a simpler, more straightforward guide to pronounciation and scansion, in Lesson One, would have been nice.  (3)  The grammatical explanations cover the bases, but are not always as clear as they could be.  In particular, explanations of grammatical changes over the language's evolution could more easily have been presented in the form of chronological charts, or one particular form could have been used as a consistent base, with historical variants covered in notes or an appendix.	2005-05-19

Betty Edwards has clearly devoted countless hours of time both to teaching and thinking about teaching.  The result is an extremely well-thought-out course, not only -- or even primarily -- in drawing, but rather in the perceptual skills that lead directly to being able to draw.  She sees drawing, at the level of being able to draw, say, a realistic and recognizable portrait, as a skill that is as readily learnable by an average person as driving or reading.  She reduces this skill to a handful of separate elements, each clearly taught and explained, with exercises designed not only to teach the skill but also to quickly build self-confidence.  Although the book emphasizes general perceptual skills, enough tips on materials and techniques are provided to help beginners quickly learn to draw pictures that will please them.  Whether you continue to develop your drawing skills or not, at the very least this book will help you appreciate the visual world in a new way.	2005-05-19

This is made abundantly clear (if it wasn't already) by Hadrian's discussion near the end of the book about his choice of successor.  (No plot spoilage coming up so long as the reader of this review already knows basic Roman history.)  He describes his choice of the middle-aged Antoninus, and adds that he has sought to preserve the Empire through the following generation as well through his choice of Marcus Aurelius (the \\"you\\" to whom the letter is addressed.)  The entire tone of the novel is that of a letter from an aging, dying grandfather to an (adopted) youthful grandson, and from a sensualist to a stoic.  Being mistaken about the identity of the audience of the memoir would completely change one's understanding and appreciation of the book.	2005-04-06

Horace is a frequently complicated, dense poet, so the translations are often rather complicated and dense.  A reasonable number of explanatory notes are provided in the back.

For example, issues such as the efficient use of a relatively small professional army, or the maintenance of client states, are directly relevant to the modern world.

His descriptions of trials, and of his often slimy opposing counsel, will amuse modern attorneys.  The letters between Pliny and the Emperor Trajan read much like modern e-mails between a CEO and a diligent corporate manager.  I first read Pliny at the same time as the \\"Meditations\\" of Marcus Aurelius; the two books provide a striking contrast between two typically Roman world-views  -- Pliny wanting nothing so much as posthumous fame, Aurelius musing on the vanity of all earthly pursuits given their utter meaninglessness after we turn to dust. <br /> <br />Ms. Radice's translation is smooth and enjoyable, retaining a certain air of distance given the source's antiquity but not becoming stilted or precious.	2004-09-16

It conveys the glory of Napoleon's Italian campaign and the horror of the reactionary counter-revolution.  At its center, however, is a love triangle among a Duchess, her nephew (albeit not by blood) Fabrice, and Fabrice's great love Clelia, allowing Stendhal to give us a meditation on the fortuitousness of love, its hazards and its disappointments; at the end the book is dedicated, in English, \\"TO THE HAPPY FEW.\\"  Its view on these matters is more Mediterranean than Anglo-Saxon; for example, any reader with a heart will be rooting for Fabrice and Clelia, even while Fabrice is a priest and Clelia is married to someone else. <br /> <br />Anyone with a couple years of college French should be able to read the original without difficulty, although there may be something to be said for trying to read the novel in as wild a rush as it was composed.	2004-09-13

Unlike texts that prepare students for Caesar or Cicero, this one prepares you for the Aeneid.  The initial readings are prose adaptations from Ovid's Metamorphoses, which get closer and closer to the original poetry used from Lesson 30 on. The authors deserve credit for being good storytellers as well as good teachers, crafting prose versions of Ovid in simple Latin which nevertheless hold entertainment value over the multiple re-readings useful for drill; these are much more enjoyable to read than the stray bits of modified Cicero and Livy on which Wheelock's text is based.  As a bonus, in addition to covering the basics of Latin the student will get a grounding in Classical mythology.	2004-08-30

It relates all the key Graeco-Roman myths, with Norse myths treated perfunctorily at the end.  Hamilton learned Greek and Latin as a little girl and wrote her books late in life; they read like the works of someone who spent a lifetime reading the classics for personal pleasure.  Readers using this book as an introductory guide should be aware of Hamilton's prejudices:  she prefers the Greeks to the Romans, and writers who believed in the stories to those who did not.  As a result, you might be wrongly discouraged from classical authors such as Ovid (whom Hamilton seems to actively despise), even though Ovid's worldview is strikingly similar to our modern one and his writing vivid and enjoyable.  But if you approach this book as an opinionated presentation by a genuine enthusiast, as opposed to an effort at scholarly objectivity, you will not likely regret being caught up in the passion the author brought to this material.	2004-08-30
