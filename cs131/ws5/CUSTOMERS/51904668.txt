US	51904668	R2BB1UJOYTY1F8	0768912024	847947706	Master the GMAT CAT 2004 (Book & CD-Rom)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Eight CAT tests on the CD-ROM are good.	This book comes with a very useful CD-ROM, which has eight computer-adaptive, actual-test-like diagnostic tests.  The questions on these tests are very applicable to the GMAT, but the scoring is a little harsh, i.e. expect your actual GMAT score to be just a little higher than those on these diagnostic tests.  Hence, the book itself is not spectacular, but it is worth buying just for the CD-ROM.	2004-03-08
