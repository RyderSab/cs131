This book is 600 pages but it reads very easy and quick!<br /><br />The book reads very easy- in each chapter you read about all three main characters in separate little paragraphs, so you are kept completely upto date with each character as the story unfolds.<br /><br />The story spans a time of 40 years with three main characters, Amber, Becky and Madeline.  Amber is the daughter of a very wealthy man who escaped Nazi Germany during the war.  Becky is from \\"plain\\" American folks, and befriends Amber, Amber loves Becky's home and Mother because she is the mothering loving Mother that Amber does not have at home.  Her mother is an alcholic that drinks herself into a deep sleep.<br /><br />Madeline is also from a war torn european country that is suffering from a war about religion.  She also befriends Amber and Becky.<br /><br />Like I said the book is over 600 pages but it read very quickly and it was extremely enjoyable!<br /><br />I recommend this to everyone!	2005-09-17

I had alot of questions at the end that I think could have been written about more.<br /><br />I did like the book very much- I loved the premise of it- but<br /><br />I just felt given what My Sister's Keeper gave us as far as information, that this one lacked it at the end.<br /><br />I do recommend reading it for everyone.	2005-03-26

Example- the first chapter is written by Anna in first voice so you can imagine and feel how Anna feels.  The most heart wrenching for me were when the mother \\"talks\\" in her chapters and she explains her love for both of her children. Very tough-<br /><br />This storyline affects everyone in the family- the brother, Jessie has emotional and drug problems stemming from his sisters'critcal situation.  Anna- of course because she is expected to donate without thinking of the consequences to her or her body.  Brian-the father and how he works himself to escape the turmoil of his homelife.  Sara-the mother who wants to \\"save Kate\\" at all costs and how this affects her as a mother, and wife.  Kate- the child with the cancer- how all of this effects her and how all these medical procedures wreck havoc on her body.<br /><br />Cambell- Anna's lawyer who is hiding a secret that comes out further in the book and how this 13year old child affects his life.<br /><br />Julia-the Assigned gardium ad liteum for Anna and her past with Cambell.<br /><br />Great book- almost alittle scary because this could be a \\"real life\\" story- especially with all the modern medical technology that we have today!	2005-03-02

After seeing this book on the bestseller lists for awhile, I thought I would give it a go....<br /><br />I liked the idea of this book, that a man who felt his life on earth was meaningless and didn't have any defination of anything great- dies during a selfless act of kindness for a little girl.  He-goes to heaven and encounters 5 different people, some have complete relevance in his life, some in a very strange and obscure way they are relative to his life.<br /><br />This book was sort of on the idea of a few books,and movie- A Wonderful Life- in the movie Jimmy Stewart gets a chance to view thru an Angel the lives that he has changed because he was born.  This book describes the five lives that Eddie touched and how he didn't even realize that he did.<br /><br />This book also reminded me of ... A Christmas Carol, again, a spirit comes to Ebeneezer Scrooge, and he revisits his life and the people that he has touched thru the years.<br /><br />I am not saying this book was completely like either of these books, but it had a hint of them for ME when I was reading it.<br /><br />It was enjoyable, it was thought provoking to think who would MY five people be- and I did enjoy it.	2004-11-13

I was curious to see what it was all about.<br />I was alittle &quot;spooked&quot; for the first two chapters- as I have a fourteen year old girl and it was alittle disconcerting for me to read how the character died.  After I got past that part the book was excellent.  Very interesting concept on how she views her &quot;new world&quot; and her old with memories that keep coming back in to her memory of her life on earth.<br />I do recommend this to people, but my recommendation is to not read the first chapters right before bed!!

Nice and relaxed, so I thought I would give this book a go thru. At first, &quot; Cheese&quot; what does this mean??? Well, like the books says, it can mean anything you want it to. Each quote, in the book was a different situation and fits to several different things going on in my life. Some huge some just trivial things. I also found myself alot like some of the characters, Hem- who doesn't want to do anything except complain about it!!! Haw- who goes after it and tries to look for it, again and again. The two mice who just go from the beginning and look for it with no regard to Hem and Haw. I do encourage anyone to read this- and don't think of it as Cheese.....it can be any situation or problem you have in your life.	2001-08-28

When I first started this book I liked the short chapters.  Then I became completely confused with all the characters that had similar names that were introduced in all the beginning chapters. Sometimes it was alittle difficult to try to think &quot;who was this,&quot; now?  Anyway, I loved the concept of the mystery, but it became alittle &quot;anti-climatic&quot; towards the end.  I would have liked a few more &quot;twists&quot; to the story.<br />I am not completely ruling out this author, I want to read another one of her books to get a &quot;feel&quot; for her writing.<br />I do have to say, I did read it in a few short days, which is good for me,  I usually take alot longer to read a book with over three hundred pages.

The cover was funny and I really had no idea what it meant.<br />I started to read the book at morning breakfast and continued almost finishing until lunch.<br />I loved it!  I cried when I read the very first story about the author's mother accompanying her daughter on a &quot;road trip&quot; and  every town she went to and saw things, and talking to people, she said in every town.  &quot; This is the best day of my life!!!&quot;  I don't know that we could say that anymore.<br />The author has you look at some &quot;insignificant&quot; things that happend to us in everyday life, that are a gift or message from God.  When they first happen you cannot imagine that this is the message, but when the author explains things you can feel how your life would mirror gifts in your life.<br />This was a easy read, and most enjoyable.  I urge everyone to read it and take a closer look at how they perceive their life and their relationship with God and themselves.<br />EMW	2001-07-03

This is the first book that I have read from this author and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I loved how she wrote the characters and their feelings toward every day life things that would happen to them.<br />I was disappointed  with the ending, I felt the book was very well narrated that the end left  me with questions and a feeling of unfulfillment.	2000-05-29
