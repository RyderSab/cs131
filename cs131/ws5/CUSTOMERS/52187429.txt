This book is one of the best guides I know to why the Democratic Party, as presently constituted, can NOT be trusted anywhere NEAR the levers of power. While it also includes a history of Democratic Party corruption going back to the founding of Tammany Hall, at almost the beginning of the Republic, this indispensible volume ALSO shows how the Dems have moved steadily Leftward since the late 1960's. <br />This book will no doubt be given a number of terrible reviews by Democrats, and other Leftists, but these may be safely ignored as the partisan &quot;sour grapes&quot; they are.	2004-07-16

One of the best Civil War counterfactuals I've read in SOME time, and that's saying something!<br />One of the improvements (one of the MANY) over the same authors' \\"1945\\" is that they resisted the temptation to mix fictional and factual characters in an historical setting--something which is NOT a good idea.<br />I also liked the fact that they avoided Sci-Fi touches (like the time travelling Afrikaaners of Turtledove's \\"Guns of the South\\")<br />This is a book well worth your time and money!	2003-06-05

This book is the story of how one man fought the Soviet Union for most of his adult life, entering politics to bring them down--and doing it! The documentation from the old Soviet and East Bloc Secret Police archives, as well as top secret directives of our OWN Government, recently declassified, lend a measure of veracity to the story that only the most determined Reagan-bashers could deny! HIGHLY recommended!	2002-11-03

This book is a wonderful defense of the Pre-Trib view of prophecy. Mr. LaHaye goes into all the Scriptural justifications for holding this view, while at the same time defending it from the attacks of those who DON'T hold it, particularly Dave McPherson, whose books attacking the Pre-Trib Rapture view have a number of flaws in their arguments. At the same time, Mr LaHaye reviews, and Scripturally refutes, the other views of eschatology (end-times prophecy). I recommend this book.	2002-07-22

I am, perhaps, in a better position than earlier reviewers here, to evaluate the accuracy of Bill Sammon's reporting, inasmuch as he covered politics for my hometown paper, The Cleveland Plain Dealer, some years back. (And in case there are those who want to label the PD a part of the VRWC, you should know that the paper endorsed Bill Clinton twice.) I have known Bill Sammon for all that time as a tough but fair, and very accurate, reporter. He has the credentials for investigative political journalism, as corrupt politicians of BOTH parties in this town could tell you! <br />So it would behoove the reader to take what he says seriously, and not simply dismiss it out of hand, just because of your political leanings.	2001-05-05

I'm pleased that a book has been written giving the Founder's view of the right to keep and bear arms. I am somewhat less pleased with the review  left by &quot;Reader from the United States&quot;, who didn't bother  attempting to refute the arguments in the book, but made references to  court decisions (which courts--and when?), and making insulting references  to &quot;rednecks&quot; and &quot;yahoos&quot;.
