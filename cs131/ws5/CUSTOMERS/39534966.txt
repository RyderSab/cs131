Although this story has a totally different feel to it than Swan Place, I loved how she wrote about living in a small southern town and the friendships that every ones strives for in their life.<br /><br />When Love Devine passed away she left a large bit of money to the local library and a piece of land to her dear friends which was the location of the bird sanctuary that Beulah, Zion, Sweet, Wildwood, and Memphis cared so much about. Although the women were sad about the passing of Love Devine,  they treasured the land and were proud of the after school program at the library that the money was funding.<br /><br />All that changed once a crooked retired New York judge came to town with a hidden agenda to get his hands on the money left to the library and to develop the quiet southern town. He quickly charmed his way onto the library board and town council, but even worse was the fact that he married Sweet and kept her hidden away from her friends while abusing her.<br /><br />When Beulah and Zion take matters into their own hands, these church going, polite southern woman, start living by the theory \\"you do what you need to do\\" and plan a way to exterminate the judge.<br /><br />The Tea Olive Bird Watching Society is a great story about friendship and the lengths that people will go to when push comes to shove. The Tea Olive Bird Watching Society was a pure delight to read and I just wish I would have had more time to gulp this one down.	2005-07-25

I happen to be in the loved it catagory.<br /><br />Jess is celebrating her 34 birthday and at this stage in her life she would love to find the right man to settle down with and start a family but to no avail. As a gift, one of her friends signs her up for an online dating service.

It is also a smart and not always funny look into the life of the average woman and not just about a 30 year old single desperate to find the love of her life.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Jennifer Weiner or Jane Green, and have not tried Jane Moore yet you might want to give this book a whirl.

The story was very good at the start and then seriously slowed down when we got to the war. It was hard to follow at times, and I certainly did not read anything that was laugh out loud funny. This was a serious story about family dysfunction and the effects of war.<br /><br />I honestly found myself skimming the book towards the middle and end just to be let down in the last two chapters. Talk about a quick ending.<br /><br />If you want to read a good book by this author, try More Than You Know.	2005-06-05

The problems start when Mac is unable to come to terms with his past and cant open his heart to Wynter. When he suddenly takes off for Alaska leaving Wynter behind to pick up the pieces her world starts to fall apart. Her bakers apprentice moves in with her after her best friend over dosed, the bakery has to close its doors, and Wyns best friend in moving back to LA.<br /><br />I personally thought that Bread Alone was a better book only because The Bakers Apprentice moved along very slowly towards the middle of the book. I think it could have been made about 100 pages shorter and would have been much better.<br /><br />The Bakers Apprentice is the continuing story of Wynter and Mac from Bread Alone and although it is not necessary to read Bread Alone first, it would help you in understanding the characters history.	2005-05-24

As more information is found out about Nat, the better the story becomes. You cant help but love all the characters in Pawleys Island and fight for the underdog.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Dorothea Benton Frank you will not be let down with her newest effort in Low Country Tales. Pawleys Island ranked right up there with Isle of Palms as my favorite DBF story. I suggest you grab this book, a tall glass of ice tea, and a comfortable chair.

Since then, I have read each one of her books and I can certainly say that with each new book this author is maturing.<br /><br />In The Other Woman, Jane Green takes on the marriage of Ellie and Dan. Ellie lost her mother when she was a very young child so she always wanted to have a close knit family and a mother figure. When it seemed like Ellie and Dan were serious, she met Dans family for the first time and although they seemed dysfunctional to her, Ellie could also tell that they loved each other very much.<br /><br />Ellie and Dan started off their courtship and marriage on the right foot but once the problems of a grown up life got in the way, the marriage started taking some very wrong turns. They suddenly had some serious issues to deal and the biggest strain was Linda. She forced herself into every aspect of their marriage included their baby, Tom. As much as Ellie liked Linda, she also needed Dan to stand up for her and make Linda back off but her would not do it.<br /><br />The Other Woman is a novel that does not make marriage look like a walk in the park. It deals with some serious issues but is disguised in a great story. Jane Green, keep them coming.	2005-05-03

She has been burned one too many times by falling in love with the wrong man.<br /><br />Put those two characters together and a weak back drop story about mysterious lights in the Boone Creek cemetary that could be ghosts and you have True Believer. Nothing exciting, and nothing that makes you want to turn the pages except to reach the ending.<br /><br />I am willing to bet that if you are a Sparks fan, you wont mind reading the story but my best advice is to wait until it comes out in paperback.

Although the story went back and forth in time it was very easy to follow and understand. My one complaint would be that the last chapter tied the whole story up too fast.<br /><br />I think that Joshilyn Jackson is going to be an author to watch. I will gladly read another one of her books.	2005-04-25

It is your regular Anytown, USA diner where truckers are eating burgers, salesmen are reading the papers, and waitresses are writing down orders. Violet soon invites us to sit down for a cup of coffee while she tells us a story about miracles and love.<br /><br />Violet had a hard depressing childhood. Her mother deserted her when she was just a child and her father was physically and verbally abusive. Rebelling against everything her mother told her not to do, Violet went without using soap, bit her fingernails, didn't brush her hair, and slept in her clothes. For those reasons plus many more she was tormented by the town people and other kids.<br /><br />Violet spent much of her time alone reading and learning until one day her father told her to get a job instead of sitting around all day doing nothing. Violet was hired at the thread factory where she finally got to experience something she never had before, friendship. The days spent there were some of the best times but it quickly ended when she was involved in an \\"incedent\\" which caused her to lose an arm. Violet could not take life the way is was any more so she decided to clear out her bank account, take a bus across the country, and jump off the San Francisco bridge.

These two men who where stuggling musicians took her in on their journey to fortune and fame and made her a part of their life and the pursuit to make their own special kind of music.<br /><br />Oh My Stars is not a bright and funny kind of story like Lorna Landvik has written in the past but it sure is worth the time it takes to read it. This story deals with some serious issues such as abuse and racism but it also has love and hope and shows that miracles can happen. You can't help cheering on Violet as she makes her way through this book.<br /><br />I'ts about time Lorna Landvik wrote a new book and Oh My Stars will not disappoint you. Enjoy!happen.

I am going to go out on a limb and say I was not overly thrilled with The Feast Of Roses. Yes, I did enjoy the over all story about Mehrunnisa and Jahangir but each chapter began with a short history lesson and there were paragraphs upon paragraphs about the politics not the couple.

They were so involved in each others day to day lives<br />that they rarely had the time for anyone else. They dreamed of leaving Boston and starting over in the midwest by opening up a little store but their plans changed when John was diagnosed with cancer. Before John passed away, he convinced Betta that she should follow through on their plans and make the move. He believed that she would be stong enough to keep living.<br /><br />Shortly after Johns death, Betta did just as he wished by getting in her car and driving. Following the country back roads, she ended up stopping in a small town outside of Chicago that felt right to her. Betta found a house, and slowly started making new friends and also reconnected with three lost friends from her college days.<br /><br />The Year of Pleasures is more than a book about the death of a spouse, it is about the life that we must learn to live afterwards. It is about doing one thing each day that brings you happiness instead of dwelling on grief.<br /><br />Elizabeth Berg has written some wonderful books like The Art of Mending and True to Form but in my honest opinion, I think this is her best one to date. It is so heartfelt and Betta is so endearing. I will give you a warning though, I got misty eyed a few times by reading this one so have a tissue or two ready.	2005-04-13

Sue Monk Kidd has definitely turned into one of my favorite southern fiction authors and I am looking forward to more of her books.	2005-04-12

The House Next Door. Walter and Colquitt lived a pretty quiet life. They had good jobs, a nice house, and friends. That all changed one day when the empty lot next to their house was sold and a young couple was going to move in right after the new house was built. Right from the start strange unexplained things were happening and Colquitt and Walter start to believe that the house is \\"haunted\\".

Little did she know the consequences that wish would have, because her mother was killed that night in a car crash. The young girl and her brother Ned go to live with their grandmother.<br /><br />The story quickly moves on and we find that the young girl is now a grown woman working at the local library and her brother has moved from NJ to Florida. The woman leads a lonely life with no love or friendship. She believes she is made of ice with no feelings. When the grandmother dies, Ned makes arrangements for her to move to Florida to be closer to him where he is a teacher at a local college. During the drive down to Florida, the woman makes another wish ...  that she would be stuck by lightening. A short time after her arrival, her wish came true. From then on the story becomes strange because we meet a whole group of lightening survivors and one in particular that caught the attention of the woman. His name is Lazarus. Now while the woman believes she is made of ice, Lazarus burns like the sun. They soon start an affair that has startling results.<br /><br />I really am not sure how to rate The Ice Queen because the story left me hot and cold so to speak. It was an interesting storyline but I also found it strange at the same time. The character development was wonderful and it was an easy book to read but something just was not pulling me into the story like I had hoped. I have not read other Alice Hoffman books so I don't have much to compare this one too. I guess if you are a fan of hers I would suggest you give this one a try.	2005-03-30

All that changed one day when the police came to the home that she shared with her father and charged him with kidnapping. We begin to learn that Delias father took her away from Arizona one weekend during a court appointed visitation. Delia must face the past and come to terms with the fact that her father kidnapped her, her mother was an alchoholic, and as Delia begins to have flashbacks, she must also face the truth of what really happened 28 years before.<br /><br />Vanishing Acts really shows many different relationships between father and daughter and mother and daughter and gives you plenty to think about. It also shows what happens when the past you thought was buried comes to the surface when you least expect it.	2005-03-11

The first book is No Angel and the third book is Into Temptation.<br /><br />In No Angel, the novel mainly centered around Lady Celia and Oliver Lytton and how their story began but in Something Dangerous the saga continued with the younger generation in the midst of war with Germany. Many of the characters you will see are Giles, Venetia, Adele, and Kit who are the children of Oliver and Celia. Barty, the woman that Celia took in as a child, Jay their nephew, and Izzy, the daughter of their prized author. Through these people you will see affairs, love, marriage, children, and death. What more could you ask for?<br /><br />I am sure many of you have never heard of Penny Vencenzi before but if you are a fan of the big family sagas then I would highly suggest you give her a try.	2005-02-17

I had The Kite Runner in my hands at the book store and library more times than I would like to admit and some how it never made it home until a few weeks ago. I really had a feeling that the story would be hard to follow because it was about the Taliban and Afghanistan but I was wrong. Granted, there were a few words and phrases that I did not get but the story was certainly easy enough to follow. I found parts of the book to be a bit choppy and wordy but over all a very good read.<br /><br />I am not going to give another recap of the story because there are certainly enough reveiws of The Kite Runner here but I will say that I am very glad that I finally read this book and if you are having doubts about it, give it a try. You just might be surprised.	2005-02-14

Everyone around them knew that some day they would fall in love and end up spending the rest of their lives together but it took over thirty years to get it right. With Rosie and Alex we learn that timing is everything. Missed opportunities and understandings, marriage, divorce, children, all seem to stand in the way of the inevitable.<br /><br />Written in letter, email, post card and telephone passages Rosie Dunne really could have been a much better book. It took the entire 400+ pages  for these two people to get together and from time to time I just wanted to reach out and slap Rosie and Alex and say \\"wake up and smell the coffee\\".<br /><br />If you are looking for an easy read with a happy ending, Rosie Dunne will do the job. Just dont expect to be wowed.	2005-02-04

Claudia was being hounded by the newspapers and photographers so she decided to leave London and head off to the small Dorset village of Court Barton to start a new life. She changed her name to Claudia Knight, rented a small cottage, and got a job at a local school as a cook. She is trying hard to keep her past life a secret but circumstances beyond her control are forcing the truth out.<br /><br />Blackthorn Winter is a special treat to read if you are a fan of Maeve Binchy or Rosamunde Pilcher. The first chapter is a little bit confusing because of how it opens but stick to it, you will not be sorry.	2005-01-21

She is an up and coming attorney living in Florida who is twice divorced, does not like losing cases, and thinks it is ok to sleep with married men.<br /><br />Out of the blue, her first ex husband Ben calls from Toronto to tell her that her estranged mother has been arrested for shooting a stranger in the Four Season Hotel and he would like her to come home to help. After much deliberation and some extra heat from past relationships knocking at her door, Amanda decided to take a quick trip home. Ben takes Amanda to see her mother the day after she arrives only to be told that her mom, Gwen does not want any kind of defense. She just wants to plead guilty and take her sentence. Being the attorney that she is, Amanda can't take that as an option so she starts digging around to find out the truth behind the shooting. What Amanda gets is a whole lot more than she bargained for when the truth about her past starts catching up to her and life will never be the same.<br /><br />Puppet was a very quick read with a lot of dialog so be forewarned if you do not like that format in a book. For those of you who have read many of Joy Fieldings past books you will not be surprised to know that she once again throughs in a zinger that you would not have originally guessed and thats all I am saying.	2005-01-19

In Leaving Ireland, Gracelin is a fugitive from the law after being accused of murder. To save herself, she must run away to America to be with her brother Sean.

They suffer many weeks of sickness and death to reach America but Gracelin does survive. She meets up with her brother and begins her new life but cant stop being haunted by the memory of what and who she left behind.<br /><br />I thought that Leaving Ireland was just an OK story. It took about half the book just to get Gracelin across to America. Once she arrived, it seemed as though the story had no real purpose and was then I was rushed to reach the end.<br /><br />I am however looking forward to the third and final book due out very soon, til Morning Light. I am hoping for the magic of the tale that I enjoyed in the first book.	2005-01-10

The story took off very slowly and it took about 100 pages to really get interesting and then it ended too fast. If Mark Mills would have just stuck to the murder mystery I believe that I would have given the novel a higher rating but there was a story within a story going on that was just plain uninteresting.	2005-01-06

Snowed In tells the story of Sophia and Paul, a newly married couple who left the big bustling city of Washington D.C. and moved to the quiet and very cold Portland, Maine for Pauls new job. Sophie was hoping that the change would be good for the marriage but the longer they were in Portland, the more it seemed that Paul was pulling away from her. Sophie believed that if she made herself more interesting to Paul, the sparks would return in the marriage so she started making a list of how to improve herself. Her first task was to join a walking group, then she moved on to a new hair cut with color and then a car. With each day, she was becoming a more independent woman but Paul was even more distant with her. We finally find out that Paul was having an affair with an associate from work but by the time Sophie found out, she was well on her way to becoming a new woman who could stand on her own two feet.<br /><br />Although I was not immediately blown away when I started Snowed In, little by little the story engaged my interest and I found myself routing for Sophie to rise above the life that she was living and find the strength within herself to want and do more with her future. If you have looking to read a story that has action and a moment that changes everything, you will not find it in Snowed In. This is more of a book that slowly unfolds before your eyes. It is a book for the simple pleasure of reading.<br /><br />Christina Bartolomeo is a very talented author and is definitely one to watch in the coming years.	2004-12-27

I have cruised three times but was not sure where I wanted to visit next and which cruise line I wanted to take to get me there so I borrowed Cruises & Ports of Call 2005 from the library.  I spent the greater part of an afternoon studying cruise lines, ships, itineraries, and cabins. It immensely helped me choose which cruise was right for me because it went into a very detailed description of the ins and outs of each port and line out there.	2004-12-25

The story opens with Amber joining a class reunion group so she can attempt to hook up with Gray, the man that got away back in high school. He contacts her shortly after, and they begin an affair over the internet. Amber learns that Gray is living with someone and he is very committed to the womans child, so she is trying very hard not to get her hopes up about a future with him but it is not working. They have a real connection with each other. When Amber comes down with a form of cancer, she must make a decision about whether or not to involved Gray.<br /><br />Stephanie used to work with Amber before she married a hotel executive and moved away from Boston to Miami. Now Stephanie is in a marriage that is not fulfilling her life as much as she thought it would. Her husband Brent is always away and she has reason to believe that he is cheating on her. Tom, a married man that Stephanie was involved with before she hooked up with Brent contacted her about rejoining the advertising agency on a project that would be perfect for her. She could work at home and have a purpose to her life instead of just being a wife and mother. Through the constant contact with Tom, they too begin a relationship that Stephanie calls e-dultery and begins to wonder where the lines end from having some fun and actually committing adultery.<br /><br />Don't let the cover, title, and genre fool you. Hit Reply is much more than your average chick lit novel. It deals with some serious issues like cancer and adultery that will leave you laughing and crying. The friendships and relationships between these people are very realistic and make for a great read. I would also like to add that even though the entire book is written in email and IM format (which I normally no not like reading) somehow works with Hit Reply.	2004-12-10

That would have been bad enough, but because he was not there to pick her up it set off a terrible chain reaction of events. There was an explosion at the plant near by that sent deadly gas out into the air and Anjali was trapped. She almost died from the fumes. Even though she loved Prakash with all her heart, she left him.<br /><br />Now many years later, we find Anjali happily married to a wonderful man, Sandeep. Life is not all a bed of roses though. Anjali and Sandeeps son is very ill and will not live to become an adult. His lungs were damaged from the gases that Anjali breathed in that fateful night.<br /><br />While out at the local market, Anjali runs into Prakash, who is also remarried. This sends Anjali reminiscing at the past and the events that lead her to where she is right now and then coming to terms with Prakash and her divorce from him.<br /><br />A Breath Of  Fresh Air is a brilliant story that will transport you to another time and place and I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants to feel the story that they are reading.	2004-12-03

They had a nice home, two children that they loved dearly, and good careers at the local college but something vital was always missing between them.<br /><br />One day, a student of Carls came into his office and asked if he could change a lab day because he wanted to go home to North Carolina to visit a woman that was very close to the family that had suddenly taken ill.

It was time to meet up with his past and make peace with a secret he has been holding inside since he was a teenager.<br /><br />While he was gone, Olivia took the time to deal with her own past. Her first husband Noah was murdered and she was never able to deal with his death and move on the way she should have to allow Carl into her heart. With her mothers help Olivia takes a step back in time to remember and grieve for Noah, but then allow herself to love Carl the way she should.<br /><br />The Windmill is a beautifully written story about dealing with the loss of a loved one and then being able to open your heart and find love again. It is also about dealing with the past and the lies that we tell to cover it up.<br /><br />This book is going down as a Top 10 read for 2004. I just loved it and am looking forward to catching up on more books by Stepahanie Gertler.	2004-12-02

It seems as though her brother got himself into a bit of trouble and had to make a quick escape. Alex who expects wild escapades from her brother had a bad feeling about this one so she left the cold winter of Baltimore and hopped on a plane for sunny and warm Miami. When she got there her intuition was right, Bill was no where to be found and his apartment was broken into. While searching for Bill, she ran into Hooker, a rather famous NACSAR driver who likes to call himself NASCAR guy. He claimed that Bill stole his boat so he stays close to Alex. NASCAR guy and Alex grow closer and the sexual attraction is getting hard to deny but they stay focused looking for clues to find the boat and Bill.<br /><br />Metro Girl is a wild and sometimes funny chase with bad guys, good guys, and a strange group of would be helpers, but this book really could have been so much better. It seemed like Evanovich was rushing to get this one published to cash in on the popularity of the Plum series which in my opinion is where she should stick to writing. I did not feel the same connection with Alex and NASCAR guy as I do while reading about Stephanie, Ranger, and Morelli.	2004-11-09

Unfortunely, even though she redeemed herself a bit from Quentins, Nights Of Rain and Stars is no where near the quality of work you will get from reading Evening Class, Glass Lake, or Circle Of Friends. The writing was very choppy from time to time and I did not feel like I got the chance to know the main characters before the story began.

They immediately rush home to warm the baby and then take her to the hospital where she can be properly cared for. While there, the police question Robert about the incident but he is released.<br /><br />Days later as a snow storm is approaching, the mother of the baby comes to their home under the false pretense of looking for furniture, which Roberts makes in his barn. She eventually admits the truth about who she is, but by then it is too late for her to leave and Robert must make the decision of whether or not to turn her in to the authorities. He does not want anything to do with her but as they are faced with time alone, she tells him her side of story and his thoughts and feelings about her begin to change.<br /><br />Light On Snow is a very haunting story about the decisions we make and what consequences those decisions make on us, and others. The writing is simple to read for being such a complex story. This is the perfect book to curl up and read on a cold winters day.	2004-10-12

Her parents acted very strange when she showed up at their house and it turns out they had good reason. Becky has a step sister that she knew nothing about. She immediately dreams about shopping with this long lost sister but it turns out that Jess is very frugal and hates to shop.<br /><br />I was really expecting more laughs and fun with this book but Becky spent way to much time feeling sorry for her self because of her relationships with Luke, Jess, and Suze.

Normally that would not have been a problem, but she is about to marry the son of the woman that Wood had never gotten over before he married Milan. Once she comes back into their lives, Wood starts up an affair that has consequences that he is forced to deal with.<br /><br />The problem I had with the book was the fact that this storyline was buried underneath a bunch of other plots going on with the local friends of Wood and Milan that had nothing to do with the problem they were facing with their marriage.<br /><br />As a woman who was a fan of Designing Woman, I really had high hopes for this book but was let down. If the author would just have stuck to the main story, Liberating Paris would have gotten a much higher rating.	2004-10-06

Rachel and Darcy have been best friends since childhood but Darcy always had a way of being just a bit better than Rachel. Darcy got the boys, the career, and now the fianc&eacute;.<br /><br />On the night before Rachel's 30 birthday, Darcy and her fianc&eacute; Dex meet with her and a few other friends to celebrate. After too many drinks, Darcy heads off to home to sleep it off and leaves Dex with Rachel. The two of them drink some more and end up at Rachels house kissing and them ultimately end up in bed. The next morning, during the light of day, neither Dex, nor Rachel seemed to have much remorse for what happened but they said it would not happen again. Of course, they could not seem to stay away from each other and the affair continued. As the days turned into weeks, Rachel could not help but wonder if the wedding was going to take place but she was afraid to even mention it to Dex until the wedding was just weeks away.<br /><br />I would not normally enjoy rooting for a woman to take away a fianc&eacute; from her best friend but I could not help but cheer on Rachel in her quest for Dex. Darcy is a liar, and does not deserve to be married to someone like Dex.<br /><br />Something Borrowed was a fun easy to read story that was hard to put down. It was not<br /><br />what I would call your normal chick lit book because it did not have a whiny 30 something woman is search of the perfect man. Rachel was just a down to earth woman in search of the love of her life.	2004-09-16

Once she was married, her husband did the same thing because he wanted a proper woman who acted the way a woman of the upper class should act. With no way to live out her dreams, Lucy suffered from hysteria and was not able to conceive a child. William sent her to many doctors to help her but nobody could until Victor Seth came into the picture. He was a neurologist that used hypnosis to help women with nerve problems. His treatment was unkown and criticized, but they were willing to try as a last resort before sending Lucy to the asylum. Victor made great strides with the treatment of Lucy and in the process they became involved with each other. Lucy was cured, but then she became an \\"inconvenience\\" to William because he could no longer control her. When William found out what was going on between Lucy and Victor he sent her away against her wishes which brought on a chain of events that has serious repercussions.<br /><br />I found Megan Chance when she published Susannah Morrow and I really enjoyed it so I figured I would try An Inconvenient Wife too. Megan is a very talented author that has the rare ability to bring you into a story and keep you there right to the end.	2004-09-10

Now, her youngest brother is finally getting ready to head off to college in just a matter of months. When that happens, Nina can finally escape and travel the world like she always dreamed about.<br /><br />Joey is Ninas best friend since childhood. They were always there for each other no matter what happened. Nina was there for him the night his fianc&eacute; changed her mind about getting married and decided to become a nun and Joey was there for Nina when her father was ill.<br /><br />Joey does not see if life going the way he expected and now wants nothing more than to be a father. He goes to Nina and asks her if she would have his child for him with no strings attached. At first, Nina said no.  She did not want to have anything to do with bearing a child and was afraid she would be tied down. After some convincing and thought, Nina changes her mind and goes for it. She told Joey that she would have his baby for him.<br /><br />Nina would be leaving within a few months, so they did not have time to go the red tape of clinical insemination, they needed to create this baby the old fashioned way by sleeping together. That act dredges up strong feelings that Joey or Nina don't want to admit to themselves or each other.<br /><br />The Nine Month Plan was a cute story but the biggest complaint I would have is that as you are reading a conversation, you also have to read about what they are really thinking, not just saying.	2004-08-31

I am normally a fan of the Biblical Fiction books such as The Red Tent and The Queenmaker but Sarah did not live up to my expectations. Unlike the two books I previously mentioned, Marek Halters writing in Sarah was very choppy which made the story hard to follow.  He would skip years at a time between major events in her life, which left me confused and wondering what happened to get us from point A to point B.

Very rarely can you find an author who can write about such unsavory subject matter as rape, kidnapping, attempted murder, adultery, child abuse, abortions, and mental illness and yet still have the ability to keep you wanting to turn the page to find out how the story is going to end.

My Sisters Keeper has gotten so many great reviews here I was not sure if I was even going to do one, but figured, why not. This book deserves it.<br /><br />Anna was genetically created for the sole purpose of being a stem cell donor for her sister Kate who was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia. That one time donation turned into several more procedures to help prolong the life of Kate. Now that Anna is 13 we find out that she needs to give up one of her kidneys for Kate. Anna does not want to do it and she wants a say over what happens to her body. She goes to a lawyer, Campbell Alexander, to sue her parents for rights to her own body.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Anna's parents are split on their opinions on this matter. The mother, Sara is a former lawyer herself who has taken on the case to make sure that Anna gives up her kidney. Her father, Brian changes course and surprisingly is supporting Anna. Anna brother Jessy, is also involved in the story but as an outsider looking in because he is the forgotten child.<br /><br />Although there was an ending that I did not like, and made most of the story pointless, it was a wonderful ride getting there. Get your tissues ready, you are going to need them.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult is a hit or miss author for me. Sometimes I like her books  (The Pact and Salem Falls) and other times they do not fare so well (Keeping Faith and Mercy). After reading My Sisters Keeper in about two sittings, I have to say that this is the best book Jodi Picoult has written.<br /><br />I was immediately taken into this story and my heart broke for everyone involved because it is impossible to takes sides when there can be no feasible winner.<br /><br />My Sisters Keeper is also told in varying narratives so that we learn the story from different points of view. I normally am not a fan of this style of writing, but it was done very well, and I had no problem figuring out which person was speaking.<br /><br />In conclusion, I loved this book. It was heartwarming and real and am now looking forward to Picoults next book.to Picoults next book.	2004-08-18

Keeley proceeds to throw a major hissy fit, cancels the wedding, storms off, and starts the humiliating long walk home. Along the way, a friendly stranger appears and offers her more than just a ride home.  Will offers her a job to decorate the mansion he just bought. It will not be an easy task though, he wants the house to attract the woman he loves, make her fall in love with him, and the house. The crazy part is the fact that Will has not even met the love of his life in person. He only saw her on a local telethon. Keeley does not want to take the job but she has no choice. The family and friends of AJ parents were slowly backing out of decorating deals leaving Keeley with bills to pay and no income.<br /><br />I have read Mary Kay Andrews past two novels, Savannah Blues and Little Bitty Lies and enjoyed both of them very much and was so looking forward to the newest book by Mary Kay Andrews. With Hissy Fit, I am sorry to say that I was a bit disappointed. The storyline would have been a great, fun, idea if she would have stuck to it. Unfortunately, Ms. Andrews got carried away with about 100 extra pages of antique shopping which bored me to tears. I found myself skimming chapters to reach the end of the book. I am not going to give up on Mary Kay Andrews, I would be more than willing to buy another book by her.	2004-08-17

Linda has more than one job and they are going nowhere, a daughter about to head off to college, and another daughter who has been in a lot of trouble lately so she decides to return home and start her life over in the simple, laid back Low Country.<br /><br />Brad Jackson, is estranged from his wife. He left the big city of Atlanta, and his son Alex, to open a restaurant along the Shem Creek called Jacksons Hole. With no prior restaurant experience, Linda applies and gets a job managing there.<br /><br />Shem Creek is another story of a woman being dumped by her husband and subsequently running off to start her life over again with her children in tow. I am a huge fan of DBF but Shem Creek was a let down for two big reasons. First, the narration was hard to follow because different chapters were told by different characters and it took a bit of time to figure out which person was talking. Second, when I read DBF books, I feel like I am right there in the Low Country with the characters, and I did not feel that way with Shem Creek. The story could have taken place anywhere.<br /><br />Overall, Shem Creek was an OK book and I still can't wait to read more by DBF.	2004-08-16

She has a way of writing about the truest of emotions that other authors just don't have the capability of doing. I especially love the stories that take place in Hubbards Point because we occasionally get the chance to catch up with past characters from other books.

After being so disappointed with Delinskys last book Flirting With Pete I was not sure if I wanted to read The Summer I Dared but I am glad that I did. It is a wonderfully written story about what happens after we are faced with a life altering incident. In The Summer I Dared you will meet three very important people Julia, Noah, and Kim - the only survivors of a ferry accident that killed nine others. As you watch these three charactors live through the pain and guilt of being the only survivors, you will be asking yourself... What if something like this happened to me?	2004-06-29

Queen Bee Of Mimosa Branch is the story of Lin Breedlove Scott, a recenty divorced woman who high tails it back to her hometown after 30 years to re-group and get on with her life after her husband leaves her for a stripper and in trouble with the IRS. While back home in Mimosa Branch, Georgia, she gets involved with a politcal campaign to remove the current Mayor and replace him with a local preacher. Lin also takes up with Grant, a man that she does not particularly like but uses to get back into the dating pool again.<br />My favorite parts of the book happen to have been about Lins off the wall family.. her mother Miss Mamie, her father the General, her Uncle Bedford, and her Aunt Gloria.<br />Queen Bee of Mimosa Branch started off light and funny but took a quick nose dive with uninteresting story lines and charactors.	2002-10-08

Swan Place is the story of Dove, an almost 14 year old girl who has a tough road ahead of her. Doves loving Mamas death causes her to be the one left to take care of her two younger siblings, Molly and Little Ellis while her step-father is out working double shifts and clubbing at the local honky tonk. Dove was raised right by her mama and stands up to the challenges ahead of her including having a new step-mother who is only a few years older than Dove herself, children making fun of her at school for wearing second hand clothes, and a secret about her true parentage.<br />Trombough has a wonderful flow to her writing that just draws you into this story and doesn't let go even once you are finished. This is a must read for all the southern fiction and coming of age readers out there.	2002-09-30
