As an anthology, as the other reviewer has ably mentioned, this is wonderful.  This book would be extremely useful to the student of Christian theology (Roman Catholic or Protestant) or to the student of historical philosophy.  If you are studying the works of Aquinas for history, a few words of caution.  A lot of his philosophy is based on Aristotle.  If you do not understand basic Aristotle, this can be painful at times. \\"Actualize\\" and \\"potential\\" and sufficient causes, etc. will appear a lot.  If you are unfamiliar with what this terminology means, you will have slow going.  This is just a problem with some philosophy.  Kant, another member of the big-5 team of greatest philosophers, also suffers from a language barrier to modern readers.  But like Kant, you can still get a lot out of it.<br />The editor of this book has put in a lot of useful and wonderful theology of Aquinas.  This is good b/c not many people believe in his metaphysics anymore.  So his theology may have more modern usefullness.  Given his influence over Western Christianity and Roman Catholicism in particular, Aquinas is definitely worth the read.  One of the small gems (and unexpected) was a part of Aquinas' commentary on I Cor. 15.  Sections on the Problem of Evil are in here as well.  I was surprised, but glad, to see that the editor left in a section on the problem of using language to describe God.  This was a typical 20th century problem.  It's good to see that there aren't many new philosophical problems.<br />If you are just getting into Aquinas (and you have some background in philosophy) this is a good place to start.  If you are interested in theology, there is much in here for you as well.  Given the structure of the book, you do not have to read straight through.	2003-01-16
US	52439747	R30Z29RYFGPWFD	087552186X	342464324	Given for You: Reclaiming Calvin's Doctrine of the Lord's Supper	Books	5	51	51	N	N	Another Great Book from Dr. Mathison	Dr. Keith Mathison has produced an excellent followup to his last excellent work, the Shape of Sola Scriptura.  Like that work, this book is concerned with recovering the richness of doctrine from the Reformation.  Here, the author is recovering, defending, and defining Calvin's view of the Eucharist.  Calvin's view involves the Real Presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper.  Since he doesn't fall into transubstantiation Roman Catholics will think he denies the Real Presence.  Since most Protestants (including the Reformed) deny any sort of Real Presence, this will seem weird at best, Romish at worst.<br />This book fits into a general category I would call &quot;the catholic Reformed&quot; movement.  There is a significant and growing number of people who are Reformed but at the same time more broadly catholic. In other words, they are connected to and give consideration to the church prior to the Reformation.  Also, the catholic Reformed (and some others) have views closer to the original Reformers than many modern Reformed, although these two groups still share a lot in common.  There are a variety of reasons for this, but this book cannot be understood apart from this context.<br />This book is written primarily for those who are Reformed, so all can recover the richness of Calvin's doctrine.  Almost immediately into the book, Dr. Matthison covers the original Reformed Eucharistic beliefs and how a divergence from those beliefs came about.  If you are not Reformed, would you care about this? Probably not.  If you are arguing about fidelity to the Westminster Confessions, etc., this matters.  <br />Dr. Matthison then goes on to give a biblical defense of his position.  He also critiques other views.  He gives a wonderful, but short, critique of the Roman Catholic position.  He also wonderfully highlights the significance of the Passover meal in a way that supports his position.  In the appendix he covers Eucharistic views from the Didache to Aquinas, and that section is most helpful and useful.<br />Lastly, Dr. Mathison covers controversial practical issues like the use of wine and padeocommunion.  <br />If you are Reformed, this book is a must.  If you want to understand the Lord's Supper better, it is also a must.  This book will be useful in general.  This book is a gift and should be read and bought.	2002-12-31

US	52439747	R2SZQ9FDJ3YB0	0764222880	383769649	The God Who Justifies	Books	5	12	14	N	N	Wonderful Exegesis, Wonderful Work, Lots of Info	James White's work is definitely the best treatment on this subject I've read in a long time.  It is indeed two books in one.  The first part is an explanation of the evangelical doctrine and its importance.  The second part is thorough exegesis of relevant passages.<br />James White, in the first part, has hit the nail on the head with this issue.  Error on this doctrine is an extension of another doctrine.  When we misunderstand the holiness of God (please, please read the Sproul book of the same name), we misunderstand how to get right with God.  That's what justification is about.  How we get right with God.  When we understand God is holy, we understand that He must judge sin.  We understand that God He can't overlook our bad deeds.  Then we should realize that good deeds won't overcome our past bad deeds, since we already owe God good deeds.  I won't keep going on this tangent.  Suffice it to say, that this is the key issue to understand which undergirds the rest of the issue.<br />The second part of the book capitalizes on James White's strength, very complete exegesis.  He does not have the space to do this for every passage that pertains to the topic, Acts of the Apostles and the four Gospels have been left out for instance.  However, a lot of Romans and James 2 are in there.  They are the main passages that pertain to this topic.  White clearly shows that justification by faith alone is taught by Paul.  He touches on &quot;works of the law.&quot;  I've seen better James 2 commentaries (Matthew Henry comes to mind), but White does a very good job.  The second part is a lot like his treatment of John 1 in &quot;the Forgotten Trinity.&quot;  He will use a lot of Greek.  I do not know coine Greek, but I was able to follow along quite well.  He discusses any issues with textual variants along the way.  This is a most rewarding treatment of Scriptures!<br />All in all, it is an excellent resource.  Once I got to the second section, I started using it as a Biblestudy.  You would go through a section of Scripture, and then James White would be your commentator.	2001-10-15

Needless to say, this book is about clarifying the relationship between Scritpture and tradition; clarifying what sola scriptura actually is, saving the doctrine from Rome and from modern evangelicals in a balanced, historical perspective.<br />Mr. Mathison has done the church quite a service.  For those who hate the authority of the church and for those who elevate the church above Scripture, this will not be a popular book.  It will produce a lot of dialogue, I hope, but it won't sit well.  <br />The book is methodical in its historical overview of the role of Scripture.  Many things will become apparant from this book: 1) Sola Scriptura or Tradition I(as it is in the book) is the early church's position 2) numerous (and I mean numerous) examples of the fallibility of infallible Roman Catholicism are on display in this book. Rome is ruled by the magesterium of the moment.  Since they are assumed to be infallible, they cannot be corrected.  Even though any reasonable unbiased person can see that some of their current positions are not ones the church has held in the past. Although, in the end, it is admitted that Rome is part of the visible church. 3) The individualistic notions in modern evangelicalism is really really bad.  Too much of the Anabaptists and not enough of the Reformers.<br />Along the way, Mr. Mathison deals with objections and raises many issues.  This is highly deserving of his five stars.  It is time to place Scripture, tradition, and the church in its proper and historical place.  Towards that end, we should pray.  And towards that end, I highly recommend this book.	2001-07-26
US	52439747	R11F6ZB87JLLQS	0809127024	262804191	The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism (STUDIES IN JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY)	Books	5	29	33	N	N	standard and great intro	This book covers the facts of the history of antisemitism, but it does much much more than that as well.  It tries to provide analysis, both big-picture and small-picture analysis.  Big picture wise, especially in the last chapter, Flannery tries to figure out the why's of the history of antisemitism.  Each chapter generally covers a certain period of antisemitism, and Flannery attempts to analyize these smaller periods as well.  He does a fairly balanced and good job at that, but he is not dogmatic.  He understands that many of these issues are complex.<br />One of the more interesting points that Flannery picked up on was that the relationship between church and synagogue was strained from the outset, when Christians were primarily Jewish.  It should be mentioned at this point that this book is geared towards other Christians and that shows through.  Flannery himself is a Catholic priest.<br />I do have a few critiques, but they are minor.  I am just going to say right now that not many within this field agree with my views.<br />Flannery touches on the fact that Christianity is Jewish in origin.  This is important because many in this field state that Christianity and the New Testament contain, inherently, antisemitism.  However, if one places the faith in its original context, this view doesn't hold water.  While antisemites have used the New Testament to support their views, they have also used the Old Testament Scriptures as well.  This comes up a lot in this field.  I wish Flannery drove the point home instead of dancing around it.  Flannery does not ignore this issue though.  It is pretty obvious when rabid atheists are rabid antisemites that the issue is complex.  Here comes my controversial point.  He seems to miss the forest for the trees.  So many different antisemites in so many different contexts.  It seems to have a demonic cause, in a literal sense.<br />The book does not address modern evangelism, the Messianic Jewish movement, etc.  That's a big whole.<br />Flannery while understanding the role of replacement theology in Christian circles as a cause of antisemitism misses the mark when he deals with the Judaizing heresy.  This heresy is mentioned in Acts and was dealt with by Paul in some of his letters.  The gospel states that we are saved by faith in Jesus.  The Judaizers added works, specifically adherence to the Mosaic Law, to faith.  They said we are righteous before God by faith and adherence to Torah.  Stick with me this is important.  Gentiles come along add see &quot;Judaizers.&quot;  They assume it means anyone who practices Jewish stuff in the church commits this heresy.  (Paul goes to synagogue, the Temple, etc. btw.)  This is a wrong view.  Flannery does not pick up on this. Catholics, from my perspective, do this as well, just not with the Mosaic Law.  Because of this, I feel Flannery missed this issue.  This is a very complex issue.  I suggest reading Faith Alone by R.C. Sproul for a Protestant but balanced perspective on it.<br />All in all, the book is wonderful and a must read.	2001-06-07

The interlinear translation style is extremely wonderful resource, esp. for people trying to pick up the language or to see the underlying Hebrew.  The Rashi commentary is easy to follow.  All the texts are well laid-out and extremely readable.  I find the resource valuable for helping someone pick up Hebrew.  The translation is more word for word than thought for thought, but that is appropriate in this context, given that it is an interlinear translation.  Rashi adds valuable insights.  His text being there in Hebrew and English is done just as well as the Torah text.  The use of a the more readable font for the Hebrew is easier for people like me who are still picking up Hebrew.  The only thing, as a Gentile, I have a struggle with in the English translation is the transliterated words as opposed to the Anglinized words.  Not a big deal, just takes some getting used to.  This is well worth the price, esp. for the serious student or scholar.	2001-03-28
US	52439747	R2OSNW9TI1MIY4	0310209307	938771460	The Case for Christ:  A Journalist's Personal Investigation of the Evidence for Jesus	Books	5	4	6	N	N	best recent introductory apologetic	If look up from the trees (the specific issues each chapter deals with) and you look to the forrest, this book was brilliantly done.  Strobel is following the same basic outline as &quot;More Than a Carpenter,&quot; although I believe this book is better than that old standard.  The progression of the book is like Panzer divisions sweeping across France swiftly.  <br />First, Strobel establishes the general trustworthiness of Scripture.  This is really easy to establish, given archeology and the great manuscript evidence the Bible has going for it.  (Not to mention the attestation of early church fathers which Strobel didn't mention.)  Once this point is established, it is game, set, match.  Strobel very clearly in his first section establishes the fact of the general reliability of Scripture.<br />In the second section, Strobel deals with objections and questions regarding the person of Jesus.  He has a wonderful chapter with a Messianic Jew that dealves into fulfilled prophecy like Isaiah 53.<br />The third section is extremely strong as well.  It argues for the Resurrection of Jesus.  Simply put, there is no plausible naturalistic scenario that accounts for all of the facts surrounding the Resurrection.  You can establish that Jesus died, that the tomb was empty, and that his followers claimed to see Him and honestly believed they saw, ate, and talked with a Resurrected Jesus.  Only an anti-supernatural bias or wish-projection is available to explain the Resurrection away.<br />This is a really strong book.  I will echo the other reviewers.  It is introductory.  Conceivably, some of the chapters could have been argued better, but they were all argued very well.  That's just nitpicking.  This book is better than his follow-up the Case for Faith, but that book is highly recommended as well.  TCFC has the advantage of having a unified progression.  First, you establish Scripture.  Second, establish the person of Christ as historical and deal with objections.  Third,end with the Resurrection.  You can establish the reality of Christ with just the first one or third one by itself.  Taken as a whole, you have a rock-solid apologetic.	2001-03-09
US	52439747	RIHVUF4X5EU00	0310435706	896560586	Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties	Books	4	29	40	N	N	solid reference work	I've heard a lot of critics.  We must keep in mind that critics, just like believers, are biased.  They need the Bible to be untrue.  They need it, because they need to live in rank sin.  (Please reference RC Sproul's &quot;If There's a God, Why are There Atheists?&quot;) I've never seen an alleged contradiction that hasn't been either resolved or enough reasonable explanations given that it remains a problem for me.  <br />This book helps aide those who want to examine these difficulties.  I do not agree with the author all of the time.  I've seen others give better answers to the same questions.  But I must say, when he is on, the author is spot on.  And he's on a lot.  The book is also not as exhaustive as I would like.  My only other problem with the book is that it would have benefited from more people writing in it (to give it more of an encyclopedia feel).  However, it is a wonderful resource I highly recommend.  I also like how the book deals with some passages that are difficult to understand, not just alleged contradictions.<br />I highly suggest reading his passage on the critics of Daniel, and how these critics completely ignore the evidence to give it a late date.  Why did they give the book a late dating?  Because if they didn't, they would be admitting to fulfilled prophecy.  That is the bias believers are up against.  And that is why I feel justified in saying what I said in the first paragraph of this review.	2001-03-09

It is exteremely good as an introduction to apologetics.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars.  Mr. Strobel interviews one person per objection.  The plus side to that is that if he interviews someone great, the interview can be in depth and the answers will be satisfactory.  If the person isn't that great, the answers in the chapter will reflect that.  I only found one chapter where the person being interviewed wouldn't be my first choice.<br />Objection 1 deals with the Problem of Evil, namely how can a good God allow evil to exist.  This was by far the best chapter.  The interviewee did a great job and went into many possible explanations.  He hit the most important point.  The objection assumes objective good and evil.  And that can't exist without God.  So for the objection to make any sense God must exist.<br />Objection 2 dealt with whether miracles contradict science.  That was easily dealt with.  This objection is derived from David Hume.  Objection 3 was a good overview of the Achilles Heel of a pure-naturalistic view of evolution.  Getting from dead chemicals to a hugely complex cell.<br />Objection 4 seemed a bit weaker than the others.  It dealt with God's order to wipe out certain people groups.  Some of the answers were quite good, but I would highly recommend RC Sproul's &quot;Holiness of God&quot; which also touches on this issue.  Any discussion of this should be grounded in a proper understanding of God's holiness and love.<br />Objection 5 was dealt with masterfully by Ravi Zacharias, who dealt with the exclusivity of the claims of Christianity.  There was a lot more that could have been said or emphasized.  Ravi did a great job though.  One thing should have been hit harder.  It seems unfair to people that I believe and go to heaven, but someone who doesn't isn't.  Seems arbitrary, like you have the wrong ticket or something.  This overlooks the sin-payment Jesus paid for us.  If you believe on Jesus thisapplies to you.  If not, your sin remains on you.  This emphasizes that our sin doesn't remain unpunished even if we believe, but Jesus gets punished in our stead.<br />Objection 6 was a &quot;loving God wouldn't send people to hell.&quot;  This was the worst of all objections, but that isn't to say some good wasn't in the chapter.  The answers were too man-centered for my taste, focusing on our choice and our dignity.  I would have focussed on the holiness of God.  Once that's understood, most people's objections would be &quot;how could a good God allow anyone in heaven.&quot;  Another troubling thing was the quesiness the Moreland had with active punishment being a part of hell.  Hell isn't just a sum of your choices.  It's what you deserve.  I recommend &quot;Wrath of Almighty God&quot; by Jonathan Edwards for a more biblical, although more unpopular approach.<br />Objection 7 dealt with all the nasty things that have occured in church history.  Kudos for not glossing over the bad.  They should have mentioned that we can't hide behind others on judgment day.<br />Objection 8 was a wonderful chapter on doubt in the life of the seeker and believer.	2001-02-22

On two occasions, I experienced holy laughter.  But I would always wonder, why aren't I laughing like everyone else?  And why are the people praying over me getting upset when I don't get &quot;slain&quot;?  My pastor had a prophecy that people would be lining up to come to this time of refreshing.  Well, when I returned a few years later, nada.  Same amount of people.  That was my first major seed of doubt.<br />From that background, I was exposed to this book and the teaching of Hank Hanegraaff.  Since I was convinced and I came from this background, let me tell you why I think Hank is right.<br />1) the people who started this are the false teachers and false prophets of the Word of Faith movement.  People like Hinn, Hagin, etc.<br />2) The leaders of this movement claim Jonathan Edwards as the theologian of their movement.  This is so ridiculous I can't even begin to describe this.  They must have no clue what the heck they are even talking about.  This throws doubt on every fiber of their discernment skills.  If you think Edwards would have been supportive of this, you are obviously a liar or not so smart.  <br />3) The leaders of this movement have made false prophecies and other false theological statements.  Some of their words of knowledge just do not line up with the Word of God.  So if it is a spirit talking to them, it's a wrong one.  &quot;A whole new understanding of Christianity.&quot;  Really.  Well, that's an understanding not based on the understanding of the apostles.<br />4) This point was the most important.  The phenomena of this movement can be replicated by non-Christians.  Hindus, hypnotists, etc. can produce this.  Hank documents a non-Christian reporter who experienced the phenomena when he went to Toronto.  Mesmer, who gave us the word &quot;mesmerism&quot;, produced the same stuff Benny Hinn does.  This is avery important point and I'll explain why.  If non-believers can experience it, false teachers and false prophets can produce it, and non-Christians can produce it, it is safe to assume that this is not of God.  Hank adequately documents this in the book.<br />The last thing I would note, not in the book, is the fact that if this is such a mighty move of God, why do we not see radically changed communities and a mass-turning towards God?<br />This book is a wonderful documentation of the movement.  I did not find Hank's tone negative.  He documents the facts, to the detriment of the movement.  If you are biased towards this movement, you are going to view Hank's words as negative.  The only problem is that they are true.  As Hank and Edwards would encourage, focus on the glory of God, the majesty of Christ, and the solid foundation laid for us in Scripture.	2000-09-22

I'm a Gentile believer who has  been involved with the Messianic Jewish/Jewish-Christian community for the  last 7 years.  In the summer of '97, I was an intern for Moishe Rosen,  their founder.  I also got to know several of the staff members well,  especially their executives and heads of their different branches.<br />This  book is really accurate.  Many of the stories I have heard before.  The  story of Jews for Jesus is primarily about proclaiming the gospel.  For all  the flaws of this organization (or any organization) or the people in Jews  for Jesus, people are missing the point.  This group of people are  incredibly committed to proclaiming the gospel.  From being around them, I  can tell you it is downright infectious.  This is what the book, and their  story, is all about.  They are incredibly serious about Jesus and His  gospel.  Hardworking, but fun-loving.<br />Having worked under Moishe Rosen  closely for about two months, I would like to say that this book is  inadequate.  He is an incredible personality, which cannot come accross in  a book.  Being discipled by him is an amazing experience, and I feel  blessed by it.  His concern for people is genuine, and I believe it shows  in this book.  But I did want to point out that this book cannot capture  him fully for the reader.<br />This book does not gloss over problems, but it  does not gloss over the wonderful things as well.  The author's background  in investigating other Christian and cultic groups served her well here,  esp. because of all the &quot;cult&quot; allegations against the group.   She helps to give a well-balanced, historical perspective.<br />Lastly, she  also does not fully capture the friendliness of the people I met and worked  with.  They are people who you can make very close, fast friendships  with.<br />If you want a good, balanced, and accurate record of Jews for  Jesus, buy this book.	2000-09-14

At least I know now I'm  not an idiot.  I actually saw someone's copy of the first edition and it  was a good book.  But it didn't have the imfamous &quot;...&quot;.  I  assume like many computer company HR departments the editors don't know  anything about programming.  My advice is to do yourself a favor and get  another book.	2000-08-29

I really do not understand why this book was so controversial.  MacArthur  does not believe in works-righteousness as part of the gospel.  But works  is a natural outgrowth of genunine faith.  This is Gospel 101.  Anyone who  is even remotely familiar with the Protestant debates with Rome would know  this.  All you have to do is read the book of James.  A faith without works  is a dead faith and it cannot save.  The other view only has false  assurance for unbelievers who fool around with Christianity.  The demons  believe in the facts of Christ.  Their problem is they don't trust, which  is shown in their works.  From Luther to Calvin on, this has been  emphasized.  Those who oppose MacArthur may be good people, but they are  really wrong.<br />MacArthur is a wonderful Bible expositor.  I greatly  benefited from his insights on Scripture.  He is a man of great passion and  it shows.  For a complete view of the gospel, I highly recommend this book.	2000-08-28

The danger in understanding Edwards is that all too few know anything  about him except for this sermon.  He spoke about the excellency of Christ  more than any other topic.  <br />The editor was wise in noting that Edwards  gave this sermon to a church that was playing around with God.  Jesus'  example is that He was very harsh with the religious hypocrites, and He was  gentle and sweet with the &quot;sinners.&quot;<br />It should be noted that  without law there can be no concept of grace.  When the doctrines of grace  were recovered in the Reformation, respect for God's law was likewise  recovered.  If someone is coming to Jesus not based on because they need  forgiveness and atonement with a Holy God, they are coming on false  grounds.  That is why this sermon is needed today.  There is too much  felt-needs sermons.  Come to Jesus because He will make you better.  No,  come to Jesus and escape the wrath of God.  If you come on other grounds  than that, you are endanger of not being a true disciple.  That last  sentence may sound weird.  If it does, I would read &quot;The Gospel  According to Jesus&quot; by John MacArthur.	2000-08-21

That book is good for all levels of Java  experience.  This book is a runner-up.  This is not to detract from this  book.  It is extensive, and it has a good introduction to Java in the  beginning of the book.  If you are new, pass this book by...for the time  being.  The only flaw I have with this book is that the methods of the  different classes are not put into context.  If you come across the  pertinent class and method to use, and you are still unsure of how to use  them, you'll still need to move on and find more info somewhere else.  That  is why I suggested the above book.  They actually complement each other.  I  would not do without this book.  It's widespread use is no accident.  With  O'Reilly you know you are getting nothing less than good, even if you are  not getting the best book in a given subject area.	2000-08-20

It is worth every penny  you will spend on it.  I would pay double the price, but don't tell the  publisher.  This is my favorite reference book, and my Java programming  would not be as productive without this book.  The book is huge, because it  covers every class within the standard library (io, net, lang, etc.).  As  much as I appreciate the O'Reilly Nutshell book, this is far superior to  that book.  This has something Nutshell doesn't.  Context.  Not only does  it have all the classes with all their methods, it puts each method in  context.  It shows you how they are used by providing relevant example code  and descriptions.  And the descriptions in the book are wonderful.  You  will look up a class and find a related class that will work better for  your needs.  I especially recommending getting this book for a team of  developers.  Leave the book in the room for office use.  If you can so  afford, get it for each developer.  This is like the Post-it note.  You  would never live without it, even though you managed and may have even done  well before it came along.	2000-08-20

I ended up using Java, but I never got  around to using Corba.  This book was very helpful in weighing the  different technology options available to me.  I used it to learn Java RMI,  which is related to Corba.  I use that as an illustration to show how this  book covered competing technologies well, so you can pick which technology  is best for you.  This most helpful.  When learning and picking  technologies I come in with a whatever-works approach.  This book is  aligned with that philosophy.  If you are thinking about using Corba or  something similar, esp. with Java, I would buy this book in a heartbeat.   It comes in handy as good reference.	2000-08-20

And if this doctrine was important enough to merit the  council of Trent, that council's anathema must be removed before there can  be any unity.  Sproul does a wonderful job in documenting the two  positions, and he does do a fair job describing the Catholic position.  I  still don't understand how people can read James and not see that James was  railing against easy-believism.  &quot;Demons have faith.&quot;  Obviously,  James is not talking about the saving kind of faith.  And frankly, I do not  understand how you can read John, Ephesians, Romans, and Galatians and come  up with the Catholic position.  Catholicism has other doctrines that are in  error, but this one can keep people under chains.  Even if you are  Catholic, this will at least explain the Reformed position to you and clear  up some easy-believism misunderstandings.  I really do not understand why  people will give only one star if you disagree with the position.  Like  there was nothing else in the book that at least raised it to two stars.   That's the way people rate things on Amazon.  I mention this only to  encourage any Catholic to at least see what the other side is saying,  unfiltered through other mouths.  Sproul is one of the premier theologians  of our age, who studied under a premier theologian.  He is worth your time.	2000-08-19

Dr. Rawlings was personally affected by one of his patient's NDE which led him to  document negative NDEs.  It is abundantly clear that we cannot hold that  all NDEs are bliss.  This stinks for a lot of people because people want to  live their lives with no consequences.  So they go to two extremes.  Either  all go to bliss or there is no God.  (I would suggest the book &quot;If  there is a God, why are there atheists?&quot; for a Christian analysis of  that or read Jean Paul-Sarte's No Exit for an atheist who expresses those  emotions.)  New Age authors who make money holding out fals hope will not  welcome this.<br />I leave off a few stars, because of all the non-NDE info in  the book.  It is interesting and worthwhile in its own right, but it seems  to be a tangent to the main thrust of the book.	2000-08-01

I tell you that in order to say that the Bible is good for all Christians wanting to engage the texts.  It is a  starting point and should be treated as such.  Namely, it will not take  definitive stands on issues Christians can reasonably disagree, like  election.  But it will give you the differing views.  Many in the Christian  community may think all Christians are pretrib, premil, Arminians.  That  isn't the case and the editors knew this.  It is also good for dealing with  specific difficult verses, besides addressing the big picture questions.  A  mini-concordance in the back is also useful.<br />After you start here, I  would suggest getting a book or two on Bible difficulties.  When you tackle  passages you don't understand, you will be amazed at how accurate and  beautiful the Bible is.  If you are too lazy to wrestle with those  passages, you miss out.  People should also move onto commentaries by the  giants of our faith: Calvin, Luther, Spurgeon, John Owen, Matthew Henry.  I've mentioned all Reformed commentators, but I'm sure you can find good  non-Reformed giants as well.	2000-08-01

You can take a minute or two and read the next section, and if you want put it down.  There is a lot of information in  each section.  The first part of the book is biographical in nature. The  more interesting part, in my opinion, is the second part.  This is where  the editor really shined and his admiration and understanding of Lewis  shines through.  Each section deals with Lewis' thoughts on certain  subjects.  It is not really biographical...it is picking the brain of a  giant.  The book is truly wonderful and I suggest it for all Lewis fans, or  for those serious about becoming more acquainted with his thoughts.  Would  make a great gift.	2000-08-01

I think it is very helpful in identifying recoccuring patterns in church history.  The rise of monastic orders, the  decline of monastic orders, the tension between freedom of worship in  letting the Spirit move and a structure to move within.  These ongoing  patterns are mentioned again and again.  The authors are not very critical  in some spots, where they should be.  Charles Finney, even though he  belongs on the list, was a heretic and should be mentioned as such.  The  negative ramifications of his thought and practices are not explored.   Likewise, the significance of World War I in destroying postmillenialism  and the significance of the Holocaust are not explored.  But what it does,  it does well.  It gives you a good cursory overview of church history by  giving you a lot of short vinettes.  I highly recommend it, but I would not  rely on it solely.	2000-07-31

Edwards is the greatest mind America has every produced and his stuning logic, acumen, and biblical knowledge are on display here.  Edwards, unforetunatly, is only known today for hellfire and brimstone sermons.   This is unfortunate because this does not represent the totality of what he  talked about.  His 'hellfire' sermons are in here.  Unfortunately for  humanity, he was correct.  If you do not understand God's holiness and  justice, these sermons will seem cruel and sadistic to you.  (I would  suggest you read R.C. Sproul's Holiness of God.)  However, if you are  willing to be challenged with the extent of your own sin, read on.   Jonathan Edwards is a giant among men.  I wish we could have another like  him for today.<br />This book is not for those who want a light read.  Edwards  doesn't write like that.  Bring your thinking cap.  You must also remember  he was speaking and writing in the 1700's.  The style of the prose reflects  that.  But his genious still comes through.  I thank God for Edwards and I  highly recommend this book.	2000-07-31

I found the book easily readable.  I use servlets on the job and any real-life problem or question  I've faced has been dealt with in this book.  The general introduction to  servlets chapters were great for comparing the technology to CGI, and they  helped convince my management that my choice of servlets was a wise one.   Also, the oreilly Java servlet classes that come with the book were helpful  too, and I have relied on them for real business use.  Servlets touch on  many other Java APIs in the course of use and it was not the authors  intention of putting in everything you need to know, but just about  everything you need to know about servlets.  For example, the chapter on  JDBC doesn't exhaust JDBC, but it will give you a taste so you can figure  out how it affects servlets.  The author's website which complents the book  is quite helpful as well.  I would suggest that this computer book covers  its scope better than any other computer book I've read.  I highly  recommend it.	2000-07-24

One should be warned that it is only one translator, so bias can  more easily creep into the translation.  But for what it does, it does  well.

Additionally, it is good for dealing with  &quot;problem&quot; passages which have been alledged to have anti-semitic  overtones in the New Testament.  His Jewish perspective helps us to see  that when you view the passages without bias and from its original Jewish  viewpoint, there is no antisemitism in the New Testament.  Consider Paul in  Romans saying how much advantage there is to being a Jew.  So this  commentary is a must-have for people in Jewish ministry and would be very  helpful to any student of the Word.	2000-07-24

He does this so well.  Instead of the Trinity being just another doctrine, or something  made-up at Nicea, or a possible interpretation, White shows us that the  doctrine of the Trinity is forced upon us from the Scriptures.  One must  engage in mental gymnastics to get out from under this view.  The book does  not focus too much on why it is important (it does some at the beginning  and end), but it does a tremendous job in showing the Trinity from the  Scriptures using the whole of God's Word.  Use this book to pick the mind  of James White's scholarship and knowledge.  You will not be disappointed.	2000-07-24

Books	5	6	8	N	N	Keep Your Focus	The reason why there are atheists, from the Christian perspective, is that men hate God and what to live a life as their own masters.  There is nothing worse than being faced with the real God.  Therefore, if we are to  have God, natural man will try to dress him up in our image. <br />The book is  not meant to address alternative theories and it is not designed to prove  that God exists.  It exists to turn the tables on the most common objection  to Christianity by atheists: it is a crutch.  Well, the crutch is on the  other side as well.  Before evolution, the atheists jumped on spontaneous  generation.  It was joyous because they no longer had to explain the world  without a Creator.  Spontaneous generation has long since passed, but the  lesson should be learned.  Men will leap on anything if they can avoid  God.<br />So if we want to debate the existance of God, let's do so...but with  the knowledge that bias exists on the atheist side as well.	2000-07-21

While they sanitize most of what they say on TV, they hide poison in the skin of the truth.<br />The movement clearly panders  to a wicked and adulturous generation that demands signs.  Selfishness  surrounds this movement.  What the church needs to do is focus in on the  glory of God as our chief end.  Our chief end is not to have God as a  cosmic bellhop.  <br />The focusing in on giving in order to get more and  more...and name it claim it...reveals this selfishness.

It is worth every star.  In the subject of theology or philosophy, the greatness of a work is not due to the author coming up with a novel  theory.  It is due to the accuracy of his work.<br />Sproul's work is so  spot-on, I am ashamed I never saw the holiness of God more clearly in the  Scriptures before.  It even helped explain some of my own experiences.   This work should be read and re-read.  It should be given as gifts.  It  should be in our library.  If begging and pleading will get you to read  this, I'll do it.<br />Understanding the holiness of God helped me systamize  many theological questions, such as the Cross, God's judgement, and our  reaction to God's holiness.<br />But above all, what I carried away from this  book was our natural repulsion to God's holy character.<br />This book has  been a help to many, and I'm sure it will be to any believer who reads  it.<br />One final note:  I liked the original version better.  The final two  chapters in the revision are worthwhile and good.  But in my mind, chapter  9 is so impactful, ending right there has better flair.  This in no way  diminished my admiration for the new chapters.	2000-06-27
US	52439747	R3S5IHS34OSX8X	189062621X	991819171	Hating Whitey: And Other Progressive Causes	Books	4	7	9	N	N	insightful	Only from a pen of a former Marxist could such an accute critique flow.  If one wants to search for the unbalance in the political left, one should look no farther from this book.<br />I left off a star because because I did  not find the later portions of the book as great as the beginning.  Although I did find those good as well.<br />He is at his best dealing with  liberal hypocrites.  Unfortunately for America, this gives Horowitz a lot  of material.<br />The underlying tone of the book is hurt, which is  undergirded by sadness.  The wasted potential and energies from the  misguided left is truly preventing our country from being all it can be.	2000-06-27

I found Wilberforce the most interesting, but that was because he was the least known to me.<br />The force of character in shaping events is an interesting point of  reference for a biography.<br />I can't help but notice that stubbornness was  a common trait.	2000-06-27

It is quite solid with a good amount of analysis.  It covers a lot of topics and it covers them well.  I leave off a star for a variety of reasons which would make my rating 3 1/2 stars.<br />1) The book is weak where Dr. Geisler is weak.  As was shown in Chosen but Free, Dr. Geisler does not have a good grasp of Reformed theology.  This weakness appears from time to time.<br />2) It is not an encyclopedia.  It is a collection of Dr. Geisler's notes.  If he has problems with a position (Van Til comes to mind) he will let you know.  I like that, but that does not seem in keeping with the spirit of an encyclopedia.<br />3) As was mentioned earlier, this book desperately needs an index.	2000-05-16

I read some of the Arminian reviews and am distressed.  The best illustration of Calvinism is thus: go to a cemetary and ask the dead to rise w/o God's help.<br />Sproul  uses his background in philosphy to lay the groundwork for cogent and  logical arguments.  <br />I didn't like being a Calvinist at first, but I know  realize it's sweetness and beauty.  Our original sin, our orientation,  justly condemns us, but due to His mercy we are saved.	1999-02-27
