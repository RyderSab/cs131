These are all facts, not opinions. This book merely looked at ensuing scenarios and it hit some bulls eyes, not least of which was that the US is so over extended it finds it very difficult to wage two regional wars simultaneously. At one point during 2005, more than half of the US combat forces in Iraq were National Guard, evidence to me, if not to \\"Andrew in Indonesia\\" that US forces are overstretched. To make it even easier for \\"Andrew in Indonesia, right now, as of October 11th, 2005, 49.34% of the approximately 152,000 U.S. troops in Iraq are reservists: 49,000 Army National Guard, 22,000 Army Reserve and 4,000 Marine Reserve. During the last few months, National Guardsmen have accounted for over 50% of all US fatalities in Iraq; the US is over stetched and is cutting back troops big time in Japan and Korea to plug the gaps this book mentioned and which \\"Andrews in Indonesia\\" finds a source of amusement. Unless it intends to deploy its entire National Guard overseas, it will continue to cut troops where it can.<br />So \\"Andrew in Indonesia\\" better consider again. To say that the indisputable rise of China is anti Chinese drivel is, well, just drivel. The 2004 response to the Asian tsunami showed that India, the US and Japan can all conduct blue water operations and China currently cannot (and countries like Australia can do so to a limited extent). But times change and China will, in time, exert its power well beyond its borders just as the US currently does. China's moves will, quite naturally, be watched in India, Japan and the US. So what ails \\"Andrew in Indonesia\\"?<br />This book looked at such scenarios and with the stalemate on the Korean peninsula. It was ahead of its time. The game = as in \\"game theory\\", \\"Andrew n Indonesia\\" = has moved on and so have I. If you must read the book, do so in a library as the reforms Koizumi et al have instigated and which the book drew attention to makes it is a little dated at this stage. It sold very well in Singaore (#1 for a while there) and in Indonesia, where \\"Andrew in Indonesia\\" most likely bought his copy if he actually lives there.China's moves will, quite naturally, be watched in India, Japan and the US.

Unfortunately, his English does not totally compensate for his lack of an over arching theme to this book which offers glimpses into The World Bank by concentrating on the activities and antics of James Wolfensohn, its very capable former \\"warrior king\\" leader. By making Wolfensohn the protagonist, the author takes away from the book's sub title: A Story of Failed States, Financial Crises, and the Wealth and Poverty of Nations.<br /><br />Even the sub title contains a number of different themes and getting one's head around them is a tall order. Joe Stiglitz, former Nobel Economics prize Winner and Wolfensohn WB side kick I feel, did this well in Globalization and Its Discontents.  However, as that book criticized the IMF which Mallaby, given his background, tends to favor, it is not the correct template for this book which gives us vignettes such as Exxon's attempts to extract oil from Chad without having the NGOs sabotage its efforts. Case studies such as Chad, Tibet and a few others might have gone a long way to meeting my expectations from the sub title.<br /><br />Instead we get a mildly interesting bio of Wolfensohn, his ultra successful pre WB business life included, an entertaining description of his flits around Africa, some glimpses into US policy towards the WB and IMF and not much else. I would have preferred a book focusing more on the sub title's topics and not on the charismatic \\"warrior king\\" who briefly breathed some life into one of the world's top posts. The book is neither fish nor fowl, neither a glossy bio of Wolfenshn, nor a good critique of the issues implicit in the sub title. A good read but not an insightful one.	2005-10-09

This is obvious in reading the collection of essays which focus more on Institutional Economics (a branch of sociology), rhetoric, and anthropology. Most of the contributors buzz around the issue of the (patriarchal) family and use Gary Becker, another (very undeserving) Nobel prize winner as their whipping boy. But Becker's work on the economics of sleep and such like is also tangential.<br /><br />This slim tome strikes me as an exercise in academic vanity publishing. The inclusion of Donald McCloskey, who got a sex change operation since it was published, reinforces that. Economics has a myriad of failings and short comings but having it colonized by even softer and shallower social \\"sciences\\" is not the answer. The contributors devote some space to explaining that their type of work is regard as sciences in most languages, English being the big exception. That seems to be where they are at: kitchen arguments, ignoring facts and solid axioms in favor of doctrine.	2005-10-09

Books like this are the holy scriptures of the far right, Rush Limbaugh and George Bush's Vulcans. The Austrians, as is obvious from this tome and as they very freely admit, build their conclusions on frail axioms and then they go on to arrive at very questionable conclusions about economics, freedom, democracy and the like. This is a key economic/methodological point and the book is probably worth reviewing with that in mind.<br />Hayek wrote this during the Second World War and it is credited with costing Churchill, who adopted it as his manifesto, the post war election. It is not surprising that British squaddies, having risked their necks to buy Hayek the freedom to expound on his axioms, would have preferred Keynes' welfare state/state intervention over the Newt Gingrich picture this book paints.<br />Still, as Newt and Hayek attest, the right do not take a licking easily. Hayek's main contribution was not his questionable writings but his setting up of right wing think thanks which have enjoyed inordinate influence over the years. They, rather than his original tome, are worth studying and reading about. The Road to Serfdom is worth the effort only if you want to get a glimpse at the axioms behind the hard right. Although Rush Limbaugh and friends do that more cogently and entertainingly, this is one of their primary sources.<br />So, read and buy it if you must. But please keep in mind its immediate relevance derived from its anti Keynesian \\"Big Government\\" approach and the relevance of the Austrian School today derives more from their think thanks and well placed adherents than from the original words of Hayek, von Mises et al.	2005-10-03

He flits around the world, dropping in on Walmart, the Chinese and Yahoo, and everywhere he sees the same mantra\\" Globalization has made the world falt, a veritable global village. Yet villages are intricate social structures where much can be learned. I cannot see much being learned here in this extended essay. Sure, the prose is good: it helps to hide the lack of bones and ocntent in this book.<br /><br />Consider page 127: \\"The Arab-Muslim world's resistance to globalization is something that some liberal Arab commentators are now focusing on..... It is simply too easily forgotten that when it comes to economic, activity, one of the greatest virtues a country or community can have isa culture of tolerance\\".<br /><br />Who are these liberal Arabs and can they affect change in the Arab world?<br /><br />Page 328. Here we come again to the coefficient of flatness. (Nice menaingless turn of phrase).<br /><br />page 329: Muslim Spain was a trading and merchant culture where people had to live by their wits and hterefore learned to live well with each other.<br /><br />How many times have we read that about the Moors? Thw writing is flat.<br /><br />pp 456/7: Here is another gem:<br /><br />Only Indonesia has more Muslims than Indonesia and \\"There are no Indian Muslims that we know of in al-Qaeda\\". ....Why do we not read about Indian Muslims....wanting to fly airplanes into the Taj mahal or the British Embassy? Lord knows....<br /><br />Indeed. Glib, empty vacuous remarks like that put this book in context. If British Muslims have issues, so too might Indian ones. The world is not flat; it is very complex and books like this do not help to level out our thinking on it at all.	2005-10-03

They might well describe the markets better than the CAPM but do they predict better is the key question? William Sharpe, who \\"invented\\" the CAPM, makes this very point on his home page. The CAPM captures risk and return, albeit imperfectly but what does Mandelbrot capture? Certainly not an audience as his theories will remain tangential until they have practical use. He wil always be at the frontier until his theory has a practical application, something for good and bad the CAPM has.<br />The normal curve, is, with the lognormal distribution, the entry point to the world of heavy tails and quirkier distribtions and these are all used in markets world wide every day of the week; even the CAPM is widely used in corporate risk assessment. Ditto the imperfect Black Scholes model which allows us to predict, accurately enough for our purposes, the price of a European call, and thence a put etc etc. Although improvements have been have been made, it is like mother nature: unless the improvements give us better predictability, they are probably not worth the effort. Because the BS model gave us that predictability, it is widely used. Until Mandelbrot can do the same, his work will remain tangential at best, irrelevant at worst.	2005-10-03

His basic thesis is that people respond to incentives and if big, corrupt governments and dictators have no reason to change, they will not change (for the better). Although such moral hazard problems are covered in most basic economics textbooks, they seem to beyond the ken of organizations such as the IMF. Easterly's genius is showing us how the small things, like the Korean training some Bangladeshis in textile exporting, can make a huge change. He brings a host of often neglected issues to the fore: these include the often debilitating realpolitik of ethnic diversity in stifling growth (the pot has to be divided between competing ethnic groups, each of which only lifts one corner of the development boat and so capsize the rudderless, waterless vessel before it can set sail) and poverty traps in the US (such as whites in Eastern Kentucky). He does all of this with an easy writing style that make his ideas very easy to digest. A worthwhile purchase.	2005-10-03

Not so. The author lays into the IMF in particular from the get go and does not let up until the very end. He paints the IMF as a bunch of ideologues who impose their US inspired dogma on all under developed countries needing international financial assistance. Anybody can do that but what the author brings to the party is a number of key \\"common sense\\" clearly written economic insights that obviously elude the IMF and other one dimensional players. The IMF follow an ideological script and read it from their US HQ. They ignore local input and absolve themselves from the human mass sufferings they have induced in countries as diffuse as Indonesia and the former USSR. Obviously information asymmetries were not on their Economics 101 reading lists.<br /><br />Finance theory has long told us the obvious truism that trying to maintain a target such as inflation or a fixed rate of exchange obviates the good of that target. Common sense: if a banana republic decides to defend its rate of echange \\"to the death\\" then it will die as speculators will gang up in the asymmetric bet that it will eventually have to devalue. The auhtor sees that but the IMF, despite all the damning evidence of its interference in defending indefensible exchange rates, obviously does not. Simililarly with how inflation works in kleptocracies such as the Philippines and Latin America. Stiglitz explains how IMF intervention in those scenarios, by pouring money in and then withdrawing it, help the Third World (and Wall Street) rich and impoverish the poor.<br /><br />Sebastian Mallaby in The World's Banker has a shot at Stiglitz for \\"finding one sore and picking at it\\". He found not a sore but a huge institution that turned its back on its original mission and contributed to many of the problems the world has endured over the last 20 years. Mallaby, interestingly, formerly wrote for The Economist, which promotes so called Free Trade, the other bane of the Third World.<br /><br />If you are interested in getting a proper handle on the IMF in particular, read Globalization and its Discontents. There is much food for thought in it, if any of our leaders can ever be brought to this tiny trough of self enlightenment.the world has endured over the last 20 years.

It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over.	2005-10-03

This makes the main script and they exerices outlined needlessly difficult to follow.<br /><br />There is no doubt that the program works for the author and his acolytes. However, that is odwn to discipline, not to following this book. He could have easily, with some more work, have laid it out a lot better.

LP's Bangkok section as well as its mobile wing heap great praise on the Atlanta Hotel, Soi 2, Sukhumvit Road. They spend about a page telling us of its former glory during the 1950s and that some dude with a history of sorts in colonial India set it up and that it was the first to do this, that and the other, all in in 1950s, 60s and 70s. This hotel builds up its founder like he was some Jim Morrison type icon, not the end note in history of colonial India that he was. LP has simply swallowed this pretentious back packer hotel's propaganda and devoted an undeserved page or more to it. It fails to tell us that the restaurant staff there are decidely odd and that the hotel is trading on its past and on its Fawlty Towers aura. When they add tax to your bill, the end result is an odd amount, say like 457 baht for a night. The hotel and even the menu are festooned with signs and notes telling you they do not want undesirables and what the physical consequences for you will be if you object to being refused service. If you think the rooms are over priced, signs and notes tell you that the hotel's founder, before he went senile, used to tell people who objected to the price to f- off. The point here is not the price but the Basil Fawlty nature of this unfurbished hotel and the fact that the LP heaps valuable space and resulting custom on them.<br />Out in the sticks, they write about \\"the last time we visited town X, we stayed in Hotel Y\\". But if they stay in one trick towns, why do they change hotels so often? My answer is that they nick a lot of their stuff from Thailand's very capable tourist offices. So should you if you want detailed information. A trip to a tourist office and some basic on line searches will see you better ficed than buying this Cole's Notes of Thai Tourist Office Information.<br />Friends recommend other travel guides instead such as the Rough Guide. LP is simply too big. Even their orginal South East Asia on a Shoetring is a waste of money imho. If you go the back packer route, you will pick up a ton of information along the way from fellow travellers and you will most likely find abandoned LPs in those places, the Atlanta included. Leave home without it and use your baggage allowance for something more practical.ven their orginal South East Asia on a Shoetring is a waste of money imho.

How many crimes are committed in thy name!\\" These, the last words Madame Roland spoke before she was executed on 23 November 1793 at the height of the Reign of Terror, kept echoing through my mind as I read this \\"memoir in books.\\"<br /><br />Azar Nafisi, a professor of English Literature, spent 18 years in Iran after the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. This book describes her public but mostly private interactions with a small band of her students. Nafisi and her charges used Nabokov's Lolita, Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, as well as books by Henry James and Jane Austen both to maintain some inner independence for themselves and to try to make sense of the bleak and demonic world Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic Revolution plunged all Iranians into. By far the strongest literary allusions are those relating to Nabokov. Thus, just as Humbert steals Lolita's life by denying her the simple pleasures of a child, so also does Nafisi contend that Islamic Iran denied its citizens the simplest joys of life.<br /><br />Just as Nabokov \\"during the Russian Revolution, would not allow himself to be diverted by the sound of bullets\\", so also do Nafisi and her students strive not to be enticed out of their self imposed fantasy world of books into the harsh reality of Islamic Iran. Just as Nabokov \\"kept on writing his solitary poems while he heard the guns and saw the bloody fights from his window\\" so also does the author try to get her charges to think \\"how these great works of imagination could help us in our present trapped situation as women.\\" Theirs is an attempt to escape from the cold reality of the revolutionary terror consuming Iran into the safer, more secure and, to Nafisi and her charges, infinitely more congenial world of Western and Persian literature.<br /><br />As one who finds her taste in literature rather pedestrian if not downright plebian, I found her discourses on these authors and their works to be tedious going. The fact that she totally ignored the Revolution's genesis also grated. Her family's connections, however tenuous, with the Shah's regime became more obvious as the book wore on and that seemed to be the obvious reason why, unlike Madame Roland, she was ignoring the bloody events unraveling outside of the drawing room where she held court.<br /><br />More importantly, however, as the book wears on, it becomes obvious that, just as in Madame Roland's time, the Reign of Terror is simply too awful to contemplate. Nafisi writes, almost in passing, of mothers condemning their children to death, and of women she knew being put into sacks and drowned like stray cats for some trivial offence or other.  She tells us of the age of marriage being lowered to nine and of a Baha'i friend who, being forbidden to bury his grandmother in accordance with the rites of their religion, had to bury her in the dead of night at a secret location: the Baha'i graveyards had been bulldozed and turned into pubic urinals.<br /><br />Nor were the University of Tehran and Iran's other great tertiary institutions ivory tower oases from the madness consuming the nation. She writes about petty harassments like \\"angry, pathological individuals pushing pieces of paper with obscene messages under doors\\" and of a government official calling the uncle of one of her students \\"to congratulate him on the death of his son and daughter-in-law.\\"<br /><br />Just as it is easy to eulogize the French, American or Russian revolutions in the abstract, so also is it very easy to comprehend the Islamic position in the abstract: It is now easy to understand what sparked the Iranian Revolution and why that country's people were so angry at America, the Shah's nefarious sponsor and Ayatollah Khomeini's Great Satan.<br /><br />All of that is easy to do. It is infinitely harder to come to terms with the countless lives so wantonly squandered in the Iranian and all other revolutions. Madame Rolande made her last words to a statue of Liberty moments before the guillotine claimed her life. Because no such grand exit was afforded Khomeini's victims, we should, perhaps, remember them all the more. As long as they are not used as pretexts for further demonizing Iran and the other surviving members of the Axis of Evil, books like this, despite their digressions into second rate literature, are very valuable contributions indeed. Because of its considerable faults and pro American angenda, it is better to flick through it in a library than to fork out hard cash to buy it.statue of Liberty moments before the guillotine claimed her life.

This is particularly true as most visas are for only 21 days. Manila outside of Makai is a depressing tgown, Ermita particularly as poor families go there in the hope of begging from tourists. Quiapo of black statue and pirated videos fame is best avoided at night. Pagsanjan, Baguio and other nearby tourist spots are easily reached under your own steam. For Negros, Mindanao or Cebu, a plane is best and LP is worst.<br /><br />Places like Mindanao do not get many tourists and this is evident in the friendliness of the people.

To take Davao as one example: it is littered with cheap hotels from 100-300 pesos near San Pedro Cathedral and there are plenty of middle class hotels around Illustre Street that are much better than Sunny Point Lodge and El Gusto Family Lodge and Royale House, all dumps that LP recommend. Galleria in Illustre Street is a quantum leap above htem and is similarly priced.<br /><br />The book has too much trivial padding and too little hard facts. LP is simply too big an outfit to do the serious research a modern streamlined tourist book needs. This probably explains why they are branching out into coffee table books and the like. There is nothing in htis book that a few good maps and a visit to a tourist office will not improve.	2005-10-02

The book was well timed; it came out when Ireland was achieving economic lift off.

It was a good, well written book looking at the aftermath of the Bubble and the proposed Big Bang reforms. Unlike earlier books written when Japan was outperforming all its competitors, it did not stand in shock, awe and wonder at Japan Inc but instead painted its strengths and many weaknesses. Although controversial, none of the many facts it outlines can be seriously queried.<br /><br />Because the Japanese game, as Gillian Tett's book, PM Koizumi's reform plans and Carlos Ghosn's epxerience, has, in many ways moved on, this book is probably now most useful as a historical summary of what drove Japan into its current round of reforms.	2005-10-02

This book, which explores the intellectual chicanery that underwrote the Evil Empire, is another world classic.<br /><br />Conquest, who has been described as our greatest living modern historian, dispenses with the scholarly footnotes that usually pepper learned books and instead uses the world's great fiction writers such as Fyodor Dostotoevsky and George Orwell to show us what depths the human soul has plumbed. Orwell, who witnessed the Ukrainian famine Stalin deliberately instigated, was amazed that the majority of English Russophiles so blithely ignored it. This complicity in such a manmade calamity is just one tiny bead in the rosary of intellectual and moral disgraces Conquest draws our attention to.<br /><br />As well as reminding us just how morally and intellectually bankrupt Marxism is, he argues that the most susceptible Western intellectuals had \\"minds like jelly\\", just waiting for a Hitler, Lenin or Stalin to imprint their vile creeds on them.<br /><br />Conquest shows a plentitude of the Bolsheviks' idiocies and eloquently explains how their gross ignorance contributed to the deaths of countless millions in the vast lands the Soviet commissars controlled. He also shows how, to quote Comrade Lenin, \\"useful idiots\\" such as H.G. Wells, G.B. Shaw and Sidney and Beatrice Webb, in allowing their minds to be seduced by the KGB, became accessories to the Soviet Union's almost unparalleled crimes against humanity.<br /><br />The untrammeled mind, as Milton's Lucifer tells us in Paradise Lost, is indeed its own domain and can so easily, with mental gymnastics, make a heaven even out of hell. Communist commissars have, throughout the twentieth century, done just that. Fixated on their puerile philosophy and using the most brutal tactics, they convinced themselves and their fellow travelers that they were building heaven on earth. In the process, their system ground millions down in a way that is comparable only to the Hitler regime, which also strove to create hell on earth.<br /><br />Although these historical ogres strove to create darkness at noon, there is, if we can belatedly learn history's most obvious lessons, reason for hope. Although Conquest takes solace from the English Glorious Revolution and mentions in passing such eloquent proponents of non-violence and pluralism as Edmond Bourke, the cancer is, at least, in my opinion, more deeply embedded in our collective consciousness than that. Because silly ideas, when they enter the heads of mindless zealots, can be the most lethal viruses of them all, the challenge must be to create something better on our common planet that the Workers' Paradise Stalin and his cronies worked for. Although that quest should be never ending, Conquest is to be heartily lauded for so eloquently showing to us the deathly consequences of thuggish ideologues forcing their infantile ideas on to society at large.they convinced themselves and their fellow travelers that they were building heaven on earth.

They give a voice to the world's poor, those at the margins, those who are not benefiting from the greatest peacetime boom in history.<br /><br />Although the developing countries carry 90 percent of the world's disease burden, they have access to only 10 percent of the resources that go to health. And, to compound matters, many of those sub-Saharan and Asian countries are overwhelmed by Aids and similar blights. There is a lot of preventable misery in the world.<br /><br />This book works best when it describes those at the receiving end of that misery and our concomitant apathy. The authors begin with the photo of an impoverished child, who scrapes a living in a Guatemala garbage dump that is home to her, her family and thousands of other unfortunate people we will never meet. Because the dump is a cesspit of infectious air and water borne diseases, the pretty little girl will probably be dead before too long.<br /><br />Nsanga, a 26 year-old Zairian mother of two, is already dead. When her family fell into debt, she resorted to prostitution to keep them alive. Now Aids - and the poverty that reduced her to renting out her body for 50 yen a time - has killed her and millions like her.<br /><br />What is to be done? Well, we can blame the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the world's wealthiest people, Nike, Shell and other multinational companies - the usual suspects, in other words. That, at least, is what the authors do. And it is comforting that someone else besides ourselves, Fidel Castro and the authors are to blame.<br /><br />It is also good to read that economic growth is not the miracle drug economists crack it up to be. Like steroids, growth has its considerable downsides and the authors are to be commended for giving us the stories of the casualties of globalization. They are to be commended for showing how the policies of the World Bank sparked the Rwanda genocide. The World Bank, the IMF and companies like Disney, Shell and Nike do have a case to answer.<br /><br />But so too do Fidel Castro, Western Christians and Western liberals, the book's target audience. Any book that praises Cuba's health system runs the risk of losing all credibility. A tin-pot dictator who cannot even supply his people with bars of soap should not have his health policies put on a pedestal.<br /><br />Nestl&eacute;'s should be much more responsible in selling powdered milk to African mothers. The IMF and the World Bank should make some belated restitution to the people of Haiti for supporting the Duvalier kleptocracy. The mining companies, which gave the Navajo the highest cancer rates in the United States, should do something similar.<br /><br />But what should the good guys do? It is interesting, for example, to note that, of the 26 countries with the highest percentage of smokers, only one, Japan, is not a developing country. More Colombians die today from diseases caused by American tobacco than do Americans from Colombian cocaine. The book has a large number of such disjointed facts. Ultimately, however, those facts and the economic preaching get in the way. This book, though very informative, only points the finger of blame; it does not really point a way to the future.da genocide.

His book makes unsettling reading for those who like to think the war against \\"The Axis of Evil\\" is over and won. Although Saddam Hussein and the Taliban might both be spent forces, there are bigger and more dangerous forces now coming into focus. Chief among those are Pakistan, India and the People's Republic of China. All three of these are nuclear powers and all three are involved with the United States and other regional Asian powers in a delicate balance of power play.<br /><br />Although the Korean peninsula and Taiwan are the most immediate strategic places of consequence for Japan, because Kashmir, Wirsing's area of expertise, has been a major flashpoint since 1949, Japan, like the world at large, ignores it at its peril.  The difference between past conflicts over Kashmir and any future one is that both India and Pakistan now have the capacity to give us a fully fledged nuclear war and China, which always keeps a weather eye on India, might join in as well. The result, needless to say, would be apocalyptic.<br /><br />The low intensity alternative - whereby units of Pakistani Intelligence fund and run Islamic terror groups - which Wirsing also explores at some length, does not seem any better. Although India is a fractious country, it seems to be infinitely more stable than Pakistan, which tends to have too many military officers who, when they are not engineering coups, believe in robust responses on issues like Kashmir. These same generals promoted the Taliban takeover of neighboring Afghanistan and now that their Afghan allies are gone into the garbage can of history, Wirsing explains that they have to face the prospect of India gaining the upper hand diplomatically and economically in Afghanistan and all of Central Asia.  Kashmir, he explains, is the joker in their deck of cards; it allows them to keep India wrong footed and on the defensive. Given that India has an overwhelming military capability and that Pakistan's only trump card is a nuclear first strike, the stakes are obviously sky high.<br /><br />The author points out that the defeat of their Taliban allies has caused Kashmir insurgents dearly. The Pakistani generals have been forced to back peddle not only on Afghanistan but on Kashmir as well. As a string of arrests of Islamic militants show, Pakistan has, however belatedly, joined America's crusade against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, their former allies. However, Pakistan's renunciation of terror groups makes it politically difficult for them to continue to support armed insurrection in Kashmir.<br /><br />Wirsing points out that, as long as the two belligerents can confine hostilities to Kashmir, the rest of the world would prefer to ignore the problem. However, he also points out that the United States' war on terrorism means that the problem will not be ignored. Although it will not be ignored, it probably will not be solved without a major conflict.

Bix, who was a history professor at Tokyo's Hitotsubashi University when he published this tome.<br /><br />The book has a simple thesis. The late emperor Hirohito was centrally involved in planning and prosecuting the Pacific war and should be held accountable even now for it. As part of this process, Bix would also like Yasukuni Shrine, one of Japan's three most important Shinto shrines, stripped of whatever militaristic and nationalistic symbolism it possesses. Bix is undoubtedly a good historian. But is he right? And is he fair? Probably not.<br /><br />When 360 Japanese planes sank 90% of America's Pacific fleet moored in Pearl Harbour on Sunday, 7 December 1941, the Japanese bit off more than they could ever chew. The attack, which was modeled on the British attack on the Italian fleet a few months earlier, sank five battleships, two cruisers, three destroyers and two other naval vessels moored at Pearl Harbour. A further one hundred and seventy five planes were destroyed on Hickman Airfield. Only 28 Japanese planes were lost. Unfortunately for the Japanese, the Pacific Fleet's three aircraft carriers had not been in port and were not hunted down afterwards. These three aircraft carriers, joined by two others, eventually spearheaded the American counter attack. Admiral Isoruku Yamamoto's string of early successes ended only six months later at the Battle of Midway.<br /><br />Even though Japan's navy was in the ascendant for only six months, the picture, even in the immediate aftermath of Pearl Harbour, was bleak. An early attack on Ceylon was repulsed by the wily cat and mouse tactics of the largely obsolete British Far Eastern fleet under Admiral Sir James Somerville; he engaged in hit and run tactics against a superior Japanese flotilla. As a consequence, Britain only had to defend India in Burma. Japan, in other words, was already getting boxed in. They would have to fight the war on ground chosen by their enemies. The war, even then, was unwinnable.<br /><br />Unlike the Allies, Japan did not have a viable strategy. Despite Bix's attempts to paint Hirohito out as Nippon's supreme commander, he was no Eisenhower or MacArthur. He was the Emperor of a nation run by a bunch of feuding fools, who rushed headlong into a war they could never hope to win.<br /><br />The Japanese of that generation paid a terrible price for their leaders' folly. Over 100,000 Tokyo citizens were incinerated from March 9-10 1945, when the United States Air Force carpeted the city with incendiary bombs. Even as Truman announced Japan's unconditional surrender, Tokyo was flattened by a further 1,000 planes, just, one supposed, to let the world know who was boss - unsurprisingly enough, given the scale of Japan's devastation, all 1,000 planes returned safely to base to celebrate VJ Day. By then, a third of Hirohito's surviving subjects were homeless, 65% of all Tokyo residences were destroyed - 89% of Nagoya was in ruins. Over 500,000 Japanese troops had been dragooned into Siberian slave camps. Some 2 million others had also died - Yasukuni houses a goodly number of those sad souls, whose lives were cut short by the madness that then gripped Japan's leaders. But at least the madness of that war ended.<br /><br />Hirohito's surrender was a cruel awakening for himself as well as for all his subjects and only a fool would say that the trauma is over for the relatives of all the fallen. The protests by Japan's wartime victims, which rocked Britain on Emperor Akihito's recent visit, is evidence enough of that. Korea, China and the Philippines provide plenty more.<br /><br />Bix is not a fool. He is a Harvard-trained historian, who includes almost 100 pages of largely superfluous footnotes in this massive tome. Yet the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal report was much bigger. And, unlike Bix, most historians and lawyers agree that it was a travesty of justice. Bix produces plenty of well-worn evidence against Hirohito, as well as some new findings as befitting his scholarly calling. But does it matter? Probably not, unless you are a professional historian. And if you are, you should probably give Stalin's judge a more prominent role than Bix does. You should also extend to the independent stance adopted by Radhabinod Pal, India's representative, more respect than Bix does. You should also give the British - and the Poles - more credit than Bix does for Hitler's defeat. They, not FDR, were Hitler's most implacable enemies; they were the only two nations which engaged in the fight without stint from start to finish. One only has to recall Churchill's most famous speeches to agree that no one was more implacably opposed to Hitler than he was.<br /><br />Perhaps that is a mere quibble to be expected from reading a book as vast as this one. However, there are several more. Although, for example, Bix presents a strong case against Hirohito, the author's most striking snippet of evidence favours the defense, not the prosecution. His first picture of the former emperor shows Hirohito as a brave and bonny babe waving the Rising Sun flag on his first birthday. That flag was to haunt the little boy ever since. It was to be almost his only companion.<br /><br />He had few others. When he was only three months' old, he was taken away from his seventeen-year-old mother. He had no childhood games or friends. He was not allowed access even to his own brothers. His only companion was General Nogi Maresuke, the hero of Japan's formative 1905 Russian war, who committed hara kiri when the little boy was only seven. Aside from his wife, the Empress Nagako, his only social outlet was reviewing his assault troops from his pedigree white charger. Because the little boy grew up to have a strange, long, lonely and somehow unfulfilled life, perhaps he should be allowed, like those in Yasukuni, to sleep in peace. He'll be doing somersaults if Bix has his way.<br /><br />Although Bix has done a good stitch-up, it is akin to another book on Diana or the Queen Mother. There is nothing major here that John Dower or other historians have not already told us. Although the book does shed valuable light on the past, throwing stones, however deservedly, at a revered emperor does not lead to parity of esteem. The challenge is to rise above the partisan venalities of history and to put an end not only to all wars but to their causes as well.<br /><br />The Japanese, Hirohito's direct descendants included, have a key role to play in that process. Japan's challenge is to make amends for the grave mistakes of the past. Japan's politicians must chart the future. And to do that, they must learn the lessons and dynamics of history so that Japan and her neighbours never have the nightmare of war revisit them. This big book will be a very small but very important help in that regard.<br /><br />Following Bix' award, this book was widely available in Japan.

As the author explains, the Nobel Prize's combination of wealth, pomp and prestige lends it greater credibility than, say, The Fields medal, awarded every four years by the International Mathematical Union, which is much harder to win.<br /><br />Scandal has also helped.  The tale of Marie Curie, a double Nobel Prize winner, whose amazing rags to riches story was taken up by the French media, helped to spread the fame of the Nobel awards during the crucial early years. Curie won her prizes while nursing her child - and simultaneously having a brief affair with a fellow French physicist.  After Planck, Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Dirac, Pauling, Feynman and similar intellectual giants were also honored, the prestige of the Nobel Prize in Physics was assured forever.<br /><br />The same cannot be said for the other prizes. Hitler was proposed for the Nobel Peace Prize - for not invading Austria in 1934. Around the same time, Charlie Chaplin was proposed for the Literature prize. Leo Tolstoy, James Joyce, Emile Zola, Mark Twain, Heinrik Ibsen, August Strinberg, Henry Adams, Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad, Marcel Proust, Franz Kafka, Anton Chekhov, Gertrude Stein, Eugene Ionesco and Virginia Woolf were all denied the prize.<br /><br />For anyone hoping to win the prize, it helps to have a good Swedish translation - better still if you are Swedish. Scandinavians have won the Literature Prize some fourteen times in all. The fact that one-seventh of all Nobel Literature prizes have gone to their compatriots is evidence, no doubt, of the comparative superiority of Nordic writing. Either that or it is a fix!<br /><br />Although Gandhi never won the Peace Prize, other equally eminent people have been so honored. These include Henri Dunant, who founded the International Red Cross; Fridtjof Nansen, a Norwegian Arctic explorer, oceanographer and tireless peace activist; and Carl von Ossietzky, who got the prize in 1935 - he was incarcerated a Nazi concentration camp at the time.<br /><br />Although the history of the economics prize is also documented, the author, like several of its recipients, believes it should be discontinued. Because the winners are dominated by lecturers at the University of Chicago, the prize is widely regarded as nothing more than a cozy sinecure for an incestuous bunch of American academics. The author strongly suggests that some of them - Gary Becker, Robert Fogel and Douglass North in particular - are little more than academic charlatans.<br /><br />Although the economics prize has proved problematic, the chemistry prize has also led to controversy, most notably when Fritz Haber won the prize in 1918 for his ammonia process. Along with five other future German Nobelists, he had previously used the same process to develop poison gas for use in the trench warfare of World War 1. Ironically, because Haber, who was a staunch German patriot, also happened to be a Jew, he had to flee for his life to Britain when Hitler took over.<br /><br />Max Planck, the Galileo of quantum physics, remained and the sad story of this gentle soul is also recounted here. His elder son was killed in action during the Great War; his only other son was implicated in the 1944 attempt to assassinate Hitler and was summarily executed as a result.<br /><br />Such sad tales are interspersed with quirky anecdotes we lesser mortals expect to hear about such luminaries. Richard Feynman, for example, used to frequent topless bars; he found them conducive to solving complex mathematical equations. Werner Heisenberg received his Nobel Prize only seven years after almost failing his doctoral examinations. The dogfight that developed between the Canadian discoverers of insulin also makes lively and informative reading. The author recounts many such snippets about such greats as Bohr, Dirac and the great Albert Einstein, whose brain was put on public display after he died.<br /><br />Feldman has given an enjoyable, readable and informative book. Not worthy of a Nobel Prize, perhaps, but thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless!in, whose brain was put on public display after he died.  <br />Feldman has given an enjoyable, readable and informative book.

Jephson resigned shortly after she admitted on British TV to having an extra-marital affair with James Hewitt, an unconscionable rake who later sold his story to the British tabloids. Like Jephson, he also left her just when she needed him most. Left defenseless, the British tabloids turned her into their plaything. In the words of Earl Spencer, they made her the most hunted entity on the entire planet. Now she is denied peace even in death.<br /><br />Prince Charles, of course, should have married Camilla Parker Bowles instead of making himself and Diana go through their respective ordeals for England, home and beauty. Even though the end result was a dysfunctional family unparalleled since Tolstoy wrote Anna Karinina, their trials should have remained their own private business. Royalty, pop stars and the other icons the popular press feed on have their rights as human beings too. The bedroom, like the rest of an Englishwoman's castle, should be off limits to prying eyes.<br /><br />Shakespeare, of course, wrote about such families. Many of his plays are based on the lives of earlier British Royals. The Bard had a way with words. He could even instill humanity into such rakes as Richard 111 by enveloping his love of wine with a certain wry humor. Jephson aims much lower.<br /><br />He tells us that Diana loved dirty jokes and that she liked to binge on secret stashes of chocolate. She slept around with almost any macho upper class Englishman she could come across, she was disgustingly cruel to Tiggy Legge-Bourke, her children's nanny and she cherry-picked the world's charities to find those celebrity causes that would best inflate her own poor self-image. She was fascinated by the forbidden - drug dealers, lepers, land mine victims - and bored and disgusted by Britain's ordinary people, who later all but beatified her. Diana didn't like the Royal Family either. She referred to them as \\"The Germans\\" and dismissed Prince Philip, the Queen's husband, as \\"Stavros the Greek.\\" These pitiful revelations just tell us what Diana herself was telling anyone who would listen. She was unhappy in her marriage, she felt stifled and she wanted out. She seemed to be finding some belated happiness with Dodi Fayed, who was killed along with her in that fateful 1997 crash. Prince Philip, in particular, was supposedly furious at her relationship with a \\"foreigner\\". That was then.<br /><br />This is now. Conspiracy theorists, pandering to the heartbreak of Dodi's father and other gullible people, can blame her untimely death on the British secret service, allude to the similarities with the \\"mysterious\\" 1992 death of Czechoslovak dissident Alexander Dubcek and do all the other necessary things to make a mystery out of this woman's tragic life and death. The truth is more prosaic. Diana was living in the fast lane and, sadly, paid the ultimate price. Trying to escape from an unhappy marriage and her rather dour \\"Germanic\\" in-laws, she ended up returning to her ancestral home in a box.<br /><br />That is not what the Queen and her family wanted. They have rightly protested that the book will cause distress to Diana's children. The Queen personally appealed to Jephson to honor the confidentiality clause he signed in 1995. Jephson has instead chosen to publish and, at least in the eyes of the British sovereign he purports to be still serving with this book, perish. Jephson's protestations that he wrote only positive things about Diana's relationship with her two children just does not make the cut. The truth is that she tried to be a good mother in trying circumstances - Fergie, the Duchess of York, bailed out when she saw how corseted her life had become from the opposing pressures of her in-laws and the media. Those same pressures also took their toll on Diana.<br /><br/>Diana, like all mothers under pressure, could have done with some help. She will get precious little from Jephson's well-crafted book. He, in contrast, stands to make over $1 million in advances alone. Shakespeare, who also made some money from his pen, might have summed up this book thus: \\"She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived\\".

None of those is more important than the questions this excellent book addresses. Is nicotine a narcotic? Are America's major cigarette companies, collectively known as Big Tobacco, deliberately turning their customers into nicotine addicts?<br /><br />They were the key questions David Kessler tackled when he was Commissioner of America's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 1990 to 1997. Kessler, who is now Dean of the Yale University Law School, fought a tenacious battle with Big Tobacco and its powerful allies on Capitol Hill during those years. The battle was so tough and Big Tobacco so ruthless that Kessler and his small team were often compared to Elliot Ness and his small band of Untouchables who slugged it out with Al Capone's army of gangsters and corrupt politicians during the Prohibition years.<br /><br />Certainly, the tenacity of Big Tobacco in the face of overwhelming evidence that damns its product can only remind the reader of Al Capone and America's Organized Crime, whose sole god is ill gotten money. Big Tobacco practiced, for example, the code of Omerta and, if Kessler is to be believed, former employees who gave evidence against them lived in fear of their lives. Big Tobacco had armies of lawyers and US Congressmen in their corporate pockets. All they seemed short of was organizing the gangland-style hits that were Capone's specialty.<br /><br />Indeed, the specters of Ness and Capone are never too far away. Kessler hired special investigators trained by America's elite combat forces to interrogate witnesses. One member of Kessler's squad trawled all of America's seaports to uncover key evidence that Big Tobacco had illegally imported genetically modified tobacco into the United States. The book is, in many ways, a classic detective story needing only Humphrey Bogart, Jimmy Cagney, Tom Hanks or some other celluloid figure to bring it to life. It races along from the very first page to the final denouement.<br /><br />Big Tobacco's four-pronged counter-strategy against the FDA is also equally fast-paced. Working with military precision, it used, as page 169 tells us, frontal assaults, surgical strikes, allied attacks and air cover to overwhelm the offices and efforts of Kessler and his team. Like Organized Crime, Big Tobacco knew what side its bread was buttered on. Like Organized Crime, Big Tobacco's bosses proved themselves to be ruthless and cynical competitors with pitiless cash registers for hearts. Their proud boast was that they had more money than God.<br /><br />Their vast war chests poisoned public debate in America for many years just as their product continues to poison the bodies of their fellow Americans. As well as the armies of hired lawyers who were central to their strategy, they employed mercenary academics to rubber-stamp their products with a scientific sheen of respectability. The aura of scientific impartiality these academics bartered away helped Big Tobacco's bosses accumulate their almost limitless wealth, buy their way into Capitol Hill and jam the world's hospital cancer wards full with cigarette smokers. Although Kessler names some of these contemptible researchers, he goes much further. By exposing their mercenary motives, he discredits them and Big Tobacco, which paid them their ultimately puny pieces of silver.<br /><br />The book, despite its topicality, starts off with a quote from the Odes of Horace, which tells us that \\"The guilty have a head start, and retribution is always slow of start, but it catches up.\\" Fortunately, the net is finally beginning to close in on Big Tobacco and its tainted allies. Thanks to people like Kessler and his team of Untouchables, the nicotine debate is starting to be aired out into the open.<br /><br />Sometimes, of course, the cure is worse than the disease. Kessler's comments about nicotine nasal sprays should beenough to make anyone feel pity for the nicotine abuser and disgust at the companies which can conceive, let alone peddle such an obnoxious product.<br /><br />No sympathy whatsoever can be spared for Kessler's villains. Though bloodied, Big Tobacco is far from bowed. It continues to ensnare American schoolchildren with its product and to export its deadly product to the four ends of the earth. Despite Big Tobacco's enviable revenues, its feet of clay and the tissues of lies it surrounds itself with have both been well exposed by this great book, which President Jimmy Carter and a host of other luminaries endorse. The hope must now be, as Kessler puts it, that Big Tobacco will eventually be drummed out of business altogether. Their demise would not only make the air we breathe cleaner. It would also help clean up the corridors of power, which Big Tobacco so thoroughly infected with its own insatiable addiction to the profit motive.prays should be enough to make anyone feel pity for the nicotine abuser and disgust at the companies which can conceive, let alone peddle such an obnoxious product.   <br /> <br />No sympathy whatsoever can be spared for Kessler's villains.

All potential partners fill in a simple form listing the names and addresses of all their living relatives so these urbane men know whom to knock off, if they are double-crossed.<br /><br />Not that the Colombian cocaine cartels are the world's only baddies. The Mohawk Warriors smuggle $1 bn worth of contraband across the American Canadian frontier every year. And, in today's age of globalized mergers, they work with all comers, from the Cali cartel and Chinese snakeheads to the Russian gangsters, who dominate this book.<br /><br />Former Russian leader Boris Yeltsin is quoted as saying that \\"Russia is the biggest Mafia state in the world\\". It is certainly the most dangerous. Although Moscow, from 1991 to 1999, has witnessed thousands of contract killings, no one has ever been successfully prosecuted for any of them.<br /><br />And these gangsters are headed our way in big numbers. And these Russians have some interesting friends. Marc Rich, recently pardoned by Bill Clinton, is mentioned in the book, for doing deals with the Russians and trading in conflict diamonds with the Liberians. Robinson claims that Grigory Loutchansky also donated to Clinton's coffers; he is allegedly the world's most important dealer in black-market nuclear materials. He was considered important enough to be the subject of a 1995 eleven-nation, two-day conference hosted by Interpol. Sergei Mikhailov, who has accumulated a staggering array of passports, including a diplomatic passport for Costa Rica, is probably worth another conference.<br /><br />So too is the damage these people cause at all levels of society. As well as shaking down American based Russian hockey and basketball players, peddling guns, girls and gambling and putting contracts out on over zealous FBI agents, Robinson contends that Russia's gangsters are also undermining sovereign nations like Israel.<br /><br />Israel's Law of Return has allowed thousands of Russian gangsters, both Jewish and non Jewish, to establish themselves in Israel. Because Israel does not extradite its citizens, it is a perfect hiding hole for these ruthless racketeers, who have a staggering war chest of $4 billion to buy political influence there.<br /><br />If Robinson is to believed, the Russian mafia more or less control both the Greek and Turkish parts of Cyprus. They also seem to be well entrenched in London, New York, Geneva, Vienna and the world's other major financial centers. The FBI and other law enforcement agencies, meanwhile, struggle to catch even the small fry.<br /><br />Other countries, the Caribbean ones in particular, long ago sold their souls to the international criminals, who use them to launder their billions. Still, even Dutch controlled Aruba, the world's first mafia state, never went quite as far as the Seychelles, which offered internationally recognized diplomatic passports, plus guaranteed immunity on the island from any form of extradition requested by any other nation, for a mere $10 million. There were plenty of takers, until the tiny nation was forced to withdraw its generous offer of diplomatic immunity to the world's most ruthless criminals.<br /><br />Not that the Seychelles matter much. The Russian criminal gangs, the Colombians, the Mohawks and the rest of them are uniting in their drive to maximize their global profits no matter what the social cost. And, in today's globalized age, the West contributes to their excesses by buying their contraband, renting out their sex slaves and gambling in their shady casinos. And all their ill-gotten profits are used to traffic more human cargo and move more tons of heroin across our porous borders.<br /><br />And then there are the nuclear bomb peddlers, another legacy of the Soviet Union's collapse. There is, as Robinson tells us, enough unaccounted-for fissile material that once belonged to the Soviet armed forces to turn Europe and the United States into a moonscape. Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and similar people have shown that there is a demand for this material.<br /><br />Until we can dampen that demand, we must be prepared to live with the dismal consequences these suppliers of human misery beget. Not, by any stretch, a pleasant thought, but a realistic one nonetheless.rmed forces to turn Europe and the United States into a moonscape.

Bowen details how kingmakers like Nakasone who specialized in secret, backroom deals made Japan the dysfunctional democracy that it is.<br /><br />He shows us that \\"power, the ability to deliver pork - not ethical behavior - is what Japanese voters reward.\\" Because the ability to bring home the bacon is imperative, the Japanese Communist Party, which has never been able to get close to the trough, is essentially powerless and irrelevant in Japan. For much the same reason, the author believes that Koizumi Junichiro, the current prime minister, will be dumped by the LDP kingmakers when the time is right. The prime minister is, Bowen alleges, a more figurehead, a puppet controlled by the kingmakers who stay out of public view and, therefore, out of public scrutiny.<br /><br />The book also explains such things as why the election of prime minister is usually rigged, how the Japanese constitution is largely irrelevant to Japanese politics, how and why Japan's bureaucrats are so important and why the pre war inheritance of authoritarianism, fascism and imperialism remain vital keys to understanding the modern Japanese political system.<br /><br />Despite his clear elucidation of all these points, the author also reminds us on pages 99/100 that the Japanese economy is \\"the world's second largest, the Japanese people live longer, healthier lives than Americans, its people are one of the world's most literate and well-read, its social welfare structure is one of the world's most advanced, its economic system is one of the world's freest.\\"<br /><br />Japan, in other words, is, on balance, an economic, social and political success. Although modern Japan is not a model of Athenian democracy, yet it must be noted that neither is the United States or any other major world power. The Japanese people elect, by and large, members of the Liberal Democratic Party to parliament and they, working in tandem with the country's bureaucrats, give them what they want: a more hi tech version of the bread and circuses formula so beloved by Roman emperors, who were not the world's greatest exponents of the democratic ideal either.<br /><br />In building his thesis that Japanese democracy is dysfunctional, he quotes far too many polls. But, as any politician could tell him, the only poll that really counts is the one that happens via the ballot box on election day. And despite the very valid and important points made in this valuable book, the LDP will probably have little to fear from that poll for many years to come. Therefore, although Bowen's book is a good exposition of the problems inherent in Japanese democracy, because there is little new or novel in it, the LDP's kingmakers will not lose any sleep over it.ism and imperialism remain vital keys to understanding the modern Japanese political system. <br />Despite his clear elucidation of all these points, the author also reminds us on pages 99/100 that the Japanese economy is \\"the world's second largest, the Japanese people live longer, healthier lives than Americans, its people are one of the world's most literate and well-read, its social welfare structure is one of the world's most advanced, its economic system is one of the world's freest.\\"  <br />Japan, in other words, is, on balance, an economic, social and political success.

When she died in 1996 at the age of 87, she had already become a national legend.<br /><br />This award-winning autobiography brings her earlier, more formative years in Tokyo's Asakusa district to life. Though Asakusa's poverty is gone, the graciousness, which accompanied it, will continue to live for many years yet as a result of her outstanding penmanship. Sawamura, in throwing rays of light on the Tokyo of her youth, also illuminates many key cultural aspects of modern Japan, which is, after all, largely a product of those bygone days.<br /><br />Sawamura, whose family was well connected with the area's leading kabuki actors, brings us directly into the epicenter of this country's rich culture. The young Sadako had to submit to the realities of genteel poverty. She had to learn to cook, sew and generally fit into the flow of things in the neighborhood. She was being conditioned to be dependent on a man - even as many of her older sisters were warning her of the many perils such dependence on Asakusa's fickle men brings. Importantly though, she kept her spirit's dreams alive and, in this book, we see how she nurtured them along while retaining the countless benefits of her rather Spartan upbringing. The same applies particularly to her mother but also to her long gone neighbors as well. The author brings their warmth, their decency and their sheer delight in the simplest of pleasures alive in a way that can only melt your heart.<br /><br />Sawamura, however, is no naive romanticist. As well as recounting many warm tales about how her parents and neighbors shaped her inner beliefs, she also paints the struggles of the area's indentured prostitutes to escape their inhumane fate. She deftly describes her father's many infidelities and other acts of personal betrayal that impinged on her. She describes aging geishas and other neighbors fallen on hard times and she recounts how her mother and their long-suffering neighbors shared what little they had with them. She paints the triumphs and travails of an over-romanticized community struggling against the tides of poverty and social elitism.<br /><br />Customs, long since forgotten, resurface in this book. Thus, because needlework is no longer so important to secure a husband, women no longer deify Awashimasama, the goddess of needlework. Likewise, the Memorial Service for Needles has, along with the endemic poverty that begot the custom, long since faded into history. However, other things have not. The more intangible influences, which shaped the young Sadako Sawamura, remain. Today's local communities must also have a modus vivendi. We must get on with our neighbors just as much as Sawamura's family had to all those years ago. There are, in other words, scores of lessons pertinent both to modern Japan and life in general to be learned from this joyful book.<br /><br />Indeed, the book starts with an excellent one. The young Sadako buys bruised tangerines because that is all her mother, given the large number of children she had to feed, can most prudently afford. She makes the point that no one regarded this as being odd or as an opportunity to score cheap points off those in straitened circumstances. People, in other words, as well as being socially responsible, were also independent and respectful in their minds and actions. That is a good thing.<br /><br />There are many other good things in this book. Though circumstances change, people do not. Girls still flirt with boys, mothers still fret over their children, the milk of human kindness is still ladled out in generous proportions, in short, life's lovely heartbeat continues its unalterable flow into the future. And, though many things change on the surface, the truly important things stay constant. That ineffable quality in all of us, which impels us to laud those who kick against life's pricks, is one such immutable constant. The world is a better and brighter place because Sadako Sawamura not only lived in it but also because her pen has brought Asakusa's people and their universal hopes and problems so vividly to life on the printed page.t life's pricks, is one such immutable constant.

With the help of more than 1,300 great pictures, the 340,000-word text, most of which is from the four Beatles themselves, brings us from their earliest days as four ordinary Liverpool blokes up to the end of the group, when they remained, by and large, the same four ordinary Liverpool blokes who had survived the fame and fortune that ruined many of their contemporaries.<br /><br />The earlier chapters, which describe their Liverpool upbringings, are accompanied by some particularly great photos - Paul playing in a country and western band, John playing at a church bazaar, Ringo playing the squeeze box and George playing almost anywhere he can. From Liverpool, it is off to Hamburg, where John claims to have grown up, then back to Liverpool's Cavern Club and on to stardom, via a gig in Aldershot where only 18 people showed up to watch them play. They were a typical overnight sensation - after they put in years of hard toil.<br /><br />When world fame eventually arrived, the pressure didn't ease off. They had the Ku Klux Klan stalking them in the Deep South, L.A. Hell's Angels descending like vultures on their London studios and Imelda Marcos giving them a living hell in Manila because of an imagined slight to her vanity. And they had their huge tours of America and the world which all of them point out was hard work, eight days a week every week.<br /><br />Still, out of that toil came great music, which has given the world untold happiness. The book adds to that joy in the same way that a favorite family photo album does; it is a wonderful magical, mystery tour down the brighter side of the 1960s and 1970s from the viewpoint of four guys who, in John's word, \\"were in the crow's nest\\" of a visionary ship trying to discover newer, brighter and better world views for us all to live in. The pictures of them getting their MBEs are particularly evocative of the era. The burly British Bobbies charged with holding back their delirious fans are also clearly enjoying themselves. The Queen Mother apparently tapped along to their tunes. They too were integral parts of the Beatlemania that, in Paul's words, helped put British Minis, British Jaguars and Mary Quandt designs back on the international map.<br /><br />And the Beatles were to the forefront of the globalization of the pop industry. Their first, somewhat surreal meetings with Elvis, Bob Dylan and the other super stars of the early 1960s are chronicled. So too is their constant puzzlement at the interest world leaders such as Charles De Gaulle and Nikita Khrushchev, of all people, expressed in them. And keeping the tempo of this massive book at the proper pitch is the music, which bound them together as the world's greatest ever rock and roll band. This goes from even before their first huge hit, Please Please Me - influenced, as they explain, by Roy Orbison and Bing Crosbie, of all people - down to Abbey Road and Let It Be, which were their last collaborative acts.<br /><br />And in between these cultural classics are many others. The Fab Four explain how Michelle, Sgt Pepper, Eleanor Rigby, Yellow Submarine and their other successes saw the light of day. Although John and Paul were the main songwriters, George and Ringo get their fair due as well for their own great songs.<br /><br />Yoko Ono is also given her fair due. Herself and John are pictured in a full frontal during their honeymoon sleep in for world peace. So too are such hoots as the Austrian interview John and Yoko gave - from inside a giant bag. Their biggest excesses seem so charmingly juvenile today.<br /><br />The same, happily, cannot be said for their music. This is all the more so as we see the work that went into producing them. The Abbey Road album is a great exemplar. The photo shoot of walking across the zebra crossing should have been no big deal. However, the clothes Paul and Ringo wore, together with the Volkswagen Beetle parked nearby, sparked a major rumor that Paul McCartney was dead! Of course, soon afterwards, the Beatles as a group, ceased to exist. All good things, they say, must come to end.<br /><br />However, memories live and the last few pages are given over to their individual reminiscences of their collective contribution to our common evolution. Paul is \\"really glad that most of the songs dealt with love, peace, understanding\\" and that there was nothing inherently destructive in any of their work. John explains that he is really glad that, along with their fans, he grew up and reached maturity during those musically golden years. George says that he hopes the screaming teenagers who pursued them all during the 1960s still retain \\"a place in their hearts\\" for the Beatles. Of course, we do. As Ringo, who gets the last word in the main text says, \\"the basic Beatles message was Love\\". Although love is probably all you need, this book - and a good Beatles CD collection - may help to cement your own sweet love and Beatlemania memories for many, many more years to come.the Volkswagen Beetle parked nearby, sparked a major rumor that Paul McCartney was dead!

He has also written about St. Augustine, who figures much too prominently in this book.<br /><br />Norwegian Nazi collaborators also figure. Page 305 of the book quotes Matthew, 21-31 to have Jesus saying, \\"Quislings and whores are entering the Kingdom before you\\". Perhaps this is what the book's blurb means by telling us that Wills looks at old discussions in a new light.<br /><br />Although Wills certainly puts a new spin on old themes, he occasionally throws some new light on them as well. He begins with the Polish Pope's efforts to beatify Edith Stein, Maximilian Kolbe and Titus Brandsma, all of whom died in Nazi concentration camps. Because the Pope was a Pole and because the Poles of his generation were amongst Hitler's major victims, it is natural that John Paul 11 should concern himself with such issues. In so much as his actions keep man's inhumanity to man to the fore, the Pope should be encouraged to beatify such people. Catholics would be much better employed praying to such people than emulating their tormentors. And the world would be a much better place if people prayed more and killed less.<br /><br />Wills spends considerable time castigating Paul V1 for his Humanae Vitae encyclical, which has been wrongly painted as a major PR disaster. Paul V1 followed John XX111, who reigned in the heady years of Vatican 11, JFK's Camelot, James Bond, French bikinis and the new, apparently fresher approach to the world those cultural icons all epitomized. Paul tried to assert older values as he saw them. Those older values are hard to articulate, never mind to maintain, in today's world. Many of them, of course, are not worth maintaining. It is like trying to practice Gregorian chants at a U2 concert: one will not be heard and one probably should not be heard.<br /><br />Perhaps that is the core of the pope's dilemma. Surely today's pope and his closest sycophants should be able to concisely summarize their claims to historical legitimacy without having constant recourse to Augustine, Ambrose, Matthew and the Quislings. If the pope purports to express universal truths in today's changing times, to be a moral compass, however inexact, in a godless age, the task should be all the easier. Surely he has enough under worked bishops, priests and down trodden nuns on hand in Rome to state his case clearly and concisely. Most lay people are too busy with their own problems to care what Augustine, Ambrose and Thomas Aquinas thought of the obsolete societies they lived in. Most people, the Catholic Church's leaders included, should primarily address themselves to today's scandals, not to the altercations Peter, Paul, Mary and the Quislings engaged in.<br /><br />Chief of these modern Catholic scourges is the issue of child abuse. Pope Benedict should set himself the urgent task of rectifying, as far as is practicable, such ungodly scandals. The Vatican should abandon the silly misogynistic ideas of Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas and their ilk and move on. They should make amends for the sins of the present before they address themselves to the irrelevant arguments of the past.<br /><br />The Vatican should decide where it wants to stand on issues such as annulments, the so-called Catholic divorce that make a mockery both of the marriage vow as well as the Church's opposition to divorce; child abuse, general sexual abuse and alcohol abuse as well as all the structures of deceit that allow these abominations to fester. Although many Catholics will read this book to highlight its considerable flaws, a more fundamental reappraisal of their church's position in the modern world would serve their cause better. Until that is done, they will only marginalize themselves and their religion further from the mainstream of modern life. Although they can easily shoot the messenger, they should pay belated attention to Wills' central messages that the Catholic Church needs a major overhaul.o Wills' central messages that the Catholic Church needs a major overhaul. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-01

Russia has launched two major wars to bring the rebels to heel since then. This action-packed book describes the first campaign, the 1994-96 war, which caused 60,000 fatalities and a host of human rights violations. The second one is continuing and the death toll has already surpassed that of Russia's first, failed campaign. Human rights violations are today in Chechnya as common place as they were in the first campaign. This seminal book therefore remains relevant to trying to understand one of the world's most violent regions.<br /><br />The authors are two journalists who spent almost a year in the killing fields of Chechnya collecting their research material in between dodging the bombs and the bullets. Although the book focuses on the main antagonists of the first war, including Boris Yeltsin and Johkar Dudayev, the late charismatic leader of the Chechens, it also performs several other useful functions. It traces the origins of the enmity between the Russians and the Chechens back to Russia's imperial expansions in the 1830s. Stalin's ruthless deportations of 1944 are also given their due prominence; Stalin believed the Chechens collaborated with the Nazis and deported all of them from the northern Caucasus. Although Khrushchev later allowed them to return, the Chechens have retained a deep loathing of Moscow ever since. There is no love lost here.<br /><br />Moscow is in no financial or moral shape to buy the Chechens off. It has instead opted for a military solution. However, a military solution calls for disciplined assault troops, the type of soldiers who pushed the Nazis back from Moscow to Berlin. This is all the more so when faced with the caliber of resistance the Chechens present. However, Russia's armed forces no longer possesses such men. The army's officers and men are an undisciplined, under-paid hotchpotch of young conscripts and incompetent malcontents, who have no burning desire to die for Mother Russia.<br /><br />The authors draw attention to the human rights violations Russia's conscript army routinely commits. Indiscriminate killings, kidnappings and robberies are daily occurrences. The Russians are more interested in collecting bribes than in fighting the war to its conclusion. This allows the rebels the necessary degree of latitude to pursue their objectives. They operate in shifts, alternating between living as civilians and as partisans. There is no evidence in this book that this unhappy cycle will end in the near future. The Chechens are geared up for the long haul.<br /><br />Stalin, who crushed the Chechens in his own brutal way, was well aware of the Chechens' military prowess. He once famously quipped that a handful of Chechens would be enough to defeat Hitler. When the current war in Chechnya ends, there might only be a handful of them left. But they will have exacted a terrible price on their Russian enemies. Putin cannot resort to Stalin's total terror tactics. He must deal with outside pressures. Although Western concerns about human rights abuses are one of these, there is another which the authors could possibly have spent more time discussing.<br /><br />Chechnya has wider dimensions, chief of which are the region's growing adherence to Islamic fundamentalism and the need of the Russians for a safe southern underbelly. When the Soviets rashly invaded Afghanistan in 1979, they initiated a process that led to the destruction of their own empire. That process is continuing most forcefully in the Caucasus where ethnic and sectarian tensions abound. Russia has few allies in the area. There are the hard-pressed Armenians and the Georgians, who are obsessed with their own problems. And there are not many more.<br /><br />Although Russia must pacify the Caucasus, this book does not offer them much hope. Quite the opposite in fact. The forces of history seem to be on the side of the Islamic fighters in Chechnya and neighboring countries. However unpalatable that may be to some of us, it is the conclusion of this book and of any impartial adjudication of the evidence seeping out from Russia's latest unwinnable war.table that may be to some of us, it is the conclusion of this book and of any impartial adjudication of the evidence seeping out from Russia's latest unwinnable war.  <br />	2005-10-01

Because this is not the case in Russia, any information we can get on President Vladimir Putin has to be particularly welcome. First Person, the product of six interviews conducted by Russian journalists with the Russian leader, gives us that information in Putin's own words.<br /><br />Putin likes beer and dislikes Chechen separatists; he is saddened by Stalin's excesses and proud of his own work in the KGB; he is sorry that the Soviet Union put Hungary and Czechoslovakia to the sword but delighted that today's glorious Russian Army is teaching the Chechens a lesson. Putin, like Mother Russia herself, is a mass of contradictions.<br /><br />Unlike Boris Yeltsin, Putin is a sober and industrious man. This is no bad thing in a land where vodka abuse has slashed ten years off the life expectancy of the ordinary Russian since the collapse of the evil empire. Although abstemious, Putin frankly admits that he is, at heart, a product of Soviet indoctrination.<br /><br />This is not that surprising from someone who worked for the KGB for 20 years and ended up taking over Yeltsin's entire secret service network. Russia today is as shadowy and secretive as it was when John Le Carre wrote his novels about Putin's KGB workmates. In those days, the KGB were our definite bad guys. Now however, the Russian Mafia have made the big league, the Caucasus are in flames and the Russian nuclear navy is more a threat to its crewmen than it is to the United States and her allies. Times have changed.<br /><br />Russia is in obvious need of law and order. Traditionally, law and order was achieved in Russia by generous applications of the heavy hand. Certainly, Lenin, Stalin and Peter the Great, Putin's hero, were never afraid to bite the bullet - or to use it for that matter. Putin can probably be no different. Russia is bankrupt, law and order has broken down, Yugoslavia and her other traditional allies have been brought low, neighboring Poland is on the verge of entering NATO and Islamic unrest is rising on her southern flanks. And Japan wants her Northern islands of Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and Habomai back.<br /><br />What is to be done? One solution would be to sell these islands back to the Japanese for the highest attainable price and to link it to massive Japanese aid for the Russian Far East. This would help to stem the demographic and military threats China poses to Siberia. A similar deal will probably have to be done with the United States. Russia will have to scrap her nuclear arsenal in return for another king's ransom and let NATO do as it pleases in the rest of Europe. Putin will have to surrender land and power projection capabilities for hard cash.<br /><br />With its flanks in some kind of order, Putin could then concentrate his resources on saving Russia. But there's the rub. Putin and the problems besetting him just do not have modern Western equivalents. The nearest American President to him is Honest Abe Lincoln, who, like Putin, also worked his way up from humble beginnings. Although Lincoln also fought a major war on his Southern flank to preserve his nation's unity, he had the advantage of being able to marshal a vibrant, disciplined and modern economy behind him. Putin has no such luxury. He has his KGB contacts, his dispirited army and, as the sinking of the Kursk showed, the world's media and human rights groups breathing down his neck. Putin must now worry about media ratings as well as Chechen suicide bombers.<br /><br />Even Putin's moral hold on power is tenuous enough. His Presidential campaign was beset by large-scale fraud. More than 1.3 million new voters appeared between the State Duma elections on 19 December 1999 and the presidential election in March 2000. These were not \\"dead souls\\", as described in Gogol's famous novel of that name, but \\"new-born souls\\" who were given the vote and who all voted for Putin. More than  50% of Chechens, who survived Putin's bombing campaign, also voted for him. Either that or the vote was rigged!<br /><br />Electoral fraud is only one of his more minor headaches. Putin must use books like this to don a human face much the same way that Al Gore and George W. Bush have to display their witticisms on the Oprah Winfrey show. American wannabe Presidents can joke and cajole their way through such shows - as can Japanese leaders like the late Mr. Obuchi. They can do this because they are leaders of modern and vibrant economies. This interesting book is the beginning of such a process in Russia. However, it would be best if Putin concentrated on his nation's many economic problems. Oprah Winfrey can wait.50% of Chechens, who survived Putin's bombing campaign, also voted for him.

The description, which belongs more in the Book of Revelations than in a chronicle of modern day health care, is stomach churning. Irula tribesmen are paid to catch the plague carrying rats - and are encouraged to eat their prey. The rats, being the breeding grounds for all conceivable types of plagues and pestilences that they are, quickly turn the Irula predators into their prey. Even as the yesinia pestis bacterium and its bubonic plague cousin were devastating the city, Surat's Aids-racked prostitutes continued to ply their trade. Life goes on, even in the midst of death.<br /><br />So, of course, do HIV and other killer microbes in environments like Surat where ignorance reigns supreme. The description of Surat's Ved Road is like something out of Dante's lowest circles or the Pharaoh's Egypt after God's plagues had done their worst. If you can imagine legions of bloated sewer rats letting loose billions of plague carrying fleas, you can begin to imagine Surat.<br /><br />Surat is not even the scariest place she describes. Although, for example, Mobutu and his ilk let loose the dogs of war, they also unleashed Africa's most lethal microbes as well. Mobutu's Zaire gave us several outbreaks of Ebola, which with lassa, yellow fever and Marburg disease ranks as among the most fatal diseases currently stalking Africa. Although Ebola has inspired Hollywood to make \\"Outbreak\\" and a few other B-grade movies that may be soon coming to a movie house near you, the trouble is that our globalized village means that Ebola and its killer cousins may also soon be coming to a slum town near you. Garrett tells us to beware of the coming deluge.<br /><br />For Russia, it may be too late. If Garrett is to be believed, Mother Russia's failure to provide healthcare for her children is on a par with Europe's Black Death of the fourteenth century. The collapse of the evil empire has unleashed epidemics of diphtheria, flu, typhoid, cholera, dysentery, TB, syphilis, gonorrhea and Aids. Alcoholism and drug abuse compound the situation. Radiation is also endemic - buildings made from waste products produced by Soviet nuclear facilities speckle the landscape of her major cities. Pollution, radiation, and malnutrition are gnawing away at the people's immune systems and Russians' life expectancy continues to fall as a result. Not even the epidemics of antiquity come close to the apocalypse now plaguing that blighted and thoroughly polluted land.<br /><br />Soviet surgeons, if Garrett is to be believed, never even learned to scrub their hands - even Groucho Marx knew that much. And even if they now know what to do, they can no longer be bothered. Russia's sanitation standards are now worse than Africa's. Because Russia's sewage pipes are mixed, almost as a matter of course, with water pipes, her tenements are breeding grounds for today's super bugs, which are resistant to all known forms of penicillin and its derivatives. As if all of that was not bad enough, Aids and TB - Ebola with wings, as Garrett describes it - is endemic in today's Russia. Russia's hospitals are so unhygienic that being a patient or a worker there is like playing Russian roulette - with a fully loaded chamber.<br /><br />Nor is that the end of it. Russia has 2 million IV drug users. Ten to 15 per cent of the Russian population has some experience with IV drug use. Welcome to Hell. And to a hitherto largely ignored major Aids epidemic. Mother Russia is at the forefront of the globalized sex industry and of the plagues of globalized sexually transmitted diseases, which are such an integral part of that booming industry. Not only are child prostitutes plying their trade directly in front of the Russian parliament but, with the rest of Russia's lost generation, they are literally giving the world a more virulent form of Aids. Russia more resembles Dante than Dostoyevsky.<br /><br />There is, in all of this, a great and urgent story to be told. Unfortunately, Garrett does not tell it. After informing us how tiny Estonia rescued itself from Russia's fate with the help of the Swedish Academy of Science, Garrett's book just goes downhill. She spends over 200 pages giving us a potted history of America's health care system from Christopher Columbus and Typhoid Mary up to Hilary Clinton and beyond. Then, for those of her readers who are determined to see the book through to the finish, she spends another 60 pages crying Wolf about biological warfare before giving us 70 pages of largely superfluous notes. Stephen King does not make those mistakes. He sticks to his plot and terrifies his readers. Garrett should have done the same. In trying to put several books under one cover, she trivializes the traumas of India, Africa and Russia and fails to scare us out of our complacency. So even though Bill Clinton and a clutch of Nobel Prize winners endorse the book's fly cover, a smaller book packing a more lethal punch would have served her purpose better.d a more virulent form of Aids.

Instead of discussing international trade issues, the participants looked on in horror as gangs of protesters wrecked the center of Seattle. Instead of sipping coffee in Starbuck's, they watched as the rioters gutted every Starbuck's outlet they could find.  For some reason that this weighty book does not fully explain, people who protest against the WTO seem to hate Starbuck's.<br /><br />The Institute for International Economics, which published this book, is probably above such venalities. Its Board of Directors includes some of the world's most influential figures including Conrad Black, Miguel de la Madrid, Nigel Lawson, Lee Kwan Yew, Paul O'Neill, David Rockefeller, Paul Krugman, George Schulz and even Alan Greenspan himself. Taken as a group, they certainly know their way around the corridors of power.<br /><br />That being so, it is a pity that they do not seem to be able to write well. The book is a rather turgid discussion of the issues that should have been aired at Seattle. Spokespeople for the United States, the European Union and the world's other major economic powers are each given a separate chapter to themselves. So too are such less than inspiring topics as intellectual property, anti-dumping legislation and electronic commerce. If nothing else, the book will suit economics professors looking for additional dull readings to inflict upon their unsuspecting students.<br /><br />Only two chapters enliven this otherwise comatose book. Surprisingly enough perhaps, the first of these is by Hisamitsu Arai from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). He begins by telling us that the Japanese delegation, like most others, had gone to Seattle with the best of intentions. The Japanese delegation, he tells us, went to Seattle, ready to debate the whole matrix of issues that are intertwined around international trade. The Japanese wanted to discuss not only the specific issues that concerned their American hosts but also the whole institutional and legal framework that continues to hold back international trade. MITI were intent on showing the United States some of the contradictions evident in their stance on a variety of issues. Whereas, for example, the United States objects to Japan and other countries dumping their products at below cost into the American market, Arai and his colleagues had evidence of 64 cases where the United States had dumped its own products into other market, Japan's included. MITI, whatever their faults may be, certainly do their homework.<br /><br />As well as bringing up America's ambivalent attitude to its own shortcomings, Arai's chapter also raises another issue. That issue is Canada. He speaks of the Quadrilateral Group of Japan, the United States, the European Union and Canada. What is Canada, a very minor economic power doing in that august group and several others such as G7? Why Canada? Why not India for example?<br /><br />Jayashree Watal, another contributor to this volume, would like to know. His contribution rails against the injustices mighty countries like his own India suffer from the great powers of Japan, the European Union and the United States as well as minnow powers like Canada. He sees the solution in putting development issues more to the center of future WTO debates.<br /><br />But therein lies the rub. It would be nice if India could have as many outlets of Starbuck's, the Body Shop, McDonald's and Kingburger as mighty countries like Japan and the United States have. However, before such a thing can come to pass, India's per capital income would have to approach the levels pertaining in the United States, Japan and Europe. Because that is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future, trade referees like the WTO, turgid commentators like the Institute for International Economics and unfortunate targets like Starbuck's will continue to flourish. There are some important lessons failures in economics can teach us. Indonesia's ethnic and sectarian strife is a case in point. The WTO, along with the World Bank and the IMF, have a case to answer there. It would be nice if those bodies and the rent-a-mob Starbuck's haters who follow their meetings around addressed themselves to finding fair and equitable solutions to the seemingly intractable problems that eventuate when economic and other forces cause countries like Indonesia to implode. Books like this one that concentrate too much on hitting the right diplomatic keys and on not alienating any of their key sponsors only prolong the problems of global inequity they purport to address.ll continue to flourish.

Michael Parenti. Verso Books. 246 pages. Yen 3,960.<br /><br />Review by Declan Hayes<br /><br />Operation Punishment was the most devastatingly swift of all Hitler's Blitzkriegs. Within ten days of its launch on 6 April 1941, and for the loss of only 166 men, the Germans overran Yugoslavia and moved on into Greece. Given its strategic irrelevance, they garrisoned it with a relatively small number of generally second-rate troops. The Nazi conquest of Yugoslavia was, therefore, by the times that prevailed, relatively bloodless. Not so the occupation, where Yugoslavia was primarily engulfed in a civil war. Of the 900,000 Yugoslavs who died in the War, the Axis forces probably killed less than ten per cent of them; the Germans and Italians were, in general, horrified by-standers.<br /><br />The Ustashi, Croatian fascists, probably murdered up to 350,000 Serbs, including 60,000 at Jasenovac, their most notorious camp. Mihailovic's Serbian Chetniks probably dispensed with an equal number of Croats. Tito's Communist partisans ran up a more modest but similarly impressive body-bag count. They instigated atrocities solely designed to reap the added recruits that the inevitable Axis retaliation would bring them. Having secured power, Tito ensured that the war's immediate aftermath was even bloodier than the German Occupation had been. After the Red Army raped their way into Belgrade and Berlin, a grateful Britain handed back almost a million Slovenes, Croats and White Russians, who had literally fled for their lives into British-occupied Austria, to Tito and Stalin. Some were shot, more were tossed into pits and dynamited. The rest were either returned to Stalin for slave work in Siberia or sent on death marches across liberated Yugoslavia.<br /><br />Today is merely a part of this historical continuum. Today is just the latest round in the ongoing mosaic of hatred we call the Balkans. Neither the terrain nor the cast of villains has substantially changed. Parenti's book is useful in that it points out how the Western powers, the United States and Germany in particular, colluded in the carve-up of Yugoslavia, that beautiful but blighted land of the Southern Slavs. The NATO forces are, of course, protecting their vital interests by removing Russia's buffer states from the political chessboard. That is nothing new or novel. Now that Mother Russia is laid low, the West wants to ensure that she and her key Serbian allies will never rise again.<br /><br />That is the general picture. The detail is, of course, as complex as only the Balkans can be. Parenti, just like the Western media he lambastes, glosses over that complexity or indeed the consequences that vital detail leads to in the foreign policy choices of the world's major powers.<br /><br />His analysis is a straightforward quasi-Marxist one. The brave and valiant Serbian socialists are being ethnically cleansed by the Croatian fascists and the Islamic warriors of Bosnia and Kosovo, all of whom are being bankrolled by the monopoly capitalists of the United States and the European Union, who are obsessed with destroying the Yugoslavian socialist utopia. Sure!<br /><br />Parenti is right to point to the complicity of outside powers. Germany's peremptory recognition of Slovenia and Croatia on 15 January 1992 which, till then, had been integral parts of sovereign Yugoslavia, though an astute act in realpolitik, made war imminent and inevitable. Recognition dissected a sovereign nation, it pitted Serbia against Croatia and turned Bosnia into a killing ground. However, even though the Germans and Austrians helped to light it, it was Josef Tito and the historical forces he inherited that built that huge pyre. That fire has not yet been extinguished and the embers will most likely be rekindled in the near future as Macedonia, Greece and Albania go on a collision course.<br /><br />What is to be done? Lenin spoke of exploiting the contradiction. Because politicians of all hues have done just that through the ages, the Balkans remain the byword in sectarian and racial violence that they are. The challenge has to be to resolve, rather than to exploit the contradiction, so that people could hope one day to live in peace, free from free and free from the shackles of history. For people to be free, the truth must be proclaimed. And Parenti has done just that.<br /><br />Although any Croatian, any Muslim or any Pentagon official could find holes galore in his thesis, Parenti's book is useful for a variety of important reasons. Despite its black-and-white quasi-Marxist approach, it is an attempt to show that the Serbs were among the prime victims of this latest round in the cycle of hatred we call the Balkans. So, of course, are the women being trafficked in today's liberated Bosnia and the victims of the endemic corruption that now reigns there. But, as history and this book both show us, peace in the Balkans is often no prettier than war.he contradiction.

By Nicholas Dunbar.  Wiley, 248 pages $29.95<br /><br />When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management. By Roger Lowenstein. Random House . 264 pages, $26.95<br /><br />Long Term Credit Management's demise is one of a number of recent high profile collapses involving the world's derivatives markets. Other recent ones include those of Sumitomo's chief copper trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, who lost $1.8 billion during a decade of unauthorized dealing and price manipulation in the copper market; Orange County's $1.7 billion loss on risky, highly leveraged investments on the direction of interest rates; Metallgesellschaft's $900 million loss on crude oil hedges; and, of course the activities of Nicholas Leeson, Baring's infamous Rogue Trader.<br /><br />All of these cases throw forward lessons I use in my Futures and Option classes at Sophia University. Important though they are, the main textbooks remain those written by such Nobel Prize winners as Robert Merton and Myron Scholes. The irony is that both of these geniuses were centrally involved in LTCM's demise. Despite their faux paus, their works remain seminal. They are brainy guys. Unfortunately, brains are not enough. Genius sometimes fails.<br /><br />LTCB was actually very short-term focused. Their assets consisted of a gigantic pile of extremely short-term pieces of paper leveraged to an unimaginable degree. They bought vast amounts of government paper and borrowed even greater amounts to pay for it. When Russia's markets collapsed in 1998, so did LTCM. The bank's complex mathematical bets on discrepancies in values amongst different bonds and derivatives came dramatically unstuck. Its US$7 billion capital base was eroded overnight. Most of LTCM's bets were in credit spreads, particularly European ones in the run-up to European monetary union. Essentially, LTCM held two different instruments - usually Italian, Greek or Danish bonds - and bet that the spread between the rates they offered and their German and American equivalents would narrow.<br /><br />When the Russian government defaulted on its debt, credit spreads in all markets widened suddenly and spectacularly as investors stampeded into the safest of safe havens. Investors fled Italian bonds, Brady bonds and every other relatively risky bond that LTCB depended on for sustenance. Borrowings had put LTCM's total exposure at more than US$100 billion, more than fourteen times its equity base. Most of this money had been sunk in derivatives. As its positions worsened, its daily margin calls bankrupted it. LTCB made the cardinal mistake of not cutting its losses. It threw good money after bad, believing that its fortunes would reverse. They didn't. Unable to meet margin calls, LTCB asked the US Federal Reserve Bank to bail it out. The Fed, afraid that LTCM's collapse might imperil the world's entire system, duly obliged.<br /><br />Because LTCB was comprised of Wall Street's best and brightest, there are lessons galore to be learned here for students and practitioners alike. Unfortunately, these two books do not do full justice to the lessons this case brings out. Lowenstein is a very successful American financial journalist and his book is by far the easier to read. He discusses the main characters involved in the debacle. Unfortunately for him, most of the main players have no real personalities to speak of at all. They are the so-called rocket scientists, the guys and gals with the quantitative expertise necessary to implement the complex strategies LTCM's Nobel Prize winners devised. To do them justice, one also needs a quantitative background. And because Lowenstein lacks this background, his book, though an enjoyable read, is peppered with potentially serious mistakes. And, in the world of derivatives, mistakes can be extremely costly.<br /><br />Dunbar has the quantitative background Lowenstein lacks. However, Dunbar wanders far from this. He discusses such irrelevant things as the role Chicago's grain markets played in America's civil war. He also spends more than half the book explaining how option pricing developed and the key role Scholes and Merton played in that process.

US	38872130	R35M30QVSELAX3	0765610744	699733767	Japanese Phoenix: The Long Road to Economic Revival	Books	1	7	7	N	N	old vinegar in a new bottle	Books on the Japanese economy should follow a reasonably simple format. Having first explained the conflicting objectives of Japan's policy makers, they should then outline the constraints the policy makers face in meeting those objectives and, finally, they should discuss the monetary and fiscal options available to Japan's policy makers in trying to reach their objectives.  That basic framework should serve as the scaffolding around which authors propound their various prognoses for the Japanese economy.<br /><br />Richard Katz, Senior Editor of The Oriental Economist Report, a monthly newsletter on Japan, takes a different approach in Japanese Phoenix: The Long Road to Economic Revival, his recently published book. Instead of approaching the Japanese economy in this systematic way, he seems to have merely gathered together several dozen of his articles from The Oriental Economist and collated them into a book. The result is a very uneven, disjointed and disappointing work that has little of substance to offer the reader.<br /><br />His rosary of disjointed articles put too much weight on the reforming zeal of recent prime ministers such as Junichiro Koizumi and the late Keizo Obuchi. He believes that Koizumi, like some hero in a manga comic, can single handedly turn the economy around and restore Japan's former growth rates. The reality is much more prosaic. Because Koizumi, like so many of his predecessors, is a prisoner of the outmoded structure of the Japanese economy, he is no more likely to effect fundamental change than they were.<br /><br />The Japanese economy is geared to exporting cars, video games, precision instruments and other high valued added products and using the trade surpluses those exports garner to pay both for its imports and to subsidize its very large sheltered sector: the farmers, distributors, construction workers and other inefficient sections of the Japanese workforce. Although Katz believes that these ailing sectors will become internationally competitive, he does not offer any compelling reasons or arguments to support his radical belief. Japan has gone from being a country with excess pools of labor to being a nation where young workers are at a premium. That being so, Japan must concentrate on high value added industries whilst also being cognizant of the considerable financial problems its graying demographics portend. Japan therefore runs the risks of concentrating on too narrow a range of exports and prematurely relaxing its immigration policies to make up its labor shortfall. Although these problems are easy to propound, they are not so easy to solve. New international markets are not easily won and a major influx of immigrants would lead to radical social upheavals, at least in the short term. Japan's political leaders, wisely enough perhaps, given the political constraints they labor under, prefer to postpone the inevitable day of reckoning.<br /><br />The Japanese problem is, in many ways, analogous to India's. Though we may criticize India's caste system, yet we cannot propound any way of effecting change without incurring very major short term upheavals. Japan's leader know very well what Japan's economic problems are: their dilemma lies in redressing them, not in identifying them and Katz certainly does not provide them with any useful policy insights.<br /><br />Contrary to what Katz may believe, Japan's problems will not be solved by whatever edicts Koizumi might pass. Rather, they will be solved by Japan's business community working in consort with the government and gradually achieving the necessary structural reforms.<br /><br />Because monetary policy will undoubtedly play a part in this just as it has in stimulating demand in America during the 1990s, Katz is therefore wrong to berate those who favor monetary action as a partial palliative for Japan's ills.  He is also wrong to castigate the so-called revisionists, those who argue that the Japanese economic model is radically different from Western models. The reality is that every country is different from the standard text book model: the German growth model, for example, is markedly different from the British and Dutch models, which in turn have very little in common with the rent seeking Spanish type. American capitalism is very different again, simply because the United States faced a different matrix of objectives and constraints that did any of those European countries. Japan, which depends so much on exports to fund its huge protected area, marches to yet a different drum. Contrary to what Katz believes, Japan's problems are not \\"eminently solvable\\". They are as deep, as entrenched and as resistant to change as are those of India, the United States, Germany or any other country. Although Japan's political and business leaders will, in time, find partial solutions to Japan's economic woes, those solutions will not be found within the pages of this badly edited book.is radically different from Western models.

Ri&eacute;s was AFP's Tokyo correspondent and Starr was his equivalent in Kuala Lumpur. Although the journalistic sources are clearly evident from beginning to end, they shine through most clearly in tiny vignettes, which speckle every chapter of the tome. One of these has Britain's Prince Charles sailing out of Hong Kong on the royal yacht Brittania with the Union Jack in tow, signifying the end of empire. As Prince Charles, the Brittania and the story of Hong Kong's hand over faded away from view, Ri&eacute;s and his AFP colleagues had other things to worry about. Chief of these was the gathering storms of the Asian financial crisis. The image of Ri&eacute;s, then stationed in Hong Kong, frantically phoning up the worldwide sources that journalists depend on to cover a global story such as this, jumps from the pages. Because of the international dimension of the Asian storm, the phones must have been very busy indeed.<br /><br />Ri&eacute;s captures this international angle to an uncanny degree. As well as recounting the importance of the Japanese yen and American dollar to fueling the crisis, he describes much of the human effects of the crash as well. We hear of life savings lost and, less tragically perhaps, of top Thai stockbrokers reduced to selling sandwiches to make ends meet. More interestingly from an academic viewpoint, he has a go at some of the world's major Asian experts, MIT's Paul Krugman being a case in point.<br /><br />Krugman is, of course, a prolific writer and it is interesting to see a journalist's take on his more weird pronouncements. Krugman, for example, compares Singapore to Stalin's Soviet Union and says that the Singaporean model for economic growth is as flawed as Stalin's was. Ri&eacute;s' informative book is to be applauded for bringing bizarre statements like that to our attention. Whatever the faults of Singapore might be, they are in no way comparable to Stalin's gulag. Most people, if given the chance, would have fled Stalin's evil empire. Most Asians, if given the opportunity, would gladly work in Singapore.<br /><br />That is certainly the case for the citizens of nearby Indonesia, who remain at the center of the Asian storm. Interestingly enough in this respect, Michel Camdessus, the managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, lavishes praise on the book in the dust jacket. Although the praise is warranted, the source of that praise has to be questioned. Indonesia was the IMF's star pupil. Because the IMF ignored - and, many argue, actually financially underwrote - the blatant corruption Suharto epitomized, the praise, though welcome, leads to at least one pertinent question. What is the IMF doing to stem the sectarian pogroms the Asian storm and the IMF's policies helped to spark?<br /><br />Indonesia represents the dark but all too real side of the Asian crisis. And there is no guarantee that the bloodshed will be confined to Indonesia. Ri&eacute;s also gives the more xenophobic pronouncements of Malaysia's charismatic leader, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, due prominence. Mahathir is in the process of nation building, of trying to make Malaysia an economic force. This is undoubtedly a difficult job, made harder by the loss of confidence the Asian crisis provoked. Growing sectarian restlessness in Malaysia, Indonesia and the southern islands of the Philippines do not portend well for the region's future. The storm, as Mahathir well knows, is not over yet.<br /><br />As long as Asia lacks a regional financial anchor, this instability and concomitant bloodshed will remain and most likely spread beyond Indonesia. Although the obvious choice for such a stabilizing anchor is Japan, there are, as the author points out, major problems with Japan playing a similar role in Asia that Germany, the Netherlands and similar countries play in Europe. In Asia, the economic disparities between Japan and the other Asian tigers is just too immense to be bridged in the near future. Although the book describes the very real financial and economic pain Japan's citizens experienced as a result of the Japanese bubble bursting, this is nothing to what people in Thailand, South Korea and most especially Indonesia have gone through over the same period. Although this is small consolation to the victims of Japan's crash, there is a glimmer of hope in all of this. The policies of the IMF stand discredited, and the pronouncements of experts like Krugman have similarly fallen into disrepute. A new paradigm, to use the clich&eacute;, is needed. For this to eventuate, fresh voices must be heard. The words and the methodologies of Philippe Ri&eacute;s and his AFP colleagues are part of that process. Unless Asia's leaders heed their words, the imperfect storm Ri&eacute;s describes will be replaced by a veritable inferno.e other Asian tigers is just too immense to be bridged in the near future.

By the late 1990s, Nissan had lost its focus and direction. Whereas Honda and Toyota were both going from strength to strength, Nissan languished, its glory days seemingly gone forever. Faced with a mountain of debt, they allowed the French Renault company to buy what was effectively a controlling stake in the company.<br /><br />Renault dispatched Ghosn to Tokyo, where Ghosn performed what can only be described as miracles. He slashed Nissan's debt burden, he restored its cost competitiveness, he sold off non performing assets, he reorganized its finances and streamlined its management systems. Magee tells us that he even inspired the F-Marinos, the soccer team Nissan sponsor, to advance from languishing in 13th place in its league division to winning the competition, all in the space of a year.<br /><br />How could one relatively young man accomplish so much in such a short period of time? Magee attributes his massive successes to the homespun wisdom of Fr. Lagrovole, a Jesuit priest, who taught Ghosn at school in Lebanon! Lagrovole advised his young charge to listen before he speaks and to understand where everyone is coming from in cultural and other terms.<br /><br />Armed with this advice, Ghosn set out to take to the corporate world by storm. Before reviving Nissan's fortunes, he restored Michelin's profitability in its key Brazilian market.  Having then organized the merger of Uniroyal -Goodrich and Michelin, he was head hunted by Renault and quickly revived their fortunes in Europe. Having solved their European problems, Ghosn was dispatched to Tokyo to reinvigorate the newly acquired Nissan company.<br /><br />Ghosn, in some ways, comes across as a comic book hero. And in fact, he was made the hero of a Japanese manga comic book, which he helped write and which Japanese salary men eagerly read in the hope of picking up some managerial tips from this remarkable man.<br /><br />Fr. Lagrovole's advice apart, they will find few tips in this book which tells us that Ghosn's forte seems to be at cross-cultural management and at paying attention to both the minutest detail and overall strategy.  There are no worthwhile insights into the mind of this remarkable strategist. We hear, unsurprisingly, given his results, that he works very hard but likes to devote his weekends to his family but we get no inclination of why he is so brilliant and how we lesser mortals can learn from his successes and his failures, assuming, if we dare, that he has ever failed at anything.<br /><br />We are told that the Nissan revival has been a great success. But, as with his earlier successes, the synergies to Renault are not explained. We are not even told what Renault hoped to gain by taking over Nissan. Instead, we are told on pages 207/8 that \\"Ghosn stressed time and time again that he and others were at Nissan for the good of Nissan, not for the good of Renault.\\"<br /><br />But it does not make sense that Renault should take over Nissan so that Nissan would benefit. Renault's management is supposed to work in the interests of Renault's shareholders, not Nissan's. We are told that Renault hopes the Nissan merger will boost Renault's sales in Indonesia. But, just as we are not told why Renault failed to merge with Volvo, so also are we not told why an unstable country like Indonesia stands at the center of Renault's projected synergy gains.<br /><br />Instead, Magee informs us that Nissan has gained so much from the Renault alliance that it might soon be strong enough to divorce itself from the French company entirely. If so, how did Ghosn's successes with Nissan benefit Renault and, Indonesia apart, has the Nissan merger strengthened Renault's position in the auto market against the formidable opposition of such titans as Toyota, Honda, Ford, General Motors, Daimler and Volkswagen?<br /><br />Instead of addressing those key managerial and strategic questions, Magee wastes too much time discussing such things as Mississippi's race riots in the 1960s. The result is a shallow book that does not do justice to the very important topics it purports to cover.he Nissan merger strengthened Renault's position in the auto market against the formidable opposition of such titans as Toyota, Honda, Ford, General Motors, Daimler and Volkswagen?  <br />Instead of addressing those key managerial and strategic questions, Magee wastes too much time discussing such things as Mississippi's race riots in the 1960s.

Apollo, the sun god, transformed a youth he coveted into a hyacinth after Zephyr, the god of the west wind, killed him. The Incas worshipped the sunflower as a symbol of their sun god.<br /><br />Russell's fine book explains not only how all cultures and peoples have elevated flowers to the realm of the spiritual but also how flowers survived the rampaging dinosaurs and provided our earliest ancestors with their basic physical and spiritual needs: our Neanderthal ancestors buried their dead with blue hyacinth, yellow groundsel, knapweed and yarrow. Even then, we were looking for beauty and something higher than ourselves.<br /><br />Russell shows us how the physics of beauty allows flowers to serve nature's needs in ways much more miraculous than the more mundane ones of Moses parting the Red Sea or the Greek legend of the North Wind fertilizing wild mares. Such manifestations of the divine are, the author explains, commonplace in the temporal world of flowers.<br /><br />Russell, for example, shows how flowers are literally the fruit of life. Their pollen is 16-30 percent protein, 1-10 percent fat, and 1-7 percent starch. Because pollen has no sugar and contains a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, bees are on to a very good thing. So too are the flowers because the bees and similar insects spread their seeds far and wide. The same applies to such unattractive specimens as the skunk cabbage, the corpse flower and the stinking goosefoot. Russell's clear prose paints out their survival strategies as eloquently as he does those of other, more beguiling flowers.<br /><br />Although the fable of the flowers and the bees is the most well known one of mutual dependence and coevolution in nature, Russell lists a breath taking variety of other ones, such as the yucca and yucca moth, which are so perfectly attuned to each other that they remind us of mating swans.<br /><br />However, as a first rate writer like Russell knows, no good love story is complete without a crown of thorns. Because so many animals like to eat entire plants and not just suck their nectar or collect their pollen, the flowers have to develop effective defense shields. Typical of these is the way the fungus gnat is lured into a trap by flowers that mimic fungi. When the unfortunate gnat leaves the flower covered in pollen, the eggs are left behind to die of eventual starvation. This means there will be fewer gnats in the future to harass the \\"defenseless\\" flowers. That is not the only trick the flowers have up their collective sleeves. They use one animal variety to protect them from another variety and then they develop special chemicals to protect themselves against their protectors. And they are past masters of chemical warfare.<br /><br />Russell's highly recommended book gives countless other examples of the fox being outfoxed. The water lily, for example, offers a banquet Roman in scope and delight to a wide variety of bees, hoverflies and beetles. Then, like the most treacherous lover, it tricks them into serving its own selfish own needs. The water lily is only one of the many examples of particularly strong iron fists being enveloped in very alluring velvet gloves that the author gives.<br /><br />Perhaps we too, who are so foxy with nature, might end up in a trap of our own making. After regaling us with a lavish banquet that even the water lily might envy, Russell explains that there will be more environmental changes in this century than at any time since the dinosaurs became extinct tens of millions of years ago. Although we might cause the symphony of life and evolution to end sooner rather than later, Russell's fine book makes the point that flowers are probably more adapted for what lies ahead than we are.

In front of a capacity crowd of 10,000 men and children, they took Abdullah Afghan out onto the pitch, placed him between the goalposts and riddled him full of lead. The Taliban don't fool around. Nor do they suffer fools gladly.<br /><br />Or graven images for that matter. Page 68 of this fantastic book explains precisely why the Taliban's destruction of the giant Buddha statues in Afghanistan's central Bamiyan province were such a monumental loss for all of humanity, Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike. The book's description of how the Hazaras, who live in the Hindu Kush Mountains of Bamiyan, were starved into submitting to the will of the Taliban helps explain why we can expect to hear much more from these modern crusaders. The Hazaras, like their Iranian allies, are Shia Muslims. And the Taliban don't like Shias, whom they regard as incorrigible heretics, who must be given the choice of converting to the Sunni faith or death. Because the Taliban see the world in such stark and simple binary choices, they and their Pakisani allies are on a collision course with India, Russia and China. They are increasingly becoming pivotal players in an unholy war that will most likely engulf all of central Asia.<br /><br />As well as having the world's most extreme political leaders, they also have the world's most disabled. Mullah Mohammad Hassan Rehmani has a wooden peg leg, in the style of Treasure Island's Long John Silver. Most other Taliban leaders, including Mullah Mohammed Omar, their supreme commander, are missing either a leg or an eye. Like the chorus in the Pirates of Penzance, such wounds are all too common in their ranks. Although this is unsurprising in a land where 1.5 million people have been killed in the battles of recent years, their war wounds give them street credibility in places like Palestine, which is witnessing massive demonstrations calling for more suicide bombers against Israel. No doubt Osama bin Laden and his Taliban hosts see the Palestinians as part of a bigger picture, whose end objective is to unify all of Islam's protesting streams into one great torrent.<br /><br />The Taliban are certainly helping this tidal wave gather momentum and critical mass. As well as playing willing host to Mr. bin Laden and his troops, they are also supplying the Chechens and other Islamic fighters in the former Soviet Union with their materiel and, in the process, sending a chill up the collective spine of the world's leaders.  However, Afghanistan is no rest and recreation stop-off for bin Laden and his men. This is because, public executions aside, there is no such thing as rest and recreation in the Taliban's Afghanistan. Even chess is banned. The men must pray and fight, the young boys must learn to pray and fight. And the women?<br /><br />In Afghanistan, a woman's lot is definitely not a happy one. Their job, if they want to stay alive, is to stay pregnant and stay in the kitchen. The Taliban need new blood, new male babies and, of course, very plain and wholesome food. Woe betide any woman who thinks differently! The Taliban's actions have already shown Afghanistan's women the fatal consequences of deviating from the will of Allah, as interpreted by Mullah Omar. Women in Afghanistan are treated worse than field animals are. They, God help them, are part of the Taliban's great design.  That design, as interpreted by Mullah Omar, involves much more than the destruction of Afghanistan's rich history. As well as banning all forms of entertainment except public execution, skinning prisoners alive, roasting unbelievers to death, forbidding women to even get - or see  - fresh air, it is creating a world where there is nothing to do except to fight and die for one's beliefs. Surely this man made hell cannot be what the Prophet wanted.<br /><br />As well as positing how the Taliban damage Islam, Rashdid shows whom the true beneficiaries of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden are. No doubt this is what the ancients, who sang so lovingly of Afghanistan's rich cultural tapestry, meant when they warned us to beware of Greeks - or Pakistani generals - bearing gifts and causing mayhem.<br /><br />Postscript: It is amazing that such a band of backward looking reractionaries can command such support. The tribesmen who shelter Osama and friends have it within their power to cede from Pakistan and unravel that axis of evil. Then the stuff wil really hit the fan. One wonders can we defeat or emasculate these brigands and what will replace them to give our leaders sleepless nightsn damage Islam, Rashdid shows whom the true beneficiaries of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden are.

Zachary, a senior writer for the Wall Street Journal, propounds the thesis that a new cosmopolitan figure is emerging on the world stage. This figure is equally at home in Japan or Ireland and is unencumbered by the prejudices of the past. This a new kind of Superman, who treats the world as his oyster and is as happy eating oysters as he is drinking pints of Guinness or bottles of sake. He is the true cosmopolitan and tomorrow, if Zachary is to be believed, belongs to him.<br /><br />To make the same argument on a global scale, he introduces us to a host of globalized characters. We meet Barry Cox, an English kid from Liverpool who sings pop songs in perfect Cantonese; Vince Morabito, a nomadic farm expert who is equally at home in the wheat fields of Nebraska, the vineyards of Moldova or the rice paddies of Southeast Asia; Soo Ing, the German-educated, Canadian-born daughter of Chinese immigrants, who ranges the Mongolian plains on horseback studying the uses and abuses of fire. These super human characters all seem to be modeled on Indiana Jones, Laurence of Arabia or other such folk heroes. They certainly seem to travel a lot.<br /><br />Micklethwait and Wooldridge, who both write for the Economist magazine, pursue a broadly similar path and also introduce us to an array of cosmocrats who are spearheading this revolution from one end of the world to the other. The authors introduce us to a range of people who are exporting Southern California's pornography to the four corners of the earth. We meet traditional Moroccan perfume sellers who export their fragrances to the entire world. We also meet Zambian-born economists, German and Japanese auto workers, Singaporean math teachers, Indian entrepreneurs and a galaxy of other characters drawn from just about every nation in the world showing us the benefits of this globalized age. Although the authors also show us some of the downsides, the overall message is clear. Globalization is the way of the future.<br /><br />Despite articulate prophets like these, that future will be a long time in coming even in export-oriented countries like Japan and Ireland, which remain prisoners to the fortunes of the international economy. Countries and nations will continue to nurture their different cultures and opposition to the pronouncements of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other messiahs of globalization will remain as perennial as the economic insecurity globalization has visited upon most of the world's communities.<br /><br />People, in other words, will still strive for meaning and a sense of belonging in today's global village. This need to belong will ensure that conflict will remain as perennial as attempts like these two books to reduce all of our desires and experiences to a simple cocktail of clich&eacute;s. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, belief in Marxism waned. Many of Marxism's apostates have now embraced this new credo. Unfortunately, it explains as little as did the writings of the cosmopolitan Karl Marx, who is used as a straw man in the last chapter of the book by Micklethwait and Wooldridge. Ultimately, theories like globalization, which purport to explain everything, explain absolutely nothing. The same goes for these two books. Although they give us a nice overview of what the authors do with their time, they leave us none the wiser at the end.  Worse still, by marginalizing the very real social and economic problems globalization begets, they help to guarantee that they will continue to fester in the years to come. Individuals like Osama bin Laden, who think globally and act locally, will see to that. There is, in other words, nothing new, noteworthy or novel beneath the covers of these and similar eminently readable but ultimately disappointing books.enefits of this globalized age.

Ultimately, theories like globalization, which purport to explain everything, explain absolutely nothing. The same goes for these two books. Although they give us a nice overview of what the authors do with their time, they leave us none the wiser at the end.  Worse still, by marginalizing the very real social and economic problems globalization begets, they help to guarantee that they will continue to fester in the years to come. Individuals like Osama bin Laden, who think globally and act locally, will see to that. There is, in other words, nothing new, noteworthy or novel beneath the covers of these and similar eminently readable but ultimately disappointing books.	2005-10-01
US	38872130	R3A1MM9UNF4PH5	076561006X	429066194	Bamboozled!: How America Loses the Intellectual Game with Japan and Its Implications for Our Future in Asia	Books	5	4	5	N	N	for reasons I later explain	Ivan Hall's latest book should prove to be controversial for a number of important reasons, chief of which is his contention that Japan continues to outwit and outflank the United States on trade and other important economic matters. He further contends that Japanese society is constructed in such a manner that voices of dissent are stifled, that a large number of American academics, journalists and diplomats have been either bought, bought, beguiled or bamboozled by their Japanese counterparts into being proponents of Japanese neo-mercantilist policies.  Hall is clearly not among that number.<br /><br />Instead of accepting the prevailing orthodoxy that Japan is suffering from a prolonged recession, Hall believes that the Japanese economy is as buoyant as it ever was. Although he cites countless examples to show where Japanese industry continues to outpace her rivals, his main points are that a large coterie of journalists, academics and other commentators are deceived by Japanese spin doctors into believing that Japan is economically weak and that those deceived commentators assist Japan in continuing to accumulate vast trade surpluses with almost every other country in the world.<br /><br />Although he is right to dismiss those who are beguiled by tea ceremonies, geisha girls and the other accoutrements of Japan's \\"soft diplomacy\\", he appears not to give some underlying socioeconomic imperatives their due weight. Prior to Perry's Black Ships, Japan was not invaded, solely because she was too strong to be invaded. When Perry forced the Japanese to engage with the world, the Japanese proved to be excellent students. When Japan's armies marched in to Korea, China and other countries to build, at bayonet point, markets for Japanese goods, the Japanese were merely copying the prevailing imperialist orthodoxies of the Dutch, British and Americans. Hall's book would have been considerably enhanced by acknowledging that Japanese imperialism was, in essence, no different from the prevailing European or American varieties.<br /><br />When Japanese mercantilism ended in 1945, the Americans forged Japanese economic policies to serve America's own ends. The emergence of Communist China and the Korean war reinforced Japan's new, American inspired neo-mercantilist role: sheltering under the Pax Americana, Japan now exported its transistor radios and Honda motor bikes to the four corners of the globe. Japan is still doing that. Because the United States is the world's most important market, much of Japan's exports go to the United States and Japan, quite naturally, expends quite a lot of resources in \\"soft diplomacy\\" guaranteeing and solidifying those markets. The Japanese endow American universities and wine and dine journalists so that they will not bite the Japanese hand that gives them succor.  Although Hall makes the important point that no other country does this to the same degree, Japan is the world's second largest economy: no other country could, in other words, afford to do so. And, of course, no other major country is as dependent<br />on export markets as Japan is.<br /><br />If the old Japanese cliche that the nail that sticks up gets hammered down has any validity, Japanese society must be structured to marginalize dissent. This must prove particularly irksome for people like Ivan Hall, who so passionately espouse the key American principle of unfettered free speech. Hall is to be applauded for pointing out where Westerners have belittled, if not betrayed, that principle when dealing with Japan. He is also to be applauded for bringing attention to some of the less savory players in modern Japanese political life.<br /><br />In showing how some key American commentators have sold their souls for a mess of Japanese pottage, Hall's book is to be welcomed as, in the long run, such invidious intellectual prostitution does not serve the interests of either country.<br /><br />Postscript: When I invited Hall to speak to my studentson this subject, a small coterie of my colleagues conspired to stop him speaking and branded him an anti American racist. An odd occurrence as The Tokyo American Chamber of Commerce threw their doors open to Hall, an American veteran. Hall's persecution merely proved his point: that a small band of pampered American under achievers do not want open or informed debate on Japan or anything else for that matter. I explore this issue in chapter 6 of my new book and tie it into the nutty censorship that is prevalent in America where academics like Ward Churchill can say the oddest, the most uninformed and the most needlessly hurtful of things. Hall's earlier book, Cartels of the Mind, also came in for intense criticism by the \\"usual suspects\\". But a moment's thought would show his basic hypothesis has substance: Japan, the land of cartels, should obviously be partial to cartels of the mind. Or cartels of the mindless if we include Hall's cowardly critics. When I invited Hall to speak, I remarked to an \\"old friend of Hall's\\" (very much a fairweather one as it happened), that I was in the spirit of Voltaire: not necessarily agreeing with Hall but defending his right to speak (just as the American Chamber of Commerce did). Others take a different tack and they oppose freedon of speech or informed debate because it threatens their pampered existence. Bamboozled is worth reading as, like Cartels, it extends the \\"Closing of the Mind\\" thesis done by these intellectual harlots from the US to Japan. Hall did a PhD on Japan at Harvard and those who sat in the same class as him do not want his voice heard or his points raised. That should be reason enough to see for yourself what it is they are so afraid of.onspired to stop him speaking and branded him an anti American racist.

One of these has Soviet troops raising the Red Flag atop the remnants of Hitler's Reichstag. The other, the inspiration for this book, sees the victorious United States Marine Corps (USMC) hoisting the Stars and Stripes over the Pacific island of Iwo Jima after 31 days of the fiercest hand to hand fighting of the entire war. One of those young Americans was John Bradley. His son, James, wrote this book in tribute to him, to the five others who hoisted Old Glory along with him on the flank of Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi and to their thousands of comrades who perished capturing that volcanic rock. The author, in jumping on the Greatest Generation bandwagon, spends too much time praising \\"our boys\\" and not enough time or efffort describing what actually happened and how the dogged and singularly professional defense of the Japanese Imperial troops on Iwo Jima shaped the subsequnet Okinawa campaign.<br /><br />The Iwo Jima amphibious assault was the ultimate \\"storm landing\\", the Japanese phrase describing the American propensity for concentrating overwhelming force at the main point of attack. Vice Admiral Raymond A. Spruance's Fifth Fleet enjoyed total domination of the sky and sea around the tiny, sulfuric island, and the 75,000 Marines in the landing force outnumbered the defending garrison by a healthy 3-to-1 margin. The operation was going to be a cakewalk.<br /><br />The Japanese had other ideas. Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi's garrison defended the island in depth - from hidden interior positions, not at the water's edge - and he also eschewed the massive, suicidal banzai attacks used by his predecessors in the Gilberts, Marshalls and Marianas. As a result, Iwo Jima was the only major battle in the Pacific War in which the USMC suffered greater casualties than they inflicted on the Japanese defenders. The Marines took 24,053 casualties, including over 6,000 fatalities, almost 30% of the total American forces employed. Some American units suffered 100% casualties; three of the six who raised the flag were killed on Iwo Jima. The Japanese suffered almost 100% fatalities.<br /><br />Kuribayashi honeycombed the island with 13,000 yards of tunnels and a further 5,000 cave entrances and pillboxes. Concrete blockhouses with 5-foot thick walls served as gun emplacements. This made the defenses practically immune to the effects of American artillery, which more often than not served the sole purpose of alerting the Japanese that a fresh assault was imminent. The positioning of the defenses were well thought out, allowing fire from multiple well-hidden locations to rain down on the most logical paths of advance.<br /><br />American daily gains were often measured in feet and yards. Japanese units would wait until the Americans advanced past them; then they would emerge from their bunkers and mow them down from a dozen different directions with mortars and small arms. In the hand to hand combat that typified Iwo Jima, the Americans deployed bazookas, flame-throwers, grenades and Sherman tanks, all fired at point blank range. The Japanese responded with enormous 320mm spigot mortars that fired the biggest shells the Marines had ever seen. Kuribayashi also used aerial bombs lofted from crude rocket launchers. These were each the size of a 55-gallon drum and terrified the Marines - who fought on regardless.<br /><br />This book commemorates the American heroes of that carnage - both those who survived and those who did not. It gives a brief overview of the six who raised the flag - Bradley's father was accompanied by a Pennsylvania steel-mill worker, an Arizona Indian, a Kentucky hillbilly, and two other ordinary men war made achieve extraordinary feats of valor. Thus valor is epitomized in the famous flag-raising episode which dons the book's front cover and now marks the Marines' monument at Arlington Cemetery.<br /><br />Flags, not least because of the spilled blood and shattered hopes they typify, are potent symbols. When, for example, the Japanese flagship Hiryu was sunk during the Midway Battle, the ship's doomed buglers played the national anthem, the Kimigayo, Admiral Yamaguchi and Captain Kaku lined up their men, who proudly saluted their Rising Sun flag as they went to their watery graves. Although Midway, like Iwo Jima, had major national significance, it had much more personal significance for the parents, widows and orphans left behind. Books like Flags of our Fathers just point to the ultimate futility and blasphemy of all wars.<br /><br />Although the flags of all our fathers deserve respect, the challenge must be to permanently decommission them, along with the blasphemy of war they ultimately represent. Notwithstanding the almost super-human bravery displayed by both sides in that grisly conflict, Iwo Jima has become a byword for the barbarity of war. Old soldiers, they say, never die. Young ones certainly do in places like Iwo Jima. And, though the old survivors should be venerated in well-written books like this, the ultimate aim should be to demystify and deglorify all such acts so that young soldiers might also not die. That, however, is the work of other authors. This one has done his job well.<br />(...)ot least because of the spilled blood and shattered hopes they typify, are potent symbols.

US	38872130	R25OYU47ZQP22S	1596870869	400656986	Samurai!	Books	5	22	25	N	N	the old school	Samurai! documents the wartime exploits of Saburo Sakai, the greatest Japanese fighter pilot to survive World War 11, in which he was credited with downing 64 enemy aircraft. Sakai, who died in September 2000 of a heart attack became a legend in his own lifetime. This book explains why.<br /><br />Samurai! takes us from early victories over the Chinese airforce to the later dogfights with the Dutch, the Australians and, finally, the unstoppable Americans. Sakai, in describing his journey from a rookie pilot to the final surrender, also chronicles the rise and fall of the Japanese Imperial Naval Air Force as seen from one of the most spectacular cogs in its vast apparatus.<br /><br />Saka, who was never decorated for his actions, was a truly amazing fighter who was held in adulation by his mechanics and wingmen. Indeed, of all Japan's aces, Saburo Sakai was the only one who never lost a wingman in combat. This is an astounding record for a man who engaged in over two hundred aerial melees. But then again, Saburo Sakai's story is an astounding one.<br /><br />His retreat from Guadalcanal is evidence enough of that. Having suffered paralyzing wounds in his left leg and left arm and having being permanently blinded in his left eye and temporarily blinded in his right eye, with jagged pieces of metal in his back and chest and with the heavy fragments of two 5-caliber machinegun bullets imbedded in his skull, he managed to fly his crippled Zero all the way back to New Guinea. That is the stuff of Hollywood legends.<br /><br />So too is his dogfight against 15 Hellcats over Iwo Jima. Although he only had sight in one eye, Sakai managed to out manouver the Hellcat fighters and land safely back on the besieged island. His escape from Iwo Jima is also the stuff of Hollywood legends.<br /><br />Hollywood bases its stories on legendary warriors. And Sakai and his comrades quickly became legends as their honed skills and Mitsubishi Zeros allowed them to cut a swathe through their Chinese, Dutch and Australian enemies. Sakai's accounts of those earlier battles are like reading th accounts of Cochise, Crazy Horse or Geronimo. Sakai and the other Japanese warriors of the air went out and did what they felt they had to do. Their Zeros were as precious to them as the finest steeds were to the warriors of old. They were the cream of the crop.<br /><br />Unfortunately for them, their numbers were whittled down as the war dragged on. Midway accounted for over 300 of Japan's best pilots.The Americans, meanwhile, came relentlessly at them with their Wildcat and Hellcat fighters, which were purposely designed to outpace the Zero. Time and again, Sakai stresses that it was only the Americans' lack of combat experience that saved him.<br /><br />They didn't save the others. As the war dragged on, the standard of the average Japanese pilot plummeted.<br /><br />This book is not a glorification If this book glorifies anything, it is the futility and blaspehemy of war. Sakai describes how business went on as usuall in China even in the middle of combat zones. He describes watching Australian pilots being eaten by sharks. His account of how his superior skills saved him at Iwo Jima reflect the skills he noted in the Dutch and Chinese pilots of the earlier chapters. The Japanese, who had been the confident hunters I nthe earlier chapters, were now the prey. Usually, they were sitting ducks, powerless to do anything but volunteer for a kamikaze mission or to train the young novices who made the bult of the kamikazes.<br /><br />Hiroyoshi Nishizawa, another top air ace who was later shot out of the air in an unarmed transport plane, was one of these. Sakai describes him as bing \\"unpredictable in the air, a genius, a poet who seemed to make his fighter respond obediently to his gentle, sure touch at the controls.\\" Sakai constantly uses similar imagery to decribe his love for the Zero. This book has been reissued on countless occasions. Read it and find out why.	2005-10-01
US	38872130	R31D8FVBM9OQRV	080482116X	370846993	New China	Books	3	0	0	N	N	chinese dreams and memories	Although China's vast population makes it almost impossible to encapsulate their experiences within one tome, Massonnet makes a brave attempt. He uses the fate of four Chinese citizens and their friends and families to infuse the vibrancy of modern China, warts and all, into his pages. In modern China, money is king, lord and master of all and the author, through his four John Does, paints an image of a nation obsessed with it. In modern China, economic progress and human misery are being achieved on scales unprecedented in human history.<br /><br />Scale is usually what defeats most books on modern China. And Massonnet captures that scale - and the human poignancy beneath it. Tens of millions of peasants are deserting the villages and trekking to Beijing, Shanghai and the other modern Klondykes of the People's Republic. The trains, buses and roads teem with these ordinary Chinese people flocking into the cities in search of money, China's new god. Instead of the crock of gold, most of them are finding misery on scales they could never have imagined possible.<br /><br />The author deftly paints in the human misery of these unsung masses. He tells of peasant girls forced into prostitution almost as a matter of course, of unskilled laborers defrauded of their wages, of the petty corruption practices of the police and party officials, of the sheer struggle of most Chinese people just to eke out a subsistence living. He tells of hospitals where infant mortality rates exceed 70%, and, bizarre as it seems, where the only piece of modern equipment is a karaoke machine. He tells us that China has 180 million illiterates, that its educational system totters on the verge of collapse and that elite private schools are growing to cater to those who have struck it rich. It is a country in flux.<br /><br />And the poor are being overwhelmed by the swell. Because they are poor, they are forced to drown their sorrows in fake whiskies and seek solace for their ailments in fake medicines. In a land where even the most primitive health care is a luxury, they pay a terrible price for this. Just as the alcohol often makes them go blind, so also do the quack medicines destroy their health in the new, uncaring China. These tens of millions of ordinary victims are the pebble stones along the road to making China a world economic power.<br /><br />Times are changing. The few barefoot movie projectionists of Mao's cultural revolution, who remain loyal to the Party, are churning out politically correct cartoons, which explain the Party's glorious past to China's children. The kids despise these shows and watch imported apolitical Japanese cartoons instead. These children, even more so than their elders, are caught up in the consumption craze sweeping the country. They are, in fact, often conspicuous consumption personified. Because their cash rich parents and grandparents pamper them, they are often obese to a worrying degree.<br /><br />Not that their Communist Party leaders worry about such minor things. Their chief concern is to protect their political turf - and the kudos it brings. To protect their ideological monopoly, they harass those who seek an opiate from life's daily grind in religion. The Party's harassment of all forms of ideological dissent is the main cancer that gnaws at modern Chinese society. The masses have now thrown off the shackles of Marxism and want to have a bit of fun. The upwardly mobile want to drink cold beers, use clean toilets, and get invited to white weddings. In short, they want to have a life and, though many of their goals might seem venal, crass and petty to us, they are very understandable in a country, where the Communist Party repressed all forms of individualism since 1949.<br /><br />The Chinese, Massonnet points out, are just like the rest of us. They want to enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The people want freedom, the Party wants power. The people, whenever possible, vote with their feet. Some 75% of Chinese students, who get to study overseas, never return to the Middle Kingdom when they graduate. Instead, they pursue the capitalist dream abroad - in America, Japan or Australia. Those who remain at home also have a dream, a dream that, one day, they too will live in freedom, free at last from the shackles of the Communist Party. Although that dream is still some way off, Massonnet, who was Agence France-Presse's Beijing correspondent for many years, is to be congratulated for bringing it to our attention.their feet.

Things begin, and end, with the numbers\\". Not so this book. As well as seemingly endless diversions into such eclectic themes as post war land reform in Japan, General MacArthur's victorious cavalcade into Tokyo, hitch hiking in New England, some unfathomable nonsense about the \\"mystic Southwest\\" of the United States, a reference to Mary Poppins, a couple of paragraphs on Bruce Springsteen, the problems of mowing lawns in Utah, the relatively high mortality rates of upper class Britons during both world wars, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the usual sociological drivel of upwardly pointing nails getting hammered down in Japan, some buzz words from complexity theory, some tips on putting golf balls and interminable pages of insipid tips on how to turn your (non Docomo related) work into fun, we are given six shallow chapters respectively titled Love, Inequality, Impatience, Luck, Fun and Strength with a further appendix called Intimacy and M-Commerce. That is followed by a mercifully short interview with Docomo President Kouji Ohboshi, which, because it was originally carried in 1996, is, like the entire book, totally irrelevant to the current market conditions Docomo faces.<br /><br />Although the book's blurb claims the authors had unprecedented access to Docomo's top executives, there is no evidence of that in this over priced book.  We are, however, told that Ohboshi \\"looks like a conventional Japanese executive. He is tall\\". We are also told that he has the style of a cockroach, meaning that he is impatient and hurries around a lot. Because cockroaches tend to get stamped on, it is a dangerous and, at best, very silly metaphor to describe a dynamic CEO of a thriving company.<br /><br />It is almost as silly as the 20 or so pages given to the digital experiences of Yasuko Sato who, we are told, had to overcome the sad fact that \\"Mama and Papa Sato lovingly, relentlessly instilled good old-fashioned analog values in their daughter.\\" Although Mama and Papa Hayes did the same, I have used mobile phones in the jungles of the Golden Triangle and the Andes Mountains as well as in a fishing trawler 300 miles off the coast of Iceland. Talking about the wonders of i-mode or mobile phones in the tones Mitch and John (as they annoyingly call themselves throughout the book) is like talking of the wonders of black and white TV; they are old news.<br /><br />To impress on us how successful Docomo has been, we are supposed to be amazed that its headquarters are in \\"a skyscraper so large that each elevator holds sixty-three people. Sixty-three! In just one elevator!\\" As if that was not penance enough for us to bear, the authors appeal to our vanity by telling us that we are the new \\"cosmopolitan, global kind of thinker\\" because we are reading a \\"whole book\\" on Docomo.<br /><br />Instead of giving us a \\"whole book\\" on Docomo, all they serve us up is the most shameless padding that would make the laziest high school student blush. Only two paragraphs after mentioning \\"those alphabet soup economics equations that make so little sense to most of us\\", we read \\"Okay, enough about boring economic theories\\" and we are back to the problems of mowing the lawns of Utah.<br /><br />Technical details are also, we are told on page 127, \\"perennially boring\\" even though they are vital to understand Docomo's short history as well as its prospects for future success. The mobile telephony industry Docomo finds itself in is a young industry, one that will mature in time just as wireless, television and the Internet did before it. Until that happens, the industry's many intangibles will complicate our best efforts to predict the industry's future trends. Instead of trying to identify those intangibles, the authors let us know that \\"what we can tell you, after years in think thanks and universities and high-powered consulting firms\\" is that luck is paramount in asuccessful business.<br /><br />This is easily the worst business book I have ever read, let alone reviewed.r />This is easily the worst business book I have ever read, let alone reviewed. <br />	2005-10-01

And the African elephant has the largest earflaps of any animal in history. Lavers explains not only why their huge ears are the key to their curious shape but also to why rats are furry and why King Kong could never have climbed the Empire State Building. The elephant's ears, in case you are wondering, act as radiators, an important consideration if you are a lumbering giant baking under the tropical sun.<br /><br />There is, Lavers's excellent book explains, method to every apparent anomaly in nature.  Gazelles, for example, must be built not only to sprint but to dodge and weave as well. This is because cheetahs, which are renowned sprinters themselves, regard them as little more than mobile larders.<br /><br />Dogs and wolves, on the other hand, are not great sprinters. Instead, they have great stamina and will wear down their prey by sheer perseversence and, well, doggedness.  Lavers also explains such interesting things as why swans glide across the water, whereas vultures hop and ostriches cannot fly at all. He also shows how all of these different attributes go to give us the diversity of life on which we all ultimately depend.<br /><br />This well written book book also explains why the furs of baby harp seals, mink, lynx, snowshoe hares and Arctic foxes are so much in demand but the pelt of a polar bear is not. Lavers also explains how the cubs of polar bears survive the harsh Arctic winter. Although polar cubs are tiny, blind and wet creatures,  lacking in fur, fat and the ability to shiver, yet nature has provided the means for them to survive and become the world's biggest bear in some of the world's most inhospitable terrain. That is but one of Mother Nature's daily miracles that Lavers' book unlocks.<br /><br />The Arizona based spadefoot toad provides another. It spends most of its life encased in cooling mud, emerging only when it rains to have unbridled sexual orgies, massive food binges, and to lay hosts of eggs. Once satiated and once it has ensured the regeneration of its species, it resubmerges itself in the desert's cooling mud.<br /><br />The Saharan scimitar-horned oryx is a large antelope around two meters in length, which lives beneath the blazing Sahara sun. It never seeks shelter, it drinks very little water and yet it thrives by the judicious use of deep night time breathing, which generates sufficient moisture for it to live on.  When the Indonesian based komodo dragon slashes its prey, its filthy fangs cause all kinds of infections, which eventually wear down the unfortunate deer or human it has ambushed. The dragon then saunters after its weakened prey and dines at its leisure.<br /><br />Although hippos occasionally decapitate them by rolling them around in their mouths, crocodiles have been the undisputed king of the tropical world's freshwater systems for the last 65 million years. Because they are so perfectly adapted to their environment, the only enemy they must really fear is man, the great destroyer. Because we have introduced such ecological vandals as goats, rabbits, cats, rats and mice to fragile ecological systems like Australia and New Zealand, we have done more damage to the environment than anything else since the dinosaurs became extinct.<br /><br />As well as being replete with fascinating examples such as these, Lavers' book is particularly recommended because its judicious combination of examples such as with an eminently readable style, shows how our own existence is ultimately entwined with the complex life styles of all of those other vreatures, both great and small.xual orgies, massive food binges, and to lay hosts of eggs.

He also suggests some compelling reasons why Adams, who has always denied ever being a member of the IRA, should be tried as a war criminal.<br />Chief among these is the horrific case of Jean McKinney, a Protestant widow with ten young children, who was abducted and murdered by the IRA in 1972 because she gave a dying British soldier a glass of water. For more than twenty five years, the IRA denied that they were responsible for her abduction and subsequent murder. Jean McKinney's body lay in an unmarked grave for over 25 years as the IRA peace negotiators munched on their their prawn sandwiches with their British counterparts.<br /><br />Moloney alleges that Adams authorized McKinney's murder as well as scores of others. He also hints that IRA activists sympathetic to Adams sabotaged key IRA operations and even helped the British Special Air Service (SAS) eliminate their most lethal and dangerous colleagues. The most notorious of these were the eight IRA men under the command of Jim Lynagh who were lured into a SAS ambush at Loughall. The SAS killed all eight, pumping twelve hundred high caliber bullets, an average of 150 bullets each, into the IRA men in the process. Moloney alleges Lynagh's squad was sacrificed to enable Adams to sell the Peace Process to the others.<br />Yes and no! Adams was playing his games, running with the IRA hares and hunting with the British hounds nad doubleagents like Stakeknife. But Lynagh and his crew were going around demolishing police barracks all over East Tyrone. So the SAS may have just staked out Loughall waiting for the IRA to show up. In the John Le Carre world of international terrorism and subterfuge, who can really tell what side the political players - Orwell's social climbers with bombs - are really on?<br /><br />There is plenty more in that vein. The book is riddled through with the webs of intrigue and tales of sordid betrayal we normally associate with John Le Carre's Cold War thrillers. Although the book is, on the surface, a tale of how one Irish terrorist, Gerry Adams, came in from the cold and ended up dining in the White House with US President Bill Clinton, it is, at heart, an engrossing account of how devious and disreputable a game the politics of peace making is.<br /><br />Although Moloney might like to believe that Adams and his closest confidents deserve the Nobel Prize for taking some of their guns out of Irish politics, there is another side to all this that Moloney's book could have dealt with at greater length. The IRA has meted out unjustifiable violence to the Irish people, most of whom will never forgive or forget their nefarious deeds. That being so, the Adams inspired peace process cannot ever fully succeed. That fundamental reality apart, Moloney has accurately depicted Northern Ireland's Troubles as the dirty, squalid war that it was, where secretive, amoral groups, often working through informers and double agents, had no qualms about spilling the blood of uninvolved innocents or, for that matter, of their factional rivals.<br /><br />Perhaps Adams should be given the Nobel Peace Prize for his contribution; others, after all, have been awarded Nobel Prizes for less. Far better would it be if the lies, duplicity and double dealing, which Moloney contends were the hallmark of Adams and his IRA colleagues, were to disappear forever from the face of the earth. The strength of Moloney's book is that he so accurately catalogues the IRA's use of the lie and the double cross. The weakness is that he does not explain how habitual liars and double crossers can be trusted to guarantee a lasting peace.<br /><br />Because the moral price for bringing Gerry Adams in from the cold has been so high, the neutral reader must almost certainly feel that Northern Ireland's non combatants have been short changed. Although peace has always to be preferred to war, Moloney gives the strong impression that not even Gerry Adams could explain what all the violence was for in the first place. The upward social mobility of a few Provo Taigs apart, I'm damned if I know what it was all for.nd's non combatants have been short changed.

By Nicholas Dunbar.<br /><br />When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management. By Roger Lowenstein. Random House .<br /><br />Long Term Credit Management's demise is one of a number of recent high profile collapses involving the world's derivatives markets. Other recent ones include those of Sumitomo's chief copper trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, who lost $1.8 billion during a decade of unauthorized dealing and price manipulation in the copper market; Orange County's $1.7 billion loss on risky, highly leveraged investments on the direction of interest rates; Metallgesellschaft's $900 million loss on crude oil hedges; and, of course the activities of Nicholas Leeson, Baring's infamous Rogue Trader.<br /><br />All of these cases throw forward lessons I use in my Futures and Option classes at Sophia University. Important though they are, the main textbooks remain those written by such Nobel Prize winners as Robert Merton and Myron Scholes. The irony is that both of these geniuses were centrally involved in LTCM's demise. Despite their faux paus, their works remain seminal. They are brainy guys. Unfortunately, brains are not enough. Genius sometimes fails.<br /><br />LTCB was actually very short-term focused. Their assets consisted of a gigantic pile of extremely short-term pieces of paper leveraged to an unimaginable degree. They bought vast amounts of government paper and borrowed even greater amounts to pay for it. When Russia's markets collapsed in 1998, so did LTCM. The bank's complex mathematical bets on discrepancies in values amongst different bonds and derivatives came dramatically unstuck. Its US$7 billion capital base was eroded overnight. Most of LTCM's bets were in credit spreads, particularly European ones in the run-up to European monetary union. Essentially, LTCM held two different instruments - usually Italian, Greek or Danish bonds - and bet that the spread between the rates they offered and their German and American equivalents would narrow.<br /><br />When the Russian government defaulted on its debt, credit spreads in all markets widened suddenly and spectacularly as investors stampeded into the safest of safe havens. Investors fled Italian bonds, Brady bonds and every other relatively risky bond that LTCB depended on for sustenance. Borrowings had put LTCM's total exposure at more than US$100 billion, more than fourteen times its equity base. Most of this money had been sunk in derivatives. As its positions worsened, its daily margin calls bankrupted it. LTCB made the cardinal mistake of not cutting its losses. It threw good money after bad, believing that its fortunes would reverse. They didn't. Unable to meet margin calls, LTCB asked the US Federal Reserve Bank to bail it out. The Fed, afraid that LTCM's collapse might imperil the world's entire system, duly obliged.<br /><br />Because LTCB was comprised of Wall Street's best and brightest, there are lessons galore to be learned here for students and practitioners alike. Unfortunately, these two books do not do full justice to the lessons this case brings out. Lowenstein is a very successful American financial journalist and his book is by far the easier to read. He discusses the main characters involved in the debacle. Unfortunately for him, most of the main players have no real personalities to speak of at all. They are the so-called rocket scientists, the guys and gals with the quantitative expertise necessary to implement the complex strategies LTCM's Nobel Prize winners devised. To do them justice, one also needs a quantitative background. And because Lowenstein lacks this background, his book, though an enjoyable read, is peppered with potentially serious mistakes. And, in the world of derivatives, mistakes can be extremely costly.<br /><br />Dunbar has the quantitative background Lowenstein lacks. However, Dunbar wanders far from this. He discusses such irrelevant things as the role Chicago's grain markets played in America's civil war. He also spends more than half the book explaining how option pricing developed and the key role Scholes and Merton played in that process. Countless other books and articles, including those by Scholes and Merton, do this much better. Dunbar's book should have concentrated more on LTCM's collapse - he spends les than 50 pages on it - and less on America's Civil War.<br /><br />Therefore although Lowenstein's book is stronger on the human side of the LTCM debacle, Dunbar's is more technically correct - even though it has also considerable shortcomings in that regard. If Hollywood had to choose between them, it would choose Lowenstein's book. However, Hollywood aside, neither will notch up significant sales in academia or in business circles. Academics and practitioners will continue to plump for the penmanship of Merton, Scholes and their like. At least they have the theory right, even if they sometimes get the practice wrong with the devastating results LTCM's demise typifies. In the end, the faulty scholarship evident in both books and the faulty strategies propounded by both Nobel Prize winners drive home the old message of caveat emptor, buyer beware.scusses such irrelevant things as the role Chicago's grain markets played in America's civil war.

The slaves raise their young, gather food for them and keep their homes clean. The Protos excel only at capturing the Lepts, who are remarkably loyal to their Proto masters, even becoming ferocious participants in slave-raids on their own kind. Both the Protos and Lepts are tiny ants, who live out their inter dependent lives in a world no bigger than a dinner table. They are only one of the many mysteries of nature this fascinating book brings to our attention.<br /><br />Whereas stick insects use ants to disperse their eggs, the scuttle fly lays its eggs in the heads of the unfortunate ants it preys on.  Some wasps lay their eggs within the eggs of stick insects while others fool ants into believing that their offspring are ants. The South American crab spider fools carpenter ants by carrying a dead ant in such a way that it walks, smells and looks like an ant. This neat trick allows the spider ant to capture and kill another dumb ant and repeat its bizarre ritual.<br /><br />Because some 289,000 species of insects act as pollinators of flowering plan, Agosta's fine book shows how and why a lot of deals are cut for self-survival reasons. A single pound of honey, for example, represents the nectar from about 17,000 foraging trips and entails 7,000 bee-hours of labor. The flowers must have all kinds of sophisticated strategies to ensure the busy bees spread their seed. The rhizanthella gardneri, an Australian orchid, must have a peculiarly singular strategy; this is because it blooms underground and depends on scuttle flies to pollinate it. Chimpanzees and parrots, meanwhile, eat special plants when they are sick and some bacteria contain particles that act as compasses.<br /><br />Life is strange - especially, as Agosta explains, for flower mites, which hitch rides with migrating hummingbirds, spending their summers on the California coast and winter in west-central Mexico. They do this by climbing into the bird's nostrils and alighting at the right flower to survive. They have less than 5 seconds to alight and achieve their \\"Mission Impossible\\". Older female mice, meanwhile, trick younger ones into not procreating, a case perhaps of brains over beauty!<br /><br />As well as discussing a fascinating number of such examples, Agosta ventures further to show how history has been influenced by the lowliest of creatures. Although we generally loathe flies as disgusting creatures, without them, the author shows how our destiny would have been vastly different. Their diseases decimated Napoleon's Haitian army, forced him to sell Louisiana for a pittance to the United States and to abandon the Americas almost entirely. Malaria caused five times more casualties in the Pacific war than did the combatants. Because it is so lethal to humans and their domesticated animals, the tsetse fly keeps large swathes of Africa relatively underdeveloped. However, we are now using cattle urine to trap and exterminate them.<br /><br />This is not as novel as it sounds. Agosta explains how our ancestors used the urine of wolves and dogs to trap deer. Prof. Agosta also gives us details of a company that sells over the Internet \\"100% predator urine\\" to repel raccoon, deer and other unwanted animals.<br /><br />We live in a beautiful, complex but delicate ecology, where, as the author maintains, mutually beneficial bargains are done to ensure mutual survival. We have upset this balance immeasurably and, as Prof. Agosta's excellent book makes plain, we better make amends if we want the beautiful paradise of nature we have inherited to continue.Mexico.

This interesting book wheels out Robert Fisk and other well known journalists and commentators to state the obvious: many Europeans, very many Muslims and a very large number of Americans find America's policy on the Middle East and other key flashpoint areas to be extremely partisan, selfish and self serving and, though these people might stand in understandable awe at America's overwhelming military might, yet they find the naked display of that might to be sickening in the extreme. The book contends that, contrary to what right wing Americans pundits might think, these people who hate America are not so much jealous of America's socio-economic successes as they are repelled by the notion that American might makes America right.<br /><br />Fittingly enough, perhaps, in this age of globalization, the authors contend that \\"loathing for America is about as close as we can get to a universal sentiment: it is the one dynamic that unites fundamentalists and liberals, Arabs and Latin Americans, Asians and Europeans, and even the overshadowed Canadians, with the rest of the world\\".<br /><br />In presenting their arguments why this is so, the authors will get little disagreement from me. That is because there is little new or novel here for those of us who have tracked the hypocrisies and contradictions of American imperial policy down the ages. The genocide of the native Americans, the imperial arrogance of the Monroe Doctrine, America's funding of Latin American death squads, and the almost Pavlovian response of American Presidents to \\"send in the marines\\" at the drop of a hat to places as diverse as the Philippines, Cuba, Nicaragua, Iran, Yugoslavia, China, Oman, Angola and Lebanon are all well trodden ground by veritable armies of well meaning writers from former days.<br /><br />Instead of treating us to lengthy discourses on the contradictions of American foreign policy or on how America has consistently denied liberty, equality and fraternity to those other countries who meant it no harm, the authors propound their case by constantly referring to American movies, American television series and the great love Americans have for that most ubiquitous of all fast foods, the hamburger: chapter four is actually titled American hamburgers and other viruses.<br /><br />Although these constant references to America's fast food fetishes and third rate American movies and television series often grate on the nerves, yet they serve a useful purpose by getting readers to focus in on the reasons why, as page 14 tells us, \\"Americans have become... the most hated people on earth\\". These reasons include America's domination of bodies like the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, NATO and the United Nations; the demonization by Hollywood of Islam and other legitimate worldviews; the use of American ordinance by Israel to kill Palestinians and, not least, the loathing most people feel to overbearing bullies.<br /><br />Although this slim tome is not the definitive guide to the rise and fall of the American Empire, yet it can give us much food for thought. The authors, for example, finish with the famous quote from St. Francis of Assisi imploring his Master to enable him to love, understand and console his fellow humans. St. Francis, of course, spent considerable time traveling with the Saracens during the Crusades and, not surprisingly perhaps, he found them to be much more devout, more civilized and infinitely more genteel than the marauding Crusaders ever were.<br /><br />The excesses of the Crusaders still poison relations between Western Europe and the Orthodox and Muslim worlds to this day. The Pax Americana is no different: the Americans can no more hope to win friends and influence people with their Tomahawk missiles or B 52 bombers than the Crusaders could with their sabers and cutlasses.  Although the authors' plea to the Americans to give peace a chance might be as naïve as the pleas of John Lennon and Yoko Ono were, yet it is no less valuable for that and if you think this book will help to build peace and real understanding, then you should go out and buy yourself a copy today.is no less valuable for that and if you think this book will help to build peace and real understanding, then you should go out and buy yourself a copy today. <br /> <br />	2005-10-01

What if plants have their own agenda and we are merely their unwitting agents?<br /><br />Because there are over 50 million dogs in the USA and only 10,000 wolves, the dog obviously knows something about self-survival that the wolf does not. Whereas wolves have paid the price of not making their peace with us, dogs have adapted to our venal needs and thrived.<br /><br />Dogs have not been alone. Apples have used us to propagate on all four corners of the earth. John Chapman, better known to generations of school kids as Johnny Appleseed, was their instrument of choice in the United States; he traveled the American frontier planting apple orchards everywhere he went. America's frontiersmen got cider, Johnny Appleseed got rich and the apple got a new continent to colonize.<br /><br />Tulips accomplished a similar feat in Puritan Holland between 1634 and 1637, when the citizens of that wealthy state paid fortunes for tulips, whose beauty was caused by a virus of all things. The tulip later led to the overthrow of Turkey's Sultan Ahmed 111 in 1730 after he expended his empire's entire finances on importing convoys of tulips from Amsterdam. Ahmed would put on elaborate displays for his tulips, where songbirds in gilded cages supplied the music, and hundreds of giant tortoises carrying candles on their back lumbered through his vast gardens of tulips. His many mistresses and the eunuchs attending them were also made to worship the plants. Unfortunately for him, his subjects got sick of footing the bill. Like the Calvinistic Dutch before him, Ahmed had been beguiled and then bankrupted by their beauty.<br /><br />The marijuana plant beguiles people not by its beauty but by its ability to alter their space-time coordinates. Just as an Ethiopian goat is credited with discovering coffee beans, so also does Morris credit the jaguar with discovering the hallucinary powers of the bark of the yaje vine and pigeons in ancient China with discovering something similar with cannabis seeds.<br /><br />Drug crazed jaguars apart, the marijuana chapter is the weakest in the book. Not only does he lavish too much praise on this infamous weed and on the Americans and Dutch who propagate it, but he engages in too much idle speculation on Apollo, Dionysus, Nietzsche, Zen masters, Emerson, George Eliot, Aldous Huxley, vanilla ice cream and other juvenile topics.<br /><br />His chapter on the potato could, by contrast, have done with a lengthier treatment. He alleges that the devastating potato failures that decimated the Irish population from 1845 to 1850 were as much designed to break their financial independence as to the monoculture their landlords foisted upon them. More interestingly still, he links that seminal disaster to the efforts of Monsanto to mass-produce genetically modified food today. He makes the point that our craving for McDonald's French Fries has ensured that millions of acres are now the sole preserve of Russet Burbank potatoes and the tons of toxic chemicals that sustain them. Americans, for example, spray their potato fields with an organophosphate called Monitor that damages the human nervous system and does untold damage to the soil. The Incas, who were much smarter at these things, diversified; they grew a staggering variety of potatoes that could collectively stand up to anything Mother Nature might throw at them.<br /><br />We, on the other hand, have betrayed nature. In handing ourselves over to useless plants like tulips and dangerous ones like marijuana, while stifling the evolution of useful ones like apples and potatoes, we are setting the seeds for our future destruction. The plants, in other words, have a story to go along with their agenda.

Not only has he to listen to puerile songs like the above but he seems to be a remarkably shallow character for one who is supposed to be the incarnation of evil. To give him his due, he can, however, glow in the dark like one of the side kicks in the Sky High movie. Not very much admittedly but he can emit rays of light which is helpful when God plunges his capital into darkness.<br /><br />Nicholae's followers spend a considerable amount of time in this book groping around in the dark. This is because the authors of this very popular series take their lines almost literally from The Book of Revelations, which forms the last book in the New Testament. Because God plunged the anti Christ's headquarters into darkness, Nick has to suffer. And so do the readers of this awful book.<br /><br />In Armageddon the eleventh book in the Left Behind series, Nick has taken over the world and, a few Jewish and Christian believers apart, everyone else is happy enough to pay homage to him even if it means eternal damnation in the fires of hell. These include Krystall, Nick's very polite personal secretary, who, even though she accepts her own eternal damnation for taking Nick's mark, feeds the Christian rebels information for her own peculiar reasons.<br /><br />Although one would expect the anti Christ to take a very dim view of those who betray him, Nick is too preoccupied with crushing the rebels to bother himself with Krystall's treachery. As part of this process, and to foreshadow the apocalyptic fight ahead, Nick cobbles together the biggest army ever assembled in the history of the world and he equips it with the best weaponry available. As a result of these preparations, Nick feels confident he can defeat God's army. To this end, he rides a horse. And many of his soldiers also ride horses.<br /><br />Although this might make bad military sense, it accords with the Book of Revelations where the anti Christ leads his forces into battle on a horse. The Book of Revelations, unfortunately, is not the only part of the Bible to permeate this boring book. God, for example, feeds the Christian rebels with manna from heaven, just as Exodus 16.31 informs us He fed Moses and his followers when they fled Egypt. When the believers are not gorging themselves on manna, they are using the Internet to read whatever battle tips the Bible has to offer as they attempt to defeat Nick.<br /><br />Nick must be a technophobe. Not only does he ride a horse into battle but his forces, which control the world, cannot even close down a very popular underground Christian site. If the Christians in this book are anything to go by, one would almost have to wish him well. These Christians are a pompous myopic lot.  They delight in telling Krystall and other unfortunates that God has prepared a very warm spot for them in Hell and they seem to be unable to string a handful of sentences together without throwing in a few biblical quotes as well.<br /><br />Although Nicholae Carpathia may not sport a hoof, a trident and a cloven foot, yet he may as well: he is as much a caricature as Lucifer or Old Nick himself ever were. Unfortunately, he is not so scary. This is because his character, like all the other characters in this puffed up book, lacks any depth or subtlety at all. That is not his fault but the fault of the writers who feel compelled to churn out as much \\"Christian literature\\" as quickly as they can.<br /><br />Jenkins even has a writing school to foster more Christian clones to help spread \\"the Word\\". But the Bible has some very beautiful writing in it and it does offer many words of wisdom to the wise. The same cannot be said of the Left Behindseries of books. They are low grade propaganda: the mystery is why they sell so well. If Christian parents are forcing their children to read this drivel, our hearts have to go out to them. And to Nicholae Carpathia, the anti Christ, who thinks it is ok to ride into battle on a horse.e mystery is why they sell so well.

US	38872130	R1P8CB67OWHFPX	0393020029	912019107	Harvard and the Unabomber: The Education of an American Terrorist	Books	5	4	10	N	N	Top of the Class	This excellent book on Theodore John Kaczynski, America's infamous Unabomber, begins, aptly enough, with quotes from Nazi mass murder Adolf Eichmann, the prototype of evil cloaked in drab banality and Kurtz, the warped genius at the center of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The strength of the book is that it shows how Harvard's curriculum helped to inspire the Unabomber's deeds; I could not find any weaknesses in this highly recommended book.<br /><br />The author, another Harvard graduate, who also fled academia for the Montana wilderness, shows how the Unabomber's ideas were forged in the smithy of Harvard's lecture halls and - a worrying thought - he quotes academics who find the Unabomber's beliefs quite mainstream, reasonable and rational.<br /><br />Although the Unabomber later taught mathematics at Michigan and Berkeley at the height of their anti Vietnam riots, Chase claims that Kaczynski's lethal future was set at Harvard, where he was the subject of wildly irresponsible psychological experiments conducted by maverick psychology pioneer Henry A. Murray who, as well as being an amphetamines addict, wore green skirts and pearl bracelets to bed, carried on a sado-masochistic affair with Christina Councilman Morgan, his Harvard collaborator and went on acid trips with LSD guru Timothy Leary and other Harvard colleagues and students. Chase says that Kaczynski had to contend not only with unstable people like Murray but that he also had to wade through Harvard's insufferable General Education curriculum requirements before being allowed to turn his hand to mathematics, his chosen area of study.<br /><br />The book's greatest strength is in showing not only the redundancy but also the dangers of Harvard's General Education system. The book is littered with allusions to many of my own favorite great works: dark tomes such as Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, Heart of Darkness, Darkness at Noon, Les Miserables and Mann's Dr Faustus. Chaucer and Joyce's Finnegans Wake also figure in that the Unabomber used them, in rather puerile fashion, one might add, to taunt the FBI with his own supposed brilliance. Although some of these authors - Dostoyevski's rather anarchic Notes from the Underground in particular - seemed to have figured prominently in Harvard's General Education program, the books' moral lessons were completely omitted. The lessons of Jean Valjean and Raskolnikov are, of course, those of redemption, a recurring motif in Western literature as anyone familiar with the Greek legends of Prometheus or the Bible can attest.<br /><br />Although the book is studded with very pertinent allusions to these and other classics, this is not a case of the author showing how well read he would like us to think he is. Rather it is a case of Chase showing us how Harvard's ill conceived educational system molded one serial killer and how, given the well established link between higher education and mass killing, the American educational system might even now be weaning future and more lethal mass murderers.<br /><br />Although a little education is truly a dangerous thing, this particularly applies to environments like Harvard where General Education and so called inter disciplinary programs are used as poor replacements for well established codes of ethics such as the Ten Commandments. Such courses are insipid and useless precisely because they are ethically neutral and morally rudderless. The dangers of a little knowledge should be evident not only from a reading of Crime and Punishment but also from a familiarity with the fables of Prometheus or the Garden of Eden, in both of which the sin of hubris, of overweening pride and arrogance, loomed large.<br /><br />Chase shows that Kaczynski became a cold blooded killer not despite his intellect but because of it. His intellect, far from acting as a brake on his descent into the abyss, actually accelerated his fall.<br /><br />Chase cites the pressures on the Unabomber's long suffering mother, whom Kaczynski continued to blame for his own considerable shortcomings even as he bombed total strangers to smithereens and he details Harvard's petty snobbery and Murray's unethical psychological experiments on vulnerable students, Kaczynski included, which were in total violation of the Nuremberg Code, devised after the infamous Nuremberg Trials of Hitler's leading cronies which dealt with similar matters. Although Harvard has undoubtedly a case to answer, its shortcomings or, indeed the understandable ambitions of his unfortunate mother, can in no way mitigate the Unabomber's own actions.<br /><br />Like Faust and Raskolnikov before him, Kaczynski made his pact with the devil. Like Kurtz, he stupidly thought he was wise enough to strike the better deal. Like Frankenstein, the modern Prometheus, he too suffered from hubris, the original sin of Prometheus, Kurtz and a galaxy of others who now lie within Dante's Seventh Circle. Kaczynski, in his eagerness to become a pitiable Superman, spurned the lessons of Heart of Darkness, Faust, Crime and Punishment and Les Miserables. Their main lesson is as old as the Greek myths: it is that knowledge without faith and ethics is not only meaningless but is also a downright dangerous thing. And now, as he languishes in an American Federal Prison, he might also take time to ponder on some simpler messages, such as the very plain, simple and logical one of the Fifth Commandment which informs us that we do not have a license to kill.abomber's long suffering mother, whom Kaczynski continued to blame for his own considerable shortcomings even as he bombed total strangers to smithereens and he details Harvard's petty snobbery and Murray's unethical psychological experiments on vulnerable students, Kaczynski included, which were in total violation of the Nuremberg Code, devised after the infamous Nuremberg Trials of Hitler's leading cronies which dealt with similar matters.

Pharaoh and the Egyptians (Exodus 1:15-22) and Haman and the Persians (Book of Esther) both predated Hitler by several thousand years. Jewish massacres were so common in Tsarist Russia that the word they coined for it, pogrom, is now an accepted part of our own lexicon.<br /><br />Karl Marx's \\"On The Jewish Question\\" reads like a particularly acrid Nazi call to slaughter - a considerable irony, given that he was descended from a long line of distinguished rabbis. Both Voltaire and Pierre Joseph Proudhon, the founder of French socialism, were notorious anti-Semites. Indeed, the historian Zosa Szajkowski in 1947 claimed that he could not find a single word written on behalf of the Jews in the whole of French socialist literature from 1820 to 1920.<br /><br />Julius Streicher cogently argued in his own defense at the Nuremberg trials that he had never said or done anything against the Jews, which Martin Luther had not advocated four hundred years earlier. The Nazis' final solution was, in other words, the culmination of some of the worst strains in European intellectual thought.<br /><br />These unpalatable truths make James Carroll's theme, the persecution Jews have suffered at the hands of European Christians, Roman Catholics in particular, a particularly worthy one. Unfortunately, he lacks the objectivity to give the theme the full justice it deserves. Instead, he ridicules the simple Catholicism of his Irish American mother, and waffles interminably on about his own strained relationship with Rome. The German Catholics who perform the world famous Easter play at Oberammergau also feel his wrath. This is because Carroll believes that all public manifestations of the Catholic faith are, ipso facto, crude displays of anti Semitism designed by Goebbels like figures to warp simple minds like his own.<br /><br />Catholics did not concoct the Nazi's final solution. It took educated secularists, like Dr. Otto Hofmann of the SS Race and Settlement Office, Dr. Gerhard Klopfer of the Party Chancellery, and Dr. Wilhelm Stuckart of the Interior Ministry to do that. Carroll would have been better off firing his salvoes against those learned men and the respected institutions that spawned them, instead of directing his barbs against ordinary people like his own mother.<br /><br />Although Hitler's Final Solution worked almost to perfection in Holland, Hungary, France and Poland, it failed dismally in Denmark, Belgium, Romania and Bulgaria. It failed totally in Finland. Religion and a keen sense of civil society and responsibility played a key role in all its partial defeats. Carroll, in ignoring all of that, has not served us up a good book. Nor has he served the truth particularly well. And for that, the half-baked Catholics and shallow theologians who educated him at Georgetown and Harvard must take some of the blame. If this book is any indicator, all they seem to serve up to their charges is a catechism of clich&eacute;s lacking both a theme and, Carroll's 140 pages of irrelevant notes and appendices notwithstanding, academic depth and rigor.<br /><br />In between a maze of irrelevant diversions and personal musings, Carroll's core point is that the Catholic Church should not have collaborated with earthly powers, from the Emperor Constantine down to Hitler and beyond. Nor, of course, in an ideal world, should the Russian Orthodox Church have collaborated with Stalin. However, like their Orthodox brethren who survived the Gulag years, many Catholics now doubt the efficacy of being wantonly fed to the lions for the amusement of the baying mob. To deliberately seek martyrdom is, in other words, as grievous a sin as is the refusal to resist evil. The pragmatic medium trod, inter alia by the Russian patriarchs and Popes Pius X1 and Pius X11 is, paradoxically, perhaps the hardest road of all.<br /><br />The Catholic Church, just like the Orthodox Churches, is guilty of grievous sins against both God and man. The current pope has made some appeals, however belated, for forgiveness from Europe's Jews. There is, in Europe, a lot to forgive and a lot to heal. Although the sins of our fathers, along with our own more considerable ones, call for atonement, this large but hollow book will not aid in that process.against both God and man.

US	38872130	R1TC2D7D5FWI0U	0674009940	531535759	Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe	Books	5	15	19	N	N	Excellent and overdue	Despite its considerable faults, this book is a terrible indictment of our common humanity. Much of it traverses well-trod ground such as the Armenian and Jewish genocides and the more recent wars of the Yugoslav succession. Other chapters deal with the expulsion of the Greeks from Anatolia and the Soviet deportation of the Chechens-Ingush and the Crimean Tatars.<br /><br />The book's strongest chapter chronicles the post-war expulsion of German civilians from Poland and Czechoslovakia, where German girls and women were routinely raped by their former neighbors and where the Soviets, who were notorious rapists themselves, were  welcomed as comparative saviors by the Germans. The Germans of Bohemia, Silesia and Sudetenland are compared to the Jews caught between the marauding armies of Hitler and Stalin as they carved up Poland. Neither group knew where to go. Many ended up dying in concentration camps, robbed, humiliated and finally murdered. There is little to be proud of and much to be ashamed of in robbing, raping, humiliating and murdering unarmed women and children.<br /><br />Naimark speaks of Serbs being ordered to rape Muslim women and Wehrmacht soldiers looking on with smirks on their faces as their Lithuanian, Ukranian and Latvian allies raped Jewish women. Naimark tells us of Polish, German, Czech and Turkish concentration camp guards going beyond rape and revelling in all kinds of unspeakable cruelties on their defenseless charges<br /><br />Why do men do such things? Naimark, a Harvard University history professor, trots out a few glib sociological reasons. He blames conniving politicians, people like Hitler, Slobodan Milosovic and their cronies, people like the SS and Arkan's Serb Tigers. That, like most of the book, is too simplistic. The truth is that all of us are to blame. All of us are guilty. Good Samaritans, as this book makes plain, are a rare commodity when the dogs of war are let loose. Most of us prefer the sports pages to accounts of what the Hutus and Tutsis are doing to each other. They have lost their novelty value for us. Because their crimes are no longer novel, they no longer attract our attention. And even if they did, what would we do? Probably, if the evidence is anything to go by, nothing.<br /><br />Naimark makes the point that the Armenian genocide was proclaimed in headlines around the world. Hitler's antipathy to the Jews was hardly a state secret. Stalin is one of history's greatest mass murderers and his treatment of the Chechens and Tatars could hardly have come as a surprise to anyone familiar with his ways.<br /><br />The role of Winston Churchill and other Western leaders is less familiar. Naimark mentions how Churchill and Stalin briefly discussed the plight of the Sudetenland Germans; Churchill was willing to see two million of them die and the rest shoved into an impoverished Bavaria. In less than a minute, these two same men assigned Yugoslavia to the Soviets in return for Greece remaining within the British sphere of interest. The fates of millions didn't cause either of them to lose any sleep. Nor have the Germans or the Austrians lost much sleep over their cynical involvement in the  carve-up of Yugoslavia.<br /><br />We probably don't lose too much sleep either about these disputes in far-off European lands of which we know so little. That, of course, is the problem. For evil to triumph, it is just necessary for good people to do nothing. That, in a nutshell, has been the lesson both of Europe in the twentieth century and of this disturbing book, which reminds us of one of Europe's most permanent and invidious cancers.<br /><br />The issue of preventable cancers is now back on the agenda as the world's press belatedly considers the use of depleted uranium against the Serbs. In the end, cancers and hatreds seem to be war's only legacies and our only common inheritances. Surely, as we go into a new millennium, we should be able to do better than to hate, rape and kill. This book suggests otherwise. Although many idealists may believe that peace is worth dying for, this book shows that many of the less idealistic believe that faith, fatherland and material advantage are all worth killing for. Rape, gang rape and rape murder were part of everyday life. Postscript: I air many of these issues in my new book.many idealists may believe that peace is worth dying for, this book shows that many of the less idealistic believe that faith, fatherland and material advantage are all worth killing for.

US	38872130	RM0TH0WRT1Q5S	0142002801	435949952	The Fall of Berlin 1945	Books	3	7	14	N	N	shallow or wrong target?	The need for a definitive book on the fall of Berlin remains important for a variety of reasons. These include the need to examine the tactics General Heinrici used at the crucial battle for the Seelow Heights to fend off the vastly superior Soviet armies; Hitler's countermanding orders, which made Heinrici's job of defending Berlin impossible; the gang rapes and other crimes against humanity committed, with Stalin's blessing, by the Soviet conquerors; and the terrible suffering inflicted on the Berliners and East Prussians as a result of Hitler's refusal to see reason and capitulate. Because the definitive book dealing with the fall of Berlin would clearly show both the appalling suffering Hitler's criminal adventurism inflicted on the Germans and the cowardliness of the Nazi leaders when faced with the Soviets, it would thereby also serve the higher purpose of dampening resurgent neo Nazism by exposing the inherent contradictions, military ineptness and total senselessness of Adolf Hitler, its main icon.<br /><br />Anthony Beevor's new book is not that definitive book. Heinrici and the Seelow Heights, for example, are first mentioned on page 216. The preceding 14 chapters are given over to speculating on the motives of Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin, as well as a galaxy of lesser Russian generals. Rasputin is mentioned in passing and Eisenhower, in particular, and the Americans, in general, are wrongly depicted as naïve simpletons, easily outfoxed by the wily Stalin.<br /><br />Instead of dealing with the logistical problems the German generals faced and with the criminal recklessness of Hitler and his closest henchmen, Beevor treats us to irrelevant speculation about Hitler's homosexual tendencies, and the love of motion pictures he shared with Eva Braun. The book would have been considerably enhanced by telling us less about Eva Braun's jewelry collection and more about the Soviets' ethnic cleansing of East Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia, which reduced the German population there from 2.2 million to 193,000. Beevor could also have dealt more with Erich Koch and other Nazi fanatics, who wantonly sacrificed old men and young boys to the Soviet juggernaut before making a bolt for the American lines themselves.<br /><br />Instead of dealing with these issues, his book is peppered with allegations of mass rape by the invading Soviets. Beevor never comprehensively deals with this important issue,  but constantly returns to it, as if he just wants to titillate the readers or use those disgusting Soviet crimes to shore up his rambling discourse. I found his constant refrain that older German women declared that it was better to be gang raped by Soviet soldiers than to be bombed by the Americans to be particularly nauseating, especially when coupled with his rambling diatribes supposedly explaining why soldiers, Soviet ones in particular, tended to rape and pillage as the fancy took them. Though the reader might be led to believe that raping defenseless women is part and parcel of military warfare, it is quite properly regarded as a war crime, and a very hideous one at that.<br /><br />In between the author's superfluous and unoriginal speculation about the intrigues of those closest to Hitler, there are some interesting nuggets that could have done with lengthier treatment. These include the tragic fate of the Poles, who, despite their six years of unparalleled bravery, merely exchanged one totalitarian master for another; the six Goebells children, murdered by their parents in homage to Hitler; the French, Danish, Belgian, Dutch and Norwegian SS units, who fought to the very end to protect the Reichstag; the toll, which typhus, dysentery, diphtheria and other infectious diseases exacted on the Germans; and the logistical crises in fuel and transport which the East Prussian exodus precipitated among the remnants of the German Wehrmacht.<br /><br />The author should have concentrated more on those topics and less on the puerile palace politics of Hitler's cronies. More tellingly, perhaps, his broad brush approach, coupled with his many irrelevant diversions, also means that there is little new in this book. If he had instead explained why the Germans so blindly followed buffoons like Hitler, Goring and Himmler, especially given Hitler's consistent refusal to allow the evacuation of encircled troops and his pattern of enforced sacrifice and senseless suffering, the book might have served the higher purpose of discrediting Hitlerism; as it stands, it will merely inflate the author's bank balance for a few years before it fades into well deserved oblivion.s cronies.

The book opens with the July 4th 1976 bicentennial celebration of American independence and closes with the death of Hollywood star Rock Hudson, whose passing garnered the necessary oxygen of publicity that all the thousands of previous AIDS casualties could not.<br /><br />In between, the book revolves around the hedonistic community of San Francisco's Castro Street area and brings us an amazing array of villains, victims and plain heroes. The villains include the bathhouse owners, who used America's First Amendment to keep their businesses open even as it was blatantly obvious that they were a major conduit for the spread of the virus; Dr. Bob Gallo of America's National Cancer Institute, who put his own prestige ahead of everything else, normal scientific and academic ethics included; and the Reagan administration, which did as little as politically possible to stem the burgeoning plague that blighted America during those years.<br /><br />Because the air bridges between Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco helped spread the virus at breakneck speed, Shilts also introduces us to Gaetan Dugas, the Canadian air line steward, who is credited with infecting many of America's earliest victims. Shilts paints him as half victim and half villain.  Dugas, he shows, went from being the pretty boy everybody in Castro Street wanted to bed to being the terminal AIDS case they all eventually feared.<br /><br />Rock Hudson, Liberace and other closet gays are likewise painted as half villains and half victims. Michael Foucault, the fashionable French philosopher, must rank with the vilest villains; he hid his diagnosis from everyone, even his devoted lover. So much for that pompous philosopher and philanderer!<br /><br />But even in the blighted world of AIDS, there were many heroes. These include the French scientists who discovered the HIV virus and, Gallo excepted, the American ones, who followed up all the early clues that eventually led to the discovery of the medications that can now tackle the illness. Many of these American heroes, Shilts shows, were penalized rather than praised by their universities for performing their singular services to mankind.<br /><br />The bathhouse chain owners, who were more interested in profiting from the unbridled orgies that gave them their profits than in stemming AIDS, were not the only amplifiers during the crucial early years. The blood banks, by refusing to screen blood, also contributed to the death of thousands of Americans. The Reagan administration's preoccupation with Central America and the Soviet Union was also a godsend to the virus.<br /><br />And, as the band played on, AIDS wormed its way through America's marginalized communities of hookers, hemophiliacs, heroin addicts, and Haitians. Gay activists, who tried to sound the alarm bells, were dismissed as sexual Nazis and theocrats by their confreres who wanted to party on in Castro Street's backroom bars and bathhouses, even though, as Shilts constantly reminds us, it meant almost certain death.<br /><br />Shilts has sent us a powerful message that we ignore at our peril. AIDS means that hedonists can expect to die sooner rather than later. The world's legions of drug shooting hookers will remain major amplifiers for AIDS, hepatitis and related illnesses as long as their addiction continues. So too will other marginalized and uneducated people. So too, of course, will people like Robert Gallo, who put his own narrow agenda ahead of humanity's.<br /><br />On the positive side, the book shows us that the villains are vastly outnumbered by the heroes, not the least of whom is Randy Shilts, who also finally succumbed to this great human calamity.virus and, Gallo excepted, the American ones, who followed up all the early clues that eventually led to the discovery of the medications that can now tackle the illness.

Just like Armenia, so also does Okinawa deserves something better.<br /><br />Okinawa's early history was pockmarked by a series of kings struggling to maintain control over fighting warlords. Although Shunten established his kingdom in the 13th Century by defeating his rivals, the entire island was not totally unified until a century later when Sho Hashi conquered the three kingdoms, which made up the island. Peace, of a sort, reigned until 1609, when the Shimazu clan from Satsuma, in southern Japan, invaded Okinawa.<br /><br />For the next 270 years, Okinawa was, in effect, a Satsuma colony. Satsuma demanded taxes from the Okinawans and controlled trade in exchange for island protection. Commodore Perry's black ships, as chapter seven explains, also paid an unwelcome visit during 1853 and 1854.  Perry, who established a small military base there, clearly had plans to bring the entire Ryukuyu Islands into the American ambit.<br /><br />Napoleon Bonaparte had similar plans. He regarded Okinawa as being central to France's vital interests. Anglo-Chinese tensions brought Okinawa further unwanted attention from both Britain and China. Because Britain, France and the United States were all making efforts to colonize the island chain, an increasingly apprehensive Japan tightened its grip on the island by sending a military detachment there in 1868. Later in 1879, Japan abolished the royal government and annexed Okinawa as a prefecture.<br /><br />Okinawa was then left in relative peace until 1944, when the Japanese Army arrived in force to counter the impending American attack. The Battle of Okinawa was one of World War II's longest, bloodiest and hardest fought campaigns. Total American casualties were 49,151, including 12,500 killed or missing in action. Japanese Imperial Army losses totaled over 75,000. Nearly one-third of Okinawa's civilian population-100,000 people-also perished during those nightmare months. The battle ended on June 22, 1945, when Old Glory fluttered unchallenged from Okinawa's mountains and towns.<br /><br />The Stars and Stripes have been flying there ever since. The area stayed under American military control until May 15, 1972, when Richard Nixon transferred administrative authority of the Ryukyu Islands back to Japan. The islands resumed the status they held prior to 1945 - the 47th prefecture of Japan.<br /><br />Ryukyu means Beautiful Country of the Southern Ocean. Like Armenia, it is indeed a beautiful and haunted land. However, just like Armenia, it is in an unfortunate position. Because it straddles the seaways between China and Japan and because it is near to Korea, the Spratly Islands and a host of other strategically important sites, it remains one of the most militarized places on earth. As the author makes plain, China and the Philippines periodically claim the island chain as their own. When we read the book, we see how truly unfortunate this is.<br /><br />Kerr paints the golden days of Okinawa before these outside pressures came to dominate the island. He describes how an impoverished people living on barren islands with no metals and little forest wealth were able to construct and preserve for many centuries a complex, progressive and stable government and society. Unlike some of the world's more endowed areas, the Okinawans, like the Armenians, had a toy state, with dignified kings, sententious and learned prime ministers, as well as an abundance of temples and shrines. Okinawa's whole fragile, minuscule structure was developed in a faithful effort to emulate great China, Asia's fabled Middle Kingdom.<br /><br />Although Kerr paints this beautiful experiment with enchantingly melancholic hues, he makes it plain that there can be no return to those golden days. Maybe withpeace pending on the Korean peninsula, a new and equally beautiful experiment in social engineering can begin. The people of Okinawa richly deserve it.en days. Maybe with peace pending on the Korean peninsula, a new and equally beautiful experiment in social engineering can begin.

Prof Werner was on Japanese TV and Japanese media and he argued his case very well in Japanese. He has studied the Japanese Central Bank for many years and of course Japanese Central Bank is copy of German Central Bank as everyone should know.<br />Look at the evidence. Japan is a poor country with no resources. How come it could fight the USA, China and many other countries all at the same time? How come Japan's GDP is bigger than the rest of Asia combined? How come Japan had the biggest financial collapse of all time when the Bubble Economy ended? Has the policy of the Central Bank something to do with it? Of course it has. Read Prof Werner's very detailed book to find out how central the Central Bank has been in Japan's success.<br />Here is another one everyone should know. At the height of the Bubble, Jpaan was worth more than the rest of the world combined. As Prof Werner explains, the Emperor's Palace could buy Canada. How come? Credit creation is the answer. The policy of the Central Bank gave so much credit everyone had money in Japan to buy what they wanted. That pushed up the prices. Then when the Central Bank wanted it to stop, they stopped it. But read Prof Werner's book to find out how credit creation works and how the Bank of Japan has used it for their own reasons. You need not agree with Prof Werner but if you are interested in Japan, you should read this excellent book.	2003-05-01
