The story of the Phantom of the Opera continues with Becky Meadows' Progency.  Seventeen years have passed since that fateful night at the Paris Opera House.  Christine Daae has married Raoul and they have a son, Christian.  Erik has been dead many years.  Or has he?? <br /> <br />There are so many twists and turns in this story.  My attention never wavered.  Secrets are slowly revealed.  Secrets that alter the future for everyone.  Has Christine finally made peace with her past?  Has she forgotten her Angel of Music or does his voice haunt her still?  What will Christian do once he discovers who his real father is?  And more importantly, is Erik really dead?  Or is he alive still living under the Paris Opera house? <br /> <br />This story blew me away.  I could not put it down.  I was so caught up in the emotion of the characters especially Erik and Christine.  The love they had for each other was eternal.  Even death could not destroy their love.  Near the end, one scene made me cry like a little girl! <br /> <br />I felt all of Erik's pain.  His deep despair and heart-wrenching grief over Christine's death.  I cried and longed to wipe those tears from his eyes, to give him some comfort before his anguish drove me mad.   <br /> <br />True love is eternal and there was no purer love than Erik and Christine's.  Death had no power over these lovers.  Nothing could keep them apart.  Deep under the opera house, their voices are heard, singing together in perfect harmony.  Together forever onto eternity.  How I cried . . . <br /> <br />I can't say enough about this story.  It was so well written, so filled with sorrow, rage, mystery and above all, a love that could not be denied.  For anyone who has fallen in love with the phantom, this book is for you. <br /> <br />Enjoy!	2005-03-01

That he is working on a secret assignment that no one, not even Eric, knows about.  The Queen of Louisiana who is Eric's superior.   <br /> <br />Bill warns her that if something happens to him, she must look in the secret hiding place that he built at her house for his computer and discs.  He tells her that she is to place herself under Eric's protection.  He leaves and poor Sookie is undeniably upset.  She can't figure out what is up with Bill. <br /> <br />Suddenly, he disappears.

It takes off where Dead Until Dark left off.  I loved it!! <br /> <br />Sookie Stackhouse has been blessed or cursed (some would say) with telepathy .  She can read minds at will so most people are leery of her.  In addition to her gift, her boyfriend, Bill, isn't your ordinary man.  He is undead - a vampire. <br /> <br />A co-worker of hers is murdered found dead in a detective's car.  Who put him there & more importantly who killed him?  On top of that, Sookie is viciously attacked one night by a maenad, a horrible creature that demands tribute from the local vampires.  Bill & some of the other vampires draw the poison out of her.  They save her life & she owes them.  They want Sookie to help find a missing vampire.  So Bill & Sookie are off to Dallas. <br /> <br />Book #2 is a roller coaster of a ride.  From the first page, the reader is drawn into Sookie world where vampires, shapeshifters & other supernatural creatures are larger than life.  They finally solve the mystery of her co-worker's death and have one final encounter with the maenad. I could not put this book down! <br /> <br />I eagerly wait to read more about the Viking vampire sheriff, Eric.  He lusts after Sookie.  He is patient, confident & extremely sexy.  Lucky Sookie.  :) <br /> <br />Highly recommended! <br /> <br />	2004-11-06

I have awaited this book with anticipation and dread.  I feared that this book would not measure up to the older ones that I felt were Christine's best.  Dark Melody was pure reading pleasure.<br />Dayan is lead guitarist for the Dark Troubadours.  His voice seduces and mesmerizes all who listens.  He is at a bar playing a melody that is dark and moody.  His hunger and overwhelming yearning are poured forth into his song for he is calling to her.  His lifemate.  He despertely needs to be saved for the darkness within is growing enormously strong.<br />Corrine Wentworth enters the bar and immediately changes Dayan's bleak world forever.  Yet, despite the fact that Corrie has telekenetic powers, she is pregnant and dying.  Dayan cannot risk saving her until her child is born for her heart is too weak.  At any moment, death could claim her.<br />Desperate to save her and himself from the darkness within, Dayan summons the rest of the healers together. <br />I loved reading about the reunion between Gregori and Darius. Gregori (my all time favorite) displayed awesome power as he tried to save Corrie and her child. It felt like the older Dark books where the all powerful males (Gregori, Mikhail, Jaques, etc.) joined together during times of peril.  How I missed reading about them!  I only wished that Mikhail was there. <br />This reader hopes that more reunions are planned for future Dark books. Those earlier Dark books have a special place on my bookshelf.	2003-11-04

Filled with mystery, chills and thrills ~ it was hard to put.  <br />In less than a 100 years, the Vampire Elite will control all of the world.  Sunshine, famous cinnamon baker at Charlie's Coffeehouse, has been kidnapped by vampires.  Forced to wear a red dress, she is chained to a wall in an abandoned ballroom.  But she is not alone.<br />Something immortal and hungry lurks in the shadows.  It is a powerful vampire, Constantine who has been chained by his sworn enemy.  He is half mad with hunger and having Sunshine so near to him nearly pushes him over the brink.<br />Yet, Sunshine is no mere mortal.  She is the daughter of a powerful sorcerer, Onyx Blaise.  Like her father, she possesses incredible powers that enable her to safe herself and Constantine.<br />Thus begins their journey for survival against those immortals who seek to kill her &amp; to finally get rid of Constantine.  <br />Sunshine was an incredible heroine.  Even before she realized that the magic she possessed as a young girl had grown powerful, she is determined to save Constantine.  Despite the danger he poses to herself, she will not leave him to die. She was so kind, compassionate and very courageous.  She was definitely a delight to read about.  <br />Constantine was an alpha male.  Powerful, graceful, handsome &amp; lethal.  The attraction between him &amp; Sunshine was believable unlike some other paranormal novels you might have read.<br />I hope that there is a sequel.  Onxy Blaise &amp; his mother are mentioned frequently.  Both have disappeared.  But are they gone for good?  I hope not.  It will be interesting to see Sunshine's reaction to her famous or infamous father. :)<br />Sunshine is an intense, vampire novel brimming with gothic undertones.  A must read for every vampire &amp; Anne Rice fan. <br />Highly recommended.	2003-10-14

He agrees only until the child is born.  Nine months later, he confronts Cyrus who tells him that the child has died.  <br />Yet, the child hasn't died and thus begins the Forest Lord's quest for vengeance.<br />Oh, I LOVED this story.  It was different and immediately snared my attention from the very first page.  I loved the Forest Lord.  He was very powerful, bent on revenge yet could not prevent feelings for Eden to resurface.<br />Eden was my kind of heroine.  She was strong yet had such a gentleness about her.  She was easy to identify withand a joy to read about.<br />BRAVO to Ms. Krinard.  The Forest Lord is an outstand lovestory and I pray she continues onward in this vein.	2003-10-09

Sebastian was a dragon slayer standing at six foot five, with long black hair and eyes a greenish-gold.  Wow ~ talk about mouth watering!<br />My favorite, though, was Karen Marie Moning's Into the Dreaming.  No, it wasn't Aedan MacKinnon which grabbed my attention.  Nope ~ it was the Unseelie King.  Wow! He just leapt off the pages and instantly DEMANDED my attention.  The power he possessed was enormous and terrifying.  He was so seductive and sinister as he cleverly set into motion a plan that even the Seelie Queen does not know about.  I had such a soft spot for those that are dark.  And there was no one darker than the Unseelie King.  I would love to read a novel solely about him.  <br />Enjoy.	2003-07-17

This novel has it all. Thrills, chills and romance abound!  Not to mention, that some of the dialogue had me laughing out loud.<br />Talon of Morrigantes had been orphaned at a young age.  Having to care for his little sister, he returns to the clan that had banished both of his parents.  Grudgingly, his Uncle takes him in and as he grows to manhood, he proves that he is a force to be reckoned with.  His temper and skill with a sword earn the clan's respect.  <br />His world changes when an enemy ambush catches his clan unaware.  His Uncle, Aunt, wife and son are killed.  Despite his overwhelming grief, he continues to lead the clan.  Turning on him, the clan kills his beloved sister before his very eyes and then him as well.  <br />Talon's terrible vengeance transcends time itself.  The Goddess Artemis offers him immortality and power for his service.  He readily agrees seeking vengeance against those who have wronged him.<br />He is now one of Artemis' Dark-Hunters.  And what a Dark-Hunter he is . . . . Tall, blond, dark-eyed and so very powerful.  He is clearly not one to mess with.<br />Sunshine Runningwolf enters his life quite unexpectedly.

Their attraction to each other is hotter than a firecracker on the Fourth of July!.  <G>  Yet, Talon & Sunshine have no idea that their meeting had been arranged. Dark forces are at work here.<br />Dionysus & Camulus seek to kill Acheron in order to reclaim their god status.  They are planning to release the Atlantean Destroyer and for this, they need Acheron's blood.<br/>Sherrilyn's characters are larger than life.  Not only are they powerful, they also possess a vulnerability that draws the reader into their world.  This quality makes them more identifiable and likeable.  <br />Zarek was so in need of comfort.  He had never known any kind of love.  His constant snarling & bad-butt behavior hid a lonely, aching heart.  I can hardly wait for his story.<br />My favorite, though, is Acherone.  He walks through life utterly alone seeking kindness in others but always finding cruelty.  He holds tremendous power (he is a god-killer) yet he is so very noble.  Even when confronted with is worst enemy, his brother, Styxx, he retains that nobility.  I fell sooooooo hard for him.  <br />Sorry ladies ~ I claim Acheron for my very own.  <G>  :)	2003-07-17

He is one of the legendary twins who was brought forth to our attention in Dark Legend as he played a cat &amp; mouse game with his twin (Gabriel), hoping to prevent him for turning to the dark side.  You see, long ago, a &quot;man&quot; unlike he had ever encountered, a man of peace and gentleness, told Lucian that there was a lifemate for his twin.  Cleverly, unselfishly, he sets upon a path that insures that his beloved twin will never turn vampire.<br />Ms. Feehan's adaption of Lucian was breathtaking.  He was extremely brilliant, powerful and very, very menacing.  Clearly, he was the strongest and most powerful of the Carpathians.  He had defended his people for endless centuries and his struggle with the dark side was evident from the start of DL.  This Carpathian was definitely an alpha male and one that I eagerly awaited to read about. <br />Onto the story:  Jaxxon Montgomery's young life has been spent in fear and in horror.  Her stepfather, Tyler Drake, a former SEAL, has killed anyone that has gotten close to her including her own parents &amp; foster parents.  He is clever, cunning and clearly deranged shaping Jaxx into a heroine who is determined to protect herself.  She becomes a cop forever knowing that her stepfather is out there waiting to strike again.<br />When her life is in peril, Lucian saves her and her partner. He brings her to his mansion desperate to heal her ~ to claim her.  He is clearly gentle, tender and their love senes are incredibly hot.  But . . .  (*Don't hate me here*)<br />For me, Lucian didn't seem as powerful as some of the other males (Mikhail, Gregori &amp; Darius). He seemed, well, rather mellow and that aura of menace that I thrilled to in Dark Legend was gone. I expected Lucian to be more like the males mentioned above.  Since he had existed for endless centuries without a lifemate, constantly battling the darkness, I thought that his aura of menace would be much more evident as it was inDL.  <br />Despite my crazy quirks, Dark Guardian was a good read.	2002-05-27

Ironically, a mysterious letter arrives from England.  Relatives that she has never known, invite her to come to their family castle.

They harbor a terrifying secret and will not let her leave the castle.<br />Despite her increasing fear she is drawn with an alarming degree of fascination to Kieran Ramsey.  He is lean, dark and so seductive.  He lures her using her own powerful desires.  Yet, Kieran is a man of secrets and deep longings that will not be denied.  And once unleashed, they could prove fatal to Selena's soul!<br />I devoured this book like a box of chocolates!! <G>  The sensual tension between Selena and Kieran kept me rivetted in the chair until I had finished the entire book.<br />Kieran was the type of hero I love to read about.  He was incredibly handsome, powerful and his sinful beauty drew Selena inspite of her growing fear.  She could not resist Kieran's sensual allure and neither could I!  What an alpha male!  <G><br />This is the one book that should NOT be passed up!

He has spent centuries upon centuries hunting his beloved twin, Lucian.  Long ago, both of them made a pledge to each other.  If one should turn, the other would hunt and destroy him.  After one ferocious battle, Gabriel locked Lucian deep within the earth.  Now, with the ground above them moving, all has changed.<br />He knows that he hasn't risen alone.  He feels the ground shift and knows that Lucian has awoken.  With a ferocious hunger to equal his own . . . <br />Gabriel is consumed with a fierce, unholy hunger.  He is so very close to turning and is consumed with the &quot;need&quot; to feed.  He encounters Francesca Del Ponce who is a gifted healer and harbors another secret.  She sees Gabriel, senses his incredible need and offers to help him.  An action which clearly takes him by surprise and seals her fate for all time!<br />I don't want to give anything away in Dark Legend but it is filled with incredibly written characters such as Skyler.  The young girl's pain and anguish was very tangible to the reader.  Hopefully, we can read more about her in another Dark book.  &lt;G&gt;<br />Anyhow, the deadly game between Gabriel and Lucian unravells until we (the reader) finally understand what the &quot;game&quot; was all about.  Lucian is introduced and boy, what another dark and dangerous Carpathian Christine has created!  :)<br />The unending loyalty and devotion that Gabriel feels for his twin was almost heartbreaking in its intensity.  He agonizes over fulfilling the vow he had made to him, agonizes over the fact that one day he would be forced to destroy him.   <br />The ending was incredible filled with the healing power of love and redemption!  I, for one, can hardly wait to read Dark Guardian.<br />Highly recommended!!	2002-01-18

This is the story of a vampire, Al, who falls in love with a mortal woman, Roshani.<br />The story developed very well, telling the tale of Al, the vampire and how he grew to accept his new existence.  That all changes once he sees Rosahni.  Even though, she is not an immortal, he can not prevent himself from falling in love with her.<br />That love leads to his ultimate downfall as he physically and mentally transformes himself into a human.  Such sacrifice depressed me entirely. . .<br />Everyone knows (especially if you read my other reviews) that I have a weak spot for vampires.  Not just for any old vampire but for the ones who are quite happy being immortal and who find a love strong enough to last throughout eternity.<br />Don't get me wrong, this story was NOT bad.  It was good but I would have preferred a different fate for Al and Roshni.  A million possibilities filtered through my mind as I ended the book.  Oh, why did it have to end in such a way??<br />What can I say, I am a helpless romantic for immortals!  :)	2002-01-05

BloodWind is book one of the WindDemon Trilogy written by Charlotte Boyett-Compo.  In one word, this book was Incredible!!!!!<br />Captain Kamerone Cree is the highest ranking officer in the Ministry of Acquisitions.  Since birth, he has been conditioned and trained to uphold the beliefs of the brutal Rysalian Empire.  He, along with six others, are known as Reapers.  All of them are extremely dangerous and possess the power to shapeshift into something very, very . . . lethal.  None of them are more dangerous than Kamerone Cree.<br />His savage/ruthless reputation causes men and women to flee from his presence.  No one dares to confront Kamerone, fearing his wrath.  He displays no emotion at all and is known as the Iceman.  Whatever he wants, he gets.  No questions asked.  Nothing is denied him until the Tribunal questions his loyalty and decides to make an example of him.<br />Why is his loyalty in question when it has never been before?  He believes he knows who is responsible.  The Resistance . . . <br />He is ordered to the Ministry of Behavioral Modification where he undergoes cruel and brutal treatments.  It is there that Dr. Bridget Dunne enters his life.<br />Bridget is young, beautiful and a member of the Resistance.  Along with her co-workers, she seeks to gain freedom from the Rysalian Empire and their only hope is to have Prime Reaper Kamerone Cree join their side.  Bridget never imagines the impact he will have in her life.  As he is forced to go through brutal reconditioning methods, her feelings for him begin to change.<br />Kamerone is the most deadliest of his kind.  A shapeshifting assassin that believes any emotion will leave him vulnerable.  Yet, he falls very, very HARD for Bridget.  He purchases her, forcing her to live with him. It is there that their feelings spiral out of control.<br />Unknown to these two, there are darker forces at work.  There are some who will stop at nothing to insure that their evil plans come to life.<br />Kamerone Cree was the ultimate, tortured hero. He was simply to die for . . . (sigh!)  He possessed such unimaginable power, a deadly force to be reckoned with if ever crossed yet he never harms Bridget.  One scene comes to mind (can't give anything away).  Bridget pushes Kamerone's emotions, willingly making him angry.  She expects him to hurt her yet he never does.  He touches her with gentleness and that soft caress is so very intimidating because it is in such contrast to the deadly fury roaring within him.  <br />Will Kamerone join the Resistance and what will he do once he discovers Bridget's part in all of it?<br />BloodWind was worth MORE than 5 stars!!  It is incredibly written. I, for one, eagerly await the continuation of Bridget and Kamerone's story in DarkWind.<br />Run and grab yourself a copy of BloodWind.  Prepare to fall in love with the deadliest of all shapeshifting assassins - Kamerone Cree.<br />Bravo, Charlee!	2001-11-01

US	49347235	R18XL5G1JS9NO7	1586979760	644343568	Nightwind	Books	5	2	2	N	N	An Unholy Love!!!	I had searched for a copy of this book for weeks.  I am soooooooo glad that I finally found a copy.  Nightwind is a chilling, incredible read but it is not for everyone.  <br />Lauren Fowler is in her forties, plain and somewhat mousey.  She has never known love, not from her parents or from anyone in the town in which she lives.  She has no friends and is somewhat tormented at work.  She is constantly overlooked and is utterly alone.  One night, her desolate cries of anguish are heard and are about to be answered. <br />Syntian Cree, a NightWind Demon, hears her cry.  It is different from all the rest and he centers in on it, instinctively knowing that Lauren is different.  She is meant to be his and his alone.  He rises out of Hell's own pit, bent on claiming her.<br />As soon as Lauren encounters Syn, life begins to change for her.  He is alluring and seductive.   With his charm and handsomeness, he easily sweeps the lonely Lauren off of her feet.  She cannot prevent herself from falling madly in love with him.  But there is a chilling side to Syn one which she does not see.  Bad things happen to those who hurt Lauren . . .  <br />This is an incredibly written story filled with love, sadness and betrayal. The ending totally left me stunned.<br />I would recommend this book to all who love paranormal romances.  If I could change one thing, though, it would be the ending.  No!  I won't give anything away but for me, Syntian Cree was the ideal &quot;dark&quot; hero. I know there are those out there who would totally disagree with me but I (like Lauren) grew to love Syntian Cree.  Despite his chilling wickedness, I didn't want his story to end in the manner in which it did.  Despite this, NightWind was an incredible, chilling read.<br />Highly Recommended!!	2001-10-11

All of the three sensual stories invite to you share in forbidden, sensual love.<br />Masquerade was written by Amanda Ashley a few years ago. Now it is included in this wonderful, exciting anthology. Jason Blackthorne is a very old vampire. For three hundred years, he has wandered the world alone. Now, he is very tired. Tired to exist only in the night. That is, until he sees a performance of Phantom of the Opera and Leanne. Her resemblance to his first and only love was uncanny, arousing forth emotions he had long thought dead. Dangerous emotions . . . Is Leanne strong enough to embrance the dark side of his existence or will the purity of her love free him for all eternity????? <br />The second story is Dark Dream written by the very hot Christine Feehan. This story deals with Falcon, a very old Carpthian who is sent out by Prince Vladimir (Mikhail's father) to become a guardian of the Carpathian people. Each of the choosen warriors willingly give up any chance at life. All give up on love, on happiness in order to insure that their people are kept safe. For many, many centuries Falcon has been utterly, totally alone. He has grown in power and in strength. He also knows that the beast in him is equalling strong, clawing for dominance. For this reason, he is headed back to his homeland wanting to see for himself his Prince (Mikhail) and his human lifemate who has been successfully converted. Before ending his existence, he longs to look upon something good and pure, longs for reassurance over the many, many kills he has made in his centuries of existence. Unexpectedly, he encounters Sara Marten who has &quot;seen&quot; Falcon in her dreams. She recognizes his handsome face right away, knows of his vulnerable and lonely soul. He is her Dark Angel . . . Her Dark Dream.<br />This story was incredibly, beautifully written. Falcon has an unwavering sense of loyality and devotion. Nothing or no one could ever prevent him from his duty to protect. He willingly sacrifices his new found happiness in order to fulfill his obligation. Christine has written another Carpathian to die for. Oh and an added bonus - several favorites make an appearance, too. EXTREMELY recommended!! I can't get enough of these Carpthians . . . :)<br />The third story is Ronda Thompson's Midnight Serenade. It is an incredible &quot;moving&quot; lovestory about a curse, werewolves and the redeeming quality of love. The characters were beautifully written. Their torment and longing for peace and love drew the reader into the story. Simply outstanding!! This story alone proves that love truly does conquer all. I couldn't put it down. Simply breathtaking. <br />So, fellow readers, if you seek to explore the dark side of love, RUN and grab yourself a copy and allow yourself to be swept away by the forbidden. ENJOY!	2001-09-22

Dark Fire is in one word, an EXCEPTIONAL READ!!  The talented Ms. Feehan has penned such an unbelievable lovestory.  She has bestowed onto her characters such emotion and depth that they become unforgetable and will remain in your thoughts long after the book is finished.  In fact, I didn't want Darius' and Tempest's lovestory to end.<br />Darius is the undisputed leader of this 'lost' band of Carpathians.  No one challenges his authority for he has kept them all safe for centuries.  He has never asked for anything in his long existence, content to be both ruler and protector.  He takes any threat to his family very personally and is much more savage than his older brother, Gregori.  He is a force to reckoned with, a formidable enemy. Now, he is very close to turning.  He has lived nearly a thousand years without any feeling or emotion. The only rush he gets is during a kill and that, in itself, is dangerous for it makes the beast within him more fierce.  He knows that with his incredible strength and power no one can defeat him if he should turn.  He would tear the world apart bringing death and destruction to the world.  Only his iron will and code of honor keep him hanging on.  Still, the darkness within him has been growing stronger and spreads across his soul.<br />Tempest 'Rusti' Trine reads the advertisement for a mechanic with a feeling that this job would be perfect for her.  Rusti is an unusual woman with a hidden gift.  Not only is she an excellant mechanic but she can also talk telepathically to animals.  This job seems almost too perfect for her.  That is, until she encounters Darius. In that instant, she senses the enormous power and ruthlessness which cling to him.  She is afraid wanting to run yet drawn to his incredible handsomeness and something she glimpses in his dark, dark eyes.    The moment Darius' black eyes rest upon her petite figure, he sees color.  They swarm his senses and bring forth powerful emotions that are dangerous in their intensity.  He is consumed with deadly urges unable to control the darkness within him.  He does something which he has vowed never to do and wipes the memory from her mind.  But Tempest is no ordinary human.  She remembers everything that has happened and in terror, she flees.  This, of course, makes Darius very, VERY angry.  The way he uses his powers to rescue her from danger is incredible!<br />I absolutely loved Darius.  He was so different from the other males of his race.  Yes, they all were very gentle with their lifemates and all were extremely protective of them, willing to kill for their safety.  But Darius' love for Tempest nearly scourched the pages of this book. The way he kept calling her &quot;Baby&quot; curled my toes . . .  He was so very tender and compassionate in the face of her fear. He put her welfare before his own, so very willing to sacrifice his own safety, his own life to insure her protection.  Unwilling to force Tempest to join his way of life, knowing of her rough past, he embraces the human way of life.  Something no other Carpathian has ever done . . . .   <br />In spite of this, Tempest is afraid that her love could never hold a man so powerful like Darius.  Only when Darius makes the ultimate sacrifice for her safety, does she realize how much she loves him and how hellish her life will become if she should lose him.  <br />Ah Lord (sigh) - such a passionate, unbelievable lovestory.  One I did not want to end. Thank you so Christine for such a powerful, utterly beautiful lovestory!!  :) <br />And for those of you who are wondering about Syndil and Barack, well . . .  their story reaches a wonderul conclusion, too.    VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!	2001-08-08

Master of Desire by Kinley MacGregor is a MASTERPIECE of a romance.  This talented writer has penned an incredible story filled with tragedy, humor and passion.  I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL STORY!!<br />Lady Emily has dreamt of finding love.  She desperately wants children and yearns to enjoy the joys that marriage has to offer.  She is the youngest daughter of an English lord who forbids her from having any freedom.  Nor is she allowed to leave her home.  So how can she find her knight in shining armour?  She is filled with growing despair until a mysterious stranger arrives at her father's estate.<br />Draven de Montague, the fourth earl of Ravenswood, is a proud warrior.  He is undefeated in battle and is the king's champion.  He is ordered by the king to take as a ward for one year, the daughter of his enemy.  He is aghast at this decree for no woman has entered into his estate for many, many years.  He is afraid that the curse will strike if a woman once again resides there at his estate.  Every woman who has lived at Ravenswood falls victim to the rage of their lord.  Draven acknowledges the rage inside of him and is afraid of losing control.<br />Emily soon discovers that there is much more to Draven than fierceness and a terrifying reputation.  She sees beneath the hard exterior to the man beneath.  A man who will not allow himself to believe in love.  A lonely man who does not consider himself worthy.  She catches glimpses of his goodness and pain deep within and soon becomes captivated.<br />Despite the fact that Draven has vowed before the king not to harm or touch Emily, she pursues him with unshakeable tenacity.  He has never broken his word.  His honor is everything to him but then again, he has never encountered someone like Emily.<br />She was a great heroine!  I loved her unwavering determination to make Draven fall in love with her.  Nothing or no one would sway her once she had made up her mind to have Draven.  It was a nice change tosee the woman do the pursuing instead of the man.  Combined with her beauty, courage and gentleness, Emily was so funny.  She had me laughing along with her.  <br />Draven was the ideal hero.  Powerful, handsome and so tortured over his brutal past and the dark legacy bequeathed onto him.  Dare he believe in Emily's gentleness and love?  Or will the curse resurface and destroy what is left of his soul?<br />Toss in an unknown villain who is bent on having these two families go to war, hot passion, soul stirring tenderness ad side hugging laughter and you have got a MASTERPIECE.	2001-08-06

The scenes were so realistic, I was drawn into their world.  Not too mention all of the other supernatural creatures that wait in the shadows!<br />This story wasn't so much of a lovestory.  Oh, there was romance between Nikki and Michael but it didn't overtake the story.  Both of them have secrets they are keeping from each other.

She waitresses at Merlotte's Bar and leads a pretty quite but happy life.  Yet, Sookie isn't your ordinary waitress.  She has telepathic abilities which enables her to hear the thoughts of other people.  This makes it pretty hard for her to have any kind of social life. She almost never has a date despite the fact that she is very pretty with blond hair and blue eyes.  Mostly everyone thinks she is crazy.<br />For years, she has wanted to meet a vampire.  One night, quite unexpectedly, she does . . .<br />Bill is a Civil War-era vampire.  He is the &quot;man&quot; of her dreams.  He is tall, handsome and mysterious.  More importantly, she cannot hear his thoughts.  She is estatic to find that there is only silence and tranquility when her mind merges to his.

Immediately, he realizes that Sookie is different from other humans.  He cannot use his vampire power on her.  She is indifferent to his power.  In all of his centuries he has existed, Bill has never come in contact with a human who could resist his power.  He is intrigued.<br />Suddenly, one of Sookie's co-workers is killed.  Someone in Bon Temps is killing young women and making it look as though it is the work of a vampire.  Teeth marks are found on the victim's thighs.

She was pretty, smart, courageous and so very funny.  Some of the things she said had me laughing out loud!  Bill wasn't your typical bloodsucker running wild in search of &quot;food&quot;.

This is my revised review for Dark Challenge.<br />Dark Challenge is the fifth book in the Dark series.  The story centers on Julian Savage, twin brother to Aidan.  He is close to turning, believing that there is no hope for him.  He is harboring a terrible secret and has willingly distanced himself from his own race and even his twin.  He is determined to keep those he loves safe from harm and seek his own death.  He wants to die an honorable death. <br />The great healer and hunter, Gregori, knows this and sends Julian on a mission hoping to save him.  He is ordered to warn a group of performers that they are in danger.  In so doing, he finds his lifemate, Daria.  But Daria is no ordinary female.  She is Carpathian and has powers of her own.  She is attracted to Julian and afraid, too.  Nothing like this has ever happened to her or the group that she is travelling with.  Enter - Darius. <br />He is the formidable leader of this group of missing Carpathians. From that very first page, he took over and cast Julian WAY into the shadows.  His torment as he wrestled with the darkness was much more evident that Julian's. I felt the  desperation he had as the beast within him roared for release.  He would make a very formidable enemy for he is RAW power.  <br />I'm not going to give anything away here but there are a few surprises in store for the reader!!  There are also the other members of the group that are very interesting.  No doubt, their stories will be available in the near future.<br />Dark Challenge is filled with sensual love scenes, humor, sadness and of course, Darius.  Poor Julian never had a chance once such a dynamic Carpathian entered the fold.  Nevertheless, I recommend it highly for the reader will get an insight into Darius' struggle with the darkness.	2001-05-23

The ending is a little different then what some might expect.<br />Louis Redman has lived for centuries as a vampire.  He has loved twice during his long existence and has lost both of his mortal brides.  He has longed to become human again.  Longs to live the life of a mortal and experience all of the wonders of being human . . <br />Scientist Stacey Kimball is ambitious, inquisitive and seeks to unlock the door to immortality.  There is a serial killer stalking the Seattle night.  The victims are left with strange marks upon their neck and all have suffered from severe blood loss.  There is talk of a vampire and one name is linked to the killings.  Millionaire Louis Redman.<br />Stacey is very interested in his blood chemistry and is determined to seek him out.  She does meet him and is instantly, powerfully attracted to his unimaginable handsomeness.  She tries to deny her attraction believing him to be the killer, the vampire, who is stalking the night.<br />Even though he longs for human contact with an almost unbearable thirst, Louis will not allow himself to fall in love with Stacey.  He is desperate to prevent himself from going through the pain of losing another mortal love.  The way he had with Arabella and Cassie.  His attraction for her grows despite his will to remain unemotional.  Stacey is lovely, smart and courageous making Louis' longing for human contact that much more agonizing.<br />Stacey discovers that Louis Redman and Louis Rodmini are one and the same.  She confronts him with what she knows, demanding in return for her silence, his blood. She wants to study him and to find a cure to wipe out every disease known to man.  He is immediately interested believing that with her help, he can become mortal again. <br />All is not as it seems, though.  An unknown evil stalks every shadowy corner.  Someone or something wants Stacey dead.  Could it be Louis?  Or perhaps someone from the agency where she works?<br />This story was very good.  Don't get me wrong.  It contained suspense, danger and intrigue but . . . something was missing.  Some might disagree with me here but I found Louis' desire to become mortal a definite disappointment.  I know it is my opinion but I LOVE a vampire who LOVES being a vampire.  I just can't identify with a vampire who longs to become mortal.  All of that preternatual power and sensuality was wasted.  I couldn't help but sigh with regret over it all!!	2001-05-15

This, of course, he doesn't realize until much later on.<br />The story was very good up until this point.  The interaction between Talon and Regan crackled with attraction and a good amount of chemistry. As the story moved on, Regan's defiance and rebellion over her kidnapping grew tedious.  I might get a lot of criticism over this review but for me, Regan quickly became tiresome.  Incredibly, Talon's love for her never wavered.<br />The rating above is solely for Talon.  He was the epitome of a pirate.  Ruthless, dangerous and menacing.  For the life of me, I couldn't quite figure out why he was so attracted to Regan especially when she repeatedly tried to harm him??  Her constant betrayals disgusted me and changed a potentially excellant novel into an OK one.<br />Talon would have been better off feeding Regan to the fishes!	2001-05-15

The purity of her voice awakens all of his tortured emotions.  Utterly mad with wanting her, he devises any and all means necessary to lure her into his world. A world filled with despair, anguish and madness. . .<br />This story is absolutely haunting.  It filled me with such sadness that Erik believed himself so unworthy.

I read this book at least a dozen times and really enjoyed it.  The time period is 1842 and it was a pretty violent time for women.  Especially beautiful women like Lady Catherine Aldley.  She is heading home from Portugal when her ship is suddenly attacked by pirates.  Pirate Captain Jonathan Hale takes one look at blonde Catherine's radiant beauty and claims her for his very own.  But Catherine isn't your typical captive.  She is headstrong, spoiled and unwilling to become any pirate's play-thing.  She fights him at every turn changing his lust into something more powerful.  He carries her off to the pirate island of Las Palmas where their desire and love for each other bloom.  Troubled times await the lovers as their paradise hideaway is attacked and the pirate captain is taken captive.  Island Flame was a very good story.  Very accurate for the times.  Beautiful women were at the mercy of powerful men and there is no man more powerful than pirate Captain Jon Hale.  Pirates took what they wanted without any remorse and Jon Hale is no exception. He is consumed with lust for the beautiful Catherine.  He wants her with a fierceness that astounds him and he does take her.  Yet, Catherine's spirit and beauty prove deadly to him.  She proves to be more than a mere passing fancy as she effortless melts his icy heart.  Give Island Flame a chance.  You will not be disappointed.	2001-01-13

This story is set in the 1920's, the Jazz Age.  The main character of this book is Frederica Lavoy who is the granddaughter of Louis Radman from Midnight  Kiss.  Frederica is blessed with unique gifts.  She is different from the  other vampires for she is able to walk in the sunlight.  Her father,  Marchand LaValois, along with others of his kind, hold trials of those  vampires who endanger their way of life.  They act as judge, jury and  executioner only to those who are truly evil, who slaughter innocent  humans.  Frederica works for him, hunting and bring them to face justice.   Strange deaths are reported and all evidence seems to point to Eduard  D'Arcy.  Frederica is sent out to bring Eduard in to face her father's  justice.  But is Eduard innocent or guilty?  Mortal or immortal?  As her  feeling for him grow, she begins to have doubts that he is the killer who  is terrorizing the humans.  And she begins to doubt whether or not she will  be able to bring him forth for justice.  But more is at stake than her own  conflicting emotions.  An old enemy resurfaces manipulating both Frederica  and Eduard in a quest for vengeance.  This book was good but in no way does  it compare with her previous book, Midnight Enchantment.  Perhaps I found  Frederica too ruthless, too unfeminine.  I had hoped her edge of hardness  would soften.  She was simply not appealing to me.  The developing love  story between Eduard and Frederica would have been more compelling if  Frederica didn't have that hardness.  I know some will disagree with me  over this because she is a hunter but I really prefer a heroine to be  feminine and well, sweeter.  Someone easier to identify with.	2000-07-28

I am an absolute fanatic over that bad boy Gregori.  I have BURNED for this book since April.  DARK MAGIC is the fourth book in the Carpathian series written by top notch author, Christine Feehan.  For nearly a  thousand years Gregori, the relentless hunter of the undead and the most  powerful of the Carpathians has struggled with the darkness.  He is  teetering on the brink of madness.  The beast within him strong.  He can  wait no longer and seeks out his lifemate.  Savannah Dubrinsky, daughter of  the Prince of the Carpathians (Mikhail &amp; Raven) is a world famous  magician.  More than anything she desires her own independence and does not  want to be a lifemate to anyone.  Especially to one as powerful and  menacing as Gregori.  She runs from him.  From his dark sensuality and the  intensity of her feelings for him.  Years before, he came to claim her as  his lifemate.  Right away she notices how very different Gregori is from  the other young men.  He is much more powerful and very, very frightening.  As his cold silver eyes glided over her, she feels an awakening within her  body as if something wild within her longs for him.  He speaks to her mind  that she BELONGS to him and no one else.  With a kiss that scourches her  soul, her fate for all time is sealed.  Savannah's life changes in that  very instant.  She fears not only the total control Gregori would have over  her but also the intensity of her feelings.  In desperation, she pleads  with him to give her her freedom.  Very reluctantly, he agrees giving her  five years.  But in the waiting there is much danger.  Now the vow he has  made to her is at an end and so is his control.  He is very close to  turning and is now unable to seek the dawn to kill himself.  He knows how  incredibly powerful he is.  Knows that there is no one who could defeat  him.  Not Mikhail or even Aidan could hope to destroy him.  He knows that  if he should turn vampire, he would tear the world apart. Gregori can no  longer trust himself and seizes Savannah.  But it is too late.  Having her  presence near him sends him toppling over the edge.  The struggle between  man and beast is AWESOME and totally believable in one who has struggled  with insurmountable darkness for endless centuries.  Savannah merges her  mind with his and &quot;feels&quot; the suffering he has endured for her.  For the first time, she understands Gregori's plight.  The five years of  freedom he had given her had been so very horrible for him to endure.  She  is consumed with guilt for it is her fear and young age that have brought  so powerful a man to such a pitiful, horrible state.  She reaches out to  him despite her fear, offering herself to him.  That acceptance slowly  allows the man to gain control over the beast.  DARK MAGIC is brimming with  dark emotions, incredible sensuality and violence.  All of us who have read  the very first book in the series knows that Gregori is a hard man.  He has  suffered more than any other Carpathian for he is called upon to dispense  justice and all of that killing has taken its toll.  His own people fear  him and the immense power he possesses.  Knowing this, he willingly  isolates himself even though he is aching for acceptance.  He believes his  soul is forever lost and in a desperate bid for salvation, he tampers with  nature.  He agonizes over Savannah one day discovering how he had  manipulated their chemistry many years before.  Agonizes that there very  well might be her &quot;true&quot; lifemate waiting for her.  Agonizes that  her heart will never be his!  DARK MAGIC is definitely a KEEPER.  Christine, girl, you did an OUTSTANDING job with my bad boy's story.  THANK  YOU!  Carolynust himself and seizes Savannah.  But it is too late.  Having her  presence near him sends him toppling over the edge.  The struggle between  man and beast is AWESOME and totally believable in one who has struggled  with insurmountable darkness for endless centuries.  Savannah merges her  mind with his and &quot;feels&quot; the suffering he has endured for her.   For the first time, she understands Gregori's plight.  The five years of  freedom he had given her had been so very horrible for him to endure.  She  is consumed with guilt for it is her fear and young age that have brought  so powerful a man to such a pitiful, horrible state.  She reaches out to  him despite her fear, offering herself to him.  That acceptance slowly  allows the man to gain control over the beast.
