A man named Carl is attacked on the train while trying to defend a woman from some thugs and put into a coma for his efforts.  He awakens after an unspecified amount of time and is released to find people around him behaving very strangely.  He arrives at places without remembering the journey.  He is surprised to find himself in bed with his secretary.  All kinds of things just seem a little off. <br /> <br />Was Carl injured more seriously than the doctors realized?  Has he become amnesiac?  THE COMA is a fascinating exploration into existence, reality, dreams, consciousness and identity.  It is a quick read, but a thought-provoking one.  Some may find it slight, but after the two bloated, overlong novels I had read just prior to this one, I found it a relief.  Garland says more in two hundred liberally-spaced pages than the others did in five hundred, and says it better.  Woodcut illustrations by the author's father add to its surreal quality.  I can't stop thinking about it.  Highly recommended.	2005-07-24

High-powered executive James, who suffers from an unknown chronic illness, his French wife Sabine, their two children Beth and Jessie, James' secretary Rachel, with whom he has had an affair sometime in the past, James' longtime friend Matt, who was employed by James until he was ostensibly made redundant, and Matt's wife Chrissie, whose open sexuality tends to make people uncomfortable.  The story centers around Jessie, the precocious, disturbed eleven year-old who is being secretly tutored in forbidden knowledge by a mysterious instructor.  Jessie becomes the catalyst for increased tensions and rapidly fraying relationships among the adults, all of whom have secrets from one another.  The approaching storm in the title takes on more than one meaning... <br /> <br />It's hard to put a label on this book.  Though there are a couple very frightening sequences and a lot of suspense, it's not horror.  Nor does dark fantasy seem appropriate.  Magical realism?  Perhaps.  There are some events of questionable reality, but whether they are literal or psychological aberrations is open to debate.  What it most certainly is is a fascinating relationship drama involving some extraordinarily well-realized characters, and a dark-edged mystery.  The story itself is brilliantly constructed almost in a puzzle-like fashion.  The background of Jessie's instructor is told in a parallel narrative to the main story, until it all comes full circle at the end, evoking a kind of symmetry.  Novels rarely come as perfect as this.  I can't say enough about Graham Joyce.  This is the third consecutive novel I've read of his and they just get better. <br /> <br />This Night Shade Books edition is signed and limited to 1000 copies.	2005-06-21

A mother and her two sons have abducted a small boy for ransom, but what they actually got was something far worse.  The creature opens their minds to the stories that follow: <br /> <br />\\"Underworld\\" - a man finds his dead wife haunting an abandoned building, and she gives him something special to bring back to this world. <br /> <br />\\"White Chapel\\" - a journalist tracks down a killer who has gone underground in India and become a perverse kind of saint. <br /> <br />\\"O Rare and Most Exquisite\\" - an old man tells the story of the time he met a mysterious woman who had a way with flowers... <br /> <br />\\"Only Connect\\" - a young man suffers a strange identity crisis. <br /> <br />\\"The Fruit of Her Womb\\" - a retired couple discovers the frightening history of their new home, and the dark secret of the fields beyond. <br /> <br />\\"The Rendering Man\\" - a young girl's encounter with a bizarre neighbor shapes her life in disturbing ways. <br /> <br />\\"The Night Before Alec Got Married\\" is the account of a bachelor party gone horribly wrong. <br /> <br />\\"The Ripening Sweetness of the Late Afternoon\\" - a small-town celebrity returns home to find it has been visited by a holy scourge. <br /> <br />\\"Chosen\\" - predators stalk their prey in a New York apartment building. <br /> <br />\\"The Little Mermaid\\" - a woman's beach injury leaves her vulnerable to a madman. <br /> <br />\\"Damned If You Do\\" - a man takes his mother's wisdom all the wrong way as he indulges in his own idea of caretaking. <br /> <br />\\"The Hurting Season\\" - an unfortunate stranger stumbles upon the twisted rituals of a family of southern Baptists.   <br /> <br />\\"I Am Infinite: I Contain Multitudes\\" - an inmate in a hospital for the criminally insane gets one chance for escape. <br /> <br />Three of these stories appeared in Year's Best anthologies, but almost all of them are very good.I didn't think the framing story was necessary; it has no bearing on the individual stories and drops out of sight till the end after the first few anyway.  I'm not sure why the author chose to use this particular device at all.  In any case, this is an anthology worth picking up.  There are several gems.	2005-06-06
US	52138947	R3EN38QU0EDWU0	0786016434	918996457	Hot Blood	Books	4	9	10	N	N	Hot and bloody indeed...and bloody good	This is the first entry in the successful erotic horror series, now reprinted with better cover art.  I've read three of these so far (out of order) and this is the best one.    Here's an idea of what you'll find:    In Graham Masterton's \\"Changeling,\\" a traveling businessman falls for a mysterious, irresistible woman, and then finds out what life is like from her perspective.  It has some interesting developments, but at times reads like a feminist tract on how hard it is to be a woman.  Fortunately it gets back away from that and redeems itself in the end.    In Richard Matheson's \\"The Likeness of Julie,\\" a college student finds himself fixated on one of his classmates, without knowing why.  The infatuation turns darker when he's unable to shut out thoughts of all the things he'd like to do to her.    \\"The Thang\\" by Robert R. McCammon is about a man with a small personal problem.  It wants to be funny but is simply grotesque and cartoonish.  It's the only story in this collection that's actually bad.    A gardener and a housekeeper carry on an affair as they care for a hideously crippled old woman in \\"Mnage a Trois\\" by F. Paul Wilson.  But their employer is not as helpless as she seems.    \\"Mr. Right\\" by Richard Christian Matheson portrays a session between a woman and her therapist.  Like most short-shorts, it reads like an extended joke with a punch line, but the author plays nicely with the readers' preconceptions about doctor/patient roles.  You'll want to kick yourself for being taken in by it, but you'll enjoy it all the same.    Lucid dreaming takes a deadly turn in Chet Williamson's \\"Blood Night.\\"    The protagonist of Mick Garris' \\"Chocolate\\" finds himself inexplicably experiencing the desires, feelings and finally the actions of a woman he's never met before.    Ramsey Campbell's \\"Again\\" finds a man trying to help a lost old woman, and the horrors he encounters after he succeeds.  This is easily the most frightening story in the book, which surprised mebecause I've always found Campbell's work very dull.  Apparently there's an exception to everything.  The quality of the stories here, as good as most of them already were, steps up a notch with this one.    A young woman arrives to spend some time with her aunt and meets her strange young companion in Lisa Tuttle's \\"Bug House.\\"  It's a chilling examination of predator/prey relationships.    A couple of thugs assault a helpless married couple in Theodore Sturgeon's \\"Vengeance Is.\\"  But which party is really the more dangerous?    A more subtle kind of revenge is at the heart of \\"The Unkindest Cut\\" by J. N. Williamson.    A man his haunted by the girl he mistreated twenty years ago in Michael Garrett's \\"Reunion.\\"    In \\"Footsteps\\" by Harlan Ellison, a child of the night meets her match in a fast-talking Frenchman, and receives the shock of her eternal life.    A sorority girl is obsessed with a very foreign classmate in Mike Newton's \\"Pretty Is...\\"    Gary Brandner's \\"Aunt Edith\\" is a witch who would just love to put her niece's new boyfriend to the test.    Dennis Etchison once again proves himself to be one of the masters of quiet horror with \\"Daughter of the Golden West,\\" as two best friends investigate another's disappearance and strange death.    \\"Meat Market\\" by John Skipp and Craig Spector gives the term literal meaning as we witness a violent courtship ritual.    Rex Miller's entry gives a radio DJ a chance to finally meet a special woman he's known only as \\"The Voice.\\"    We discover the disturbing truth behind the fashion industry in Robert Bloch's \\"The Model.\\"    A man balances two very dysfunctional relationships in Steve Rasnic Tem's \\"Carnal House,\\" which blurs the line between being dead and being alive in both directions.    \\"They're Coming For You\\" by Les Daniels is another comedic tale, but unlike the McCammon entry, is actually funny.  It begins when a man comes home to find his wife with another lover, and runs from there.    \\"Suzie Sucks\\" is themessage scrawled on the wall in editor Jeff Gelb's story.  Is it really just a tasteless practical joke?    In Ray Garton's \\"Punishments,\\" a church organist strikes up a special relationship with the teenaged boy she sees there every week.  This is both the most erotic and the most disturbing story here.    Finally, in David J. Schow's sad and frightening \\"Red Light,\\" a model photographer learns that we cannot give of ourselves indefinitely.  This story won a World Fantasy Award, and deserved it.    The best entries here are by Schow, Tem, Etchison and Tuttle, but most of the rest are worth reading as well.  I think the best stories are the ones that have sex as a plot point (that is, after all, the theme) but don't focus on it constantly.  It's not that I'm a prude by any means; I just find it keeps things from getting repetitive and predictable, and allows for a broader variety of content.  I always start every anthology hoping to read just one priceless gem.  There are many here.	2005-06-01
US	52138947	R3FLFZWMMJMJ3Y	0812571452	662098422	Finity	Books	3	1	1	N	N	One world is not enough	FINITY takes place in the year 2062, in a world where the Axis powers won World War II.  Most of the world is divided up into reichs, with just a few remote free zones, such as the New Zealand expatriate community to which professor Lyle Peripart belongs.  One day Lyle is contacted by the extraordinarily wealthy industrialist Geoffrey Iphwin to work within his company.  The offer is too good to refuse.   <br /> <br />Then strange things begin to happen.   <br /> <br />Lyle starts noticing unexplained inconsistencies in the automated logs.  People around him, including his fianc, are replaced at seemingly random times with identical duplicates who have different memories and skills.   <br /> <br />The other mystery involves the disappearance of the United States of America.  Not physically, but perceptually - no one can recall ever speaking to anyone within its borders.  Even thinking about the place is difficult.  For all intents and purposes, it has ceased to exist. <br /> <br />FINITY deals with alternate realities - a concept which has fascinated me since I read Madeleine L'Engle's A SWIFTLY TILTING PLANET in elementary school - and quantum theory.  The book gets off to a ponderously slow start.  There is a lot of scientific and mathematical mumbo-jumbo to wade through right at the beginning, and a considerable amount of scene-setting which is, frankly, annoying.  (Everything in this world - vehicles, houses, etc. - is completely automated and outfitted with something akin to Douglas Adams' \\"genuine people personalities.\\")  Things do clear up eventually, though both the reader and the characters are kept in the dark for a good two thirds of the story, after which it suddenly becomes a non-stop action adventure.   <br /> <br />The biggest flaw of the novel for me was the flatness of the characters.  There's a good sized cast, but put together they don't have half the personality of Melpomene Murray, the central heroine in Barnes' ORBITAL RESONANCE.  If I didn't know better, I'd think the books were by different authors; the style is that different.  The pacing is also something of a problem.  The solution to the mystery is revealed literally in the final few pages, so the ending feels rushed. <br /> <br />It's an alright book that could have been much better.  I recommend seeking out Frederik Pohl's THE COMING OF THE QUANTUM CATS, which is a stronger, better developed exploration of these themes.	2005-05-31

Channel 400 is constantly trying to top themselves in an effort to keep from losing viewers, and they believe they've found the next big thing in The Doctor - televising his adventures as a live reality show.<br /><br />The plot doesn't end there, however.  Hiding in the shadows is a hideous race of dying creatures knows as the Fleshsmiths, and they want The Doctor for their own reasons.<br /><br />Mike Tucker co-wrote one of my favorite new Doctor Who novels, `Illegal Alien,' so I had high expectations for his first solo run.  I came out from it a little disappointed.  It's a rather run-of-the-mill adventure, with typical characters, typical villains, and a typical story.  Romance begins to develop for Ace, but she gets her heart broken - again.  (Inevitable, I suppose, but predictable.)  It just all feels a bit formulaic.  There is a gratuitous epilogue that I thought was unnecessarily grim - even more so if it's not followed up on in later novels.<br /><br />To the author's credit, the characters from the show are handled very well, though it's too bad that The Doctor and Ace are separated most of the time.  The self-referential concept of turning the Doctor into a television serial is amusing.  And there is a nice surprise about halfway through.  It's not a bad book, but it's not great either.	2005-04-24

Sam Altman meets Lindy as a student at Berkley and realizes almost immediately that they are soul mates.  Before long, they move in together, leaving their friends behind.  Sam becomes obsessed with the Dall sheep that live in Alaska's mountainous wilds, identifying with them to the point that he engages in serious role-playing to discover his true heart.  He takes LSD to aid him in reaching this other state of mind.  Eventually he spends all his time in this state, convinced he has connected with a primal god he calls Animus.    I've seen an amazing amount of hatred directed at this book.  I've seen it described as misogynistic and offensive to women.  (What isn't, these days?)  I guess only women are allowed to search for (and find) enlightenment.  If you are that threatened by the thought of a man doing the same, take your issues to a therapist rather than transposing them onto a piece of fiction.  Apart from that, you can't expect characters in a story to behave the way you want them to.  If you want something that fits into a cozy, acceptable mold, find something with Oprah's sticker on it.    This is a heady novel and obviously not for everyone.  At times it is difficult to get through, and I did find the hallucinatory passages tiresome as they increased in frequency.  It's not a perfect book; the characters are fairly two-dimensional.  But it's not really about them.  Shapero writes beautifully and with first-hand knowledge about nature and the northern landscape.  It's an interesting experiment that the adventurous will find rewarding.	2005-02-03
US	52138947	R384Y6BTCBR5WO	084394658X	753181731	The 37th Mandala	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Spirits in the sky	Marc Laidlaw has chosen an unusual subject matter for this novel: mandalas - astral creatures that feed on human pain.  A spiritualist named Elias Mooney discovered them and shared their existence with Derek Crowe, an entrepreneur whom he trusts.  But Crowe is more interested in making money off the phenomena, and he twists Mooney's writings into palatable new age drivel, generating a cultish religion and gaining celebrity for himself.  He doesn't truly believe in his mentor's teachings, until two young followers are all too successful in breaking the barrier between the planes and come to him, desperately seeking help. <br /> <br />THE 37TH MANDALA is a well-written drama about meddling with greater powers but it never really becomes as involving as it could have.  After a powerful prologue, the story settles into a typical adventure with typical characters.  The mandalas themselves, though nicely depicted, are never really frightening and actually become less interesting as the story progresses.  The importance of the number 37 is stressed at the very start of the book (which, amusingly, contains 37 chapters) and the significance of the title mandala is strongly hinted at, as if generating some kind of build-up.  Yet later on this idea is abandoned, as it seems everyone has a mandala of their own - and that's something we have seen before.  (John Shirley's WETBONES comes to mind.)   <br /> <br />It's a decent novel, and most people will probably enjoy it, but I had higher expectations.	2005-01-16

It's because it's garbage.  You think you've read some stinkers from the \\"major labels\\"?  You haven't seen anything. <br /> <br />POISONING EROS is the story of Gloria, an aging, washed-up porn star with artificial parts and a wicked drug addiction.  In order to feed her habits she's been reduced to starring in increasingly extreme internet-distributed bestiality videos.  Then one day a mysterious man offers her more money than she could ever imagine - but she has to work for him only.  The consequences for breaking her contract would be terrible indeed. <br /> <br />It doesn't take a genius to work out that this guy's a demon in disguise.  What he puts Gloria through makes her previous encounters seem positively mundane by comparison. <br /> <br />This is yet another half-baked extreme horror story where the authors take a paper-thin plot and characters, and simply throw in everything but the kitchen sink in an effort to disgust the reader.  However, the only thing I found shocking was that something so inept ever got printed.  I weep for the trees. <br /> <br />What's especially sad is that it took two people to write something this bad.  In fact it might have been better had it been a solo effort (but only slightly.)  There are several instances where it seems like the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing.  There's a scene where Gloria realizes the true nature of some creatures she's been \\"working with.\\"  Later in the book, she makes the same realization.  The age of Gloria's daughter seems to fluctuate, and pieces of prose are repeated word for word at different points.  Clearly no one bothered to proofread the final product.  Meanwhile, some poor unemployed editor is out there starving. <br /> <br />The ending of the story is so sickeningly sweet that if the rest of the book didn't makeyou nauseous, that will. <br /> <br />I could go on, but then my review would be longer than the book itself.  At least if you choose to read this, you'll only have wasted an hour or two.	2005-01-09

Most have a supernatural element, while some are more psychological, but almost all have a darker edge to them.      A lonely dwarf finds a personal use for the mirrors in a carnival funhouse, until someone makes a cruel practical joke out of it.  A man becomes obsessed with the bones beneath his skin.  A new mother is convinced that her child is trying to kill her.  A poor family inherits a farmland and a terrible duty as well.  An obstinate old woman simply refuses to die.  A neurotic man fears the wind.      With all the modern horror I read I find it refreshing to pick up Mr. Bradbury's work from time to time and travel back to a quieter, simpler era, and this anthology satisfies.  The stories are no less chilling for being over fifty years old.  If you like tales in the vein of 'The Twilight Zone' this is just the sort of thing you will like.    This edition contains an introduction by the author in which he talks about the origins of some of the stories, and illustrations by Joe Mugnaini.	2004-10-23

A major American publisher has received samples of a new work by India's greatest poet, M. Das.   What makes this exceptional is that M. Das is believed to have died several years earlier.  So poet and small press publisher Robert Luczak is sent on an all expense paid flight to Calcutta to investigate, and discover whether it is somehow true or an elaborate literary hoax.  But Luczak will find this is anything but a free ride.  His curiosity will cost him dearly in other, less material ways.    The back cover of the Tor reissue of this novel builds the story up a great deal, indeed perhaps beyond the ability of any author to deliver.  Is it, in fact, the most chilling, shocking thing I've ever read?  Did it strike me through with fear like nothing else has before?  Well, no.  However, it does contain some very chilling moments, a whole lot of solid suspense, and a final, major shock near its conclusion - all contained within quality writing.  If it has any flaw, it's that it leaves a lot of questions never answered.  More realistic, particularly since we are experiencing the story from one character's perspective, but it leaves one wanting, nonetheless.      But never mind.  The journey is the thing, and it's still a powerful story worth reading.  It is also interesting for its philosophical content.  Just don't let the marketing hype raise your expectations to outrageous levels.  One thing it doesn't lie about: you probably won't forget it.	2004-09-27

One fateful day she finally gets fed up with the worst kid in the school and crosses the line in dealing with him.  Facing the almost certain loss of her job and probably legal action as well, she decides to run.  She isn't that happy with her life, anyway.  She takes with her an eight year-old girl named Mistie, whom everybody knows is being abused at home.  Kate knows people, and plans to take Mistie someplace far away where she can grow up safely. <br /> <br />It isn't the most well thought out plan, and control is taken out of Kate's hands almost immediately anyway by a bitter, cruel teenaged girl named Tony.  Tony is running also - from a botched convenience store holdup and also from her deadbeat mother and pathetic home life.  She intends to go to Texas where her wealthy, connected father can give her the life she feels she deserves.  Kate's road trip to salvation suddenly takes a sharp u-turn into hell. <br /> <br />While a lesser writer would have piled on horror after horror out of pure sadism, Massie provides a story in which there is much cruelty, but never any without reason.  Intense but not to gratuitous excess, it rises above the crop of horror novels that seek only to disgust the reader.  She also keeps her antagonist from becoming a cartoon villain by telling one third of the story from her perspective.  Tony commits horrific acts and while you certainly never like her, you actually do feel for her.  She is a product of her environment as much as anyone else, and she has intriguing psychological motivations for her behavior.  This, too, sets it apart from more common works. <br /> <br />This is a fast-paced, compulsively readable thriller about life on the dark side of the Mason-Dixon Line.	2004-09-14

Unfortunately, freedom from the mass-market also means that anything can get published, regardless of quality.  Maybe it's about connections; editor Kelly Laymon is the daughter of late horror novelist Richard Laymon.  It is clear his case of arrested development has been passed on.  The inspiration for this collection was the Gross-Out Contest at the annual World Horror Convention, where authors gather to read their most repulsive work, with activities to match.  Indeed, this is the most disgusting set of tales I've ever passed my eyes over.  It is filled with graphic violence, bodily fluids, and deviant behavior of all kinds.    This would be fine if the stories themselves were any good.    'Excitable Boys' contains the most amateurish writing I've ever read in a so-called professional publication.  It sounds like a bunch of little boys (and one girl) sitting around a campfire trying to outdo one another.  The writing is consistently stiled - here's an example: \\"Jack gasped and took the glass desperately, pouring the entire amount of pure, crystal-clear water into himself.\\"  The stories are more or less extended jokes, and predictable ones at that; some even come complete with a punch line.  The content is revolting, but it fails to be disturbing because it's so utterly cartoonish.    Even the illustrations look like something a kid in junior high school would have come up with.  They're not too bad -- assuming the artist is under the age of twelve.    In case you're curious, here's what you'll find within: a ridiculously extreme case of child abuse, a discredited doctor forced to act as a tool of revenge for the mob, a monster made of excrement, a radioactive escaped convict, zombie sex, two guys making a snuff film, and a mercifully brief piece about a cannibal trying to go to the bathroom (Yes, this apparently qualifies as a story.)  The best I can say about thisjuvenile garbage is that it is a quick read.  Nothing in here should have ever seen the light of day, or been put on paper to begin with.	2004-08-07

Nine year-old Anna Wheaton finds herself there when she's knocked into a coma by a sledding accident. Deedee Blaine's consciousness is helplessly spirited away whenever she has an orgasm, which understandably distresses her partners (few of which call her back afterwards.) And for Vietnam vet Kevin Lucier, &quot;jumping&quot; is the only way he can escape being confined to his wheelchair. When Anna's parents are killed during a botched hospital robbery, she vows revenge. But even more dangerous than the criminals she's stalking is the Shadow Monster, a malevolent, near-omnipotent being that inhabits that other realm, and which taunts them with their own hidden secrets.  <br />  <br /> Despite the concept, there's nothing transcendental about this story, which reminded me of the works of Dean Koontz. Three very different individuals with a common bond come together against an evil force. Part supernatural horror story, part thriller, nothing terribly original. The writing is adequate; Gates isn't what you would call a stylist. The sex scenes are particularly clumsy, eliciting laughter more than anything else. On the other hand, there are some nice scenes of creative violence. A quick read, but not a particularly satisfying one. JUMPERS gets my average &quot;beach reading&quot; rating of three stars.	2004-07-22

That's when they hear about a place called Valhalla, a run-down but still awe-inspiring mansion built by a notorious gambler named Jack Belias in the late 1920s. Craig immediately becomes obsessed with the place, and purchases it against Effie's wishes. He begins to change, becoming irrational and eventually violent and abusive. Effie finds herself more in danger of losing her husband than ever, and in ways more permanent than she could have imagined.<br />For a large portion of this novel I was somewhat disappointed, as it comes off as a standard haunted house story, with all the usual accoutrements. A very well-written one, but a standard one nonetheless. As it turns out, there is more to it than that (the phenomena the characters experience aren't what we normally think of as haunting, though the author offers it as a plausible explanation of such) but it doesn't fully surface until a good two thirds of the way in. Is it worth pressing on through overly familiar territory to get to that point? I think so. You simply have to trust Masterton - who is one of the best writers in the genre - to deliver. If you're new to the horror field, this is a good place to start. But for a better, fresher and far more frightening story about a &quot;special&quot; house, check out his Lovecraftian novel PREY.	2004-07-20

Her features are slightly equine, and she has a horn growing from her forehead.  They name her Acorna and raise her as their own.  Unfortunately, they have trouble keeping her under wraps, and they find themselves having to prevent her from falling into the hands of everyone from the scientists who want to study her, to a &quot;collector&quot; with an interest in rare creatures.  <br />Taking refuge on the planet Kezdet, they make the acquaintance of a wealthy businessman of Chinese descent, who recognizes Acorna as the Kirin of ancient mythology.  He is on a mission to end Kezdet's underground child slave trade, and when Acorna gets involved, she makes her most dangerous enemies yet.<br />I used to be a huge McCaffrey fan, and I've read a considerable portion of her work, including much of the Pern series, The Ireta Adventure, the Crystal Singer trilogy, and the original Ship and Pegasus novels.  I've moved away from her work in recent years, but the beautiful cover on this one drew me in (Ignore the cheap CG background.)  While not abysmal like Crystal Line was, Acorna is definitely one of her weaker efforts.  The characters don't have much depth - the title character least of all - and any personality traits they are given are repeated to the point of cliché.  (I lost count of how many times one character &quot;blushed the color of his beard.&quot;)  The story itself isn't particularly gripping.  The confrontation with the book's chief villain towards the end is hugely anticlimactic.  Even the reality of child slavery is watered down, though the thematic cries of &quot;the children, the children!&quot; did grow wearisome.  This is safe SF, basically a comfort read.  If you like a little edge in your reading, you may be bored, as I was at times.  I didn't dislike it entirely, but it is highly unlikely that I will read the next bookin the series.  A mediocre effort from an author who is, perhaps, past her prime.<br />Note: While there is no cliffhanger ending, and while the major conflicts are resolved by the last page, there are several threads left open for exploration in the books that follow.  I am content to depart from the series after this first installment, but be aware that the overall story is not truly complete.	2004-07-08
US	52138947	R1R52TZRECYAAZ	006028644X	377135331	Wasteland	Books	3	16	19	N	N	A wisp of a book	This is the third book I've read by this author.  One of the things I admire about her work is the way she writes about sensitive issues while completely avoiding any kind of reactionary attitude.  This particular story involves a subject which, while entirely consensual, carries a heavy societal taboo.  The matter of fact way in which it is handled is refreshing.<br />Siblings Marina and Lex have always been very close, so close that they have always had trouble finding interest in any others.  One night things go too far and shortly afterward Lex takes his own life.  Marina is left to deal with the loss of the only person who ever really mattered to her.<br />I've enjoyed Block's novels in the past, although they tend to evaporate from memory soon after I close them.  'Wasteland' was even more ethereal, seeming insubstantial even as I was reading it.  Much of the story is told by Marina, as if she were speaking to her brother, reminiscing about the times they had together, and far too much of it is rambling, directionless, and inconsequential, and tedious to read through.  There are a couple subplots generated but never followed through.  Only a revelation at the end gives the book any impact.  A mild disappointment.	2004-06-27

Like Charles Grant, Etchison's strength lies on the quiet end of that spectrum.  Events in the stories will often seem perfectly normal, even mundane, but bits creep in gradually until the reader realizes that things are not as they should be.<br />Some highlights:<br />&quot;When They Gave Us Memory&quot; - An actor returns to his hometown to find things have changed...but were they ever the same?  <br />&quot;Deadtime Story&quot; - A teenager receives a threatening phone call while at work.  Will he make it home alive?<br />&quot;Call Home&quot; - A man learns that being a Good Samaritan can be a very bad idea.<br />&quot;A Wind From The South&quot; - A woman has an unexpected visitor who seems harmless at first, until she begins to notice pieces of her life disappearing from her grasp.<br />&quot;The Detailer&quot; - A car wash attendant makes a startling discovery about one of his clients.<br />These are tales that would have made Alfred Hitchcock or Rod Serling proud.  I recommend this collection if you appreciate more subtle discomforts, and know that being unsettled can often touch deeper than outright shock.	2004-06-27

This particular book is an assortment of stories dealing with sex and horror.<br />In \\"Hungry Skin\\" by Lucy Taylor, a young woman finds there is more than meets the eye in her late, estranged father's erotic artworks, and eventually finds herself in them as well.  A man desiring revenge on his ex-wife finds an opportunity in the form of a young prostitute with a familiar face in Harry Crews' deliciously cruel \\"Becky Lives.\\"  Love and devotion among freaks is examined in Wayne Allan Sallee's \\"Lover Doll.\\"  Dan Simmons takes us to frightening foreign lands in the chilling \\"Dying in Bangkok.\\"  A traveling student learns the power of memory in Stephen Dedman's \\"The Lady of Situations.\\"  And Clive Barker revisits a world from his novel 'The Great and Secret Show' as two rogues are enlisted to rescue a man from the dream-sea, in the very funny \\"On Amen's Shore.\\"  (One need not have read the novel to understand or enjoy this story.)  <br />There are also memorable pieces from Pat Cadigan (another very funny story), Jack Womack, Nicholas Royle and Kathe Koja.<br />Only a few are a bit weak.  Richard Christian Matheson's entry, like most short-shorts, is unsatisfying, while Joyce Carol Oates' and Joel Lane's are relatively pointless exercises.  <br />Overall, a good variety of styles and content is represented here - subtle or explicit, from earthy suspense to happenings of a more surreal nature.  There's probably something here for everyone.  This is an exceptional collection worth looking for.	2004-06-16

In the title story, Mikage has just been left alone in the world after the passing of her grandmother, who was her last living relative.  She is generously taken in by an acquaintance, a boy named Yuichi who knew her grandmother, and his transsexual mother Eriko.  Eriko lets her stay for free as long as she promises to cook for them from time to time, and the three of them build a new family of sorts.  Eventually, though, Mikage finds herself confronted with another tragedy.<br />The second story is called &quot;Moonlight Shadow.&quot;  Satsuki has lost a boyfriend in a car crash which also claimed the life of his younger brother's girlfriend.  One day she meets a mysterious woman with a secret she wants to share.  This story has a slight element of fantasy to it, a touching piece of magical realism.<br />The author has a deceptively simple style of writing which enables her to deal with weighty issues without them feeling oppressive.  These works are deeply affecting, but they are poetic rather than doom-laden.  I preferred the second story, which is tighter and has a definite resolution, whereas the first is more of a slice of life and though longer, felt a little incomplete.  As always, I enjoyed the look at Japanese daily life.	2004-06-05

It is in a public restroom that she is confronted by Russell Gavin, an old high school acquaintance but not a friend.  Russell is a Christian.  He believes that Leila's affliction - indeed, all the misfortunes in her life - are punishment for the darkness that resides in her soul.  He wants to save her, and to this end he kidnaps her, takes her to a remote location and keeps her captive and bound, bringing her out only to attend religious services with others of his kind.  He also withholds the treatments she needs to keep her eyes from getting worse.  (If she will only accept Jesus into her life, she will be healed.)<br />This is a pretty straightforward thriller from a writer whose work usually possesses far more depth, complexity and uniqueness.  Characterization is good but the plot is simple: Leila must escape and get help before her vision deteriorates completely.  The ending is sudden and somewhat unsatisfying.<br />I can mildly recommend this novel for fans of psychological thrillers, or if you're just looking for a quick, relatively unchallenging read.  For true horror gems, though, I suggest seeking out the author's first three novels: Prodigal, Wilding, and Revenant, all of which were published in the early to mid-nineties under Dell's Abyss imprint.  They are fantastic.  This and most of her work since has been something of a disappointment.	2004-05-08
US	52138947	R2QG8WVMDCQ0XV	044021338X	605053016	65MM	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Celluloid horrors	Joe Moreson has always wanted to own a movie theater, one where he could screen and share his favorite classics.  So when the opportunity presents itself, he finally decides he's had it with his current job and takes the plunge.  He picks up and moves to Fareland, one of those small towns where everyone knows each other.  But the Fareland Theatre is doing much more than enabling Joe to fulfill his dreams.  He has suddenly become erratic and malevolent, detached from his wife, and perhaps from reality itself.<br />Having read Hoover's first, the very original psychological horror novel Shadow Twin (also published by Dell Abyss), I was expecting something very fresh and different.  But 65mm is basically just another presentation of horror story standards: the small town with a dark secret, a lurking evil force, and increasing insanity leading to a broken marriage.  The setting of the theater is just that; it isn't really relevant.  The story itself is unsatisfying and seems like it was aborted at too early a stage.  The individual parts don't gel.  A significant character is killed, but it never has any bearing on the rest of the story, least of all on the character to whom this person is most important.  Murders are uncovered with a mysterious message, but we never find out what it means.  And the evil force at the heart of it all is hardly defined.  It's fine to keep a mystery, but at least give the reader something.  It's just sloppy.<br />65mm is a surprising disappointment.  It isn't a terrible book, but it will probably seem too familiar to most readers.  By all means seek out the author's first novel, but give this one a pass.	2004-04-08

Isserly herself is a small woman of indeterminate origin, slightly strange-looking but also strangely attractive.  Of each man she picks up, she wonders: will he be missed?  <br />That is all you need to know - all you should know - of the story.  It is full of surprises, from the first sharp shock about twenty pages in, until literally the very last page.  Faber skillfully places hints - an unfamiliar word here, an incongruous physical description there - without the reader even being aware that it is happening until later, when more is revealed.  The gradual build of information grips the reader like nothing else.  Suffice it to say the story is about a woman with a job to do, and what happens when her faith in her profession is shaken.  It is also about humanity's place in the scheme of things.  <br />Leave your expectations at the door..or enjoy watching them crumble.	2004-03-27

All three involve a writer as the main character, presumably Lee's alter ego.<br />In the first story, \\"Goddess of the New Dark Age,\\" a cancer-stricken author is literally haunted by his life's failures.  He consults people of various stripes - a priest, a professor, a call girl - in an attempt to answer the question \\"what is real?\\"  <br />The second story, \\"The Seeker,\\" is essentially a rehash of the first, with added gore and the revolting acts that Lee is infamous for.  It is perhaps meant for those who couldn't hold their attention on the previous story.<br />In the final story, \\"Pay Me,\\" a writer visits a sex club and encounters an acquaintance he carried a torch for in high school.  He soon finds she has changed in unspeakable ways.  Lee tries to add weight to the story by telling us (in his afterword) that it is a philosophical tale.  It's really just a soulless piece of pornography, and the inexplicable ending seems like a lame attempt to root it in the horror genre.<br />The first story is recommended.  It is deep and surreal and the only well-written piece of the three, and earns this publication three stars.  The others aren't worth the time it took to read them.	2004-03-13

Nonviolently but effectively embarrassing these companies into submission, he's naturally made some enemies in high places.  S.T.'s latest intended conquest, in an effort to cover up some egregious mistakes, has released something dangerous and untested into Boston's waters.  They know S.T. is close to uncovering their secret, and they don't intend to get caught out.<br />I liked the main character, who was highly motivated in his work but not sentimental about it.  He's not a bleeding heart, but someone who is concerned about the big picture.  There is no preaching here, only science.  While there is a lot of technical information, the conversational, humorous tone keeps it from turning into dull lectures.  S.T. would have made a good teacher.  Assuming the science is sound, I actually learned a lot in my reading.<br />The book is fascinating and funny mystery up until the last third or so, when it jumps the contaminated shark, so to speak.  A close ally becomes a betrayer without explanation (and later returns as a friend, no questions asked.)  A man who has shown no previous signs of erratic behavior goes mad, not without reason, but it seems too sudden.  I thought I had somehow missed a large section while reading.  The story never quite recovers from this radical shift.  Still, it is a very enjoyable and educational book for the most part, and one which should appeal to technothriller fans as well as science fiction readers.	2004-02-24

People everywhere lie broken and bloody in their beds, as if assaulted by some unseen, deadly force.  A handful of survivors find themselves fighting against a wild world whose mutations have ceased to follow any kind of normal evolutionary path.  At the center of it all is Blane, a man with no memory of his past, a man who has always felt most at home in the forest but now finds it has rejected him; and Fay, a mad force of nature bound in human form and bent on hideous revenge.<br />It may seem like just another end-of-the-world story (or is it a beginning?) at first but Lebbon looks at the situations on a deeply personal level and takes them in surprising directions.  It is very much a character driven story.  You will care about these people -- even the bad ones.	2004-01-13

It feeds on anger and unrest, and to this end employs a punk rock band to tour across England's countryside, inciting hatred and violence in the guise of hideous and literal class warfare.  <br />RAGS isn't much of a DOCTOR WHO adventure.  The characters from the show (Jo Grant, The Brigadier, and the men of UNIT) barely make an appearance until the final third of the book, and the Doctor himself least of all.  Furthermore, his characterization did not evoke the third Doctor - or any Doctor - for me.  He does and says very little, and at those times seems out of character.<br />The story itself is very slow and the situations remain pretty constant from start to finish with little progression in between.  If I hadn't been counting the pages, I'd have been surprised I was two hundred pages in when I was.  On the plus side, the author does take time to develop his supporting cast into more than just the usual throwaways.  But their back stories never quite gain relevance in regard to the main plot.  Capped off with an unsatisfying finale, this isn't an adventure I would particularly recommend.	2004-01-02

His wife Lexy has fallen from a tree in the backyard and died.  How and why this happened is unknown; the only witness to the event was their dog, Lorelei.  Desperate to make sense of what happened, Paul - a linguist by profession - sets about trying to teach Lorelei to communicate what she saw that day.  A long shot to say the least -- even Paul's colleagues are laughing behind his back when they get wind of his project.  But the author succeeds in making the reader believe it might be possible.  <br />In addition, Paul notices certain incongruities about the house.  Are they clues left behind by his late wife, or is his grief causing him to embark on a wild goose chase?<br />The story begins in a surprisingly humorous vein but takes a much darker, even horrific turn about two thirds of the way through, and as such reminded me very much of Amanda Filipacchi's excellent novels.  They also share a significant element of wordplay.  This is a book which should please mystery fans and language enthusiasts alike.	2003-12-21

After a bad breakup, a woman begins suffering blackouts in which she sees a famous comedian gesturing curiously at her.  A young man discovers new pleasures after a fateful visit to an obscure thrift shop.  A woman learns of her fiancé's disturbing obsession with a girl long dead.  A grade school principal carries on an extramarital affair with one of his teachers.  An innocent game between lovers goes horribly awry.<br />Each piece is like brief snapshot of someone's life.  They don't always have a beginning or an end and don't need to.  They are funny and melancholy at the same time, and the characters feel like people you know or might know.  If you need to have a strong, driving direction to your literature, you might be disappointed or even bored.  If, on the other hand, you enjoy small glimpses into the lives of others, while perhaps learning something about yourself, this might be for you.	2003-12-07

It is the year 2025, TV is truly the opiate of the people, and society is divided sharply between the haves and the have-nots.  Ben Richards' family is in the latter group.  He's been unfairly blacklisted and his wife has had to resort to hooking to pay the bills.  Meanwhile, his baby daughter lies ill with the flu - perfectly treatable if only they could afford it.  Desperate and at the end of his rope, Richards opts to participate in a game show called &quot;The Running Man.&quot;  He is to become the quarry in a deadly hunt that will last no more than thirty days.  For each day he successfully evades his pursuers, his family earns a large sum of money.<br />No one has ever lasted more than eight days.<br />The games network, of course, hardly plays fair.  The rules require Ben to periodically mail in videos, thereby running the risk of giving his location away.  And rewards are given for any information leading to his apprehension, so Richards is also playing against a bored and bloodthirsty public -- in other words, everyone.  The ongoing hunt is very suspenseful, but it's when Richards finally confronts his true nemesis that things get really interesting.<br />As I was reading I couldn't help thinking that this story was ready-made for film.  It moves along at a rapid pace, especially once the game is underway.  It's not simplistic, but neither is it complicated enough that it should require much tampering.  (I've not yet seen the movie, but from what I have heard they somehow dropped the ball.  Too bad.)<br />The concept of reality TV probably seemed outrageous or at least far-fetched in 1982, when The Running Man first appeared.  Now it seems disturbingly prescient.  Though the book belongs in the science fiction genre, it is more frightening than many of his horror stories.  One warning about this edition: the story is prefaced by an introduction lifted from the earlier Bachman Books publication, and for some reason King gives away the ending in it.  Maybe it's an editing oversight.  In any case, save it until you've read the book.  It will allow you a more powerful reading experience.	2003-11-16

It isn't one of Ellison's themed anthologies, so the content is varied.<br />The book opens with one of his most well-known stories, \\"Jeffty is Five.\\"  It concerns a child who not only stops aging, but who exists in a kind of temporal stasis with regards to his perception of the world.  In other words, the world as it was continues on as such, even though it has moved into the future for everyone else.  I found it to be largely an exercise in nostalgia.  <br />\\"How's the Night Life on Cissalda?\\" is an uncharacteristically silly story about sexually voracious aliens.  It is outrageous, hilarious, and merciless in its satire.<br />\\"Would You Do It For A Penny?\\" is a fascinating study of an expert manipulator who plies his psychological trade on vulnerable women.<br />A radio call-in show becomes a medium for spreading demonic gospel.  An man's thirst to right a wrong alters the reality of others, while another's builds gradually, rising to the surface and emerging as a murderous personality, many years later.  A man who has wasted his life finds himself in a limbo specially reserved for such sinners.  All the women in a man's life return to him one by one, leading to an inevitable and terrifying confrontation.  A woman desperately searches for escape from the world.  A man who has always given of himself at last learns to take what he needs to truly live.  A writer learns that a person's death does not always free you from him.  And we finally find out what the deal is with those odd magical curio shops that always turn up in fantasy fiction.<br />The title story, and the last in this collection, is about a man who finds himself split in two and helpless as his other self gradually takes over his life.  I still remember this as the premiere episode of the 1980s Twilight Zone series.<br />Preceding each entryis an introduction in which Ellison talks about the inspirations and circumstances that led to its creation.  While these are always interesting, occasionally they give a little too much away, making parts of some stories seem contrived.  Many of them would have been more appropriate as afterwords.  I actually would suggest reading the stories first in most cases.	2003-11-05

It wasn't groundbreaking, but it was solid and well-written and I enjoyed it enough to keep.  I was expecting at least the same level of quality from BEDBUGS, his collection of short work.  I was disappointed.<br />If you've ever regularly watched any horror or suspense anthology show, or picked up an EC comic, you've probably come across most of these stories before.  A mysterious woman in a carnival sideshow irrevocably changes the men who fall under her spell.  A poorly covered up murder gradually reveals itself.  A man switches places with another whom he has accidentally killed.  Hunters get their just desserts when one of them goes missing.  A man makes a deal with the devil that naturally comes back to bite him, but only because of his own stupidity; the reader realizes the catch long before he does.  In fact, nearly all of these stories are so familiar that I guessed the outcome from the first or second page.  Sometimes the story is purely a set-up for a punch line (and a pun) involving its title, such as \\"...From a Stone,\\" \\"Master Tape,\\" \\"Closing the Doors,\\" and \\"Served Cold,\\" which only makes it more obvious.  I let out a very audible groan upon finishing every one.<br />There were just a few entries that weren't so tired.  \\"Karen's Eyes\\" concerns spectral remnants of the dead that just won't go away.  \\"Perfect Witness\\" offers a disturbing idea of how murder cases might be handled in the future.  \\"Worst Fears\\" effectively blurs the lines between life and death for two close friends.  However, none of these is worth going through the whole book for.<br />If I'm ever inclined to pick up another of Mr. Hautala's books, it will likely bear the name of A. J. Matthews, under which he wrote the aforementioned novel.  It's almost as if they aren't the same person at all.	2003-10-14

As a result, he looks a few years younger than he is.  One night he discovers that his homeroom teacher is an alien sent to Earth to study humans.  Through a series of misadventures and misunderstandings, Kei ends up having to marry her.  This of course only complicates things more...<br />It's a silly story but not a very interesting one.  Reading this, I got the feeling I'd seen it all before.  It's true that a lot of manga and anime repeats themes to the point of cliché, but some of it has the charm to overcome that.  This one doesn't.  The art is serviceable; probably what most people would call a typical manga style.  It's just an average product overall.  <br />ONEGAI TEACHER is published in the original Japanese right-to-left format, making it annoying to read for English-speaking audiences.  A few publishers have been doing this and I still haven't gotten used to it.  To make it worse, the lettering isn't always consistent, so that even if you have successfully retrained yourself, you'll still run into trouble in spots.  The story is recommended for ages 13 and up, which is over-cautious in my opinion.<br />While I hate to leave any story unfinished, I don't see myself purchasing the second volume.  If I saw it in a library, I might pick it up, though.  Recommended only for die-hard manga fans who read absolutely everything.	2003-09-21

Over fifty years later, that village remains under military occupation, closely guarded from prying eyes.  One reporter manages to sneak in and get some footage on video.  The disturbing contents of the tape draw the attention of UNIT, and its retired former head, Brigadier Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart.  <br />Meanwhile, an associate is investigating the secret meetings of an elite supremacist group -- meetings that are being attended by someone who looks an awful lot like Adolf Hitler.  <br />The Brigadier, of course, summons an associate best equipped to deal with strange and impossible occurrences.  The three of them begin to uncover a mystery involving trapped aliens and the intended rise of a new world order...<br />In contrast to a previously read adventure written by Justin Richards, this one is quite enjoyable.  While at times it feels like two separate stories were imperfectly merged into one, for the most part it works pretty well.  The main plot builds on unsolved mysteries surrounding the outcome of the war (historically based, but with a certain amount of artistic license) and it is interesting to see how the pieces fit together as the novel progresses.  This is always one of the fun things about historical time travel stories.<br />The characters from the show are faithfully portrayed.  The Doctor's sixth incarnation retains his trademark arrogance, yet is sympathetic when need be.  And while his mannerisms are a bit more subtle than say, the fourth Doctor's, the authors are observant in including them at the right times.  Likewise the Brigadier.  It is easy to picture the television actors when reading both roles.  Claire, the reporter, is intelligent, resourceful and useful, like too few of the show's companions.<br />Apparently this novel was put together and rushed out in a shorter time than is normally given.  Even so, it's one of the better new adventures I've read.	2003-07-05

Beginning at the end of the nineteenth century, it follows one extended family on through the next hundred or so years through a series of loosely connected vignettes.  (You may want to draw up a family tree when you start, to help keep track of relations.)  The title refers to a character that occasionally appears to offer advice or suggestions to certain family members at relevant times.  Sometimes it is a stranger on the street, sometimes a friend or associate.  <br />But with the exception of a tragic event that occurs at the story's end, this entity's words seem to have little or no effect.  Episodes go by without any intervention at all.  One wonders whether his/her presence was even necessary.<br />As always, Melanie Tem's keen understanding of psychology and human interrelations shines.  There just isn't a substantial plot beneath it.<br />The other thing worth mentioning is that this book is not horror.  There is one hallucinatory segment that would place it in the genre, but it seems incongruous.  It is otherwise a straight family history; why it is labeled a horror novel, and a \\"terrifying\\" one at that, is something I don't understand.  Lazy marketing, I suppose.  In any case, those looking for such a thing will likely be disappointed, while those who do normally enjoy reading these kinds of stories will probably miss out on it entirely.	2003-06-28

Having left her hometown and severed all contact with her past after being raped by her stepfather years ago, she is suddenly called back now after one of her old friends has been murdered.  One by one, others once close to her die in unexplainable ways.  She feels her Dark Man getting closer even as an unearthly power within her threatens to emerge.<br />Just when it seems that the only things people write about anymore are vampires, Jacobs gives us a fresh subject (or at least one you don't see very often): Mexican death gods.  Her writing has a flowing, literary quality that possesses a strange kind of beauty even as she describes sickening acts.  It vividly depicts a surreal nightmare of a realm called Xibalba, where demons routinely torture unfortunate souls in sacrifice to higher powers.  But unlike many of the current crop of horror authors, there is far more to her story than graphic violence.<br />The fact that it is so well-written and original makes the final act that much more disappointing.  It is all but incoherent.  The fate of the story's primary antagonist is also unsatisfying.  It is indicated from the start that he is someone who knows Leslie, but apart from him being a servant of dark gods, no motive is revealed.  And when we do learn his identity, it is done in such a casual way that you could miss it if you aren't paying attention.  <br />Despite the letdown at the end, the novel is still good enough to recommend.  If you're tired of the same old retreads, this should satisfy on most levels.  I'm eager to read whatever she comes out with next.	2003-06-08

That is, until a creature called Lysistratus -- a psychic vampire who feeds on dreams -- is attracted by the vivid nature of Cat's and steals them away.  She may lose more than a source of income as a result.<br />YARROW's story is scattered among a cast that is larger than it needs to be, giving background on those characters that has little relevance, and generating subplots that never come to fruition, while the book's antagonist goes sadly underdeveloped.  As a result, events that are important have little impact.  The story doesn't really get off the ground until the final few chapters and even then, barely so.  In the end, nothing particularly interesting happens.  This isn't just a light read; it's hardly there at all.	2003-05-09
US	52138947	R3K5DTRVEVGJCI	1565049217	892284862	The Hope	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Voyage of the damned	The Hope is a massive ocean liner the size of a small city, that was funded by an eccentric philanthropist who killed himself shortly after its completion.  It launched in spite of this bad omen, and now thirty-some years later has become a degenerate microcosm of society, with still no destination in sight.  The story is composed of a series of vignettes, not necessarily complete in their own right, but which interweave and combine to form a greater scene.  The ship's chief engineer tells a far-fetched story of deadly, unnatural vermin that infest the ship's inner workings.  A teenaged drug addict finds her salvation through a kindly old woman with a special smile.  A man is convinced that the ship is trying to kill his wife.  A jaded misanthrope tends a haunted library.  Turf wars erupt, passengers declare war on their neighbors, and the poor struggle to feed their children.  Grim on the face of it but filled with black humor, it's nearly as funny as it is bleak.  But when the deceptively simple yet chilling secret of the Hope is finally revealed, the irony in the name of the ship will become clear, and the despair you'll feel for the crew and passengers trapped on its endless voyage will be very, very real.  A modern gothic classic worth seeking out.	2003-04-19

Ace, venturing off on her own, is sold into servitude herself, and the Doctor finds himself a reluctant messiah to the exploited underclass as he tries to find and rescue her.<br />Most of the narrative switches back and forth between political goings-on among the society's dignitaries, or the rebels' interminable wanderings in the desert, neither of which is particularly interesting.  The Doctor is portrayed as some kind of superman, bending the barrels of shotguns in half and displaying immunity to anything the bad guys might throw at him.  While his race does possess abilities and resistance beyond those of humans, this is a bit much.  There is very little of the Doctor we know in personality either; indeed, there's very little of his character at all.  Likewise Ace, who spends almost the entire time in a drug induced haze, which is a shame because the bits where she is in her own mind are the only relatively enjoyable segments.  <br />In addition to being dull, this novel is written in such a way that anyone over the age of twelve or so is going to feel they're being talked down to.  However, I wouldn't recommend it to any age.  If you're craving an adventure that features the seventh Doctor and Ace, there are far better ones out there.	2003-04-14

Feeding her unlikely stories of an organization that deals in human slaves, they lock her up in their basement and torment her for the remainder of her pregnancy.  <br />The plot is thin even for a 140-page novella.  Beyond the initial abduction and imprisonment, the drama never escalates, and so it grows tiresome.  The story might have actually been more interesting had it been expanded into a longer form, and shown us what is going on elsewhere as the woman's lover and family try to find her.  But unfortunately the author doesn't concern himself with any of that.<br />The story's other major flaw is how inept the villains are.  At one point they go so far as to reveal their full names, in an attempt to set up a safety net that would never work.  And though the wife is a nurse, she doesn't seem to be aware that what they're doing can very likely affect the health of the baby she wants so badly.  Despite their actions, they just don't feel threatening, and the reader gets the impression that their captive could easily outwit them if she waits for the right moment.  The abuses heaped upon the protagonist are so mundane that it doesn't even earn points in the extreme horror category.  <br />Also included in this edition are two short stories.  \\"Brave Girl\\" follows the aftermath of a child's emergency call.  \\"Returns\\" is a bittersweet tale of a ghost who has one final task to complete.	2003-04-05

Then he asks them for another favor, one which they can't deliver.  Discomfited by his conversation, they eject him from the car.  But they haven't seen the last of Brand, nor will he leave their minds.  Each becomes obsessed with him in his or her own way.  Dan becomes preoccupied with thoughts of protecting his family, haunted by an attack on his wife years ago, and is driven to acts of violence of which he never thought himself capable.  Megan, a religious woman, thinks of Brand as a devil who watches her through the eyes of wild creatures.  And daughter Nikki finds herself attracted to him even as he terrifies her.<br />Lebbon's masterful handling of family dynamics and his understanding of the things which threaten them puts him in league with Steve and Melanie Tem, the premier writers of familial horror.  The story relies more on psychological terror and suspense, and when it does escalate into violence, it isn't gratuitous - which isn't to say it's not intense.  My one small disappointment came from the unanswered questions at the end, where we're only given hints of the larger picture.  I think I would have liked to know just a little bit more.  Still, better to err on the side of mystery.	2003-03-27

But a freak mishap has caused the participants to become murderous zombies.  The Doctor arrives just after the crisis has passed, and in a welcome deviation from the norm, he is not blamed for the incident (not at first, anyway), but praised for saving the day.  <br />The strange thing, of course, is that he hasn't done anything yet.  The stranger thing is that he died while doing it.  So our heroes travel further and further back in time to figure out exactly what happened.  It's great fun to see all the bits fall into place as the novel progresses.  The author handles the different timelines beautifully, and keeps it from being as confusing as it might have been.<br />The story may be a bit morbid, but this is an extremely funny book nonetheless.  The story, dialogue and supporting cast fit right in with the high camp nature of the era from which it is derived.  Most importantly, the characters of The Doctor, Romana and even K9 are flawlessly written, down to the most detailed mannerism.  It's such a faithful recreation that you'll swear you'd seen it on TV.  If you're a fan of the fourth Doctor, this is a must-read.	2003-03-13

Residing at a private school away from home, she receives a message that her father is trapped somewhere beyond the realm of the dead.  She must travel back to the Old Kingdom where she was born to free him, but finds herself pursued by dead forces which she may very well lack the training and experience to combat.<br />Sabriel's world is an unusual one in that there is magic as well as technology, but this book focuses more on the characters and leaves much of the world around them only hinted at.  In addition, the author drops us right into the action with little preamble.  This is disorienting at first, but it enables the reader to feel firmly entrenched in the world of the novel, and less like an outsider who is only reading about it.<br />While the story has a slow beginning, once Sabriel begins her journey it is gripping and suspenseful.  It is not exactly horror, but its imagery does set it firmly in the realm of dark fantasy.  And although it is written for and marketed to younger readers, adults should not find it beneath them.  The story is complete but one gets the feeling that there is still much to explore, and I am very much looking forward to doing so in the books that follow.	2003-03-04

His girlfriend just left him without explanation, but his life is really turned upside down when a body is found dead in the back of his pickup.  Knowing the police wont be of any help, he does some investigating of his own and uncovers secrets about his company that could make things much worse for him should they become known.  The expected noir elements are present: a man with a dark past thrown into situations he doesnt understand, a femme fatale whom you never know whether to trust, and an especially complicated plot.  <br />Taylor is known for her often graphic but always excellent short stories of sex and horror.  But where the sex in those stories was always integral, it seems included here mostly for shock value.  I simply cant imagine real people talking like some of them do in this novel.  <br />NAILED is trashy fun but not nearly up to the quality of her earlier, shorter work.  It should appeal to readers of Richard Laymon and similar authors.	2003-02-14

One begins in 1761 and concerns a young orphan named Eilish Eam, who earns her keep by playing music on water-filled glasses for passersby on the streets of one of London's poorer districts, until she is discovered by Dr. Benjamin Franklin.  Impressed with her talent, he offers her a proper place to stay in exchange for her services in developing and playing his own similar invention, which he calls his glass armonica.  <br />The other, which occurs in 2018, follows Erin Rushton, a professional musician whose specialty is an instrument that evolved from Franklin's original device.  Erin's brother, the composer of much of her repertoire, is undergoing experimental sound therapy to correct a neurological disorder, and her glass harmonica may provide the key.<br />The tales run concurrently in roughly alternating chapters, converging when each character glimpses or feels the ghostly presence of the other.  Erin wonders if she is losing her mind, since the harmonica is rumored to induce madness in sensitive individuals.  She also finds herself becoming romantically involved with her brother's doctor.  <br />THE GLASS HARMONICA is an uncommon mix of historical fantasy and science fiction drama.  I found the chapters set in the past more interesting, and it seems that the author may have as well; Eilish's world is described in rich detail while Erin's feels slightly underdeveloped.  I'm not sure that setting the latter in the future was necessary at all.  Most of the technological advances are superficial, and the relevant ones could have easily been worked into the present day.<br />While the story is not quite complex enough to warrant the book's page count, and the ending is somewhat contrived, I was thoroughly absorbed in the tale.  I recommend it especially if music and musicians are one of your literary fetishes.	2003-02-06

One morning, his assistant Kinoko arrives at his home/studio to find him in bed with a doll.  As if that wasn't strange enough, the doll walks and talks like a person.  Morino doesn't know where she came from, and neither of them is sure what to do with her.  This doll, which he names Lunch, has no memory of her past.    Most of the story focuses on Izumi's and Kinoko's relationship: she's got a crush on him, but she's too young for him to pursue (legally, at least.)  The mystery of the dolls -- as we discover there is more than one -- almost seems relegated to the background.    To be honest, I didn't really mind, as I found the human characters and issues more interesting anyway.  It just feels unbalanced.    Mikimoto is an excellent artist and he has a great sense of humor, but his storytelling skills leave something to be desired.  There were many sequences I found somewhat confusing.  It's not a major problem, but it is somewhat distracting.	2003-02-02

For those like me, who find much of their work either too dry or too juvenile, this is something different.  There's quite a bit of mild sexual humor (for example, there is a running joke regarding Chi's tendency to learn by copying others, including those she finds in certain magazines Hideki has scattered about his apartment) but it's not an adult book.  Chi manages to be both adorable and sexy in an innocent way.  It's one of the funniest things I've read in a while.	2003-01-30

The chapters alternate between recounting her vampiric origins and her current life (such as it is) as she prepares for the inevitable final conflict between herself and the longtime foe who murdered her brother.<br />At just under 150 pages, the plot is slight.  While the heroine does have a destination in mind, I didn't feel like there was much progress until the end.  Then, there is a twist in the tale that doesn't make sense.  <br />Whether it's fair or unfair to take the author's age into account, it really can't be ignored.  Rhodes was thirteen when she wrote this book, and for that, it is impressive.  It's even not bad for an older, more experienced writer.  Its intended audience, who will no doubt go on to reading Anne Rice novels, should enjoy it.	2003-01-13

It isn't long, however, before the original owner of the book wants it back.  Jill has to find the book, or things will get very ugly.  So Jill embarks on a wild quest that leads her to Las Vegas and back to L.A. in time to be coerced into appearing as an extra in a famous director's new film.  All the while a cadre of third-rate actors are hot on her tail.    LIKE A HOLE IN A HEAD is a hip and very funny mystery-adventure with a witty, sarcastic protagonist.  (Just my type!)  There are laughs on every page, even during the nasty bits.  My only small complaint is with Banbury's writing style.  She's constantly breaking up what should be longer sentences into fragments.  It's really distracting.  Better editing would have helped, but it's well worth overlooking.	2002-12-31

The collection starts off with some very good stories: a dying robber thinks of his father during his last moments; a delusional man spends half his waking hours in a fantasy world; a child's jealousy of his newborn brother grows; a man entertains a little girl who may or may not be his own.  Most of them are short, and they have a satisfying bite to them.<br />After these, the book takes a different track.  There are a few gems buried in the remainder, but too much of it consists of confused, disconnected ramblings.  Many of them, even the straightforward ones, simply left me shaking my head.  In addition, a number of stories couldn't be classified as horror even under the broadest definition, though I wouldn't have minded if they'd been better.  Overall, a disappointment.	2002-12-26

Not only has the incident been kept out of the media, but no one at the school seems to know anything about it.  Or at least, they're not talking.  Cal takes on the mystery of the murdered girl as his pet project, but completing it may cost him more than he bargained for.  He's bleeding again.<br />This is an excellent, atmospheric mystery with full characters and a genuine feel for setting.  There's something inherently creepy about a college campus in winter, and the author takes full advantage of that.  With this second novel (mine, not the author's -- I'd previously read THE DECEASED), Tom Piccirilli has risen to the top of my list of horror authors to watch out for.	2002-12-22

Searching for inspiration and answers, he finds himself regarded with suspicion by most of the town's populace, although he makes the friendship of a young widow who is engaged in a fierce custody battle with her very powerful father-in-law. Cryptic messages left in his home convince him he's not alone, and lead him to uncover a chilling mystery that's far greater than he could have imagined.<br />BAG OF BONES is by turns a legal drama, a romance, a mystery and a ghost story, and that last takes a back seat for much of the book. King wisely baits us with hints -- a quiet incident here or there, often at the end of a chapter of heavy character and plot development.  Those looking for ghouls and gore may be disappointed, but the story is all the more stronger for it. These are hauntings of the fairly typical variety, and it's a testament to King's skill as a writer that they are more frightening than perhaps they should be to the experienced reader.  It's only toward the end of the novel, where the supernatural forces come to a head, that it loses some of its credibility.  It's a final confrontation that rivals those in \\"The Library Policeman\\" or \\"The Sun Dog\\" -- not a good thing -- and cheapens what was a high quality read.  But this is just a small flaw (it's a big book.)  I'm pleased to number BAG OF BONES among King's best.	2002-12-15

He arrives in present day New Orleans to stumble upon a murder, apparently committed to obtain a mysterious artifact -- an artifact which later turns up in the Doctor's own pocket. At the same time, an unknown force is threatening the TARDIS. Add in a homicide detective who has eyes on the Doctor's companion Anji, a melodramatic tour guide with mystical aspirations, a talented but very eccentric artist, and some water elementals and you've got THE CITY OF THE DEAD.<br />It's a bit of a mess, really.<br />The main story involves a magician with designs on using the Doctor in a ritual for reasons which are never made quite clear. The problem is that there are so many characters and subplots going that none of them get explored adequately. To confuse matters, there seems to have been a lapse in editing in the last quarter of the novel that results in some serious jump cuts. At the end of one chapter, the Doctor has the upper hand on the villain. At the beginning of the next, said villain is going about some other business elsewhere; then suddenly, he is back and has the Doctor on the ropes again. Was there something missing here? Also, a number of time issues throughout don't make sense.<br />Finally, the book suffers from awkward attempts to direct it toward a more adult audience.  I'm more than happy to see DOCTOR WHO maturing with it's fans, but the \\"mature\\" happenings in this story come off as clumsy and even absurd.<br />The Doctor is still amnesiac, although thankfully he is not as much of a nonentity as he was in THE BURNING, the last DW novel I read. He is well-characterized, but that's really the only positive thing this author has accomplised.	2002-12-12

Said the Ticktockman,\\" in which a relentless prankster causes bits of chaos in a rigidly structured society, and the final message of which appears to be \\"You can make a difference; you can put a dent in the machine.\\"<br />Earth's discarded freaks roam the spaceways; a method actor takes his art to the limit; a man is trapped in a room with a robot programmed to obliterate anything that moves; another man finds he has slipped through perception's cracks.<br />If there is one weakness to the collection it is that some of the stories seem too similar.  The theme of a man stranded alone on an alien planet appears a number of times.  The details vary, but not enough to make them distinct.<br />Still, while this material may not be as powerful as that in Ellison's other collections (to be fair, it is very early work), it is a book worth picking up should you come across it.  At least, until the rest of those Edgeworks come out.	2002-12-10
US	52138947	RSLA808HX5T6J	0802135595	44348829	The Keepsake	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Dreamlike, bewildering	I'm almost not sure what to make of this novel.  It is, ostensibly, about a young girl's journey to adulthood under the influence of a mother who only partially exists in the real world.  Her father is absent, although she hears much about him, and some of it may be true.  The girl's narration shifts from her present to her mother's past until they seem to become one, the implication being that she is travelling down the same road as her mother once did.<br />Gunn's prose is beautiful, almost verging on poetry.  While this style struck a perfect balance in her previous masterpiece, RAIN, it's well out of control here.  She is deliberately vague throughout, and it's detrimental to the storytelling.  She also tends to belabor scenes endlessly.  When you read fifty pages, you should feel that the story has progressed in some fashion.<br />By the time the book reached its shocking, violent climax, I felt lost.  Perhaps I didn't grasp what was truly happening -- like a dream, it feels only just out of reach.	2002-12-10

He starts with the destruction of an entire country's population and just keeps on going.  A mystery villain from Xavier's past has an agenda: to destroy the world's mutants -- and it looks like she has a very good chance of succeeding.  <br />As you can see, Morrison isn't afraid of shaking things up.  In fact, this is exactly what he was brought on to do.  Included as an appendix is \\"Morrison's Manifesto,\\" a look at the creative process behind this reenvisioning, as well as the original concepts for this particular storyline.  It helps one (particularly a long-time reader) understand why certain changes were implemented.  I won't go into detail, but there are quite a few surprises.<br />Morrison writes a gripping story.  Forget the usual comics status quo.  Forget how everything always turns out okay in the end.  You really feel that the characters are in serious danger from a threat that seems to have all the cards stacked in her favor.  This could well be the X-Men's darkest hour, and that's not hyperbole.<br />The art, for the most part, is very good.  \\"Regular\\" artist Frank Quitely, odd stylistic quirks aside, has a clean, detailed look to his work that I've liked for some time.  It's nice to see Cyclops looking \\"Slim\\" once more, after the ridiculously over-muscled nineties.  Unfortunately, Quitely apparently couldn't keep up with the schedule of the monthly series so there are some fill-ins.  Ethan Van Sciver does well on his installments, but Igor Kordey's art is sloppy and unclear and is the only thing that drags the book down.  Quitely returns for the final chapter, ending it on a positive note.<br />This book reprints NEW X-MEN #114-126 and the 2001 annual.  Some of this material previously appeared in a trade paperback called E IS FOR EXTINCTION, but I'm glad to have the entire story in a quality hardcover volume.	2002-11-30

You have to try pretty hard to convince me that anything new or interesting can be done with vampires.<br />SISTERS OF THE NIGHT is a collection of fifteen stories concerning female vampires, and for the most part, it doesn't try hard enough.  Contained within are stories of vampires among the homeless, a dying elderly man who is visited by the vampire lover who left him decades before, a couple old world vampire tales and a detective story.  There is also an excerpt from one of Larry Niven's RINGWORLD novels -- a questionable practice, as it invariably ends up looking like an advertisement for another book, as well as making it seem like the editor couldn't find enough new material to fill the page count.<br />There may be variety to an extent, but few of the stories are original enough or good enough to be memorable afterward.  I often found myself bored as I paged through most of them.  One exception is Tanith Lee's \\"La Dame,\\" which offers something truly different by broadening the definitions of both \\"vampire\\" and \\"female.\\"  The other is Steve and Melanie Tem's \\"Mama,\\" which is the type of perverse familial horror story at which both authors always excel.<br />If vampires in any form still fascinate you, you'll probably want to pick up this volume as you'll surely enjoy it.  If, like me, you think the vampire subgenre should be laid to rest at last, pass on it or check out the above mentioned entries only.  Note: Lee's story also appears in Ellen Datlow & Terri Windling's YEAR'S BEST anthology for 1995.  Unfortunately, the Tems didn't make it.	2002-11-21
US	52138947	R33LZKYY94IXDV	0843949074	209292592	House of Pain	Books	1	1	3	N	N	Just painful.	A young couple moves into a house with a grisly past. One of them is aware of this; the other is oblivious until she begins to see horrific images in the basement. The novel belabors this situation for about three quarters of the way, after which the plot takes a serious left turn that everyone but the protagonist can see coming. Girón throws in a lot of weirdness for weirdness' sake, such as a man who can remove his skin to feed his company of wolves, but none of it is ever justified. It all leads up to a climax where the ultimate villain of the book is defeated by someone throwing a stick at it.  Really.<br />The prose is terrible, as is the dialogue. Nobody uses contractions so they all sound like robots at one time or another. Where was the editor?  Perhaps he or she didn't think it worth the trouble.<br />Leisure has published some great work that you won't want to miss.  This isn't one of them	2002-11-13

THE BURNING takes place entirely in and outside a nineteenth century English village fast on its way to economic decline.  It is winter, yet this is tempered by unexplained cracks in the earth that deliver unnatural heat.  Enter one Roger Nepath, a mysterious entrepreneur with a plan to revitalize the town and an unhealthy fixation on a dead sibling.  What's his connection with the strange geological activity, and what does he really want?<br />This is an eighth Doctor adventure, and my first exposure to the character since the unjustly maligned TV movie some years back.  I was disappointed to find his appearance here distinctly lacking in personality.  I found as I read on that the Doctor had lost his memory in a previous adventure, but this doesn't really excuse the weak characterization.  He says and does very little for most of the novel, and except for a few brief heated dialogues, is almost a nonentity.  Perhaps if I'd read previous novels I'd see this development more clearly as far as the big picture goes, but the book gives no indication that knowledge of prior adventures is necessary (or at least helpful.)  I know that some of the novels state where a story takes place in the larger mythos, but that is lacking here -- an unfortunate oversight.  It's fine if they want to carry ongoing subplots, but I'd like to know about it beforehand.  I felt like I was in the dark as much as the Doctor was.  If, like me, you do not intend to read every Doctor Who novel that is published, and prefer to pick and choose, you may want to pass on this one as it doesn't stand on its own very well.<br />The story itself is weak.  I can't mention many details without spoiling it, but the whole thing simply does not come together as well as it should.  There is much time given to the supposed importance of a strange new mineral, yet it proves to be completely irrelevant to the latter half of the story.  The villain's plan is also not explained adequately.  In the end, everything conspired to make THE BURNING an unsatisfying read.	2002-11-02

From the nondescript cover art and the generic title, to a back cover summary that makes it sound like a hundred other tired tales of terror.  It even begins in a fairly standard way.<br />Jacob Maelstrom is a writer of horror novels, himself the son of a more famous writer.  He finds himself drawn once again to his childhood home -- the place where, over a decade ago, his sister killed the rest of his family and herself, leaving only him alive.<br />It's been done before, right?  It may seem so, but what follows takes the story in entirely different directions.  Family secrets are revealed, other players are introduced, and the book becomes an exploration into the very nature of creativity.  Where does it come from?  Where does it go?  When does the fictional become real?  The answers lie within the old Maelstrom house, if you care to spend the night with Jacob and his uninvited guests.<br />Piccirilli's excellent prose goes a long way in carrying the story.  I'm always happy to see someone who really knows how to use the language, rather than one who is merely adequate.  THE DECEASED is a fine novel of chilling horror, suspense, and eroticism.	2002-11-02

If you've ever read any of Elizabeth Massie's short fiction, you know that very few of her characters could ever be described as normal. They usually run the gamut from slightly unhinged to utterly demented. In this collection you'll meet sideshow freaks, abusive parents, sadistic prison guards, entire families who are living in their own fantasy worlds, and a pair of orphans whose destiny is to prevent global annihilation. You'll witness the cruelty of children, betrayal of the deepest kind, and more than one instance of self-mutilation.<br />Elizabeth Massie is one of the finest writers of modern reality-based horror. Her characters may be unusual, but they are all within the realm of possibility in our world, which is what makes them frightening.  There is but a single story with any supernatural elements, and it's the weakest of the lot.  Massie belongs on the same shelf as Kathe Koja and A. M. Homes. The darkness in her stories comes from the recesses of the human mind.	2002-08-10

As John Pelan's previous anthology DARKSIDE was one of the best collections of horror I've ever read, I couldn't have been more excited to see a second volume.  Having finished it, I have to confess to being a little disappointed.<BR><br />The book starts off with a handful of strong entries. Edo van Belkom's story concerns harbingers of death that only one woman can see. Simon Clark presents us with a woman with the ability to exact supernatural vengeance on those who have betrayed her, only now the betrayal comes a little too close to home. Brian Hodge, in a story of the quietest horror, shows us that not only can you go home again, but that you have no choice in the matter.<BR><br />There is a lot of variety in the stories presented. Some are quite strange. Tom Piccirilli creates a character with most unusual appetite. Lucy Taylor explores an interesting psychological concept that I wish had been explored just a little further. Mehitobel Wilson's entry appears at first to be an agoraphobe's nightmare, but is soon revealed to be something much more sinister. Joel Lane provides us with a touching story of lost and found love, although the ending is a bit bewildering. There are also very good entries from Caitlin Kiernan and Ann Schwader, whose tale builds up a strong feeling of impending doom while leaving the mystery intact.<BR><br />As probably should be expected, there are a number of weaker entries as well. Poppy Z. Brite once again tells of rock stars and vampires in a heavyhanded allegory (fans = bloodsuckers...get it?) David Silva recounts the genesis of a killer in a history that contains no surprises. Pelan's own story drags on far too long and is also predictable. Richard Laymon, as usual, caters to the lowest common denominator in a story that simply isn't very good. And Brian Keene's submission uses a concept that is so played out in the milieu of horror fiction that I can't believe it still finds its way to print.<BR><br />As with most anthologies, you've got to be prepared to take the bad with the good. This one's previous installment, unfortunately, set my expectations to be quite high. I still recommend picking this one up, but it's just not as good as it could have been.	2002-08-03

I loved the first two Crystal Singer books, but I read them many years ago, when I was much younger.  CRYSTAL LINE, short as it is, was very difficult to get through.  The prose is pandering, and the dialogue is downright nauseating.  Make no bones about it, this is a romance novel with token trappings of science fiction.  I almost expected to see Fabio posing as Lars for the cover.  SF for lonely housewives!  Add to that a barely-there plot and a tacked-on-for-a-bit-of-excitement finale, and this book ends up being a huge disappointment.	2001-10-18

It's been a long time since I've read some King, and since I've liked most of his work I was eager to get into this anthology.  As I worked my way well into it, however, disappointment began to set in.<br /> The lead-off story is the strongest.  It's an exciting story about a select group of airplane passengers who arrive in a dead and vacant world.  Though the premise (like those of the other three stories as well) is derivative of old Twilight Zone episodes, King keeps it going with interest, action, and fascinating concepts.  My only real bug with this story is that the &quot;langoliers&quot; reminded me of nothing so much as evil Pac-Men, and that took away the fear factor once they made their appearance.<br /> &quot;Secret Window, Secret Garden&quot; is average.  The main character defies logic by not going to the authorities when his mysterious nemesis threatens him with violence, though I suppose this could be explained by the psychology that is revealed at the end of the story.  As for the twist ending, I've seen it before in later works by others, but that's not King's fault.  Still, it takes the sting out.<br /> &quot;The Library Policeman&quot; is essentially a shorter (but not nearly as good) rewrite of 'It.'  Why bother?  The villain of the piece ends up being another monster that is unexplained and her defeat is just plain silly.  Come to think of it, most of this story is silly.<br /> But &quot;The Sun Dog&quot; tops even that.  A chilling premise (one that King would hack out again for the '999' anthology) builds to a lunatic and nonsensical climax.  Again, we are offered no explanation for the phenomena the characters experience, and the ending is straight out of a cheap horror flick.<br /> With the possible exception of the first story, all of these are overwritten and way too long.  I found myself skimming passages of useless exposition.  Most of this anthology is mediocre and probably wouldn't have gotten published if a big name hadn't written them (then again, Bentley Little manages to get published, so maybe anything goes after all.)em (then again, Bentley Little manages to get published, so maybe anything goes after all.)	2001-01-01

And so John Shirley follows (or perhaps leads, since this was first published in 1993) the latest wave of hack writers (Little, Laymon, Dee)  dragging the horror genre into its grave.  Pedestrian story aside, Shirley  writes without an iota of style or subtlety.  The prose is clumsy and  liberally peppered with adolescent profanity usage that is distracting and  dull.  It's not that the content is explicit -- look at Lucy Taylor for an  author who can write graphically, but with finesse.  This is low-grade  work.<BR><BR> As a side note, Dorchester Publishing ought to be embarrassed  to release an edition so fraught with typographical errors.  The book is  filled with misspellings, forgotten punctuation, etc.  How about a little  more care in editing, and also a more careful selection of material?	2000-08-13

A haunted nursing home -- not the sort of thing I'd have picked up on sight, but I loved the three other books I've read by Melanie that I was willing to try anything.  As one of the blurbs states, she is unequalled in  the realm of familial horror. <BR><BR> It's a disappointment -- and a  surprise -- that this novel is dull for the most part.  Occasional  hauntings permeate the book, but most of the story is concerned with the  mundane lives of the home's inhabitants.  If you're interested in that sort  of thing, maybe you'll like this book more than I did.  The pace doesn't  change until the end, a sudden and inexplicable conclusion that doesn't  satisfy on any level.  THE TIDES lacks the gripping psychological drama of  PRODIGAL or the imaginative reinvention of horror standards of WILDING.   Let's hope her next novel is up to par.	2000-07-23

This is b-movie stuff, and  fit only for a short story or novella, if that.  Like Bentley Little's  UNIVERSITY, the author simply uses a device (in this case, the rain) as a  vehicle for sex and violence, but there's even less to this particular  story.<BR><BR><br />ONE RAINY NIGHT is easy to breeze through, and if you're  looking for something to read on the train or on the beach it may be  perfect.

LOST FUTURES takes on the fascinating concept of alternate realities: the theory that at the point of any given choice, reality splits and continues on for each outcome.  In this book, a young woman becomes obsessed with the  possibility of crossing over to a better life, where her brother did not  die, where she made something more of her life.  Thankfully the absurdity  of quantum theory is abandoned early on, but after a series of several  &quot;awakenings&quot;, one begins to look for some kind of direction, and  there isn't any.

Stock characters and monsters fill this story of a town that has suffered a mysterious and complete disappearance of all it's inhabitants.  The first half or so builds up interest, but the rest is by the numbers.  Worse is  Koontz' tedious writing style, the way he has to not only explicitly spell  out every last detail of what is happening (either in action or in the  characters' thoughts), but he has to then beat the concepts into the  readers' heads.  PHANTOMS might be okay beach or travel reading, but I  can't recommend it any other way at all.	1999-02-11
