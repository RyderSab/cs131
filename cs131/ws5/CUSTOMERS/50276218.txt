For the first time ever, I began to see consistent, noticable improvements on a workout to workout basis, initially gaining over 25 pounds of muscle over a period of only a few months. I eventually became certified as a personal trainer by the SuperSlow Exercise Guild, who also advocate a high intensity training (HIT) protocol similar to Mike's, the only major difference being the use of a slower rep cadence which provides for a lower risk of injuries. Having trained hundreds of clients using HIT since 1994, I can say with absolute confidence that it is by far the safest, most productive, and most time efficient way to train. Whatever is in second place is so far behind as to not even be in the running.<br />HIT is not, as some reviewers have erroneously stated, conducive to injuries, so long as the exercises are performed properly - that is, using strict form and a smooth, controlled speed of movement. Lift the weights slowly and under strict control, and reverse direction smoothly, rather than simply swinging, bouncing or throwing them up and then allowing them to drop the way most people do in the gym. It isn't the amount of weight that causes injuries, but the manner in which one attempts to lift it. HIT is perfectly safe if the exercises are performed properly. Mike addresses this issue in the book.<br />HIT does happen to be the \\"be all, end all\\" of exercise. There can only be one best, one most efficient, one most effective means of accomplishing a particular goal, and where exercise is concerned, this is it. The principles of productive exercise are the same for all of us, it is merely the specifics that must be adjusted for individual differences, which is accounted for in HIT theory, and in Mike's books. Even if another training method produced similar results, if it required you to spend a greater amount of time in the gym it could still not be considered equal, since the return on investment would be lower. For those who's social lives revolve around the gym or who are stuck in their ways, this may take some getting used to. Personally, I'd rather spend only as much time in the gym as necessary to get the best results. The purpose of exercise is to improve the quality of your life, and NOT to be the center of it.<br />Get in the gym, train hard, then get out and enjoy your life.<br />This is the most thorough of all of Mike's books. It covers all of the principles of his Heavy Duty high intensity training system in detail, and provides routines and explanations of the performance of various exercises. There is a section with information specifically written for the competitive bodybuilder on peaking, definition and posing.

What Steve Gartin teaches in this video is effective, but goes way past what is necessary for self-defense. If you're looking to learn a little about the Silat and Kuntao approaches to using a knife, this is a good video, but if you're looking for practical self defense, please consider that in the eyes of the law, the things in this video are total overkill. The most important thing in a self defense situation is to stop the attack, and remove yourself from the situation. However, most of the techniques shown go way beyond stopping the attack, to the point of manslaughter.<br />The material is effective, but you have to know when to stop so that you don't go from being the defender to the aggressor, or you may find yourself in prison.	2004-01-19

The emphasis throughout the book is on avoiding or controlling what is referred to as \\"the contact connection\\", the connection of your attacker to his knife and his knife to any part of your body. Simple and effective tactics and techniques are presented for dealing with attacks starting in non-contact range, contact range, and extreme close quarters, along with drills to practice them shown step by step with easy-to-follow photographs and instructions.<br />Part 1, Fundamentals of Edged Weapons Defense Technology, presents an overview of the history of the knife and covers a variety of subjects including the importance of edged weapons training, how to choose a knife and training knives, the anatomy of attack and defense, carry and deployment, and a variety of grips and common attacks. Most importantly, part 1 covers a variety of defensive movements and postures using gross motor skills and based on natural movements, used to move you off the line of attack while covering your vitals.<br />Everything presented is highly practical and with enough practice can be performed successfully against an attack performed at full speed and with intent. As a test, I convinced a notoriously uncoordinated friend to practice moving off the line of attack and performing the QuickShield position to cover his vitals as shown in the book. After about half an hour performing the first few drills he was able to consistently evade 1/2 speed attacks on the low line from non-contact position - the distance at which with both of our arms extended we could not touch each other. A person with average or better agility should be able to successfully defend against full speed attacks at that range with consistent practice.<br />Part 2, Defending Against Non-Contact and Contact Range Attacks, covers ways of moving off of the line of attack and out to a safe distance against attacks from non-contact range, and defenses against both low-line and high-line attacks at contact range - the distance at which with both people's arms extended they can touch wrist to wrist. These defenses include methods of breaking and clearing - stepping off the line of attack while shielding the vitals using the QuickShield position then pushing the attacker's knife arm down and away or transitioning into elbow controls, primarily the arm bar and figure-four arm lock. Again, our uncoordinated test subject was able to make these work against me attacking at about 1/2 speed with a little bit of practice and coaching, and I am able to make them work against him despite a weight disadvantage of over 80 lbs. All of it practical, effective stuff that can be made to work well with consistent practice.<br />Part 3, Defense and Disarming at Extreme Close Quarters, covers footwork, controls and disarms for situations where one has to defend against an attacker only an arm's length away, such as when one is up against a rear obstacle and unable to move back away off the line of attack and the only way out is to go past the attacker. The emphasis here is still on avoiding the contact connection and getting away, and it is stressed that disarms should only be attempted if there are absolutely no other options. A few basic strip and takeaway disarms are covered against both forward and reverse-grip attacks. As with everything else, these are all demonstrated with step-by-step photos and instructions, and are simple and practical techniques. Simple, however, does not mean easy. Like everything else, you have to spend time practicing them to expect them to work when it counts.<br />Overall, The Naked Edge is one of the best books I've read on the subject of dealing with knife attacks, and I highly recommend it.of moving off of the line of attack and out to a safe distance against attacks from non-contact range, and defenses against both low-line and high-line attacks at contact range - the distance at which with both people's arms extended they can touch wrist to wrist.

Even better, though, is to videotape someone with good form performing the forms, once from the front and once from the side and practice with those.<br />Although the reviewer &quot;Jonathus&quot; is correct that most fights are short and won with good basics, the rest of his comments would indicate that he does not have enough of an understanding of Wing Chun to &quot;get&quot; some of the photo sequences in the book. His statement that &quot;one does not attack by pointing his fingers at an opponent and hopping on one leg towards his target&quot; is correct, but if he understood what is depicted in that particular photo sequence or had been taught the movement, he would realize that that is not what is happening. The movement is an entry meant to draw a reaction to gain an attachment from which to trap and attack or open a line of attack.	2003-04-26

Although the photographs are very well done, and other than a few minor typographical errors, the descriptions are clear to me, I've shown the book to friends who've had no instruction in Jun Fan or Wing Chun and they weren't able to figure out how perform the drills properly from the book.<br />If you already know Wing Chun or Jun Fan, the drills are helpful, but if you don't, you're not going to learn trapping from them. It is also important to note for those w/o training that these are meant as drills and not techniques. I suggest finding a qualified Jun Fan or Wing Chun instructor (there is a directory of certified Jun Fan/JKD instructors at Dan Inosanto's web site) and then get this book after you've learned some trapping and the ping chuei gua chuie and 1-2 and 1-3 series. You'll get a lot more out of it then.<br />The book also contains a section on the Jun Fan wooden dummy form, but like the trapping drills, unless you already have the training, you may have a difficult time figuring how he's moving between the photographs.<br />Like all of Larry Hartsell's other books, this one is a must for any Jun Fan/JKD student's library, but it might be a bit hard for the untrained to get what's going on. If you're really interested though, go find a teacher :)	2003-04-22

After browsing this book AGAIN at the local MA store, I am only further convinced that all of the good reviews of it here are by friends of the author trying to help him out. It is not about Jeet Kune Do, it is a collection of poorly presented grappling techniques that appear to come primarily from BJJ.<br />Like another reviewer said, the author mentions no certifications or instructorship under any recognized JKD instructor. Also, like the other reviewer said, \\"studying\\" someone is hardly the same as studying WITH someone. I challenge the author to provide proof of instructor certification in JKD. Without that, the author has no business claiming to be writing about Jeet Kune Do.<br />The author seems to just be using the name Jeet Kune Do to promote his book. Obviously, if it just had a title like \\"Ground Fighting\\" or \\"Ground Fighting Techniques and Counters\\" or \\"Practical Ground Fighting Skills for the Street\\", then it would not stand out among the many grappling and ground fighting books available by recognized grappling experts such as the Machados and Gracies and a true Jeet Kune Do instructor and grappling expert, Larry Hartsell.<br />If you're interested in learning more about Jeet Kune Do, my first recommendation is to search for a qualified instructor. There is a directory of certified instructors at Dan Inosanto's web site. For those who don't know, Dan Inosanto was Bruce Lee's long time friend and student, and one of only three people who Bruce certified to teach Jun Fan Gung Fu and Jeet Kune Do (the others being Taky Kimura and the late James Lee). Most of the other original Chinatown school students like Larry Hartsell continued to train with Dan Inosanto after Bruce's death.<br />There is absolutely nothing that can take the place of learning firsthand from a qualified instructor. This is not to say that books and videos aren't helpful, as they can serve as useful study guides and sometimes help us to understand certain aspects of an art or fill in the holes in the notebooks of those of us who don't keep very good class notes (if you don't keep a training journal, start now!). Having said that, my second recommendation is to read all of the books on JKD by Chris Kent, Tim Tackett, Larry Hartsell, John Little, Ron Balicki and the excellent book on Jun Fan by Kevin R. Seaman, and if you can find them, Dan Inosanto. The book Jeet Kune Do Conversations by Jose Fraguas is also excellent.<br />If you are interested in grappling books, then I would recommend Larry Hartsell's JKD books and Marc MacYoung's \\"Floor Fighting\\", as well as The Fighter's Notebook.<br />I do not, however, recommend spending your money on this book, as it is not JKD, and it is not a very good grappling book either. If you are still considering it because of all the 5 star reviews (which I suspect were posted by friends of the author), I suggest browsing it first at your local martial arts store if they bothered to stock it.

If you are concerned with practical self defense, then I'd recommend it over any of the BJJ books I've read.<br />Vunak covers a variety of subjects, including his RAT (Rapid Assault Tactics) approach, women's self defense, Jeet Kune Do applications for law enforcement officers, and the differences between sport fighting and self defense (which some of the other reviewers would benefit from reading), and developing \\"killer instinct\\". Various techniques are also illustrated to demonstrate the principles discussed in each chapter. Not a lot of material is covered, but the book is a good value for the price.	2003-01-02

I was surprised when I found out that there was another Rogue Warrior novel coming out, since John Weisman had replied to an e-mail I had written him, stating that he was not going to write any more novels in the series. Apparently, he had been doing the vast majority, if not all of the work on the previous novels, with Marcinko simply giving feedback and approval, which would explain why Violence of Action is so different than the rest of the series.<br />Although Violence of Action is lacking in plot intricacy and character development, it makes up for it somewhat in the action department - which is literally non-stop and definitely lives up to the book's title.<br />As for the people who complained about the torture that occurs in the book - they need to realize that there are situations where such measures, however distasteful, are absolutely necessary and justified. Especially when you're talking about millions of innocent lives. Consider the fact that the individuals being interrogated were guilty of conspiring to murder hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians for the sake of starting a race war, and that timely intelligence was essential to prevent that from happening. If you had loved ones trapped in a city about to be nuked and their lives depended on you obtaining that information as fast as possible, what would you have done? If you'd have spared a terrorist rather than try to save those people, you need to seriously examine your ethics, because frankly, they're irrational.	2002-11-22

I'm a student of Inosanto-LaCoste Kali and Maphilindo Silat, have studied Pambuan Arnis Tulison Caballero under Ama Guru Rafino Pambuan, and have informal training in Pekiti Tirsia Kali, all of which are blade oriented systems, so I know more than a little bit about handling a knife, and the techniques shown against a knife in this book will get you killed.<br />I hate to disappoint those of you who hope to learn physical self defense from a book, but you can't. You can learn concepts, tactics, strategies, and techniques, but without actual self defense or martial arts instruction in person with a real teacher you're not going to really get it. After that, you can take what you learn from books to augment your training, but without actual training, they're not going to help you much. Even worse, books like this could get you killed if you were to actually attempt some of what they try to pass off as defenses against attacks with a knife.<br />Don't believe me? Try this experiment. Put on a white T shirt. Give a friend a magic marker and bet them $10 per mark that they can't mark you with it - anywhere, arms, torso, legs, face (wear protective eyewear). My money says that they mark you up, and consider that a criminal trying to cut you is most likely far more motivated and far more aggressive.<br />For a book with a more practical, realistic perspective on self defense situations involving knives, I suggest reading \\"Knives, Knife Fighting, and Related Hassles\\" by Marc MacYoung. His other books on various aspects of self defense are also excellent reads.	2002-05-25

Regardless of what style you study, an understanding of these principles and how to apply them will make you a more effective martial artist.<br />I also highly recommend Bob Orlando's video, &quot;Fighting Arts of Indonesia - Combat Secrets of Silat and Kuntao&quot; which makes a great companion to the book.	2002-05-25
US	50276218	R2KCQSJFZE2ASF	0760305250	68499868	Drive to Survive (Motorbooks Workshop)	Books	5	3	5	N	Y	required reading for the safety conscious	I highly recommend this book to anyone who is concerned with their personal safety. It provides practical information for dealing with various types of dangerous driving situations.<br />It is apparent though, that some reviewers who had a problem with the level of violence or risk involved in some of the tactics and maneuvers described in the book are talking from the perspective of people who haven't had to deal with much violence and have no idea what it's like to be in a life threatenning situation.<br />Just because it's outside of the scope of their experience, doesn't mean that some of us do not have to deal with situations where dealing with certain types of people very, very aggressively is not only appropriate, but often the only option. If you ever do find yourself in such a situation, the information in this book can improve your odds significantly.	2001-06-20

I usually buy every Jeet Kune Do related book I find, but after going through it at our local martial arts supply store I decided it would be an embarrasment to have on my bookshelf.	2000-09-30
