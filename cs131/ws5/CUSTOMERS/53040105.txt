Highlighting the many practical steps that he uses to stimulate your thinking, it was easy to adapt these suggestions into actionable steps to achieve our company's own growth plan.<br />However, I was cautious to write a summary of the book until I distributed some copies to my team and tested the acceptance of these basic principles to revenue growth. I have seen some people scoff at some of Ram's recommendations because they appear to be too basic...too simple to really make a difference.  For example:  &quot;Revenue Growth is everyone's business, so make it part of everyone's daily work routine.&quot;  or &quot;Seek good growth and avoid bad growth.&quot;  Easy to just read over the titles...hard to really implement with every sales person, account manager...every employee on a equal understanding and commitment.<br />After discussing with the management team, getting each to focus not just on cost productivity, but also revenue generation and revenue productivity, we determined that getting back to basics would prove a cultural challenge, but one we must tackle.  Too many companies have driven &quot;cost focus&quot; into the heads of every sales person, purchasing agent, accountant, middle-manager...and stopped focusing on the business survival requirement-all companies must grow or they die.<br />This book, along with Ram Charan's other book, &quot;Every Business is a Growth Business&quot; should be must reads for your key employees.<br />I recommend to all leaders that you personally adopt this book as a personal coaching tool with your key growth engine-your employees.	2004-02-16

This book is very well written, illustrated and logical.  Dave Pelz can put into words, his method or system for allowing you to consistently control your short game shots. <br />You must read and try the method to understand Pelz's system. Easy to read...the next day I practiced the concepts, measured the results and applied the lessons learned from the system.   Over the next month...with some short game practice, my overall handicap dropped 4 strokes.  The guessing game of which short game stick and how much swing to put on the ball were over...my confidence greatly improved because of the system.  Try it yourself.  Very recommended.	2003-03-02

This is the first solo book by Jeff Shaara to follow the Killer Angels, written by his father and made even more famous by the movie Gettysburg.  <br />Many history books get too bogged down in the day-to-day details of recounting history.  Shaara makes the historical events come alive by re-telling history through the lives of key players...in this case, Lee, Hancock, Jackson and Chamberlin.  History is made by people and these four men certainly influenced history greatly.<br />Learn history like you never have and re-live the time building up to the Gettysburg battle.  I highly recommend the reading to those that enjoy biographies or want to learn more about history without becoming a history buff.	2003-03-02

If you have already grooved your workout habits and can't miss a tough workout each day...this plan might help you get lean...but this is not for bodybuilders.<br />If you don't want to ask why the diet works...then go for it.  However, I thought the dietary premises to lack real thought...poorly supported by data...and not very helpful.  Hofmekler wants you to just trust him.  When it comes to maximizing the investment that you already make in working out...I would suggest Fit for Life or Zone books to better explain nutrition programs.	2003-03-02

However, the reader of 2003 might very well pick up this book looking for a typical thriller from Ludlum and some modern day world events.  When the book first released, many readers would likely think the plot and scenarios of a bio-terror threat to the world to be a stretch.  Not today!  With the threat of terrorists, willing to do anything to obtain biological germs, be interesting today...you bet!<br />So if a smallpox scare and a space shuttle thriller is on your mind...take a few hours and fly through this one.  I recommend it the time to be worth reading.	2003-03-02

Based on the events that occurred to solve THE navigational problem of plotting longitude, Dava Sobel, writes a very clear and easy to read tale of events.  I will admit that at first, I put off reading this book for a year because I could not find the subject very thrilling.  <br />Now that I read this book, I wished I had read it earlier as the events in the key inventor's life, John Harrison, tell a tremendous story for all innovators and inventors.  Mr. Harrison, an unknown clock maker, solved one of the most critical problems of it's day, by looking to unconventional means to solve the problem.  From Galileo to Newton, some pretty illustrious names can be found leading the charge to discover an accurate means of plotting longitude.  The problem was so vital and strategic to naval superiority and dominance in commerce, that the British government funded a worldwide challenge for anyone that could discover how to determine longitude and prove that it accurately worked on a consistent basis.<br />While many of the world's leading scientists and astronomers were convinced that the only way to calculate longitude was from the movements of the stars and moons, Mr. Harrison created an extremely accurate timepiece and proved that his invention worked.  Yet politics, greed and his own perfectist traits kept him from being recognized and awarded the grand prize...<br />I will highly recommend this book to my sons to read and to all my business associates that are so focused on bringing innovation to the market place, but spend too much time trying to perfect their ideas.	2002-12-26

However, once I picked up this book, I could not put it down.<br />The author even admits that the results were surprising, that many of the traits of the leaders, culture and style of the \\"great\\" businesses did not fit the mold of what we would normally expect.  How timely to read about great companies when so many companies are being destroyed by their leadership.  The findings were surprising to me also...but supported what I believe is the key problem with today's CEO's...short term focus to satisfy Wall Street.  \\"Good to Great\\" confirms that these companies and their leaders are building businesses...not for this quarter's results, but for the long run.<br />You will discover the findings of \\"Level 5 Leadership\\" to be eye-opening and refreshing...but very contrary to the \\"star\\" CEO stereotype that the media honors.  You will also get very good insight into \\"First Who, Then What\\".  This will be a hard concept for many executives to really grasp and adapt to, as it has the nuance that really good employees can better define the direction than the leader....Mmmm.<br />I personally also enjoyed the \\"Technology Accelerators\\" section from my first-hand experience in dealing with corporate innovation initiatives.  The author's findings support that great companies \\"apply\\" today's technology...you don't have to invent the new technology. This is really a hard concept for corporate executives to understand.<br />This is a keeper...I highly recommend this book.  A must read for business leaders that really, I mean, really have a passion for \\"building\\" a business that will last.  I don't think that there are too many executives out there that truly understand that anymore...these findings just have not been a part of executive scorecards for quite some time.  It is time to learn from these findings and change our leadership ways.	2002-08-03

I will admit to being skeptical when I was first introduced to this book.  I had not read the original book, &quot;Leading Change&quot; by John Kotter for the same reason that I was reluctant this time...books that focus on change mangement are generally too dry and formula driven.  This book was also driven upon the 8-step process highlighted in the first book.<br />However, I was told that the book focused this time more on the behavior changes of people that are needed to make change successful...and from experience, I knew that getting employees to really want to make a change makes all the difference to a successful change effort.<br />The book uses stories to describe how to educate and motivate others to accept change through the 8-step process.  If you just look at the eight steps, they appear dry and built on well-worn cliches.  Increase Urgency, Build the Guiding Team, Get the Vision Right, Communicate for Buy-In, Empower Action, Create Short-Term Wins, Don't Let Up, and Make Change Stick.  Certainly, anyone that has led change can figure this out.<br />However, I found the stories to be very practical in describing the concept of See, Feel, Change that is needed by all employees to really embrace the change emotionally and not just logically.  They have to want to change their own behaviors, not just for the project, but forever.  The story I could relate to the most was &quot;The Boss Goes to Switzerland&quot;.  I have seen this happen numerous times for others and myself.<br />This book has practical content that can be referred to over and over again...I will use this book each time a new change initiative gets underway.  Recommended for all business leaders.	2002-07-31

The author has worked with some of the best companies, boards and executives around...some have succeeded and others have failed.  Yet, his insight is one that focuses on accountability and frequent, frank evaluations of both roles: the board director and the CEO.  <br />I found the final chapters that focused on the Chairman/CEO evaluation to be insightful, detailed and organized to provide any director with the framework to ask the right questions.<br />I recommend this book now to all senior executives to read again, focusing on the evaluation process that your leader should be subject to.  I recommend this book even more to those board directors that face a responsibility to shareholders and employees, that they will oversight the senior leaders and hold them accountable to building businesses with integrity...not just providing the right numbers on a scorecard.	2002-07-26

That is no small feat with the depth and breadth of Churchill's life.  However, I found the book written in a very factual and dry manner, lacking an emotional tone that would make some of the key events in Churchill's life jump off of the page.<br />The author's background, enticed me to believe that I would encounter a very first hand account of many Churchill stories since Mr. Jenkins served the House of Commons in 1948 and later various ministry roles, including Chancellor of the Exchequer during the later years of Churchill's life.  What I did find is a well written chronology of the events in the subjects life, written with a sense of respect for Churchill's ability to survive a political life and contribute so much to the world.<br />Thus, going in I made a perception error in the style of writing and content that I expected, I still found the book to be a sound account of Churchill's remarkable life.  I recommed this book to all Churchill history readers.<br />I would recommend other books to provide more insight into why Churchill acted in key events such as: &quot; My Early Years&quot; by Winston S. Churchill and &quot;The Last Lion, Winston Churchill, Alone, 1932-1940&quot; by William Manchester.	2002-07-26

This was a fun and entertaining book.  Focused on innovation and how to unleash your abilities to be creative, this book provides insight into 10 Famous people that dramatically influenced the world with their ideas and actions.  <br />I will immediately say that I naturally enjoy learning from history, particularly from the people that influence history.  To understand why historical figures acted in difficult times, how they adapted, what aspects of their upbringing formed their thinking and how they influenced others to accept their thinking has always intrigued my mind.<br />The stories will not give you a full life biography on each person...just a synopsis of who the person is, what they did that was so revolutionary and how you can apply their actions to being innovative.<br />From Plato, Brunelleschi, Columbus, Copernicus, Elizabeth I, Shakespeare, Jefferson and Darwin to Gandhi and Einstein...each will challenge you to reflect on your own gifts and how you might see things differently.<br />I especially liked how the author provided with each story sections for personal reflection and excercises that allow you to share thoughts with others.<br />Even before I finished the book, I was already enjoying the discussions with my kids about their views on the subjects and quizzing their minds about how they would have handled the situations these great people were a part of.<br />I highly recommend this book, especially to those that are involved with consulting or facilitating others through innovation or creative expression in business.	2002-07-24

The practical experience from the authors provides a solid blueprint for both internal and external innovators to map out their proposed venture to evaluate the likelihood of success.  I frequently refer to the numerous examples while evaluating new business deals, both pre and post launch.<br />I also recommend the reader concentrate on the chapter, &quot;Battling Corporate Antibodies&quot;.  The greatest barrier is often from your own team, the &quot;middle-manager&quot; which will require much more time and effort to emotionally educate than is ever expected.  Excellent insight is provided in dealing with the numerous approval stages and cultural hurdles that a new venture proposal must overcome within a corporation to survive beyond just an idea.<br />I do recommend this book for those brave innovators within a corporation and the bravest, those outside the safe womb of a corporation seeking to build a new idea into a business.	2002-07-15

He provides the inspiration and can-do attitude that empowers people that they can make a difference.  He is so effective because he has done it.  He could have never changed his part of the Navy unless, his employees, unless he led them through the change himself.  He led from the front and backed up his employees.  He could have never pulled things off without having the courage to make mistakes and learn.  He provides excellent examples of managing up and down the organization...something every leader needs.  It is also a skill every employee wants to see in their leader.  It was refreshing to see Abrashoff apply his daily learnings to his work. Each time a new risk was taken, whether the risk was successful or not, the author applied the learnings for the next opportunity, readying his team to learn from their trials.<br />This book is easy to read and practical...a leadership guide that all leaders should read.

The two authors have obviously worked together before writing this book and have now collaborated on practical lessons learned that leaders should want to stay sharp on.  I have met Ram Charan at numerous meetings and found that his greatest strength is challenging people to think.  I do not always agree with his insights, but I do like how he makes me and the reader think about how they act as a leader.<br />Now I will tell you that I learned from Larry Bossidy's comments in the book.  I actually sought out his comments as the book went on.  Why?   Well, each and every section that he contributed was no nonsense, practical advice.  It appeared to me that his comments were straight from his thoughts, as if he were speaking.  Spontaneous and candid.  I made a list of take-away actions that I wanted to check myself on or apply in the future.<br />The basic principles of the book are simple:  identify the best people, give them clear objectives, challenge them to improve and check up on them frequently.  It sounds too simple...but the simple things that Bossidy mentions are the important aspects of the book.  Listening.  Writing follow-up letters outlining the expectations of the leaders previous day interactions with the boss.  Talking with people to find out for yourself what is going on, how people are being managed, what management is doing right and what they are doing wrong.<br />I found the advice from Bossidy the real key to the book.  I especially recommend this for all leaders that think execution is something that is delegated for others to do.  I also recommend this for any leader, no matter what size company, to validate the basics in their personal toolkit...are you \\"executing\\" the basics?	2002-06-26

I am always very interested in understanding the character development of leaders, especially the circumstances surrounding their education development and the life changing events of their lives.  The times in which he lived certainly contained the impactful circumstances, but I do not feel the book related those circumstances to who he is today in any lucid manner.  I found the memoir detached from who he is today, which should be a fascinating build up of a biography when read along with his other books.  My thoughts throughout the book where that the story flow could have been much more fun to read if he had collaborated with a writer that could have livened the prose up a bit.<br />If you have not read about Andy Grove before, then you will find this book an interesting story.  However, if you are looking for a deeper insight into Andy Grove today, you will find a much more enjoyable insight by reading his other books.  <br />I was dissappointed with this book, so I would recommend as alternatives that you should read:  Only the Paranoid Survive : How to Exploit the Crisis Points That Challenge Every Company and  Andrew S.

From the childhood health problems to the tragic loss of people close to him, a good understanding of the perseverance and stubborness to live life in a big way is illustrated to the reader.<br />I am constantly amazed at the breadth of education, travel and family experiences afforded to many of our past presidents in their childhood years.  Comparing the extent to which the Roosevelt parents constantly occupied their children's time in educational experiences to present day, I find equal activity today but less quality of learning.<br />People make history and certainly Theodore Roosevelt created a lot of history.

This is one of my favorite leadership books by two authors with whom I have a great deal of respect for their advice.  The premise of the book it that by looking at the entire business landscape affecting your clients, there are larger opportunities in which to solve the client's CEO issues beyond the immediate customer orders.  Written with real world examples, some of which were first hand consulting jobs by the authors, the examples are detailed and written so you can relate them to your own work.<br />I have applied these principles in my own professional work and find the concepts very useful in business growth development efforts. In almost every growth opportunity development session with employees, collegues and clients, the going in premise is that there is not enough budget or too limited a market, thus preventing us from pursuing a given opportunity.  Applying the author's concepts to creating the expanded view of the opportunity almost always proves to incite a bigger picture for everyone. <br />The book may require better book bindings because I refer back to it so often that I will one day wear out the bindings!<br />Read and Expand the Pond!  Highly Recommended.	2002-04-11

I read the original printing of this Robert Ludlum novel on a flight from London to Dallas and could not put it down.  I was exhausted when I got back for lack of sleep, but thrilled with the non-stop action that Ludlum provides.<br />After visiting many of the same locations that were written about in the novel, it was easy to picture the scenes in my mind.  But the real value of the book is the character development of Jason Bourne with the multiple twists and turns of the plot. A real page turner for even me...an avid non-fiction reader.<br />Bourne finds himself on a beach with amnesia...and must take the clues one by one to find out his true identity...and why assasins are chasing him.<br />I highly recommend this book for those that like intrigue and a good spy thriller.  The Bourne Supremacy is the sequel book...which is actually better than the Bourne Identity!	2002-04-11

Although written in a simple and obvious advice format, there are a lot of middle managers out there that still need these fundamentals also. I would recommend using this book as a required reading and discussion book with all first time leaders in your company.<br />Charan depicts the key issues of running a corporation to the same gut instincts of running a business in India...everyday cut throat competition for cash...turn it fast!<br />I also support his views on addressing frankly the leadership development issues of your employees. However, I did not think he was thorough enough in the coaching of employees section as his only examples were to fire those that struggled. One of the great challenges in managing leaders is putting them in developmental positions and giving them the tools/coaching to succeed. I find his recommendations lean to a failure in dealing with leaders that may have struggled without the necessary preparation or tools.<br />Overall, this primer book is a recommended book for my new leaders and I would recommend this as a light read on your next three hour business trip...	2002-04-11
US	53040105	R348FHECQOJV8I	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Very Interesting Biography...Overrated Account	This biography of John Adams was certainly needed in that Adams has influenced America in a multitude of ways that many Americans today never knew. Certainly overshadowed by the more famous George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, I found the character profile of Adams as an ordinary, yet well educated citizen to be a reluctant politician. The author depicts Adams as a simple farmer and loving husband...yet he spends most of his life away from the farm and away from his wife. The love affair and marriage are built up in a way that is hard to imagine the couple maintaining while being generally years and oceans apart from each other.<br />I was very impressed with Adams the man. He has been described here as a man of high integrity, moral principles, strong believer in God, a statesman, a patriot and a visionary in the formation of democracy and our education system. Certainly a man with a love for books, lots of books. He instilled that love for reading in his son, John Quincy which no doubt significantly influenced his educational and character development.<br />With so few biographies on John Adams with adequate research and references, I would still highly recommend the book for all those interested in revolutionary era history and biography. However, I would not characterize the style and flow of the biography as a fast-paced, enjoyable book as the author has over used his research to make his points. Certainly David McCullough is a extremely talented author, but not a 5-star level here.	2002-04-06

I gained more insight into the character and the influences that shaped his personality and thought processes than any other work.<br />I was especially pleased with the insight into his interactions with other up-and-coming military peers in the Mexican War and his personal development that occurred while in Mexico that shaped his future actions.<br />Very good insight also into his faith in God, his personal development as a Christian, his personal actions to live a strong Christian life and his remarkable openness to teach others about his God...no matter what racial background...something I am proud to discover in a Confederate leader.<br />Anyone contemplating a purchase...this is a lay-up decision.  You will be very happy with this choice.	2002-04-05

All of her descriptions of events were built around the people that made the key decisions or influenced the events to occur.<br />This Pulitzer Prize book is equally well researched on both of the book's characters, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.  In reading the book, you feel like you are actually living in the White House during the events leading up to and during the Depression and World War II.<br />The author is so thorough in the details gathered from her research from diaries and letters, that the book is not a fast read.  However it is a fascinating portrait of two extraordinary individuals that led our nation through extraordinary events and personally influenced historical change in the way we live as Americans that forever changed our fabric.<br />I highly recommend to any Franklin or Eleanor Roosevelt reader...through this work, you cannot understand one without knowing the other.	2002-04-04

Although I was familiar with the history of the Bataan death march, I was not familiar with the people behind the story.  Being familiar with the writing style of Hampton Sides from Outside Magazine, I expected an adventurous tale...I was not ready for the in-depth profiles of the people that captured my undivided reading attention.<br />The author does a very good job of keeping two stories going at the same time...the people in the prison camp and the rescue team marching on an all volunteer, suicidal mission to free the prisoners.  Flipping back and forth through the two on-going stories causes you to want to race to the final encounter...<br />Beyond the prisoners and the Ranger rescue team, there are other incredible civilian heroes that deserver their own record in history.  Bring a dictionary along...Hampton Sides will saturate the pages with enough infrequently used words to help you pass the SAT...again!  I highly recommend this book for those looking for more insight into the people than just a straight historical account.  Caution: this book should be rated R for violent depictions of war.	2002-04-04

You would not believe the bravery of everyone involved, from the actual racing teams to the rescue teams, not one person was left unphased by this experience.<br />I am not an active sailor now, but with some experience in racing with a crew on sailboats, I found the account of this true story gripping.  <br />Certainly, a fun book to read, even if you are not into sailing.  It may even convince you to never go open ocean sailing!	2002-04-04

What a legend.  Top Ten of any Old West History Reader	First I am from Texas.  That would normally bias me to any historical figure from Texas.  However, without a doubt this man did more in a lifetime to fill any biography.  As a Texas Ranger captain fighting Indians, fighting Mexican bandits, scouting for the US Army in the Mexican-American war, to California sheriff and land developer...everything is done in a big way in his life.  James Greer writes a biography that is historically-fact based...he doesn't have to make Jack Hays larger than life...he lived larger than life.<br />As an avid reader of biographies from the wild west...this is no history book review of a man...this is the best lawman book I have ever read.  This guy is now my number one wild west hero!<br />I highly recommend the book...you won't believe the bravery!	2002-04-04

However, he has written another very good book about the lives of a few key figures, building off the material previously written  from his other works.  Primarily focused on Robert E. Lee, I poured through  the book and enjoyed each chapter through the end.  I was disappointed with  the ending...because it ended.	2000-06-27

A historical review of the a lawman that &quot;cleaned up the town&quot; during the prohibition period, was feared by criminals throughout the  region of Northern Louisiana and died in the line of duty...a murder which  remains unsolved to this day!<br />If you like reading about tough, no  non-sense lawmen of the west or historical accounts of Texas Rangers, you  will really enjoy this book.  This man had character, integrity, and a  single-minded focus on upholding the law.  He usually worked alone, most  times outnumbered and rarely was outwitted by his adversaries. <br />This  should be a required reading for students in Louisiana schools...they  should revere and remember the heroes that help build their state.	2000-02-19

Accurate depictions of  the behind the scenes tactics of the key players of change. For those  change agents in today's Fortune 500 world, there is a great deal to learn  from the few in GM that are very good at corporate renewal.  The best book  I have read about the Jack Smith era of GM and how he got there.	1998-09-11
