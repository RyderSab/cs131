Someone once defined a classic as:  \\"A book many people talk about and few read.\\"  Well until recently I had put off reading this \\"Heinlein classic\\" and now that I have, I am greatly disappointed.  In a word, \\"yuck\\" <br /> <br />Is it actually Science Fiction or not?  I could not care any less!  I found the book about as satisfying as watching old Bullwinkle and Rocky shows.  It is so stuck in the late 1950s to early 1960s as to be almost ironically funny, almost.  There is nothing I can say positive about Stranger in a Strange Land except that I am glad I put off reading it for years.   <br /> <br />The books characters are flat and at best straw men.  The female characters are ridiculous and nothing like any real woman I have ever encountered.  The flow and consistency of the book is poor.  It is sexist.  It is stupid.  It mocks everything while saying nothing.  The cultural satire is either so thick as to be gagging (as in the casinos in the religious worship houses) or is so waffling as to be meaningless. The whole `water brother' concept left me feeling empty.  <br /> <br />There are many elements that I found sleazy and insulting.  It read in some points like Heinlein was trying to slip smut past a censor.   The intimacies which are implied just remind me of the so-called \\"free love\\" movements from the 60s.  In a future society, one can hope for at least some self respect and restraint.  <br /> <br />I really do like many of Heinlein's novels:  Tunnel in the Sky or Time for the Stars or Starship Troopers or Orphans in the Sky.  If you like these which are often called \\"juveniles\\" then you may not like Stranger in a Strange Land.      <br /> <br />My advice on Heinlein's works, if it is written prior to 1960 it might be worth the time.  Most of his work after 1960 or so is junk.   <br />	2005-09-29

Would you want to see it?  What is there?  How would your soul look to earthly eyes?  How would someone else's soul appear?  Well, that is the basic premise behind \\"The Presence.\\"  Now add the fact that that new technology is in the hands of a madman who has lured unsuspecting people to a \\"mountain retreat\\" center.   <br />      \\"The Presence\\" is a great novel.  It is not so much a sequel as it is another story in the life of Luke, David and Nubee and other characters first encountered in \\"Soul Tracker.\\"  Each novel can easily stand on its own.  <br />      The action is intense at times and as usual Bill Myers' characters are very well developed.  The story unfolds in very unpredictable fashion.  Without adding any spoilers to this review, be advised that you will ponder this book for a long while after reading it.  Just consider, what would God do about that new technology which peers into the spiritual rhelm?   <br />      If you have enjoyed any of Bill Myers' previous books you will not be disappointed.  If you are new to Bill Myers books you are in for a great treat!  Be sure to read Eli! <br />	2005-09-27
US	36595550	R2EPTH8JBQ6EJ1	0966275705	867619041	Conflict of Ages	Books	1	0	0	N	N	Some overviews of history, but not much depth, and a troubling undercurrent	In the booklet, \\"The Conflict of Ages.\\"  I was really, really disappointed.   I expected more depth and convincing argumentation.  The author makes broad and sweeping claims but sometimes they are not really accurate.   On page 5 he states, \\"The power of each of these secular governments is held by a minority...\\"  Yet he fails to see much difference between a totalitarian government and a democracy.  There is a vast difference.     In the section on \\"The Vocation of a Soldier\\" he again makes general claims which can not be supported by facts.  He states, \\"All the branches of the military have the common purpose of killing...\\" This is wrong.  The medical services in the military do not have the purpose of killing.  He is just misinformed.  In this section of the booklet, the author fails to even apply the consequences of the fall and original sin. His work is very lacking theologically.       The author claims the conflict of the ages is some fight between secular government and that of a \\"spiritual kingdom.\\"  Yet, the true fight is between good and evil.  He states very clearly on page 9 \\"There will never be a war to end war.\\"  This is contrary to the teachings in Revelation.   This work ignores Revelation sompletely.  He does obliquely mentions Isaiah, Micah and Zechariah, yet misses entirely the book of Revelation.  If, as he proposes, the spiritual kingdom came with Jesus incarnation, why do wars continue?  This author's end times omission is a glaring flaw in his agenda and philosophy.  He writes, \\"Wars will cease to exist in the kingdom of the messiah.\\"  Yet, he fails to mention anything about the reality of spiritual warfare.  This booklet never considers Satan, demons, or their reality.  The short section on \\"The Real War\\" was pathetic.     This author states \\"Capital punishment for a capital crime is justice and is classified separately from military combat.\\"  Why does he say that?  He gives no support for his statement.  It seems that personal killing by states, against one individual is acceptable to him, but a state holding another state responsible for its crimes is not.  Huh?  That is but one of many illogical assumptions.   But it all falls in line with this work's limited understanding of governments and how power in some countries is derived from the people.       This author makes statements on how God used Israel to punish other nations.  That is accurate.  Yet, the work falls apart with application to the modern world.  It seems to say that God used governmental leaders back then, but does not do so today.  He says this in spite of Romans 13.  The author fails to write about the application to today of  the incidents where Jesus cleaned the temple.  He supposes that 'Jesus would not have defended himself if he had been attacked.'  Pure speculation, but perhaps in the act itself Jesus was defending himself?  Jesus used a whip of cords and the Bible does not say he failed to strike any humans.  The record says Jesus drove them all out.  That is hardly the act of a pacifist.  Also Jesus is seen defending himself and Christians in the book of Revelation, yet again, this work ignores Revelation entirely.     The author's overview of history is fairly accurate, yet very limited.  The author states on page 21 \\"None of the Messianic Jews joined the Jewish revolutionaries or took up arms...\\"  How does he know?  Did he interview each and every one?  Impossible.  These kinds of broad statements strain the author's credibility.  Later in his work he writes, \\"Some Christians succumbed to the pressure of the military and accepted service.\\"  So is he contradicting himself again?  How does he know they 'succumbed to military pressure'?  Perhaps they were led by the Holy Spirit to enter into military service?  Can he read their minds and hearts?        The author uses nebulous words often in his historical review sections.  Perhaps because the history is not a clear as he want to portray it?  He writes \\"...inclines toward pacifism\\" about Clement.  How unclear is that?  By reading George Washington's words one could say \\"he inclines toward pacifism.\\"  Every Christian I know wants to see peace and harmony.  So I could say \\"Every Christian I know inclines toward pacifism.\\"      The review of Constantine is biased and jaded.  He seems to be able to claim to have a better understanding of Constantine's vision than Constantine had.  That is awfully high arrogance.  Can this author know what God intended when he sent that vision?  Was it his vision or was it for Constantine?  I think Constantine would have a better understanding of what it meant than this author.  The author makes the statement \\"Constantine himself had no personal virtues or morality to speak of...\\"  How can he know?  Again he seems to speak for God.  That kind of judgment is up to God.     The author never addresses the questions about police action or civil unrest.  He makes an odd call against social action and protest, but it is tough to know why he did that.      In conclusion, I found a troubling element in this work.  The author seem to imply that \\"true Christians\\" can not be in the military.  So to him, is military service an unforgivable sin?  Is it a sin if that is where God has called a certain man or woman?  How about those who become born again in the trench?  Is that person a \\"true Christian\\"    A better book on this subject is \\"War: Four Christian Views\\" edited by Robert Clouse.	2005-09-16

It is not written in a style that connects with readers.  There is only limited flow of ideas and it is very choppy.  Somewhere in the text is an excellent book with great concepts describing a young earth and the truth of creation by God.     <br />      Unfortunately getting at the information and materials is hindered by the difficult writing style.  The author references many other works but does not make his own points clearly.  I was reminded of hearing one side of a telephone call.  It just is hard to comprehend or follow the author's trains of thought.  Many of the referenced works are obscure and difficult to obtain for comparison and this makes it even more complicated to track with the author's conclusions.   <br />      Some parts read as Bible commentary, others as apologetics, and still other parts do not really fit any genre.  While I agree with his exposure of the fallacy of the theory of evolution, he grinds the anti-evolution axe way too much, and he goes off on tangents that do not pertain to the topics at hand.  Sometimes he does not ever wonder back from those distractions.  He would have been much more effective had he just presented his concepts and shown the scientific facts that support the truth of creation.   <br />     The author often writes that he will cover a subject later, or states it has already been covered elsewhere, but I had trouble finding where anything was covered in a clear and understandable way.  While there are jems of ideas scattered throughout the text, it is labor to find them.  There are many photos, drawings and charts, some of which are not very useful as they are in small font and are not explained properly.  Perhaps had the author used a good editor he could have streamlined and refined the excellent information that is here and then presented it in a more coherent manner.   <br />      Overall I was disappointed, for the era of Noah to Abram is understudied and misunderstood.  I was hoping for a light to shine on that era, but sadly the book \\"Noah to Abram\\" does not illuminate much. <br />	2005-06-22

These 14 tales vary dramatically in locale and environment, but do have an interesting connection.  The short stories are by different authors and this adds to the overall enjoyment of the collection.  Excellent writers with different styles gives this book flavor!  Some of the authors were new to me, but I will now search out their longer works.  Indeed, this is short science fiction at its best.  Readers should relate well to at least a few of the authors and tales, if not to all of them.  Many of the characters described are engaging. <br /> <br />I found the \\"The Science Behind the Story\\" segment in some of the short very interesting.  Also there is the added bonus of spiritual content that often is so lacking in ordinary sci fi.  After all, Christianity has been around for two thousand years, it is only reasonable to assume that as humans spread out from our home world, we will bring Christianity along with us. I must admit to reading the \\"About the contributors\\" and being surprised by all the Ph.D.s and high tech science (NASA etc...) backgrounds of the authors.  A last thought, it really is too bad Ray Bradbury's short story \\"The Man\\" was not included.  While that tale long ago inspired Michael Carroll, it really would have fit in nicely with these other great stories.	2005-03-08

This book was a rather sordid and ugly look at genders and relationships.  Heinlein is so different here than in his good books (Tunnel in the Sky, Starship Troopers, Door into Summer, or Orphans of the Sky) that I wondered who actually wrote this awful work.  It seems obsessed with sleezy gender roles and is quite anti-woman. The basic premise is what would happen with a man's brain in a female body.  Maybe a good concept, but it is terrible in application here.  I just hated this book. I was appalled at some of the slams women take in this work. Please consider avoiding this work.  Perhaps every writer deserves some grace, but this work is almost beyond redemption.  Maybe Heinlein was ill while writing this, or maybe his editor was on drugs?	2005-03-04

It is a similar to Tunnel in the Sky and Time for the Stars in style.  Originally penned in 1940s so it is in the author's best period.  As the other reviews have stated it covers a lost colony ship and the survivors.  It is not a long work, but it is great.  If you like Orphans of the Sky you may want to read \\"The World and Thorinn\\" by Damon Knight.  It is a similar concept and is also well done.	2005-02-22

Quency Gardner has written a book that covers a wide range of topics.  Among these topics are relationships, worship, witnessing, churches, sin, suffering, betrayal and many others.  Through all these topics the author applies biblical principles and concepts.  It is clear that he writes from a devoted heart and is striving for knowing Jesus and for helping others to love our Savior as he so obviously does.  The author's genuine faith and commitment to God are to be commended.   He often shares personal stories which are very touching.  Scattered among the chapters is original poetry.  Love is a consistent theme through all the chapters and this is a strong point of his work.  The author does not avoid the tough topics such as personal betrayal or national tragedy.  Many readers will relate to the shared feelings and emotions. Often this work makes insightful and helpful comments about the deeper meanings in the Bible.  There are readers who will be blessed by this work.  \\"Knowing Jesus\\" is diminished by frequent grammatical irregularities.  At times this distracts from the points the author tries to make.  The author also uses the King James Version of the Bible almost exclusively.  This also makes reading less smooth, as the scripture passages presented are in old style English.  The author takes time to rephrase or paraphrase the King James language which could have nearly entirely been avoided had he more often used the New Revised Standard Version or the New International Version.  Readers who use the King James Version for their personal study will be better suited to gain edification from this work than are those who use modern translations.  Overall, \\"Knowing Jesus\\" is clearly a labor of love.   <br />	2004-11-29

Matthew Bridger is President of the United States and he faces many severe situations.  Terrorist strikes have killed thousands of US citizens on US soil.  International stress is huge, and suddenly oil supplies are disrupted.  Politicians are moving against the president.  How will President Bridger deal with this?  Interweaved and well told is the story about Bryson Lawe a Secret Service Agent.  Exciting story lines and very believable situations.  Superb secondary characters.  Some of the cast of characters are sinister and the supernatural elements are well done by Johnson.  One character, Randall Sullivan believes that after he survives a terrorist attack he can now communicate with the dead, but just who is in control in these encounters?   In some ways \\"A Form of Godliness\\" is written in the same genre as \\"1984\\" or \\"Brave New World\\" in that Shane Johnson looks at current situations and follows them to their logical and unnerving conclusions.  The descriptions of events and the detailed way Johnson writes paints vivid and thought provoking images.  Johnson also has great dialogue and the story flows smoothly.  I had trouble putting the book down.  The cliff hanger ending leaves me eagerly awaiting Shane Johnson's next book!	2004-09-09

Not too much science as to feel like a lecture, and enough to seem very realistic.  The story is great and poses many questions.  What if that booster engine just would not fire?  What if you were stranded on the moon?  How would you deal with being the astronaut who had to return without his buddies?  These are all examined and the book is really a page turner.

You probably think right away of some primative society: wrong!  Antediluvian sets the Noah story in a high-tech world where much of the solar system has been colonized.  In that world, Noah's family is a ruling dynasty of the Solar Union, the King Priest and his family.  This family governs the warmer inner planets while the Outer World Federation controls the worlds from Jupiter outward.  All these outer world people live in cities under domes, and they long for a &quot;warm world.&quot;  Thus a huge war begins.  The characters are really rather well developed and the story is engaging.  There are high tech elements and science fiction style equipment, but they do not dominate the book.  Instead the human interactions are where this author shines.  The book is fairly accurate to the spirit of the Genesis accounts, but is not a Bible study, although God (Adam's God) does make some appearences in the story.  Indeed, I found this book to be a good read and worth the money.	2004-06-24

It could have been better done without the simplisticly crude language, which to me is just sloppy writing to develop a character in a certain way.	2002-11-16

I read it aloud to my 3rd grade daughter and together we laughed and had a great time.  It is written from the first person (dog)adds much to the story.  Hank (the cowdog) has attitude, faces evils, and learns much about himself and his role as \\"head of ranch security.\\"  Only one caution is needed, Hank the Cowdog does not use proper English (often using \\"them\\" in place of \\"those\\" which is a personal irritation of mine) and his spelling is sometimes poor, but these are done in a humorous way and add flavor to the story.	2002-11-03
US	36595550	R3A94T862SSQBV	0310218039	810531498	Eli	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Great and thought provoking	This is a story that ponders what would it have been like had Jesus Christ waited to come to earth until the 20th century.  The book is very well written and engaging.  One needs to suspend a logical rationality to accept the premise.  For indeed, the world would be far worse than Myers describes had the Christian influence been absent for the past 2000 years.  Nonetheless, the story is great.  Those who are familiar with the life of Jesus will see the savior in a new light.  The text is never irreverent, yet is very interesting and contemplative, in a great prose fashion.  Truly a book worth the money.	2002-11-03

He (and his stuffed toy Chaser) are at the center of a well written and engaging story.<br /><br />At times it feels like a murder mystery, and at other times like a science class.  Nonetheless it all fits together in a very entertaining package.  The main evil characters are deluded fanatics who have no idea about genuine Christianity, but rather are religious nuts.  Indeed, there are too many corrupt people in church!  Will probably offend those who believe in a young earth, or those not open to science concepts or possibilities.<br /><br />Beware, you may think that you know where this story is headed, but there are unexpected twists and turns.  It held my attenton right down to the end.  Good reading.	2002-10-14

If you are considering pursuing a degree through non-traditional means (internet or correspondence) then this book is a must.

This is a book that I heard about when I was young and never read until just recently. Yellow Eyes is a cougar, and has adventures growing up.  I used it as summer reading for my children.  We sat together and I read the book to them, chapter by chapter.  We then discussed all that we read.  Reading this book is truly a moving experience as Yellow Eyes faced many dangers and some unexpected twists and turns.  The writing is superb and the story development is excellent.  If you are a fan of Avi and Poppy and Rye or Ereth books, this is for you!	2002-06-23

Parents with young children would do well to read this book to them.  It is the story of a young bull (Ferdinand) who learns to stay true to his own unique self.  While all the other bulls all want to be mean and fierce, Ferdinand instead is a gentle and loving soul.  Yet the situation comes where people try to force Ferdinand to comply.  Ferdinand is taken to fight in the bull fights!  Will he be faithful to himself, or will he go along with the crowds?  Yes, there are deep morality questions and ethics here)  Indeed, both parents and children will be touched by the timeless message of hope and strength that is Ferdinand.  It truly is a book that children need to know and model.	2002-06-09

A real anxiety buster!!!  The background music is sweet and mellow and the words of Louise Hay are very encouraging.  On one side you hear her gentle yet strong voice giving positive feedback.  On the other side is the music with just subliminal messages.  I highly recommend this tape for anyone who needs to find personal peace and a place of quiet refreshment.	2002-06-07
