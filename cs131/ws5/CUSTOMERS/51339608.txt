Her writing allows the reader to enter her mind. It's so honest, so raw.

Normally I don't get into gardening books...I'm a sucker for the pictures, but find the text boring.<br /><br />This book however has been so fun to read -- and, yes the pictures are beautiful. It helps create a garden for each season, and it shows photos from the same garden each season. I've just planted based on some ideas in this book, so I guess I'll need to report back how it works out.	2005-04-05

So, if you are considering natural birth (or just want to know more in case), read on.<br /><br />This book is like a guide, but most of it seems totally foreign (even after reading) if you are in your first pregnancy. How can you REALLY know what its going to feel like to give birth, and try to \\"read up\\" on it? You don't. No matter how many books you read, you simply don't know until you go through it.<br /><br />Having said that, you (and your partner) can learn tools, tactics, and ideas on how to achieve a natural birth by reading this book. One misconception that I had was that I would `remember' all of my feelings, but when you are knee-deep in labor there isn't much time to remember. Your partner, however, can help guide you, and if he or she reads this book too, they will have ideas. When I walked into the hospital I clenched up; I was afraid, and the fear overwhelmed me. It IS painful to give birth, and it IS hard to maintain your own sense of dignity/integrity in a mainstream hospital. In the United States many hospitals follow formula birth = IV, monitor, epidural, controlled pushing, baby. Mention you don't want the IV, and suddenly you are in conflict with the person who is there to take care of you - the nurse.  (My husband brought StarBucks Gift cards and they certainly sweetened up our nurses).<br /><br />Ultimately what I took from this book is not how I could have a natural childbirth, how I could control what happens in a hospital birth, how I could cope with pain, but rather it was how I could embrace the experience, whatever it may be. To me Birthing From Within means really listening to your own story, your own art, your own family and trying to take steps that are best for your baby and yourself. There is no formula. There is no one right way.<br /><br />Side note: Birthing From Within also has a website with an excellent network of doulas. If your considering natural birth in a hospital, take a moment to consider a birthing doula./> <br />Side note: Birthing From Within also has a website with an excellent network of doulas.

I admit the title of this book turned me off - made me feel like I was reading a cheap novel, not literature. But the stories of these women and their friendship became a something I looked forward to each evening; what is the next twist, what is the next phase of their lives.<br /><br />It its quite a feat for author to cover decades of friendship, and at times I felt like I was seeing old friends and we were going through 'catch up' mode, hear about what is happening with all the kids. This get tedious, and I think distracts from the heart of the story.<br /><br />If your looking for a nice long story where you can be come engrossed in other people's lives, this is it.	2004-12-12

It's a fast read and inspired me to learn more about contemporary Colombia. Her story is amazing, and her matter-of-fact manner of telling it is refreshing.<br />My only critique is that the story seemed rushed, and felt a bit shallow at times when the narrator rushed through facts. She glossed over certain periods, and at times characterized others (such as the other former female presidential candidate) in a strong, negative fashion but then didn't explain in detail. This made me question her factual presentation at times.	2002-09-24

And to have it told by Garcia Marquez.<br />This is the true story of a series of kidnappings that took place in Colombia a decade ago.

Garcia Marquez tells the story from various of the kidnappers perspective, and he keeps it organized so the reader can follow along and understand what is happening to each of the victims, their families, etc.<br />This is a must ready for anyone interested in Colombia, Latin America, or contemporary issues in general.

It's very indepth, at times it feels like maybe Oppenheimer doesn't have all the information to tell the story, but he sure tells a lot of it.  It's also not overly biased, like many books about recent Mexican history. Oppenheimer does a great job of setting the scene, explaining who is who, and helping the reader get their arms around all the different factions that make for a volatile social environment in Mexico.  I also read &quot;Castro's Final Hour&quot; which was informative, but not as good (especially since the &quot;final hour&quot; was somewhere in the early nineties, and now it's 2001).  I'd love to read more of Oppenheimer.	2001-12-14

What I found fascinating about this book - apart from the story itself, which is fascinating - is Bowden's ability to tell the story in such a way that at times I actually sympathized for Pablo, and other times hated him. His telling of a story that is somewhat farcical and unreal at times (i.e. shutting down all usage of cell phones in Medellin, or the unending killing of so many innocent people) was very real.<br />It's a page turner, and makes me want to learn more about how the demand for drugs will always inspire supply, which boggles my mind as to why the US is spending so much money attacking supply. The problem is at home.	2001-12-12

I become completely engrossed in Alvarez' writing. She traverses through the lives of Salome, and Camilla (Salome's daughter) in parallel stories. &quot;I merely write what we all know to be true,&quot; is one of Salome's responses to others commenting on her poetry. I think Alveraz does this as well -- whether or not the actual story is true, she depicts ordeals that we all go through<br />What I really love is that this novel combines the histories of Dominican Republic, a bit of Haiti, Cuba and the US. I'll be back when I finish it with my final review, but for now I give it a big thumbs up.<br />****<br />Back, having completed the novel. Read it.	2001-08-10

The intertwining of stories, past and present, between sisters daughters and so on makes for a book full of good ingredients. I especially loved how Constancia, one of the sisters who starts a line of beauty products, still mixes her own remedies for her skin and doesn't use the products she produces.

But it is so very worth reading, and probably re-reading throughout your life.  I had the pleasure of listening to Alicia Partnoy speak about this book and her voice is so soft and delicate compared to the strength of her words. After reading the book, I characterized her as a woman of such power (she had to have so much courage to withstand the torture); and in person she reminded me that she is simply human, having endured a terrible time of history both personally and for Argentina in general, and she carries that history with her throughout her life.  While there are various good books about &quot;disappearance&quot; and exile with relation to Latin America, this one tops the lists.	2001-02-26

And, there has yet to be Castro's &quot;final hour&quot; eight years after this book has been published.
