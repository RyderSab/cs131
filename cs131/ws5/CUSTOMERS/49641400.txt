I have thoroughly enjoyed Sylvia's other CDs and found them informative and enjoyable. This one begins with a \\"psychic comedy routine\\" which I found profoundly unhelpful. If I wanted comedy, there are plenty of places I could have purchased it. It then goes abruptly into a short guided meditation, and ends with a question and answer session, with personal questions from the audience. Frankly, it was not worth the money or the time unless you want something very light and \\"fluffy\\".  Go to some of her other works.	2005-08-17

I remember receiving a tape of her revelation when it first came out a number of years ago. This is the revelation that won't go away, though it should. When I first heard her revelation, it was the proverbial fingernails on a blackboard in my spirit. Instead of directing us to the love of God, it directs us to fear of hell. Incidentally, hell is exegetically very questionable. Her vision is more a reframing of Dante by an overactive imagination. My pastor had been careful to train us in discernment, and I am grateful. The exercise of discernment meant that, after listening to her tape I did two things: (1)I made sure my children did NOT hear it, and (2) I destroyed the tape.  Save your money and spend it on something which will lead to spiritual growth, not something which will drag you down into its own little spiritual pit.  Remember, as you evaluate any revelation, does it uplift and glorify God? If it doesn't, run the other direction.  I guarantee, this doesn't.	2005-07-27

I cringed every time I heard this, because setting goals is NOT my style.  Then this lovely book came along and changed the way I approached patient care planning with the patient and the way I approached planning in my own life.<br /><br />  We were always taught to work with patients to set goals for their care. And, for years, I had seen a blank curtain come down over eyes and faces when I started talking about goals. Once I understood the principles in this book, I started changing my approach and even just my words, so that my predominantly problem-solver patients were not intimidated or put off.  What an improvement.<br /><br />  This book has not received the ongoing attention it merits, but I recommend to you that you read it and put it into practice.  Its testimony is in significantly more effective nursing care planning with my patients. If my wide variety of patients generally respond better with the application of Bobb Biehl's principles, it will no doubt work in any other setting where you interact in planning with people. Do not knock this book until you have tried Biehl's principles in actual practice.	2005-05-11

Overall, it is just another autobiography, badly in need of a good editor to bring some fluiditiy.  While I'm sure she finds it fascinating (it's her life--she should!), I found it a rather dull read.  You might find it interesting and satisfying if you are very new to reincarnation and the paranormal.  Otherwise, save your money.	2005-01-28

Ed Smith gets right down to the basics, gives proportions and directions for making many different herbal compounds for a variety of ailments.  He gives the indications and contraindications, the action and how to give the compound.  Period.  No chatty stories or unnecessary verbiage.

I found her characterizations vivid, her presentation of plot initially clear.  She ultimately presents the fifth child as a villian, even prenatally, and builds on that.  It seems, however, that once she gets her young antagonist well into grade school, she really doesn't know where to go from there.  The story and behavior of the boy become tiresomely predictable and repetitive.  In her endeavor to show the disintegration of the family around the mother's determination to raise her aberrant son, she starts out energetically, but seems to tire of her theme, or else to run out of ways to successfully conclude her story (not to be confused with a \\"happy ending\\", please understand).<br /><br />  My feeling about this book is rather like a nagging headache, now relieved, but unpleasantly remembered.  I am not encouraged to sample her other works.	2005-01-19

As one fairly conversant with the doctrines of reincarnation and recognizing this book was written over 20 years ago, my concerns are as fresh as they would have been when the book was first available:  (1) a total lack of objectivity. Dr. Goldberg has his own spiritual beliefs about reincarnation and things surrounding reincarnation, and he teaches and preaches from that viewpoint. Unfortunately, he fails to make it clear that he is teaching his personal dogma. (2)He is quick to condemn.  I was particularly struck by his blanket condemnation of all witchcraft, all covens, and by extension, all magical practices.  This bespeaks ignorance of the subject and comes from a fairly narrow view, much as if I were to give a blanket condemnation of Christianity.  Personally, I believe Christianity to be far more dangerous, but I recognize that this is opinion, and don't preach it as fact.  (3) Overall, I found his research and techniques very disorganized.  To me, this is rather sad for an accomplished hypnotist, because it diminishes his effectiveness.  Both in his writing and reporting, and in his interviews, I felt he<br /><br />could greatly improve both interview and writing style by having a better idea of where he is going and the cues given by subjects.<br /><br />  Personally, Dr. Goldberg is not a practitioner I would select to help me with regression or progression, based on my experience with this book. There are other authors dealing with the subject.  I would direct the interested reader to a more solid author, such as Brian Weiss.	2004-11-20

In presenting the struggles of Sheila Katz as she deals with the homosexuality of her daughter, and the reactions of her husband, family, and friends, Schwab uses a variety of situations and characters and some delightfully funny happenings.  The book doesn't stop at dealing with the sexuality of Sheila's daughter.  It takes a hard look at the fluid and sometimes surprising sexual reactions we find in ourselves when we look deep enough.  Schwab also takes careful and loving aim at the American cruelty towards those carrying extra weight and deals with the effects it has on the individual as well. Schwab demonstrates a remarkable understanding of human nature, with all its foibles and faults, draws her characters with real clarity--something too few authors do--and builds a story filled with humor, fun, and a little suspense.<br /><br />  The book starts slow, and the first few pages are a little pedantic.  However, once the story kicks in, which it does fairly quickly, there's no looking back--you're hooked and avidly reading till the end.  I recommend this book especially for those dealing with any gay family member, or for a gay trying to understand family reactions.  An excellent book.  This is Schwab's second, and I'll definitely be looking forward to a third!	2004-10-25

One could have appropriately, but less titilatingly, retitled the book \\"Unions in Pre-Modern Europe\\", since his study was fairly balanced between two-sex and same-sex unions.  It is certainly an eye-opener for those of the \\"traditional\\" marriage hue and cry.  \\"Traditional\\" marriage as we see it today was unknown until the late middle ages, although that sort of union among same-sex couples was known from the earliest.  The church did not recognize marriage as a sacrament until about 800 years ago.  Those today who speak of traditional marriage need to read their history to know whereof they speak.  I found his writing immensely readable and enjoyable.  Although I have not yet read his first work, it is certainly now on my list.	2004-04-18

I would have given the book 5 stars, but there are flaws:  occasional jumps in events, costing some fluidity, and a slow start that really doesn't &quot;grab&quot; you.  That being said, Ohio captures in a profound way the internal search and stuggle so much a part of many young, new  lesbians' lives.  She has a grasp of the essentials stuggled with by this group, something about which the professional reviewer is obviously ignorant.  The depth and impact of these essentials may be lost on one who has no point of reference, but are exquisitely captured and conveyed by the author, who is obviously intimate with her subject matter.	2004-02-08

I found it mildly amusing and somewhat contrived.  The heroine is believable only if you place her age in her early 20s.  The characters are shallow, and the reader is left knowing almost nothing about them except their sexual orientation.  This book was given to me.  Having read it, I would not recommend it for purchase.  There is a lot of excellent lesbian/gay fiction out there.  Only when you've finished many of them--fiction and non-fiction--would I recommend picking up this volume.	2003-12-24

While attempting to impose their own religious and value system on the nation as a whole, the authors continue to press their beliefs and values on everyone else.  It is sad that they would deny civil (not religious, civil) rights to any group because they do not fit their viewpoint.<br />At this time, if the religious right wishes to call homosexuality a choice (which it is not), and deny civil rights protections for that &quot;choice&quot;, ethically they must also work vigorously to remove civil rights protections based upon marital status--also a &quot;choice&quot;!	2003-10-19

What I found was a book with overall balance, an excellent general source of information.  I would recommend this book highly to heterosexuals, especially family members striving to deal with the homosexuality of a loved one.  I would recommend it to the lesbian or gay seeking a better, broad-based understanding of themselves, their history, and the things which shape and influence them.  Above all, I would recommend it to the person or group harboring an antihomosexual prejudice, be it from religious, cultural, or personal beliefs.<br />There are some criticisms of the book:  his treatment of lesbianism and the particular issues affecting gay women is, for the most part, shallow.  Granted, there is not as much material available, but there is more than he utilized.  Whether from a desire not to offend or from other motivations, his record of the last 30 years of gay history is shallow, as is the discussion of groups vigorously opposing homosexuals, such as the \\"religious right\\".  It would not have been difficult to employ more depth, particularly since these things impact and will continue to affect the civil rights, health, and well-being of the literally millions of homosexual women and men in this country.  Greater stress on what is happening today is needed.  The theological issues impacting the civil rights of the entire gay community are not really addressed, although the scholarship which leads to persecution of the gay community by religious groups is profoundly flawed and resource materials readily available.<br />These criticisms being understood, I would nevertheless highly recommend this book to anyone, regardless of sexual orientation, as a basic work which should be in any balanced library.	2003-10-14

David Marcus has put together a collection of 17 short stories by as many authors, and they are generally well crafted and good reading.  That being said, to call all but a handful of these stories \\"gay\\" or \\"lesbian\\" is an extreme reach, and one which I, for the most part, could not make, even allowing for the repressive conditions gays and lesbians frequently endure in Ireland (and which I hope are improving).  It wasn't until \\"Introducing Nessa\\", the 11th story, that I found the first which truly could be said to be a gay or lesbian story, rather than a schoolboy dalliance or an interlude in an otherwise heterosexual life.  If you enjoy stories of boyhood shenanigans, or general short stories, this is a good collection.  If you are looking for gay and lesbian short stories, you will not find more than five or six of the 17 which qualify, however well written the lot may be.  I enjoyed it for general reading, but since I was looking for gay and lesbian literature, I was disappointed at the dearth of genuine gay and lesbian stories.	2003-09-11

This book is simply another in his series.  He pulls together unrelated pieces of information, connects dots in convoluted fashion (without substantiation)and--voila!--conspiracy!  Having also been on both sides of the fundamentalist/new age debate, I have to say that, if there is a conspiracy anywhere, it is with the fundamentalist/religious right, which I personally observed while in that movement.  Nowhere does that exist in the extremely loosely knit new age community--they are simply too diverse, too independent, and too unorganized to fit Mr. Marrs' conspiracies. Further, a check of his references show they are limited, and citations in text are completely lacking.  If we are to follow his lead, we can pull Sacajewea from the top of the US Capitol, and pull the Statue of Liberty from New York Harbor. [pp211-212]  Mr. Marrs believes they are both statues of the \\"Goddess of Reason\\" designed to poison our minds and country!  His books are amusing, but please don't take them as factual or reliable.  They wouldn't pass in a freshman research course.	2003-06-24

Jeanette Winterson demonstrates a brilliant understanding of this confusion and the tensions created before and after breaking free from that strange little world.  Her portrayal of the dilemmas and the breaking free is superbly done.  On the flip side, I can understand how those who have not been on the inside of fundamental/evangelical Christianity (and by this I mean your standard &quot;religious right&quot;)and come out might have difficulty fully appreciating the portrayals in this book.  Anyone coming out of a narrow, insular group and turning to a more &quot;normal&quot; society, especially as a lesbian, is likely to go through the kinds of turmoil so ably portrayed in this book.	2003-04-27

Deeply erotic, it touches every conceivable permutation of slave/owner and bondage/discipline fantasy that any individual could conceive of, short of absolute brutality and injury.  To Ann Rice's credit, by the third book, she does develop some new twists (if you last that long--I barely did, because I was getting bored with the endless permutations on the same theme), and the ending of the third book is something of a surprise.  This Trilogy is quite a departure from her vampire books.  The writing is technically good, but I found the series overall repetitious and not worth the time.  I read all three, ultimately, to be able to say that I had.  I certainly wouldn't do it again.  I then turned around and sold the set on Amazon!	2003-03-30

It gives a once-over-lightly on the basic issues, but Mr. Morey lacks depth in his understanding of reincarnation, which is evident from the first.  He presents only the standard &quot;party line&quot; with respect to a scriptural understanding, and does not take any in-depth look at the serious questions of textual criticism , nor the historical disagreements which antedate the fourth century AD, all of which are serious issues in this matter.  If you wish a quick, one-sided look at the issue, this will be helpful.  If you want a look at the issue from all sides, don't waste your time.	2003-01-03

If it seems at times that he is picking on few passages, it is because the issue is not widely addressed in Scripture, nor does Scripture begin to have the approach found in today's church, be it fundamental, Catholic, or evangelical.

In fact, I found problems with the book, and one strong suit.<br />The strong suit was an interesting story line.  The story line was  well put together, easy to follow, interesting, and the conclusion was  satisfactory.<br />On the down side, the actual sub/dom and bdsm exploration  was shallow and poorly done.  This book is not really about lesbian bdsm,  even in exploration.  It is a vehicle for &quot;vanilla&quot; lesbian sex  (with no condemnation of that!), and there is a superabundance of that.  If  you are looking for bdsm fiction, however, you will find this book very  disappointing.<br />As far as the lesbian sex goes, there is variety in the  numbers of players (one, two, three), but the descriptions largely sound  like carbon copies.<br />Another difficulty rests with the shallowness of  her characterizations.  There is a flatness to them which is disappointing.  This work would be greatly improved with more fully drawn  characters.<br />Perhaps I have been spoiled by authors such as Pat Califia,  but unless you want the lightest of lightweight lesbian bdsm, this book is  not one I would recommend.	2000-07-22
