An excellent addition to books on careers. The book has a whole section on career identity. This is useful as most of us identify ourselves by our career identity rather than our personal characteristics, family background or origins from the part of the world we come from. Another section deals with managing emotions in the context of career change. Ultimately, it is indeed a book not only for career counsellors but also for any career hunter or someone who has been affected by redundancies! Some very useful and helpful ideas to re-invent yourself and your career. A book that fills a void in career counselling! Thank you, Prof. Chope.	2002-02-03

It may not cover some topics in depth as one would like but it captures the essence and key ideas about the topics. It is indeed a classic.

I would recommend this book as a must read for anyone who wants to refresh his or her career. This is not just a book for 'her'. Ms. Gallagher has done a fantastic job of capturing human attitude and behaviour in the workplace based on observations and interviews and made some very valuable suggestions and recommendation on how one should respond in the world of work. The book covers key issues each of us faces daily in our work-life. The excerpt from the book covers the gist and key points. However, I would recommend reading the book in whole to understand the rationale, justification and thinking behind Ms. Gallagher's suggestion. Nearly every topic has boxed captions which captures the essence of some of these thoughts.<br />Her chapter on fifteen proven strategies that will advance your career and the last chapter on constructing your road map are a very useful guide to those who are self managing their careers.	2001-06-21

This section focuses on persuasion triggers. Of particular value are the persuasion pointers at the end of each chapter. He also tabulated some of the information thereby making it easy to understand the topic without having to plough to through lengthy paragraphs. Paragraphs themselves are sharp, crisp and short.

It is well illustrated with numerous black and white photographs. An ideal book if you want a quick read on India and its history right from its origins. Though I have a 1979 edition published in 1991, the history 'ends' in the seventies. Despite this, Mr Watson has captured a fairly lucid panaromic view of Indian history spanning many centuries. He has documented the key events and milestones in Indian history and therefore the book serves the need of most who want key and basic information without detailed narration and evaluation. The writing style is simple and easy to read. Even young teenagers would be able to read and understand the flow of events especially the arrival and development of different cultures. Recommended reading especially for FBIs (foreign born Indians) who want to know more about their origins or be better able to relate to relatives and friends still on the Indian sub-continent!	2001-03-08

However, its usefulness and value lies in the illustrative examples and Illustration Capsules. The basic principles of strategic management may be simple but its intrepretation and application in different circumstances make strategic management a critical thinking topic. This accounts to a good extent for the length of the book as Thompson &amp; Strickland have included in the book numerous illustrative examples on the application of the concepts of strategic management in practical situations. The 12th edition also introduced two whole new chapters which addresses globalisation and the internet world. Further, nearly all the case studies in the book have been either replaced or up-dated. In fact, the 'up-to-dating' of the book, barely 2 years after the 11th edition hit the market clearly shows the changes in the business world which has merited the issue of the 12th edition. What would have been good would be chapter on Strategies in Managing Change &amp; Transition as any programme in strategic management invariably has to address issue of change in organisations.

The readings address issues such as networking as a culturally differentiated career skill, women &amp; expatriation, feminine leadership, women corporate direcors &amp; lessons from careers of successful women. Part III concerns occupational stress and black and ethnic minority issues (4 readings). Part IV (5 readings) addresses the future - organisational and government initiatives.

Though the book is written based on the American experience, I am of the opinion that it is applicable anywhere in the world. For those who live under the threat of likely loss of their job involuntarily, this book would be useful in understanding the feelings that you may be encountering.This book could even be a road-map to move-on and re-define yourself, discover a new dimension of success and of course, get on with re-building and living a more meaningful life in which you will find satisfaction and happiness in.	2001-02-26

Mr Handy has some very thought provoking ideas about capitalism, work and meaning of life. It was his 'Personal Preface' that attracted me to buy the book. As he said in the conclusion, &quot;Life without hope is dismal.&quot;; I wanted to find out what he meant. In Part A of the book he talks about the impact of capitalism on the capitalist society . He explores the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the marketplace and competition. It is in Part B where the main substance of the book is. It is about the self and how individuals should respond. He profiles the changing world of work over the years and its impact on individuals. In reading the section on self-knowledge and self-awareness, I found the 'obituary exercise' took a new meaning in the context of what I had read; although I had done this exercise several times previously. Learning to live with others and discovering connectivity with society is an important aspect of living. This is very vividly brought out by Mr Handy. It is here I found hope that we could live more meaningful lifes. In Part C, there are some possible solutions to the dilemmas we face. It is in this part, Mr Handy elaborates on the 7 cardinal principles of trust. In the context of career management, the idea of of a school for life and work is a valuable concept. His chapter on the role of government mentions about the I's - information, involvement, individuality and infrastructure. He concludes in the epilogue with seven trends and indicators for the future. I would consider the book as required reading for anyone who wants to add value or meaning to their life, actively contribute to society or is interested in people. Unknown to us, I think all us have a 'Hungry Spirit' within us. Mr Handy's book may meet some of this hunger!	2000-12-24

I read this book in 1994. I recently picked up &quot;Dare To Dream&quot; from my collection whilst researching for a training programme. Surprisingly, I came across some of the 'gems' which I had highlighted. One of them read: &quot;The idea was never merely to make money. The compulsion was to think big, and let it happen. The profits would automatically come in.&quot; Other thoughts of Mr Rai Bahadur, &quot;.....quality costs money but it also brings in more money.&quot;, &quot;...We do it every time.&quot; and there are many more sprinkled throughout the book. Though my edition is nearly 8 years old, the business lessons are as current as yesterday. This book is more than a biography, it is a book in business management about the hotel industry in India. Ms Karkaria could update this book and re-launch the book not only as a biography but resource reading in business management!	2000-12-22

Prof. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has written in common laymen's language about applying simple psychology to lead more meaningful everyday life. His analysis of where time goes, gave me an opportunity to look at how I could use time more meaningfully. In fact, he has devoted two chapters on time management. This book is based on very extensive research and therefore provides much meaningful information. Subjects covered include self-esteem, goal setting, paradox of work, use of leisure, relationship management and managing personal transition. By applying some of the principles and concepts to your life you can use your psychic energy to achieve peak performance and happiness in your life. There are even suggestions to manage the stress and pressures of everyday living. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to improve the life they lead.	2000-12-20

Mr &amp; Mrs Handy have done a wonderful job of narrating about some very ordinary people who have taken up challenges or done extraordinary things. Whilst some names will easily be recognised as success stories, they have also featured very ordinary people, like Joanne McFarlane, Rev Andrew Mawson and Jayesh Manek. The three chapters devoted to the making of alchemists viz. The Nature of Alchemy, The Seed of Alchemy &amp; Growing More Alchemist are interesting reading. I am wondering whether alchemist = entrepreneur? Whilst Mr Handy has a way with words, the book also gives an opportunity to see Mrs Handy's creative photography. Multiple photographs of the subjects are creatively juxtapositioned to give a composite photograph to show the subject in various poses. I have found the book not only enjoyable but inspirational!	2000-12-10

It is not just applicable to non-profit organisations; it applies to all organisations. Chapters on creativity and implementation are useful too as they offer some good suggestions.
