As such, one would expect that everybody would know a lot about it.<br />This book shows that this is not the case. Our western work-ethos has led us to believe that sleeping is for weaklings and that sleeping very little is a sign of discipline and diligence . This book is full of examples of the results of that attitude. As a renowned researcher into the science of sleep, the Author is able to list a considerable number of instances where a lack of sleep did not only lead to less productivity, but led to downright disasters such as the sinking of the \\"Exxon Valdez\\" or the Chernobyl nuclear accident.<br />I found that the book gives a real insight into the importance of obtaining enough sleep. In my case, I found it convincing enough to change some of my habits and go to bed earlier, if need be. As the author shows, a like change throughout society might safe us billions of dollars per year.	2003-03-23

Of those, I'd say some 5 are filled with the information you'd expect.<br />The book actually starts of quite well, analyzing the reasons why people have difficulties mingling and what to do about them. This part of the book really helped me overcome some of my shyness and move out to people. And that certainly made life easier and more fun! However, I wished there would've been more of this and less of the rest.<br />After that the book seems to go all over the place. Chatrooms, Etiquette, public speaking, Yiddish dictionary, general life philosophy... you name it! My advice: try some other books first.	2002-12-08

The latter is possibly even more important as it covers things that could \\"kill\\" you before you even get under way. This category includes things like: becoming a consultant in the first place (if you haven't got the right set of attributes), taking on much personel without them carrying client-aquisition weight, pricing to low or per day etc.<br />The book mainly aims at consultants starting out on their own. However, being a member of a larger consultancy group (Detecon  if you must know), I found that the book contained a number of helpful hints for me when I first started out too. For more experienced consultants, it might help re-focus their minds, although for them I would recommend \\"The ultimate consultant\\" by the same author.<br />This is a great book to get when you're even thinking about entering the field of consulting.	2002-06-26

The Guide to Trouble-Free Pool Maintenance	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Excellent for selecting and maintaining a pool	This is a book for people who know nothing about swimming pools and who are thinking of getting one or who need to maintain an existing pool.<br />The book starts with some basics - the types of pools that exist, water characteristics and treatment - and continues to explain the equipment that comes with a pool. This includes filtration systems, pumps and motors etc. The book closes discussing winterizing and opening up the pool as well as faces-lifts repairs etc. Of course, there is also a chapter on pool-safety.<br />I really liked the book, as it was well-written (easy to read) and seemed to cover all the essentials, getting me knowledgeable enough to handle the pool in my garden. The book is full of illustrations that help to explain the workings of the different parts that come with a pool.<br />As the book at every stage discusses the various types of pools and equipment that exist, the book can also be a real help when trying to decide what kind of pool to get.<br />So, if you are a pool-beginner (pro will need a different level), get this book! The cost are negligeable to those that you can incur from miss-managing your pool.	2002-06-23

(For Dummies (Computers))	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Good introduction for beginners, not easy to digest	Let me start with the good news: This book is packed with information regarding TCP/IP. All of the issues are in here: all the various protocols/support programs related to TCP/IP for both Windows and Unix/Linux. And a lot of it is written in the famous light-hearted dummies-style that keeps the book relatively easy going.<br />What irks me is the organization of the book. Some of it is VERY basic (explaining client/server for example). In contrast, other parts go into fine detail, containing exhaustive lists for example. Overall the book left a somewhat unorganized impression, a bit of a gathering of loosely connected issues in no particular order. For me, this made it diffcult to \\"digest\\" the book and remember the info in it.<br />In summary, if you are looking for a book that will allow a beginner to look up some of the jargon, this book is not a bad choice. For an introductory or advanced textbook, look elsewhere.	2002-06-23

No more.<br />For those who don't know case-studies vey well: a situation is sketched including the history and background of a company as well as its industry. The case usually is accompanied by a number of tables, balance sheets and other items that help the student analyse the situation of the company. After reading the case, the students usually are sent off to construct a course of action for the management to take. The various solutions are then discussed afterwards.<br />The problem with this book is: the second half of the process is lacking. Chapters typically conclude leaving the situation/problem completely open! Fine, if you're going to discuss the issue with fellow-students afterwards. Extremely frustrating if you're sitting in your study, trying to learn something. I have bought the book expecting case-studies including answers and found none.<br />All of this would't be to bad if it was transparent, but in my opinion both the editors notes and most of the reviews here carefully avoid making this aspect of the book too visible.	2002-06-23

The good thing about this book is, that the prices quoted are actual realized sales, i.e. there are no estimates and guestimates in this book.<br />The bad thing is, that whatever you're looking for will almost certainly not be in this book. And if it is, you will not be able to find it, unless you already know the book/the market very well.<br />Why? Well, there is, of course, an infinite amount  of \\"stuff\\" out there. Even Kovel's 900 pages cannot cover it all. That would be less important, if the book a) limited its scope a bit e.g covering only \\"real\\" antiques OR \\"real\\" collectibles and b) showed us how to determine the value of something not in the book(e.g. if \\"your\\" chair is made out of a different kind of wood from the type described in the book, how does that influence the price?).<br />Instead, the problem (of looking up a certain kind of antique) actually is aggravated by the fact that the organization of items is not very clear. Example: if you're looking for the price of a Meissen Porcelaine Figurine, you may have to look under all three categories (Meissen, Porcelaine and Figurines). That of course being subject to you knowing that there is a separate \\"Meissen\\" category and not looking up \\"porcelaine\\" only. Forget the index, it rarely helps.<br />In my opinion, this book can be useful only for people that are willing to put a lot of time into the subject, learning the organization of the book by heart and visiting a lot of auctions / flea markets in order to develop a feeling for the factors influencing prices. A beginning collector is likely to be frustrated by this book.	2002-06-15

So much trouble in fact, that for a while financial chaos on a global scale threatend. What made this development all the more astonishing was the presence of two economics noble laureates amongst the partners of the firm.<br />The author keeps the description of the financial transactions at a level that can be understood by virtually anyone. He paints a colorful picture of the  characters that made up the firm. As the drama unfolds, the whole thing becomes \\"alive\\". The book is great fun to read. In fact, the author does such a good job that the book reads like a novel.<br />Those with a strong background in finance must realise that there are no side bars or the like regarding the transaction details. This is not an economical analysis of the collapse of LTCM.	2002-06-12

It is well-written and contains some of the typical &quot;dummies&quot;-humor helping to keep the text easily digestable.<br />What this book is NOT: A how-to manual that will get your network going if you're sitting in front of a screen clueless on a Sunday morning. That said: after reading this book you won't be clueless any more.<br />On to the detailed contents. The book is divided into six parts:<br />Part I: The absolute basics<BR>No further info necessary: How to open up your computer, so that you can install a networking card, for example.<br />Part II: Building your own network<BR>Planning you network; making basic choices of e.g cabling etc.<br />Part III: Network management for dummies<BR>Basic network management: making backups, taking care of security<br />Part IV: Webifying your network<BR>Creating the connection to the internet; creating websites<br />Part V: More ways to network<BR>Miscelaneous, like: networking your home, dial-in networks and non-standard hard-/software (MacIntosh; Linux etc.)<br />Part VI: The part of tens<BR>A number of top-ten lists, partially amusing, partially useless<br />As I wrote: the book is really good in helping you to obtain an overview of the types of networks that exist and the different terminologies/choices involved. Once you have made a decision that you will need/want to create a network involving operating system X running on computers of type y, you will probably need to get another, more specific book to help you dig deeper.<br />If you haven't made that decision yet: Go get this book!	2002-06-10

The book is very readable, also for people with no scientific/mathematical background whatsoever.<br />In the book, the author reminds us of a number of things in mathematics and statistics that anyone who`s read 101 mathematics/statistics knows, really. But he then goes on to demonstrate how these things work in the marketplace and how many of these basic facts are ignored by the pros. Did you know that a fund manager´s past performance really means NOTHING when predicting his/her future returns. Read the book and find out why!<BR> <BR>As I mentioned, the book is very readable and easy-going on the formal stuff. That does not mean that the author fears 4+-syllable words or that he lacks self-confidence. Indeed, he does not shy away from offering you a life-philosophy in the closing chapters. Personally, I found it refreshing/entertaining, but that`s personal... Anyway, putting up with the latter is a small price to pay in comparison with losing out on the info in this book.	2002-06-06

This is a book written by two sisters who used to live in \\"pig-pens\\" and together developed a way to bring order into their lives. The targeted audience of the book are women with a family who are desperate to get their house-holds under control.<br />Therefore, I´m probably the only male manager who's ever bought and read this book (actually I was looking for a time-management book and hadn´t made a careful selection). Having accidentally bought the book, I decided 200 pages of large print in a small book wouldn´t kill me and I might as well read it.<br />I´m glad I did. My family (and especially my wife) doesn´t really need the book, but we aren´t perfect either and one can never have enough good ideas in this department.<br />The book really assumes the worst about you (if you aren´t, all the better) in terms of self-organization and house-keeping. The system that the \\"slob sisters\\" introduces is interspersed among a lot of real-life experiences and shared thoughts to show that you are NOT alone with this problem, that you ARE a loveable person, that you REALLY CAN change the mess and that an hours worth of work WILL make a difference (which does not mean that you can read the book, put it back on the shelf and assume that you life all of a sudden will become wonderful). Having read the first part, I wished I had read it as a single male student. Then again, in those days I wouldn´t have been caught carrying a book with this kind of front cover out of a bookshop for my life!<br />What really touched me were the latter chapters of the book (including a chapter called \\"can this marriage be saved\\") showing how topics like this can undermine family life, how the women of this world often are abused by the men in their lifes without the latter really knowing about it and how these sort of problems CAN be solved.<br />Once again, I think that we as a family are far removed from the extremities described in this book, but it contains food for thought for males working outside the house.	2002-05-30

Having read a few books on self-improvement, I recognized a lot of important subjects. The author presents these in an easy-going way and really does his best to build the reader up along the way.<br />So why only four stars? The answer lies in the word &quot;touches&quot; in the title of my review. The book doesn't contain all that much text. The author skims past about 50 subjects, each of which deserver a book in their own right.<br />The again, you want to improve your life, (probably) not get a Ph.D. in psychology. So, if you feel that you could do with some wise and credible words from a man who's been there, go ahead and buy this book. If you, after reading, feel that you're still stuck in a rut, then look further, cause there's a lot more in-depth material out there.	2002-05-11

If you read this book, you'll understand why.<br />The book is divided into four parts.<br />The first part deals with the fundamentals that everything else builds upon: paradigms and principles. An important theme running through all of Covey´s work is that of ethical behaviour and delivering one´s contribution to society as a necessary ingredient of succesful living.<br />In part two the author shows you a number of principles that help you to deal with yourself, such as taking responsibility for your own actions and prioritizing your goals.<br />Part three talks about working with other people, addressing such issues as win/win thinking and active listening.<br />The fourth and last part talks about sustaining the things that you have learned and continuing to grow.<br />This book is not a push-over. It has a high level of abstraction. Also, part of this book sounds more like philosophy or even religion, which will not sit well with everyone. However, the author is perfectly correct in first discussing basic values and priorities (\\"doing the right things\\") before discussing techniques for raising efficiency (\\"doing things right\\").<br />Also, it is important that you realise that this is not a self-help book for people who have real specific issues on their hands (self-discipline, traumas, lacking social skill etc.) They will probably need to deal with those specific issues first, before they will be able to take the maximum out of this book.<br />For those who feel that their life is reasonably sorted out, but would like to go (much) further, this is a must-read book.<br />Highly recommended.	2002-05-11

Namely, if you don't act immediatly, you're likely to get a fist on the nose (at least in the more advanced classes)!<br />This book recounts the author's experiences in the SEAL corps, an elite US navy combat group, as well as some of the things he learned in jobs thereafter. It systematically discusses the elements of a mindset that is developed through SEAL-training. It also offers a number of mental tools that will help one cope with many challenges that life throws in our direction. This is somewhat akin to the example about martial arts given above.<br />I'm not sure, in how far these concepts really can be transmitted through a book, but mr. Marcowicz does as good a job of it as can be expected.<br />My advice: go take some beginner's martial arts lessons, then read this book. The combination will prove extremely valuable for coping with almost anything.	2002-05-05

According to the authors, we should move away from focussing exclusively on our and others weaknesses and look more towards developing our natural strengths. <br />This part of the book left me with a somewhat unconvinced feeling - apart from self-evident insights - as it is relatively short, relies heavily on anecdotal evidence and often sounds more like philosophy than like science.<br />Then there is - as the title suggests- the self-help/self-evaluation part. The authors are members of the Gallup organization, which has developed a scientific method and a tool that allow the grouping/evaluation of people according to their talents. Due to the high amount of experience that Gallup has in gathering and evaluating data as well as the discussions in the book this part works very convincing and academically sound. The tool has been implemented on the internet and anyone with an internet connection and a unique copy of the book can evaluate her-/himself. This is the core of the book. It is highly convincing and required reading for anyone in business.<br />The third and final part of the book covers ways in which you / your manager / your organization can implement the insights of the two previous parts. Here we again read a lot of common sense and well-meant advice, but no research to back up the advice.<br />The shift in paradigm for the general public presented here is so large that the authors must have felt obliged to write parts I and III. However, these parts need to ripen further.<br />Buy this book. Then wait for the next revised edition or for books carrying this work on.	2002-04-30

This also defines the audience for this book: the people described above or those who take a keen interest in such people.<br />The book has been written by an adjunct faculty member at Harvard Medical school. The academic level is - as far as I can judge - impeccable. The author quotes on many occasions from actual patient-cases which are common enough that many a reader will recognize some of his or her own headaches. One notices that an effort has been made to write a book that is accessible to the general public. However, the book does maintain a certain academic tone that will be off-putting to some people. There are no exercises, questionaires, or the like that would involve the reader a bit more with the subject matter.<br />Whoever thinks that reading this book and applying a few quick-fix exercises here and mental readjustments there is going to enable them to continue like before, just happier, is extremely mistaken. Dr. Berglas points out that a lot of the misery discussed is a direct result of some deeply engrained characteristics of our culture. For most people, following up on Dr. Berglas' suggestions will imply a drastic (but doable) change in lifestyle.<br />Being somewhat of an academic myself with a keen interest in psychological issues, I found the book extremely valuable. The value to you depends on how you personally feel about the above. However, my advice: if in doubt, buy it!	2002-04-28

In the earlier chapters the facts concentrate on the science of infectuous disease. The latter chapters concentrate more and more on the authorities' sorry state of preparedness.<br />The result is a work that grabs your attention whilst at the same time transferring important information without ever getting tedious. The perfect impression is rounded off in that the authors finish not on a damming note, but by discussing concrete ways forward and warning against excess fear and worry (if not concern).<br />Highly recommended	2002-04-25

Also the selection of topics is exactly that which is needed on a first reading.<br />At the moment where I write this (April 2002), some of the info out of the 2000 edition already seems to be referring to a totally different era. Menem no longer is president and neither is his succesor (or his sucessor for that matter). The times where foreignors were desparate to get into the market and Argentines could dictate terms today seem a distant memory too.<br />Don't let that put you off from buying this book. If you want to obtain a Ph.D. on Argentology, a small volume like this is insufficient. But if you have a (business) interest in Argentina and would like to get to know the essentials fast, this is the book to buy.	2002-04-25

It encompasses the take-over style events at the american stock-exchanges between the 1930s and the 1990s. Evans played an important role in a large number of such events.<br />My only criticism of the book is, that it seems to cover too many topics in one go: a biography of Tom Evans, the development of the proxy fight/hostile take-over theme, the development of corporate management during the 20th century and its effects on society in general. In the passing it provides shallow biographies of a number of company raiders other than Evans. As a result the reader may at times wonder what the leitmotif of the book really is.<br />That having been said, could I have done it better? The answer clearly must be: No! One cannot understand Tom Evans' life without understanding his works and one cannot understand his works without understanding the men he worked with/against as well as the zeitgeist of his era. In the passing the author provides admirable insight into the public discussions and anxieties of the day and offers easy-to-understand but correct descriptions of a number of issues in finance. <br />The author has done much research to dig out a little known era of financial history and analyzed and described it well. As such this book deserves a place in the library of any self-respecting academic interested in the history of finance.<br />If, however, you are looking for a light-hearted novel-style biography, this book is not for you. As a matter of fact, if you're looking for anything thriller-like, move on to the next item on your list. That having been said, there are definitely elements of both in the book. The strong side of this work however are its discussions of the evolution of the take-over phenomenon and its effects in society.<br />On the balance, this is an excellent book for an intelligent audience.	2002-02-25

Although the text seems unassuming at first, an awful lot of trial-and-error must have flown into this book as it almost at every stage seems to know what you're thinking and, based on that, guides you in the right direction.<br />Personally, I am awed by the spot-on analysis of the way that I'm thinking and how that blocked me from doing the things that I want to do. Although striving for &quot;self-discipline&quot; sounds strict and funless, I actually feel liberated after reading this book and even starting to apply the lessons learned. For me the book worked wonders and I am now getting things done that used to lie around for years.	2002-02-14

Concepts are put into practice many chapters before they are introduced. Example: the balance sheet is defined from page 425 (!) onward although, of course, sentences like \\"this shows up on the right-hand side of the balance sheet\\" appear much earlier in the book. The line of reasoning at times is so muddied that I wonder whether the authors understood things themselves. This is underlined by a large number of downright errors.<br />To be fair, there are some positive sides to the book (hence 2 stars): individual chapters contain boxes named \\"you should remember\\" which contain helpful summaries. There are sections intended for practice (including answers) that I would like to see in many other textbooks. Also, some of the sections are actually well-written, interesting and important. It's just that consistency is totally lacking.<br />My conclusion is that, although there are sections in the book that are excellent, a beginner in the subject will not be able to distinguish them from the less succesful material it is interspersed with. Certainly not recommended for the audience it is intended for.	2002-02-02

Although there is a chapter on the &quot;early&quot; days (up to 1900), the meat of the book concentrates on the 20th century.<br />It is absolutely fascinating to read how all of the institutions and rules that investors are confronted with on a daily basis came into existance not that long ago for very good reasons. On the way, the author argues against some well-entrenched historical myths.<br />The book is well-written and as such pleasant to read. It should however be borne in mind that someone who has no background in the stockmarkets whatsoever may not grasp everything being discussed here. However, this adds to a healthy academic standard of the book that is underlined by the many references to further background material.<br />Those who are invested in the stockmarkets will emerge from reading this book enriched by the knowledge that many things that we see today have been with us before and that many statements still heard today have been disproven twenty years ago.	2002-01-16

Although I could have known that this wasn't exactly an encyclopedia from the indicated size (do YOU ever check?), I wasn't prepared for the size of the print or the large amounts of white space on the pages.<br />Being fair, the contents of the booklet are interesting and correct, there's just so little of it. I've seen FAQ-pages of websites that had more content than this booklet (or should I say &quot;brochure&quot;?). On the whole, there seems to be little more here than a high-level mentioning of topics in the field than a true introduction into the topic for would-be doers.	2002-01-10

As such it is well-written, well laid-out and nicely illustrated. It will take every novice through just about everything he/she needs to know and even a little bit further. As such, its ambition to be the &quot;missing manual&quot; seems justified.<br />However, if you, as a great many of us have, have been through various incarnations of Microsoft Windows and are looking for all of the new and exiting aspects of Windows 2000 as opposed to e.g. Windows 98, you're likely to be disappointed. Vast parts of the book would have been exactly the same in a book for one of the older operating systems. The book stops where, in my opinion, things get interesting. Do not expect any clever &quot;insider&quot;-information.	2002-01-04
US	52297986	R1CJLHPUCBXNIC	0130408646	262236711	Wireless Communications & Networks	Books	5	24	25	N	N	A concise introductory textbook	If there is one word by which I would have to describe this book, it would be: &quot;complete&quot;. The author assumes that the reader has nothing but very basic mathematic and scientific training and takes him all the way from first principles in those disciplines to the details of cellular networks, wireless LANs and Bluetooth to mention three of the latter chapters. The ample usage of illustrations, review questions and www-references position this as a high-quality textbook.<br />Then again, if you are an experienced engineer, looking to solve a concrete problem for the wireless system you are presently sitting in front of, you will find that Stallings' book, because of its breadth of treatment, does not reach the necessary depth. In that case: read one of the many references for further study that the author offers.	2001-12-28

The book is full of Bible-Quotes. It uses biblical personalities and settings as examples for burnout and the things that bring burnout about. Of those examples that do not figure biblical personalities, at least half have some strong connection to the church.<br />Personally, I feel that a book that deals with a clinical psychological issue, such as burnout, should rely on academic research and reasoning. That is missing here. Time and again the bible is taken as the source of all truth and the author's interpretation as our guiding line for doing things in life. Especially the latter makes it very difficult reading for people with academic training who are used to take a critical view of unsubstantiated statements.	2001-12-25
US	52297986	RFX7TWQ0KV3QW	006019605X	479296655	Attitude Is Everything: 10 Life-Changing Steps to Turning Attitude into Action	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Basic motivational thoughts - possibly life-changing	This book is one in a long series of books showing people how much the way they handle life, rather than what life throws at them, determines their success and - dare I say it - happiness.<br />This is one of life's tough lessons and most of us - myself included - continuously need to be reminded of it in order to muster the necessary self-discipline to keep in line with positive thinking.<br />As such, the book is well-written. It relies heavily on the author's own experiences, which lends credibility, but here and there is somewhat overdone. Personally, I somewhat sensed a lack of sophistication. This is probably partially due to all of the easy-to-remember lists of &quot;3 P's&quot;, five qualities, 10 tools etc. There seemed to be very little padding between such lists. The scene where a pickles-salesman offers pickles to everybody on the plane and furthes demonstrates his tremendous attitude by stating &quot;I love pickles&quot; to me appeared Pythonesque.<br />Then again- if one of these lists really changes the way you get a grip on your life, this will be the most important you'll ever buy.	2001-12-04

It is easy to read and also is convincing as it, time and again, refers back to field research done by the author. To underline this, many observations of actual sales-calls are &quot;quoted&quot;.<br />If you are new to sales, you might find that the continuous assumption that &quot;you have been, of course, for a long time been familiar with the following concepts...&quot; gets a bit irritating after a while. A side-effect is, that the author quite often feels the need to defend himself against established sales-culture. Also, the fact that the book brings useful news for those selling &quot;large&quot; items only does not exactly jump from the publisher's notes.<br />However, if you are in large sales and wondering why the old-establised methods aren't working for you, then this book could be worth its weight in gold for you and then some.	2001-08-19
