Although the information is valuable, the scope is awfully broad, and Abbot Ricciotti has difficulty keeping the chronology of his narrative in order, making it a little hard to follow in spots.  His writing style is scholarly and almost bland, but that may be due to the translation.  In any event, he is very careful when citing his authorities to make sure we understand how reliable or unreliable they might be.  This is a big plus, because this time period is rife with legends, misrepresentations, and wildly divergent points of view. On the whole, I came away with a much fuller understanding of the tensions between pagan and Christian Rome and of the sordid details of the persecutions and political scheming for power that unfortunately dominated the entire period.	2005-09-29

Cobbett's instruction on our language is indeed impressive and contains information useful even today.  However, the real fun starts with his made-up examples of bad grammar, which frequently include a completely gratuitious broadside aimed at one political antagonist or another.  He also quotes extensively from these political antagonists to demonstrate how their book learning and social position in no way prevent them from committing astounding blunders of grammer and cogitation.	2005-09-08

Cornwell is interested in discerning to what extent and how various titans of science responded Nazi ideology.  He concludes with the assertion that scientists cannot remain morally neutral or aloof; inevitably, their ideas and actions as scientists are inevitably colored by practical and ethical judgments at every step.  A very few, such as Lise Meitner and Max von Laue, are portrayed as heros, risking life and limb to resist Nazi oppression.  A great many come off as Nazi hacks, driven by petty jealousies, ambition, political maneuvering for funding, and/or misplaced nationalistic fervor.  Some, Werner Heisenberg in particular, appear enigmatically torn, shifting between loyalty to their regime and resistence to its monstrous agenda.  In fact, Cornwell spends a good amount of time on Heisenberg and Nazi efforts to develop an atomic bomb, an effort that was plagued by inefficiency and blunders which contrasted so sharply with the Manhattan Project. Cornwell also delves deep into rocketry, code breaking, and a variety of developments in chemistry and weaponry.  Surprising in a book about scientific ethics, he spends relatively little time on medicine and the concentration camps--not that there's any lack of information on that horrific subject.  While Cornwell's opinions on ethics are reasonable, insightful, and well supported by facts, I found equally interesting his elegant character sketches of the various personalities, and his rather dramatic narratives about the rise and fall of certain technologies and the outcomes of the life and death scientific competition between each side of World War II. Who decides whether science will make the world better or worse?  What is the proper relationship between the scientist and the state?  What is the scientist's responsibility to morality that transcends the state?  As Cornwell points out in his concluding chapters, these were huge questions during WWII, but no less so--perhaps more so--today.  Science has a greater capacity than ever to do good or evil.  The author does not presume to know all the answers, but he sure knows how to ask the right questions.the state?

Cobbett's whole life, GK says, \\"was a resistance to the degradation of the poor...\\"  Cobbett's books and pamphlets attacking social injustice were scathing and personal.  They also contained a great deal of truth.  Because of his style and mercurial personality, many in his day dismissed him as a crank.  However, by Chesterton's day, Cobbett's insight had become rather obvious: aristocrats driven by greed had indeed shattered the Christian stability of English society; and then more recently capitalism had finished the job of making a complete wreck of the English lower classes.  Chesterton skillfully shows how the experiences of Cobbett's life, with his yeoman roots, influenced his almost unique (at the time) vision of England.  Cobbett, GK says, was a rare individual who could see before he was able to read; in other words, he saw for himself the clues to England's past--the majestic gothic arches, the churches too large for the villages--and found later that what he had seen did not square with the accepted historical explanations.<br /><br />GK gives us a great sense of Cobbett both as a fascinating personality and an historically crucial figure.

Mr. Bork's basic premise is that two forces, present in our culture for at least a century but jump-started during the Sixties, are the root of all evil: radical individualism and radical egalitarianism.  Since the former urges toward complete license and the latter toward complete control, the two forces are logically incompatible yet coexist destructively in their respective spheres:  \\"The Sixties generation combined moral relativism with political absolutism.\\"  Thus we see, for example, liberals pushing unlimited access to pornography on the personal level, and pushing racial quotas on the policy level.  Moral relativists assert implicitly or explicity that all ideas and behaviors have equal value, yet at the same time, when moral relativists are in a position to exert authority--as judges, university presidents, editors--all ideas and behaviors supportive of Christianity and Western culture are thrown out the window.  Mr. Bork brilliantly and brutally exposes these farcical inconsistencies as they apply to the key issues of our day, including judicial activism, freedom of speech, abortion, euthanasia, and welfare.  By far his favorite (and most entertaining) target is feminism, which he portrays as a thoroughly disingenuous, shrill, preposterous and malignant intellectual disease that has infected far more aspects of our society than seems possible.<br /><br />This highly perceptive and well argued survey of American culture is, unfortunately, overshadowed by Judge Bork's relentless pessimism.  If you agree that liberal elites in the media, entertainment, politics, and education are laying waste to our culture, then you will be mortified by his ticking off of example after example of liberal success--a process Mr. Bork sees as a juggernaut that will continue to roll over whatever feeble challenge conservatism might offer up.  True, he ends with an attempt at optimism, something about the potential of human will to overcome hopeless intellectual odds, but it is only a few pages of roughly sketched out ideas.  I wish that he would have concentrated more of his considerable intellect on articulating responses to the liberal challenge instead of merely making my blood boil.nly a few pages of roughly sketched out ideas.

In general, the Cure's relentless theme is sin: how we must change our ways or risk eternal damnation. We must not be content to be better than the worst; instead we must strive to recognize all sin in ourselves and be rid of it.  The Cure provides no wiggle room for us.  Time and time again he points out how we mistakenly rationalize what seem to be small transgressions--the occasional profanity, our almost unnoticed attitudes of envy and pride, our habitual preference of worldly over eternal things.  And the Cure's vivid descriptions of how this all plays out ring true.  He must have been no stranger to temptation, because he writes with an insight and power that can only come with experience. If the modern reader thinks the Cure's words are harsh and his views impossibly rigid, it is worth remembering that these sermons were addressed to a profligate flock, one that was fully immersed in the fashionably immoral French society of his time.  We might consider that in the moral atmosphere of ninteenth-century France, not so different from today's, people ultimately responded to the Saint with a dramatic renewal of faith that still brings multitudes of pilgrims to Ars. Will today's more common responses to sin--accomodating it, rationalizing it, ignoring it--produce the same fruit?	2005-08-01

While visiting Dublin to attend the Eucharistic Congress of 1932, GK waxes eloquent on conversion, the Eucharist as the essence of faith, and the singular truth of Christ he finds amid the incredible shapes and sizes of the Faith and the faithful. A couple quotes:<br /><br />\\"There are those who tell us we must broaden our ideas, by which they mean disembody or discolour them, in order to make a universal religion for men...The truth is flatly the other way.\\"<br /><br />\\"And I sometimes wondered whether even political democracy would not be a little more practical if people prepared for the General Election as they did for the Eucharistic Congress, with prayer and penance rather than with publicity and lies.\\"<br /><br />\\"The New Jerusalem\\" is a poetic description of the city seen in the light of its awesome history, as well as a penetrating  commentary on Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and modern Europe.<br /><br />\\"It is really not so repulsive to see the poor asking for money as to see the rich asking for more money.  And advertisement is the rich asking for more money.\\"<br /><br />\\"As for our own society, if it proceeds at its present rate of progress and improvement, no trace or memory of it will be left at all.  Some think this would be an improvement in itself.\\"  How prophetic!<br /><br />\\"A Short History of England\\", which contains no actual dates (!), shows GK at his absolute best when it comes to distilling general principles from a dizzying array of facts.  His command of the facts is superb, and his interpretation, which stood in stark contrast to the conventional wisdom of the time, rings truer than ever and ought to be heard.<br /><br />\\"The ninteenth-century historians went on the curious principle of dismissing all people of whom tales are told, and concentrating upon people of whome nothing is told.\\"<br /><br />Speaking of the existence of an external God and against the idea of faith as a purely interior phenomenon, he says, \\"I do not, in my private capacity, believe that a baby gets his best physical food by sucking his thumb; nor that a man gets his best moral food by sucking his soul, and denying its dependence on God or other good things.

On page 207, Trifkovic neatly sums up the book:  \\"Islam is revolutionary in outlook, extremist in behavior, totalitarian in ambition.\\"  For proof, he cites historical evidence from Muhammud to present day--a history characterized mainly by bloody oppression and stifling intolerance.  Islam, according to Trifkovic, is the other end of the spectrum from the secular ideology that currently runs the show in the West: whereas secularism permits everything, Islam permits nothing (he hastens to point out, however, that both ideologies run away from the natural law, and that is the source of the trouble).  To me, the most interesting points of the book were--<br /><br />1. That Islam is more than a religion, it is an ideology encompassing faith, politics, all aspects of society and culture.  Whereas Jesus said \\"render unto Caesar\\", no such distinction exists in Islam.  Trifkovic frequently compares Islam to communism and fascism, only a more potent version.  Like these other ideologies, Islam cannot \\"peacefully coexist\\" with other belief systems or political structures within a society.  The end game is total control.<br /><br />2.  That Islamic governements incited ethnic cleansings of massive proportions in the 20th century, actions that have been surpressed in the West for a variety of economic, political, and ideological reasons.  Trifkovic's accounts of the horrors of Smyrna, where the entire Greek Orthodox population was wiped out, and similar, larger scale assaults in Armenia, India, the Balkans, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Sudan, are truly horrific even compared to 9-11.<br /><br />3.  That, appallingly, Western policy since 1900 has been one of consistent appeasement.  Greed entices us to value oil profits over our own safety.  Moral relativism blinds us to the possiblity that we could be facing an enemy willing to die for its absolute beliefs.  Cultural self-hatred leads us to embrace or at least tolerate any value system that isn't Judeo-Christian.  Trifkovic believes that unless we face reality, and face it fast, Western culture, and those of us who inhabit it, are done for.<br /><br />Pretty disturbing stuff--how much is accurate and how much a distortion or exaggeration I don't know.  However, it's safe to assume that whatever we get in our mainstream media is probably off the mark, and pronouncments from special interest groups on all sides are self-serving.

Kelly, well familiar with the key leaders in the American Church, chronicles developments here since Vatican II in great detail.  He observes that since the Council, people in key leadership positions too often hold views that are a distortion, if not an outright falsification of, the true aims of the Council.  Essentially, these views boil down to a denial to one extent or another of papal authority and Church Tradition, and the acceptance of relativism in faith and morals.  This change of view, so precisely opposite the strong orthodoxy that characterized the American Church before Vatican II, can be seen in Catholic colleges, seminaries, religious orders (especially the Jesuits), and (amazingly) among many bishops.  The results have been dire: a weakening of faith and optimism among the laity, fewer conversions and more \\"cafeteria Catholics\\", and great confusion as to the true direction and purpose of the Church.  Msgr. Kelly believes this battle between defenders of the Faith and those seeking a new faith has gone on far too long.  He looks to the Bishops and to Rome for leadership:  if they take a strong stand, rejecting half-measures, appeasement and laxity, they can do much to reclaim and reenergize the hearts and minds of the flock.  And, as Msgr. Kelly frequently reminds us, it is not merely a question of hearts and minds, but of souls.  Those who are taken in by the secular norms of our day, who attempt to reduce this battle to a political disagreement between \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" or between \\"freedom\\" and \\"obedience\\" make a grave error.  This is not a political dispute with merely material ramifications, it is a spiritual war upon which our eternal salvation rides.  This point of Msgr. Kelly seems much in need of making, since it seems that so many, even Church leaders themselves, seem so eager to miss it.	2005-05-30

His basic premise is that natural law is what it is--an inescapable fact of life whether we accept it or not, whether we like it or not.  To the extent we deny or defy the natural law, we consciously or unconsciously fall prey to all manner of psychological and spiritual corruption--denial, rationalization, overcompensation, etc.  He describes many \\"real world\\" examples of how this plays out, often describing various responses to the issues of abortion and homosexuality.  As I read, I found myself continually thinking, \\"Yes--that is how I responded to that,\\" or \\"That really is what people do.\\"  His arguments, supported by powerful appeals to common sense and written in plain everyday English, are very persuasive.

Reader beware: Kreeft uses some awfully strong language--he's not afraid to smash his fist into a locker or throw a clipboard at your head to get your attention.  But any Christian, Jew, Muslim, or really any believer in God can play on Kreeft's team.  And whether you come in tired, confused, mad, or even just warming the bench, you'll want to get out there and take on the forces of evil after hearing his inspiring, if not frightening, message.<br /><br />Kreeft lays out the enemy's battle plan ala C.S. Lewis/The Screwtape Letters, speaking as Satan addressing his team of demons.  While the concept of a literal Satan may be quaint to some, Kreeft builds a pretty convincing case for his existence, through Biblical citations but more through some persuasive logical argument.  Kreeft maintains that once we understand the enemy, his goal and his plan, we can formulate a response.  The enemy, of course, is Satan; the goal is the total corruption of souls; the plan is to wreak personal and social chaos by infusing the philosphy of relativism into all our thoughts and actions.  But despite the damage that's been done, Kreeft is anything but pessimistic: he is certain that it is never too late to wake up to the dangers and take effective action.  Kreeft explains how we can do this.  Well worth reading, as long as you're willing to set your complacency aside!	2005-05-17

Compilations of Papal documents are hard to come by, so on that basis alone this is a valuable and useful book.  This particular compilation is an extraordinarily powerful and persuasive defense of orthodox belief against modernism: powerful because of the unrelenting clarity and consistency of thought, and persuasive, among other reasons, because so many of the Popes' direst predictions have sadly come to pass.  Although every document herein is worthy of study, these happened to be my favorites:<br /><br />\\"For, once ascribe to human reason the only authority to decide what is true and what is good, and the real distinction between good and evil is destroyed...\\"  Pope Leo XIII's encyclical \\"On the Nature of True Liberty\\" brilliantly explains and defends the concept of natural law, and how popular notions of liberty and tolerance are perverted when natural law is ignored, and how this perversion gravely harms man and society.  Though written in 1888, this document perfectly describes what ails the government-citizen relationship in the USA and exactly how we can fix it.<br /><br />\\"It is owing to their pride that they [modernists] seek to be reformers of others while they forget to reform themselves...\\"  Pope St. Pius X's deeply philosophical encyclical \\"On Modernism\\" probes the essence of modern thought, revealing all of its hypocrisy, inconsistency, and spiritual dangers.<br /><br />\\"The social question will be much nearer a solution when all those concerned, less demanding as regards their respective rights, shall fulfill their duties more exactingly.\\"  Although Pope St. Pius X's 1910 encyclical \\"Our Apostiolic Mandate\\" directly concerns the Church's proper response to a now obscure French Catholic social movement, it makes important points about how responsibility must accompany liberty--points sorely in need of making in the USA today.<br /><br />I think Catholics who read these documents will gain a much better understanding of the Faith and valuable insight into the \\"culture of death\\" that seeks to destroy it.  For non-Catholics, the book could also be most helpful in understanding the role of the Pope in the Church and society--a role that is often misunderstood or viewed in the worst possible light.  With Pope John Paul II's passing, we were all reminded of his crucial role in bringing down communism.  This kind of historic and positive Papal influence is nothing new:  Pope Leo XIII's \\"On the Condition of the Working Class\\", a monumental encylical from 1891, was enormously influential in bringing justice to the working classes in the West, and sturdying our defenses against the coming onslaught of communism, a challenge Pope Leo saw a good many years before most did.

The author presents a sweeping history of materialist moral philosophy from ancient Greece to current day.  For Wiker, Western morality is split crisply and catastrophically into two utterly irreconcilable camps: the Epicurean, in which man is the measure of all things, and the Judeo-Christian, in which God is the measure of all things.  Epicurus believed the goal of man is to reduce his personal pain and discomfort.  Starting with this conclusion, he backed into a cosmology to support it, one which excludes the possibilities of (a) an afterlife and (b) divine interference with human affairs, both of which constrain our actions and leave us in a continual state of apprehension.  It follows in the Epicurean view that nature is random and therefore without purpose.  If nature is random, then there are no values or behaviors we humans are required to embrace.  This conception of morality and its supporting cosmology, dormant from roughly Constantine to the Renaissance, revived when scientific discovery seemed to support Epicurean cosmic theories.  It gained momentum as science advanced and eventually overwhelmed Judeo-Christian cosmology and morality, at least in terms of our social practices and laws.  Wiker does an absolutely magnificent job of critiquing a host of enormously influential materialist figures including Newton, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, and Darwin himself, elegantly and convincingly tracing their ideas back to their Epicurean sources, and revealing the true essence and implications of their ideas.  Unfortunately, in a world where one person's idea of right and wrong is as good as another's, where the only true definition of right and wrong is how it makes us feel, abuses, miseries, and horrors are bound to ensue.  As Wiker reviews the thought of such modern day monsters as Ernst Haeckel, Margaret Sanger, and Alfred Kinsey, we begin to get an idea of how awful the materialist's reality can be.  And yet, Wiker points out that although scientific advances in our day undermine the random view of nature and strongly support a designer universe, the materialist habit of thought is so deeply ingrained that we cling to relativistic moral positions required by random nature anyway.  There are so many fascinating ideas in this book it is almost impossible to summarize.  But, I think it can help anyone put his/her ideas in perspective and offer some refreshingly sensible insight about our culture, which seems so irreconcilably split over issues like abortion, euthanasia, recreational drugs, etc., etc.an idea of how awful the materialist's reality can be.

Some, like Freud, are famous; others, like Francis Galton, whose pernicious ideas about eugenics exert tremendous influence to this day, were unfamiliar to me.  These sketches include a basic overview of their thought along with purely biographical information.  In several cases, it becomes obvious that their personal torments  formed or helped form their aberrant philosophies. This attempt to establish a causal connection between personality and philosophy is a major point the authors strive to make, thinking that in so doing they discredit the ideas themselves--an approach that may not be entirely valid philosophically but is highly interesting nonetheless.  Since the sketches are roughly 20 pages long, we are only getting a superficial overview.  However, the writing is crisp and provocative, definitely whetting the appetite for more. As the authors point out in their introduction, many of us blame our current problems of abortion, euthenasia, moral decay, etc. on \\"the Sixities\\" or Roe vs. Wade, not realizing that these phenomena themselves are rooted in ideas that go back two hundred years or more.  To really understand how deep-rooted this culture of death is, we need to understand how we got here.  This book provides excellent introduction to the whole line of thought that has wreaked such havoc on our culture.	2005-04-11

It turned conventional wisdom on its head and influenced many high-powered pro-Catholic intellectuals, including Hilaire Belloc and GK Chesterton.  Cobbett's basic premise is that the Reformation destroyed the social fabric of England, which had been sewn together so elegantly under nine centuries of Catholic influence and rule.  His detailed account of Henry VIII's profligacy, the rapacious deeds of his political heirs and allies, and the havoc they wrought upon the citizenry, especially the poor citizenry, make a supremely convincing argument.  Although Cobbett wields a venomous pen, he researched his subject well and appears to have most of his facts straight.  And although he interprets the facts in the worst possible light, there is no getting around the one simple fact that greed, lust and hatred motivated many of England's \\"reformers\\".  Cobbett's style is conversational--as if he were writing you a letter, almost--and is remarkably readable for a work of that period.  I think any investigation of the Reformation should include this book!	2005-03-29

On some issues, such as organized labor, Catholics and Progressives reached similar conclusions.  On others, such as education, they could not have been further apart. On all issues, a great fundamental difference applied:  does man exist to serve man, or to serve God?  So, although both sides might settle on similar remedies for social problems, their underlying principles were so different that conflict was inevitable.  Progressives viewed dogma of any kind as a social nuisance or something to be dispensed with entirely.  Catholics naturally held dogma to be fundamental to a well-ordered society.  Progressives (generally) viewed man as a servant of the state; Catholics viewed society as the servant of man.  Progressives were primarily concerned with the advancement of the state; Catholics with the salvation of the soul.  Woods does a thoroughly excellent job of articulating these and other philosophical differences.  In doing so, he gives us a remarkably clear picture of that time in America, as well as allowing us to judge how things have progressed--or regressed--on issues like education over this last century.	2005-03-23

Lewis turns conventional thinking on its head.<br /><br />\\"Why I Am Not a Pacifist\\" is a logical critique that demolishes the pacifist position.<br /><br />\\"Transposition\\" is a deep theological reflection on how we are to understand and interpret miracles, and how we are naturally inclined to do it incorrectly.<br /><br />\\"Is Theology Poetry?\\" discusses the relationship between the two, with Lewis making a surprising case for Christian theology being, at one level, very poor poetry.  At the core of his argument is the fact that we are not drawn to religion by virtue of its poetic appeal--there are other, deeper reasons for faith.<br /><br />\\"The Inner Ring\\" counsels university students to do what is right, not what is popular.<br /><br />\\"Membership\\" explains the meaning of the term in the Christian sense of one body with many parts, as opposed to the more modern idea of membership as all people being equal.  While Lewis commends the notion of equality in its proper place, he says that \\"[Christianity] is the hierachical world, still alive and (very properly) hidden behind a facade of equal citizenship...\\"  A tremendous meditation on the complex interplay between religion and social institutions, on how we can remain truly human in a society that of necessity tends to suppress our humanity.<br /><br />\\"On Forgiveness\\" highlights the easily glossed over distinction between forgiving sins and excusing them.  With a personal frankness typical of all these essays, Lewis makes his point about how we tend to make excuses rather than accept responsibility by revealing his own shortcomings.<br /><br />\\"A Slip of the Tongue\\" is about how we tend to compartmentalize our faith, how we try to keep our beliefs from intruding on the \\"real world\\" where we live except when we're in church.<br /><br />Lewis tackles some very difficult problems, but if he does not completely solve them, he certainly puts them in a perspective we may not have considered.l of all these essays, Lewis makes his point about how we tend to make excuses rather than accept responsibility by revealing his own shortcomings. <br /> <br />\\"A Slip of the Tongue\\" is about how we tend to compartmentalize our faith, how we try to keep our beliefs from intruding on the \\"real world\\" where we live except when we're in church. <br /> <br />Lewis tackles some very difficult problems, but if he does not completely solve them, he certainly puts them in a perspective we may not have considered.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-17

Unlike many of his books, which speak mainly to the religious contemplative, \\"Life and Holiness\\" is written for the lay person.  How can we we lead truly Christian lives in the hustle and bustle of daily life?  What does it really mean to have faith, hope and charity in our hearts?  In terms of vocation, how do we know what God wants us to do?  Are we aspiring to holiness, or are we just trying to get by in our faith?  What are the consequences of just trying to get by?  In a world so full of seemingly insoluble social problems, what can we do to really change anything?  How can we have deep authentic faith without turning our backs on the world?  These are just some of the difficult question Merton tries to answer with his usual insight and common sense.  I think this book provides excellent help for anyone seeking to put his/her life in a better, more faith-filled perspective.	2005-03-08

As we move spiritually into the more interior mansions, we come closer and closer to God. The book describes our progress toward true self-awareness, which is really the awareness that God is within us. As we draw closer to God we begin to understand the things that pull us away from Him (sin), and become better able to put our thoughts and actions in the right perspective, that is thinking and acting according to God's will and not our own.  St. Teresa makes an extraordinary effort to describe the indescribable--what it feels like and looks like to commune with the Lord--using vivid examples from her own experiences of where she went right...and where she went wrong.  Her words are full of sound practical advice, and yet at times her ideas are so beyond my experience I wasn't able to grasp them. Subtle and profound, \\"Interior Castle\\" requires great patience to read, but is well worth the time.	2005-02-26

The young Belloc describes his walking trip from southeastern France to Rome, which (most intriguingly) he tries to accomplish by walking in a straight line, 30-45 miles a day.  This extraordinary route takes him well off the beaten track, through isolated villages, nearly unpassable mountains and rivers, and sparsely populated plains.  Belloc describes his experiences with his usual insight and offers humurous digressions on aspects of faith and culture as well. The book also contains a good number of rough landscape sketches he drew during his journey. In the end, Belloc paints a thoroughly detailed and honest picture of the Europe he loved so well and was to write of with such power. In the process he also gives us a detailed picture of his own character and mood, something quite helpful in interpreting his historical works.	2005-01-25

He divides them into three types--<br /><br />\\"Survivals\\" are either discredited, like fundamentalism, or ever present but currently (1929) in disrepute, like materialism.<br /><br />\\"Main Opposition\\" are the strongest of the hour--for Belloc nationalism, anti-clericalism, and most significantly, the \\"modern mind\\", a vague, passive resistance to faith and dogma built on ill-conceived, ill-considered ideas about the infallibility of science, the inevitability of progress, and the primacy of man.  Of immense interest is Belloc's critique of compulsory state sponsored education--a fairly new thing in Britain at the time.  He sees quite clearly that such an assembly line process leads to the weakening of parental authority, a deadening of intellectual acuity, and the development of a world view that prioritizes certain types of knowledge above a clear, rational sense of morality.  All these effects, as Belloc prophetically observes, lead to social decay.<br /><br />\\"New Arrivals\\" are developing enemies.  With remarkable foresight, Belloc zeroes in on what he calls \\"Neo-Paganism\\", which is an attitude of despair, a flat rejection of absolute truth in faith and morals.  Belloc accurately predicts the growth of this attitude in the West and the terrible damage it will unleash on our society and culture.<br /><br />Belloc is enlightening as usual.  He not only explains the nature of these movements, but sketches their historical roots, so that we get some sense of how these things developed, and why.  It is easy to see that many of these oppostions exist today, although in somewhat different forms, described in different terms, and somehow jumbled up together in a vague secular attitude. The clear and thorough examination in this book helps us make sense of this jumble, and perhaps to formulate a response.	2005-01-09

By examining the mind of man as creator and the work he creates, we can acquire a better understanding of the Holy Trinity.  While this might seem outlandish at first, it works! When you think about theological concepts just as concepts, they can be very hard to grasp.  But Sayers uses concrete examples to illustrate theological concepts, and avoids the temptation to overextend her analogy.  She concentrates mainly on the writer-creator, since she herself is a writer.  Her insights on the creative process of writing are almost as interesting as the light they shed on the nature of God.  These insights go well beyond the concept of the Trinity--she offers an interesting perspective on the existence of evil, free will, and much more. I've never read anything like this.	2004-12-29

Fr. Copleston's book was immensely helpful.  His writing style is clear and elegant.  He avoids technical philosophical jargon whenever possible and illustrates difficult concepts with everyday, real life examples.  He also does a  thorough job of comparing and contrasting Aquinas and his major influence, Aristotle.  On occasion Copleston remarks on how Aquinas differs from Kant and other more contemporary thinkers; I wish there had been a little more of that as well, but I imagine his multi-volume History of Philosophy covers all that in detail.  I think this book is a fantastic place to start for anyone interested in Aquinas and Middle Ages philosophy in general.	2004-12-14

Belloc describes four major transitional periods:<br /><br />1.  From pagan to Christian Rome during the Empire.<br /><br />2.  From Empire to Dark Ages.<br /><br />3.  From Dark Ages to Middle Ages.<br /><br />4.  From Middle Ages to Reformation.<br /><br />Among the important themes Belloc highlights:<br /><br />1.  Roman tradition and influence runs deeply and continuously through European history.  By so demonstrating, he debunks the myth of the \\"master race\\"--a popular theme among his intellectual contemporaries. Pity so few listened to him.<br /><br />2.  It was the Catholic Church that held Europe together through the centuries, the glue of our civilization.  In his own words, \\"Europe is the church, and the Church is Europe.\\"<br /><br />I found his analysis of Empire to Dark Ages particularly helpful.  Belloc makes good sense out of the period's confusingly intertwined barbarian and Roman influences and its complex political and military dynamics.  Bottom line: the Roman Empire was never conquered from without; in reality, it changed gradually but profoundly from within, all the while retaining its vital social and spiritual roots.<br /><br />Belloc's review of the Reformation, especially Britain's leading role in destroying the Unity of Faith, makes for sad, surprising and sobering reading even today. (For a much fuller and yet more moving treatment, read Belloc's \\"How the Reformation Happened.\\")<br /><br />For Belloc, the European ideal came during the Middle Ages, when people were unified in faith and hungered for truth more than riches. By his day, Europe had reached new lows of disunity, sophistry, and capitalist greed.  Belloc was one of the few prominent thinkers to see these evils early on and predict their awful consequences.  Although his subject was history, I think Belloc was writing with an eye to the future, in the hope that we might understand the errors of our past and correct them before too late.	2004-11-27

All other spiritual postions are compromise.  This amusing novella illustrates the point.  The main characters, an ardent Catholic and a committed atheist, wish to engage in a duel to the death in defense of their beliefs. They are continually interrupted by a stream of characters representing all sorts of moral types.  Although the subject is interesting, the narrative doesn't flow well: first you have pages of philosophical dialog, and then intervals of action and plot development of varying length.  The result is great difficulty in keeping everything straight.  Although the book contains the usual GK wit and wisdom, it is not as tightly composed as his better works.<br /><br />A word about this (Dover) edition: hard to read.

The first portion, on the importance of dogma in an authentically religious life, is passionate, persuasive, and predicts the coming battle between Christianity and paganism in Western culture.  Interesting as this is, I found the second part of the book more intriguing still, when Sayers turns her attention to the significance of work and then to the Seven Deadly Sins.  She draws a crucial distinction between work as an end in itself and work as a means to an end.  Instead of treating our work as our gift to God, are we merely looking for a paycheck so we can get more stuff?  Sayers exposes the social ills wrought by excessive materialism and insufficient attention to our moral responsibilities, and carries this theme further in her discussion of the deadly sins.  This final chapter makes for an excellent examination of conscience as well as an embarrassing commentary on the crass materialism that pervades our culture, almost invisible in the absence of moral reflection.  And above all, this book exhorts us to moral reflection.  With remarkable power and insight, Sayers encourages us to ask, \\"What am I doing, and why am I doing it?\\"	2004-11-07

In the end, Rose does tie it together with a theory that seems eminently sensible: that our American priest shortage is a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Liberal bishops seek an end to the celibate priesthood.  Seminaries under their control are thus staffed with like-minded administrators, teachers and formation faculty who promote agendas of sexual liberation, feminism, sacramental irrelevance, etc.  Orthodox candidates leave.  This creates a severe shortage of priests, providing a convenient excuse to promote ordination of women and lay ministries--in short a \\"new\\" (i.e., Protestant) Catholic Church. Conversely, in conservative American dioceses, where young men of orthodox spirit are welcomed instead of repelled, vocations are on the rise, and priest shortages are less severe or non-existent. Rose contends the root of the problem goes back to the self-indulgent philosophy of the '60's.  Self-fulfillment becomes more important than self-sacrifice.  Experimentation displaces tradition.  Pleasure trumps propriety, and moral relativism replaces moral objectivism and its corollary, rational thought.  While these new values crept relatively slowly into American culture at large, they quickly gained power in our seminaries.  The cumulative result is a priesthood without a clear identity, either of itself or to lay Catholics and the secular world. While many attribute the horrible sexual scandals of the priesthood to the practice of celibacy, Rose believes the explanation is just the opposite.  Such scandal has arisen out of an immoral atmosphere of feel-good ethics and outright disdain for Catholic teaching.  Rose believes the problem can be fixed, but first it must be understood.isdain for Catholic teaching.  Rose believes the problem can be fixed, but first it must be understood.	2004-11-02

Belloc sees the development of the press as a child of capitalism: by 1918 the establishment press in England is driven by profit instead of truth, and has incredible power to shape policy and control policy makers. Why?  Newspapers sell for less than it costs to produce them.  The difference is made up by advertising.  Thus newspaper owners are beholden to advertisers and are not inclined to run stories counter to their interest. Newspapers can make or break politicians at will.  They tend to suppress discussion of real political issues in favor of manufactured ones so they can spin news according to their own interests.<br /><br />Sound familiar?  Many people will find truth in these descriptions even today, with regard to the major news networks.  Belloc sees a remedy: an independent free press.  Belloc argues that by reading many different perspectives, extreme though they may be, one can distill the real truth of the matter.  He observes this is exactly how we develop opinions outside of the mass media--by listening to a variety of people describe the event and assess their credibility, as in a criminal trial for instance.  A free press did exist in 1918, but was in its infancy.  Thanks to the Internet, we finally have the truly free press that Belloc predicted would flourish.<br /><br />This tract might make you rethink the idea of digesting a steady diet of network news only.  What you get is not necessarily what you see.	2004-10-25

This book neatly traces their spiritual journeys, and how they profoundly influenced each other along the way.  Pearce devotes attention to such giants as Hilaire Belloc (a rare literary cradle Catholic), Chesterton, Ronald Knox, T. S. Eliot, Evelyn Waugh, Edith Sitwell, C. S. Lewis and Alec Guinness, and also covers many of the lesser known and under appreciated poets, writers, and actors of the time.  For some, the decision to convert took a few years, for others nearly a lifetime.  Some came from positions of hardened atheism or agnosticism, others were disaffected or perfunctory Protestants. Some came to the Church as a result of suffering or loss, others from a cool and intellectual study of theology and history.  Pearce quotes heavily in his book-perhaps too heavily-but there are several quotations from these brilliant people that made me think \\"Aha!\\" or \\"That's what I've been trying to say!\\"  In particular, I was amazed to see the far-reaching influence of Belloc and Chesterton, two really magnificent thinkers who are hardly known today.  All in all, I felt completely immersed in the thought and feeling of the time, so greatly influenced by fanatical political systems, gross inequality of wealth, two world wars and atomic bombs.  The converts were reacting to a fatalistic determinism and materialism that seemed to be stealing the soul of humanity, as expressed in such poems as Eliot's \\"The Waste Land\\" and \\"The Hollow Men\\".  For many people of the time, there seemed to be a choice between communism and fascism, or between communism and capitalism.  As Belloc and Chesterton saw early on, such things were false dichotomies.  The way of Faith, the return to a culture built on Christian foundations, is another choice, and the only one that can work to the benefit of all men.	2004-10-18
US	52772472	R9SML8A9FWDT8	0317530011	955353222	The Jews	Books	5	113	122	N	Y	History and Prophecy	Belloc contends that in Europe and the United States, Jews and Christians are locked in a vicious circle. Jewish elites of great ability move into a particular country where they are welcomed and prosper; masses of Jews follow and friction develops; tensions rise and Jews are expelled, or undergo persecution, or worse; the guilty nation repents, Jewish elites return, and the cycle begins anew. Belloc believes the only way out of this is for both sides to admit their own weaknesses and become honest in their relationship.  Belloc frankly evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of the Jews, and pulls no punches-neither does he do so when evaluating the serious flaws of the Christian host which so greatly frustrate the Jew.<br /><br />Writing in 1922 (with a most interesting and ominous new preface he added in 1937), Belloc observes a contrast between the cosmopolitan Jew and his landed Christian host that was definitely more pronounced than today: in a limited sense at least, citizens of nations have become more \\"Jewish\\", as advances in technology and transportation engender global connectivity and sympathies and fuzzier national identity.  Furthermore, whereas the old idea of property used to mean primarily real estate, today it has come to include ownership of tangible and practically intangible things whose origins might be anywhere on the planet.<br /><br />Regardless of such changes, there is much to be gained by reading this immensely thought-provoking book.  It is quite valuable indeed for any Jewish person seeking to better understand his roots in Western culture, how Christians perceive him, and how the atrocities of the Holocaust occurred.  Indeed, Belloc as much as predicts the Nazi extermination of Jews.  He makes an important distinction between the anti-Semite, who seeks only to destroy the Jew, and the person who perceives a Jewish problem and seeks to address it to the advantage of all parties.  Belloc in part blames the rise of anti-Semitism in the 1920's to the Jewish tendencies to secrecy and their strategy of dismissing the anti-Semite as a stupid crank.  The problem with this, Belloc contends, is that secrecy and derision undercut honest debate.  As people with real grievances, or even real perceived grievances, can get no hearing, frustration builds and eventually boils over in a desire for any redress, reasonable or not: the perfect environment for the anti-Semitic fanatic.  One can see this tendency in the USA today, mainly with respect to minorities other than Jews.  When any criticism, valid or not, is denounced as racism or sexism or extremism, debate is stifled and people grow angry.  On this point and many, many others, Belloc's insights provide both historical instruction and suggest immediate, important application to issues that are vital today.0's to the Jewish tendencies to secrecy and their strategy of dismissing the anti-Semite as a stupid crank.

Are you looking for ways to inspire more parishoners to come to church?  Ways to get them deeper into their faith?  Ways to bring unchurched people in contact with Jesus?  This book has a lot of answers.<br /><br />The format is a series of brief (10-15 page) essays written by parish leaders of \\"best practice\\" Catholic and Protestant churches that cover a wide variety of ministry topics: evangelizing, preaching, fundraising, etc.  Each topic contains two or more essays, usually with a different focus.<br /><br />Since there are so many types of churches and viewpoints represented, you will probably think some ideas sound great and other ideas don't really fit.  But it seems as though all these churches struggle with the same basic questions regardless of denomination. It's definitely possible you could pick out just one or two ideas here that could be implemented in your church and really change lives.	2004-09-23

Belloc's essays are just as timely today as when first published in 1931.  Every selection contains challenging ideas and is exceedingly well reasoned.  I was happy to find a wit and humor in his style that hadn't surfaced in other books of his I've read.  A couple highlights:<br /><br />He begins with a look at how the West is plummeting into paganism: not the enlightened paganism from which Christianity sprung, but an evil paganism determined to undo Christianity.  Since the Reformation, our fragmented faith has left us nearly defenseless against the onslaught of modern self-indulgence and fatalism.  The grim process, which Belloc detected early on, has only gained momentum.  It is disheartening to note that he holds out little hope for a reversal.  One would think this assessment would discourage him, but such is not the case.  His steadfast faith fortifies him against the vagaries of human affairs; secure in the knowledge that Christ's Church will prevail even against the gates of Hell, he writes with humor, confidence, and a reassuring calmness.  This, I think, is why Belloc can inspire as well as inform.<br /><br />The provocatively titled \\"Science as the Enemy of Truth\\" explores the evils of modern science; though his argument is far less controversial than the title would suggest, it offers real food for thought.  Belloc says science in the abstract is good, but our modern scientific community applies scientific principles where they don't belong and does so irrationally.  He argues that scientific innovation is good only when it serves the needs of the human soul, but modern science views progress as a good thing regardless of its effect on the soul. In Belloc's time the questionable moral contribution of science manifested itself in such things as eugenics, evolution, and radio.  Today we face the same questions with regard to cloning, the Internet, weapons of mass destruction, etc. Belloc's answers are emphatic and fresh.r />	2004-09-21

He puts it to good use in analyzing the five major heresies that have thwarted the Catholic Church-all of which are socially, politically, and theologically complicated matters spanning centuries.<br /><br />Conciseness is another of his writing attributes.  In a scant 160 pages, Belloc manages to fully probe Arianism, Islam, Albigensianism, the Reformation, and what he calls the \\"modern\\" heresy, which at that time had no name but contains elements of what today we might call scientific determinism, humanism, secular humanism, skepticism, or moral relativism.<br /><br />I found the discussion of Islam particularly valuable.  Prior to reading this, I had no idea how Islam spread so quickly, why so enduringly, and how it differed theologically from Christianity.  I was struck by how similar the phenomenon of Islam was to the Reformation: both movements liberated converts from oppressive taxation and other financial obligations; both involved a simplification of doctrine that appealed to the masses; both were a reaction against clericalism.  Obviously, the movements differed in that Islam attacked Catholicism from the outside, while the Reformation struck from the inside.  In Belloc's view, this existence on the fringe of Western culture explains why Islam has endured culturally and spiritually.  Ominously, Belloc closes this chapter by asking whether Islam will rise up once more to challenge the West.  Prophetically, he answers, \\"yes\\".  Islam, he maintains, has the virtue of spiritual solidarity, whereas in the West, religion, the very glue of civilization, is dissolving, leaving us irresolute, aimless and vulnerable.  A strong political leader in the Islamic world could harness the strength of this spiritually united people and overwhelm us.  Pretty relevant ideas, even though written in the 1930's.<br /><br />No less impressive is Belloc's overview of the Reformation from before Luther to his present day.  He traces the movement as seen through the eyes of those who lived through it-an illuminating technique of which Belloc is a master.  He makes any number of important points, but the most crucial, in his view, is this: that the Reformation, by splitting Christendom, diminished the importance of religion to all men.  If one religion is as good as another, if no single value system guides the behavior of men, then men will be driven by other things-acquisition of wealth, pleasure, power, what have you.  This splitting of Christendom thus paves the way for a new attack-what he calls the Modern Attack-that is wholly anti-religious and seeks nothing less than the utter destruction of faith.  We are in the midst of this attack now, and Belloc helps us understand how we got here.  Sobering reading indeedm before Luther to his present day.

On the other hand, there are a few sections that are as eloquent and insightful as anything I've read of GK.  A real problem is that this particular edition contains no footnotes whatsoever.

This novel contains three interwoven stories:<br /><br />1.  A sympathetic shape-changer who has lived on earth for millions of years, but only as a human from the 1930's on.<br /><br />2.  An unrelated and malevolent shape-changer who's been around as long as man, whose favorite human is Josef Mengele.<br /><br />3.  A mysterious and impregnable metal artifact dredged up from the ocean floor by a science reasearch team in Samoa, drawing the attention of both aliens.<br /><br />Thematically, the book is fascinating.  The decidedly non-human characters highlight oddities of our behavior we simply take for granted, like courting rituals and various aspects of sexual and romantic love.<br /><br />The plot, unfortunately, doesn't measure up.  JH starts out strong, neatly interweaving the three stories, sweeping through time and setting up a profound mystery with the artifact.  But eventually these stories bog down as JH concentrates on a love angle, pretty much dropping the more interesting (to me anyway) exploration of the artifact and the nature of the evil shape-changer.  A rather contrived ending ties it all together, but I hope he does a sequel to further develop his intriguing ideas.	2004-08-30

Chesterton: The Outline of Sanity, the Appetite of Tyranny, the Crimes of England, Lord Kitchener, Utopia of Usurers, Ho	Books	5	11	11	N	Y	More Brilliance from GKC	One thing for sure: GK was no fan of Prussia.  Volume V of  \\"Collected Works\\" contains political essays mainly dealing with events surrounding WWI.  One of my favorite selections is \\"The Crimes of England', a candid confession of his homeland's crimes against humanity.  GK lays much of the blame on Prussia, or more precisely, on England's government for cozying up to Prussia beginning with the William Pitt government around 1800.  In GK's view, England should have stood with France, as inheritors of Roman/Christian values, in opposition to barbarian Prussia.  Instead, England created a monster by propping up the Prussian regime, to the peril of all nations--particularly France, Poland, and Belgium.  Moreover, barbaric Prussian values crept into English political and intellectual life as a result of this unholy association.  English fascination with German social efficiency and scientific determinism hastened England's decline from a pastoral country to one overwhelmed by an ugly, dehumanizing urban capitalism. These are common themes in GK's writing, but I think never more fully fleshed out than here, as he traces all these developments from Pitt forward.  It's a pity Chesterton does not show up more on reading lists for Western college courses in history.	2004-08-04

XXXI)	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Fascinating Historical Document	This volume of &quot;The Collected Works&quot; contains GK's weekly essays for &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; from 1917 through 1919.  He writes mainly about the Great War, Germany, the problems of the peace, various forms of socialism, and Bolshevism. For GK, the Great War was nothing less than a battle between Christendom and barbarianism.  He pounds Prussia and Prussianism into the ground with relentlessly logical arguments, and a recounting of facts so obvious and fundamental that they seem to have been overlooked by the pacifists, socialists and other war critics  of the time.  His perspective on American culture, Wilson, The League of Nations, the Russian Revolution, Poland, France, capitalism, on and on, are truly fascinating and blend together to provide an incredibly vivid picture of the political and social forces at work in Europe in this enormously complicated and tumultuous period.

As always, GK is illuminating and entertaining--several parts of these essays had me laughing out loud.  GK has a marvelous talent for utterly dismantling an argument, an attitude, or a belief, while remaining so good natured about it that even his intellectual enemies must have liked him at least a little.  Here, he mainly takes on Protestantism, modernism, secularism, Liberalism, and several other &quot;isms&quot; of the day that challenged the Catholic Church--some of which at one time or another had even attracted GK himself.  In the end, he makes as convincing an argument for Catholicism that anyone could make. In the process, he throws much light on many political and social trends that were just gearing up in the 1920's, like birth control, divorce, moral relativism and secular humanism.  GK offers grave predictions for these insufficient ideas, many of which sadly have come true beyond probably even his imagination.	2004-05-17

I became interested in reading the \\"Dolorous Passion\\" when I heard that Mel Gibson had used it as a source for \\"The Passion\\".  Some observations about the book and the film:<br /><br />The book actually contains far more graphic violence than the film.  The brutal treatment of Our Lord's final hours is related in excruciating detail.  If anything, Gibson sanitized the story somewhat by skipping over some of the action and not dwelling as much as Emmerich on the attitudes of the bloodthirsty throng.<br />I could find no anti-Semitism in the book.  If Emmerich sees anyone as being responsible for Jesus' death, it is Satan himself.  Time and time again she describes how Satan takes full possession of the angry mob and Roman soldiers as their blood lust reaches full crescendo.<br />In the film, Pilate (I thought) is portrayed as a somewhat noble character with a deeply troubled conscience.  In the book, he is depicted as pathetically weak, duplicitous and cowardly, content to sacrifice innocent blood just to keep himself out of trouble.<br />The timeless quality of Our Lord's sacrifice comes across powerfully in the book.  In Gesthemani, Sister Emmerich tells us how all of our sins-past, present, and future-appear before Him, as he takes them all upon Himself for our salvation.  With all the meticulous detail of the twelve hours, it is easy to forget that for God, past, present and future are all one: our sins today hurt Him just as much as those committed by those who clamored for his crucifixion.  That is a tough concept to get across in a film, and maybe a reason for the charges of anti-Semitism brought against it.  On this topic and others, I think the book can help to clarify the message of the movie.	2004-03-16

Although the sexual scandal is nominally the focal point of the book, Gibson sees all of its horrors as a symptom of a deeper problem; namely, a Church whose fixation on the structure and form of worship blinds it to the human problems caused by that structure.  He examines these human problems and possible solutions as seen from three perspectives: the laity, the priesthood, and the hierarchy. He neatly lays out Church history to show how it has shaped current happenings and conditions.  His book is well researched, clearly written, and generally balanced.  He is not, however, impartial.  He lays most of the blame for the sexual scandal on the American bishops and Vatican Curia, seeing these bodies as arrogant, cut off from the \\"real world\\", and protective of their power based in part on centuries-old relationships with priests and the laity that have become dehumanizing and ultimately, unsustainable.  As one might expect from an American journalist, Gibson believes the solution is less emphasis on structure, less unquestioned central authority, and more involvement from the laity in Church affairs.  As he describes the heartrending experiences of various lay members and priests who have been victimized and ignored by \\"the system\\", one begins to feel that Gibson has a point.	2004-02-24

My favorite selections were:<br />&quot;The Pasternak Affair&quot; is a penetrating analysis of Pasternak's work and his poetic struggle to be human in a harshly dehumanizing communist society.  In addition, Merton's commentary touches on how our own &quot;free&quot; society is in a much more insidious way nearly as dehumanizing.  Clearly, Merton, who had some correspondence with Pasternak, dearly loved the man and his work.<br />&quot;The Power and Meaning of Love&quot; is one of the most beautiful explorations of what it means to love and be loved that I have read.<br />&quot;Philosophy of Solitude&quot; boldly asserts that we are all solitaries; the only question is whether we accept it or run away from it.  Society, in a sense, is nothing more than a structure of distractions that enables us to ignore our intrinsic lonliness.  However, if we turn and face our solitary nature, we can discover that we are not empty at all, but full of God. Merton explains with magnificent clarity how we should pursue this discovery, and how to avoid the pitfalls that can lead us, with the best of spiritual intentions, astray.<br />Very hard to go wrong with this book!	2004-02-16

O'Hare prefaces his well-researched and heavily quoted study of Luther by saying excessive language and emotion on all sides have degraded and clouded the whole Luther controversy.  To clear the air, O'Hare proposes to damn Luther with his own words, and set the editorializing aside.  O'Hare patiently explains that the testimony of Luther himself, along with that of his collaborators and subsequent Protestant authorities, will speak for itself.  But then directly on the heels of this modest disclaimer, he proceeds to unleash a merciless and caustic invective against Luther that lets up for nary a page throughout the remainder of the 350-page text.  Certainly, the Father's strident tone arises partly from his belief in the absolute authority of the Catholic Church, and partly as a response to the even more venomous (yet far less reasoned) tongue of his subject.  Style issues aside, the book indeed presents a damning portrait of the Reformer: Luther's own words indeed betray his irrational, dismal and inconsistent theology, his vindictive and monstrously self-sufficient nature, his almost insanely personal, vituperative and frequently scatological method of argument.<br />Between citations and diatribes, O'Hare manages to provide quite lucid explanations of the very complex concepts of Indulgences and Justification-concepts mangled by Luther to appeal to the basest instincts of his fledgling flock.  Thanks in no small measure to him, multitudes to this day deplore the Mother Church based on a completely erroneous understanding of Indulgences and Justification.<br />O'Hare convincingly demonstrates that far from introducing the Bible to the German masses, Luther merely eviscerated extant German translations in order to make it conform to his heretical theology.<br />Luther's schizophrenic message which exhorted man to interpret Scripture for himself yet condemned him whenever he disagreed with Luther's own mercurial teachings had dire consequences throughout Europe--social chaos on the one hand, and brutal authoritarianism on the other. Luther got the ball rolling by inducing the German peasants to revolt against their oppressive princes, and then turned on them when they no longer obeyed.  Outraged, he changed sides and encouraged these same princes to exterminate the peasants with gleeful abandon.  The princes were only too happy to oblige.<br />One suspects that O'Hare, certainly no ecumenist, undermines his case by overstating it.  Surely there must be a good side to Luther, for no sane person could have followed the disgusting embodiment of evil portrayed in these pages.  That the book has received the Imprimatur will reassure Catholic readers, but probably make some non-Catholic readers more skeptical.<br />Regardless of to what extent O'Hare caricaturizes Luther the man, he is lucid and compelling when assessing Luther the theologian.  All the contradictory, dehumanizing, illogical, and downright nonsensical elements of Luther's belief system are exposed and refuted.  One wonders how he attracts followers at all.  O'Hare himself offers an explanation: either they ignore his theology, misinterpret it, or change it.  Nevertheless, Luther's theology took the Real out of Presence, the Divine out of Scripture, and the Revealed out of Religion.

He is best known for \\"Death Be Not Proud\\", the story of his son, who tragically died of a brain tumor at age 17.  Gunther traveled extensively through Europe circa 1936, interviewing political leaders and assessing the climate all throughout.  His analysis of Hitler, the possibilities for war, and the social turmoil working its way through almost all of Europe make for fascinating reading, knowing what is soon to come.

Today its ideas lurk more subtly behind such movements as birth control, abortion rights, euthanasia, and cloning.  So, this book by GK is far more than an historical curiosity; the arguments he sets forth enable us to see far more clearly the dangers of conceding to a government, a group of elites, or even a vague movement, even a fraction of our rights and responsibilities concerning our own life, death, and progeneration.  In the first third of the book, GK utterly dismantles the superficial logic of eugenics.  In the second third, he exposes the real objectives of the movement that lay beneath the surface.  The final third is a compilation of truly bone chilling articles and letters written by eugenicists of the period.  Essentially, GK believes that the movement arose out of the capitalist desire to maintain cheap labor and the socialist desire to scientifically organize society.  His analysis of these seemingly opposed forces has a heavy political, social, and historical focus, and is surprisingly light on religious considerations.  He foresees that eugenics unleashed would result in an utterly inhuman society.  Unfortunately the Nazis proved his theory.  He foresees the dehumanizing effects of even a more moderate eugenics, which unfortunately has come to pass and is quite evident in the monstrous plight of our poor, homeless, mentally handicapped, and unborn.  How do these social horrors occur?  GK believes that most people are right, but dont know that they are right.  Thus theywe--are susceptible and even defenseless to attacks by an organized group of activists driven by malevolent or merely foolish motives.  This book shows how that actually played out in pre-WWII Europe, and gives us a better understanding of how it is happening now, and how we might reverse course.we might reverse course.	2003-12-15

Although Belloc was an ardent Catholic, he is surprisingly balanced in his analysis; for instance he pulls no punches when critiquing the shortcomings of the Church, and is quite mild in his assessment of Martin Luther.  (Belloc is most venomous toward the British upper classes, who so shamelessly exploited the Church, Elizabeth, and the common people merely to increase their personal wealth and solidify their political position.  His analysis is undoubtedly contrary to mainstream English history, but is compellingly supported by the facts.)  Belloc's greatest strength is his ability to distill general principles and underlying causes from the tidal wave of political and social upheaval that was pouring across Europe.  Thus the book is a fantastic starting point for a study of the Reformation.  Although it is short on details (especially military details) it provides a very clear context.	2003-12-10

Having found the first four Vampire books absolutely riveting, I was a tad disappointed here:  \\"B and G\\" is not as tightly written, the characters are not quite as compelling and the plot is more episodic and meandering.  Just the same, I enjoyed it.  Marius, the Blood Drinker with the soul of an artist, succeeds and suffers mightily across the centuries, but heroically stays true to his creed.  Yet, because of his supercharged powers and all too human weaknesses, his relationships unravel as they might for you or me, but in epic proportions.  So in many ways Marius seems the least strange and most accessible of the Blood Drinkers, all throughout The Chronicles.  Also, the book features wonderfully detailed depictions of life in ancient Rome and Constantinople, Renaissance Italy, and 18th century northern Europe-a great treat for the historically minded reader.  Definitely a worthwhile read!	2003-12-03

One thing this book makes clear is that although the socio-political names change, the game remains the same.  GK takes a hard look at what's wrong with England in 1910, and his diagnosis works just as well for America in 2003.  GK rails against capitalism and socialism, for both philosophies are equally dehumanizing-capitalism excuses inhumanity as a cost of doing business; socialism seeks to redefine humanity by stripping away from us all that is human.  Politicians, thinkers, and civic leaders on both ends of the spectrum flail away at social problems by attacking symptoms-poverty, homelessness, the role of women in society, disintegration of the family, unfruitful education-but consistently make the symptoms worse because they never see the underlying problem.  What is the underlying problem?  It is that our leaders no longer put the individual, which is human and therefore sacred, above the social organization, which is merely artificial and expendable. By dismissing the laws of God, we have nothing left but an anarchy of ideas.  We have replaced one law of God with a thousand laws of social theory.  GK shows how such an unfocused and confused approach has steadily worsened the plight of the poor, the family, the publicly educated man, etc., and predicts that Western social fabric will only unravel further, as long as we keep this up. Unfortunately for us, we have, and GK's predictions are correct.	2003-11-30

I'm down 12 pounds, and feel much more fit. For me the most amazing thing has been the complete disappearance of food cravings. I used to come home from work and eat anything I could get my hands on. This would drive my wife crazy as she was preparing dinner, which I would proceed to wolf down and then start munching on crackers, chips, whatever: you name it, I'd eat it. This had been going on for years, and all the while, I thought I was doing myself a favor because I was maintaining a nice healthy low fat diet. I guess I overlooked the fact that in three years my weight had ballooned from 185 to almost 230! When a co-worker who'd been on the diet for six months with super results started telling me about it, I was intrigued. I did a fair amount of research and finally decided to pull the trigger. So far, so good. And, as nice as the weight loss has been, the emotional and psychological benefits are even better: no compulsive urges to eat, no more guilt because no more gorging. The diet has definitely had a calming effect.<br />It's obvious from the reviews Atkins affects people differently. But whether you try Atkins or not, I highly recommend the book because it will force you rethink your whole concept of nutrition. If you end up doing nothing more than cutting back on junk food, you'll be doing yourself a huge favor. (In fact, I can hardly imagine anyone reading this book and not thinking twice about the next can of pop, bag of potato chips, or jelly donut.) If you look at the evidence and decide to give the diet a try, there's every reason to think you'll be glad you did.<br />Update from 10-02...Been on pre-maintenance faithfully,weight down from 230 to 205 and dropping slowly but steadily. Feel great. More energy. Just got a blood test: triglycerides down big and HDL's up, but overall cholesterol and LDL's up big. I may have to modify my diet to bring the numbers down.	2003-11-18

Indeed, in his introduction, he describes his own spiritual journey that way: he likens himself to a British explorer setting sail in his yacht who winds up discovering England. He begins by explaining the limitations of reason, pointing out that men go mad not by losing their reason, but by losing everything except their reason.  GK says poets seek to get their heads into the heavens, but rationalists seek to get heaven into their heads.  This latter process can (not must) lead to madness.  Next, GK considers the leading philosophies of his day-pragmatism, determinism, and Nietzche's theory of Will-in light of this excessive rationalism.  He sums up neatly: \\"A man was meant to be doubtful about himself, but undoubting about the truth; this has been exactly reversed. Nowadays the part of a man that a man does assert is exactly the part he ought not to assert himself. The part he doubts is exactly the part he ought not to doubt -- the Divine Reason.\\"  On the ensuing pages GK shows how Christianity alone provides the key for how one is to live.  A few aspects of his arguments struck me as exceptional.  His arguments are eminently reasonable, not mystical appeals to faith.  His arguments consider the whole of man, from the broadest possible historical, psychological, and political perspectives.  His arguments are balanced: he is unafraid to point out the weaknesses of his position and the strengths of another.  Finally, his arguments are imbued with a gentility, humility and lightheartedness that are sorely lacking in our public debate.  It is a rare thing to be persuasive on questions of religious belief and morality; GK not only manages to pull it off, he provides a few chuckles in the bargain.	2003-11-17

Although the book is meticulously researched, heavily footnoted, focused on facts and rather blandly written, it made my skin crawl.  Just four of the many things I was shocked to learn:<br />Planned Parenthood is the leading proabortion organization.  Its founder, Margaret Sanger, was a proponent of eugenics-the pseudoscience of racial purity that reached full bloom in Nazi Germany.  PP has never renounced her beliefs.<br />Women who have induced abortions are at much higher risk to develop breast cancer-a well documented medical fact that is suppressed in mainstream media and abortion clinics.<br />Ironically, women are doubly exploited by abortion, first by abortionists, who make millions doing these operations, and also through sex-selection abortions (perfectly legal) that reduce the number of female births.<br />A partial-birth abortion means the baby is delivered live except for his head, which remains in the birth canal.  A scissors is then jammed into the base of his skull so his brains can be sucked out.  God have mercy on us.<br />Robert Jay Lifton's \\"The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide\\" is occasionally referenced by Alcorn.  Having read that bone-chilling trail of eugenics theory to death camp exterminations, I could see many parallels to the prochoice special interest: the weak are deemed expendable by the strong; beliefs are wrapped around pseudoscientific \\"principles\\" to make them appear credible; euphemisms replace plain language to sanitize the underlying inhumanity.<br />There is much to be learned here.  I hope and pray that prochoice people read this: if they have the courage to do so they will truly put their beliefs to the test.  Mostly I hope expectant mothers and couples read this before choosing abortion, so they can make an informed choice.	2003-11-03

Chesterton traces the development of religion from cave man to Christian in this comprehensive and compelling work of Catholic apologetics.  He begins by convincingly (if somewhat repetitively) taking apart the theory of evolution, demonstrating that the evolutionist's coldly secular, sociological explanations of prehistoric man's religious development have no basis in fact.  He next turns to the pagan world with a mesmerizing analysis of the supreme conflict between the Romans, who represented the best of paganism, and the Carthaginians, who represented the worst.  A victorious Carthage would have plunged humanity into an abyss of devil-worshipping inhumanity; Rome, by fighting against all odds for an ennobling vision of man, family and society, established a civilization human enough to receive Jesus Christ.  Upon turning to our Lord, Chesterton elegantly dismantles a variety of arguments against His divinity, showing how all interpretations of Jesus that are less than the Gospels are, in the end, less believable and less rational than the Gospels.  The Church is then compared and contrasted to Hinduism, Confucianism, Islam, and Buddhism.  In Chesterton's view, Islam is \\"militant but no church\\", and these other belief systems are essentially pagan mythologies; the critical point is none of these systems rises to the level of Christianity in terms of spiritual relevance and truth.  He then delves deep into the Eastern mind, rooted in a changeless, cavernous past, contrasting it to Western mind, profoundly and utterly recast by the relatively recent Incarnation.  His analysis culminates with magnificent insights on Christianity as a story: philosophies are static and circular, ending where they begin, whereas Christianity stands alone as a philosophy that moves, initially with the journey of Christ, and then with the spiritual journeys that we ourselves must make.  Thus Christianity alone can inspire us and teach us how to move forward and upward, spiritually and in all other ways.  It is a greater philosophy than all other philosophies for this reason, and it is a greater story than other stories because it is true.  Great ideas and historical insights abound in this work.  I can't imagine anyone, regardless of his religion or non-religion, reading this and not being moved somewhere, somehow.n all other ways.

She etches out a dismal picture-full of gray and rain and pain and indifference.  I'm not sure exactly what she had in mind, but this is how it struck me...I think Hazel Motes is already dead when the story begins, killed in the war after enduring great physical and emotional pain.  He never talks about his combat experiences, and from his bitter silence we can infer his overwhelming sense of guilt and disillusion.  He cannot reconcile the inhumanity he's experienced with a notion of Jesus that is just words to him.  So when his train reaches Taulkinham, the scene of his cleansing, he preaches the Church Without Christ.  He proclaims Jesus to be a liar.  Man has not been redeemed.  If we were redeemed, there would be some evidence somewhere-but there isn't.  And indeed, the townsfolk make his case.  Asa Hawks is a loathsome fraud.  His daughter, Sabbath, luxuriates in her moral corruption.  Enoch Emory-the outsider with \\"wise blood\\"-laments that nobody in town will shake his hand.  People stare at the street in somber silence as they go through the motions of life. Taulkinham is all hate and crass self-interest, literally a town bereft of redemption.  Taulkinham is a dirty reflection of Haze's own soul: his accusatory preaching bounces indifferently off his few pitiful listeners and back into him, driving him to greater exasperation and violence.  The more he rails against judgment, the more surely he feels himself judged.  The more he feels himself judged, the more he denies his judge.  Finally, after a crowning act of defiance, he tries to leave town, but is rebuffed by a policeman who pushes his car off a cliff with the coolness of a man buttering toast.  At this point Haze moves from defiance to acceptance, and undertakes to cleanse himself.  He subjects himself to every form of pain and torment he can devise, and waits patiently for salvation.  Eventually, his landlady, Mrs. Flood, attempts to ease his pain for mainly selfish motives.  Haze sees through her easily despite his blindness.  He suddenly knows it is time to go; his blood is now \\"wise\\"-it tells him what to do without him needing to think it.  Go where?, Mrs. Flood asks.  He goes off to escape his purgatory, of course, and after a few days wandering around in the freezing cold, he winds up near death, seemingly nowhere.

While I agree, the sheer volume of detail does give the reader a clear sense of everyday life in Judea, and the unsustainable separation between a Jewish religious leadership immersed in the form of worship and the Jewish people, who could find no spiritual nourishment in the cold, arcane legality of Jewish tradition.  Although George claims to follow the Episcopal and Catholic tradition (whatever that means), her theology certainly doesn't reflect it.  At best, she dances around the concept of Christ's divinity and the True Presence, and goes out of her way to reject the notion of an apostolic church.  While such views are obviously widespread, I found it very curious indeed that she would make Jesus dependent on Mary: there are a few points in the narrative where Jesus says he must know her visions in order to proceed on his holy mission.  Well, for revisionist Christianity, I'd suggest \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" by Kazantakis-it's far more coherent and provocative.  For a taste of the life and times of Jesus, \\"Mary\\" is ok, but don't expect much more.	2003-07-08

Of the many themes Merton emphasizes in explaining true solitude, gratitude and humility are perhaps the most important.  To live in solitude is to be without attachment to material things, personal relationships, or even spiritual accomplishment.  Therefore solitude is a life of utter poverty and humility: our entire lives are a gift to God.  Through this act we discover that nothing is due us, and our lives become an ongoing prayer of gratitude for whatever gifts we receive.  For the true solitary, actions are far more important than thoughts, because, as Merton points out, if our ideas are not reflected in our actions, we do not really think them.  If we do not follow our true vocation our lives will be choked by internal conflict between what we are called to do and what we actually do.  Or worse, we may avoid the problem by ignoring our spiritual condition.  Merton's commentary is highly relevant to all who care about their spiritual condition, and all who seek God in the murderous din.	2003-06-25
US	52772472	R13HR8TDRO7AFK	0814604129	842104187	Thomas Merton:  Spiritual Direction And Meditation	Books	5	89	89	N	Y	Powerful Reading	This slender but powerful volume is divided into two fifty-page essays. The first discusses spiritual direction and is aimed mainly at the religious; the second covers the practice of meditation and speaks more to the lay reader.<br />Merton's commentary on direction is incisive as always. He has a nasty habit of confronting me with my human weaknesses just when I think I've made a little spiritual progress. My spirituality must not be compartmentalized, it must encompass my every thought and action: holiness is not simply a matter of going to church every Sunday, it's how I brush my teeth. Further, my spiritual life must not become enslaved to form; it is all about substance. If the essence of my being is committed to the Holy Spirit, if love for God infuses my every thought and action, I will discern my vocation and conduct my life in harmony with His will. Certainly, a lay person may need guidance in this discernment, but for a religious, whose vocation is spiritual \\"perfection\\", it is imperative. Without proper guidance, and a lot of it, proper formation is impossible and the result is often a lost soul. Merton explains what a spiritual director should be, and perhaps more important, what he should not be. Very few of us can discern God's will in solitude-most of us need to talk things out, even if, as Merton points out, it is only a matter of hearing confirmation of what we already know in our heart.<br />Merton's commentary on meditation includes everything from explaining the true goal of meditation (union with God) to teaching the basics (e.g., it's best to meditate when seated). His primer is must reading for anyone interested in meditation, or anyone wishing to improve his/her prayer life in general.	2003-06-16

A chimp with a teenager girl's brain must fend for herself after her brilliant father/creator dies.  A poignant exploration of the best and worst in human nature.  B<br />\\"Dream Baby\\" by Bruce McCallister.  A young volunteer nurse in Viet Nam begins having prophetic nightmares about soldiers getting butchered in combat.  Scary, graphically violent.  B<br />`\\"Flowers of Edo\\" by Bruce Sterling.  Seemingly straight fictional account of East meets West in 1860's Japan explodes with a supernatural surprise at the end.  As usual, Sterling conjures up intriguing characters and astonishingly vivid prose.  A<br />\\"Forever Yours, Anna\\" by Kate Wilhelm.  World-weary divorced graphologist falls in love with an unknown woman's handwriting.  Moving character study with an elegant surprise finish.  A<br />\\"At the Cross-Time Jaunter's Ball\\" by Alexander Jablokov.  A tongue-in-cheek look at the love-hate relationship between artist and critic is the highlight of this meandering story about a man cut adrift in an ever-changing sea of alternate worlds.  C<br /> \\"Dinosaurs\\" by Walter Jon Williams. How will we evolve over the next six million years?  That's the subject of this spellbinder about an eighteen-foot tall human diplomat who comes to a planet of inferior canine creatures to hammer out a peace treaty.  Brilliant scientific speculation (humans bioengineer everything, including the furniture), and dialog crackling with trenchant social and political satire. A+<br />\\"The Temporary King\\" by Paul J. McAuley.  Mysterious offworld traveler/adventurer drops in on a backwoods Earth village and stirs the pot big time.  C+<br />\\"Perpetuity Blues\\" by Neal Barrett, Jr.  Girl reared by degenerate uncle.  Zzzz.<br />\\"Buffalo Gals, Won't You Come Out Tonight\\" by Ursula K. LeGuin.  Girl reared by magic coyote.  Zzzz.<br />\\"The Pardoner's Tale\\" by Robert Silverberg.  Squid-like entities enslave Earth, save for a handful of artful hackers who can manipulate their intricate computer identification systems.  While in Los Angeles, the cleverest of them all falls into an even cleverer trap.  B<br />\\"Glass Cloud\\" by James Patrick Kelly.  Kelly's aliens enslave humans far more subtly than Silverberg's, but just as surely.  In the near future, a frustrated architect ponders his broken marriage, his future, and metaphysics under the growing influence of an inscrutable alien presence.  B<br />\\"The Morning and the Evening and the Night\\" by Octavia E. Butler.  The cure for cancer leads to an even more horrific disease, with which a tight-knit group of young afflicted must come to terms.  As in Butler's \\"Bloodchild\\" from the Second Annual, cannibalistic gore stands in stark contrast to a tender exploration of the human condition.  B<br />\\"Night of the Cooters\\" by Howard Waldrop.  A few of H.G. Wells' Martians get off track and land in a sleepy Texas cow town.  True to form, the cooters fire up their flame-throwers, but the Texans stay cool.  Snappy narrative peppered with humorous Old West jargon.  B<br />\\"Angel\\" by Pat Cadigan.  A couple of misfits-one human, one not-team up to get more out of life.  C<br />\\"Shades\\" by Lucius Shepard.  A journalist is lured back to Viet Nam to meet the ghost of his former squad leader.  The psychodrama is slightly less compelling than in his earlier Best contributions, but still good.  B<br />\\"The Faithful Companion at Forty\\" by Karen Joy Fowler.  A bit of whimsy about Tonto and his labor of love, The Lone Ranger.  B<br />\\"Candle in a Cosmic Wind\\" by Joseph Manzione.  Wow.  The author's first published story is a tour de force of well-articulated hard science, dazzling plot, and fantastic characterization, revolving around a female Soviet soldier who is the sole survivor of an all-out nuclear war.  Full of surprises!  A+<br />\\"The Emir's Clock\\" by Ian Watson.  God sends us a message, but notthe one we want to hear.  C<br />\\"Ever After\\" by Susan Patwick.  As Dozois observes, we see the \\"gritty underside\\" of a fairy tale-a Cinderella story of deadly court intrigues and sinister magic.  B<br />\\"The Forest of Time\\" by Michael F. Flynn.  Thought-provoking alternate history: in a somber, balkanized North America, a faltering Pennsylvanian army captures a traveler from our world. The soldiers can't decide whether he's a spy, a madman-or an opportunity.  A<br />\\"The Million-Dollar Wound\\" by Dean Whitlock.  Soldiers in a surgically advanced near future can't get injured badly enough to buy a ticket home.  C<br />\\"Moon of the Popping Trees\\" by R. Garcia y Robinson.  With Indians on the verge of annihilation at Wounded Knee, a medicine man has relativistic visions of peace that baffle a local schoolteacher.  C<br />\\"Diner\\" by Neal Barrett, Jr.  Zzzz.<br />\\"All the Hues of Hell\\" by Gene Wolfe.  Zzzz.<br />\\"Halley's Passing\\" by Michael McDowell.  Sickeningly violent slice of a meticulous murderer's life.  D<br />\\"America\\" by Orson Scott Card.  The Lord reenacts his Incarnation to avenge the sins of Western man.  Or something like that: paradoxically, this clearly and skillfully written narrative is a thematic hodgepodge of environmentalism, mysticism, anti-Catholicism and anti-capitalism.  D<br />\\"For Thus Do I Remember Carthage\\" by Michael Bishop.  Saint Augustine's long lost son returns from Cathay to confront him with what we know as modern scientific knowledge and gadgets.  The dying Augustine bitterly rejects him and them.  As with oh, so many stories in this volume, the point eludes me.  C<br />\\"Mother Goddess of the World\\" by Kim Stanley Robinson.  A lighthearted adventure about climbing Everest.  Not nearly as good as Robinson's previous Best contributions.  CBR>\\"Ever After\\" by Susan Patwick.

He awards first prize for the disaster to King Philip, a first-rate numbskull whose foolhardy strategy and tactics doomed the fleet before it ever left port. Thanks to him, Spain has been a second-class power ever since. Duke Medina Sedonia, fleet commander, gets far more sympathetic treatment than his boss: despite having not a shred of military or nautical experience, he displays heroic courage and equanimity in the face of near hopeless odds. Besides these two, Horwath delves deep into the personalities of many other key participants on both sides, including Drake, Frobisher, the de Valdes cousins, Recalde, and the energetically inactive Duke of Parma. The narrative is compact yet sweeping: in a mere 250 pages, Horwath gives good account of the religious and political motives behind the mission, the military strengths and weaknesses of both sides, tactical and strategic developments in sixteenth century naval warfare, and the misery endured by the sailors and soldiers of the Armada. He describe of the various fates of the doomed Spaniards with heart-wrenching passion, but includes some rousing tales of survival and escape that truly lift the spirit. Well done!	2003-05-09

Not quite as good as the First Collection, but just as hard to find.<br />1. \\"Salvador\\" by Lucius Shepard. Tense, poignant story of a young soldier struggling to survive a nerve-racking guerilla war in a lush, surreal jungle. Beautifully written with a brilliant ending that is subtle, shocking, and sad. Shepard kicked off the Fourth Annual with the formidable \\"R & R\\", also about troubled soldiers in a future Central American war, but this effort is stronger. A+<br />2. \\"Promises to Keep\\" by Jack McDevitt. Standard space opera fare about a crippled space ship limping home from Jupiter's moons. C<br />3. \\"Bloodchild\\" by Octavia E. Butler. Not for the squeamish. Wormlike aliens love humans, not for their minds, but for their bodies, in a most unusual way. Great realism lies at the heart of this strange tale: the interspecies relationships have all the depth, tension and complexity of human ones. A+<br />4. \\"Blued Moon\\" by Connie Willis. Same problem here as in her First Annual contribution, \\"The Sidon in the Mirror\\": tricked-up linguistics in the dialog detracts from an otherwise passable story. This one takes a lighthearted look at the unexpected side effects of improper hazardous waste disposal. C<br />5. \\"A Message to the King of Brobdingnag\\" by Richard Cowper. Crop researcher looking to cure world hunger fails spectacularly. Tautly written, laced with irony. A<br />6. \\"The Affair\\" by Robert Silverberg. Man and woman with rich psychic powers connect for a long-distance mental yet highly sensual affair. Thought-provoking examination of where the boundaries lie-or don't lie-between physical and spiritual love. A<br />7. \\"Press Enter []\\" by John Varley. Set around 1984, this spooky speculation on computer networks makes for an interesting read in 2003...Two Southern California misfits fall in love as they uncover lethal secrets lurking in the burgeoning Internet. However-fuzzy plot undermines sharp characters. B<br />8. \\"New Rose Hotel\\" by William Gibson. The day of reckoning draws near for a twenty-first century gangster holed up in the New Rose Hotel. Bleak and shadowy, it's a film noir in print: the protagonist's eleventh-hour confession reads like Fred MacMurray's clipped narrative in \\"Double Indemnity\\". B<br />9. \\"The Map\\" by Gene Wolfe. Not a big fantasy fan, so NR.<br />10. \\"Interlocking Pieces\\" by Molly Gloss. Brief but emotionally powerful examination of medical transplanting ratcheted up a notch, featuring a pair of tragic, touchingly human patients. A<br />11. \\"Trojan Horse\\" by Michael Swanick. The world's first total personality transplant causes massive confusion for the recipient...and the reader. D<br />12. \\"Bad Medicine\\" by Jack M. Dann. Man in the spiritual wilderness seeks truth by participating in a violent Indian exorcism ceremony. C<br />13. \\"At the Embassy Club\\" by Elizabeth A. Lynn. Romantic fairytale set on an alien planet with a complex, highly ritualistic Oriental-like culture. C<br />14. \\"Pursuit of Excellence\\" by Rena Yount. Twenty-first century married couple struggle with the harsh socio-economic realities of bioengineering their progeny. Their uncomfortably realistic tale of woe is perhaps more relevant today than when it was written. A-<br />15. \\"The Kindly Isle\\" by Frederik Pohl. A widower haunted by his past gradually finds happiness on a business trip to a tropical island. But wait! Everybody around here is happy--and he thinks he knows why. Complex, appealing characters and plot: a refreshing change from the gloomy, cynical or outright cataclysmic perspectives so prevalent in short sci-fi. A<br />16. \\"Rock On\\" by Pat Cadigan. Set in the near future, a barely comprehensible, abrasively written, but mercifully short story about a psycho-invasive rock and roll creative process...or something. D<br />17. \\"Sunken Gardens\\" by Bruce Sterling. Sterling's vivid imagination and descriptive brilliance carry this Mechanist/Shaper story about a high stakes terraforming contest among posthuman sects. B+<br />18. \\"Trinity\\" by Nancy Kress. Loathsome entomologist manipulates sister and clone brother in attempt to keep them from participating in an experiment to scientifically verify the existence of God. Kress roasts atheists and believers with equal gusto, leaving us with an indigestible hash of hopeless negativity. D-<br />19. \\"The Trouble with the Cotton People\\" by Ursula K. LeGuin. In just a few pages, LeGuin paints an extraordinarily vivid picture of a future barter based world, as seen through the eyes of a young, plain spoken traveler. B<br />20. \\"Twilight Time\\" by Lewis Shiner. A man from a politically oppressive near future time travels back to a defining moment of his youth and encounters things expected and unexpected. Suspenseful, nostalgic, well crafted, with evocative characters and an impressive catalog of 1950's Americana. A+<br />21. \\"Black Coral\\" by Lucius Shepard. A nasty American on a decaying Caribbean island gets his during a heavy-duty bender of drinks, drugs, and voodoo. A lush, dizzying kaleidoscope of terror. B<br />22. \\"Friend\\" by James Patrick Kelly & John Kessel. Twisted love triangle onboard an interstellar passenger ship. B<br />23. \\"Foreign Skins\\" by Tanith Lee. Young British boy in Colonial India becomes a man (quite literally) in a supernatural trial by fire when a mysterious woman secrets him away to her world of shape changing, reptilian demigods. B<br />24. \\"Company in the Wings\\" by R. A. Lafferty. Psst: imaginary characters populate alternate realities. C<br />25. \\"A Cabin on the Coast\\" by Gene Wolfe. Man on holiday with his girlfriend walks (swims, actually) into a magical illusion, and through it discovers the terrible reality beneath. Sharply written, fantastically finished. A+<br />26. \\"The Lucky Strike\\" by Kim Stanley Robinson. Robinson seems to favor stories about men slowly being squeezed in a vise of hostile circumstances. In this one, the bombardier in an alternate reality sweats out his bombing run to Hiroshima. Taut, action-packed, vivid and realistic in both description and characterization. A+.

Court intrigues abound in this highly stylized, far future techno-medieval world at the crossroads. The author's eye for imaginative detail is remarkable. A<br />\\"Beyond the Dead Reef\\"¨ by James Tiptree, Jr. (Alice Sheldon). Spine-tingling science-horror with a diver stranded out beyond a ghostly and ghastly reef. Features one of the most terrifying and palpable images I can recall in science-fiction. A+<br />\\"Slow Birds\\" by Ian Watson. Speaking of powerful images, the slow birds inhabiting this far future, pastoral Earth are utterly fascinating, along with the strange doom they portend. Wonderful plot, well crafted characters. A+<br />\\"Vulcan's Forge\\" by Poul Anderson. Curmudgeonly scientist on Mercury has an unusual relationship with his female colleague&iexcl;and his space probe. Excellent hard science, but alas the plot is predictable. C<br />\\"Man-Mountain Gentian\\" by Howard Waldrop. Sumo wrestlers in 2014 find new applications for Zen. Clever, entertaining story with a couple marvelous characters and an appropriately enigmatic, Zen-like finish. A<br />\\"Hardfought\\" by Greg Bear. Dozios' preface says it well: \\"...a brilliant tour-de-force about the interplay between science and history that takes us simultaneously to the far reaches of the universe and deep inside the hearts of our distant descendants--people so changed by the consequence of a millennia-long war that they have become nearly as alien as the enigmatic enemy they fight...\\" Bear pushes scientific speculation to the imaginative limits. A+<br />\\"Manifest Destiny\\" by Joe Haldeman. After exercising my brain on \\"Hardfought\\", I enjoyed taking a breather with this amusing, cleverly written memoir about fortunes--material and ethereal--in the Old West. A<br />\\"Full Chicken Richness\\" by Avram Davidson. Quirky, choppy and above all silly time-travel story about an underachieving entrepreneur. C<br /><br />\\"Multiples\\", by Richard Silverberg. If you think dating is tough with only one personality each... As always Silverberg writes with great clarity, but here, his premise seems completely implausible. C<br /><br />\\"Cryptic\\" by Jack McDevitt. Skillful combination of mystery, suspense, and science as a bored SETI physicist/administrator gets out of his rut grappling with a cryptic message from space and an equally cryptic warning from a predecessor. A<br />\\"The Sidon in the Mirror\\" by Connie Willis. Youthful anti-hero takes on cunning villain to aid damsel in distress in a frontier mining town...on a distant dying sun. The offworld dialect is highly distracting, making the whole thing hard to follow. C-<br />\\"Golden Gate\\" by R. A. Lafferty. Reality blurs for a man watching a melodrama in a bizarre bar. Although Laffety's idiosyncratic style isn't for me, I did like his description of the villain as having \\"arms like a python.\\" C<br />\\"Blind Shemmy\\" by Jack Dann. Grisly tale about some very literal mind games in a future Paris casino, as two thrill seeking, adversarial gamblers play their hearts out. Literally. A-<br />\\"In the Islands\\" by Pat Murphy. Young marine biologist in the Caribbean agonizes over the imminent loss of his mutant friend to the sea. C<br />\\"Nunc Dimittis\\" by Tanith Lee. (Title from Luke, 2:29: \\"Now Master, you may let your servant go in peace.\\") Tanith Lee's brooding, gothic voice speaks hauntingly in this melancholy story of a loyal but aging servant, his streetwise replacement-to-be, and the seductive vampire princess to whom they are drawn. Lee serves up dark reflections on love, mortality, and immortality as seen from each of their three very different perspectives. A+<br />\\"Blood Music\\" by Greg Bear. A brilliant but appallingly rash researcher allows some of his intelligent, genetically engineered microbes to set up shop in his body. Dire consequences ensue for both him and the universe. More fascinating science from Bear, and a page-turning narrative to boot. A<br /><br />\\"Her Furry Face\\" by Leigh Kennedy.

Impossible to put down--simultaneously funny and frightening, this story is about a lovelorn 367-pound gourmand who signs up for a rather unique weight loss program. Results, to say the least, are mixed. Ingenious concept (with apologies to Oscar Wilde), witty, fast-paced narrative, perfectly constructed plot, unforgettably ghoulish images. Opposable thumbs up! A+<br />\\"Nearly Departed\\" by Pat Cadigan. Unremarkable fare about a mind prober probing a dead poet's memories. C<br />\\"Hearts Do Not in Eyes Shine\\" by John Kessel. Troubled turn-of-the twenty-first married couple attempts to rekindle their romance by torching their memories of each other. B<br /><br />\\"Carrion Comfort\\" by Dan Simmons. Like a Quentin Tarantino film: well crafted disgustingly graphic violence. Creepy cold-hearted senior citizens with psychic powers induce hapless nobodies to commit horrendous crimes--then turn on each other. I could find no redeemable qualities beneath the carnage.

Disaster closes in on the crippled remnants of the Spanish Armada in the frozen North Atlantic, as seen from the eyes of a spiritually sensitive youth dragooned into service.

On the surface, it is a common-sensical and simple set of instructions on how to properly order one's life with respect to God and man.  But underlying it is a complex theology that can probably be understood best by reading his other works as well.	2003-01-20

Merton goes through these same stages of spiritual awareness and development in language I found far easier to understand.<br />But \\"New Seeds\\" is not merely a reworking of \\"Dark Night\\". I can't judge the value of his insights as they would apply to a true contemplative, but I suspect he offers much. For a worldly person who seeks spiritual growth, there is no question of this book's value.<br />Merton's major theme is humility. Only through humility can we discover faith. Only through humility can we rid ourselves of the distractions that separate us from God. Materialism, pride, sensuality, and the like are so well accepted in our society that we seldom see on how deeply they disrupt our souls. Merton's uncompromising reflections are a cold slap in the face.<br />\\"New Seeds\\" is also a moving defense of mysticism. God cannot be found through reason alone. He cannot be understood by reading or thinking. In fact, He cannot be understood at all. The emptying that we must do, the shedding of our selfish skins, can only begin when we decide to relinquish our selves to His will. Again, in a materialistic society, such ideas seem absurd; Merton conveys them with a power that makes any other idea seem absurd, even to the most rational reader.<br />Finally...even though Merton cautions us against excessive emotion as a false measure of interior progress, he writes at times with majesty that cannot help but inspire: \\"As a magnifying glass concentrates the rays of the sun into a little burning ray of heat that can set fire to a dry leaf or a piece of paper, so the mystery of Christ in the Gospel concentrates the rays of God's light and fire to a point that sets fire to the spirit of man...Through the glass of His Incarntation He concentrates the rays of His Divine Truth and Love upon us so that we feel the burn, and all mystical experience is communicated to men through the Man Christ.\\"of Christ in the Gospel concentrates the rays of God's light and fire to a point that sets fire to the spirit of man...Through the glass of His Incarntation He concentrates the rays of His Divine Truth and Love upon us so that we feel the burn, and all mystical experience is communicated to men through the Man Christ.\\"	2002-12-26

As the series progresses, the questions get harder.  Volume Three covers Church dogma and morals in great detail.  In particular, the sixty year-old commentary on morals is eerily, sadly prophetic.  The consequences of a drift toward complete moral relativism are described as a nightmare scenario, yet how much of it has come to pass--steadily rising divorce, abortion, alienation, violence, division into smaller and smaller groups dedicated only to the advancement of some self-proclaimed social imperative.  Undoubtedly, to a non-believer, the prophetic quality of the arguments is the strongest point in their favor. It is not hard to see the moral quagmire we live in (if one only bothers to look), but to see it so clearly when it was just forming--that requires a true vision, a true perspective. For the believer, the truth of the Fathers' arguments is self-evident, for it is simply the Word of God.	2002-12-06

Louis puts forth compelling arguments on why you should fear hell, why you should repent, and why you should repent NOW.  The second part of the book offers advice to the repentant sinner--how to avoid the ever-present temptation to commit mortal and venial sins. One theme I enjoyed throughout the book was his depiction of God's dual nature: His outstretched arm and firm hand; His justice and His mercy. The repentant sinner will receive mercy, but for the unrepentant...  Fr. Louis uses extensive Biblical citations and quotes from the Church Doctors to support his arguments.  These references are always on point and frequently beautiful and moving.  So, besides providing instruction on how to better your character, the book will deepen your understanding of the Bible and the roots of Catholic theology.  Fr. Louis quotes St. Augustine extensively.  For me, his &quot;Confessions&quot; had a much greater impact, maybe because it was so personal and so human a story.  &quot;The Sinner's Guide&quot; is not a personal conversion story; it is more of an instruction manual. Good reading nonetheless!	2002-10-15

Sergeant Bourgogne was one of the very few French soldiers to survive the retreat from Moscow. The gruesome hardships he and his fellow soldiers endure is rendered even more horrible by the matter-of-fact style in which he relates them--as for instance when he describes in detail how they are forced to burn a bridge as their retreating comrades are still marching across it. Bourgogne's perspective is ground level: no tactics, no strategy, no grand designs.  All you feel is the stripped-down horror of war. And although Bourgogne remains altogether stoic and patriotic throughout his ordeal, as an urgent cry for peace, his diary ranks right up there with \\"The Red Badge of Courage\\", \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\", and \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\".  But Bourgogne's account is not fiction, and considering how few men were left to tell the tale, it is a miracle we have it at all.  It should be read and remembered.	2002-09-10

The writing is clear, concise, and relentlessly logical.  The arguments put forth are a remarkable combination of common sense, logic, and Scriptural reference.  Not only does the book give Protestants, agnostics, humanists, and atheists a lot to think about, it is a fantastic resource for Catholics who desire a full understanding of our religious beliefs and practices, top to bottom.  The big difference between Volumes 1 and 2 is that the latter responds to far more challenging questions, delving deeper into the same general topics covered in Volume 1.	2002-09-03

This is a later work of Merton's, and what comes across more than anything is his all too human moodiness.  At times he seems to despair of the human condition.  But then a tremendous hope wells up in him as he sees Christianity reaching out in brotherhood to all men of all faiths and non-faiths.  But regardless of his attitude, Merton, as always, maintains the highest standards for fidelity to one's self and to God.  His rather caustic critiques of Western culture seem more true today than when he wrote them in the 1960's, as he exposes the moral rationalizations and spiritual hollowness that necessarily accompany a mass culture devoted to materialism and pragmatism.  His understanding of the human condition is so clear and so true and so universal, that his writing seems to be speaking to each of us alone, much as a parent might speak to his child.  And like a child, our first reaction to his challenging words might be resentment or denial, but in the end, if we reflect and examine, we begin to see his truth-that is, his pointing us to God.  I imagine one of Merton's hopes in this book is to move us beyond words and arguments so we might dispense with temporal intellectual distractions and concentrate on what counts-personal salvation.	2002-08-16

I've been on Atkins for just two weeks and the results have been fantastic. I'm down 12 pounds, and feel much more fit. For me the most amazing thing has been the complete disappearance of food cravings. I used to come home from work and eat anything I could get my hands on. This would drive my wife crazy as she was preparing dinner, which I would proceed to wolf down and then start munching on crackers, chips, whatever: you name it, I'd eat it. This had been going on for years, and all the while, I thought I was doing myself a favor because I was maintaining a nice healthy low fat diet. I guess I overlooked the fact that in three years my weight had ballooned from 185 to almost 230! When a co-worker who'd been on the diet for six months with super results started telling me about it, I was intrigued. I did a fair amount of research and finally decided to pull the trigger. So far, so good. And, as nice as the weight loss has been, the emotional and psychological benefits are even better: no compulsive urges to eat, no more guilt because no more gorging. The diet has definitely had a calming effect. <br />It's obvious from the reviews Atkins affects people differently. But whether you try Atkins or not, I highly recommend the book because it will force you rethink your whole concept of nutrition. If you end up doing nothing more than cutting back on junk food, you'll be doing yourself a huge favor. (In fact, I can hardly imagine anyone reading this book and not thinking twice about the next can of pop, bag of potato chips, or jelly donut.) If you look at the evidence and decide to give the diet a try, there's every reason to think you'll be glad you did.<br />Update from 10-02...Been on pre-maintenance faithfully,weight down from 230 to 205 and dropping slowly but steadily.  Feel great.  More energy.  Just got a blood test: triglycerides down big and HDL's up, but overall cholesterol and LDL's up big.  I may have to modify my diet to bring the numbers down.	2002-07-25

I know of three major campaigns, all ending in disaster:  Charles XII of Sweden (against Peter the Great), Napoleon, and Hitler. Charles XII and Hitler were mediocre generals at best, but Napoleon--how could he blunder so grotesquely in strategy and tactics?  Riehn's book does an excellent job of explaining it.  The lack of maps, as the other reviewer noted, is definitely a problem in following the details of logistics and battles.  My paperback edition has one map, but it's lousy.  However, Riehn makes up for this with a strong narrative that makes the whole campaign come alive.<br />My father found a great book years ago--\\"Retreat from Moscow\\", by Bourgogne (?) long out of print. It's the memoirs of a French officer who miraculously survived the retreat.  If you can find it, read it!	2002-07-19
US	52772472	R2JLXP5AIHS9LR	089555089X	21992196	Radio Replies: Volume One	Books	5	18	18	N	Y	A Masterpiece of Catholic Apologetics	\\"Radio Replies\\" is considered a foundation text for Catholic apologetics.  The three volumes are transcripts of a 1930's radio program in which two priests, one from Australia and one from the United States, answer write-in questions inquiring about (or in many cases outright attacking) Catholic beliefs on just about every subject you can think of.<br />Volume One is fascinating both as a work of apologetics and as an historical document.  In terms of apologetics, Catholic positions are stated coherently, concisely, and consistently, with arguments appealing to reason as well as drawing heavily from Scripture.  The overriding message is that the Catholic Church is alone the true church established by Christ, and this assertion is backed up with arguments that can not be easily dismissed.<br />The stridency of tone in this book will sound peculiar to many readers today.  Historically, it is interesting to see how things have changed over the last seventy-odd years.  Frs. Rumble and Carty speak often of man's duty to himself, to fellow man, and the necessity to submit totally to the will of God.  Such talk is certainly not in vogue today.  In the strongest language, the priests assert the Catholic's profound responsibility to attend Mass every Sunday, to abstain from meat on Friday, to refuse participation in other religious services, etc.  Since Vatican II, many such strict guidelines have been loosened, and one wonders, when reading this, how beneficial that has been.  The priests abhor a world of moral relativism, and attribute its development in part to Protestantism, with its ever-increasing theological fragmentation, its substitution of man-made law for God's law, and the crisis in faith and morals that result.  (It is important to note the priests do not attack Protestants personally, their good will, or their good works; they object only to the underlying precepts of the movement itself.)  When one looks at the moral chaos in our society today, the words of caution and dire predictions of \\"Radio Replies\\" seem at times prophetic.<br />One weakness in this volume-the vast majority of questions (over 1500 in Volume One) are posed by lay people who obviously have little understanding of Catholicism and a highly prejudiced attitude toward Catholic people and practices.  The one- or two-line questions are basically softballs, which the priests easily hit clear out of the park.  So although \\"Radio Replies\\" contains an enormous amount of indispensable information, it does not take on many intellectually rigorous challenges.  That being said, \\"Radio Replies\\" provides incredibly clear insight on what the Catholic Church stands for, and why.caution and dire predictions of \\"Radio Replies\\" seem at times prophetic. <br />One weakness in this volume-the vast majority of questions (over 1500 in Volume One) are posed by lay people who obviously have little understanding of Catholicism and a highly prejudiced attitude toward Catholic people and practices.

Thomas chose to leave his embattled world for the monastery and devote his life to God.  Escapism?  Retreat?  Hardly.  Thomas shows us with great pain, passion, and eloquence how monastic life is the ultimate battle, that between the spirit and the flesh, with stakes no less than one's eternal salvation.  \\"Imitations\\" teaches us how to be humble before God and each other, and how to live in a manner pleasing to God.  It offers up devotional prayers that help us move toward a real and meaningful relationship with Jesus.  And in Book Four, it provides profound reflections on the Eucharist that, for Catholics, take this Sacrament to a whole new level of significance, mystery, and beauty.<br />In many ways the book is not comforting, for it offers no easy answers.  Instead, it challenges us to look at our thoughts and actions with utmost clarity and honesty.  This is neither easy nor comfortable, but in the end, our only road to peace.  Thomas's writing has certainly stood the test of time.  After over five hundred years, his words still ring true, and loudly.	2002-06-27

Keating writes with great clarity.  He zeroes in on the true differences between Catholic and fundamentalist beliefs, as well as draw attention to the misconceptions on both sides that lead to unproductive debate. While at every opportunity he conveys distaste for the irrationality of fundamentalist positions, he derides Catholics with equal vigor for their lack of Scriptural knowledge and foggy understanding of their own beliefs.  In the first few chapters, Keating takes a look at key fundamentalist beliefs, movements and leaders, picking them apart piece by piece until there isn't much of anything left.  In the ensuing chapters he shifts the focus to specific Catholic doctrines and issues, such as the Papacy and the Inquisition, pointing out why fundamentalist conceptions are usually far afield from the truth.  When all is said and done, one has a greater appreciation of how rational and truth-seeking Catholicism is. Yet these very qualities often make it difficult for the layman to articulate a defense against fundamentalist charges: it isn't easy to boil down two thousand years of doctrinal thought and understanding into a few pithy phrases.  A proper defense of Catholicism requires patience, method, learning, charity, and unrelenting intellectual honestly. Keating's approach contains all these elements, and therefore makes for an excellent guide to explaining and understanding the faith.	2002-06-11

Contemplation is the practice of seeking clarity--a clear vision of who we are, a clear vision of our relationship to God. So, with honest, relentless precision, Merton exposes our false postures of ego, pride, attachement, fear--those unholy but seductive impulses that cloud our souls and separate us from God. It is obvious that \\"Contemplative Prayer\\" is the product of an experienced contemplative, one who has experienced and reflected upon a lifetime of struggle, enough so that he can boil down the essence of spiritual survival into a handful of simple words. But he does much more than that: after shattering each underpinning of our personal complacency, he draws back and puts his observations in their monastic and theological context, giving us a fuller, deeper understanding of the religious tradition we belong to. For example, at one point, Merton elegantly and brilliantly summarizes \\"Dark Night of the Soul\\" (St. John of the Cross) in a way that makes it fully relevant to the modern reader. As a bonus, this edition contains an introduction by the distinguished Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh (who in some respects is himself a Buddhist version of Thomas Merton). Hahn explores and compares the spiritual struggles of Buddhism and Christianity with respect to prayer, meditation, practice, and God--on those crucial levels we see that ultimately we have one nature, despite the obvious and superficial differences that tend to separate us. On a literary note, \\"Contemplative Prayer\\" will be particularly interesting to those drawn to existentialism or seeking a deeper understanding of it. At first glance, one might think no two people could be further apart than Camus' Stranger and the Christian contemplative, but they are in fact quite alike. Both have heightened awareness of their true nature. Both acknowledge the meaninglessness of the world formerly thought of as \\"real\\". Both have learned that contemplation of the real comes at a heavy price, yet one that is unavoidable to the soul honestly seeking truth.

This plainly written book can help you overcome the daily struggles that prevent you from developing a strong relationship with God.<br />First the author identifies the eight objects of self-centered thought we must learn to control: food, sex, things, anger, dejection, acedia (spiritual dryness), vainglory, and pride. She then describes how these thoughts, when uncontrolled, progressively undermine our spiritual awareness to the point of becoming soul-deadening obsessions. Finally, she explains how we can overcome these distracting thoughts and instead center on thoughts in harmony with God's will. By doing so, we are able to experience the joys of hope and freedom, no longer enslaved by our appetites.<br />Funk does an excellent job of translating some complex spiritual concepts into plain English. And, to illustrate good and bad thought patterns, she cites examples that will sound (uncomfortably) familiar to people of all ages and vocations. It's hard to imagine people reading this book and not wanting to seriously reevaluate their attitudes toward toward their own thoughts.	2002-05-13

First and foremost, Harrington excels at putting Matthew in its historical context. By tracing changes within the Jewish community from Old Testament times through circa 70AD, he clearly shows how this Gospel was intended to solidify Christian identity and Scriptural validity after the destruction of the temple, when competing theologies were battling for the hearts and minds of the Jewish people. His extensive translation notes are also helpful, as they explain nuances of meaning that would go unnoticed by a lay reader using a thinly-annotated text.<br />Two other themes of this commentary stand out. First, Harrington takes great pains to demonstrate that Matthew is not an indictment of the Jewish race and has been totally misinterpreted by some as a call to anti-Semitism--an important message in any age.  Second, he continually compares Matthew to Mark, pointing out virtually all similarities and differences.  While this is interesting (and indirectly useful in understanding Mark), I'm not sure how important these distinctions are in terms of grasping the historical and theological significance of Matthew.  On the other hand, presenting Matthew and Mark in this way does highlight the uniqueness of each Gospel--no doubt a worthy end in itself.	2002-04-30

Amazon steered me to this book when I was looking for more on Cuban politics after reading \\"Against All Hope\\" by Armando Valladares (a maginificent, poetic book about the horrors of life in the Cuban gulag).<br />Geyer presents a sweeping biography of Castro, from childhood all the way up to September 11. She offers real insight on Castro's psychology and crisply recounts events leading up the revolution. It is primarily a political history.<br />To me the most fascinating aspect of Castro's story is how easily he comes to power after starting out with such pathetically meager resources. His \\"liberation\\" of Cuba begins with a tragi-comic marine landing by a handful of hungry and confused rebels. Incredibly, by virtue of his irresistible personality, brilliant, bold, and ruthless tactics, and a hopelessly incompetent Batista regime, Castro takes control of Cuba. The story is remarkably similar to that of Pizarro's conquest of the Incas.<br />Two problems with the book. First, I think Geyer's narrative becomes quite sketchy after Castro reaches power. There's a lot going on, and she needs more detail to tie together all the political, psychological, and social threads of her story. Second, the writing is uneven: her descriptions of characters and events are passionate and dramatic, but her analysis is sometimes vague and hard to follow.<br />All in all, Geyer paints a pretty good picture of the Castro phenomenon. If you have never delved into this subject, you might be astonished at what's been going on 90 miles from the United States. Clearly, Geyer knows her material, since she personally knows many, many of the key political figures in Cuba and the United States. I think she is a very reliable source of information on a subject where reliable reporting is hard to find.	2002-03-25

For help, I turned to the Catechism, which proved to be a concise, well written, logically organized, and often inspirational teacher.  The Catechism not only provides clear definitions of Church rites and beliefs, it explains how those definitions came about and evolved, and how they are firmly rooted in Divine Revelation.  For many years I had great misconceptions about the Church, I guess primarily because I viewed Church practices and beliefs as something man-made, not God-made.  After doing some investigation and study, I discovered how wrong my view had been. Reading the Catechism will deepen your understanding of the relationship between the Church and Scriptures, and the &quot;whys&quot; behind the &quot;whats&quot; of how we practice our faith.	2002-02-28

Imprisoned on trumped up charges by the brutal and paranoid Castro regime, he spent twenty-two years in the Cuban gulag, suffering unspeakable physical and psychological torture. Despite the inhuman deprivations inflicted upon him and his fellow political prisoners, he refused to buckle under to his sadistic captors. Through his unshakeable faith in God and an iron will, he resisted to the last; in the end, he gained freedom for himself and his family, dealt a heavy political blow to the Castro regime, and helped save other prisoners from a worse fate by bringing world attention to the horrible inhumanity of the Cuban prison system.<br />One could say it is like \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" with a happy ending, except that thousands of political prisoners, guilty of nothing more than the desire for freedom, continue to languish in Cuban prisons. It is questionable whether they are better off than the thousands more who have been executed, starved to death, beaten to death, or slowly exterminated by the ravages of illness. Valladares gives us far more than an impassioned narrative with characters of unbelievable courage and others of unbelievable cruelty. He gives us an irresistible call to action: wherever and however freedom is attacked, we must resist. No matter how hopeless it seems, the strength of a single person can be more powerful than the tanks and guns of an entire army.	2002-02-28
US	52772472	R4WKBUMIQEWPJ	0156010860	734553685	The Seven Storey Mountain	Books	5	8	8	N	Y	An Inspiring Journey of Faith	This famous autobiography chronicles the author's life from childhood up to the point as a young man he makes the bold decision to enter the Trappist order.  Like many of us, Merton spiritually sleepwalks through much of his youth.  But gradually, he is drawn to God as he comes to perceive the shallowness and futility of the intellectuality and self-indulgence that had thusfar characterized his life. Eventually his love for God becomes a passion of awesome proportions, enabling him to bring his life into a wonderous balance, inspiring him to write some of the most influential religious reflections of our age or perhaps any age.<br />The questions Merton grapples with here--how to balance the seemingly conflicting impulses of our intellect, passions, and spirit--are timeless.  Anyone looking for greater harmony in his/her life will undoubtedly find great insight and inspiration from Merton's story.<br />Also--I think today \\"The Seven Storey Mountain\\" is particularly relevant because of its historical context, which so closely parallels our own.  Much of Merton's story takes place during the outbreak of World War II.  As war looms larger and larger, Merton describes with great unease the sense of impending doom, the uncertainty of where the world is heading, and yet the certainty it is heading somewhere disturbing and dangerous. As I read Merton's reflections on the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia--a defining act of war--for a moment I thought I was reading about September 11. The looming threat of terrorism gives us a newfound ability to relate to Merton's world, and this I think makes his message far more accessible, meaningful, and necessary for us to hear.	2002-02-27

As always, Dozois includes a wide range of styles and themes, from the lyrical to the hardest of hard science. So...while there's always something for everybody, you can't expect to enjoy every story. My favorites:<br />Good:<br />\\"Going After Bobo\\"--Heartwrenching, poetic character study, but the plot is pretty thin.<br />\\"Crux\\"--Dark detective story/social commentary set in a brutal post-holocaust future dominated by the Orient. Quite violent, with a fast paced and tighty knit plot.<br />\\"The Raggle Taggle Gypsy-O\\"--Time travel with two amazing characters. Provocative, in-your-face prose.<br />\\"Radiant Green Star\\"--Another violent future world dominated by the Orient. This time it's a traditional mystery combined with a poetic coming-of-age story.<br />\\"Great Wall of Mars\\"--A cult of humans with networked implants battle unnetworked humans for survival. Lots of action, great speculation on the potential of the human mind.<br />\\"A Colder War\\"--Alternate Cold War history with aliens causing major problems for both sides. Confusing plot, but highly realistic narrative keeps it interesting anyway.<br />Great:<br />\\"The Suspect Genome\\"--Future world whodunit, set in an England where police work has been somewhat privatized. Brilliant plot construction and writing keep you engaged all the way.<br />\\"On the Orion Line\\"--Man versus powerful and inscrutable aliens deep in space, far in the future. Well developed characters, fast paced and straightforward plot.<br />\\"Obsidian Harvest\\"--Another future world detective story set in England. What makes this one extraordinary is the premise, where the Aztecs dominate the world--human sacrifices, feathered capes, lots of tequila. Add hard-boiled prose in the tradition of Dashiell Hammett (his \\"Red Harvest\\" is great) and you have something unforgettable.<br />\\"Patient Zero\\"--Nightmarish account of a dreadful near-future. Great plot, great characters, and makes some strong statements in only fifteen pages.ents in only fifteen pages.	2002-02-27

In plain language that's very easy to follow, Merton describes how we can abandon our self-absorbed lives and then discover again our true selves in Jesus Christ. It is a book about the transforming power of God, and although it is deeply spiritual in tone and theme, it is highly logical and straightforward in style and structure. Merton hopes to lead us to transformation and salvation not through fear or blind hope, but by persuasion.	2001-08-26

Gradually, he loses enthusiasm for his work, finds his sensual pursuits less and less fulfilling, and realizes his life has no purpose.  His search for meaning and direction becomes agonizing and desparate.  His mind and soul are in torment: he increasingly sees his answers lying in the direction of God, but he fights against faith with all his might, unable to give up the sensual indulgences he clings to so tightly, if only out of habit.  Augustine describes his struggle vividly, passionately, and with utter honesty. When he finally breaks through and embraces God with the whole of his being, he discovers in himself a strength and focus so powerful he changes the world forever. Yet Augustine is in many respects an average person, full of flaws and inconsistencies.  And clearly, he worked hard to find his faith, suffering many setbacks along the way. These things make Augustine seem all the more human, and his story all the easier to understand.  The second part of the book is less personal, mainly a reflection on key passages of Genesis.  The writing becomes more theoretical, and somewhat difficult to understand without a strong grasp of the Scriptures.  (It would be helpful to read or reread Psalms before tackling &quot;Confessions&quot;--it's Augustine's favorite book of the Bible and he quotes it extensively throughout the work.)	2001-06-19

Not only does Johnson artfully outline and explain complex Church practices, he provides many historical asides that are enlightening and just--fun. For example, when discussing the colors of vestments, he goes into fascinating detail on the development of purple as the color associated with imperial power in the Roman empire and why the Church adopted the practice. The book is highly readable and well organized.  Some reviewers have noted the book's decidedly pro-Roman Catholic slant, but passages that might bother some readers don't crop up that often and needn't deter you if you're interested in this subject.	2001-03-12

Arthur Schnitzler is today a fairly obscure Austrian novelist and playwright of the early 1900's. He's received some attention recently because his novella \\"Dream Story\\" inspired Kubrick's \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\". (\\"Dream Story\\" is also excellent and can help you understand the movie.) \\"Casanova's Homecoming\\", if you can find a copy, is well worth reading--compact, simply told, carefully plotted, thoroughly thought-provoking. It relates a fictitious episode in Casanova's life when he has become an old man of 53. Most of his charm and all of his money are gone, but his cravings and amorality remain. Quite by chance, he comes to visit the home of an old acquaintance who is much indebted to him, and immediately sets out upon a dark seduction. It is a story about growing old, about how one's struggle to remain young can become pathetic and ugly even when it succeeds. Schnitzler likes to write about sex, dreams, coincidence, free-thinking, and deep mysteries of the soul--\\"Casanova's Homecoming\\" gets you thinking about all these themes, mainly because it's very hard to ascertain Schnitzler's attitude toward Casanova--does he like him? Loathe him? Pity him? Does he have any feeling toward him at all? After reading this, you may find yourself asking many such questions. This may have been the author's intent: his writing seems designed to provoke questions rather than provide answers. He does it well!	2000-10-11

For years I had wanted to read this, and when I finally got around to it, I was a little disappointed.  On the positive side, Kantor creates characters who come alive and touch your heart.  His attention to detail makes it possible to visualize seemingly every square inch of the camp, and many scenes depicting the horrors within are so emotionally powerful it becomes difficult to continue reading.  However, the mountains of detail often become oppressive and interfere with the flow of the story.  And because I found the writing rather awkward, I frequently had to reread sentences and entire paragraphs in order to fully grasp the meaning. The book is remarkable, but with some serious editing, it could have been a masterpiece.	2000-09-29

You can read this very quickly, but it's so captivating you'll wish there were more.  Marquez makes you feel the sailor's hunger, his thirst, his lonliness, his fear, and his hope.  It's an ideal book to give a young reader--twelve to fourteen years old, perhaps--to get him/her interested in &quot;adult&quot; reading: the narrative is quite simple, but the story is as exciting as any you'll find, and one you'll remember for a long time.	2000-09-28

This book is fascinating for both its historical and spiritual insight.  While reading it, I was reminded of the New Testament:  it records the personalities and struggles of the Buddha's disciples; it lays out the fundamentals of the Buddha's teachings, mainly by recording his conversations and deeds; it puts Buddhism in an historical context by describing how it developed and attracted followers; it goes far beyond history by describing how the Buddha touches us profoundly by helping us discover what is beautiful within us.  As always, Thich Nhat Hanh's writing is simple, clear, straightforward-- yet magically inspiring.  It's a wonderful book for anyone interested in the facts of Buddhism and the essence of its teachings.	2000-09-27

The idea of truly living moment by moment, of making the most of each moment, has powerfully influenced my attitude and feelings about many things. Here is a great place for a Western reader  to begin learning about Buddhist philosophy.  The writing is clear and  beautiful.  The ideas, though expressed simply, contain great subtlety and  meaning.  And the examples used to illustrate these ideas, such as red  lights and ringing phones, come from our everyday experiences. If your life  seems to be somehow out of control, if your spirit is struggling for peace,  you may, as I did, find real help in these pages.  But I think this is a  book that must be lived, not merely read--it is not an answer, but the  beginning of an answer.	2000-07-13

The first section, covering Adolfus's campaign  in the Thirty Year's War, was quite entertaining, mainly because his  efforts were dramatic, innovative, and successful against overwhelming  odds. However, once into the military exploits of Conde, Turenne, Cromwell,  Eugene, and Marlborough, the narrative becomes rather monotonous,  describing one siege after another, one uneventful campaigning season after  another.  (This, too, no doubt reflects the time: the whole period of the  post-Adolfus Thirty Year's War and the War of the Spanish Succession was  one vast war of attrition.)  Dodge does describe the important battles  quite well, and offers incisive assessments of the character and abilities  of the period's leading military figures.  The book is long (about 850  pages), and long on military facts and figures.  Dodge, a veteran of the  American Civil War, writes in a rather formal and technical style, adding  to the difficulties in wading through the text. I would give the book an  &quot;A&quot; for information, but a &quot;C-&quot; for readability.  If  the subject matter really interests you, I'd  say give it a try.  If not,  pass.	2000-05-30

The chapters covering Peter's tour of Europe and the war against Sweden contain a tremendous amount of detail, but the writing is never  tedious.  Besides telling you just about everything you'd want to know  about Peter the Great, Massie gives a very poignant account of Charles XII  of Sweden.

Although the author describes the political and military events of Ivan's reign in fine style, his gruesome descriptions of Ivan's brutality and distrubing probes into his psychology are the strength of this book.  You will feel nothing but pity for all who face Ivan's wrath, and that includes everyone from the lowliest peasants to the ruling classes to his own son.  In addition to exploring all facets of the first Czar's twisted psyche, Troyat also spends a plenty of time on his crude manners, limited intellect, and ineffectual strategies.  Still, Troyat's account has enough balance to make you feel at least a twinge of sympathy for Ivan, and more than a twinge of respect for his accomplishements in forging a kingdom out of the barbarous and disordered world he was born into.	2000-04-11

Prescott's artistic style, meticulous attention to detail, and brilliantly structured narrative bring out all the drama and excitement.  Unlike many histories, this work has nothing about it that is tedious or dry--particularly remarkable since Prescott never visited South America and developed his sweeping account exclusively from literary sources. The author's ability to reconstruct the attitudes and motivations of the key characters gives the reader a much deeper understanding of the events. Before reading the book, I knew next to nothing about the Incas or the settlement of the region.  Upon finishing it, I felt as though I'd received a thorough (and most enjoyable) schooling.	1999-10-08
