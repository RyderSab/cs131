And though we didn't try and &quot;fish in the air&quot;, he  did spend a lot of time telling me of his home town in Italy and how he  learned how to fish.  This book brings it all out again, in gorgeous  illustrations and  and powerful verse.   <br />It doesn't matter if you have  never fished in your life.  Get this book for your father.	2000-09-13

I liked this retelling of a classic -- especially in the slight twist - yes, the ants have foresight but they are workaholics and the grasshopper  may not be industrious but  he appreciats the beauty of a summer night.   But it's the elegant illustrations that really catch my eye and highlight  this story.   Delicate ink strokes with sharp details on rice paper capture  the spirit of chinese art and are a wonderful complement to the story's  setting.  Simply gorgeous and a treat for the eyes.  It makes me believe  that Aesop should have done this himself!	2000-09-12

Now he's back, with a new challenge to face: his  estranged father, Carter.  Carter is just as wired as Joey once was -- but  Carter believes that Joey can kick his ADD cold turkey, and flushes his  meds down the toilet.  Joey wants to believe, and to trust his dad, but  what happens when father doesn't always know best?<br />This sequel focuses  more on Joey's relationship with his family.   He struggles to walk the  line between wanting to please his father, but also do what is right for  him.  Though not as arresting as the previous book, we still get to see the  world through Joey's eyes and a bit heartbreaking for the reader to watch  him lose his hard won self control.  I'd reccomend it to anyone who had to  struggle either with ADD or with family issues.	2000-09-12

And maybe if this book had been around when I was a kid, my parents would have had an easier time.  Lola  has a long list of foods she won't eat but some creative thinking from her  older sister changes all that.<br />The idea is great but it is the colorful  illustrations that I love.   The figures are cut outs that are placed  ingeniously on all kinds of bacgrounds, lending texture and vibrance to the  story.   I'm definately giving this book to all the fussy eaters I know.

And I spent a good deal of my childhood watching kids shoot up like weeds  and wondering when it would happen to me.   This is why I can relate so  much to Alex.  He's short too and tries everything he can think of to grow  taller.  But it takes advice from his very tall Uncle Danny to make him see  that it's not what you have but what you do with it that makes a  difference.  A great story and not just for short people.	2000-09-12

What's a girl to do when she wakes up with antlers on her head?<br />I remember this book from way back when!  It had such a magical, whimsical  quality that stayed with me for a long time.  The story is told simply with  wry humor and the illustrations are crips and clean.  It's so good to see  it back in print for a whole new generation to discover.   I've already  introduced it to my friend's child who now wants to wear antlers for  halloween.   If you never read this as a kid, then run out and read it now.   You won't regret it.	2000-09-12

So she struggles with with adapting to her  new &quot;bird&quot; lifestyle, while trying to be true to her bat  heritage.  <br />Luminous illustrations complement this sweet story that  interweaves animal facts with a fable.

It's a celebration of kid-hood (vs baby-dom), about a girl who looks back on her childhood from the grand old age of four  and a half years and marvels at all the things she can do now.  Like braid  her hair, go to school, eat pizza and paint your toes (bubblegum)  pink.<br />It's infectious and a real treat!

In  &quot;Stellaluna&quot;  she made us identify with a lost bat; in  &quot;Verdi&quot; she made us cheer for a snake who learns to shed his  skin; but now she tackles the impossible:  cockroaches!<br />Crickwing (so  named because of a twisted wing) is a lonely cockroach.  He spends his days  as a &quot;food-stylist&quot;, crafting sculptures of his food before  eating them. But he and his sculptures are easy prey to lizards and other  roach-eating critters.  <br />Tired of being a victem, he decides he is going  to pick on some smaller targets:  ants!  But the leaf-eating ants are not  as harmless as they seem and they swarm Crickwing when his shenanigans go  too far.  Crickwing is not really the bully he seems, and when danger  threatens both the ants and him, he becomes an unlikely hero!    Vibrant  and just as engaging as her previous books,  though this one is more of a  cheeky fable then fantasy.  &quot;Crickwing&quot; just might make you think  twice before stepping on a cockroach!  A terrific companion piece for the  award-winning author.	2000-09-11

My friend's 4 year old daughter asked me to read her this book (her favorate) for bedtime, and once I started, I got hooked.  Verdi is a young  python, proud of his adventurous lifestyle and his bold yellow coloring.   He can't understand the older snakes who have shed their yellow skin for  deep emerald green and now spend their days snoozing in the trees.  He  nevers wants to grow up to be like them!  When he notices that (tragedy!)  he is starting to turn green (a sign that his body is getting older) he  performs one daredevil stunt after another until he is forced to slow down  and learn to take it easy.<br />Anyone who never wanted to grow  &quot;Old&quot; can appreciate this tale.  But just because you have to  grow up doesn't mean you you have to be &quot;old.&quot;  As in her  previous book, &quot;Stellaluna&quot; the author mixes animal facts with  fantasy. This is a book not only lovely to read, but a treat for the eyes!   Lush illustrations capture the greens and jewel colors of the rainforest.	2000-09-11

You read along as Stanley rates the pros and cons of tiger  life (ex:  they are more exciting than cats, but they'd need MORE than just  canned food...)<br />As in SHARK-MAD STANLEY, Griff  (aka Andrew Griffin)  combines a whimsical story with real animal facts (did you know that tigers  don't purr...?)  The computer generated illustrations are marvelous.  But  best of all for my money, it comes with an interactive CD-ROM takes readers  into Stanley's world, complete with games, tiger facts, a screen saver, and  Stanley's notebook to name just a few.  A wonderful series, especialy for  young animal lovers.	2000-08-16

Memorable vocal contributions by Jimmy Durante  (whose unique song-stylings turn his rendition of the Frosty song into the  stuff of legend), Billy De Wolfe (tricky, tricky, tricky, Professor  Hinkle), and the unforgettable Jackie Vernon  as the bellywhopping  magical man of snow, Frosty.<br />Now there's only one reason why I'm unhappy  with this release: NO extras on the DVD.  There is a trend in studios  nowadays to release as many titles as they can on DVD to see how well they  do, then re-release a new version with cool extras and features much later.

Only that is was well worth the wait!  For all of you who have never read any of the Potter books (could there really be people who haven't read at least one?) think  of these books as a series of magical mysteries.<br />It's life as usual for  Harry at the beginning of the book, which has him spending yet another  dreadful summer with his hateful guardians, the Dursleys.  (Imagine Dudley  Dursley on a diet!  Try saying that 3 times fast...)  Things pick up when  Harry goes to the Quiddich World Cup with the Weasleys.  And life at  Hogwarts is as interesting (and occasionally dangerous) as always with it's  oddball assortment of students and professors.  Naturally, there is a new  Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher (my but they do keep going through  them, don't they?)  Along the way, we will learn about other schools like  Hogwarts (it's about time!)  And a new villain - or should I say  villainess - is introduced. Someone who definately keeps Harry on his toes.  All the while Harry and his 2 best friends, Ron and Hermione, become  entangled with the mystery of The Goblet of Fire....<br />With characteristic  abandon, Rowling creates familiar  busy backdrop for Harry and friends as  she pushes him through a series of terrifying encounters, the usual  mischief and mayhem, new revelations (and, of course, rousing games of  Quidditch)<br />It's delightful to see how Rowling can stay true to the feel  of the previous books, and yet allow Harry and friends to mature (ex: As  the kids are officially teenagers now, hormones will kick in for Harry, Ron  and Hermione... but they all fall in love with the wrong people!  Harry  especially has some difficulties in this area.)<br />Be prepared: this is a  darker book than the first 3.  Some well known characters die -- one of  whom is well liked by readers.  The ending of the book is frightening  compaired to the previos books but is a necessary evil for Harry as the  older he gets, the more he learns about his past.  JK Rowling has stated  that each new book gets progressively darker so as to  tie in with the  overall plot.<br />As always she writes with a deft touch.  This deliciously  suspenseful novel is every bit as gripping and imaginative as the previous  books -- full of unexpected twists and turns.  A delight to be savored,  especially you are, like me, already awaiting the next one.older he gets, the more he learns about his past.

Her only mode of expression is in her  piano lessons (which she must now practice at school).  Through these  practice sessions she eventually becomes friends with the kindly janitor  who helps her come to grips with her struggles and her pain.<br />This is a  thoughtful story exploring the ache and confusion that divorce brings.   Eileen's bewilderment and inner rage is believable but even with that, the  story is lacking something.  Still it's a good novel to give to a child  going through a parent's divorce.	2000-06-29

Everyone believes she's a witch, or at least someone who's &quot;a bit touched in the head&quot; and steers clear  of her.   With a pirate patch on one eye, Maggie lives in a shabby caravan  with no electricity or plumbing along with her six dogs, six cats, and  other miscellaneous critters, it's no wonder she scares people off -- that  is, until a new family moves into town....<br />This is a funny sweet little  book reminding us that not everyone is as they appear on the outside.   Maggie lives the way she does because she wants to, not cause she has  to...and even after she makes friends with her new neighbors, she remains  her quirky wonderful self.  I  hope you come to love getting to know the  surprising Miss Slade as much as I did.	2000-06-29

Calling it an irreverent variation on fairy tales doesn't do the book justice.  <br />The narrator, Jack, mocks, spoofs, scoffs and heckles his way through these fractured fairy tales with no  apologies.  Everything is a goof from the crumbling title page, to the  wacky fonts, the take-no-prisoners illustrations and finally the wildly  eccentric stories.  <br />This is definately a read out loud book and not just  to your kids!  Read it when you need a serious dose of laugh out loud  demented silliness.<br />This is a visually comic masterpiece for everyone!	2000-06-29

With their father helping his brother miles away, they know they must survive alone.  They hide from  their neighbors (who talk of sending them to the orphan train) and try and  keep their spirits alive while they figure out what to do.<br />The setting is  bleak and harsh, but Ms Arrington shows us the beauty of the prairie  through Polly's unwavering eyes.  Don't expect this book to be another  Little House on the Prairie....this is a realistic and sometimes raw look  into the lives of two young sisters striving to keep their world intact.   The characters are always believable with no stereotypes and Polly in  particular stands out as strong and down to earth.  My only sour point with  this book is the ending which seems a bit abrupt compared with the rest of  the story.   Still it is good first novel that will linger in the mind.	2000-06-29

Though fairly predictable, I really liked the intermingling of  fantasy and reality of her latest book, LONG, LEAN and LETHAL.  Set in the  world daytime soaps, the fantasy of the show begins to entwine with the  mundane (and sometimes deadly) world of reality.  I immediately fell in  love with the concept - not to mention the leading man.  And I also enjoyed  the strength and attitude of the heroine.   Witty, charming and full of  dramatic energy, it's a great escape book - watch it when you are in need  for your &quot;soap fix&quot; for the day.	2000-06-13

But strangely, the only one I enjoyed (and that remained in my  memory) was the contribution from the popular Anne Barbour.  Her characters  were charming and was a very enjoyable read.  Other than that I have  trouble picking out any one story that stands out in my memory.  They all  ran together in a blur for me without any notable distinguishing features.   I guess I didn't enjoy it very much as a whole, preferring to settle on one  story I can sink my teeth into.	2000-06-13

Personal favorates include   &quot;Pig Brains,&quot; by  Alden Carter  about a boy using unusual methods  to get rid of a bully (funny and gross),  and &quot;Fine?&quot; by Margaret  Peterson Haddix, about a girl reasessing her life while waiting in the  hospital for a diagnosis of her terminal illness (touching and brave).   <br />Many of the authors are new to me, but after reading their contributions  I find myself wanting to check out their other works.  This is a good book  if you are looking to delve into the psychology of young adults today and  discover some of the everyday - and sometimes not so everyday - hardships  their endure.  Overall an interesting read.	2000-06-08

He, his mother and sister Tasha have left the projects and onto a better way of life.  But the change is not as happy as he first expects it to be.  His  close family seems to be going their own way and he fears that they are  drifting apart.  Tasha makes friends easily, while Junebug is tormented by  bullies (worse his mother insists he play soccar with them!).  His mother  finds a new romance which is hard for him to cope with, and as if that  wasn't enough, Junebug must now spend some time everday walking with a  cranky elderly  &quot;Reverand&quot; as part of his new responsibilites.  His hopes of having a lazy summer squashed, Junebug tries to adjust to his  new surroundings.  In the process he learns a great deal about family ties,  and himself.<br />This book is a sequel to JUNEBUG but you needn't have read  the first to enjoy JUNEBUG AND THE REVERAND.  I immediately liked the sweet  character of Junebug the moment he appears on the page...probably because I  know a kid just like him and I so seldom see such boys portrayed as  realistically in print.  He is thoughtful, kindhearted and resilient -- you  can't help but take him into your heart.  It is refreshing to see such an  honest portrayel of children and community and I look forward to reading  more about Junebug's growing up years.  This is a book to be shared with  your children.	2000-06-08

He's caught up with the ambition to write a novel before he begins highschool but had no idea how difficult it would be.  His friends are no help as they are caught up with their own summer obsessions:  his  best freind Mallory, a theme park fanatic, is trying to win a contest so  she can go to the Kingdom of Magic, Nick is too busy checking out girls,  and Gary is too busy idolizing Nick (when he's not trying to perfect his  english accent).  Things get even more complicated (and fun)  when almost  everyone gets involved with new romances.  So how is Jackie ever going to  finish -- much less start -- his novel?<br />This is a funny, sometimes  realistic, sometimes wacky book about the changes that take place between  grade school and highschool.  I enjoyed the reliving some of my own  escapades and confusions of tis time of life.   Jackie Monterey and his  friends are a hoot.  This is a delightful book perfect for some light  over-the-summer reading...and it may even inspire a novel or two from your  own kids.	2000-06-08

Will these chicks ever  escape the evil farm with their feathers still intact?<br />The book is a  simple retelling of the irreverent film and is easy reading for the younger  set.  It's sweet, gloriously silly and a wonderful companion to the film.   I especially enjoyed the  claymation pictures which do a wonderful job of  capturing the moment with just one glance.  I'd read it to you kids at  bedtime.<br />One side effect though -- don't be surprised if your kids refuse  to eat poultry after reading this book!	2000-06-08

His parents seem  normal and do all the expected contributions for their community.  Of course, normal for this community  consists of  bible study, wilderness survival training, and  weekend war  games to name just a few.  They are members of the Soldiers of God and this  is everyday life for Walker's family -- at least in public.  In private,  Walker's parents behave differently.  They read books for one thing, and  speak and act differently then other other parents do.  And why are there  no scrapbooks or family photos lying around?<br />This is an oddly interesting  book.  The strange community and the disturbing normalness of Walker make  for an odd combination.  But it is when Walker discovers the truth about  his family that things start getting interesting.  <br />The basic plot is a  bit too much like a movie of the week concept, but I did enjoy the the  characterizations and the Ms Gilbert's writing style.  And the Walker is a  character that stays with you even after you put down the book.	2000-06-08

Or is it only in his mind? <br />I wanted to like this book, but overall  the plot was just too implausible for me. The book moves back and forth in  time and since the story begins with Luke's death, we already know how the  book ends.   All in all, I found it difficult to get myself involved in  Luke's world and it's mostly unsympathetic characters.	2000-06-08

Peter Lerangis presents an exciting and sometimes horrifing novel about a 1909 expedition to the Antarctic.  The book centers on Jack Winslow, who,  not long after the death of his wife, takes his son and step son to the  bottom of the earth.  Also on the ship is a mismatched crew with their own  reasons for travel.  The book documents all the trials and dangers that  follow:  disharmony amoung the crew, freezing temperatures, ice floes,  and  sea creatures just to name a few.  <br />Though the story is dramatic, it is  hard to follow as each chapter is told from a different characters point of  view.  The book is also said to be told for ages 9-12 but I wonder if such  a dark story will appeal to the younger set.  I found the book interesting  and even exciting at times but ultimately it failed to keep my attention  and I found myself skimming through pages from time to time.  I won't ruin  the ending by sending that is was a little disappointing.  I don't know if  I can fully reccomend this story for children unless they have a true  hankering for period adventure pieces.	2000-06-08

Quinny is likeable and means well and you just can't help getting involved  in her antics.

This is a marriage of clever wordplay and uniquely silly illustrations by William Wise and Lynn Munsinger.  The dinosaur poetry is not only fun but informative as it combines imaginative  verse with dinosaur facts:  What do dinosaurs eat? How did they get along  with other dinosaurs?  And why could a T-Rex  never have been pink.   I  loved the poems for their keen humor and downright  silliness.  The  illustrations were a special treat (I still giggle at the picture of a very  frightened gorgosaurus exposing his massive teeth in the dentist's  chair!)<br />Creative and inventive - and great way for children to remember  which dinosaur is which!  (Or is that a problem only adults have...?  Never  fear...there's a helpful pronunciation guide included.)  If you liked such  poetry classics as Shel Silverstein's WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS, you will  delight in DINOSAURS FOREVER.	2000-06-08

The Werewolf Club : The Magic Pretzel, is a silly, absurd book but in the most delightful way.  <br />You see, Mr. Talbot,  half-man, half-wolf, and sponsor of the Watson Elementary  School Werewolf Club needs the one thing that can keep you from turning  into a werewolf:  The Magic Pretzel.  Unfortunately, it is under the care  of Talbot's half brother, Lance Von Sweeny, who keeps it locked away.     Enter Norman Gnormal, the only nonwerewolf in the club, who was raised as a  dog by his quirky parents (who actually wanted a dog instead of a little  boy).  Norman uses his tracking skills and canine-like smell to help Talbot  find the magic pretzel, but of course it ain't easy.<br />This is the first  book in the series known as THE WEREWOLF CLUB and I hope the next book is  just as wacky and wonderful as this one.  The illustrations aid a great  deal to the story and serve the writing style very nicely.  Grab a bowl of  pretzels (magic or otherwise) and enjoy.	2000-06-07

Lonely, unpopular Wilma  wishes to be &quot;the most popular kid at Claverford&quot; and ends up  wondering if she really wanted what she wished for.<br />This is a sweet funny  book that examines the road of popularity and true friendship.  It touches  a cord in everyone who ever longed to be popular in school.  Wilma herself  is a believable and very likable girl.  Readers of all ages will easily  identify with her need to fit in.

Gene doesn't  approve of the fact that Alice's mom and dad never married and now are  asked to move out of Gene's house because Alice's father and his new wife  need it.  alice's loyalties are torn between her mom and grandmom and she  struggles to comprehend adult relationships and her place in the world.   But the book rings true to the voices of 10 year olds everywhere.  Alice is  sensitive, quirky British girl and is a likeable believable herioine.  <br />Though I liked the book, the writing style is  a little overly complex  for a children's book...it goes back and forth from Alice's journal entries  to a replay of past events which can make it a bit confusing at times.    American readers may at first be put off by the british dialogue and the  style of writing (deliberately infused with grammatical and spelling  errors, or, as Alice puts it, her &quot;an ilustrated ortobiography&quot;),  but the book is both lively and insightful as is Alive herself.  A great  book for all, especially kids who live in single parent households.	2000-06-07

The book is told mostly through Lisa's point of view, a sweet-tempered, responsible  young woman who knows where she is going in life.  Her world is rocked  apart by the discovery that her mother has breast cancer.   Lisa'a normally  straightlaced life spirals out of control...she begins flunking classes,  alienating her life and gets dunk for the first time.  But oddly all these  events end up giving the normally practical gril an understanding of what  her mother is going through....the uncontrolabilty of disease and it's  aftermath.<br />Lisa is complex character who is easy to relate to - and her  eventual comprhension of her mother's illness is a journey worth taking.  I  would reccomend this novel for anyone dealing with cancer in the  family....especially young adults.	2000-06-06

Practical, level-headed Gwendolyn Wilder doesn't believe in dragons...but the superstitious highlanders of Ballybliss do...and they will do anything they can to rid themselves of the Dragon's curse ....including getting a  fair virgin to satisfy the beast's insatiable appetite. <br />Being the only  virgin in town, Gwendolyn finds herself securely bound to a post as a  sacrificial lamb waiting to be slaughtered - or - more accurately devoured  by this mythical beast. Imagine her surprise when &quot;the dragon&quot;  emerges from a stream of silver smoke to take her away...<br />The  &quot;dragon&quot; turns out to be devastatingly handsome man (though he  hides his face from Gwendolyn) who is much more dangerous than any real  dragon could be....and when he decides to make a &quot;pet&quot; of the  fair Gwen, the fun begins....<br />I discovered Teresa Medeiros with the  wonderful CHARMING THE PRINCE and have been a fan ever since. Her heroines  are usually smart, funny and have a good head on their shoulders....and  Gwendolyn Wilder, the heroine of THE BRIDE AND THE BEAST is no exception.  The Dragon is charming, virile, dangerous and everything a sexy hero should  be.<br />I loved reading this offbeat humorous retelling of Beauty and the  Beast and couldn't put it down. If you like a bit of offbeat humor mixed in  with your romance, this one is for you. Enjoy.	2000-06-06

I found it a little hard to fall for the dark hero, Lord Andrew.  Maybe I just like my heros to be a little less brooding and a little more  charming.  True, Celsiana livens things up a bit, but again, it was hard  for me to sympathise with her.  I just couldn't seem to get involved in  their lives and the plot was just a little much for me to believe.  I did  however enjoy the scenes with Lucien, Andrew's cunning and very  manipulating brother!  I'd very much like to read more about him.<br />THE  DEFIANT ONE is the 3rd book in the de Montforte series, but of course, I  didn't realize that when I started reading.  As I haven't read the first 2  books, THE WILD ONE and THE BELOVED ONE, perhaps that would make all the  difference.  As it stands right now, I can't say that this is my favorate  book by Danelle Harmon.	2000-06-06

She is the  leader of the Clan MacRae (thanks to her father's death) and he is a  powerful english overlord -- and her clan's sworn enemy. <br />Neither can  allow themselves to trust the other. But a defining moment in their past  (once, when they were children, Arion saved Lauren from a tortuous fate),  combined with their shared love for the land bring these two lovers  together, against all odds. To keep safe everything they believe in, they  must become allies and the two headstrong leaders form a risky alliance.  This of course causes strife not only with Lauren's clan, but with Arion's  soldiers. You can probably guess the rest.....<br />Ms. Abe writes with a  touch of the mystical and has a deft hand at describing the beauty and  wildness of the time period. This is an emotional book, with strong sensual  characters. Lauren and Arion are striking figures and a well-matched couple  who stay in your mind long after you finish the book. <br />I think the only  reason I didn't give it higher stars is that I don't normally enjoy serious  historical romances, prefering instead a light, comic approach. Also this  book can be predictable and I saw the ending coming a mile away, but I  still enjoyed the beautiful way it was written. As historicals go, this one  is lyrical and filled with deep emotions. Pick it up especially if you have  a love of Scotland.	2000-06-06

I had high hopes for KNIGHT...especially after reading HIGH ENERGY, a book I thoroughly enjoyed, with well-rounded characters and an interesting  storyline.  But KNIGHT... could never quite capture my attention.  I had no  idea what the hero and  heroine saw in each other.  Both characters are one  dimensional and uninteresting.  I never quite cared about the so-called  quest they were on and frankly would have stopped reading it if it wasn't  for the appearance of the supporting characters of Yaniff (who surely was  Merlin in another dimension!) and the irresistable (or should I say  insatiable?) Rejar.  <br />I can't reccommend this book, but I will say that  having had a glimpse of Rejar, I am looking forward to reading about him  and the woman who finnally tames him in the next book.	1999-06-25

This is my first Dara Joy book, and if this is any indication of her writing talent, it won't be my last.  This is, hands-down, my all-time  favourate romance! It has wit, romance, two very likable main characters  and a host of supporting players worthy of their own book.  (That's my  subtle hint to you, Ms. Joy, if you're reading this -- please write a book  for Mills and Gregor! That's a super couple just waiting to happen!) I have  had crushes on other heroes before, but Tyber Evans is my perfect man (can  I help it if I have a weakness for drop-dead gorgeous rocket scientists  with a wicked sense of humor?)  Tyber and Zanita (hate their names, but  love the couple) remind me of those power couples of the 30's screwball  comedies.  In fact, they are the Nick and Nora for the 90's! Please, Ms.  Joy, consider writing sequels for this couple.  I would love to read about  their continuing adventures!<br />If you are looking for a smart, funny  contemporary romance HIGH ENERGY is it.	1999-06-25
