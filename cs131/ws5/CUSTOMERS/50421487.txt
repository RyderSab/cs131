The title does not do justice to the fact that this is one of the best ABC books available. The illustrations are quite amazing, full of intricate details and laced with humor. My six year old already knows her ABCs well, but thoroughly enjoyed looking at this book and thought the illustrations were absurd and hilarious. Laughter rang from the back seat as she read. It goes beyond &quot;A is for apple, D is for dog&quot; and brings a fresh change of pace to ABC books bringing laughter and enjoyment to a child and awe and applause from a grown-up.	2004-07-23

This caused some problems with the king, so she was not allowed to walk on the pathways like other children. She was not a happy princess until she was given a hill upon which she could run and be a child like other children. The story has absolutely beautiful illustrations, but the story left my daughter wanting more and wondering what happened next. There is no &quot;and she lived happily ever after&quot; ending to this story and misses a bit on the moral aspects - it could have been a nice story about &quot;the grass is always greener&quot; but just doesn't quite hit the mark. For a nice little fairy tale with outstanding illustrations, this would make a terrific gift to a child in the 4 to 8 year old range - especially if they love princesses in fancy pink dresses.	2004-07-23

If you want to go beyond the ho-hum play structure that costs a bundle, and add something to spark the creative child lurking within your child, this book is for you. Ideas like a rill for sailboat races, turning an old tire into a bright blue sailboat sandbox, a fold-away play house, and setting a trampoline flush with the lawn all inspired me. The authors got a bit off course with a section on holidays in the garden, but otherwise a great book - - if you have the energy to actually garden when you have children!	2004-07-21

My 5 year old requests me to read it over and over.  The story is simple - both the bear and his neighbor the bunny decide to grow tomatoes one summer. Bear works hard in his garden, weeding, digging, carefully planting while bunny takes the lazy approach to gardening by just throwing the seeds out to fend for themselves.  Both end up with buckets full of tomatoes - only because Bear has been kind enough to share his bounty with his neighbor, who got not one tomato to grow. Fun, colorful illustrations with humor make this a fun read for parents and children alike. The morals of hard work and sharing make the book a treasure.	2004-02-01

I was not inspired by any of the book's suggestions while looking for ideas for my daughter's upcoming birthday.  There are few illustrations or photographs of actual parties, cakes, or crafts - the pages are filled with oversized clip art- for example a half page photo of Native Americans on the \\"Native American party\\" page, or drawings of zebras on the \\"African party\\" page. Ideas for the African party include hanging a poster of a monkey and serving hot dogs!  How unique and unforgetable is that? The dinosaur party ideas include serving peanut butter sandwiches and having large inflatable dinosaurs for decoration.  How boring. If you need unique ideas, look elsewhere.	2003-02-14

It shows how hard it can be for her grandmother moving from the home she's known for so long, and trying to adjust to her new surroundings. It teaches a lot of empathy for the elderly, but without being preachy. My own daughter calls her grandparents \\"Oma\\" and \\"Opa\\" (German for Grandmother and Grandfather) and although her Oma isn't quite read for retirement yet, and doesn't make cabbage soup and strudel, it really helped bring the story to life for her. Every child can probably find a bit of their own grandparents in the story. The illustrations are as excellent as the story.	2002-11-21

I found this book to be a little misleading...I loved the illustrations - they are darling and sweet and well done. But I found the story line a little too much for my 4 year old. The story is about a wolf who raises a baby duck - not because she loves it, but in order to fatten it up and make a nice juicy dinner for herself. Should I eat it now, or wait until it's bigger so it makes a bigger meal? I know, I know...real wolves eat real ducks in the real world, but I felt uncomfortable reading this storyline to my child at this point. Maybe for ages 5 or 6 and up.	2002-08-27

We all take a little breeze for granted, but this book makes you look at the wind a little differently. It starts off as a day like any other day, a young boy sits and eats his normal breakfast. But then on his way to school, a wind whooshes into town and shakes everything up. But it's not just wind anymore...it is the same wind that ruffled the fur on a polar bear, the same wind that rushed passed the pyramids, and filled the sails of a Viking ship.  What a great book to make you think of something so simple as the wind in a completely different way. Bravo! (and great illustrations too!!)	2002-08-23

It really inspired her to start her own collections. It does spark creativity and looking at what could be mundane items as something interesting unto themselves. The book is done in an unusual montage illustration style, combining cut paper illustrations and photos of real objects. The story is about Hannah, a little girl who is supposed to bring in a collection for show and tell at school. She has so many collections, she can't choose which one to bring. It is a cute book for 4-5 year olds.	2002-08-23

I hoped for more to look at and less to read in a garden design book. It is more of a text book than a book for inspiration. If you are ready to sit down and read the basics on garden design, then this is for you. If you are hoping for inspiration from looking at photos of beautiful gardens, then look elsewhere. There are only 8 photos - before and after photos of the author's own garden.	2002-08-15

My 4 year old daughter still says this is her favorite book, and you know what a short memory 4 year olds can have. She and her dad had a ton of fun reading this book - over and over and over. It is loaded with sly little puns, visual jokes, and a double storyline that will keep the readers enjoying it. It is a fun take off on, you guessed it, Goldilocks and the 3 bears, with a little Alice in Wonderland, and Police Squad thrown in. Great fun!	2002-08-06

The story is basically about sibling rivalry between brother and sister, but with a twist when one rainy day, he gets bored and she gets creative.  I enjoyed all the wonderful ways she can find to keep herself happy and occupied playing by herself on a rainy day. She even turns down the opportunity to watch t.v.  That is a welcome inspiration for all children to read. Maybe your child will be inspired by Opal's fun rainy day boredom busters. I know mine was.	2002-08-06

I found the title to be quite misleading, as the gardens depicted in the book were mostly close ups of plants, or vignettes, and very few garden \\"rooms.\\"  There are no design layouts illlustrated, nor photos of a garden as a whole to give you an idea of how it was divided into outdoor rooms.  The book is primarily text, with one or two large photos per chapter - - not enough to illustrate the concept being discussed. I am a visual person and look at garden books for inspiration. I needed more photographs, less information on how to decorate my dining room table or how to do bonsai. It wasn't what I expected or hoped for in a book about creating stylish outdoor rooms.	2002-08-05

The funny illustrations with their clever details will keep parents laughing, and children with a budding sense of humor will really get catch the giggles from you as you read to them.

Lo and behold she manages to get in the queen's good graces with the help of a big old lie and needs the help of 3 fairies to get out of her predicament. The story is a twist on several familiar fairy tales - with a somewhat happy ending, although the little girl wouldn't say so. The moral? Those who work hard will be rewarded in the end, and the work itself can be its own reward.  Lisa Campbell Ernst always has first rate illustrations which I love, and my daughter is always drawn to stories about princesses and fairies - so this book was an instant hit.	2002-07-18

She still feel unfulfilled until she meets some pigs living in the country and decides to give up her big city ways.  It's a funny story parents will appreciate - especially those who have office jobs.  My daughter wanted me to read it to her over and over.  It does not put down life in a city, just the job and clothes that came with this particular pig's life. Appropriate for children who live in the city or the country.  It is written to encourage children to find the way in life that is right for them individually. Find what makes you happy.	2002-02-24

She is racked with guilt for the trouble she caused the 3 bears so long ago and sets out to repair the damage she had caused. The bears aren't so enthusiastic about her return this time either.

The storyline is simple and not very memorable, but the illustrations are wonderful and the story can help inspire children to think &quot;out of the box&quot;.  If they want to draw an orange pig, go ahead!  The girl in the story is attending art class and chooses to paint her subjects whatever color she feels like. The only drawback is the same as with most pull out tabs - they can get worn and difficult to use with repeated use. And these will get used!  My 3 year old loves it.	2001-11-02

I was not inspired or intrigued by any of the gardens shown.  I do admit that the book may appeal to someone with a very small urban courtyard and a preference for the avant garde style garden. The gardens were mostly minimalist with emphasis on huge graphic shapes imbedded in the lawn or piles of crushed glass layed out in pyramids. Really, an &quot;aluminum garden&quot;?? If there is no plant life, isn't it really just a patio and not a garden? The photography was less than stellar, with several photos out of focus.  The two to three page spreads per design usually just had photographs of the same object from three different angles. I do not recommend this book for anyone who enjoys gardening with plants, discovering new plant varieties, or are looking for inspirations for plant combinations.  The hardscape designs weren't very interesting either.	2001-04-29

News spreads of the fabulous tree and the girl is dutifully encouraged to give it to the King of Spain's  daughter (before the princess has a tantrum.)  The girl's generosity is  rewarded by finding golden wings to fly in the sky and a twig that bears  another magical tree.  The lesson is the art of being generous and giving  away something you truly treasure, so you may be rewarded later.  There are  plenty of whimsical, darling illustrations with easy to read text.  It is  nice to read a book of a different time with period costumes. It is also a  way to teach a little history lesson, of the way it used to be with kings  &amp; queens getting whatever they wanted.

Another  story is about Fanny taking a bath and the odd things one thinks of in the  bathtub.  The stories are of unusual subjects, with unusual illustrations  (how often do you see a pear taking a bubble bath?) with no rhyming text.

After pinching and prodding the girl to discover what kind of thing she is, they help her make enough noise to help the girl's father find her.  Since the story is told from the fox cub's point of view, it's not quite as scary as it could be.  It still might be too scary for 3 or 4 year olds unless a little judicious editing takes place while reading aloud.  The words are a curious mix of rhyme and text, which makes it a bit awkward to read.  The illustrations save the day with the happy little fox faces and cute little girl, and lots of items to point to and name.	2000-06-06

When a stranger sets up camp at the end of town, Duck and Pig automatically assume that because he's a rat, the stranger must be sneaky and lazy and a bad  person.  Only Frog takes the time to actually get to know Rat and form his  own opinion.  Frog not only discovers what a friendly, interesting, and  helpful Rat he is, but gains a new friend.  The story is just long enough  for reading at bedtime, keeps your attention without being too preachy, yet  teaches morals on many different levels.  I think this is a wonderful book  for teaching tolerance for people different from you, as well as how not to  be rude like Pig.  I definitely recommend it!	2000-06-03

The funny stories will have children giggling over the absurdity, along with the wonderful illustrations.  The king is rather  pompous and self-centered, as one would expect of a king, I suppose.  But  he always says &quot;please&quot; when making silly requests of his staff.  The stories are just the right length for a quick story before bedtime.  Everyone is polite and the characters are more like children play-acting as  being king and queen.  Enjoyable!	2000-01-14

The big, bold words are easy for children to read, and the rhyming text is simple.  It encourages children to look for the shapes hidden within each picture.  While it has no real story line, it is valuable as a tool for  learning shapes and colors.  It may be a bit too simplistic for some, if  they are of reading age.  It might be more appropriate as a board book,  rather than a hardcover.	1999-12-22

Mrs. McNosh begins by doing the laundry, but becomes increasingly silly as she hangs more than just shirts and socks up on the line to dry.

The only drawback - - I didn't care  for their choice of typeface, but that's just the designer in me talking!	1999-12-22

The Norbread-Norwaters are yuppy mice who are  overly concerned with their weight.  Marceau is very happy when his parents  return.  He has learned to appreciate his family once again.

A beautifully illustrated book that will provide entertainment as well as many learning opportunities as you travel the world in search of the ingredients necessary to bake an apple pie.  Children learn that food does  not come from the grocery store - it has to be grown, harvested, milled,  and prepared before it arrives magically on the dinner table.  Your  children may come to a new appreciation for the things normally taken for  granted, and learn valuable geography lessons in the process.  Maps and  suggestions for an apple tasting party are included.  I love this book!	1999-12-22

Your only danger in reading this book is that your child may think  the things Mary Louise says after losing her manners are so funny, that  they might want to repeat the words themselves.  The illustrations are  great.  I didn't care for one part in the restaurant where she ties the  bibs on people a little too tight.  That seems less like bad manners and  more like just meanness.  The book will inspire some conversation between  adults and children about manners - something every child needs to learn.	1999-12-22

The story makes you look at normal everyday weather and life in general in a new way.  The pen and ink drawings are well done, but the format is more like a comic book than an illustration with text.  The text comes in boxes  overlayed on the illustrations, which make it seem unplanned and can seem  visually &quot;busy.&quot;  The book is long - not for under age 6.	1999-12-22

Useful for long-term gardeners and those who are just starting to learn. The pages are layed out so 5 years show on a 2page spread, sections for week 1 of  january, week 2 of january, etc.  Categories you can fill in include  weather, flowers(what was blooming when), shrubs &amp; trees, lawns,  vegetables &amp; fruit (when did you plant tomatoes last year? ),  greenhouse, and a section for notes.  There is room for putting down basic  information - this isn't a book for writing down detailed information.  It  is a reference to use morelike a calendar (when was the first hard freeze  in previous years? )  A great book.  I haven't been able to find another  one like it.	1999-12-17
