The author covers the pre and post ABBA phases thoroughly, as well as their time together as ABBA. For a fan, such as I am, the stories were fascinating and this is a must-have autobiography, thus this book will have a permanent place on my bookshelf. However, as another reviewer has stated, Palm has a tendency to be very dry and I'm not sure this book would appeal as much to someone looking for a good music biography rather than an ABBA fan. <BR>This comes across most strongly in Palm's discussion of ABBA's music. Damning with faint praise comes very strongly to mind, particularly in his discussion of Super Trouper. There didn't seem to me any sense that this was a fan of the music (which for all its faults you couldn't say about the 'Name of the Game' by Oldaham et al.)<BR>His post-ABBA opinions are even more scathing, particularly Chess. He complains about the number of styles used - that's the way Lloyd-Webber and Rice worked, and was the template that Benny and Bjorn had to work from.<BR>Nevertheless, a superbly researched book which contains probably as much as anyone needs to know about ABBA's formative years.	2003-02-09

The research is very poor with the result that there are a lot of factual errors in this book. I counted three in the first chapter alone (an example is the scoring system used in Eurovision in 1974). The main one, of course, is the repeated reference to Frida and Agnetha hating each other, which simply wasn't (and isn't) true. Nevertheless, this book is a fun quick read and the author's opinions, which range from comments on ABBA's music (which, in general, they rave about) to pop lyrics in general and musicians in the movies, are lively and entertaining. If you just cut out the personal stuff between the girls, the rest of this book will tell you as much as you ever need to know about ABBA, unless you're more than a casual fan. For those wanting more, 'Bright Lights, Dark Shadows' fills out the details, in a less tabloid fashion - but that still has it's moments of wrong-headedness (the comments in regard to the failure of Chess, in particular)	2003-02-09

That's hardly what it's for! To get 900 birds and this much information into a field guide you had to have had a free magnifying glass to read it. As to complaints that some of its political geography is outdated, Pshaw! A book as good as this takes years to prepare, it's never going to be able to follow the fast changing countries of Eastern Europe. It's irrelvant if Czechoslovakia doesn't exist as a single political entity anymore, everyone knows what area it refers to.<BR>This is a superb achievement but it needs to be judged for what it is not what it doesn't try to be!<BR>If you want a good European bird field guide, the recent Collins book is probably the best field guide for any region ever.	2002-12-19

Some bits will only be of interest to Who fans - the origin of the Sontarans and the retinal scanner trick were very good, but much of the rest will annoy many people - the doctor and Omega relationship was just a rehash of the Three Doctors and Arc, but  because its 'a different universe' there was no reference to those stories.

The most obvious examples of this are the articles on Gilbert and Sullivan and Hayden's Creation which make moderately interesting points but could so easily have been cut in half. There was also far too much repetition within essays and from previous essays. Far too often I felt like I was reading a rehash of a previous article. The Haeckel essay was a perfect example of this - nothing new since Ontogeny. Also as a UK citizen, it's parochial air put me off, especially the introduction where he talks to the audience as if it's solely American (and I speak as an Englishman who thoroughly enjoyed the baseball section of Full House (or as it was retitled for us benighted Brits &quot;Life's Grandeur&quot;))<BR>I'm still happy I bought this book, but for me it's the least of his essay collections.

I found the \\"End of Time\\" extremely disappointing particularly after reading the recommendations on the back of the book. I never knew Jon Turney, John Gribbin and John Barrow to all be so wrong. This book completely lacks any discussions of what a timeless universe implies, indeed it wasn't until the notes that it was clear what the author meant by it. The \\"End of Time\\" is full of pages of argument as to why there is no time, but it's done in a very dull way for the lay reader, and, as the email printed in the notes shows, his thesis has far too many holes to convince more conventional physicists. There was absolutely nothing on what timelessness actually means, no speculation at all (which as a previous reviewer noted may be because there's nothing to predict). A highly worthy but dull book.

In the first two thirds Miller demolishes the arguments of the three major creationist viewpoints, and he does it very politely and clearly. He doesn't do this by creating a straw man and knocking it down, but by showing that scientifically AND theologically creationism is a hollow creation. In particular, he shows that creationism downgrades God as well as evolution.  The last third covers how Miller reconciles his God with evolution. Despite, or perhaps because, his view of God is very mainstream (reading between the lines I think he even believes in transsubstantiation) Miller reconciles God with evolution very easily, by showing that evolution and God is a problem similar to why suffering and why free will, problems religion has to find answers for because they're true, and cannot answer by denying their existence. A previous reviewer stated &quot;Miller's reconciliation of evolution with God's existence seems based on a weak premise; that God designed this whole system so He could create a species evolved enough to recognize and worship Him&quot;. That's the basis of Christianity, Islam and Judaism, whether you believe in evolution or not. I don't believe understanding how Miller came to his faith would have enlightened anyone, as that would be a personal matter whereas this book is designed to show that evolution and religion are not incompatible for anyone with faith no matter how that faith came about. Buy this book, you won't be disappointed.	2001-01-07
