Koestler writes so well that he creates, and what is more difficult maintains, tension throughout the 200 or so pages of the book.  <br /> <br />It is through works like this, about the depths to which humanity can sink, that you begin to appreciate anew the preciousness of life. This work also set me thinking about who I am, no not `existential angst', just what I would do in such a situation. Is this veneer of respectability that we present to the world the real us, will it wash off when we are faced with extreme situations that test our character?  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, this work is not a sloppy moralizing tale about the evils of communism, but it does get you thinking.  <br /> <br />I'd recommend it.	2005-09-14

The First Circle is a story about what happens when the talents of a nation are wasted because those in power happen to be incompetent men (that tends to be generally the case, except New Zealand). At the heart of it, it is a testament to the power of a free market to value resources and direct them to where they are most valued.<br /><br />Well, no, not really. Solzhenitsyn is not a capitalist at heart and his work does not disparage communism. It is a non-partisan look at a cross section of society that had to suffer the loss of lives, loved ones and youth. It is about their hope in spite of the circumstances surrounding them.<br /><br />Solzhenitsyn's earlier work _One day in the life of Ivan Denisovich_ made Soviet society realize the genius that was in their midst. The First Circle cements Solzhenitsyn reputation as one of the greats of modern Russian literature. This book deserves to be in your collection.<br /><br />Trust me, you will not regret reading this. A definite must read!	2005-08-19

Rumpole is a crusader for the poor, the downtrodden and the hopelessly defenseless. His motivations for defending the poor and downtrodden may not be admirable (funding his claret drinking), nor his methods sound (pulling at the heartstrings of the jury rather than legal prowess), but one thing that you can't say about this less than mediocre lawyer is that he isn't exceptional :/ <br /> <br />I may not agree with all of Mortimer's earthly moralizing, but I do appreciate his humor.

What endears Rumpole to readers is his genuineness. In a world where lawyers are portrayed as super-human intellects, it is encouraging that one lawyer has got the guts to poke fun at the profession. <br /> <br />The short stories in Rumpoles last case can be enjoyed in one sitting and are sure to make you smile, even if you don't agree with all of his techniques. Consider Rumpole as a cross between Sherlock Holmes (he loves bloodstains after all) and the Pink Panther.  <br /> <br />This is the type of reading you should reserve for a reward after a hard days work (or play).

The remains of the day was aired on BBC radio, which is where I heard it for the second time, well parts of it at least. They also did an interview with the author which was quite interesting and which led me to get this book.  <br /> <br />The story is about an English butler who, after a lifetime of service, takes a short six-day vacation to see the English countryside and visit an old `professional' lady friend (a former housekeeper at Darlington Hall). <br /> <br />On the trip he thinks back to life in Darlington Hall and has an internal - almost Socratic - dialogue about the meaning of dignity. In the end, Mr Stevens (our butler) reasons that it comes down to `not taking off one's clothes in public.' Ishiguro creates out of a seemingly plain series of events a great introspective work.  <br /> <br />In his interview he mentioned that we; those not in positions of great power or influence, could be considered butlers because we serve others who have authority over us. Whether the analogy is accurate, the point is that most of us serve someone and our sense of fulfillment comes from having done a job well. An interesting issue that the book raises is whether an employee should let his or her conscience get in the way of doing a good job, which was the position that Stevens was placed in at Darlington Hall. <br /> <br />The strange thing about this book is that it feels sparse, Spartan almost. There is economy in the words, the descriptions and even the language itself. I don't know whether Ishiguro deliberately did this, but the book feels like a Japanese garden.  <br /> <br />This is one of those interesting short books that should be read by everyone, I would highly recommend it. <br />	2005-04-01

After Crime and Punishment, I had expected another book that was deep, almost profound, and genuine in its portrayal of humanity and generally a great read - what we'd expect of an author as great as Dostoevsky. What I found instead sounded like the ramblings of someone uncertain of what he wanted to say. <br /> <br />Was this going to be a book about religion, about high society in Russia, about love? About all three? What was Dostoevsky trying to say? Perhaps I was disappointed because the book didn't seem `concentrated', there were so many unnecessary little incidents that distracted from the main storyline (if there was one), that the book lost its thrust. <br />  <br />But I mustn't dissuade you from reading this book. Compared to many other works of fiction, this would be a masterpiece. I must warn you however that if you have heard about Dostoevsky and want to see why there is such a fuss made over him, read something like Crime and Punishment or The Brothers Karamazov rather than this work. <br />	2005-04-01

It is a very personal and at times moving account of lives forgotten by the world but now remembered.  At times the constant repetition of the countless stories does get a bit tiring, not because it's boring but because it seems impossible that such things could happen in this modern world. <br /> <br />I came away from this book learning a lot of personal lessons about life, lessons that, thanks to Solzhenitsyn, I have avoided learning the hard way. For example, that when we hold on to things too tightly we sometimes cause unnecessary suffering by worrying about them. It would be better to be less tied up in our material possessions and give more thought to the weightier matters in life such as our relationships... it sounds clichd I know, but when you are told this lesson by someone whose idea of a possession was one item of clothing on his back, then you begin to gain some perspective. <br /> <br />The style of writing is not very inviting at first, it's almost as if it was stream-of-consciousness writing so at times he may be longwinded and reminisce about one incident for a long time and then suddenly jump to something else that seems completely different. It took me awhile to get used to this, but I promise you, after you get half way and get used to this style of writing, you will be glad you persevered. I would highly recommend this first work to anyone interested in the history of the Soviet Union, a different (human) perspective on Communism or just a great autobiographical work. <br />	2004-12-27

Adams, probably most famous for his hitch hiker's guide, is just as funny in this opus. As usual there are the trademark almost-normal-yet-totally-zany characters such as the 200 year old chronologist, the mechanical monk and the `hero' of the piece; who in ordinary circumstances could be considered a sleazebag, Dirk Gently. .  <br /> <br />If you've read any of Adam's work, you know what to expect in terms of plot, it's totally unpredictable, anything goes, which means you'll have to leave your notions of space and time outside the proverbial door. By the way, the proverbial door features in this book as well, but I won't spoil it for you. <br /> <br />I would give this book a five star rating, were it not for the fact that I think Douglas has some personal grievance against Christianity. His less than subtle jabs at the Christian faith lessen what could have been a thoroughly enjoyable book. However credit must be given where it is due and Adams is definitely a master of the art - a comic extraordinaire (if there is such a thing) - who deserves a read. <br /> <br />	2004-12-27

I don't know Ancient Greek so can't really say which the best version is. I used the Penguin and Loeb Classical Library editions (in two books) and found them both equally good. The English from the Loeb was perhaps slightly more formal than the freer flowing prose in the Penguin. <br /> <br />But if you haven't read the Iliad, and aren't too fussed about which version is truer to the Greek or more `poetic', then your main concern must be if it is worth your time (and money) to invest in this epic.  <br /> <br />At first I did not appreciate the constant \\"and his armor clanged over him\\" which became so repetitious that I began to hear the clanging myself. The relaying of messages, verbatim, was also something that I had to get used to. But after these initial misgivings, I came to enjoy the story. It became engaging and I ended up being attached (if that is possible) to some of the heroes in the novel. I felt for Hector as he tried to protect his city from the devastation that would come about should the Argives gain the upper hand. <br /> <br />The battle scenes were very descriptive. Homer certainly made sure his audience knew exactly what happened, whether the spear punctured the right eye, went in through the kidney or split the head in half. You are even given short biographies of some unknown warrior as he is about to die. Perhaps this is of interest to those studying Homer or Greek literature, but to the average reader it might seem a bit much. I mean, do we really need to know the genealogy of everyone that was involved in the battle? Again, that is something you will have to get used to, as the book progresses. <br />  <br />Even, if you know the story or have seen the recently released Troy, I would suggest you experience the Iliad. Yes, you don't read the Iliad as much as you experience it. I was taken back into a completely foreign culture in a completely different time and yet I found that I could relate to Hector, to Menelaus, to Agamemnon, and yes, even to that braggart Achilles. We should be thankful that Homer's Iliad was preserved so that we, in the 21st century are able to enjoy this masterpiece.  <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this book enough, there are some things that at first will seem strange to you, but persevere, because when you are nearing the end of this book, and indeed after you have finished it, you will wish it was longer. Trust me. Read this book. <br />	2004-09-12

I saw in Pascual, a man like any other whose life could have gone a different way had he made better decisions in life.<br /><br />This isn't a very inspiring story so don't expect to come out of this short book with a sense of having gone through the storm and come out of it a better person - Think \\"Perfect Storm\\" -. This is definitely not one of those books you want to be reading on a rainy day.<br /><br />If you can stomach pain, sorrow and disappointment, then I would recommend this story to you.

Like another reviewer said there is no sense of redemption in it, it is very fatalistic and I guess if you are used to fairytale endings, you could consider it disappointing. <br /> <br />What struck me about this book was the sense of futility that Pascual had when it came to dealing with situations around him. It was as if he had no part to play in his own life, that he was just a victim of fate. <br /> <br />Cela's descriptions of the motivations that drove Pascual draws the reader in and makes him a witness to this man's demise. There are some parts in the book where you know he is going to do the wrong thing but you hope and hope that somehow he will come to his senses and avoid disaster. <br /> <br />Although this is no \\"Crime and Punishment\\" it is an interesting study into the psychology of a killer. Unlike Crime and Punishment however, do not expect to come away from this with a sense of having being cleansed.   <br /> <br />Recommended to those who can put up with pain and disappointment, probably not for everyone. <br />	2004-09-06

In this work, John Locke presents some of this thoughts on how one can improve one's thinking life. The focus is on impartiality when considering issues and a love for the truth rather than a defense of some preconceived ideas. A very short work that can be read and absorbed fairly quickly and has proved to be helpful to me as I put some of those principles into practice when reading the opinions of others, especially political ones. Locke also details some of the procedures one should use in acquiring knowledge, most of which seemed like common-sense ideas, but it felt good reading it from one of the great thinkers of the past. Ideas such as -don't spend time on the non-essentials; focus on the fundamentals or - The continual repetition of a way of critical thinking when you approach works will lead to the formation of a habit, which will then make what was once tiring, effortless or - preoccupation with one branch of knowledge can lead to myopia when looking at problems, therefore one should try, as much as is possible, to go beyond one's speciality. These may appear banal now, but it's good to be reminded of these simple truths once in a while. <br /> <br />If the lack of reviews are anything to go by on, this book must not be a popular one here with amazon readers, if that is so, it is a pity because this short book deserves to be on any thinking persons desk. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking some advice on how to think more clearly or argue more effectively.  <br />	2004-08-10

He begins this book by stating firstly that there really isn't another option to capitalism, so the question is not whether or not a nation should adopt capitalism, but how to make it work. Perhaps this is true, but what is even more important than the truth of this assertion is whether his prescription for change will actually work. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have mentioned, the main focus on the book is property rights, and de Soto comes back to this point throughout. He argues that it is not that the people in the third world don't have money, it's just that they do not possess the formal rights over their property, which is necessary for them to convert it from 'dead' to 'live' capital. <br />This made a lot of sense to me when reading it, because in many third-world nations the legal systems in many cases are too complex for ordinary people or else the law isn't able to enforce simple contracts that are taken for granted in the first world.  <br /> <br />What was missing for me however was the HOW? He mentioned WHY property rights are important, but how do you put this into practice, how do you transform the system of property rights in these nations? I was also disappointed at the way he handled possible problems with property rights such as, the need to educate people on their rights. In the back of my mind was always the thought that if property, especially land, had legal title, rather than being 'communally' owned, as it is in many third world nations, it would make it possible for foreigners to buy out uninformed landowners who would then not have anything else to turn to.   <br /> <br />But one shouldn't expect a book of this length to deal with all possible scenarios. As an earlier reviewer said, de Soto has missionary zeal, and it is infectious, but he should temper that zeal with some consideration for those who are suspicious of capitalism, otherwise it comes across to them as \\"another ploy by the imperialists to steal our land\\". <br />	2004-07-28

Ronald Coase, apart from his economic genius, is an excellent writer. In this series of essays Coase traverses a wide range of topics in the discipline from what part economists should play in public policy to who Alfred Marshall's Uncle was.  <br />As the title of the book suggests, the first seven essays deal with economics, and Coase's views on it. The essays are short, witty (some of them) and never dull. What Coase has to say on \\"How should Economists choose\\" is a must read as he deals with `truth' in the discipline. Is economics the `King' of the social sciences? Coase has something to say on that as well in \\"Economics and Contiguous Disciplines\\" and there are 5 other essays in this section.<br />The next part deals with the lives of some economists, mostly those whom Coase knew personally from England: Marshall, Plant, Black, Pigou &amp; Stigler. The first two essays in this section deal with Marshall's ancestry and are the least interesting essays in the whole book as Coase becomes Sherlock Holmes, seeking out Marshall's true origins. Not particularly interesting stuff. The other essays in this section dealing with economists and the LSE are far more interesting as they give you glimpses of the lives of these great thinkers.<br />A good short read, recommended.	2004-07-01

It also includes useful appendices giving data sources, mathematical formulae for forestry accounting and an explanation of the Output-sustainability correspondence principle.<br />This book is very accessible, and requires only minimal familiarity with national income accounting, and environmental economics.  Chapter 1 is a short history of national income accounts. Chapter 2 discusses the deficiencies of the traditional measures and how economists are trying to incorporate non-economic forms of capital into the accounting framework. Chapter 3 is a brief discussion of how to account for subsoil minerals and what the current problems are that face those who try to measure  these resources, not only measurement problems, but conceptual as well, such as appropriate discount rates when valuing mineral stocks. Chapter 4 discusses renewable and environmental resources focusing on forests and air quality; again the authors discuss the valuation issues both within the U.S (B.E.A) and also overseas. The final chapter deals with recommendations from the panel about what the B.E.A should do, and not surprisingly requests extra funding for the B.E.A to carry out this task. Among the other recommendations, the panel suggests that the B.E.A should work on a comprehensive set of accounts rather than the staged-approach that it had previously followed till it was ordered to cease work on its task. <br />Those who would find this book useful are mostly students of economics and/or the environment. It is quite informative and gives the flavor of what it is those involved in the collection, interpretation and distribution of statistics are involved in. There is not much math (for the math averse) and whatever math is involved is in the Appendix.	2004-07-01

For those of us who did not have the opportunity to learn an instrument at an early age, and who have always considered playing one but have put it off or thought we were too old, Robilliard's book is a great encouragement. No one is too old to learn the piano, (according to her) and she gives examples of people who have started learning it at an advanced age and who have become quite accomplished, even octogenarians (or nonagenarians) can start learning to play the piano and make good progress. Remember that just before his death; Socrates learned to play the flute. It's never too late to learn anything.<br />Robilliard is realistic however and she asks us to look at our ability and aim for goals that are within our reach. Even though one can go on to become a Richter, most of us wont and so we shouldn't compare ourselves with these people but with others similar to us in ability. She dispels the myth that the older one gets the less able one is.<br />\\"...an adult can inhibit his ability to learn by regarding himself as being unduly handicapped as compared with the child. Society, too largely identifies the activity of learning with childhood and adolescence (though this is a social convention dependent on economic factors), and thus the adult assumes that this association is a fact of life\\"...p.20<br />This book is not an instruction manual, or a \\"Teach yourself piano\\" book, it is more like a quick `pep talk' which gently affirms your choice to take up the piano at whatever age, and it serves that purpose well. <br />The book was published in 1967, so some of the recommended material is dated. There is obviously no reference to CDs, MDs, and computer aids etc... There are many forums and websites on the Internet for the adult piano learner and after reading this book, I would recommend you search those out.	2004-06-30

Whenever anyone wants to write a review on a masterpiece, they will no doubt be contradicted by others who either loathed or loved it. So I must remind you that this review reflects my appreciation of Goethe's Faust. I don't know German so I cannot tell you which translation is `the best' nor do I know enough about Goethe himself to tell you if Prudhoe was true to Goethe's meaning.<br />With the above in mind... I was pleasantly surprised when I read Faust. From other reviews and from books that mentioned Faust, I thought it would be an impossible read; lengthy and with so many allegories that you needed to know German (or European) mythology before you could even begin to appreciate it. This is not the case; I think the wonder in this book is the many gems of wisdom that can be found throughout.<br />Take for instance this line where Faust contemplates man's struggle to understand the world around him and find contentment:<br />\\" Man reaches Good on earth and the perceives<br /> the better still remains illusion\\"<br />or Faust's struggles with the two natures that are in most humans, he says<br />\\"two souls, alas are housed within my breast<br />and one would gladly sunder from the other<br />one clamors for the world, it's lust<br />Is shackled to the joys of brute creation<br />The other struggles to ascend from dust<br />To infinity of aspiration\\"<br />Many more such illuminating lines are within this book. I found the interludes with all the mythical creatures, witches, warlocks etc... taxing. I wish those sections had been shorter so that you didn't have to trudge through those before you came to the real story. I guess that is what prevents me from giving this book five stars. To be fair though, in those outlandish scenes, like toward the end on Walpurgis' night ( a kind of Halloween) there are some funny bits, where Goethe mocks critics, skeptics, dogmatists and a host of other `tics' and `ists'.<br />The devil in this play, as you most probably are already aware, is not the scriptural devil, he is more like a smart aleck than anything else, and plays the clown too often to be taken seriously. The only admirable character in this play is Gretelchen, who is pure innocence, love and beauty, although one could possibly identify more with the flawed and human Faust.<br />I have not given a synopsis of the story, it wasn't my intention and I hope I have not given away too much of it. It is a pretty interesting and witty story with the exceptions that I mentioned above. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants something almost on a par with Shakespeare.he scriptural devil, he is more like a smart aleck than anything else, and plays the clown too often to be taken seriously.

US	27548851	RZFO0RT29UMBM	0415041635	67259384	Alternative Economic Indicators	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A good quick introduction into economic indicators.	Victor Anderson's `Alternative Economic Indicators' is a short introduction into why economic indicators as presently used by most Economists (such as the GNP, GDP and even the NNP) are inadequate as measures for the progress a nation makes.<br />He takes into account arguments by the pro-growth and the anti-growth groups, and then tries to work a synthesis that takes both sides views into account. While it would be admirable for us to go back to nature, the majority of people in this world are not content with such a lifestyle and so we must be pragmatic. This book is not a `what we should do' book however. It deals with a very narrow, but quite possibly one of the most important contributions to this whole debate, and that is the indicators that are used to measure `progress' however we define it.<br />He states that we should describe the economy in three ways, financially (as is done presently) from the human or social point of view and lastly the natural world. He then goes on to list what would make good indicators and using his criteria selects a number of present indicators that should be used and given greater prominence. <br />Most of the indicators that he mentions are not new, the old problems that plague statisticians are still present and he admits this, especially lack of data in countries that desperately need to keep data and he argues toward the end (pg. 94) that `there should be financial assistance to Third World countries, through the United Nations, for the development of more adequate systems for collecting and processing statistical information'.<br />All in all, quite an informative book and it would make a great supplement to traditional economic texts or as an introduction to the need for broader measures of man's economic progress.	2004-05-30

This author had made the main ideas that had troubled philosophers accessible to the non-Philosopher; to the average Joe that wanted to know what Philosophy was all about. So when I found out he had written a book about \\"The greatest minds and ideas of all times\\" I knew I had to get it. <br />This book is really short, so you know straight away that he wont be going into too much detail and that the book will have to be really selective about who it discusses. It was unfortunate, to me at least, that Durant had to spend so many pages justifying his selection and thus making the actual discussion of the people and ideas much shorter. Some people received only 2 pages which was a disappointment. It would have been better had Durant instead of justifying himself, written more about those people and ideas which would have justified themselves to the reader. <br />As he admits readily, many of the greatest poets are his favorites, so I think it would be fair to say that his choice of greatest peoples and ideas are not as objective as one might like them to be, but can such a `top 10' or 'top 12' list ever be wholly objective?<br />That said, I would still recommend this book to those wanting to know what Durant thought was important to human civilization over its thousands of years of history. <br />The selection of book Durant gives is quite good, although personally I prefer Mortimer Adler's, which you can get from the Internet or his book \\"How to read a book: - Appendix A\\".	2004-05-30

Their uncaring verdict on the loss of lives from the earthquake in Lisbon coupled with their arrogance and lack of tact in the time of suffering was fuel for Voltaire's fire.<br />The book is fairly short and can be read in one sitting; it is laugh out loud funny in some places as the most absurd things happen to the major characters. I read it mostly because I like satire and not to get any particular message out of it. The story is pretty straightforward and I guess it does raise a few questions in the readers mind about what our purpose in this life is, how to find happiness, contentment etc... but it can also be read for the pleasure of  `listening' to one of the wittiest men that has ever lived (or so they tell me). <br />I have not done justice to this book, and you can read longer reviews about it on this site, but I would advice you to read it yourself and then make up your mind. Get the Penguin edition.<BR>Again, read this book! It's short, it's funny and it's by Voltaire, what other encouragement do you need?	2004-05-21

His combination of wit, insights into life and encyclopedic knowledge of the subject makes this book a page turner.<br />He may have popularized philosophy but he hasn't lost the essence as some other authors have done by watering down the messages. It's still there in its original form but he doesn't use pretentious prose to appear learned. You know he knows what he is talking about without him having to resort to the `specialized' language that other authors speaking about philosophy turn to.<br />This is one great expositor, and he will get you interested in the subject if you were only lukewarm about it before. He explains how a Philosopher develops; he describes the personal influences as well as the societal. You understand by reading him that philosophies do not appear in a vacuum, they are an answer to previous questions and philosophies and the problems most pressing at that time. So you have Durant explaining Schopenhauer's lack of affinity with women and those around him and his almost schizophrenic fear having an effect on his philosophical views. You also understand why Kant wrote the Critique of pure reason and who it was in response to. I found it hard to understand Kant before, but Durant has made his main ideas so lucid that I will now attempt to read _The critique of pure reason._<br />You also get to know the philosophers in a personal way; you feel with Plato the sorrow of losing a master, who goes stoically to his death because he believes in his philosophy. Only a great author can make you feel for someone who lived thousands of years ago.<br />I must make a note to the Christian reader. Many of the philosophers discussed by Durant were Atheists and many of their philosophies were a reaction to the dominant Christian theology at the time. I found though that some of these philosophers were not attacking Christianity per se, but the organized religion that had called itself by that name. I read this book keeping in mind that these philosophies, although very illuminating, are man made and fallible. I think if you are strong in your faith, you can read this book and take some of their bitter attacks against Christianity as their personal views about the subject, without worrying yourself too much. The greatest thing this book did is introduce Philosophy to me in a straightforward way. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with even a fleeting interest in Philosophy. The writing is so plain and clear that the only things that may be difficult to understand are the philosophies themselves rather than the prose. Good luck to you.	2004-05-16

Leonard Silk has written an excellent book about five great Economists of our time. He covers Paul Samuelson, Milton Friedman, John Kenneth Galbraith, Wassily Leontif and Kenneth Boulding.<br />Silk's conversational style makes this book not only informative but interesting as well.<br />He manages to cover both the theory and some personal history which is a great credit to the man, since most books on the lives of Economists usually lean too heavily one way or the other. Silk is not afraid of stepping out of the `academe' and speaking bluntly about some of the areas where Economists have gone wrong. He reserves his harshest criticisms for Friedman, whom he considers not only simplistic, but hiding his political preferences behind the smokescreen of his so-called positive economics.<br />\\"Friedman's methodological insistence on the free market as the basic hypothesis of positive economic analysis conveniently dovetailed with his ideological faith in laissez-faire and his opposition to government controls and planning\\"... p.74<br />This `attack' on Friedman was what made me give this book less than 5 stars, I felt that Silk should have been impartial when discussing these men and saved the venom for another book. He does redeem himself in chapter six however, where he discusses the economic profession in the 1970s and how the movement toward abstract economic analysis was/is making economics lose touch with reality.<br />Silk has some very insightful views into what it is serious Economists should be doing, he likens those economists who would rather work within the strict confines of neo-classical economics to the man who having lost his keys after a late night out, would rather search for it under the streetlight where there is some light rather than on the path he has traveled.  A recommended book for lovers of economics!	2004-05-09

I heard about this `classic' book a long time ago (who hasn't?) but didn't take the time to read it. Just recently, after having my curiosity aroused by the League of Extraordinary Gentleman, I decided to see what the whole thing was about.<br />Griffin, a brilliant English scientist, in the course of his work discovers the ability to make things invisible. But before he is able to properly develop and patent his idea and thereby secure eternal fame, he runs into the problem every scientist who isn't working for NASA faces; a shortage of funds. This, along with his imminent eviction, leads him to take the solution that will make him invisible.<br />The rest of the story deals with his mental descent and we witness genius distorted until it becomes something grotesque. Freed from the restrictions that visibility brings, the Invisible man indulges his fancies at the expense of society. His new powers inflate his ego and cause him to disregard the norms of society; he feels he is beyond them.<br />Along with all this drama, the book has its funny parts -<br />\\"This, this Invisible man, then?\\" asked the man with the black beard with one hand behind him. \\"I guess it's about time we saw him.\\" ...p 114.<br />O.K it may not be laugh out loud funny, but it has its moments. There are many such tragicomic events in the story where you don't know whether to laugh or to feel sympathy toward some of the victims.<br />I felt that the story had merit and it was not altogether improbable. However because of the story's shortness it was unable to develop Griffin's motivations completely. His lack of humanity throughout the book must have had a cause.  Unfortunately Wells was not able to provide a plausible reason for this, as a consequence, the invisible man seemed one dimensional to me since there was no inner conflict; not much agonizing over his actions. You may interpret it differently from me, but this was the impression I got.<br />Overall an interesting book, I guess you could call it a classic, but I'm not totally convinced. Read it anyway to find out for yourself.ould call it a classic, but I'm not totally convinced. Read it anyway to find out for yourself.	2004-05-02

Heilbroner in this book attempts to show what capitalism is, and he looks to a wide range of fields to find the answer. Drawing upon Freud, Smith, Marx and a number of well known economists, philosophers and scholars, he argues that Capitalism is not a state but rather a process, that developed by the inner need of man to dominate and gain power. He contrasts primitive and tributary systems that accumulated surplus for use values with capitalism which seeks surplus for the creation of more surplus; Marx's M-C-M'. The rest of the book builds upon this notion of capital's relentless search for profits. <br />Although you may not completely agree with Heilbroner's analysis of capital, it is important to look into the mirror he holds up to the system we are in. Heilbroner recognizes the defects of socialism and communism as alternatives to the capitalist system, but he also shows that capitalism as a system is built upon domination by the political system and then exploitation by capital of those who rely upon the system for their sustenance. <br />Although it is a relatively short book for the subject matter it covers, it is quite dense. Heilbroner's prose at times was too cryptic for me. I don't know whether he intentionally made the work more difficult than it need be to impress, but he would have succeeded more in his purpose to persuade if he was clearer in his exposition. <br />What was not satisfactorily answered for me is why the appropriation of surplus value by capital is wrong. Heilbroner argues that the return to capital is really a misnomer as it is the appropriation of surplus value created by labor. But surely the capitalist in order to have an incentive to allow the use of his capital and the risk he takes when he enters the market, is entitled to a share of the surplus value of labor. <br />Heilbroner's book is a necessary one for all those who live in a capitalist society. It questions the assumptions upon which our capitalist system is based. For those of you who are free-market fundamentalists, this book should be a sobering experience. I think everyone, of whatever political persuasion, should read this book. After all, if the free market is as good as you think it is, what harm is there in trying to see what some socialist says about it.	2004-04-25

The book covers a wide range of issues from consumer welfare and income distribution to big business and international economics. For each topic (and there are 14 topics altogether) the conservative, liberal and radical views are presented. Given the number of topics there is only limited discussion on each.<br />Carson, Thomas and Hecht have tried to present the basic arguments of each side, while reserving judgment on what they think is the `right' view. They admit that they were tempted to do this, but decided that the reader should be the final judge as to the merits of each argument. Because of this, the essays read as a debate between three economists, each from a different school of thought, but without the jargon usually involved in such debates. On some issues, one side clearly shines but on others there did not seem to be a winner to me. The only caveat here is not to take the representative views here as that actually held by the sides in real life. The arguments employed by actual conservatives , liberals and radicals are obviously much more thorough and realistic. The essays at time make it seem that some of the sides have very simplistic and unrealistic views on life, and the reader may be tempted to believe it especially if it confirms their prior biases. The authors have written a short bibliography for those readers interested in finding out more about the differing views. The bibliography is short, but it lists the major figures that have had a large influence on their respective schools of thought.<br />Carson et al. have done an excellent job by not letting their biases show when relating the three different paradigms, I would highly recommend this book to undergraduates in economics or politics or to any general reader who wants to find out more about the economic arguments employed by conservatives, liberals and radicals when they talk about the economic issues of today.	2004-04-21

There are five novels in this collection with a 'bonus' story which is a really a waste of space. I liked the first three stories the best as these were pretty funny. Adam's humor is similar to Terry Pratchett's (Don't read Pratchett) and having read Pratchett at a much earlier age I could appreciate the weird twists and turns and the countless non-sequiturs. It's the kind of book you'd enjoy if you're used to the type of Monty Python humor. Douglas manages to poke fun at nearly all the professions on earth, and he never lets up in his 'attacks' against the church, most noticable in the last book 'Mostly Harmless'.<br />If you are looking for logical connections between the books, you may be disappointed as these stories seem to develop on their own, with explanations of unexpected twists and turns provided as the book proceeds. Along the way though, Adam's does provide some interesting food for thought about our place in the universe, and about the nature of the universe(s) themselves. His classic thinking-outside-of-the-square style shows when he describes the difficulties faced when dealing with the grammar of time travel. <br />The tone of the last book 'Mostly Harmless' was a bit too serious for my liking, especially after some of the sidesplittingly funny lines in the earlier books. He really did bring the book down to Earth on the last one. All in all, not a bad effort, though as a Christian I had to constantly remind myself that his attacks on religion were his views alone. Even though it's a comedy, this book made me realize the enormity of the universe and our own insignificance in it. <br />Read this book, if you like out of this world comedy.	2004-04-19

Unfortunately there wasn't a sequel and so I had to be content, after reading that amazing novel, to be satisfied with second rate thrillers. Then I saw it, Tides of War and I make no exaggeration when I say I was beside myself. Could this book ever equal a book as great as Gates of Fire? After having read it, I can honestly say it's pretty darn close.<br />There are differences between the two novels that make comparison difficult though. For instance, there are three layers to the story, whereas Gates of fire was a pretty straightforward read. It's been told by Jason, (one of our narrators) to his grandchild, who is in turn being told the story by Polemides, a client of his who was on trial for the murder of Alcibiades, the hero in our story. This may be a novel way of presenting the story, but at some points it gets to be distracting. For example when there is a shift in the narration from Polemides to Jason (the Grandfather) and then back again, it's like starting and then stopping only to start again. I would have preferred it to just flow, the story is engaging enough, it doesn't need a unique presentation style to catch the reader's attention.<br />That aside though, the book is a near-masterpiece. If one overlooks whatever minor historical inaccuracies there may be, you will get to appreciate Pressfield's gift of making the dry subject of history come alive. There are alot of memorable passages in the story and Alcibiades, our hero, is not presented as an immortal - who can do no wrong - but as a human who did not let his failures drag him down. <br />After reading this novel, I felt I had, like Alcibiades, 'dined on dreams'. Read this book. <br />P.S: Please Mr. Pressfield, write another book on Sparta.	2004-03-11

This series of lectures sheds light on the major contributors to Economic thought since Plato and Aristotle. Since the book is made up of transcripts of his lectures, he doesn't manage to cover the figures or the ideas in depth. However he does manage to give some guidelines as to what you should read if you want to be well informed on the history of Economic thought. <br />I did not find the language in it frustrating, it just made the book seem like a personal lecture with Robbins (minus the questions) which added to my enjoyment. He stops at Fisher, so if you were hoping for ideas and icons after that, you will be disappointed. <br />The book is split into five sections. The first deals with those philosophers that preceded the formal study of economics; Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas etc... Very interesting stuff, especially if you aren't familiar with the relationship between the ancients and economics.<br />The second to the fourth sections deal with famous economists, from Adam Smith to Karl Marx. His treatment of Marx is brief so don't expect anything more than a few pages. While he goes into some length about Adam Smith and the other classical economists. <br />Finally he lectures on Jevons, Menger and others of the &quot;Marginal Revolution&quot;, ending his series of lectures with Fisher. <br />A good read, I would recommend it to undergraduates in Economics or any one else who is interested in the history of economic ideas.	2004-03-11

It presents differing viewpoints about the rise of Communism and the involvement of the U.S.S.R and other foreign nations in China during those years. There is a wide selection of authors which gives a sample for those wishing to read more indepth articles and books. The editors do a great job of linking together the various articles and giving brief introductions to and explanations of them. Be warned however that some of the articles are quite biased toward one side or the other. The editors have tried to balance it out so as to present what could be considered the middle ground. <br />The history is interesting, especially as it is coming straight from the horses mouth and you feel as if you are actually living during those years. Although there are more recent books on this subject, &quot;Republican China&quot; is still a great introduction.	2004-03-03

In fact it is considered by many to be a classic. For me it was the ideas, which may have been ahead of their time, rather than the actual style of writing itself which deserves to be commended.<br />The future is filled with robotic humanbeings who have been conditioned by 'early childhood training', constant reinforcement, subliminal messages and a breeding program that would eclipse any envisioned by those in the third reich. These humans, if you can call them that, are devoid of any individuality, embracing their oneness with the rest of humankind rather than glorying in their diversity.<br />Their drug-induced happiness, and total submission to authority and the order of things is any freedom loving human-being's nightmare. Amidst all these drones, there is miraculously one man who does not accept the status quo. One who questions, and it is his questioning of the system that leads to his discovery of John Savage, a 'free-born' human being. John Savage's introduction to this brave new world disgusts him. Instead of being overawed by their 'progress' he reels back in horror when he realizes that they have killed the human soul; the only part of them that made them truly human.<br />An interesting sidenote, Huxley quotes Shakespeare extensively through John Savage's character. It could be an interesting exercise trying to work out which Shakespearean works the quotations come from.<br />Read Huxley's book to get a glimpse of a possible future. Even though our future may not be as extreme as Huxley imagines it, there are some similarities between both worlds even today.	2004-03-03

The release however is made to look like an escape by Harry. In his possession is a list exposing high-ranking officials as undercover Nazis. The list and Harry's reputation are intended to spark a McCarthy-like persecution of innocent individuals who in reality are opposed to Nazism. <br />The rest of the book deals with Harry's death and his younger brother's attempt to avenge it. The last part of the story would have been believable had the \\"New Hitler\\" not been related to Drew's love interest, Karin De Vries. (The love story should have been omitted in my opinion) This is such a disappointment after waiting so long to find out who he is, and what motivated him etc... To add on to the disappointment, some of the 'twists' in the story can be seen a hundred pages ahead which doesn't do much for a 'thriller'.<br />This is the first Ludlum book I have read, so I have not been able to compare it to his other works. All in all, not a bad book. Just don't feel so disappointed when you reach the end.	2004-03-03

It is difficult for someone who has not lived through the Second World War to appreciate the impact that the war had on the lives of the people - both civilian and military - during that time.<br />I will not claim that this book made me realize that, but it did create a thirst to find out more about this period in history. For those who lived through World War two and actually served in it, this book is a monument to their sacrifices.<br />Matanle presents the war in sections, beginning with his analysis of the probable causes of the Second World War, proceeding through the various theatres of the war and the operations within them and then concluding with the impact of the war on the world.

Stevenson deals with the dual nature of `man' and his (or her) battle within himself. The plot is quite simple and it may have been this simplicity that gave the story its popularity.

OK, I'll admit I haven't read all the other accounts, but this one gives all the information any interested person needs to know about the trial without getting mired in needless detail. Plus it's written in narrative style and the Tusa's personal observations are side splittingly funny at times (Hard to imagine for such a serious topic, but they do it)<br />The book begins before the actual trial and details the discussions that the four powers had about the trial - what the scope of it would be, which countries would be represented, what the charges would be, who would fund it etc... The actual pre-trial preparation was such a mammoth task and this book helps the reader appreciate the difficulties facing the judges, lawyers and administrative staff.<br />After this introduction, we get a view of the prosecution and defence teams and the judges. The Tusas have done an excellent job by bringing us behind the scenes of the actual trail and getting us up close and personal with the 'stars' at the trial. They help us understand where the judges are coming from and how the different systems make it difficult for them to agree on certain aspects of the trial - very accessible to those who aren't lawyers. <br />What is the more interesting part of this book is the character studies of the various defendants. The Tusas have succeeded in making these men come alive. I was reminded of the movie Nuremburg with Alec Baldwin when I read the description of Goering and Speer. (Incidentally that would be an excellent movie to watch after reading this book.). The cases against these men are explained both from the prosecution and the defence side. Heavy sarcasm lightens the mood especially when some of the heinous crimes are described; it is amazing the blatant lies that some of these 'leaders' told when faced with their crimes.<br />There is a short section on the case against Organizations; the SS, SA, Gestapo etc... which is followed by the verdicts and the executions. I think that this book is fairly unbiased and factual (there are references at the end of each chapter and it's from the BBC J ) I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the second world war and especially the part that the Germans played in it.	2004-01-31

Mr Verloc is a `closet' anarchist and a secret agent. Much of his work to date has been of the sedentary type, until the appearance of the smooth talking Mr Vladimir. Dissatisfied with the lack of action by Mr Verloc, he threatens to fire him if he doesn't do something dramatic soon. The suggestion is to blow up the Greenwich observatory in order to wake the slumbering middle classes.<br />This causes Mr Verloc weeks of anguish as he tries to figure out how to go about this task. His anguish is so much like that of Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov. (The similarity is not accidental; Conrad was heavily influenced by Dostoevksy's style). He finally manages to find a way out of his predicament and it is here where the plot gets thicker. The final quarter of the book is where the real action is, and the twists and turns aren't as predictable as you first make it out to be.<br /><br />For those brought up on the quick, descriptive style of the modern novels, Conrad's roundabout way of saying things can get a bit irritating, but then that is what makes a classic right? Whatever your preference, I would recommend this book to those who like a good detective novel with a dose of non-conventional `philosophy' thrown in.	2004-01-31

All this was possible - aside from many other factors - because of the genius of one man: Lee Kuan Yew. This book is the story of his quest to change Singapore.<br />The first part of the book deals with the various projects he initiated or oversaw that changed Singapore. Lee Kuan Yew gives an overview of what he did to deal with those problems facing every developing nation - crime, education, housing, investment etc...<BR>Reading his memoirs, one cannot help but admire this man's moral character and sense of purpose, other leaders of developing nations would do well to learn from this man.<br />The second part of the book gives Mr Yew's views on nearly every country Singapore has had significant dealings with. His views are, as he himself says on many occasions, not meant to be politically correct. This means that those fluent in `diplomatese' may find his language crude and some of his views upsetting.<br />Not surprisingly the last part of the book, which deals with his family and his personal life is very brief. Given the formal tone throughout, it would not be in keeping to speak at length about his own personal life, although no doubt that would be interesting reading.<br />For those students of economics or politics and for those curious about Singapore or the Asia-Pacific region in general, I would highly recommend this book. The writing is extremely clear and the chapters are arranged in a logical order, (unlike the haphazard ranting in other memoirs) which makes reading a pleasure rather than a pain. Read this book to be inspired.	2004-01-31

That's what you'll need if you want to read this book, especially if you aren't Russian or a Sovietologist (do they still exist?). The division of the book is into four parts, the first deals with the years before he took the helm in the former USSR. This is the part that you really have to slog it out, especially with the names, places, and also the various positions that he held in the Communist party (the glossary at the end is definitely necessary)... For me this was the least interesting part of the book and if you can get over this initial hump, the rest of the book is very interesting and of course informative. <br />The second part is especially interesting since it deals with Gorbachev's ascent into the highest seat in the Soviet Union. He goes into quite some length dealing with the issues surrounding Perestroika and the difficulties involved in making Perestroika work. He is good enough to give the reader some background information on the Communist party, its structures, and the founding fathers, Lenin and Stalin, as well as his other predecessors, Brezhnev, Adropov etc...Quite personal at times and very insightful, especially for those who aren't very familiar with the former Soviet Union.<br />Part III, which deals with the USSR's relationship with the outside world is a must read, especially as it deals with how Gorbachev, and not the U.S was the one who began the process that culminated in the end of the \\"Cold war\\". Gorbachev also speaks about how Yeltsin's lust for power was one of the factors that led to the breakup of the Soviet Union, and here perhaps the reader would be wise to consult other books that give Yeltsin's point of view.  <br />The 1991 coup is dealt with in the last part. It is a very personal account of the coup with some private notes from his wife, Raisa Maksimovna's journal. You can't help but pity him for the treatment he received at the hands of Boris Yeltsin after his resignation.<BR>This is quite alengthy book, but well worth the effort. I'd suggest this book to anyone interested in the history of Russia or Perestroika and the man behind it.	2004-01-31

Quentin Tarantino must surely have got his inspiration for his senseless and bloody scenes from this Shakespearean play. For those lovers of blood and gore, you will be delighted in this play. Shakespeare starts with the usual beheadings, but then in a stroke of mad `genius' decides to up the ante and add mutilations, rape, cannibalism, betrayal, setups, murder and a host of other villainous acts to shock the audience. The only ones who will be disappointed are those who love eye gouging, but rest assured, Shakespeare has pretty much covered everything else.<br />The racism in the play is sickening. At every opportunity, Aaron the moor is self deprecating, equating his blackness with evil and calling himself slave, thick-lipped etc. I am hardly a fan of political correctness, but why the excessive name calling. It seems Shakespeare had this racist streak in him, which may have been a product of his times. Check out Othello and The Merchant of Venice for more evidence of this.<br />The `hero' in the play, Titus Andronicus was someone I had much difficulty sympathizing with, probably because of the improbability of losing more than 20 sons to a war, and his lack of mercy at the beginning of the play which started everything else. His near lapse into insanity is reminiscent of King Lear and both plays share the same theme of ingratitude: in Lear it is the ingratitude of his daughters while here it is the ingratitude of the state.<br />I would not recommend this book to those who want to read some good Shakespearean drama. Try King Lear instead.	2003-11-22

Whatever tragedy may have occurred in the beginning - at the court - is totally forgotten when the action moves to the forest, where Robin-hood like; a banished duke, a melancholy philosopher and a cast of love sick characters act out their lives on the stage.<br />Much of the play is centered on Rosalind - the female lead in 'drag' - who falls in love with the third son of a nobleman, Orlando, who has been cheated out of his inheritance by his eldest brother. Her father, the duke, has also been cheated by a brother and is now living in the forest with his `merry men'. Her short stay at court is disrupted when her uncle changes his mind about her and `graciously' gives her a few days to get out of the kingdom. This event leads to her escape into the forests with her cousin, the daughter of the duke at Court. As the play progresses more and more characters end up in the forest which becomes the stage where all these actors play out their parts - to paraphrase Jacques.<br />As a reader you sometimes have to suspend rationality in order to swallow some of the larger than life events that occur in this story (The snake - Lion - Lion killer scene for example). It's not meant to be taken too seriously I'd imagine, just a play about love and romance and the lengths one will go to because of love. The only rational person in this play seems to be the Malvolio-like Jacques, whose deer hugging antiques (forerunner of modern day Environmentalism?) and refusal to take part in the revelry make him the butt of the other's jokes. Even the clown seems to have been pierced by Cupid's arrows as he too weds a country `wench', something unheard of in the other plays where the clowns all seem to be eunuchs.<br />If you're reeling from any of Shakespeare's tragedies, or want to escape the ordered, (courtly?) existence that is your life and take a dive into an almost fantasy-like world where all is love and laughter, this play may be your ticket.play may be your ticket.	2003-11-20

Rarely will you ever hear anyone say The Winter's tale, but is its lack of popularity due to it being any lesser than Shakespeare's other works? Unfortunately I would have to say yes.<br />The play is taken from Greene's Pandosto and follows it quite closely in most parts. The plot is fairly simple, Leontes, the King of Sicilia gets into a jealous rage over his what he believes is his wife's infidelity with his friend. This causes him to break off a close relationship with his childhood friend the King of Bohemia and his servant Camillo. He also banishes his daughter, and kills his wife and son by flouting Apollo's judgement that Hermione, his wife, is innocent.<br />The second part of the play is concerned with the reunion of his banished daughter and her newly acquired husband with Leontes. There is a surprise at the ending which I will not spoil for those who have not yet had the opportunity to read the play.<br />If you've read Othello, you will find similarities between Othello and Leontes and also between Desdemona and Hermione. The only major difference is that there is no Iago in this play; Leontes is his own Iago. Shakespeare in Othello develops the reasons for Othello's suspicion of Desdemona, unfortunately this is lacking in The Winter's Tale. There is not much of a motive and the reader (or audience) is asked to believe that Leontes develops his jealous rage over one minor incident and almost immediately.<br />Another problem I have with this play is with the surprise ending. Here again, there is not much of a clue as to how this happens, it is just assumed that we will accept it unquestioningly as fact. Apart from these minor `faults' the play is still an interesting read, and as always the inclusion of the clowns and Autolycus give it some lightness which balances the tragedies.<br />If you'd like to dive deeper into the play, I'd suggest the commentary by Fitzroy Pyle (1969) which I found to be quite helpful.I'd suggest the commentary by Fitzroy Pyle (1969) which I found to be quite helpful.	2003-11-18

The trick I believe is to persevere; like any good thing, once you have mastered it, you begin to feel a sense of accomplishment. This greatly enhances your enjoyment of the plays.<br />King Lear is a play about honoring one's parents, a very relevant lesson for those of us in the modern world. As with many of Shakespeare's other plays, the language may be old but the lessons are still as relevant as ever. Lear, the King of England gives his blessing and lands to two of his daughters based on their outward show of affection for him, while neglecting his third; Cordelia, because she would rather show her love than make an outward display \\" my love's more richer than my tongue\\". It turns out that her two daughters deeds are contrary to their words and the rest of the play deals with Lear almost going mad at the ingratitude and lack of respect shown to him by his two daughters.<br />There is another subplot with the earl of Gloucester being deceived by his illegitimate son into wanting to kill his other son, Edgar.  The story unfolds with two of these men, Lear and Gloucester being mistreated by their children who outwardly show love but inwardly have cold and calculating hearts. As with other tragedies, there must be deaths and disappointment, and King Lear is full of them. Unlike Othello however, King Lear does not have a very depressing ending and there is a feeling that everything will be alright, life goes on in other words.<br />I have tried to outline very briefly what this play is about and hopefully have shown a little of what is inside this very rich play. I would recommend King Lear to anyone wanting to read Shakespeare, I would also recommend you read it in the original language because even though it may be more difficult to comprehend, the language is richer and you will be reading Shakespeare and not some modern editor's idea of him.ill be reading Shakespeare and not some modern editor's idea of him.	2003-11-18
US	27548851	R72IAOZV27FEM	0198320272	43217624	Julius Caesar (Oxford School Shakespeare Series)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Et tu Brute? Betrayal, Power and Pride	We've all heard how great Shakespeare is, how the `experts' say he is the undisputed King of English Literature. Many books have been written about his plays and sonnets, explaining the intricacies of his verse and the subtlety in the lines. His command of the English language is phenomenal and his works have been rightfully showered with praise. To me, however it is not Shakespeare's technical genius that draws people, rather it is his keen insight into human nature. This makes his plays still relevant in our modern age.<br />Some would argue about with the need to read plays that have outdated words and a style of speaking that is so foreign to our day and age. Now, I am definitely not an English scholar, but I'm pretty sure that the majority of the people that attended Shakespeare's play did not speak in the way that Shakespeare's characters do, but they still loved it not so much for the style of speaking but for the way Shakespeare was able to speak what many people had trouble grasping in their own mind. This is what made Shakespeare a genius in my opinion. <br />I read this play some years back and loved it then, but just recently I decided to read the play aloud with my girlfriend. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I think this is the way the play was meant to be `absorbed'; by listening to the characters speak. Find someone with whom you can read the play aloud, failing that try reading it aloud rather than in your mind, (although this is not as much fun). <br />Julius Ceasar, as you have no doubt divined from the other reviews is about (you guessed it) Julius Ceasar and his triumph over Pompey, and about the band of conspirators who would remove him from power. There are a lot of memorable lines in the play, which you must have heard elsewhere such as \\"Cowards day many times before their deaths\\" or the excellent passage about seizing the opportunity \\"There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune...\\" Read the play to findthese and many more other gems. <br />Julius Ceasar is a very short play; only a few pages and shouldn't take long to read. The joy from reading it outweighs whatever difficulties there may be in comprehension due to the language. I recommend this book to everyone wanting to find out why Shakespeare is the greatest playwright ever.	2003-11-04
US	27548851	R6VF8P4RG7X0T	0671722778	43217624	Merchant of Venice (Folger Shakespeare Library)	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Far from his best, but still a worthy read	Shakespeare borders on anti-Semitism in this play. In nearly every scene, the Jewish Character is either reminded he is a dog, or that he is evil because of being a Jew and this extends to his daughter; Jessica, whom the stupid clown Lancelot considers to be cursed because of the fact that she is a Jewess.<br />I think the racism in the play spoiled what would have been a funny and enjoyable read. I was trying to convince myself that Shakespeare was not trying to group all Jews together and that Shylock was just a greedy and unfeeling person who just happened to be Jewish. This is all very hard to do looking back from our time at all the atrocities committed against the Jews because of such racist propaganda (even the unknowingly racist).<br />Another thing I have issue with is Portia's testing of her husband to see whether he is faithful, and the fact that she forged a document, plus she impersonated another person , lied about devoting her time to God etc... It lessens her status as a heroine and makes her out to be worse than Shylock in that she employed questionable techniques to free the Merchant of Venice; Antonio. The end never justifies the means.<br />The only real hero in this play, to me was Antonio, although I think Shakespeare made his character to be less realistic with his lack of conflict and complete goodness, a trait that is hard to find in human beings.<br />All these are my opinions and I think you have to read the play itself to determine whether it is racist. On the upside, the story is interesting and full of suspense (for something of its length) and very funny in parts. Check out Portia's description of her suitors for example. All in all, a good play but definitely not his best because of the racism and the lifeless Merchant of Venice.	2003-11-04

We must have read the play at least three times, watched the movie (with Lawrence Fishburne) twice and read some of the accompanying notes. The first time we went thru it, the thing that struck me was the deceptiveness of Iago. He stands out in the book as the embodiment of true evil because of his ability to manipulate and deceive. His presence fills every scene he is in and Shakespeare doesn't give us the chance to see any redeeming qualities of this man.<br />Character studies are only one way to look at Othello. There are countless books on the market that dissect the play, exploring it from all angles, explaining the themes that Shakespeare explores, whether it be inter-racial marriage, jealousy or the evil nature of Iago and I would recommend you search these `aids' out if you are doing a study of  Othello for your English class.<br />Apart from Shakespeare's literary genius, most of his stories also have a moral behind them. The ones that stood out the most in Othello were the need for trust in a relationship and the dangers of jealousy unchecked. If you haven't ever read this play, or made the excuse that the language is daunting, you are truly missing out on a masterpiece of English literature.<br />I consider this play one of Shakespeare's great tragedies along with Hamlet and Julius Ceasar but the only really tragic thing about Othello is reading the play and coming away from it without learning anything new about life. Now that would be a tragedy indeed!	2003-10-21

What can I tell you that you have not already read and reread about this book. You probably know the outline well enough by now, and no doubt know how Raskolnikov; a deluded young intellectual, is the `hero' in our story. You probably read in the previous reviews about how skillfully Dostoevsky weaves together the different narratives into a single story... about how it is a psychological thriller, and about the themes of redemption, love and faith that run through the book.<br />So what can I add that is unique? I find that when I read reviews I can identify with certain reviewers because of their experience or their reasons for reading. If like me, you have a desire to change the world (or your corner of it) for good, are dissatisfied with the status quo and want radical change, maybe this book is for you. Raskolnikov is like every young person that wants to be different, that wants to do something that hasn't been done before. Someone not content with being mediocre, being like the other `idiots' that inhabit the world, someone who feels he has a need to prove himself to the world. It is especially to these people that the books speaks as a warning not to forsake one's humanity for an idea. <BR> <BR>This is only one of many themes and I can not hope to do the book justice in so short a review. Dostoevsky is definitely a giant in literature, and this book is evidence of his genius. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a powerful and moving story.	2003-09-12

I had reservations at first about reading a book about Africa by a westerner. They are either usually condescending in their tone or so romantic that most people disregard their work as fantasies. Maier, I am glad to say, was neither. <br />In my opinion, the book is an unbiased look at what is wrong with most of Africa today. Maier suggests bad leadership, the lingering effects of colonization and a disavowal of their past as some of the major culprits. Although the evidence is far from convincing, one cannot easily shrug off his suggestions, which appear to make sense. <br />Personally, what was more interesting was the stories of Africans, who against all odds, are striving to make their continent a better place. Maier shows us Africa, warts and all, but puts its problems into context, which gives us room for hope. <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is remotely interested in Africa. It is a realistic look at the state of the continent today, and it will not leave you despairing at the end, like so many other books that are currently out there.	2003-08-23
