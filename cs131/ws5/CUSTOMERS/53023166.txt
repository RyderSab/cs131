Retired and later widowed, she wrote her experiences and is now known as an authority on lightkeeping on the Maine Coast.  She currently lives in Portsmouth, N.H.<br />  This is a thoroughly delightful book about a way of life that has almost become extinct, but which the memories and lessons are preserved to our great edification.  -DMM	1997-12-12

Since it is written for people with no previous training in either the subject of crystals or the subject of light, the first six chapters tell what sort of thing a crystal is and the seventh tells about some of its physical properties.  The remaining chapters describe some of the effects produced on light, mainly polarized light, by crystals and so constitute an introduction to optical crystallography.&quot;<br />  My copy of several years ago came with a piece of polarizing film; don't know whether this is still included, if not one can order a sheet from Edmund Scientific catalog.  This little book is clearly, lucidly written for the student and the amateur.	1997-12-02

This text is practically a college course in its coverage, although is lucid and easier to understand, assuming no special background in physics or chemistry, but written for the layman who wants to learn.  This book in many cases will be easier, more convenient, enjoyable, and less expensive than a college course.  Originally published in 1964, it was published in 1966 as Mineralogy: A First Course.<br />  Part I is on the basics of mineralogy:  Collecting and history of mineralogy, Atoms in minerals, Classification of Minerals, Crystal Growth, Geometry of Crystals (this section on crystallography, long a subject found difficult by amateurs, explains concepts in simple language and may be best treatment of this for the amateur), Physical Properties, Specific Gravity (including a homemade meter), Optical Properties (and some homemade devices to utilize these), Formation and Association of Minerals, and Identification Procedures.<br />  Part II is Descriptive Mineralogy, covering over 250 species, with crystal drawings, a few good b&amp;w photos, their physical features, means of identification, occurrences.  An advantage of this text over many others are the many goniometric crystal angles included which help to identify minerals.<br />  Appendices include lists based upon various properties, bibliography, and index.<br />  Although a useful reference, this book is also good to Read rather just use as a reference.  For the learning amateur, this rates a 9 or 10. -DMM	1997-12-02

Its subtitle on the dust jacket says it is a complete reference work on collecting and fashioning minerals, but it is even better than the subtitle indicates.  This gives an explanation of just about every aspect of the mineral world that is of interest to the collector.<br />  Its introduction includes an interesting history of the study of minerals.  It contains a chapter on the chemistry of minerals, written for the layman yet accurate.  The chapter on the Crystalline State considers how crystals grow, with helpful diagrams, habits, crystal structure, symmetry, systems, and optical properties, an otherwise difficult subject written simply for the layman.  Another chapter deals with geolgy and the types of deposits minerals are found in, and how to collect, label, etc.  A section on ecomonic geology and the interaction of mineral collectors and mines.  A chapter on identification of minerals, mostly by their various physical properties (a superb diagram of a home-made specific gravity balance is included!), and a chapter on the fashioning of gemstones.  A chapter on conserving and displaying mineral specimens, along with cleaning hints (Note: despite the book, hydrofluoric acid, HF, is NOT recommended for any amateur as this is extremely dangerous; this is the only disagreement or fault that the reviewer found with the book).  Also storage, display, and cataloging.<br />  Nearly half of the book is descriptions of minerals, many accompanied by color photographs.  This is, however, not an identification guide (use the recommended guide by Pough for that), nor does it cover all species, but the more common ones.  This is, instead, a sort of encyclopedia to simply learn by and to enjoy.  This is followed by a bibliography containing over 60 excellent references for further study, and an index.<br/>  Although not an identification guide, nor a college text, it yet intelligently explains in layman's language some aspects only covered in technical jargon in the usual textbooks, aspects which the amateur may have been curious about but has not studied.  This is a superb book for the one who wished to be guided, as if by a museum tour, through the world of minerals.  The photographs are wonderful, mostly correlated with the text.  The text is accurate, respects the intelligence of the layman, and is clear.  It is obvious that the author knows and loves the subject, and has spent a great amount of time and thought in the preparation of this book.  I hope he is a mineral museum curator, as his tours would certainly be booked up full.  For a tour of the world of minerals and of their collecting, this is nearly as good as a trip to a museuma, and you won't have to wait in line!   -DM	1997-12-02

Not a guide to localities, nor a descriptive mineralogy (see the author's excellent mineralogy text for that); this tells HOW to collect minerals.  Chapters cover field trips, tools and how to use them, rock classes and how to recognize them, how mineral deposits form, field features of mineral deposits (pegmatites, sulfide veins, basalt and diabase sills, alpine vugs, etc.), collecting practices, preparation of specimens (cleaning, trimming, and preservation), storage and exhibit (labelling, cataloging, assembling and arrangement), with useful appendices, bibliography, and index.<br />  I bought an edition years ago and soon found it very useful, particularly the section on Tools and How to Use Them.

The mysterious cult that changed her cannot bend her will to their purpose; she escapes, assumes an alias, and rises, aided by her powers and a great deal of effort, to become a Space board investigator, wherein she solves crimes that may have been perpetrated by her abductors.  Her abductors having blocked many of her memories before she was able to escape, she has to piece together her own history to get a sense of who she is, and piece together clues as to what the cult are about; she is aided in this by her friend Blake Redfield.<br /> After having gone through crises and adventures (each gripping adventure being covered by a volume of this series), she learns more of her history.

This text is often used in college mineralogy courses.  As one having considerable experience with minerals before taking the college course, I found the 21st edition a distinct improvement over the two previous editions.<br />  The strengths of this edition are in its treatment of crystallography and of crystal chemistry (however, Bloss' Crystallography and Crystal Chemistry covers this well), mineral chemistry (compositional variation in minerals, calculation of analyses, etc.), x-ray crystallography, mineral stability diagrams, good line crystal diagrams in its systematic section, and a usefully organized index.  Although this reviewer has often disliked determinative tables as a waste of space (checking entries takes time but is educational), those in this edition have been found useful to students.<br />  A few weaknesses are the removal of interfacial angles from this edition (even cleavage angles may aid in identification), the absence (except for hydrochloric acid upon a few carbonates) of most simple chemical tests upon samples, using cheap hardware store acids and reagents, and the absence of any passing reference to the subject of blowpipe analysis, a historical adjunct that served mineralogy as much as the Bunsen burner served chemistry.  Although that is a separate subject not possibly treated adequately within a one-semester course, and not generally treated in college courses today, it is a historic part of our mineralogical heritage, and often can serve a useful purpose in the aid of identification of commoner species.  A few notes as to its place in history, and a few text references for further study, would have been appreciated.  However, the Field Guide to Rocks and Minerals, by Frederick H. Pough (Peterson field guide series) may serve as a useful complement to this text.<br />  This could use rewording in a few places, as some sentence structure (indeed some formula structure) may be found ambiguous, an example being formulas on page 75 to finda and c, which are not clear as to whether parts of these, as in the last paragraph on said page, are in the numerator or in the denominator... Another example is the use of the stereographic net, which I had quite a time figuring out from the text, and when I did I rewrote directions and pinned them up on the bulletin board of the geology dept.  Kudos, however, to whomever put the stereonet inside the back cover of the text with the suggestion to photocopy it for use.  Also the list, two pages past the last numbered page, of locations of some key tables and illustrations.  Clarity of language is important to a student desiring to learn more about some aspect of the subject.<br />  It is difficult to rate books upon a number system, as objective reasons and examples are more informative.  The rating, which seems to be required, is an average based upon my own personal opinion: 6.7.  [DMM]	1997-11-17

The first edition was described by the editors of Chemical News in 1879 (v.40, p.287) as &quot;dsitinctly the clearest, most systematic, and most useful students' laboratory book on the employment of the blowpipe in chemical and mineralogical analysis... A good many novelties in the way of apparatus and reagents are included... only after repeated trials have proved their utility.&quot;  The review in 1892 (v.65, p.237-238) of the second edition includes, &quot;This little work deserves the highest recommendation for its clearness, comprehensiveness, and portability...&quot; [However, I prefer my own reviews, which continues:]<br />  Includes a brief historical sketch of blowpipe analysis, Ross' aluminum plate support (more available now than a century ago!), and a great diagram of an easily homemade self-acting blower.  Chapters include Apparatus and Reagents; Operations of Blowpipe Analysis (includes open tube tests, closed tube tests, tests on charcoal, on aluminum, bead tests, by soda and other fluxes, flame colors, etc.), including a subchapter on Bunsen's flame reactions; Special Examination for Certain Elements, these arranged alphabetically; Systematic Examination; and Tables of Reactions of Elements, the first arranged by tests, the other by the elements.  Also well-organized index.<br />  Even today these methods retain a use for the amateur willing to try a few tests upon extra material before sending specimens off to be identified by overburdened professionals.  Often the common species may be identified by these classical methods; if more used such, then unusual species could be saved for professionals who may then study those with modern instruments.  Even so, a few simple tests on a sample have indicated the presence of unusual material, bringing this to the attention of professionals.  In any case, the conserving of these methods and art is the historical preservation of part of our mineralogical heritage, and such guides as Landauer not only help the amateur in practical determinative mineralogy, but also preserve the history of such.<br />  This is one of the best treatises on the subject and may be the only extensive one still in print.  Its reputation for its Clearness is well deserved.  It will prove fascinating to any lover of historical chemical mineralogy.  Both for this, and as a useful reference, it deserves a rating of 10.	1997-11-16

Also includes the standard fold-up Interference Color Chart, on quality glossy paper, and on its reverse a table of birefringence versus relief (difference in refractive index).<br />  The author retains consideration for students, including photos of such non-minerals as may confuse the tyro, such as textile fibers, bubbles, and grinding compound, all of which get into thin sections (petrographic slides).<br />  Excellently laid out and organized, it also contains a good Index.  This text was written for college students taking petrography and optical mineralogy, and has been kept, rather than sold, even by some students who never expect to use a petrographic microscope again.  College instructors take notice, as for a junior to senior level petrography course this text probably rates a 9 or a 10.  [DMM]	1997-11-16
US	53023166	R252LBVOL71N0X	0404146996	446968434	Introduction to the study of minerals	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Reprint of 1937 text, mainly great for its chemical section.	This is a reprint of the third editon of Austin Flint Rogers, originally published in 1937, and lately reprinted by AMS Press.  It has been described as a &quot;classic with an accurate chemistry section, including a section on microchemical analysis.&quot;<br />  This is a thick textbook:  40% of it is Part I, The Properties of Minerals, which includes crystallography, an introduction to optical mineralogy, physical properties, chemical properties (such as classical blowpipe tests and wet chemical methods).  Part II is Descriptions of Minerals, each category heading in boldface for easy reference, including crystal line diagrams (which may be more useful than photographs, which were not abundant in texts of that era).  Also includes, under each species name, the name of the species in German and in French.  Part III is the Occurrence, Association, and Origin of Minerals; a discussion of their role and settings in geology.<br />  This was probably written as a college text of the era, as it contains material usually included in college mineralogy texts of the era.  Although somewhat dated, this can be interesting, and for students interested in chemical aspects, useful.  It is very difficult to rate a book by numbers, as it is better in some aspects than others, but as I had to rate it (required), I chose a seven.	1997-11-16

This third edition (1993), believed to be the latest edition, is a tome of mostly mineral names, including outmoded names (giving modern equivalents) and varietal names (giving their definitions).	1997-11-16
US	53023166	R29MJ1ACB9YOE8	0395727782	21832787	A Field Guide To Rocks & Minerals, 5th edition	Books	5	60	65	N	N	A classic useful to beginners and experts alike.	This Field Guide has been, and still is, The classic and useful Field Guide.  Despite its title, this is mainly oriented toward minerals.  Well organized and interestingly written, this is one of the few mineralogy texts which is both readable for enjoyment, and useful to both the beginner and the expert.<br />  Part I includes an introduction on the philosophy and adjuncts of the collecting and study of minerals, briefly reviews geology and its rocks, discusses the physical properties of minerals (such as may be used to help distinguish the various species), introduces crystallography, a chemical classification of minerals written for the layman, and finally Tests, Techniques, and Tips, with many useful down-to-earth hints.<br />  Part II is Mineral Descriptions, each one with name, formula, crystal system, and visual aids in the plates which include both diagrams and photographs.  Several headings in each description are in boldface: Environment, Crystal description, Physical properties, Composition, Tests, Distinguishing characteristics, Occurrence, and Interesting Facts.<br />  Also includes glossary, bibliography, index.  Well organized and accurate, this little book has been used by some amateur mineralogists who, although using several more technical books during years of study, still find this one useful.  Although another well-known text is the most commonly used one for college mineralogy courses, I have recommended that students also get a copy of the Field Guide.  For the amateur exercising a bit of Emersonian self-reliance in the testing of his own specimens, this Field Guide is one of the very few remaining guides including good Tests (which have actually been tried before including them) under each species.  Appeals to collectors to first try a few tests on extra material before turning specimens over to others such as over-burdened professionals.  Also appeals to study some phase of the subject for ones' own edification and enjoyment, as one will getas much out of it as he or she puts into it.  This Field Guide shows you how.	1997-11-16

Originally published in German in 1985, this paperback is full of wonderful color photographs.  Many specimens are from Germany or from other parts of Europe, and anyone wanting to view such specimens, but cannot travel to a museum in Europe, is advised to get this book as it would be an easier trip.<br />  The text is non-technical, written for the layman with brief descriptions of the minerals, and is not to be used as an identification guide (as indeed some definitions are imprecise; e.g. the definition of a mineral), but is an interesting book and would make a fine coffee-table book for those interested in minerals (and in rocks, as half the book is devoted to rocks), with beautiful photographs.  It might also make an introduction to the subject for friends of mineralogists who enjoy the beauty of minerals.	1997-11-16
