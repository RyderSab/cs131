US	52770861	R3KFAIT4I4K6Y7	0312204094	184001758	Gain	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A moving, affecting novel	I remember reading, many years ago, a passage in which a writer- it might have been Paul Theroux- detailed a conversation with an African about a man who had been bitten by a snake. \\"Witchcraft\\", the African said knowingly, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.<br /><br />\\"But the man walking down the path- that wasn't witchcraft,\\" argued the European, and the African nodded. \\"And the snake coming down the path- that wasn't witchcraft either\\" the writer went on. The African agreed with this as well. \\"Then how could it be witchcraft?\\"<br /><br />\\"Ah,\\" said the African, \\"the fact the the man and the snake happened to be there at the exact same time- *that* was witchcraft!\\"<br /><br />Reading Richard Powers novels often puts me in mind of that story, and perhaps there is no better example than Gain. As is often the case in Powers' novels, there are two seemingly unconnected- or tenuously connected at best- threads, seperated by time. One story is that of an old-line American company- you could be forgiven for thinking Lever Brother or perhaps Proctor and Gamble- slowly making its way from humble beginnings to becoming a major industrial power, proceeding in fits and starts, and always thinking of the customer and the employees. In a somewhat different time frame, a divorced woman is living her life as she believes best for her and her children. And yet, with good intentions all along the way, something terrible happens that no one seems to be to blame for- and yet someone must be.<br /><br />This is one of Powers' most affecting books, I think, and one that will both move most readers and prompt them to examine many of their beliefs about justice and responsibility.	2005-10-10

What you actually get is six CDs, and a rather thin book with a few scales, chords, and some riffs. The CDs themselves have a lot of Andy Staman talking, and a fair amount of him playing, and illustrating points. Unlike a real lesson, of course, you don't get to see Statman playing, and while that's a drawback, it's assumed that anyone buying this packaged already has the basics down and knows how to hold a mandolin.<br /><br />On the first track, Statman explains what the course is about, the preperation the student needs (it's assumed you've completed one of the earlier bluegrass courses from Homespun), and the general stylistic direction, whcih is to say blues a la Ralph Stanley. This isn't quite what I was expecting- I was looking more for a Jethro Burns/Tiny Moore jazz instruction- but it eventually does touch on that.<br /><br />The narration tends to be rather meandering, and gives the impression that Statman isn't speaking from a script, but is speaking off the top of his head from a few notes. Some people can get away with that, but for a set retailing for fifty bucks you do expect something a little more polished- or at least more organized.<br /><br />And that takes up to my main criticism, which is that this isn't so much an organized plan of study as it is a collection of scales, riffs, chords and ideas that the listener is expected to use. It's not so much a collection of lessons as it is a seminar with Statman. The skilled player will find a number of useful things to expand his or her playing, but the beginner will find it difficult to place any of this in a useful context. The better the player, the more use this will be. Of course, the better the player, the more of this material they'll have picked up on their own.<br /><br />Is it worth it? Well, around here, a half-hour music lesson from a good teacher costs about half of what this book/CD package costs. So for the price of two personalized lessons, you get six useful lessons, and that's not too bad a deal.o for the price of two personalized lessons, you get six useful lessons, and that's not too bad a deal.	2005-10-07

William Trogdon- or \\"Least Heat Moon\\", to use his nom de plume, isn't at all like that. He can't seem to step aside and let the story tell itself.<br /><br />That's probably because there really isn't that much story here other than that which the author invents. We're given is a tale in which the author and \\"Pilotus\\" take a mystical trip across the US by water. The truth of the matter is that Trogdon was accompanied by seven different assistants who kept him company, drove the trailer he needed to move his boat from one waterway to another, and performed other assorted tasks as required.<br /><br />In collapsing all these people into one character, \\"Least Heat Moon\\" not only has to resort to terribly clumsy locutions to avoid being gender specific, as another reviewer has pointed out, he also trivializes the work done by this crew and at the same time and loses the opportunity to give these characters a life of their own in telling the story.<br /><br />Whether for reasons of ego, or a simple lack of vision, what we're left with is the author's internal monologue... and frankly, what's left isn't terribly interesting.	2005-09-01

And of all the modern-day authors I've read, few are more opinionated than Thomas Firth Jones.<br /><br />Jones doesn't mince words when giving his opinions of designers, materials, or other builders. He's very critical of the stitch-and-glue method, and of builders like Sam Devlin, who strongly favors it- although that didn't stop him from modifying one of Devlin's designs to fit his building style. He is very critical of Phil Bolger's popular small sailboats, though he counts Bolger as a friend, and is effusive in his compliments of Bolgers' powerboat designs.<br /><br />Jones didn't start building boats until he was 40, although he spent a lifetime as a woodworker, and he seems to be very much an autodidact who taught himself a good deal of what he knows about boatbuilding. He's not afraid to describe mistakes he made along the way, or to describe some of his designs as failures. In general, his opinions are backed by experience and experiment. There are exceptions, of course. His knowledge of kayaks, and of kayak paddles, is poor, which wouldn't bother me if he didn't make sweeping generalizations about the optimum paddle for a boat. And his opinions about economics are startlingly ignorant. He doesn't appear to have read much or spoken to many people with different views, and (for example) dismisses Phil Bolger's libertarianism in an almost condescending manner.<br /><br />But those few points aside, this book- and Jones' earlier book- are a treasure trove of ideas about design and construction, and a very useful addition to anyone's boatbuilding library.	2005-07-13

Most of the articles are dominated by a kind of gossipy tone about the people involved without ever actually touching on the science. For example, one of the longest pieces in the book is a review of the Intelligent Design debate from the New York Review of Books. It talks a lot about the politics and supposed motivations of the players, with a long discourse on Stephen J. Gould's atheistic approach to theology- but not once does the author touch on the scientific aspects of the debate. I assume the reader is expected to accept the anti-ID position simply as a consequence of being a Review reader.<br /><br />No doubt the selection of articles was highly influenced by the editor's particular tastes and skills. Natalie Angier is a skilled writer, and her New Yorker pieces are always well crafted, but when it comes to science she's a lightweight. You won't see an equation, or even a number in any of her pieces, and the same is true, for the most part, of the pieces selected for this anthology.<br /><br />As a collection of casual readings for the person with no scientific background at all, I'd give this volume a B; for the reader looking for some depth, some explanation of current issues in science- D.	2005-06-24

(I also have the Banjo Player's Fakebook, which has most of the same songs- though not all- in frailing and clawhammer styles.) Just about every classic old time song, and a lot of the popular Celtic songs can be found here- Shady Grove, Little Beggerman, Joe Clark, Sleepy Maggy, etc. If you're an ear player or tab player just starting out, this book is a great place to learn a lot of the tunes played by string bands.	2005-06-23

The response, of course, has been to bring in a third methodology. The real reason for the failures has been that traditional project managment as it is usually practiced is designed to fail. It encourages the creation of fictions that live a seperate existence form the actual project, with due dates dictated from above, and project schedules fudged to meet due dates rather than  actual resources. In my own organization, we had a typical example of what happens in traditional \\"waterfall\\" development: A massive project to replace our main administrative system was ticking towards a June delivery (according to the detailed MS Project charts) and then, 30 days prior to delivery, it was announced that the delivery date had been pushed back an entire year!<br /><br />This can't happen with Scrum. Scrum reflects what's really happening in a project, and it encourages incremental development- prioritizing requirements, and delivering them in their order of need, instead of trying to deliver a complete project with every single componant at a certain date. It's also one of the least onerous of methodologies. As a Scrum Master friend notes, \\"It's the simplest methodology you can implement that will actually deliver results\\".<br /><br />It does requrie some changes in how things are done in the traditional organizations. Scrum project managers don't assign tasks and track performance on each task; instead, they assign goals and the programmers report on progress and any difficulties they many encounter. There's a daily stand-up review to report on progress and roadblocks and monthly reviews to reprioritize and review changes in scope. The result is that the project continually is driven by the needs of the customer as they evolve, and not by arbitrary goals in the distant future.<br /><br />If I've piqued your interest in Scrum at all, get a copy of this book.

His politics are his own, not dictated by the fashions of the New York Review of Books, and his writing owes more to the great novelists like Zola and Tolstoy than it does to the postmodern icons whose work seems to by the standard for literary merit these day.<br /><br />And that's a pity, as few writers can compete with Wolfe when it comes to making important points about culture in a way that's so entertaining. Aphorisms seem to spill out of him like water from a tap. For instance, his reaction to the oft-heard threat that America is falling into some sort of opressive government: \\"Fascism is forever descending on America- but it always seems to land in Europe.\\"<br /><br />This book contains a number of Wolfe's observations of the cultural scene, going back to a brilliant parody of The New Yorker and New Yorker editor William Shawn that appeared in Esquire around thirty years ago. All are showpieces for Wolfe's brilliant writing style and incisive wit.<br /><br />My favorite? Hard to decide between \\"Roccoco Marxists\\" (a discussion of the literary Marxism that lives on in academic and cultural circles) and \\"My Three Stooges\\", which combines Wolfe's serious  call for a return to the naturalistic novel with a hysterically funny description of the attacks visited upon him by three of America's supposed literary lions.<br /><br />But really, it's impossible to pick out favorites; it's all very, very good. I enjoyed it so much I went out and found a few more used copies to give to friends whom I thought might appreciate it as well. If you like the sort of witty, thoughful writing that seems to have disappeared in the modern era, you might like it, too.	2005-06-02

Although it's not at all clear from the title or description, most of this book is about the cleaning and customization of chromatic harminicas- the fancy ones with the slide- and not the simple diatonic harps that most people play. Some of the information is useful to diatonioc players, but most is not.<br /><br />The chromatic info is useful, but of somewhat uneven quality and style. Tuning- one of the most useful mods a player can do- is covered in a very superficial manner. Some of the mods, like reshaping the internal channels in the comb, are discussed at length without a lot of explanation was to why one mught want to bother. And many mods are presented with only the barest oif details- certainly not enough to insure that the tyro doesn't desctroy an expensive harmonica while learning how.<br /><br />As one reviewer has noted, far more information is out there on the web awaiting only a quick Google search.

There's an awful lot of information sqeezed into this book- scales, chords, arpeggios, modes, theory. What's missing, in large part, is a narrative to tie it all together. The guitarist approaching this book swithout much pre-existing thoery knowledge might find him or herself lost in the details.<br /><br />Still, it's a fine collection of information that's still better organized than a lot of similar texts. Scales, modes and chords are presented in the \\"CAGED\\" system- a good way to organize knowledge- and simply following the text and practicing all the excercises will give the intermediate guitarist a lot of knowledge and technique to apply to further learning.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to the guitarist who's gotten comfortable  with playing rock or other styles, but who is looking to explain his or her matsery of the instrument- maybe with the thought towards playing Jazz, or perhaps progressive rock. This isn't for shredders looking to master playing exotic scales at neck breaking speeds, but for the guitarist looking for a command of melody and harmony.<br /><br />Despite the \\"Cookbook\\" title, this is not a collection of riffs that can be immediately applied to one's playing.

While many of his insights are useful, he seems to spend a lot of his time rediscovering the obvious. Most annoyingly, he can't seem to avoid coining new terms where perfectly good ones about.<br /><br />In this book, and on a recent interview promoting it, he repeatedly referred to how the world was becoming \\"flattened\\" by changes in technology. It was unclear what he specifically meant by that until one realized what he meant was that we are all in closer and quicker communication with one another, and Tom, there is a perfectly good metaphor that's been around longer than you- the world is shrinking.<br /><br />This book has a lot of similar insights, which is to say very few original ideas are to be found here. To his credit, Friedman is not the knee-jerk idealogue that so many of his colleagues (particularly at the New York Times) are, but that's not really enough to recommend this book. You'd be far better off reading Paul Johnson's highly opinionated, but far more original \\"Modern Times\\". You might find yourself arguing with much of what he has to say, but at least there'd be something to argue with.<br /><br />Footnote: For a really devistating- and entertaining- takedown of this book, you might try Googling for Matt Taibbi's review, in which he takes down Friedman metaphor by metaphor with the kind of ruthless, cruel, and hysterically funny critical prose not seen since the days of  Ambrose Bierce.	2005-05-04

Electric Universe is a pleasnt sort of romp thorugh the history of electricy and electromagnetic theory aimed squarely at the non-mathematical reader- there may be a few number in it, but you won't find any equations, even the simple E=IR. The concentration is instead on the personalities involved, and so you'll learn quite a bit about Samuel F.B. Morse' predjudices, Faraday's humble beginnings and the bitter feud between Watson-Watt and Lindemann.<br /><br />Author Bodanis does do a fairly good job of explaining, in thoroughly untechnical and intuitive language, some difficult physical phenomena. He manages to explain things like how distributed capacitance and inductance nearly did in the early transatlantic telegraph cables, and why metallic surfaces reflect  radio waves. That's certainly Bodanis' strongest suit.<br /><br />His weakest shows when he tries to put things in historical perspective. The overal narrative jumps around quite a lot, and it's very difficult for the reader to get a good sense of how individual events relate to one another. A lot of his attempts to place discoveries and technologies in historical perspective are fraugfht with errors. His section on silicon and transistors seems to imply that broadcasting was a post-war phenomenon made possible by solid state electronics- but of course radio had made its way into nearly every home well before World War II. Bodanis says the silicon technology made it possible for rock-and-roll combos, and electric guitars in particular, to equal the big bands in volume;  Solid state technology didn't make appreciable inroads into that arena until the 70s, at least twent years after the beginning of that genre, but the electric guitar had been popular since the 1930s, played by artists like Charlie Christian.<br /><br />Despite the various asynchronies and the occasionally annoing (to me) overly flip tone, I suspect this would be a very enjoyable book for the liberal artist with an interest in technology, or perhaps the middle school student with an interest in science.

It's not the usual \\"There I was at 20,000 feet..\\" memoir; this is a critical look at the global strategy and the local tactics of the Vietnam war told by someone who had a unique view from the cockpit.

Someone remarked not long ago that this books was destined to replace Steven Hawking's popular book on cosmology as the least read best-seller of all time, and anyone thumbing through even a few pages will rapidly come to that conclusion as well. Even though the author says that lay readers may skip the more technical sections, that's not really much or an option as the bulk of the book is complex, highly mathematicl, and difficult to follow, even for mathematicians and phsycicists.<br /><br />What Penrose is actually presenting is his own cosmological model, a theorectical framework he developed some decades ago, and one that has had remarkably little impact on the mainstream of theoretical physics. That is to say that no one other than Penrose is doing work on Penrose' model.<br /><br />It's hard to say, then, who this book is actually for. The non-mathematical reader has to take the bulk of Penrose' claims at face value, and even then it's hard to understand exactly what he's trying to say about the Universe, except in very general terms. He doesn't have the gift of an Alan Guth, or a Steven Hawking in constructing examples that illustrate points in an intuitive manner. The theoretical physicist who can make sense of the math might be interested in seeing what Penrose has been up to these last few decades, but that's a frighteningly small readership, and hardly one to justify the sales this book has been having.<br /><br />I suspect this is a lot like Steven Wolfram's \\"A New Kind of Science\\"; a book that was heavily hyped as containing the secrets of life, the universe and everything, but that turned out to be so dense that few could really understand what the author was trying to say. And Penrose' math is far more dense, specialized and unapproachable (to even the more mathmatically inclined of us) than anything Wolfram wrote.<br /><br />So unless you're a cosmologist curious about Penrose' theoretical framework, and looking for an all-in-one exposition of it, I'd give this book a pass.'d give this book a pass.	2005-03-11

Ergo the way mathematicians derive proofs, and by extension cognitive processes in general, must involve quantum processes, which for some reason he locates in the microtubles of neurons.<br /><br />Now I don't know much about quantum mechanics, but I do know a fair bit about cognition and neurophysiology, and I can safely say that Penrose is talking hooey from his first assertion on. He's made a very clumsy error in looking at mental processes that occur a level not open to concious introspection, and then assuming that because individuals cannot describe these processes, they are not describable using the language of ordinary logic.<br /><br />Everything else in the book derives from that simple error- an error I'd hope a second year Psych student wouldn't make. If he'd shared his manuscript with at least one psychologist, maybe this would have been pointed out to him, but again, perhaps that's just that conceit rearing its head again; how could a mere psychologist hope to understand the work of a briliant mathematician? ;-)<br /><br />If you're looking for a good book that will explain cognition once and for all, I don't think it's been written yet. Certainly not by Penrose.	2005-03-11

Malcom Gladwell, whose writing graces the pages of the New Yorker, is one such writer. He is such an excellent reporter and writes such beautiful prose that his readers seem to swallow even his most dubious and unjustified conclusions.<br /><br />Perhaps it's simply a consequence of his narrow education, but Gladwell manages to present the grossly obvious as if it were a brilliant insight while at the same time making inferences that are just this side of nonsensical. In this he reminds me of William Greider, whose \\"Secrets of the Temple\\", although the best history and description of the US Federal Reserve system ever written, in full of nonsensical conclusions, i.e., that inflation helps fuel economic recoveries. Tell that to Jimmy Carter.<br /><br />Gladwell's earlier book, \\"The Tipping Point\\", postulated that various phenomena take off once a critical point has been reached. Now put that way, it sounds profoundly obvious, and it is. Ice freezes at a critical temperature. Water boils at 100C. And so on. But Gladwell also accepts, at face value, a number of sociological theories that are without theoretical base, or even data, other than some casual observations. He doesn't, for example, touch on graph theory, which &lt;em>does&lt;/em> have some bearing on the spread of phenomena.<br /><br />In this book, his insight is that sometimes snap judgements are better than well-thought out ones. Again I'm reminded of Samuael Johnson's comment to a writer that \\"Your manuscript is both good and original. But the part that is good is not original, and the part that is original is not good.\\" There is a good deal of recent research that looks at the processing between pereception and cognitive awareness, but when Gladwell touches on this he gets both his anatomy and his function wrong. Much of his discussion- like the fact that voters often choose attractive political candidates regardless of their qualifications- has more  to do with factors other than the immediate perceptions he's trying to make a case for.<br /><br />I still often enjoy reading Gladwell in the New Yorker- his recent piece on drug prices was a fine bit of reporting, even if his conclusions were not of the same caliber.

McKay is really for the system developer who is charged with installing, configuring and extending Plone. It's not for content managers, and I find myself more in that category these days.<br /><br />I managed to familiarize myself with the basics by searching through the Plone.org website, but I still didn't really have a very good vision of the scope of Plone, how it could be used,  or how it should best be configured for my use. Even looking at sites that used Plone, had a lot of questions about how it could be used in my applications.<br /><br />Enter Cooper's book. This is an excellent all-encompassing guide that lays out what Plone is, what it can be made into, and how to go about creating usable Plone sites. Perfect for the absolute beginner, the web designer, content manager, or the developer looking for guidance on what can be done with Plone. Five minutes thumbing through it in a local shop convinced me I needed to add this one to my library.	2005-01-07

There are multiple layers, with Plone built on top of Zope and running (typically) under Apache. Finding the right level to install or modify a particular feature can be puzzling.<br /><br />McKay's book is still the definitive guide to the guts of Plone- what happens at what level, where to make changes, how to add functionality and so forth. For that, it's indespensible.<br /><br />What it is not, however, is an introduction to PLone, or a guide to creating and managing Plone content. The prospective reader of this book should have a good familiarity with the basics of Plone and creating and managing content. It wouldn't hurt to be familiar with object-oriented methodology, and at least one object-oriented language, be it C++, java, or whatever.<br /><br />For the experienced web developer, though, McKay's book is the ideal guide to the complexities of Plone.	2005-01-07

Books	2	0	0	N	N	Last gasp from a once brilliant comic	Thirty or forty years ago, George Carlin was one of the funniest comedians performing, with an offbeat styl and witty wordplay that stood out in a sea of old time comics telling mother-in-law jokes. His popularity waned in the 70s, but then he reinvented himself as a radical, dangerous comedian- sort of a PG-16 Lenny Bruce, testing the boundries but never quite going over the edge. His rap on the words you can't say on the radio made him a counter culture hero.<br /><br />But the culture changed, and what was once banned from the radio can now be found all over radio and cable TV. Carlin, like all radicals, suddenly discovered that the times had caught up with him, and he had become rather old fashioned. Once again he set out to reinvent himself in a darker, even more dangerous mode.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line, though, he forgot that the primary job of a comedian is to be funny. Or perhaps he just doesn't have any really good jokes left. Whatever the case, his last two books just haven't seemed very entertaining. This volume has plenty of heavy-handed attacks and taunts at religion, but they don't seem to be very funny, and attacking organized religion hasn't been considered radical or cutting edge since Martin Luther wrote his theses.<br /><br />What we're left with is a mix of pointless attacks combined with a little wordplay that simply doesn't come up to the standards of his early material. Entertaining for some, perhaps, but certainly not enough to make me read the entire thing.	2004-12-15

The public hearings were used to find scapegoats, and the book itself, being a product of two parties with equal say and a strong desire not to have their actual errors in print, is a selective collection of mea culpas, hand wringing, and a promise that everything will be better if we just make these few massive structutural changes.<br /><br />One only has to look as far back as the Challenger disaster panel to see how little actual good comes out of these projects. There were similar inquiries after Pearl Harbor, Watergate, the Tet offensive... the list goes on and on.

Or the boat that's motored out of the harbor, parked a mile off shore for use as a swimming and drinking patform, and then motored back in. Or the boat that can only bve sailed from one expensive blue water marina to another becuse of its deep draft.<br /><br />Brown likes small, shallow-draft boats that can be hauled up on a beach, or at a minimum, anchored near enough for the crew to wade in. He likes gunkholing- lazily exploring little inlets and estuaries where the big boats can't go. And most of all he likes the West Wight Potter, a 14' mini-cruiser that he and his young family sailed for many years. Brown has probably done more for that boat than all the advertising the company has done over the years.<br /><br />Now there are plenty of people who can buy a 31' boat and afford the slip fees without a second thought, and who don't mind paying someone else to do the maintenance. But there are a lot more people who'd like to sail, but who can't afford paying as much for a boat as they did for the last two family cars. If you're at all interested in sailing, but think you need a big boat with 4 berths, a head, and a galley to enjoy time on the water, read this book; it'll be a revelation.	2004-09-14

Have you ever read a book that was, well, pretty good- not great, but pretty good- only to have your willing suspension of disbelief ripped apart by one or mor ereally dumb things the author couldn't resist putting in?<br /><br />Yeah, it's a lot like that.<br /><br />This is a pretty good, and pretty imaginative store. It's not a particularly original one; the same story has been told any number of times by other writers, but Steele does a workmanlike job of stiching the various tales togetehr. Unfortunately where he gets original is where he sticks his foot in it.<br /><br />The story opens in a United States that's come under the control of a repressive dictatorship. Sort of like \\"It Can't Happen Here\\", or perhaps bits of the Ender saga, or number of other stories. And who has taken over the country? Libertarians. Yes, those opressive, dangerous Free-Marketeers. Hmm.<br /><br />So we ignore that and move on to the rocket shuttles, which are names the \\"George Wallace\\" and the \\"Jesse Helms\\", which are Steels's idea of heroes of the future repressive state. Except both of these former politicians ended up renouncing their former racist views in the later years, and Wallace in particular ended up embarking on a campaign to atone for his earlier sins. It gets worse- and dumber- but I won't mention how as to do so would be to telegraph a major plot development. Not that it really matters as Steele himself telegraphs it less than halfway through the book.<br /><br />Now it's not an awful book; far from it. There are a great many books far worse out there. It's a reasonably interesting story, and probably ideal for passing time in an airport lounge	2004-09-12

The public story- the heroism of the firefighters and police, the harmony on the site- dosn't quite hold up in Langewiesche's telling. We see internecine fighting, looting, distrust, and outright hostilkity between different groups competing for control of the site and for glory in the minds of the public.<br /><br />But we also see an extraordinary effort by almost all concerned, and an operation in which public and private organizations came together to do an amazing job of cleaning up the site in record time. We also see the City of New York rising to the challange, brushing off Federal attempts to control the site, knowing that the city has more experience as disaster recovery and cleanup in its numerous contractors and building officials than the whole of FEMA. City officials and contractors came together and mapped out strategies and divided up work without waiting for approval from higher up authorities.<br /><br />An excellent piece of reporting and interpreting. Highly recommended.	2004-09-09

As Roach notes, people often deal with uncomfortable things like the dead and dying with a sort of nervous laugh. This is na interesting book, no question about it, but far too much of it reads like a nervous laugh, the sound of Roach trying to avoid dealing with the emotions that accompany death and dying. Some sections, like the story of one man's crusade to sell the idea of chemical digestion to undertakers, read like one long attempt to find the limit's of the reader's tolerance for the unpleasant.<br /><br />In other sections, like that on the use of cadavers in research, the author can't seem to decided whether she wants to be informative or funny; too often, funny wins out at the expense of the story and the dignity of the subjects and the researchers.<br /><br />There's a good deal of intereresting information here, but too often the story is sacrificed in favor of the author's need to remind us that watching people working with dead bodies can be unpleasant for her. I wish Roach had been just a little less concerned with keeping up the ironic pose, and a little more concerned with putting together a smooth narrative.	2004-09-09

Much of the material on the Tizard comittee's work seems to have come from R. V. Jones' \\"Wizard War\\", along with a great many errors.<br /><br />Shachtman states that gun turrets on ships were covered with something called \\"plastic armor\\" \\"although it had no plastic in it\\". A quick review of Jones' book reveals that the plastic armor was called \\"plastic\\" becasue it was flexible, having been made from asphalt and a particualr granite with a strong resistence to crushing. And it was not used on gun turrets, but on merchants ships; the steel armor plate on gun turrets as far stornger than the plastic armor, which was developed to provide a cheap armor for the merchantmen.<br /><br />The narrative is spotty, and has the feel of having been stitched together from various sources in large chunks. Topics are introduced without being developed. Others are introduced with no context. Long technical descriptions of systems are introduced with no explanation for the reader. The material on the Atomic Bomb is particuarly disconnected, with bits and pieces of the narrative scattered through the book and no thread pulling them together.<br /><br />In short, a sloppy and rushed job.

Pretty cheap for a 500 page Vantage paperback in excellent condition, and that alone should have told me that there's a tremendous oversupply of these. And for a good reason, too: It's awful.<br /><br />The forward tells you, among other things, that you can skip the forward, the first 123 pages, and afterword, various footnotes, and so forth, and this is not a case of the author being overly modest. Well over half of this book is a collection of explanations, apologies, and just general attempts to be cute and ironic on the part of the author.<br /><br />What we are left with is an annoyingly self-concious and ironic novel, a form we were increasingly bombarded with in the late 20th century, and of which this book may well be the apotheosis. I suspect that this book is probably the single reason such books rapidly disappeared from the best seller lists following its appearance, and that is something I suppose we should thank Eggers for.	2004-08-09

Anyone who writes popular science or even science fiction has come into contact with these people, who will bombard you with letters, and if you're not careful, phone calls, documenting their suffering at the hands of these aliens and their confederates in the government.<br /><br /> They're a sad lot, for the most part, living lives domintaed by sadness and paranoia and blaming all their personal failings on the aliens who torment them. But they do serve a purpose; they're the prirmary market for a certain type of literature that caters to their beliefs.<br /><br /> Fouche has cleverly copied the form (and much of the content) of the popular &quot;Left Behind&quot; books, exchanging the Christian Revelation theology for a more paranoid alien theology. It's not God who is watching and will come to take away the believers; it's an alien, who's going to suck your brains out. Lovely.<br /><br /> Poorly written, and appealing mainly to those who are already prone to fantasy, this is not a particularly good choice for someone looking for an interesting Sci-FI read. I came across it in an indirect way, myself; a reviewer writing a defense of a particularly poorly written (and paranoic) political book recommended this as a similarly informative and revelatory volume; it appears he didn't realize it's a work of fiction. (Reading the reviews, a surpriising number of fans seem to make that mistake). You, the intelligent reader, will know better.	2004-07-20

Gould's thesis- really, the thesis of Harry Whittington and some of his contemporaries- was that the unique organisms found in the shale represented a multitude of dead ends; potential phyla of the Cambrian era that could have, but did not, evolve into modern organisms. Gould and his predecessors cited the many mysterious fauna of the shale, such as Hallucigenia, as evidence of this notion.<br /><br /> But as the flora and fauna of the Burgess Shale were further examined, it became clear that waht were thought to be uniqie species actually were related to many contemporary organisms. Hallucigenia, it turned out, was being looked at upside down, and was probably a relative of the modern velvet worm. And so as well for many other &quot;unique&quot; phyla.<br /><br /> Gould is no longer around to defend his veiws, but many still cling to the idea of the Cambrian as the time of great experimentation by nature, influenced, no doubt, by Gould. Amateurs are particularly prone to this sort of fallacious argument-by-authority. Nonetheless, few if any paleontologists still subscribe to this notion, and readers should be aware that it is possible to read and enjoy &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; without accepting all of Gould's ideas as presented.	2004-07-20

F. Schumaker Society would produce the best work to date on one of America's pioneering industrialists, but Kirkpatrick Sale is, first and foremost, and excellent historian. His first work of note, &quot;SDS&quot;, was a brilliantly detailed work, and although Sale's sympathies were clearly with the founding members of SDS, he never let that prevent him from telling all the truth as he saw it.<br />And so it is with &quot;The Fire of His Genius&quot;. Sale goes back to original documents to present the real Fulton, a rich and complex character, and to clear up a number of errors that have crept into the popular histories, such as the claim that Fulton's boat was named the &quot;Claremount&quot;. (It was in fact called the North River Boat, after the popular name for the stretch of the Hudson it operated on).<br />Sale goes into some detail on Fulton's finacing, his relationships with friends and backers (some real surprises here) and his various dealings with governments. The picture that emerges is of an egocentric, but talented entrepeneur, less engineer than salesman, who nonetheless was instrumental in creating the technology of riverboat navigation that was instrumental in opening up commerce and trade throughout the expanding United States in the Nineteenth Century. All in all, excellent history and entertaining reading.	2004-06-16

Kirkpatrick Sale is a first rate historian, but as an analyst of history he tends to be blinded by his own so-called &quot;Neo-Luddite&quot; leanings. He does correctly identify that the Luddite movement was not about machinery, per se, but rather about social tensions arising in Europe, and that attacking machinery was simply an easy target. But his misses much in his economic analysis.<br />Like many neo-luddites and &quot;left anarchists&quot;, Sale believes in small government, but his (and their) small government is not small in power; it has the power to compel decentralization and to resdistribute income. It is, like Chomsky's 1970s-variety anarchism, Socialism under a different rubric.<br />Sale believes that large corporations, large cities and any large scale human endevor must be artificial, created in order to exploit man and nature, which rather puts him at odds with the experiences documented through most of written history. He rejects the efficiencies people have traditionally found in both trade and scale, and prefers instead an enforced village. The are a good many inconsistencies in his rationale; he decries the large corproation, but wants to redistribute the wealth produced by such  entities.

I don't mean complex theories of motivation or conversion or what have you; I mean simple notions of learning that we teach freshman students.<br />Criminologists seem to be able to generate complex hypothesis at the drop of a hat, but precious few of them are willing to step back and say, as Athens did, that brutal criminals act that way because they've been taught to be brutal. And astoundingly enough, when Athens did bring some simple psychology into criminology, he was thought a dangerous radical.<br />Reading of Rhodes' ideas I was put in mind of the books of the John Douglas, who built up FBI's Criminal Profiling division- another man who caused a revolution in crimonology by applying simple, well-known principles of learning.<br />Rhodes' biography of Lonnie Athens is interesting for a number of reasons; first the story of the man himself, second, the revolution he brought to the study of criminal behavior- a revolution that still hasn't quite taken hold everywhere- and last as a picture of a how change comes (or doesn't come) in well-established areas of academic study. Strongly recommended.	2004-04-27

What he claims, in essence, is that a few well-placed and influential people can be the critial factor in social change. He attempts to prove this by working backwards, finding the &quot;early adopters&quot; and pointing to them as the critical factor in a new trend, movement or whatever.<br />Careful and thoughtful readers might ask themselves: If these early adopters are the important factor in new trends, shouldn't they be the critical factor in more than one new trend? And interestingly enough, they are not. And that is the flaw in the argument.<br />Looking at any movement you're going to find that *someone* had to be first, even if if the growth of the movement was totally random. The real critical factor in the growth of new trends is not the people who are influential, but rather the opposite- people who are very easily influenced. They're the ones who follwo every new trend, or buy every new consumer good. And this is something that social scientists- and Madison Avenue- have known for decades.	2004-04-12

It is, however, not reason enough to accept all of Clarke's statements as a straightforward telling of history. Clarke's telling is somewhat compromised by his biases, which seem to be motivated in large part by how he was treated during various administrations. Under George H.W. Bush Clarke was promoted from the State Department to a seat on the National Security Council, and under Clinton, he was elevated again, this time to be the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism. Under George W. Bush, Clarke  stayed in the same position, but was no longer given full Cabinet access- and that seems to have strongly influenced his opinions about those he served under.<br /><br />The picture Clarke paints of himself is one of a brilliant analyst and planner who, if only he had been listened to, would have wrapped up the war on terror in a jiffy. He's at the center of every critical decision, barking out orders and directing personnel- an odd role for someone who serves in an advisory position. Everyone in Clinton's administration is a wise statesman who respects his judgment and skill; every other member of other administrations is a political hack. He's upset when command and control of managing responses to the  9/11 attacks is transferred to the Vice President's office, as mandated by law, instead of remaining with him.<br /><br />This book has been widely attacked, on both political and substantive grounds. Many of the political criticisms have been refuted, but the substantive criticisms have held up, with a number of Clarke's claims being refuted not only by the official testimony before Congressional committees of others, but by Clarke's own testimony. Michael Scheuer, chair of the CIA's bin Laden task force, is attacked in this book on his handling of the search for bin Laden; Scheuer has replied, publicly, that he knew a good deal more than Clarke about this matter. Clarke has also claimed that the FBI was charged by the Bush administration with facilitating easy entry into this country by members of bin Laden's family, a claim the FBI denies.<br /><br />There is much that is of interest in this book, and it is, in many ways, a useful contribution to the record of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But it should be read with a very critical eye, and alongside other public histories from players in that campaign.Scheuer has replied, publicly, that he knew a good deal more than Clarke about this matter.

And yet, until reading this book, I never really had a good understanding of that community or the people in it.<br />Others note that this is by no means an encyclopedic or authoritative work on the Hasidic world and the people in it.

You've got to read it! It's great! And it has all kinds of geeky stuff about ships and whaling that you'd like.&quot; I made some excuses about it being archaic but she browbeat me into agreeing to check it out.<br />I found a number of editions at the local bookstore but this edition, with the Rockwell Kent illustrations, caught my eye, so that's the one I bought. As I was paying for it the clerk at ther register said &quot;That's my favorite book!&quot; Maybe my friend was on to something after all.<br />I started reading it that evening, and you know what? This *is* a great book. The language may be a bit flowerly and long winded for those raised on post-modern New Yorker short stories, but it's a very vivid language that makes characters and  scenes come alive. Melville's narration of both the external world of the shop and the internal world of the characters is compelling in a way that few if any modern authors can acheive.<br />Moby Dick is a classic for reasons that go beyond having been assigned as school reading since the beginning of time. If you never got beyond reading the Bartlett's Notes when Moby Dick was assigned to you in high school, this is as good a time as any to dive into the real thing.	2004-03-25

The story is set against the backdrop of baseball, but it reads more like the solving of a great scientific mystery.<br />Anyone growing up in America, whether or not they even watch baseball, knows the basic stats that ballplayers are judged by: Batting average, RBIs, ERA and so forth. You can't escape them. And these are the numbers that make or break careers. Want to improve your team? Sell that .280 hitter and bring in a .295 hitter. Get a pitcher with a lower ERA, an so on. This was the received wisdom. To everyone but players of &quot;Rotissiere Baseball&quot;, that is.<br />&quot;Rotissiere Baseball&quot; is a paper-and-pencil version of the game popular with thousands of fans who trade players and play games based on the roll of the dice and statistics that they've compiled- statististics very different from the ones commonly reported. The players- many of them mathematicians, actuaries and others with a mind for numbers. These stats- termed &quot;sabermetrics&quot;- were empirically derived and then validated againt actual player performance. And yet they were completely ignored by the people who could most benifit from them- the owners and managers of the major league teams.<br />With one exception: The A's Billy Beane. An ex-player himself, Billy didn't have the math skills of those who compiled the sabermetric model, but he did have an uncommon amount of intelligence, and knew a good thing when he saw it. He used the sabermetric model to identify undervalued and overvalued players, and quickly traded his way to a top performing team with a relatively small budget.<br />Now that wasn't the only reason for the A's success, and Beane's skill went beyond just his utilization of the model, but it's the central issue in this story. The book isn't just about the math, of course; the portraits of Beane and the players he selects are every bit as fascinating.

Brown is only the latest of a number of popular fiction writers who have mined the legends of the grail and Knights Templar for plot ideas. What distinguishes this book is the promise- never fully realized- of the revelation of a great secret (and great improprieties) hidden by the modern-day Roman Church. Perhaps part of the interest is rooted in the current scandals of a different nature involving the Church.<br />While Brown starts strongly enough- a murder in the Lourve, a hidden secrets, a visitng American academic suddenly caught up in a vast centuries-old conspiracy- the book soon becomes little more than a so-so detective novel with all the usual gambits and tricks. Yes, there's a fair bit of facinating grail lore mixed in, but it's been done better by others.<br />This is not a bad book; it's good vacation or airplane reading, and for the first half you'll find yourself caught up in the story and facinated by the bits of the legend that Brown doles out in drips and drabs. But then the plot sort of slows down and the suprises become fewer as the turns and twists become more obvious. The climax of the mystery is pretty unsatisfying, the characters are never fleshed out much, and by the end of the book you don't care much one way or another what becomes of them.<br />If you're looking for a really masterful, brilliantly written book built on the Templar legend, you can't do better than Umberto Eco's &quot;Focault's Pendulum&quot;. If you're interested in some more fanciful and full of conspiracies there's always the books of Robert Anton Wilson.	2003-12-23

Tolkien's Lord of the Rings	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Wonderful Parody	I came across my copy of &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot; in my high school days, in a small bookstore in Cambridge. I didn't get all the jokes back then, but I still found it one of the funniest things I'd ever read. It's not the most subtle parody; at times, it makes the Three Stooges seem restrained by comparison. With Hobbits- rather, Boggles- named Frito and Dildo, a rider named Arrowroot of Arrowshirt and a woodsman named Tom Benzadrine, there's not much room for subtlety. And yes, the drug humor is a bit dated. But it's still great fun.<br />Yes, some of the diehard Tolkein fans are offended. These are the same people who dress up like characters in the book and go see the movie every weekend, and who fill Blogs with lists of errors in the movie. But for the rest of us, who can appreciate a good hearted parody, it's a hoot and a half.	2003-12-16

Reading O-Zone brings to mind Huxley's Brave New World, both for the portrayal of the world in which it is set, and for the inevitible comparison with another noted novelist who wrote a single book set in a futuristic world.<br />I've noticed that Sci-Fi fans as a group don't much care for O-Zone, as it violates a lot of the accepted rules of the genre- as does Brave New World, for that matter, and Huxley has never been that popular with hard core SciFi readers either. Both books  use the future world as a setting to explore relationships between people, and to make certain plot developments possible, but neither gets into much detail regarding the technology.<br />Like Brave New World, O-Zone explores the alienation of modern man in this world of the future, and the consequant attraction to the primative and atavistic world that is found on the reservation (Huxley) or in the contaminated lands of the O-Zone. And in both books, some of the protagonists go in search of amusement and entertainment from the primatives, but find something disturbingly similar to themselves.<br />Despite the strong parallels, O-Zone owes nothing in the way of plot of development to Brave New World. The story is as original  as anything Theroux's written, the characters are fully developed and well motivated, and the story compelling.	2003-12-15

Those looking for the poison pen letter described in many reviews will be less satisfied, I think. Many readers seem to be looking for further evidence of Theroux the Misanthrope: One reviewer notes that Naipaul was probably &quot;his only friend&quot;, which is an odd assumption given the number of friends who pop up around the world in Theroux's travel books.<br />Most of this book is, as Theroux himself states, the story of a friendship, probably the most important one in Theroux's professional life. The end of the friendship, and Theroux's disappointment and anger, really occupies a very small part of the final chapter. And yes, I do think that final chapter could have benifitted by some editing out of some of Theroux's more bitter and critical judgements of Naipaul. Both are fine writers- certainly two of the finest of the modern era. Naipaul has, perhaps, somewhat greater ease and fluency with language, and Theroux the greater imagination and openess to other cultures. Both have produced classics as well as less-than-classic work.<br />In his more recent book on Africa, Theroux quotes Nadine Gordimer  as saying that the book is really about Theroux, and not Naipaul, and that it was good he wrote. Yes, it's a somewhat self-serving quote, but it's accurate. And there's something universal in the story, something that every reader has probably experienced. Reading it put me in mind of a number of past friendships- close ones- that seemed to end abruptly, and without good reason. Or so it seemed at the time.<br />Regardless, it's still excellent writing of the sort expected from Theroux, and still exemplifies the lessons Naipaul taught him, most importantly: Tell the truth.	2003-10-16

Many of the most critical seem to focus on a few details and miss the overall tenor of the piece.<br />As Theroux makes quite clear in this book, he loves the English seacoast, and he met many warm people along the way. At the same time, he unflinchingly relates every detail of his experience, every rude comment, every unpleasant encounter. As he notes, most travel writing is boring; we went to Egypt, we saw the pyramids, et cetera. What makes for interesting reading is the minutia, the detail that makes my trip different from your trip. My England is nothing like Theroux's, but then, I wasn't there for 17 years, I didn't tour the coast, and I am not Paul Theroux.<br />I recently re-read &quot;Kingdom&quot;, while thinking about a bicycle tracing some of the ground covered by Theroux, and what struck me was how much there was that Theroux truely liked about his trip, the things he saw, and the people he met. The more unpleasant encounters only served to make the pleasant ones more so.<br />&quot;Kingdom By The Sea&quot; is for me, at least, a thouroughly enjoyable tour, a look into the British and into Theroux, and as always, a terrific piece of writing by one of the modern masters.	2003-09-25

For someone like Alterman, the media is decidedly to the right of him, which of course has nothing to do with where the bulk of the country sees itself. Most of the network news anchors see themselves as absolutely unbiased and mainstream- despite polls that consistently show them to be overwhelmingly liberal Democrats. But that's just it; in their professional circles, being a liberal Democrat *is* being mainstream.<br /><br />When Dan Rather appeared at a Democratic Party fund raiser in April of 2001, one might have reasonably assumed that CBS would have required his resignation for such a blatantly partisan act by someone professing public neutrality. No such resignation occurred, because CBS and most of Rather's colleagues didn't see it as such a terrible thing. The only real offense against journalistic integrity they recognize is endorsing any action of an elected Republican.<br /><br />But most damning of all to Alterman's case is the 2010 revelation that author Alterman was one of the prime movers in \\"Journolist\\", a private email Listserv in which liberal writers and editors collaborated on how they would cover newsworthy events, deciding how to sabotage conservatives, boost their candidates, kill stories harmful to the election of Democrats and so forth. When the existence and contents of the list were disclosed, Alterman was, not surprisingly, fired from his job blogging on the conservative movement in the US. His reaction? He called the end of Journolist \\"yet another casualty of the toxic combination of conservative conspiracy mongering and mainstream media cowardice.\\"<br /><br />To Alterman, lying and distortion while posing as an impartial reporter is no sin. But exposing lies and conspiracies- something that I thought journalists did as a matter of course- well, to Alterman, that's an unforgivable sin.	2003-09-02

There's nothing terribly original in this, as Peterson himself worked with the military in World War II to develop spotter's guides based on the principles he developed.<br />All of which takes nothing away from the accomplishment of the authors. This &quot;Field Guide&quot; is a marvelous book for aircraft watchers of all ages. I bought my copy to give to a 9 year old who's currently fascinated by every flying machine that passes over his house, but I find it equally as interesting to thumb through. It's small enough to slip in a pocket and complete enough to identify most of the aircraft you're likely to encounter.<br />As other reviewers have noted, though, it's getting a bit out of date. The last revision was in 1992, and since then we've seen the introduction of a number of new airliners and a veritible explosion of new models in the General Aviation marketplace. You won't find the 777 here, or the new Cirrus or Eclipse. It would be nice to see a revised edition in the next few years.	2003-08-06

This is currently a very popular topic in the educational industry, as educators look for justification in the cognitive literature for the rather ad-hoc educational theories of the past 40 or 50 years. Most of this volume is devoted to a fairly low-level- let's say High School level- review of selected literature form the cognitive and neuropsychological literature of the last few decades, and as far as it goes, it's not bad. It's spotty, certainly, and musch of it is very old, but the lay reader will still find much of it interesting and informative.<br />But the final chapter- Conclusions- is a tremendous disappointment, at least for this reader. Half the conclusions offered are so simple, and so obvious, as to be laughable. The other half are either contradictory or simply unjustified.<br />Consider this gem: &quot;Transfer and wide application of learning are most likely to occur when learners acheive an organized and coherent understanding of the material; when the situations for transfer share the structure of the original learning; when subject matter has been mastered and practiced; when subject domains overlap and share cognitive elements; when instruction includes specific attention to underlying principles; and when instruction specifically emphasizes transfer.&quot;<br />Translated, that means that people can best use things they learn when they've learned them very well, that practice helps, and that it helps to learn something in a way similar to how you're going to use it.<br />Or this: &quot;The predominant indicator of expert status is the amount of time spent working and learning in a subject area to gain mastery of the content&quot; That's Edu-Speak for &quot;the best way to learn material is to practice it&quot;<br />The author then concludes with an attempt to justify  the &quot;new approaches to teaching&quot; that had their genesis in the ed school of the 60s and 70s in a way that in no way follows what was found in the last 230 pages:<br />&quot;Traditional education has tended to emphasize memorization and mastery of text. Research on the development of expertise, however, has shown that more than a set of general general problem solving skills or memory for an array of facts is necessary to acheive deep understanding...&quot;<br />Wait a minute. Didn't we just learn that people who learn things best are those who practice them?<br />The biggest problem with this book is that it, like so many education books, is written by people with a lot of time in schools of education, but little or no time in a classroom or a basic psychology lab. The authors misinteprret the findings of others, they ignire a few centuries of existing knowledge, and they tend to use an overly complex terminology that parodies the language of psychology. And they confuse the principles of basic learning with the techniques and strategies of more skilled practitioners. Sometimes the results are merely amusing, but often they have tragic consequences.<br />A perfect example is to be found in the great whole word vs. phonetics debate of the past twenty years. Some education researcher came across the interesting tidbit that skilled readers don't sound out words; they recognize whole words at a glance. This was seized on by the education community, and within a short time phonics were out, whole word was in, and reading acquisition skills plummeted. The educators, amazingly enough, missed the obvious: That the skills required for initial acquisition are very different from the strategies used later on. Even the best readers rely on phonological skills when they encounter new words. If all you learn is whole word, there's no way for you to learn on your own or to sound out new words. Despite the overwheling data in favor of phonetics, Ed schools still push the supposedly superior whole-word teaching method. (The tremendous commercial success of the &quot;Hooked on Phonics&quot; program should be evidence enough regarding which method works better.)<br />As anyone who has actually read the cognitive memory and learning literature of the past few decades will tell you, there are a number of facts regarding learning that are pretty much undisputable. One is that all learning is essentially unconcious. The brain tries to make patterns from repeated stimuli, and to associate these patterns with other patterns.  Another is that repeated presentation strengthens these associations. This is something that's been demonstrated down to the cellular level back in the 1960s (Hebb, et al)<br />What this means is that initial learning is all about repetition, and lots of it. The best way to learn to play clainet is to practice clarinet, and the best way to learn to perform multiplication is to practice the heck out of your multiplication tables. You can use all the audio-visual aids, enrichment activies and voyages of self-discovery you want, but the only way to acquire inital skills is through repetition. Somehow, this message still hasn't gotten through to the education schools.-word teaching method.

The first group approach it lke any other craft, something to be honed through work and study. The second group see it as a gift bestowed on them by chance and practiced through intuition, and this view tends to extend to other aspects of the world as well. Not having ever had to work or think to attain their lofty position, they tend to approach everything intuitively.<br />And so the people of Hollywood judge the word the way they judge each other- by appearance and other superficial measures. How else to explain Sean Penn presenting hiumself as an international diplomat- and the news media actually taking him seriously? JFK is still considered a saint in Hollywood, more for his boyish good looks than for anything else. Bill Clinton was a hero for his purported support of gays, even as he abandoned them when it came time to take a stand. Noam Chomsky is worshipped by people in show business who've never read a single book on economics or politics because he makes the right kind of overarching judgements.<br />Hirsen is a bit strident at times, but overall this is still a fun read- until you realize how much influence Hollywood has on the decisions people make. Then it's just a little tragic, too.	2003-07-31

Their accomplishments become greater, and their flaws fewer. It's sort of a writer's Stockholm Syndrome. And that is the one great flaw in what is otherwise an fairly interesting and detailed piece of historical writing. McCullough's John Adams is a man of so little ambition, and such overarching modesty that the reader wonders how he ever managed to hang out his shingle as a lawyer, let alone become the second President of the United States. Adams somehow manages to always be on the right side of an issue in this book, which of course results in men who may have disagreed with him, like Thomas Jefferson or Benjamin Franklin, being portrayed as morally corrupt or foolish.<br />This is not something that McCullough alone suffers from. Readers of Edmond Morgan's &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; or Joseph Ellis' &quot;American Sphinx&quot; will note similar prejudices on behalf of their subjects. But McCullough's treatment is probably the least balanced of the group. Even the most lauditory of recent biographies of Franklin note his flaws as well as his accomplishments- see especially Walter Issacson's recent book- and treatments of Jefferson in recent years have also focused on the complexity of the man.<br />I was also slightly put off by McCullough's elliptical prose style- if you've ever heard his narrations of historical public television shows you'll know what I'm referring to. It's a style that, while not as florid as that of the 18th Century men McCullough writes about, is still better suited to the spoken word than the written one.<br />&quot;John Adams&quot; is an interesting as well as entertaining book, and it does have more than a little historical minutia for the curious reader. But if you're looking for a more balanced perspective on John Adams and on the Adams family in general, I would recommend instead one Paul Nagels' many books, starting with &quot;Descent from Glory&quot;.ting with &quot;Descent from Glory&quot;.	2003-07-30

The're no real narrative structure here; some of the pieces are narratives, some more essays and some are just rememberances that sort of meander here and there.<br />They're very readable, although I do get a little annoyed at times by Lees' short, punchy newspaper style, with two and three word sentances and one-sentance paragraphs. It's a technique that is best used very sparingly. Lees does do a superb job of recreating conversations, showing that he has a marvelous ear for the rhythms and conventions of spoken English.<br />The unifying theme through all these pieces is Gene Lees' concern with the role race played in jazz, whether the early racism that kept Black jazz musicians out of the limelight, or the contemporary racism of people like Stanley Crouch who proclaim jazz to be Black music. What puts Lees' essays a cut above others who have written on this topic is that he goes beyond the simple enumerating of players and their opinions; he has a real musicologist's interest in the history of jazz and popular music.<br />One piece, an extended profile and interview Dominique d Lerma is devoted to breaking the stereotypes of the earliest jazz music. If you watched Ken Burns' history of jazz you could be forgiven for thinking that jazz came from ill-educated, poor Southern blacks. de Lerma emphasizes, for example, the role of conservatory-trained Black musicians who integrated the harmonies of the European composers they studied into the popular music of the times, and the role of the great Black music publisher W. C. Handy in popularizing this music.<br />The last essay is specifically devoted to Wynton Marsalis, a man with marvelous technique and shallow opinions, who refuses to admit that any white musician has contributed anything to jazz, thus bringing the debate full circle. Marsalis is a trumpter with a brilliant classical technique who unfortunately has been elevated in recent years to the position of being the modern savior of jazz by the efforts of Burns and Stanley Crouch despite his not having much of anything original since his early days as an up-and-comer with Art Blakey's band. Unfortunately he has come to be viewed as a major figure and authority in jazz by outsiders, despite being generally ignired as disparaged by most jazzers.<br />The real pity of attitudes like Marsalis' is that they lose sight of the fact that while Jazz certainly had its origins in Black musicians, it has always been as much an American music form as a Black form, and that today it is an international form that transcends boundries of either race or color. The greatest musicians have always ignored artificial boundries, and many of the great bands of the post WW-II always included musicians of all races. It takes nothing away from Ray Brown to say he was influenced by Scott LaFaro, or that Miles Davis was strongly influenced by his close association with Gil Evans. (Miles, responding to a comment by Marsalis that Miles was never Marsalis' idol, reportedly told him &quot;without me, you'd be all 'Flight of the Bumblebee'&quot;)<br />For that matter, in the end it becomes ridiculous to talk about race. Horace Silver, as Lees notes in one interview, Black, Native American, and Portuguese ancestors; his father spoke Portuguese. Does that make him a white musician? A Black one? A European? Charles Mingus had a similarly mixed ancestry. Does the fact the he was perhaps a quarter African make him less Black in the eyes of Marsalis, and thus less of a musician?<br />There's a lot in this book to think about long after you put it down.

And yet there are stories that need to be told. Goerges Perec, who lost both his childhood and his parents to the Nazis in World War II deals with this problem by telling two stories, one real, and one metaphorical.<br />The real story of his youth is told almost dispassionately, as if he cannot bear to bring up the emotions of that time- or perhaps it is an accurate telling of a childhood in which emotion was repressed as a way of surviving. The metaphorical tale of the nation of &quot;W&quot; is also told from a distant, and somehwhat dispassionate perspective; it is a cruel land, but the narrator speaks of it as a historian or an anthropolist might.<br />It is only when the two are read together (the chapters alternate) that the full effect is appreciated by the reader. The cruelties of &quot;W&quot; are in fact alternate tellings of the realities left out of the true narration. Through this, the true horror of Perec's childhood emerges.	2003-07-24

It's not particularly well organized, and there's no theory or explanation; what you get are a few basic licks, a library of chord shapes, and a few tunes rendered in tablature.<br />This is a good resource for the intermediate or advanced player familiar with the genre who just needs a leg up to get started, but it's not really quite basic enough for the beginner looking to emulate Django. Still, a motivated beginner with a good ear and a good library of Django Reinhardt recordings might find this to be just what he or she needs.	2003-07-24

But once they start looking throuugh these massive volumes the reaction is not enlightenment, but despair. What are all these chords for? Which ones do I have to know? And when do I actually use them?<br /><br />Luckily, though, there's Arnie Berle. This boook will guide anyone from the rank beginner through the intermediate guitarist through the maze of chords. Rather than the usual listings- &#34;here's every possible C shord in every position&#34;- Arnie starts out simply and builds on basics, showing you at every step how chords function, where they come from, and why you might want to use a particular form in a particular situation. More importantly, he shows you basic progressions, like the I-II-VIV, how to do substitutions on standard progressions, and how to choose the right chord voicings.<br /><br />The book starts with open chords, and then moves into the rocker's favorite, 6 string bar chords, with plenty of examples of common progressions. From there it's on to 4 and 5 string jazz voicings, along with copious examples, and simplified 3-string rhythm chords for the swing or big band guitarist. By the time you finish with this book- and you might take anywhere from a month to a year, depending on how you went at it-  you should be able to start with a simple lead sheet and make your own hip rhythym part.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to beginners inetrested in learning something beyond simple open chords- particularly those with a bit of jazz interest. I'd also recommend it to any intermediate-level guitarist who wants to go beyond the basic rock chords into something a little hipper. There's something here for most every player.	2003-07-24

I had some idea of how I should play, as well as a smattering of chords that were appropriate, but I didn't really understand how big band guitar was done. I was playing all sorts of 5 and 6 string chords, trying to squeeze in all the notes when I should have been playing 3 note chords and emphasizing the *rhythm* part of rhythm guitar.<br />This book, like others in the series, is written to be used with volume 54 of the Jamie Abersold play-along CDs and tapes, so you'll want to buy that as well. The book doesn't go into a tremendous amount of detail, and the musical examples are pretty harmonically simple (&quot;All Blues&quot;, &quot;Dolphin Dance&quot;, etc.) so after working through this book the beginner looking to expand his or her technique in big band guitar playing will want something with more depth and a little more theory. I'd recommend Charlton Johnson's &quot;Swing &amp; Big Band Guitar&quot; as a book for anyone from the advancing beginner to the strong intermediate looking to learn classic swing and rhythm style.	2003-07-24

Back in the 1950s- and well into the 60s- there wasn't much in the way of Jazz guitar literature for the beginner. You listened and copied, or you found a good teacher. Back then, Baker's book was a godsend to beginner. He actually had the hip chords they'd been hearing diagrammed out, and dozens of hip riffs and lines written out, too. It was a great place to start from, and many guitarists will tell you that this is the book that got them going. Even Pete Townsend says this is where he learned his chords from.  A lot of guitarists looking for a good jazz self-study course have looked at this book, and wondered if there was really much to be learned from few simple chord exercises and a few dozen riffs. Sure, there were a lot of good chords to be learned from it, but beyond that...?<br /><br />Actually, there is a tremendous amount of information to be found in this book, but only if you follow Mickey's directions. He doesn't give you a lot of why- just \\"do this until you have it down.\\" But if you do that, you'll find yourself internalizing a lot of important rules and skills that other teachers spell out. Those hokey sounding chord progressions that Mickey wants you to memorize and transpose to other keys are actually teaching you all the standard jazz substitutions. Mickey does spell out some of these rules in the second half of the book, but if you've done your homework you'll find that it's much easier to apply these rules to soloing if you've actually internalized them than if he had just told you that you could use a Lydian or Aeolian sub for a dominant chord in a 12 bar blues.<br /><br />The second half of this book is all about learning to solo, and a lot of non-readers have looked at it, and been put off by the lack of tab. But you don't need reading skills beyond that absolute minimum to use this book. Mickey has provided all the fingerings below the staff for each exercise. It may be a little unfamiliar at first, but by the time you finish this book- and it'll take a year to really do it right- you'll find that you have some pretty good reading skills, too.<br /><br />Even though it was written back in the 1950s, the riffs and chords Mickey teaches sound just as hip today. Some guitarists will quibble with some of Mickey's choices, or his chord names, but it's more a matter of opinion than a fault in the book. For example, a lot of contemporary guitarists would play something like Bm7-Bb7-Am7... rather than Mickey's straight descending m7ths (Bm7-Bbm7-Am7..) today, but that's something the student will learn just by listening to guitarists today.<br /><br />In short, if you know a few dozen chords, you can strum along, and have very basic music reading skills, and you're confused by all the different jazz guitar books out there- this is the one you should start with. If you follow Mickey's directions, practice every exercise until you've memorized it, and written out and practiced all the transpositions, too, by the time you finish the book you'll be able to comp and solo over most any jazz tune.<br /><br />[n.b.- this edition was edited and re-typeset from the original 1950s edition, and when they reset it they introduced a number of errors.

In terms of technical skill, this is about as sophisticated as disabling a car by stealing the battery. But at the time, when AT&amp;T was looked on as the rock Gibralter, it was shocking that a group of kids could manage to bring it down so easily.<br />Since then, both phone switch technology and the skills of hackers have increased, phone and computer technology has exploded in dozens of new wired and wireless services, and the Web has replaced the phone company as the target of many a youthful discordian. Given that, the tales of teenagers poking about in telephone switches and wide-open databases is pretty boring.<br />The real heart of the story of &quot;Masters&quot; isn't the technology, of course, but the sociology and the personalities of the teens involved. When this story first broke, the players were portrayed as young geniuses who had mastered an arcane technology and beaten the giant phone company at their own game. The truth is somewhat less impressive and less interesting. None of these kids were geniuses, although they were for the most part pretty bright. Most of their hacks involved diving in dumpsters for technical manuals or posing as AT&amp;T employees to gain access and information. What they were doing was as much con games as anything, and what they did with the information they gleaned wasn't terribly sophisticated or imaginative. Nor were they themselves particularly sophisticated in hiding their tracks- even after being charged with crimes they continued hacking away at other computer systems.<br />In the end, there really isn't much to tell. A few teens and post teens get prison sentences. And no one seems to have learned very much.	2003-07-24

Arnie begins by introducing you do basic scale forms, while simultanously present related arpeggios. That's something not many methods do, but it's something that a lot of jazz teachers think should be emphasized from the start. (Some, like Carol Kaye, don't even teach scales, going straight to arpeggions!) And every scale and arpeggio example is presented with excercises designed to let you hear how the examples sound in a real musical context. That's important.<br />As others have noted, the book is written in musical notation, not tablature, although there are also diagrams showing how scales and arpeggios lie on the fingerboard. Being able to read music is a necessity- but really, all you need to know is the basics: Names of notes on the staff, how key signatures work and so forth. You don't need to actually be able to read for guitar; Arnie teaches you that as he goes along. A sight reader would be able to progress a bit faster, of course. By the time the reader works his or her way through this book they should feel comfortable playing and improvising basic jazz lines in most any context.<br />Ideally I'd combine this book with Berle's &quot;Chords and Progressions for Jazz and Popular Guitar&quot; (and a good listening library of jazz records). Together, these two books contain all the aspiring jazz guitarist would need to get started.	2003-07-24

It's not. What it is, in fact, is a pretty good introduction to writing CGIs with Perl for someone who has some basic knowledge of Perl and HTTP, but who has never done any CGI programming. And that's just the position I was in when I bought it.<br />The first third of the book is introductory in nature, with an introduction to how forms and CGI scripts work, some discussion of parsing forms in other languages, and some simple examples. The bulk of the book contains more complex examples of tasks like writing questionaires, interfacing with relational databases, maintaining state, graphics and so forth. I did glean a lot of useful information there.<br />The biggest problem with this book is a problem that's really common to all book on Internet programming: Standards are changing so fast that a year old book is likely to contain chapter upon chapter illustrating obsolete techniques and libraries. In &quot;CGI Programming&quot; there are a lot of examples using Perl modules that haven't really caught on, while some of the newer modules (obviously) aren't meantioned. Another problem is that the book is kind of scattershot in the attention it gives different topics.<br />Still, I think this is one of the better books for someone with basic Perl skills looking to get started with CGIs. There's enough detail here to start writing CGIs, and enough information out there on the web to go on learning.	2003-07-23

Jensen has an ear for language and a wonderful talent for creating vivid, memorable and very unusual characters- like the hirsuite, red-headed twins who may be the saviors of British fertility. Stylisticly, &quot;Ark Baby&quot; reminds me more than a little of some of my favorite English authors with a sense of dark, comic irony; both Kingsley Amis and some of the later Aldous Huxley come to mind. Think Amis' &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; meets Huxley's &quot;After Many a Summer Dies the Swan&quot;.<br />Jensen manages to develop two different plot threads, one contempory and one 19th Century, and then brings them together for a great finish that, while not entirely unexpected, still has a few twists and turns. I was a bit reminded of Thomas Powers, who often uses this technique to great effect. But unlike Powers, who often revelas sublte and unexpected connections between his plot threads, Jensen brings hers together in a massive collision, with great comic effect.<br />All in a all, a terrifically enjoyable and original book.	2003-07-23

What is pleasantly surprising is how very good he is at it. &quot;The Confessions of Mycroft Holmes&quot; is a very well written and witty novel, with well drawn characters that may at times be a bit extreme, but are never cartoons.<br />Theroux's writing style owes nothing to his father's; I'm reminded more of a number of excellent British writers- the sort of comic irony one might find in David Lodge comes to mind, and there's a bit of the darker irony found in early Kingsley Amis. But the Theroux family does figure strongly in the book nonetheless. The protagonist's younger brother is an exaggerated version of the author's brother, and the father is an exaggerated- perhaps even parodied- version of Paul Theroux, right down to his eccentric hobby of beekeeping. The setting is Cape Cod, where the elder Theroux grew up and the author, like the protagonist, spent part of his childhood.<br />As for the story itself: It's intruiging enough to keep your attention to the very end, and the resolution ties together the threads in a way that's satisfying without being either entirely unexpected or too simple. A few threads are left unresolved, but then, that's how life often is.<br />This is Marcel Theroux's second novel, and he seems well on his way to being just as prolific as his father, and in time, just as skilled. I'm looking forward to reading his next book.	2003-07-18

His writing is so exellent, his reporting so good, that he can find the story worth telling in just about any subject. McPhee has, for many year, defined great non-fiction writing, and indeed it's hard to read other fine writers like Tracy Kidder without seeing the mark of McPhee in their style.<br />I have a shelf in one of my larger bookcase that contains nothing but McPhee- books on geography, the Swiss Army, the Merchant Marine, Alaska, the headmaster of a private school.. and yes, oranges. And every one is an absolutely riveting read, whatever the topic. &quot;Founding Fish&quot; is no exception. As he does in many of his books, McPhee deftly mixes history, contemporary reporting, profiles and personal narrative in a way that's both seamless and endlessly fascinating.<br />If you haven't read McPhee, and you enjoy great reporting, you owe it to yourself to buy this volume- or, for that matter, any book by McPhee.	2003-07-16

All the new boats that have appeared on the market since the first edition have been included, and plenty of solid information from Ralph's invaluable Folding Kayak Newsletter has been integrated into the new edition.<br />If you have the slightest interest in folding kayaks, you certainly owe it to yourself to buy a copy of this book. And if you already own the first edition, you should absolutely get this one as well, for all the new material Ralph has included. It's still the bible of the sport.	2003-06-30

I've been reading reviews of GEB for years, and the most fascinating thing about them, aprt from the near-uniform enthusiasm of the readers, is that almost none of the enthusiatic readers have any idea of what the book is actually about! The typical reader seesm to think of GEB as a jouyous romp through any number of fascinating bits of logic, math and science without any idea as to what Hofstader's actually doing.<br />Yes, it's about Goedel, and recursion, and &quot;strange loops&quot;, and linguistics Bach and ants and all that- but only trivially. The bulk of the book is taken up with what amounts to a very entertaining tutorial that sets the reader up for the real thesis of the book. What Hofstadter has attempted in GEB is nothing less than a concise, bottom-up theory of mind. You can read it as a theory of AI, or a theory of human intelligence, but either way he's telling you how to construct an intelligent entity.<br />True, he doesn't really have a theory of *how* a self-aware being should arise from his metaphorical anthill, but then, neither does anyone else. But he does have a very good story as to how intelligence does arise in such conditions.<br />If you've read this book before without understanding what his aim was, read it again, with that notion in mind. And if you haven't read it, and you're the sort of person who enjoys mathematic and scientific amusements of any sort, well, read it and discover how much fun a speculative theory can be.	2003-06-30

He's at once friendly and informative, chummy without being condescending. The problem is that Bill Bryson is a bit sloppy when it comes to facts. I read an interview with Bryson in New Scientist not long after this book was published in which he admitted that he really didn't understand a lot of what all these scientists were telling him, and unfortunately that's all too clear in reading this book. As a consequence Bryson gives you a good deal of infomation peppered with some really horrid misunderstandings and errors. I'm reminded in \\"A Short History\\" of Bryson's book on language, in which he either repeats or invents any number of terribly inaccurate folk etymologies- another very readable but terribly inaccurate tome.(For instance, he thinks the term \\"hackers\\" comes from some metaphorical reference to hacking through code. It's actually from the MIT Model Railroad Club, many of whose members went on to become some of the first computer hobbyists.)<br /><br />Bryson is great fun to read on personalities (although the accuracy of some of his characterizations is suspect) and he does have an ear for fascinating trivia, but science takes a back seat to all of this. All too often we get the beginning of an explanation that trails off into a \\"and anyways it's all very complicated but it's it just fascinating\\" sort of gee-whiz summary. One suspect that we've just reached the point where Bryson has either lost the thread of understanding or perhaps just decided that he doesn't care to understand something any further. And sometimes he just gets the facts terribly wrong. He says Betelgeuse is \\"fifty thousand light years away\\"- the actual number is 430. He says the last noble gas was discovered in 1962- but Radon was actually discovered in 1899. He says ambergris is from giant squids- it's from whales. He repeats the long-disproven claim that the glass in old windows is thicker at the bottom because it flows over time (it's thicker because window glass was once spun into a disk, whereas today it's flowed onto a flat surface). And that's just a small sample.<br /><br />As enjoyable as Bryson can be to read, I only wish he'd had his manuscript vetted by editors with a solid science background, or better yet, collaboraated with a scientist on the writing. As it is, I can't really recommend this book. The reader interested in how science has shaped the world would do far better to read James Burke's justly well-regarded [[ASIN:0743299558 Connections]], of any of George Johnson's excellent works, like [[ASIN:067974021X Fire in the Mind: Science, Faith, and the Search for Order]] or [[ASIN:140003423X The Ten Most Beautiful Experiments]].thicker because window glass was once spun into a disk, whereas today it's flowed onto a flat surface).

I don't particularly agree with a lot of what Dick Morris has written, but I will say this: Right or wrong, he's written a specific critique that rises above the partisanship that characterizes most political books. He's more than willing to point out flaws wherever he may find them.<br />One thing I do find myself in strong agreement with is the specific criticism of the foreign policy of the 1990s. Morris suggests it was the neglect of foreign policy policy and the pattern of accomodating and paying off tyrants that allowed for the rise of terror in the 21st century, and I can't say I find many flaws in his argument.	2003-06-30

There are a number of good method books for the jazz bassist these days- I must own at least a dozen! But Hungerford's book is one of the best. Unlike some authors, Hungerford doesn't start you off playing root-root-root or root-fifth-root-fifth. He assumes you want to learn to play real bass lines, and that's exactly what he gives you. From the beginning he has the reader building lines with roots, 3rds, 5th, 6ths and 7ths; from there, he moves quickly into I-IVs, rhythm changes and II-V-Is in various keys. There's also an accompanying CD to provide rhythmic and harmonic accomaniment to the excercises.<br />The second half of the book takes the reader through a number of standard tunes, some with bass lines written out and some provided for the reader to write their own lines using the guidelines given. There's a lot of information packed into less than 100 pages here, and a diligent player will find all they need for a solid progam of jazz education.	2003-05-12

You've written a few CGI pages, and maybe even some mod_perl module.<br />But you can't figure out the point of some of those perl features. Blind hashes? What are they for? And that 'bless' instruction? And typeglobs- huh? Maybe you're puzzled by that odd syntax some of the CPAN modules use- $class-&gt;export($var)? What's that all about?<br />Relax. You've just stumbled into the world of object-oriented perl programming. And it's not as hard as you may think. Conway does a wonderful job of explaining how OOP works. His examples are perfectly transparant, and perfectly obvious. And he shows how OOP construction can be summed up neatly in three simple rules.<br />There aren't a lot of prerequisites needed to make good use of this book. If you've got a basic familiarity with perl, and some basic experiece with programming, you're ready to dive in.

It covers the basics- things like 'use &quot;$_&quot; implcitly whenever possible, but don't refer to it explicitly if you don't have to'. There's a good description of slurp mode. And it covers those neat little tricks, like using:<br />($a,$b)[$a&lt;$b]<br />to return the greater of two scalars.<br />It's not a book for the absolute beginner.

Bradsher gets most of the history right, and then completely misses the obvious, even when it's staring him in the face.<br />What created the SUV was not an auto company conspiracy, or an oil company conspiracy. It was, quite simply the Clean Air Act, and specifically, the CAFE fuel standards. By making large cars illegal,  the government forced consumers into the next best alternative: Trucks. And the auto makers responded by building luxury trucks. Now some want to see laws restricting trucks and SUVs, which will do doubt create yet another huge unintended consequence.<br />Anyone looking at recent sales figures will see that the sales of trucks have been tapering off along with SUVs as people start looking for something a little smaller and a little more car like. In time, fashions and tastes will shift, and by the time laws are enacted to limit trucks, they'll probably only affect those businesses that actually need them.	2003-04-22

And as with his calculus book, he is wading into waters where far more skilled writers have gone before.<br />Like the calculus book, this will appeal to readers who don't really want to be troubled by detail, and who like the idea of reading about science without actually having to deal with the difficult notions. It may also appeal to those who don't mind the confusing narrative and who will appreciate the scattershot style and pointless asides.<br />I have to admit I couldn't finish this book.

For this, he has been condemned in the scientific press and accused of everything from ignorance to being a tool of the corporations- everything short of being an agent of the devil himself. Even New Scientist magazine, in comdemning his treatment, found it necessary to repeatedly characterize him as being &quot;out of his depth&quot;, and his ideas as &quot;illogical&quot; and &quot;by no means a towering intellect&quot;.<br />All of which, I think, goes a long way in supporting the notion that far too much environmental policy is more about politics than science. Looking closely at data and trying to replicate findings- something that I was taught is at the heart of scientific inquiry- is not allowed.<br />Now I think of myself as an environmentalist. I drive a tiny 4-cylinder car, I don't run two-stroke motors, I don't dump solvents into the drain, I compoost my lawn, I use organic methiods on my lawn and garden, I superinsulated my house and I try to use manual power wherever possible. I'm excited about the coming of hybrid vehicles in the mass market.<br />But like Lomborg, I am skeptical of much of the data and theory being presented in support of policy. I know, for example, that a good part of global temperature fluctuation- though I would not claim all of it- it due to long-period, well documented, solar oscillations. And while research on the correlation has been published in Sweden, you won't find any scientist publishing that data in this country. It's just too risky to a career to go up against the politically popular models.<br />Some of Lomborg's statements that have upset his opponants the most have been those that point out what should be obvious truths- like the fact that while pesticides may have toxic effects, they can also save lives by providing cheaper food.<br />Remember the Alar flap? It wasn't that long ago that Hollywood mustered dozens of stars to protest against a relatively harmless antifungal agent called Alar. You may also remember those touching ads with Meryl Streep talking about this terrible poison.<br />Well, Alar was only found to be carcinogenic when administered in a dose large enough to kill 90% of those receiving it- the equivalent of eating pounds of it, when only a few milligrams or micrograms were applied to apples.

As such, it's more of a disconnected set of essays than a narrative; the discussion of significant bass players is somewhat spotty, and doesn't go into great detail on their music and style in the way that (for example&quot; Todd Coolman's &quot;The Bass Tradition&quot; does. But it's still both entertaining and educational. The chapters, being mostly self-contained, can be read at random as the reader's interest dictates.<br />The first section of the book is primarily short snapshots of significant bassists, each being composed of a short biography accompanied by brief musical examples. The latter section- almost an appendix- consists of longer examples of styles and techniques. It's not really a method book, but it does offer some insight into styles and harmonic and rhythmic concepts for the beginning or intermediate jazz bassists. The accompanying CD helps illustrate the musical examples for those whose reading and playing technique  are at a more basic stage.<br />All in all, a very entertaining and useful book for jazz bassists of all abilities, and an excellent choice for bedside reading.	2003-01-17

Here's a book I really wish I had back in high school jazz band. I used to go nuts with the charts back then, trying to figure out voicings and get all the notes in where the arranger wrote &quot;Gb#11b13+&quot; or some such, when that's really the last think you should be trying to do in a big band. But a good rhythm guitarist- as I leanred later- should concentrate on *rhythm*, using minimal voicings to develop a line that really acts like a counterpoint to the bass line. Forget all the altered tones; stick with 3rds and 7ths and develop good movement- think Freddie Greene in Count Basie's band. Simple voicings and solid rhythm.<br />This book is all about learning those voicings, learning where to subsctitute, and where to simplify to build interesting, musical  lines. At that it succeeds marvelously. It doesn't assume any prior skill or knowledge, other than being generally familair with the guitar, knowing some basic chords and having some familiarity with the swing style. All chords are diagrammed as well as written out, so it's easy and convenient for both reader and non-reader alilke.<br />It's is a great tool for the beginning swing guitarist, the high school or college jazz band player looking for  an organized way to approach rhythm guitar, or an experienced guitarist looking to expand his or her style. I've given it four stars instead of five as I think it could be organized a little bit better, and with a little more explanation in parts, but overall it's an excellent book.	2002-11-13

Quite an accomplishment.<br />I would strongly recommend this book to both the casual reader with an interest in mind and anatomy, and the serious student looking towards a career in psychology, medicine or neuroanatomy.	2002-11-05

Back in the 1960s Erlich was a mainstay of the popular media- sort of a Carl Sagan of population- and a regular guest on the Tonight Show, where he spelled out his apocalyptic vision.<br />&quot;The Population Bomb&quot; was a polemic that dictated a series of prescriptions for society, without which we were racing headlong to all sorts of disasters, notable shrtages of all strategic resources, massive starvation involving millions of people, food riots that destroyed governments and the downfall of western society as we knew it. This was prophisized to happen in the 1970s, and as most of us recall, none of it happened. He went on to predict that *billions* would die of starvation in the 1980s. Erlich also made a famous bet with economist Julian Simon,in which Simon challanged Erlich to pick 5 commodities that he felt would go up in price because of shortages. Erlich took the bet, and all five fell drastically in price.<br />In fact, nothing that Erlich prophasized ever happened. Erlich's predictions had little to do with science and much do do with ad-hoc justifications for his political prescriptions. Now Erlich has jumped onto the nature/nurture bandwagon, which has  generated a lot of renewed interest in recent years owing to some major breakthroughs in the understanding of, and potential control over, the genetic makeup of humans. And once again, Erlich sees a lot of reasons we should follow his particular social agenda.<br />There's nothing particularly new or original in the discussion of nature and nurture in this book, which isn't surprising as Erlich  has never done any research in this area. Most of the book is a fairly elementary rehash of the last twenty years of genetic research. Unfortunately it's not a terribly good one. His understanding of issues like human language is elementary at best.  Even as science continues to discover just how much of our nature and our biology is, in fact, genetically determined, Erlich's position is that the contribution of genes to behavior is all but trivial, and that leads into the real intent of this book, which is to say his  prescription for how society should be run. And not surprisingly, it's the same prescription he was making in the 1960s.<br />Erlich's problem is that he wants to be a social philosopher. He longs to dictate his notion of an ideal society- but he doesn't have any good social arguments. Instead he gives us specious arguments rooted in questionable scientific interpretations. The result is a poor introduction to either the nature-nurture debate or social philosophy.f issues like human language is elementary at best.

One problems with documenting any computer language or system today is that things evolve so quickly it's almost impossible to keep a book current without yearly revisions. Java is certainly a prime example; many of the books out (including this one)  still concentrate on applets, and that's not the direction where Java is going. Applets have all but disappeared in favor of servlets, as many have realized the truth of the characterization of Java as the &quot;write once, debug everywhere&quot; language.<br />Another problem with many Java books is a lack of graded examples that introduce features of the language in a logical manner. Many start with a few small programs and a &quot;don't worry about this feature, we'll explain it later&quot; attitude, and then give you 200 pages of language details with no examples. Others develop one huge application and use that as the basis of the text. Fine, perhaps,  if you're developing a similar application, but otherwise only confusing.<br />This text does suffer a bit from a paucity of examples. It's not a bad book, especially at the reduced price, and it's a decent introduction to Java. But there are better ones for not much more.<br />My current favorite in a purely introductory text is Herbert Schildt's &quot;Java 2: A Beginner's guide&quot;. Plenty of examples to illustrate every feature as it's introduced, and a logical progression to the text that's based on learning the language, not a particular application.	2002-09-27

I bought this book on a whim in the middle of a major house remodeling project as a bit of a diversion from all the technical reading I was doing on architecture, construction practices and so forth. Like a lot of guys (and some girls) I'm a bit of a tool freak, so what could be better recreational reading?<br />Well, lots of things, actually. Staten's book isn't bad, and it does have a lot of interesting stories and a few out of the ordinary facts. But it has a few problems, too, like the huge number of factual errors. There are, for example, retellings of long refuted myths, like the one about Thomas Crapper and toilets. And then there are some downright dangerous misstatement, such as the claim that a string-type weed whacker won't cut flesh.<br />What I found most offputting was Staten's writing style. He likes the short. Punchy. Sentence.<br />And lots of new paragraphs.<br />Of one sentence.<br />Each.<br />After a while this really starts to grate, as does Staten's idea of what passes for a joke. But taken in small doses- and with a large grain of salt- the book is still reasonably entertaining. Keep it in your toolbox for reading on breaks, or atop the porceline convenience.	2002-09-17

About that &quot;Right Side of the Brain&quot; business: When this book first came out, the popular literature was clogged with popular works on left brain/right brain functionality, and most of it was total garbage- including most of the stuff on brain laterality in this volume.<br />No matter, though; this is still a very good tutor for the beginning artist. The exercises work whether or not you think you're  drawing on the right side of your brain. They're very well thought out, practical excercises that work.<br />What they *aren't* is original.<br />There's a very influential book that was first published in 1941 (and is still in print) entitled &quot;The Natural Way to Draw&quot;, by Kimon Nicolaides. Nicolaides was a very influential artist who taught at New York's Aret Students League, and Edwards' book is essentially Nicolaides with a lot of nonsense about &quot;R-mode&quot; and &quot;L-mode&quot; that serves no practical didactic purpose.<br />Edwards' book is still a good tutor for the novice, but Nicolaides is just as good- and in some ways, better.	2002-09-17

Simondl is good, but without a teacher to guide you, it's incomplete. It doesn doesn't say too much about technique, and much of it is devoted to things that are important in the classical realm but less so in jazz. After all, how often does the typical jazz bassist find him or herself playing baroque ornaments in 3/2 time in the key of C sharp?<br />I discovered &quot;Intonation Plus&quot; by accident and ordered it on pure speculation. I'm supremely happy I did. Here's a book that teaches exactly what one needs to know about classical technique. Rather than pages and pages of repetitious excercises, you get a few very specific exercises designed to instill specific skills. In a short time I found myself much more comfortable moving quickly into higher positions and playing two octave scales accurately.<br />There's a volume 2 as well, though it's not in print- it's available only as an E-book.

There are a number of scales and arpeggios worked out in various keys, but no discussion of how to apply these to build bass lines.<br />There's a lack of discussion of upright bass technique- just a few pictures- and not much more for electric. I wouldn't recommend it at all for the beginner attempting to teach him orherself.  For the advancing student looking for scales and arpeggios, I'd recommend Rufus Reid's &quot;The Evolving Bassist&quot;. The price is the same, but there's much more useful material there.	2002-08-15

Modern photographers have reacted to digital photography in one of two ways. Some have embraced the new medium, happy to be delivered from the mess and isolation of the darkroom. But a few have gone in the opposite direction, emphasizing the craft itself, and seeking to rediscover  the charm and the attraction of the earliest photographs.<br />Alan Greene is one such reverse pioneer. He has looked at the oldest photographs produced by nearly forgotten techniques like cyanotype and albumin, and seen something missing from modern, technically perfect photographs. Part of it is the attraction and charm that comes from the hand-made nature of a primitive, less-than technically perfect image. But another aspect is the more direct participation of the photographer in every aspect of the creation of the image.<br />Greene finds his artistic satisfaction in not only the darkroom processes, but in the direct creation of the tools and materials of photography. In this he is not unlike those artists who grind their own colors or make their own paper. Whether the finished product is better because of it is not the issue; I think Greene would instead take the position of Walter Benjamin as outlined in his famous essay, &quot;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot;. Benjamin argued that it was the hand of the artist that brought what Benjamin called the &quot;aura&quot; or the essence of the art.<br />To accomplish this end Greene has carefully reconstructed the historical processes and tools of the 19th century photography. Wooden cameras, simple and compound lenses, and traditional chemestries are carefully detailed in a way that a careful craftsman could duplicate. The results, judging from the samples Greene shows in his book, are worth the effort./>To accomplish this end Greene has carefully reconstructed the historical processes and tools of the 19th century photography.

It's an absolutely first-rate example of a readable, engaging and accurate historical portrait.<br />Most American readers have grown up with the story of Franklin the inventor and statesman, but the image we generally have of him is that aging gentleman on the fifty dollar bill coupled with a few notions about lightning and fireplaces and printing presses. But Franklin was so much more than that. He was a social philosopher who counted amoung his friends learned men such as David Hume and Bernard Mandeville. He was a natural philosopher whose observations on electricity led to his becoming the first American elected a fellow of the Royal Society. He was a lover of all things British, proud to be a Briton, and yet compelled in the end to take a stand with his Colonial brethern. And above all, he was a thoroughly modern man, who challanged many of the orthdoxies of the day and was nonetheless able to do so in a manner that made few enemies.<br />Brands' biography is both marvelous entertainment and a wonderful and detailed biography of a man who, perhaps more than any other single man, defined what it meant to be an American.	2002-07-09

Heinlein took a common theme in boy's literature- the young boy who goes off to sea- and moved it into the twenty-first century in this tale of a boy who finds himself suddenly swept off Earth and involved in a struggle far away in space.<br />I recently gave a copy to my nine year old nephew who is similarly entranced with the book; not bad for a sci-fi epic written over fifty years ago.

He starts the reader off with basic scales and simple patterns for playing over changes. From there it's on through more complex scales and  patterns and finally, soloing, illustrated with a number of transcribed classics.<br />Combine this book with the Simandl book for basic technique (and a good library of jazz albums), and you have just about everything needed to guide the beginning bass player through the intermediate stage. For a player who already had a basic classical technique, this book alone is just about all that's needed to learn to play jazz.	2002-06-17

(This has been a popular form since the days of Socrates himself, and in fact a structurally similar, and absolutely dreadful, book about a dialogue between a man and a gorilla was a best seller in recent years.) Adams' wise old man presents the narroator with a number of arguments that baffle the narrator but (unfortunately for Adams) are mostly old arguments with simple refutations.<br />Every imaginative college student who has completed a course in intro philosophy has found his or her thoughts turned to the sort of fantasy Adams has written, but not everyone has enough pull with a publisher to actually get it published. Adams has written an imaginative little story that would have been much better if he's read a few more philosphy books and realized that his novel ideas weren't terribly novel at all.<br />Still, those who have never read any philosophy might find this book interesting and perhaps it might even stimulate them to read a bit deeper than the author has. If you found this book interesting- or \\"life changing\\", as some have intimated, I suggest you move on to a few more challanging books by authors whose education in philosophy goes beyond a few intro classes. As good a  place as any to start might be Alain de Boton's \\"The Consolations of Philosophy\\".	2002-05-20

In this boo he set out to reveal what he though were a number of failings in the US Defense establishment, concentrating on policy, strategy, and weapons procurement. In many areas he does an excellent job. In others, he does less well. Some of this is because of facts that weren't available to Fallows at the time he wrote this book. Some is because of the evolution of technologies, like RPVs, that weren't part of the equation when Fallows did his research. But in other cases, it's because he only told one side of the story. And in some cases, he simply got the facts of the matter wrong. There's a body of experimental evidence from studies done in the last decade that suggests people give highest credence to the first source of information they encounter. We're all prone to do this, and in many cases I think Falows found a source that seemed to do a good job of explaining the facts to him (like Paul Nitze) and he stopped there.<br /><br />Let's start with the matter of the M-16. This is a story that's been told many times, and Fallows gets it mostly correct. But there's a lot missing from his telling. He credits Rep. Ichord with being the one man who set in motion the hearings that led to the revision of the M-16, but in point of fact, there are a number of men who were much more important. The first is then-Lt. Michael Chervenak, who bucked the chain of command, and sent the letters to several Congressmen and newspapers that really set everything in motion. Anoteher was Chervenak's CO, Richard Culver, a career officer who backed Chervenak up when the brass came gunning for him. (This is well documented in [[ASIN:0141020636 Gun: The AK-47 and the Evolution of War]], a book largely about the AK-47, but which also comers the complete M-16 history and much of the history of 20th Century small arms.) Fallows also misses the single biggest flaw of the M-16- the chamber and barrel were not chromed, and that led to severe corrosion in the humid climate of Vietnam. It was this flaw, which was due to the Pentagon's refusal to spend a few extra dollars for the plating that Colt recommended, that was responsible for most of the jams and failures experienced by soldiers in the field.<br /><br />Fallows also seems, in his dissertation on the M16, to have fallen under the spell of those who at the time were arguing for massed fire over aimed fire as being the role of the infantryman. This was a fashionable view for a time, but as wiser men observed, why put sights on rifles if you're not supposed to aim them. Today, aimed fire is the standard, and marksmanship is heavily emphasized in both the Marine Corps and the Army. Today's M-16 derivatives have advanced reflex sights that are designed to make the most out of the rifleman's skill. Fallows closes this section with a shot at those who, in the 70s, were arguing again for a higher-power cartridge. But today, while the 5.56 NATO remains the standard cartridge for the infantry rifleman, more higher power rifles have entered the basic armory of the soldier, particularly for sniping use. The 7.62 NATO cartridge is in common use, along with the 300 WIn. Magnum and the .338 Lapua.<br /><br />There are also several specific technical errors in the M-16 section. For instance, in describing why the change from IMR powder to Ball powder caused problems, he says that because the Ball powder was a slower burning powder, it was still burning \\"when the gas port opened\\". Fine, except the gas port does not open and close. It is not a valve, as Fallows thinks, but merely the hole at the muzzle end of the barrel where gas is vented off to drive the bolt rearward.<br /><br />In the section on armor, he ridicules the TOW missile, stating that the need to keep a sight on the target while the missile is en route is a fatal flaw, and that \\"the TOW has never really been tested in combat\\"- but the TOW has been extremely successful in combat from Vietnam- a decade before Fallows wrote his book- through Desert Storm. He similarly ridicules the JTIDS Command Network and the \\"wild expansion of C3I\\",  complaining that such complex, integrated networks \\"are useless when they don't work and may be harmful when they do.\\" But as anyone who has followed the development of integrated battlefield C3I systems can tell you, such systems, which integrate data from soldiers, radar, aerial surveillance and intel, are the backbone of the modern battlefield, and an area where the US military has a tremendous advantage over its dies. Fallows quotes a number of stories whose point is that in the end, war is attrition, and a surplus of material can overcome the best weapons. That is true, to a point, and it was Stalin's philosophy; he is supposed to have said, during WWII, that \\"quantity has a quality all its own.\\"  But countless engagements and campaigns have proven the effectiveness of superior weapons over numbers, including the aforementioned Gulf War. Fallows' M1 Abrams story contains some real howlers, the biggest one being his criticism of the M1's smoothbore main gun, since \\"everyone knows\\" that rifled barrels are more accurate than smoothbores. Everyone except M1 gunners, that is, who made countless one-shot kills at ranges of one to two miles during the Gulf War. The M256A1 120 mm smoothbore gun found on the M1 Abrams, firing the M829A3 APFSDS round, has demonstrated itself capable of one-shot kills of tanks at 4,000 meters (2.4 miles) in actual battle conditions.<br /><br />Despite the numerous errors, omissions and faulty inferences, there is still a surprising amount of good information in this book. Fallows' description of the genesis of the F-16 is particularly good, as is his writing on procurement, the evolution of the modern fighter jet and his chapter on careerism in the military. It's still useful for that material, and more. But there are other books on those topics. If you do happen on a copy of this book, I still recommend reading it, and there's a lot of historical information that can be gleaned from it.

Viz:<br />Let's start with a fission weapon of Hiroshima size- about 20Kt. 85% of the<br />energy partition is blast and heat; 10% is delayed radiation from fissile<br />products (the lighter parts of the split nucleii) and 5% is prompt radiation<br />in the form of neutrons and gamma rays.<br />Now, let's say we build a small fusion weapon with a minimal fission trigger<br />resulting in a 1Kt fission-fusion weapon. The energy partition in the fusion<br />reaction is 80% prompt radiation and 20% blast and heat. The result is that<br />this 1Kt weapon has only 0.05 the blast and heat effect of the straight<br />fission, but equivalent prompt radiation effects. (Recall that most weapons<br />in the US arsenal are fission-fusion-fission weapons, which is sort of<br />a way to build a much bigger fission weapon than would otherwise be possible<br />or practical). We also have no delayed radiation from the fusion reaction,<br />although there is still some from the fission trigger- though much less from<br />the straight 20Kt fission weapon.<br />Cohen's ultimate plan was to develop a pure fusion weapon with no fission<br />trigger. That's been mentioned in this list before, and I have absolutely<br />no idea if such a weapon was ever developed. However, if it *could* be develope<br />it would then be possible to build a 0.01Kt pure fusion device with half the<br />prompt radiation of the 20Kt fusion device, no delayed radiation, and blast<br />and heat effects of a large (20,000lb) conventional bomb. Such a device could<br />be detonated at a comparitively low altitude and result in no blast effects<br />reaching the ground while still having a kill effect from prompt radiation<br />over a radius of over 1000 yards.<br />From this Cohen conceived his idea of a defense plan for Europe and Germany<br />in particular: Small, cheap bomb shelters for the populace with nothing more<br />than a few feet of earth as a radiation shield. The warning sounds, people<br />go the the shelters, the N-weapon missiles are launched, and a few hours<br />later the battle is over.<br />Cohen's book covers not only the brief technical outline of the bomb (summerized<br />above) but also the long political history. The USSR steadily portrayed the enhanced radition weapon as inhumane, even as<br />they were developing their own. It was often called a bomb that &quot;killed people while leaving real estate intact&quot;, but as Cohen pointed out, the people were advancing troops of the Red Army,<br />and the real estate was the cities and homes of Western Europe.<br />Highly recommended.om this Cohen conceived his idea of a defense plan for Europe and Germany<br />in particular: Small, cheap bomb shelters for the populace with nothing more<br />than a few feet of earth as a radiation shield.

Diamond's thesis is that it was geographical determinsm that was responsible for the dominance of the West, and that cultural factors- individualism, capitalism and so forth- were only of short term importance. He does have interesting answers for every exception to his rule, and indeed, he builds a compelling story to explain every culture and its success or failure.<br />But none of these stories are universals, and none is applicable outside the region in question. Each of Diamond's stories amounts to what we might call a &quot;Just So&quot; story, after Kipling's tales by the same name. Building backwards from the outcome, Diamond can justify the special cases in each instance, but his universals all fail. For instance, China didn't attain the power of the west because it unified too soon, and this happend becasue it lacked the peninsulas and mountain ranges that isolated communities in Europe, allowing for greater development of different experiments in societal structure. This &quot;Island Geography&quot; approach is attractive and it echos a common thread in biodiversity, but it certainly doesn't explain the dominance of North America today- or the difference between North and South America.<br />One problem with Diamond's thesis is that he's inconsistent. Sometimes it's the shortage of natural resources that triggers advancement of technology, and sometimes that same shortage impairs it. Having a lot of natural resources is similarly invoked to explain success and failure.<br />A more serious problem is that Diamond has taken one brief snapshot in time- the world since the 19th Century- and has taken that as the absolute measure of the success or failure of a society and a geography. But a few centuries ago it was the world oif the East that was predominant, and indeed the Arabic world came very close to completely conquering Europe. Had Diamond written his book then, he would have needed to justify his thesis  with arguments opposite from those he presents. And perhaps in another few centuries things will have reversed once more. Given all that, I find his argument singularly unconvincingAnd perhaps in another few centuries things will have reversed once more.

Imagine, if you will, a book nearly 800 pages long that holds you spellbound from the first pagethrough the last. Impossible. And \\"A Soldier of the Great War\\" is such a book. The story is simple. An old man tells the story of his life to a much younger man as they walk the road from Rome to Monte Prato. But what an amazing life. The old man, Alexander Giuliani, has been a horseman, a scholar, a soldier, a prisoner, a gardner, and much more. And what amazingly vivid prose. The book explodes with descriptions like Giuliani's description of Rome to a young Nicolo, as they gaze upon it from the hills outside the city:<br /><br /> \\"Rome still looks like catacombs of fire, and will remain this shattered and amber color throughout the night, although as morning comes the whiter lights will leave the field more and more to the strings of amber streetlights. But the moon, as it moves, has already run through a number of scenes. First is was a farmer's fire, almost dead in the night, ruby red. Then it ripened through a thousand shades of orange, amber and yellow. As it gets lighter it sheds its mass, until somewhere between cream and pearl, halfway to its apogee, it will seem like a burst of smoke that wants to run away on the wind.\\"<br /><br />And that's just taken from a page I opened at random. This is such rich text, so overpowering, that I could only read it in short sections. Yet I was continually comnpelled to pick it up again, and again.

He has a talk show, an organization, a magazine and writes books, all dedicated to separating the wheat from the chaff in human belief. Or so he claims.<br />This book, like his magazine and his show, shows Shermer at his best (witty, reasonably well read and clever) and at his worst (narrow minded, inflexible and ignorant of philosophical stances beyond his own). Like the Positivists of the early part of the last century, Shermer believes he has an infallible metric that enables him to distinguish meaning from meninglessness, and he applies it ruthlessly. He's at his best when picking the easy targets, like research into ESP, remote viewing and so forth. But he uses these examples as a springboard to justify more questionable criticisms of areas like SETI, which, while still very much in the speculative column, aren't by any reasonable researcher's definition bad science.<br />Unfortunately Shermer is unwilling or unable to admit there are vast gaps in his knowledge and that not all truths are easily sorted into one bin or another. He seems unable to understand that sicentific truth is a product of the paradigm of a time. Thus (for example) he rejects Freud completely, without understanding how Freud's theories were a product of his era, or how they helped change the way in which we talk about the mind. (After all, we know now that Newton's laws are only simplified approximations of the actual processes, but we don't decry him as [untruthful]!) Shermer lumps together the purely fantastic with the merely questionable or speculative; all things either pass Shermer's standard or they don't, period.<br />Skepticism is an important trait of the good researcher, but for Shermer it's a religion in itself, perhaps because his ego is so tied up in what he sees and the absolute truth of his assertions.  As a result, what begins as an interesting review of well-known [untruths] and delusions ends up being merely a demonstration of the limits of Shermer's knowledge.lusions ends up being merely a demonstration of the limits of Shermer's knowledge.	2001-08-22

At the beginning of the 20th century, our technology was based mostly on materials harvested and refined from nature. Milled lumber, iron, copper, and alloys of common metals. Fabrics were all derived from plans and animals with very little processing.<br />Early in the past century a revoution started to develop in materials technology, as scientists and engineers began to experiment with creating molecules and structures not found in naturally occuring materials. At the molecular lever, chemists created long-chain polymers that had some of the characteristics of natural materials, but greatly improved resistence to wear and temperature. At the macroscopic level, materials were combined into composites like plywood and epoxy reinforced fiberglass. New structures unseen in nature, like matrixes of carbon and boron fibers embedded in metals, became possible. By the end of the century, it was possible to start moving around individual atoms to create entirely new materials with designer properties.<br />Ball's narrative covers both the history of materials science, and the future and its possibilities. He's particularly good at the historical story, and at drawing parallels betwene natural and artifial structures. As in Ball's other popular works on science, &quot;Made to Measure&quot; is approachable without being trivial, and rigorous in its attention to detail without becoming numbingly pedantic. This is a book that would serve admiribly as either an introduction for the educated reader or a supplimentary text in an introductory materials engineer course.	2001-08-16

Some merely evoke a mood, or a feeling.<br />The title story- &quot;Break it Down&quot;- is a man's internal monologue, reflecting on (at first) the cost of a relationship, as he tries to make sense of it, and eventually its meaning to him, and how it affected him. It is a startling honest and accurate- to this reader, at least- portrayal of the thoughts and feelings that accompany a relationship, and that mark its end. It is also a stralingly accurate portrayal of (and, one would have to assume, understanding of) a man's internal monologue given that it's being told by a woman. Or perhaps men and women are more alike in this regard than most of us suspect.<br />Regardless, it's a brilliant story, and by itself justifies purchase of this book.

Where do the chemicals that make up life come from? Where, for that matter, does life come from? Is the chemestry of life inevitible- or is it purely accidental? Or is it, as many would still hold, the sign of an intellignet designer?<br />A good many authors have taken a shot at illuminating these questions in the popular press, with varying degrees of success. Too often the author falls into the trap of proferring metaphor in place of explanaition, and finally settling for a bit of hocus-pocus handwaving- &quot;and then something magical happens, and life arises&quot;.<br />Johnson's book is different. He manages, without recourse to excessively complex mathematics, chemestry or biology, to clearly elucidate the big questions as well as the various theoretical approaches that have been taken to answer them. And the way he does so is as entertaining as it is educational.<br />Johnson's stories all begin in Santa Fe, where three very different entities serve to illustrate many of the principles he discusses. One is the landscape of Santa Fe itself, the rocky outcroppings that serve not only as an illustration of geography, but also as metaphor for the notion of a &quot;fitness landscape&quot; and as the home of the Pueblo Peoples of New Mexico.<br />The second entity is the peoples of the Pueblo themseves. Through the evolution of their culture and their biology, Johnsom explore change in a population as it interacts with its environment, including other populations. Last is the newest entity in the area, the Santa Fe Institute, where, for something over a decade, scientists have been meeting to study and debate issues of complexity and the emergence of form and content.<br />Johnson manages, in only a little over 300 pages, to explore essential questions in the notion of structure in the universe, from the most elemental levels of quantum physics all the way through the emergence of intelligence without trivializing any of it. Whether discussing the philisophical implications of quantum thoery or the problems of explanation in Darwinism, Johnson presents the central issues- not some dumbed down version- and yet does do in a way that never talks down to the reader. Certainly one of thoe most outstanding popular science books of the year, and one that would be an excellent introduction to the universal nature of the questions involved for some specialists, too.ions in the notion of structure in the universe, from the most elemental levels of quantum physics all the way through the emergence of intelligence without trivializing any of it.

If only half of what Thomas divulges in this book is true, it's a blockbuster. And I would speculate that perhaps half has the ring of truth- but which half? Probably just the well-documented parts used to give a veneer of truth to the fabricated bits.  Amid all the stories of the deceptions and intelligence games played by the world's secret services, it's tempting to suspect that Thomas is being played as much as any of the other dupes he tells of. Did Khomeni order the assassination of John Paul? Did the Mossad kill Robert Maxwell? Who knows?<br />The tales Thomas tells are often very critical of the Mossad, yet running through the book is the implication that the Mossad is the only competant intelligence organization on the planet, and that all other intelligence organizations are staffed with bumbling fools.<br />The book seesm to give the impression is that Thomas' principle source of information is one or more retired or discharged Mossad officers who have both a pride in the organization as well as an axe or two to grind, but the reader begins to doubt that at least halfway through the book. Many of the stories just don't add up. Some, like the story of Gerald Bull, are absolutely at odds with versions told by well-established sources and thoroughly documented. The Bull story in particular reads like a sloppy farbication by someone who hasn't done a lot of research.<br /> Most of it is completely unverifiable, and a great deal of it strikes me as completely fabricated. And maybe, just maybe, the book is a piece of disinformation itself, designed to mislead and confuse. Who knows? File it on your bookshelves somewhere midway between Le Carre and Fleming.	2001-06-27

Bourdain has written a book that is scattered, disorganized, jumps back and forth between biography and detached commentary One moment Bourdain is telling you about some terrible prank he and his sous-chef played on a waiter, and the next he's telling you how to make excellent stock reductions. Huge sections seem to be missing from the narrative, too; Bourdain sort of teases you with a lot of unanswered questions.  And yet, he still manages to be informative, compelling and downright entertaining. It's that kind of book.<br />Two sections of the book have gotten the most press: One, which first appeared as a short piece in the New York Times, is a sort of insider's tell-all of the secrets of restaurants, like why you should never order fish on Monday, or eggs benedict anytime. The other is a short chapter on how to cook like a professional chef. Both alone are worth the price of the book, and the section on how to outfit a kitchen will save the aspiring home chef hundreds, or thousands of dollars, while embarassing the over-the-top kicthen junkies with their $900 knife sets and racks of solid copper pans.<br />If you're the sort of person for whom food is more than fuel- the sort who would consider skipping a rent payment to buy truffles, if the occasion arose- you not only want this book- you need this book.	2001-06-02

He was talking about notions like the  &quot;mind of nature&quot; even before James Lovelock codified his Gaia Hypothesis. It's very tempting to look back at Bateson's writing and see him as a very forward thinker.<br />The problem is that he was a very sloppy thinker. One reviewer spoke of him in the context of the postmoderns, and that's a very apt comparison. Like the postmoderns, Bateson's essays and arguments didn't come so much from obervation and evidence as they did from a certain cleverness, an ability to draw a complex and compelling picture without much reference to the known world. He throws out a lot of string statements about the world, but he never quite quite gives you any justification.<br />Consider this quote:<br />&quot;The individual mind is immanent but not only in the body. It is immanent also in pathways and messages outside the body; and there is a larger mind of which the individual mind is only a sub-system. This larger mind is comparable to God and in the total interconnected social systems and planetary ecology.&quot;<br />That's an interesting notion, but hardly a new one. It's the core thesis of Hobbes' &quot;Leviathon&quot;, dressed it up in contemporary language with contemporary allusion. A number of current theorists and philosophers hold similar notions, but as part of a larger and hopefully self-consistant framework that Bateson lacks.<br />&quot;An interesting intermediate between the iconic coding of animals and the verbal coding of human speech can be recognized in human dreaming and human myth.&quot; (p. 421) Cleverly put, and possibly true, but he has no evidence for making this statement. It's completely hypothetical, and very much ad-hoc.<br />Bateson's followers tend to have an almost religious fervor- and yet you'll find few if any citations of his work in the serious works of others. There just wasn't much there other than glib notions without any sort of attempt at building an integrated thoery from which these notions might arise.<br />Bateson is still worth reading, both for historical reasons and for his clever ways of expressing some of these ideas. But he's not quite the genius his fans would have us believe.tions without any sort of attempt at building an integrated thoery from which these notions might arise.<br />Bateson is still worth reading, both for historical reasons and for his clever ways of expressing some of these ideas.

Atkinson has managed to tell a story that is both complete and detailed. He tells the story of the war from the perspective of the individual soldiers and airmen, the commanders, and the politicians. There's historical perspective, technical detail, explaination of stratgey and a ripping good narrative that pulls the reader along.<br />It's not perfect. Atkinson makes a few flubs along the way on matters of technical detail, but they're few and far between. He occasionally inserts an interior monolog that pushes the limit of reporting, but it's not done to excess. Overall an excellent example of how to write popular military history.	2001-04-04

Like thousands of other player, my banjo playing began with a borrowed Harmony 5 string banjo and the this little book.<br />And what a marvelous little book it was! In a few pages Pete introduced me to scores of styles, tunings and songs. I didn't even know there was more than one way to play a banjo, but by the time I worked my way through this book I could frail, I could play a bit of clawhammer, and I could even work my way through a slow and tortured version of Earl Scruggs' great &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot;. All the songs and techniques are presented in a simplfied tablature, and Pete's explainations and the illustrations are goods enough that I managed to develop a pretty good clawhammer stroke even though I'd never actually heard one played before.<br />It's amazing how much Pete squeezed into this tiny book. Besides instruction in playing, there are bits on the history of the banjo, choosing a banjo, installing a fifth-string capo, lengthening a banjo neck- in short, everything the total novice needs to get started and then some. I eventually progressed to other books- notably Art Rosenbaul's &quot;Old Time Mountain Banjo&quot; and &quot;Art of the Mountain Banjo&quot;, and of course Ken Perlman's many fine books on clawhammer style, but I always kept a copy of this little manual around, as much as a reminder of those early days as anything. What more can I say? It's a gem. I love this little book.	2001-04-02

There have been books written by insiders- indeed, a great many of the astronauts have written books of varying quality- but they tend to be narrow infocus, covering only a part of the program, or a single misison, like Lovell's &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. And there have been books by outsiders, but even the best of them- like Charles Murray's &quot;Apollo&quot;- only go so far in giving the reader a sense of what it was really like, working in a group that was essentially inventing the space program from scratch.<br />Chris Kraft's book is different in a couple of ways. He was one of the very few people in the program who was there at the very beginning, all the way through Apollo, and he is one of the few who worked at every level of the organization, from low level engineer to director.  He's as technically sophisticated as anyone who's ever written about the space program, and he's not shy about telling what he thought of people. He alternately praises and condemns, sometimes when speaking of the same person. He's generous with the priase for those he considered the great minds of space flight, like Gilruth and Faget. Even when criticizing, he's not unwilling to give credit where credit is due, even to those people, like von Braun, whom he had a strong dislike for, or Glenn, whom he thought acheived his position in the space program more from politics and self-promotion than from any ability as a test pilot.<br />While many of these stories have been told before, Kraft's telling has a level of personal detail that isn't to be found in any other book. Not surprising, as he was central to so many of the decisions. Anyone with an interest in the space program has probably read about Scott Carpenter's screwup in his one and only  mission, but as Kraft tells it, there's a lot more to the story. He goes into some detail on the events leading up to Carpenter's flight, and in the end gives Carpenter credit for his willingness to take responsibility for his actions.  Certainly much of it is self serving; there's a certain posessiveness of the entire space program apparant, and when Kraft praises the work of the men he trained he's giving himself quite a pat on the back at the same time. And sometimes he seems to be suggesting that he was the only person in the room, or in the entire program, who had the right answers. His dislike for von Braun seems to stem not only from von Braun's arrogance as from the credit von Braun was typically given in the press, who portrayed him as the architect of the entire space program, and not just its booster rockets.<br />But even given these faults, this is still one of the best books to date on the US space program. Certainly it's one of a very few books that I would consider an absolute must for the library of any fan of space travel.ing up to Carpenter's flight, and in the end gives Carpenter credit for his willingness to take responsibility for his actions.

Apparantly we had gotten it all wrong, and were doing things like being soldiers, hunting and fishing, grunting, scratching outselves and all sorts of other objectionable behavior. What we should really do was concentrate on being sensitive, caring, nurturing beings who could cry.<br /><br />Now a lot of men were anxious to to do the right thing and so they embraced this idea, and worked hard at becoming the new man. They read books, went to sensitivity sessions and spent a lot of time comparing themselves to Alan Alda. Unfortunately what they transformed themselves into was a sort of drone that had no traditional male qualities and of course no useful female qualities either. Women reacted to the new man by looking around and wondering where all the old men went. What's a guy to do?<br /><br />Along comes Robert Bly to point the way. See, we were busy becoming the wrong kind of new man. Now we're supposed to go off to the woods with a bunch of guys, scratch ourselves, talk about the pain of being men and how our fathers never gave us the love we craved and just have ourselves a good old cry.<br /><br />Of course all this takes a lot of time, and if you're like most men you probably don't have a lot of time to run off to the woods and sit in a circle sharing your pain every night. Plus if you're married your wife isn't much buying that story about going off to the woods every weekend so you can learn to be a New Man. She may not be thrilled with the exiting version but at the same time she may not be ready to swap you for the Bly-endorsed new version.<br /><br />So what's a man to do? Well, surprisingly, men have been figuring out how to be men pretty much on their own for the last 4 or 8 million years, and most of them do a fair good job without ever having held a talking stick or sharing any pain whatsoever. You can do what they do. Just follow your instincts, be nice to people, and look after your family. If you're still puzzled, go rent a copy of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". Watch it a few times, and if you ever find yourself wondering what to do, just ask yourself \\"What would Gregory Peck do?\\" You'll do just fine.Just follow your instincts, be nice to people, and look after your family.

This is no quick study, but a dense, detailed and yet very engaging study of the origins and history of the entire European peninsula. I have been reading this volume for two weeks no, inching along, absorbing the material as fast as I dare, and I'm still only a quarter of the way trhough the book. For example, in the space of six pages detailing Roman spiritual life, Davies also gives us: Detailed sidebars on the Arician cult; why for both the Greeks and Romans there was only one word that descibed both Cedar and Juniper; a history of Samian Pottery and its place in Roman life; and both a biography of Spartacus and a history of the subsequent use of the name of Spartacus in various utopian political movements- plus further cross references to related sidebars.  There is so much here, in the narrative the the numerous sidebars, that it nearly threatens to overwhelm the reader at times. And yet the narrative never suffers for all this detail.<br />The result of all this is great entertainment for the history buff as well as detailed narrative an some unique perspectives for the specialist. A fine read.	2001-03-23

The story it told was far from the public's preconceived notions about dry, dull scientists plodding away relentlessly towords some foregone conclusion. This was a story with sex, intrigue, gossip and a great race to see who would win the big prize- since it was well known that whoever cracked the structure of DNA was a shoe-in for a Nobel.<br />Reading it today, over 40 years after in was published, and after a brief career in scientific research, I'm struck not so much by the antics of Watson and Crick as I am by the cavelier way they denigrated their rivals, poached on thier areas of research,  and stole from them when necessary. Especially noteworthy is the way women were abused in this old-boy world. You don't have to be a radical feminist to be astounded at the way the abuse heaped on females in general, and on Rosalind Franklin in particular.<br />Franklin was the first to produce the excellent x-ray crystallography that led Watson and Crick to their insights into the structure of DNA. With little regard for her or her work, they used her data without permission in their publications, and were pleased when a researcher with a dislike for intelligent and independant women arranged for Franklin to be sent away to another institute- and essentially banned from continuing work on DNA. Franklin produced a wealth of good work in other areas, and tragically died young before her story could be told.<br />Writing &quot;The Double Helix&quot;  ten years after the events of the book, and though acknowledging some of Franklin's contributions, Watson still seems loathe to give her any real credit. In the epilogue he acknowledges that her contributions were under valued at the time, yet he resists stating the obvious- that without her work, his would not have been possible.  She truely deserved equal credit with Watson and Crick (and Wilkins) in the discovery of the double helix.<br />Read this book, but also read &quot;Rosalind Franklin and DNA&quot; by Anne Sayre for a more complete picture.Watson and Crick (and Wilkins) in the discovery of the double helix.<br />Read this book, but also read &quot;Rosalind Franklin and DNA&quot; by Anne Sayre for a more complete picture.	2001-03-22

The newspapers are full of hacks and mediocre economists like Paul Krugman passing off political opinion as economic wisdom. For that matter, most of what is presented as economic knowledge is political opinion. Most competant economists, whatever thier philisophical stance, pretty much agree among themselves as to the basic dynamics of the economy; it's the policy choices that divide them. Yet few economic writers  in the public eye make this clear. They're more likely to present one side of a political argument and call it economic truth. Or they present a simple appear to ignorance that devalues their own profession: &quot;As is obvious to the simplest reader...&quot; To the public, economists are people who can't agree among themselves, can't predict where the market is going and certainly don't seem to be able to give the government any good advice. What use are they?<br />And then along comes someone like Barro. Here's a modern economist who is conversant with the latest theoretical models and yet who still has a good intuitive understanding of the basics of supply and demand. Barro doesn't have to throw up a smokescreen of buzzwords to intimidate the reader. He can walk you through an argument in a way that makes makes complex questions clear. In this volume he considers a number of contemporary issues, analyzes the underlying economic issues, and  unlike most of his contempraries, presents a wealth of historical data to illustrate his points. And if that weren't enough, he analyzes both sides of an issue honestly.<br />Barro covers most of the contemporary economic issues that fill newspaper columns these days. Growth, monetary and fiscal policy, balance of trade, the role of the fed, the effects of regulation... it's all here. This isn't light reading, but it's nothing that a reasonably intelligent person can't follow. Plus,  it's well written and downright entertaining. You can't ask for more.downright entertaining.

Taylor that an amateur historian is an historian nonetheless. And as amateurs go, Len Deighton is one of the best. His previous books on World War II have offered novel insights and combined with sharp writing.<br />In &quot;Blood, Tears and Folly&quot; Deighton takes a critical look at the leaders of WWII and many of their decisions, strategic and tactical. He challanges the notion that Rommel was a great general, arguing that he he was a fine divisional commander who wasn't up to the challange of managing Afrika Corps, and it was Rommel's mismanagement as much as anything that resulted in his defeat.<br />While he finds plenty of fault in every country's leaders, political and military, most of Deighton's criticism is reserved for his own country's ministers and generals. He is particularly  incensed at the rigid class system in Great Britain that resulted in positions of command being given out based on birth, punished innovation, and nearly lost the war before it began. Deighton has harsh criticism for for men like &quot;Bomber&quot; Harris, who wasted thousands of lives pursuing a strategy that produced few results, and denied close air support to troops who needed it.<br />All in all an excellently argued, well documented and entertaining piece of work that belongs in the library of anyone interested in WWII history.	2001-03-05

I must have thirty or forty books on Chinese cooking, and most are full of the kinds of restaurant dishes and banquet dishes that aren't terribly representative of what Chinese families actually eat when they dine together. This book is different. It's full of what you might call Chinese comfort food- the food the authors grew up eating, and that reminds them of home. A lot of it is the kind of food most Westerners never get to taste unless they're lucky enough to be the guest of Chinese hosts- food like winter melon soup, or humble food like jook.<br />Add to that the beautiful watercolors and the authors' stories of growing up together (and eating together) and you have an absolute treasure of a book.

While it does have a marvelous treatment of modern 20th century cryptography- including the best description of the German Enigma machine and WWII Bletchly Park decoding activities I've yet read- what really makes this book shine is all the marvelous historical material.<br />Most books on codes and ciphers begin with something like ancient Roman transpotion ciphers. Singh takes a different track. For him, what's most interesting is not the encoding- which is often a trivial process- but the attempts to break encrypted texts. To this end, Singh tells the story of the decypherment of Linear B, an ancient script that was for decades in the 19th century perhaps the greatest puzzle confronting scholars. The tale of the decipherment of Linear B is not only a gripping and fascinating tale in and of itself, but also the perfect story to introduce the reader to the methodology of codebreaking.<br />From Linear B to quantum encryptation, Singh explains it clearly and fully; he's both skilled mathematician and gifted teacher. This is a marvelously entertaining and illiminating read, not only for those interested in the nuts and bolts of cryptography but for those curious about the historical context as well.	2001-01-05

The story begins with the discovery and translation in the early 19th century of the ancient Persian histories and legends. One of these- the legend of Gilgamesh, an ancient Persian king- stunned the Western world with its tale of a great flood that closely paralled the Biblical flood told of in Genesis.<br />The second piece of the puzzle came from geological research in the 1960s and 70s. This was the stunning discovery that the Mediterranean was once a desert that had been turned into a sea in one cataclysmic event. This in turn suggested that there may well have been other such events during the time of human habitation, including one massive flooding that was the basis of all the flood stories found in all the cultures of Europe and Asia.<br />Starting from that discovery, the authors explore the geological, historical and linguistic data in search of the event or events that became the basis for all flood legends of the Mideast, and explore the possibility that it was just such a flood that motivated a great exodus of people that eventually populated areas as far away as Western Europe and China.<br />The authors have been deeply involved in this research from the beginning, with one (Ryan) having been aboard the Glomar Challanger in the 1970s when the evidence of the great Mediterranean deluge was discovered. They do an excellent job not only of explaining the scientific data, but of sharing the real excitement of discovery that they have felt. Highly recommended for students of geology, archeology, ancient history, classics and biblical studies, as well as the casual educated reader looking for an excellent tale of scientific and historical discovery.	2001-01-05

Iron Bravo is a semi-fictional account of the history of the US infantry as seen and understod by one NCO- a lifer named Crane- through his knowledge of unit history, his memories of Vietnam and his experience in returning to war in the Gulf. Stroud spent a year with the 1st, and this book is a compilation of the experiences of various soldiers, retold as the story of Sgt. Crane.<br />There have been a great many books written about the experience of the infantryman through history, many of them excellent; what Carsten Stroud brings is a perspective over time. He's a combat veteran of Vietnam and a student of history, and he understands what it is that is common to the experience of the foot soldier throughout history. He takes pains to show how it it is that experiences of individual infantrymen through history constitute an unbroken thread across nations and through time. Stroud's description of the advance of the US 1st Armored Division through Iraq and his parallels to the WWII battle of the Kasserine Pass is particularly illustrative.<br />While not a scholarly history, neither is this the typical I-was-there story. It's a unique way of telling the infantryman's story, and as such, of interest to readers of both combat stories and military history.	2001-01-02

Much of this is a re-examination of why we failed in Vietnam- a subject covered brilliantly in Summers' earlier &quot;On Strategy:&quot;- and the changes in US Military policy that followed.

Hetchins judges Clinton with a degree of vitriol that would do credit to Clinton's most strident foes on the right.<br />Hetchins' primary attack is on what he sees as failings in Clinton's character as expressed in Clinton's betrayal of the traditional left wing of the Democratic party. In Hetchins' view,  the most distinguishing feature of the Clinton years has been what Hetchins calls &quot;triangularization&quot;. CLinton makes promises to the left while at the same time making deals with the right, all the while using and betraying the people in his administration. To this end he has surrounded himself with people  Hetchins sees as weak and accomodating (Janet Reno) or easily used and betrayed (Leon Panetta).<br />While Hetchins disagrees with those to his right as to the exact nature of many of Clinton's sins- the right would see Clinton's support of NAFTA as evidence of his intelligence and understanding of globalization- both would agree on the underlying character of the man, and both would agree on the characterization of Clinton as a manipulative sexual predator.<br />Hetchins does fall prey to many of the same faults critics have found in the writings of the right- he is prone to accept accusations as fact based on his impression of Clinton's character, and and he judges Clinton's character based on the acts he accuses him of.<br />Nonetheless it's an interesting perspective, and one of interest to critics of the Clinton years on both left and right.	2000-12-30

The result is a confused jumble of facts, so poorly organized that the reader has trouble simply trying to figure out the sequence of events described.<br />Beyond the many spelling and punctuation errors (the author needs a serious tutorial on how to use apostrophes)and the hideous typeface are hundreds of confused descriptions and misuses of words that leave the reader not only confused, but occasionally laughing out loud. Consider the description of Hyman Altma. Having described him as a man who stood 5'8&quot; and weighed 200 lbs, Kavieff goes on to say of this rather short man &quot;Because of his formidable stature...&quot; In a number of sections, the same sentence is repeated two or three times- which makes the reader wonder if even the author had given it a final reading before sending it off to his publisher.<br />This mess of a book has one redeeming feature- Kavieff has assembled a very complete and fascinating history of the Purple gang.

The two of course immediately failt to hit it off, as Wolcox sees Penrose as embodying the worst sort of intellectual, left wing nonsense, and Penrose sees Wolcox as embodying evil Thatcherism.<br />But then one of those chance, almost synchronistic occurances that pepper Lodge novels redefines their view of one another, and from that point on things take a decidedly different turn. There's still that essential conflict- but suddenly the protagonists see each other as human beings, and not as stereotypes.<br />As always, Lodge delivers a story that can be wickedly satirical while never descending to cruelty; even his most presposterous and obnoxious characters seem more objects of tolerent amusement than of derision. And as with most Lodge novels, the closer you are to academia, the more hilarious you'll find his characters.	2000-10-23

The tale of the  of Lindow Man- a body found in a peat bog- unfolds like a great mystery tale, and yet every bit of it is firmly rooted in fact. The story begins with the discovery of the body, and progresses through not only the investogation of the body itself, but through the discovery and reconstruction of ancient Celtic legends, the later British legends that derive from them, and finally their relation to the rituals that spelled the death of the man in the bog. The result is a tale far more exciting than anything you'd find in any fantasy or mystery novel.<br />Towords the end of the book, the authors get a bit speculative, but they're up front about this, and careful to seperate what's known from what is more conjectural. The authors' scientific training shows in the care they take to make the distinction clear.<br />Why this book went out of print when so many purely speculative books that aren't have as thrilling is certainly a mystery to me. If you have any interest in Celtic or Druid history, or in British legends, or in cultural and phsyical anthropology, get this book. If it doesn't go back into print soon, chase down a used copy. It's that good.	2000-10-10

There is a sort of sub-genre of literature that might be called the Academic Black Comedy. Kingsly Amis' &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; certainly falls into this category, as do many of David Lodge's books- &quot;Trading Places&quot; and &quot;Small World&quot;, to name two. Back in my high-stress grad school days I devoured these books. They portrayed academia as I saw it; that is, a strange, irrational world, not subject to the ordinary rules and mores of life.<br />It was during this time that a friend- a philosophy student widely regarded as the worst teaching assistant on campus- gave me a copy of &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot;. I started reading it that night and carried it with me all the next day, and the day after, reading it when I should have been doing other things.<br />&quot;The Rebels Angels&quot; is part mystery, part bawdy medieval tale and part academic satire. There's a mysterious and beautiful gypsy woman, a missing manuscript of Rablais (that may or may not actual exist), a gang of gypsie violin theives, and a cast of venal and backstabbing academics- some  fighting for the manuscript, some for the girl, and some for both, perhaps.<br />Wonderful entertainment- especially for anyone planning on going into academia. There's more truth in it than many academics would like to admit.	2000-10-02

Marks has the annoying habit of speaking in most indirect way at times- and worse, he constantly hints at matters without ever quite getting around to getting at all specific. And like many biographies it is limited in its view of the rest of the world; one gets the feeling at times that if not for Marks the entire Allied effort might have been compromised.<br />But there are just too many great stories and revelations in this  volume to be put off by stylistic objections. Marks was privy to some of the greatest secrets of WWII, and some of its legendary characters as well, like the famous Noor Inayat Kahn, better known by her code name, Madeleine. Marks' version of the story adds quite a bit to what's been told of her in the past. Certainly this is destined to be a classic of the literature of codes and cyphers, right up there with David Kahn's &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;.	2000-09-21

They cover the physical, computational,  biological and cognitive sciences, in each case with enough detail to  really convey the essence of the field while still remaining very readable  to the non-specialist reader. (There's a very detailed- and entertaining-  annotated bibliography for those looking for more detail.)<br />While there  are currently a number of very good non-technical introductions to  complexity theory by such skilled authors as John Casti, Mitchell  Feigenbaum and others, this particular volume may well be the best of an  excellent lot. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a a non-rigorous,  but non-trivial, introduction to the field.	2000-09-17

Thus we  have &quot;quantum jumps&quot; in everything from athletic shoes to  television sets, &quot;chaos&quot; from business consultants and self-help  gurus and now, The Meme.<br />It doesn't help that memes are more metaphor  than describable object; you won't see many papers being published in  rigorous  academic journals describing replication and mutation in memes.  That makes them all the more the perfect fodder for popular writers who can  make &quot;meme&quot; mean anything they care to. What's a meme? Well, what  do you want it to be?<br />The author of this book is a semi-retired  programmer whose previous book teaches us all how to be happy with only a  good self-image and a few million dollars in the bank. This book combines  the author's poor understanding of Dawkins' concept together with a fairly  shallow inderstanding of anthropology, psychology and other sciences to  deliver...not much.	2000-08-24

While no book is a replcement for a good  teacher, Seidman gives you enough to get out and teach yourself basic  strokes, braces and perhaps even rolls- though that's something best seen  demonstrated first.<br />The photos are one of the strongest parts of the  book, and a good argument for buying it- next to the &quot;Perforamance Sea  Kayaking&quot; video Seidman's book has the best illustrations of basic  moves to be found anywhere. If you were only going to buy one kayaking  book, this would not be a bad choice- but after working your way through it  you'd be well advised to move on to more detailed and specialized books as  well.	2000-08-23

There are a  number of essays on other topics, including some reviews of other writers;  I especially enjoyed his enthusiatic review of McPhee's &quot;Looking For a  Ship&quot;, itself a personal favorite of mine. For so prolific an author  Theroux's writing is always of the highest caliber; there are no wasted  words in a Theroux novel or travelogue, and yet no important detail goes  unrecorded or described. Given this you can see where his enthusiasm for  McPhee comes from; his admiration is obvious and freely given.<br />The  discussions of Theroux's own novels, and how  he came to write them, are  also particularly enjoyable and illuminating. The story of &quot;Mosquito  Coast&quot; covers not only the writing of the book, but the production of  the movie as well, and Theroux's description of how it brought out the  &quot;Allie&quot; in all involved- Producer, director, actors- is both  witty and revealing. The story behind &quot;Milroy the Magician&quot; will  prove interesting to anyone who has read &quot;The Happy Isles of  Oceania&quot;.<br />The travel stories, which do make up the bulk of the book,  will be familiar in scope and tone to anyone who has read Theroux. Here he  is, driving through remote Africa, wandering about in Singapore or kayaking  alone around Christmas Island amid the wildlife.<br />Reviews of Theroux's  travel writing often center on what a misanthrope he must be, or on the  accuracy of details and minutia contained in the books. But Theroux himself  points out in an essay on his late friend Bruce Chatwin that his books are  not meant to be a guide to a country, a people or even a city; they are  about the trip itself- his trip, not yours or anyone else's trip. In that  sense, even his worst critics must admit that he succeeds marvelously well.	2000-08-23

He's not just Canada's best  writer, he's one of the best English speaking writers, period. Reading  Davies is like reading the great writers of the Nineteeth Century, like  Trollop or Thackery, but with 20th Century sensibilities and settings. The  writing is rich and detailed, the characters alive and real. Davies paints  every last deatil, every stroke, every hair.<br />I first read The Trilogy as  an undergraduate in the 1970s, and I've returned to it every few years. In  a world overrun with sparse, affected postmodern writers repeating the same  tales of alienation and angst, Davies stands out for his style, his  detailed plot lines, his moving stories and his wit.	2000-08-21

Gurney's  book beins with voyages of the Dutch East India company, skirting the South  polar regions around the beginning of the 17th century and ends with the  complete maping of the coast of Antarctica in the mid-19th. Along the way  are detailed stories not only of the early polar explorers, but scores of  detailed asides on such diverse topics as the food and other provisions  used by sailors, the problem of scurvy, the history of the rum ration, and  the story of John Harrsion and his clocks that made detailed navigation and  mapping possible.

He's been kayaking for over  thirty years, and he's done some of the most difficult voyages in kayaking  history. He's specific in his recommendations, but open minded, too. He  favors feathered paddles, but he understands the advantage of unfeatehred  paddles, and allows how they may be superior in many conditions.<br />Dowd's  advice isn't based on theory, but on experience. He's not afraid to admit  his own mistakes, and in this latest edition, he desribes how he's changed  a lot of his opinons on the rescue techniques he's taught in the past. He's  realistic, and realizes that not every kayaker is going to develop a  bombproof roll or be able to perform the Borze's paddlefloat rescue; he  endorses alternate techniques like he (somewhat contentious) Sea  Wings.<br />What it boils down to is this: Whatever other books you may own,  whatever lessons you may have taken, whatever your level of experience- you  need this book.	2000-08-19

He has managed to pull together a number of areas into one cohesive thread; contemprary  topics such as complexity in population dynamics, game theory as applied to  natural selection and self-reproducing automata are discussed in a  suprisingly clear and intuitive manner. In one particularly impressive chapter, he begins with John Conway's \\"Life,\\" a cellular automata familiar to all computer programmers and hobbyists, and shows how even a computational machine this simple (Life has only three rules) can be used to create a self-replicating automaton. He builds it piece by piece in a way that's intuitively obvious, yet brilliant in its simple elegance.<br /><br /> Readers interested in artifical  life, the dynamics of population, self organized complexity will find this  a stimulating and entertaining read.	2000-07-21

Sure, it still has  the requisite bits of gross horor, and Lecter still has his taste for human  flesh- but what's missing is that sense of terror in the other two books,  the notion that some monster could be waiting outside for you, and there  was nothing you could do about it.<br />The Hannibal Lecter in  &quot;Hannibal&quot; is still a murdering sociopath, but this time aorund  he seesm to have good justification for all his acts of crime. He gets a  childhood. He becomes- dare I say it- a sympathetic figure. And that pretty  much takes away most of the suspense.<br />The figure of Claire Sterling  isn't fleshed out at all; she's a central character, but so poorly drawn as  to be almost incidental to the plot, as are a numebr of other characters  who drop in for a visit.<br />Most of the plot is telegraphed to the reader so  early on that there just aren't any surpises, save one- and that one is so  seemingly illogical as to appear completely unmotivated.<br />In short, a fair  piece of suspense writing, but not up to the author's previous books.	2000-07-17

He has constructed a sort of theory of metaphor to explain social phenomena, which puts me in mind of an old quote, that &quot;proof by metaphor is no proof at all&quot;.<br />In this book Lakoff has discivered that the metaphor of the family may be extended to all manner of political and social phenomena. In doing so he discovers that while conservatives are wrong, they're not actually evil, just insufficiently progressive. They're motivated by good intentions but stuck in an old model of family interaction. Yes, it's that simple...<br />Lakoff suffers from the common academic conceit of having an overly simplified view of areas other than his own. Ignoring a few thousand yeatrs of history and scholarship, his analysis simply relates all beliefs to a rather simple quasi-Freudian metaphor rather than looking at what underlying beliefs may be responsible.<br />Readers interested in a criticla analysis of the differences underlying political beliefs would be better off reading Thomas Sowell's 1988 &quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot;.  Readers of a more leftist bent might find Alan Garfinkel's &quot;Forms of Explaination&quot; interesting as well.	2000-07-05

I'd been reading Per Bok's &quot;How Nature Works&quot; and realized I need a better grounding in the basics of fractal mathematics; this book turned out to be just the ticket.<br />Schroeder  starst out with some simple, intuitive examples of curves and regions that  do not scale to integral proportions, and from thse he develops and  introduces the notion of the Hausdorf dimension of a curve. From there he  introduces new concepts graphically- like Koch snowflakes and the  Serpienski gasket- by first constructing them and then doing the analysis,  introducing new concepts as needed to advance the illustration.<br />Often  Schroeder starts with very non-geometric illustrations; his section on  power laws begins with a discussion of language and word frequency, and  from there he introduces Zipf's law, and then generalizes to  characteristics of power law distributions in general- but not before  treating the reading to a fascinating discourse on cognates and false  cognates between languages- which he manages to weave into a discussion of  self-similarity. Brilliant!<br />&quot;Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws&quot;  could easily be used for a University-level introduction to fractal math,  for  graduate students or advanced undergrads- yet it's still readable  enough to be a find introduction and entertainment to the reader with only  a basic background in algebra and perhaps some calculus. The casual reader  might not follow all the mathmatical arguments, but he or she could still  glean much from this book. Highly recommended for the mathematically  inclined looking for education or entertainment.	2000-06-19

The techniques used in construction are very traditional; no plywood, epoxy or synthetic bedding compunds found here.  It's not a  beginner's book, either, although a careful craftsman could probably build  the first one or two boats with a little thought.<br />But even if you never  built any of these boats-- and I suspect most who buy the book fall into  this category-- this volume is still a wonderful addition to the bookshelf.  I bought my copy before I knew anything about boat construction, and the  more I learn, the more I enjoy casually thumbing through it. At the price,  it's a bargain; I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in boat design,  or traditional construction, or who just likes looking at boat plans.	2000-05-31

But Sam Devlin has been building large  boats for many years with stitch and glue, and in this books shows why it's  an appropriate technique for any size boat.<br />Traditional plywood  boatbuilding doesn't really take advantage of the structural properties of  plywood, argues Devlin; if you build a frame and then cover it with sheets  of plywood in the same way you'd plank with boards, you're not really  gaining much other than the convenience of the larger sheets. You're still  using the same techniques of a century ago.<br />Stitch and glue allows the  builder to make strong frameless monococque structures in which the entire  skin, and not just the frames, carries the load. Such structures are much  lighter and stiffer than traditional framed structures. Aircraft builders  have been using monococques since the 1930s, and automobiles have been  built using monocoque (&quot;unibody&quot;) construction since the  1960s.<br />Devlin assumes the reader of this book knows a little about boats,  but nothing about stitch and glue construction. He provides excellent  detail on the tools, techniques and materials needed, as well as numerous  photos and a number of designs.<br />Whether you're planning to build a 7'  pram or a 30' cruiser, there's much useful information here. Even if you  already have one of Dynamite Payson's &quot;Instant Boats&quot; books or  Chris Kulczycki's &quot;The Kayak Shop&quot; you'll want a copy of this  book as well.	2000-05-31

When GEB was first published,the reviews and enthusiasm were endless. It's a brilliant introduction to recursion, said many. No, it's an introduction to, and demonstration of Godel incompleteness, said others. It's a  demonstration of the commonality of art and science, said others. And  there's something about ants near the end, but we're not sure  why.<br />Readers today echo the same sentiments. They're all right, in their  own way- but none of these views really get at what Hofsteader was trying  to do. Yes, GEB is a tuorial on Godel, Bach, ants, recursion and a dozen  other esoteric topics, and it's a heck of an intellectual entertainment,  but Hofsteader didn't just write GEB to show prove what a clever book he  could write. At the core, GEB is, first and formost, a theory of Artifical  Intelligence; all the bits on Godel, recursion and  combinations are just a  tutorial to bring the reader up to speed for what's about to follow.<br />When  GEB was first published, the dominant paradigm in AI was top-down; you  built inference engines, programmed them with high-level knowledge about  systems, and tried to get them to generalize from their. To a small  minority- including Hofstader- this begged the really important questions:  Where did the ability to make inferences come from in the first place? How  was knowledge represented?<br />A few pioneers then- people like John Holland-  were looking at bottom-up models in which one posited the simplest levels  of an organization- the individual elements and the rules of  interconnection and communication. They reasoned that that's what the brain  was, so if you couldn't derive AI from a model that echoed the brain, you  weren't really proving anything. It was from this perspective that GEB was  written, and given the state of AI at the time, it's not surprising that  most readers- even the most enthusiastic among them- totally missed the  point.<br />Today, the bottom-up, or connectionist paradigm  is gaining new  respectability, and the work over the last few decades in complexity theory  has given us more insight into the mechanisms of connectionism. Reading GEB  in that context, not only is Hofstader's thesis much clearer, but the book  appears that much more brilliant and prescient, given when it was first  written.<br />If you've never read GEB, read it it now, and then read George  Dyson's &quot;Darwin Among the Machines&quot;, Waldrop's  &quot;Complexity&quot;, Resnick's &quot;Turtles, Termites and Traffic  James&quot;, and John Holland's &quot;Hidden Order&quot;.  If you've read  GEB before, take a look at those same books and then go back and reread  GEB. You'll  see it in an entirely new light.	2000-05-31

With Star LOGO, Mitchell Resnick has created a equally simple, yet  unbelievably powerful tool that can be used to experiment with ideas of  complexity.<br />&quot;Termites...&quot; is about how complex behaviors can  arise from very simple systems, and to that end Resnick provides a number  of case histories and simple programs that demonstrate how conceptually  complex systems can be simulated using only a few rules. Phenomena as  diverse as the movement of traffic james, pile making by termites and the  migration of slime molds can all be simulated in Star LOGO with very a few  assumtions. But Resnick's programs aren't just simulations; they're models  of the real underlying processes that govern these complex phenomena.<br />Resnick hasn't just created a clever program; he's provided a wonderful  tool for exploring complexity, and found a way of translating complexity  into something a child can understand- while still fascinating to an adult.	2000-05-31

The last few years have seen a flood of millennium-related books, ranging from the prophets of Y2K doom (or astronomical doom) to those of a new Eden. Admidst the more numerous books of a hysterical nature there have  been a few more serious books that have attempted to put the events and  changes of the last millenium in historical perspective, and to try and  show how today's world evolved from its past.<br />I am an amateur reader of  history, and the one conceptual difficulty I always have in reading history  is seeing how events in different parts of the globe relate to one another  in time. This is one area where &quot;Millenium&quot; excels. The author's  command of history, and his abilty to smoothly move the narration through  place and time creates, for the reader, a unified picture of the changes of  a thousand years. No small trick.<br />As Fernandez-Armesto says in his  preface, his aim is to &quot;see the millennium from an imaginary  distence...with unifying themes&quot; and &quot;to savor the differences  from place to place and from time to time...&quot; And so he does, with  impressive skill. The resultant book is both scholarly and fascinating; on  nearly every page you can find some previously unknown gem of art or  history or technology.<br />You may not agree with the author's  pronouncements for the future (as found in the epilogue) or his moral  positions regarding present-day Western democracies, or even his economic  analyses, but you cannot help but be impressed by his mastery of history,  and you may find yourself swayed by the historical evidence he provides. A  gem of a book, not to be missed.	2000-05-17

Unlike Sachs, Restak delves deeply into the  actual neuopathologies, the cells, the transmitters and the structure of  the brain. While the level of detail is relatively superficial from a  neuroanatomical point of view, the descriptions are still accurate and  detailed; this would have been a nice introductory book to have for my  first physiological psychology courses back in grad school.<br />As well as  being an excellent teacher, Restak is an excellent storyteller. Each  chapter reads like a good adventure, leading us through the neural  pathways, or like a mystery, tracing the history of a particular  neuropathology. If you enjoy the medical detective stories of Berton  Rouche, or the  essays of Lewis Thomas, you'll find much to interest you  here.	2000-05-17

I was mainly looking for some entertaining reading about boats, and it is that, but it's much more.<br />Gerr is not only a talented  naval architect, he's a skilled writer and teacher as well. &quot;The  Nature of Boats&quot; is really a text on boat design disguised as fun  reading. It's required reading for anyone considering designing a boat, and  a must have for anyone who likes reading about the nuts and bolts of boats,  too. I loaned my copy to a friend contemplating the purchase of a small  motor sailor, and didn't get it back for half a year. It now sits in the  center of the &quot;boatbuilding&quot; shelf in my home office, where I can  refer to it often.	2000-05-17

When he waxes ecstatic over bamboo rods, or explains how the Green Drake mayfly (Ephemerella grandis) is differentiated from its cousins, E.  doddsi and E. flavilinea, perhaps only a fisherman can understand exactly  why this is so important.<br />But reading Gierach isn't something you do to  learn about the technique or the science of fishing, or how to select a  rod, or how to cast. He's more about the philosophy of fishing, about why  we are willing to stand in the middle of a cold stream wearing silly  clothes and waving a stick over our heads. He's the ultimate Trout Bum, to  quote an earlier book, a man for whom there really is no other life, and  who has made a modest living for years just celebrating this life. And of  course he does this in a wonderfully witty way; no jokes, just a lot of  observations that will still make you smile the umpteenth time you read  them.<br />&quot;Dances with Trout&quot; is not just about trout fishing, or  about fishing, for that matter. The &quot;Scotland&quot; chapter doesn't  have much to say about how to fish for salmon; &quot;Fool Hen&quot; is  about grouse hunting, and &quot;In the Woods&quot; is about still hunting  for deer.<br />What ties all these stories together is Gierach's feeling of  comradery with his hunting and fishing pals, and even more so, a real  connection with the outdoors. In a time when for many, &quot;outdoor  sports&quot; means something like racing through the woods in a snowmobile,  tearing up the peace and quiet of a lake in a jetski or &quot;four  wheeling&quot;, Gierach writes about the simple pleasures of being outdoors  and absorbing the world around you.	2000-05-11

I was handed a copy of this book back in grad school. I was majoring in physiological psychology, but I used to drink with philosophers, as they provided a nice counterpoint to the philisophiocal stance of my teachers. At the time I found myself entranced with positivism, something that happens to all students of the sciences sooner or later. On the surface positivism promises quite a lot, not the least of which is the idea that it provides a truely *scientific* approach to knowledge and belief. I was all set to approach the mind in a purely mechanical way when my friend Patrick gave me a copy of Ayre's little book.<br /><br />A little historical background: At the time \\"Language, Truth and Logic\\" was written, positivism was the hot topic in the philosophical world, and had adherents far beyond philosophy alone- for instance, in psychology, the Behaviorists, led by John Watson, were developing a positivist theory of psychology- a view that still has its strong adherents.<br /><br />What Ayre discovered in his meetings with Positivists was that Positivism contained the seeds of its own destruction- it could not itself pass the tests it proposed for a theory of knowledge. So I read Ayre. I thought about the argument, and the more I thought about it, the clearer it seemed. I couldn't come up with a decent counterargument. In the end, I rejected positivism, decided there was more to psychology than mere behavior, and switched my major to cognitive psychology. Quite an accomplishment for such a slim volume.	2000-05-11

Too many books gloss over the details- \\"now attach the binding...\\" Atach it? How? To what? WIth  what glue? The reader is left wondering, and eventually gives up or tries  hit and miss to figure it out. But Erlewine takes you through the whole  process step by step, assuming nothing.

For some, color is the critical factor; others say it's mathing the hatch precisely. Still others insist on exact dupication of an insect.<br />Proper started out with a very different aproach- perhaps the  most scientific of them all. He asked, what arethe specific features that  insects key on in feeding? Surprisingly, there are very few, and most of an  trout's diet can be simulated with a small number of designs in a few  colors. <br />Proper doesn't present endless variations and complex designs.  Instead, he lays out a elatively small number of designs, with a rational  for each. He doesn't go into detail on how to tie them- it's assumed the  reader knows how- and he doesn't get to specific about color either. That's  something else the reader can choose to match the circumstances.<br />It's a  beautiful, elegant system, and one every experienced fsherman should read.	2000-05-10

If I were to describe this volume as a coffee table book on linguistics, you'd be forgiven for thinking that it would be hard to imagine something less inviting. Maybe a history of grout?<br />But that's what it is, and it's  absolutely fascinating. It's a large format, profusely illustrated book on  the history, structure, analysis and use of the English language, from the  earliest arrival of the Angles in the British Isles, to the latest  computerized analyses of language, and everything in between. There are  features on Old English, dialect, regional differences, drift, humor,  grammer, writing systems, alphabets...and it's all presented in the most  engaging and entertaining manner.<br />Now I am perhaps more enamored of this  sort of thing than the typical reader, having come from a psycholinguistics  background, but I think there's much in here to entertain (and inform)  anyone with even a passing interest in language, and English in particular.  There are long articles that delve into areas in detail, but there are also  enough brief sidebars to make this an excellent book for simply opening at  random to pick out an entertaining bit here and there.<br />And of course it's  all authoritative enough to serve as an excellent resource for the  beginning linguistics student as well.

What started as a research instrument has been revealed as  the ultimate spy satellite. This alone makes it a political hot potato, as  different factions fight over control of the scope .<br />Unknown to the  governments on earth fighting over the scope, the researchers on board have  discovered that other civilizations are broadcasting information viewable  by the scope, if you're smart enogh to figure out the code. But there's a  catch: Everyone of the brilliant scientists who has thus tried to read the  signal has ended up dead or brain damaged. The last man to try sent for a  childhood friend before the attempt that left him in a vegetative state.  What's odd is the friend he sent for isn't a genius like the others; he's  downright dull, by all appearances.<br />Affairs come to a crisis when a  powerful and very intelligent Senator demands access to the scope- and is  killed by it. Faced with the seizure of the  scope by the military, the  researchers on board cut it loose and flee into space.<br />That's just the  first chapter. What follows is one of the most original and imaginative  novels in SciFi. I first read it back in high school, in 1970; it's still  fresh today.	2000-05-03

But in  recent years a number of adventurous young theorists (and a number of  physics-ignorant speculative metaphysicians) have picked up the theory and  put it to use solving problems. One recent paper explains the dark matter  problem and the weak force of gravity buy supposing most of the gravitons  are clumped in a nearby, parallel universe. The author of the volume at  hand proposes to explain everything from the physics of the two-slit  experiment to free will via the multiverse, as he calls it.<br /><br />David Deutsch begins with the assumption that the multiverse theory is both true, and obvious, and spends his first chapter explaining why this must be the case. Everything that follows is built on this assumption, so if you don't accept that to be the case, the rest of his argument falls apart. I can't see any reason as to why I should reject the notion of the multiverse, but then, I can't give you any particularly reasons as to why I would accept it. I'm not a physicist, and so all I can say is that his reasoning seems sound to a layman. At any rate, it's useful to accept this idea, if only to see where Deutsch takes it.<br /><br />Starting with this notion, Deutsch proceeds to rip apart Inductionism (via a clever sort of Socratic dialogue), invoke artificial reality as a parallel way ot seeing actual reality, recast genetics as a kind of computational system, solve the problem of time travel and paradoxes, and in the end, recast existence as a program running on a giant computer. Breathtaking stuff, and well worth pouring through, even if you're not at all convinced. I found myself exiting a number of chapters not entirely sure I bought all the arguments presented, yet I poured through to the end.

This is a question that goes beyond simply  asking why shells spiral, or why snowflakes have symmetry; it asks instead  why do tree branches, root systems and the dendritic structures of nerve  cells all share a common structure?<br />I've been curious about this  question since my early grad school days, but for a long time the topic was  thought at a minimum to be a rather eccentric one; many thought it simply  unproductive, or even unscientific.<br />But the last twenty years has seen an  explosion in the areas of complexity, chaos and other studies that go to  the heart of asking why the world is structured (on a macroscopic scale)  the way it is, and why there are so many parallels of structure between  seemingly unrelated entities.<br />While there have been a great many books in  recent years looking at that very question, &quot;The Self-Made  Tapestry&quot; is this first really complete overview of the field and its  history, and it's quite an accomplishment. Profusely illustrated,  engagingly written, and marvelously clear, it's not only a wonderful  reference book, it's marvelously entertaining to read as well.<br />If you've  found yourself in recent times pouring over Glieck's &quot;Chaos&quot;, or  perhaps Stuart Kauffman's books on self-organization, or Waldrop's  &quot;Complexity&quot;, you'll delight in this book.

This book, Bach's first, is something entirely different. It's a classic in the  tradition of great flight books like \\"Fate is the Hunter\\" and  \\"Night Flight\\"<br /><br />Written when Bach was an Air National Guard  pilot, \\"Stranger to the Ground\\" takes you along for what is in  essence a very humdrum and ordinary flight as he ferries an F84F from  Germany to England. It's fairly uneventful; he passes through a storm, but  he's well equipped to handle it. He even claims that the F84 is so easy to  fly, anyone could handle it in level flight.<br /><br />What makes it special is  Bach's narration- how he conveys the wonder of it all, and finds the magic  in the simple act of flying, and the excitement of those small moments,  like finding the coast, sighting the airfield and landing the plane.<br /><br />If  you're not one who finds wonder in the simple act of flight, you may wonder  why anyone would read this book. But if you're the type who looks up  whenever an aircraft passes overhead, or who always takes the window seat  on an airliner, or you're a pilot yourself, this is one of the finest books  ever written on what it means to fly.	2000-04-26

For people who don't understand the joy of flight, Coont's book makes little sense. It's just a story about a guy flying around in a plane, fergoshsakes. I mean, what gives? But for those who hang on to the words of St. Exupery, or Ernest Gann, or Richard Bach (before that book about the bird), Coont's book about his coast to coast flight in a Stearman bipe is sheer joy.

Here we have men driven not by ambition, but by the desire to  simply earn a living, who regulalry face dangers equal to those faced by  climbers, and who even with the best precautions and safety gear know that  there's a good chance they may not be coming back. It's an intimate picture  of the men who fish the North Atlantic and the community they live in, as  well as the story of a storm and the destruction it left in its path.<br />Once I picked the book up, it really was impossible to put aside. I  found myself reading it while walking along the sidewalk on my way to  lunch, when a woman stopped me and asked &quot;Is that any good? It's been  sitting on my bookshel for a few weeks&quot;. I told her to run home and  read it, and a week later I ran into her again, and she raved over it, too.  So does everyone I recommend it to.

In brief, Baron Cohen postulates that autistic children lack the ability to interpret the  mental states of others, and consequently cannot assign mental causes to  the actions of others. He explains this in terms of autictics lacking  certain postulated mental structures involved in what he calls &quot;mind  reading&quot;; for instance, most autistic children do not seem to be able  to follow the gaze of another person, a skill that Baron-Cohen believes is  central to understanding another's intentions.<br />While I find his arguments  well supported by the data, I do have some differences with him as to the  primacy of causation in his model. I would suggest that the reason the  analytic mechanisms are absent is that the underlying mental state are  absent. For instance, in the writings of one noted high-funtioning  autistic, Temple Grandin, she notes that certain mental states having to do  with  interpersonal relationships are simply unknown to her; she cannot  really understand deep friendships and love. To me this suggests not merely  the absence of an an analytic and conceptual mechanism, but also the  absence of certain physiological correlates that underly the emotions  that  are a large componant of social attachements.<br />Regardless,  &quot;Mindblindness&quot; is an excellent addition to the theoretical  literature of autism and serves as a superb summary of much of the  experimental data as well.	2000-04-26

Luckily, his books are now being reissued in new editions and he's having a real renaissance among readers.<br />The new editions do suffer from awful, pretentious introductions; normally the words \\"transgresses\\" and \\"encomia\\" are only seen in the writings of obscure critical studies writers and pretentious undergraduates. But these can be ignored.<br /><br />I was introduced to Bester via, of all things, an interview with Steely Dan's Donald Fagen, who said that reading these stories as a teen opened up his imagination. Sure, Bester is not the best stylist or writer of his era; truth be told, as a writer, he's pretty ordinary. But he wrote original, engaging stories, and he had great ideas, and I think that's what makes a great SF novel.	2000-03-26

Sokol established, once and for all, that the postmodern emporer has no clothes.<br />For those of us in the sciences, who believe in not only a real universe but a deterministic one,  and for whom the gradual incursion of the deconstructionists into the hard  sciences has been  something of a creeping nightmare, the entire Sokol  affair has been a breath of fresh air. For a long time we've watched as  English, Sociology and Law faculties has gradually been taken over by  people for whom all of history and the works of scholars are reduced to  &quot;texts&quot; containing no meaning of their own. In this world,  scholarship is reduced to clever wordplay in which academic success is  mainly a matter of how well the writer can mimic the language and stroke  the egos of the arbiters of the field. (Oddly enough, the postmodern clique  still think their own &quot;texts&quot; are immune from such  deconstruction, as much of the criticism of Sokol shows.)<br />Sokol,  suspecting something was rotten at the core of this mess, wrote a  nonsensical piece that simply pushed all the right buttons and stroked the  right egos, and as he feared, the postmodernists confirmed his worst fears  by accepting it for publication.<br />This left the journal's editors in a  difficult posisiton- how to attack Sokol without admitting that they print  articles they can't understand? The answer, of course, was personal attack,  and the whole postmodern commmmunity has joined in the chorus.<br />If you've  always been suspicious that there's less than meets the eye in this new  deconstructionist world, read this book. And if you're a graduate student  caught under the spell of the postmodern revolution, read this book. It may  help you return  to scholarship and save yourself a lot of future  embarrassment!	2000-03-07

He died some time ago, and his books are now over forty years old. Some, like his history of 20th century physics, may seem a bit dated in light of the discoveries since  then.<br />Yet there's still magic in these pages. Gamow was one of the  greatest of 20th century physicists, and at the same time, a great teacher  whose passion for the sheer fun of math and science was communicated in his  books, whether explaining the wonders of infinite series, or how to locate  a hidden pirate's treasure chest using imaginary numbers. Unlike a lot of  modern poipular science writers, Gamow didn't shy away from showing you the  math- but he could explain in a way that even an elementary school child  could understand.<br />A wonderful book for the child or adult who isn't  afraid to think.	2000-03-06

Vogel is one of those rare authors who can communicate the essence of a complex technical field without either dumbing it down or making it so complex as to be  unapproachable to the lay reader. &quot;Cat's Paws and Catapults&quot; is  just full of elegant, clear text and beautiful pen-and-ink illustrations  that make the difficult clear.<br />Vogel begins by comparing nature's  solutions to problems of structure, propulsion and so forth with the  creations of man, illustrating the differences and the similarities in how  the two evolve. He differs with those philosophers who have argued that  within nature might be found the ideal solutions to the problems of  engineering and design, and gives convincing examples to support his case.  He works though issues in structure, transport, proplsion and so on showing  the differnt ways in which nature and man arrive at solutions, and argues  why each may or may not be optimal.<br />One chapter is devoted to the  question of scale, and how it influences design. For example, the houses  built by humans are, despite all their nails and other fasteners, mainly  held together by gravity. Things like nails and mortar serve mainly to keep  bits from sliding off each other. That's not possible when building  something the size of a bacterium; at that scale, gravity is essentially  negligible.<br />Scale is similarly important in building a flying machine.  Aircraft and insects fly in very different environments. Airplanes must fly  fast to overcome gravity, whereas insects fly slowly, in an environment  where drag is the main force to be overcome.<br />And that's just one small  section. There are chapters on surfaces and angles, on soft versus hard, on  pulling versus pushing, on the problem of making copies and many other  topics as well.<br />As I read &quot;Cat's Paws&quot; I found myself making a  tremendous number of penciled notes in the margin, arguing with some points  and agreeing with others.  It's not that there was that much I disagreed  with, but rather that the book engaged me to the point that I felt I was in  a dialogue with the author.

The partipants are C.P. Snow, J.B.S. Haldane, Ludwig  Wittgenstein, Alan Turing  and Erwin Schroedinger, all of whose works  have contributed to the debate in the years since. Casti's prose may be a  bit clumsy at times, and his settings a bit forced, but he does a  marvelous job of letting the characters expound their  philisophical  views and play them out against each other. He plays a little loose with  history- for example he  introduces John Searle's &quot;Chinese  Room&quot; argument about 30 years early- but he does so in a way that  follows  naturally from the writings of his characters. I was basically  familiar with the arguments in the book, but hadn't really  read much  in the area in a number of years. Casti's book was a very entertaining  review for me. For someone unfamiliar  with the issues it would be a  great introduction.	2000-03-02

Most, if not all of the Bobby Kennedy legend goes back to Kennedy's brief run at the presidency and assassination by Sirhan Sirhan. Since that time he has been memorialized not for what he accomplished  (precious little, in  his time in government) but  rather for the perceived promise of his  candidacy.<br />But the real Bobby Kennedy was very different from the  legend. Those old enough to actually remember his tenure as Attorney  General are in their 50s and older, and even those in their 40s today were  only in their early teens when he was killed.<br />Like his older brothers,  Bobby died young enough and left little anough of an actual public record  that he has been held up as an icon of liberalism- a philosophy he really  had little patience for. His first real job in Washington was as an aide to  Joseph McCarthy, after all- a task he pursued with zeal. It is a measure of  the difference between the real and the actual Bobby Kennedy that his  strongest supporters have little to cite in his defense in the way of  actual accomplishments; his behavior throughout his career paints a picture  very different from the legend.<br />Some may percieve this book as mean  spirited, and perhaps it does go a bit overboard in its criticism- oddly  enough, from the extreme left, not the right- but this book is the first  real historical treatment of the actual political life of Bobby Kennedy,  and as such fill a real void in the history of the politics of the 1950s  and 1960s.	2000-02-29

Men in particular seem to be fascinated with the  materials and tools of work they once disdained. Perhaps it's something  genetic.<br />The last few years has seen an explosion, it seems, in books  that try to tell us about these objects that were once part  of everyday  experience. Robert Pirsig tapped into something when he wrote &quot;Zen and  the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;. (Beyond stealing the title from  Herrigel's &quot;Zen and the Art of Archery&quot;, that is). There are  books about the Zen of timber framing, the spiritual aspects of  homebuiilding, and for all I know, personal growth acheived through snaking  out clogged plumbing.<br />Among these books is a sub-genre that's just about  the pure pleasure of stuff. (There is, in fact, a book called  &quot;Stuff&quot; that's quite good.) Forget accomplishing something;  there's a great deal of enjoyment to be had in just handling tools,  hardware and lumber, and that's what Staten's book is about.<br />Staten grew  up in a hardware store and has the easy familiarity with the materials that  fill the shleves and bins. He has stories to tell about the store, the  people who work there and the people who shop there, and woven through the  book is the story of the rise and eventual decline of the neighborhood  hardware store- and his father's store.<br />Mst of the book is roughly  organized into departments, so you wander from Tools to Paint to Lawn and  Garden and so forth. Within each department you work your way down the  aisles, encountering items: 12 inch GE Fluorescent Bulb: $2.98. Stanley  Coping Saw: $12.98. Each item listing is followed by a short essay-  anywhere from a paragraph to a few pages- with perhaps some history of the  object, a discussion of why one might choose one material over another or  some other bit of fascinating trivia. Most of it is very good, but I did  spot quite a few errors; for example, Edison's incandescent bulb was not  invented to be the closest thing to daylight, flint sandpaper doesn't wear  by losing large pieces of grit (they fracture, which is actually useful in  some ways), it is most certainly not true that &quot;no one knows [how  superglue works]&quot;, and the &quot;d&quot; used to designate nail sizes  didn't mean &quot;pound&quot; in England; it meant, and still means  &quot;penny&quot;, coming from the Latin &quot;denir&quot;, a small coin.  And if you think, as Staten writes, that a weed eater won't cut your hand  or foot, you're in for a rough surprise. Of course, this is a book for  casual reading and not a reference book, so that's not a fatal flaw, but I  still would have liked to see a little better error checking.<br />There's one  other thing that annoys me about the book. When he's in the midst of a long  discourse about the history of a shovel, or the salemen who worked in his  father's store, Staten's writing flows very nicely. It's a pleasure to  read. But every so often he falls into the sort of punchy, fragmented style  that sports reporters are so fond of.  Like this.  You know?  And I find  that exceptionally annoying.<br />But overall this is an enjoyable read, and  the organization makes it easy to dip into it at the odd time to read a  paragraph or two.

And you've got to  love a guy who can characterize chaotic phenomena as  \\"gnarly\\".<br /><br />\\"Seek!\\" is a collection of essays on  various topics, published and unpublished, and therein lies one of the  problems: A lot of these essays would have been better off remaining  unpublished. They're just not that interesting or well done. Even some of  the published essays should have stayed buried in the pulps where they were  printed. The book is of course required reading for die-hard Rucker fans,  but the general reader would be better off sticking with his more carefully  edited books.<br />His history of computers, for example, is a completely  unoriginal rehashing of the standard hardwware-based story. There's  absolutely no point in reprinting it, particuarly as he has nothing to add  to a thousand other books.<br /><br />There's another problem as well. Like many  very bright academics, Rucker seems to believe that skill in one area-  mathematics- makes him an expert in all areas. Unfortunately there are some  (history, economics, political science, psychology) where he is not  terribly well read, and again, like many academics form the hard sciences  he tends to view the social sciences as something you can just handle  intuitively. Thus his views on matters of economics and policy tend to be  the kind you get from enthusiastic college sophmores. He can't admit that  someone could hold views opposed to his and still be a decent person;  anyone who disagrees with him is basically evil. But that's par for course  when you spend much of your life in academia.<br /><br />Still, it's an interesting  collection, and there are a few gems scattered amidst the dross. His A-life  introduction is imaginative and particularly well done. My advice: Skip the  hardcover and get the paperback.e paperback.	2000-02-03

It's also a tremendously entertaining and fascinating book for woodworkers, tool junkies, fans of  technology and gear heads everywhere. The photographs are beautiful, the  text is a perfect example of the kind of fine writing Taunton Press is  known for, and the history of the Black and Decker Workmate alone is reason  enough to buy this book.	1999-12-10

His non-fiction prose comes closest to McPhee's in engaging the reader and making the most minute detail seem fascinating.<br />Aside from the pure  pleasure of reading, &quot;House&quot; is also a manual for how and how not  to build a house.

The short chapters document the building of a house  in passing, true, but they also tell the stories of Donald and Eldon, a  pair of brothers whose farms neighbored Glynn's; Harlow, who shot cows when  he didn't take his medicine; and numerous other local people and  places.<br />In passing, you do learn a bit about timber framing, woodworking  tools and other construction lore, but it's really the story of Glynn and  the town he picked to build his house in.

It covers the political decisions, the engineering, the people, and the history.  The engineering is explained in a clear and non-condescending way that  non-technical people can understand, and yet it's thorough enough to  interest scientists and engineers as well. The detailed descriptions of the  various technical and political debates, as well as the struggles between  divisions of NASA and various contractors are well documented with many  different sources consulted.<br />With the current resurgence of interest in  Apollo and the reissue of a number of lesser books, it's a great pity this  book has not been reissued.	1999-08-10

Morrison and Tsipis are both well known and well regarded in physics and les sso in the realm of politics,  and not at all in economics. Their solution for conflict and poverty  assumes that every individual on the planet is, like themselves, a kind  hearted, well-intentioned individual who will readily put their self  interest aside for the betterment of others. Would that it were so.<br />But  it's not, and Morrison and Tsipis' naive utopian formula is no different  from a thousand other utopian prescriptions. At best, they're ineffectual,  and at worst, they lead to opression and dictatorship.

He sees racism as the main factor motivating the move to the suburbs, but the emigration he's talking  about long preceeded the riots of the 1960s, and the general climate of  fear that accelerated the flight.  The destitute, racially polarized inner  cities that now help motiovate suburban flight were in large part created  by the fiscal policies of the cities themselves.<br />The biggest factor has  always been fiscal policy. The high tax rates of the cities, which were  raised even higher as the tax base fled, served to give people a very good  reason for leaving. Example: Here in Detroit, city residents pay a 3%  income tax in addition to one of the highest property tax rates in the  state. That's not uncommon.<br />Detroit's population has been falling for  years, and in recent years the flight has been that of middle-class black  residents, who leave for the same reasons as their white predecessors. As  the surrounding communities have seen taxes go up with  increased property  values, flight continues out beyond the old suburbs to the new suburban  communities.<br />Another reason has been the enginnered destruction of the  stable neighborhoods in the central cities by government. In Detroit,  neighborhoods were razed to create a block of empty land to sell cheaply to  GM. In New York and elsewhere, stable neighborhoods were bulldozed by  social engineers like Robert Moses to build horrible project housing. These  further accelerated the decay of the city and the desire to leave.<br />No  doubt racism has always been a factor, but the actual story has always been  more complex that Suarez's simple tale.	1999-05-13

But to have your memory trivialized by such a hack  must have him spinning in his grave. But Albom knows his market, and he  knows there's a never ending demand among the insecure for shallow, overly  sentimental books that pull on the heartstrings, and he's delivered just  that. The sales numbers certainly support that.<br />If you need inspiration,  there are better books, and not all of them are written at the fourth grade  level.	1999-04-05

Peebles may be a bit shy on the technical details, but he has documented  the history of the U2, SR-71, F-117 and other, lesser-known craft very  well. He also does an excellent job of piecing together and tracing the  origins of various legends and rumors that are passed around as if they  were fact, like the mythical &quot;Aurora&quot; aircraft.<br />One small  detail: In the SR-71 section Peebles refers to the problem of titanium  panels being corroded by &quot;pencil marks&quot;, and the footnote  identifies the source as a public lecture. Ben Rich's book, &quot;Skunk  Works&quot;, states that it was &quot;Pentel&quot; pen ink that was the  problem.

Most simply do a lot of hand waving  (&quot;then suddenly the universe expands many times...&quot;) and then  tell you what the inflationary model buys you.<br />Guth, however, not only  provides a a clear and intuitive explanation of inflation, he gives you the  history of the idea as well. He explains *why* iinfaltion occurs, and  illustrates the notion of phase change using everyday world occurances. He  explains ideas like negative energy fields in a marvelously clear way that  allow the non-mathematical reader to get a clear understanding of the  actual physics. And if that weren't enough, he gives interesting profiles  of the various scientists whose work led to inflation- and he's generous  with giving credit where credit is due.<br />If you're tired of the  superficial treatment of cosmology given by popular writers like Timothy  Ferris, but you're not quite ready to dig into Annalen der Physik, this is  the book for you. Clear, consise and entertaining.	1998-11-30

But he's not a  scientist, and his understanding of a lot of the topics he's writing about  just aren't very deep. Reading Ferris you get a very good picture of the  sceintists he writes about but you're left with little understanding of the  science.<br />For example: He describes gravity as a warping of space-time-  good so far- but then talks about an apple &quot;falling downhill in  space-time&quot;, i.e., he simply begs the question. His example of how  compressing matter raises its temperature never touches on why this is the  case, and to top it off he gives you an incorrect illustration- that of a  penny placed on a railroad track, squashed by a passing train. Oops, sorry  Tim, the penny is *not* compressed. It's distorted, yes, but the density  remains essentially the same. His doppler illustration starts off well  enough- but then he just sort of waves his hands and says light works the  same way. How's that?<br />And that's the pattern you get in the book. The  educated reader is constantly left dangling with terms and major concepts  unexplained or glossed over. Sometimes it's downright sloppy. The reader is  increasingly left with the feeling that Ferris is just repeating ideas he  himself doesn't understand too well.<br />The end result is that when you  finish one of Ferris' books, you realize that you've been entertained, but  you haven't really learned anything. If you really want to learn about  modern physics and cosmology, get a book by a physicist like Kip Thorne or  John Gribben, to name two of the better writers. You'll have to think a bit  harder, but you'll be learning from someone who really understands the  issues and the science.	1998-08-24

The editor has taken and annotated gems from nearly 100 years of publication of this eminant journal, including some very amusing and ultimately pointless debates between a number of eminant Victorians. There are some useful inquiries as well; Francis Galton, having his portrait painted for the umpteenth time, begins a study of the number of brushstrokes used my the artist, and eventually concludes that the number of strokes in a given portrait seems to be consistent between artists and independant of style. Various writers suggest mneumonics for memorizing the significant digits of pi- in various langauges, and various meters.<br />On the more serious side, there is much discussion of the treatment of war wounds at the time of the Great War, quite a lot of debate about Prof! .

Freeze presents a history text full of nonsensical attempts to revive some of the most outlandish claims about the USSR.<br />For example, one chapter's author denies that the starvation of the Ukraine was ordered by Stalin, despite documentary evidence; another claims that only 10,000 at most died in the Great Terror (most historians put it at more like 10,000,000, or a number about equivalent to the number than died from the direct effects of WWII).<br />There are many better books, beginning with Robert Conquest's &quot;The Great Terror&quot;.	1998-08-03

After meeting faculty and graduates of our school of education, I was equally shocked- but I began to understand.<br />Kramer shows through example how the inmates have taken over the asylum in too many of today's schools of education. Run by people with little academic depth, and having degrees from other diploma-mill Ed schools, today's typical school of education is a sociological program run amuck. Priority is given to vacuuous notions of instilling self-worth while teaching content is thought to be of secondary importance- if it's given any thought at all.<br />The education industry today is more of a closed shop than the auto industry. You can't teach in public schools without an Ed degree, but no spoecialized knowledge is needed at all. Gym teachers can teach physics, but PhDs cannot. Read this book.	1998-07-31

It consists for the most part of brief reviews of the works of various authors, alphabetically indexed, along with pointers to the works of other authors whose style or content are similar, or whom the authors feel would be a logical progression.<br />The predjudice is towards more recent authors, and Engilish ones, not surprising given that this is after all an English book. Jerome K. Jerome is here, though not Christpher Morley; Ruth Prawler Jhabvala, but not Harper Lee.<br />Despite the limitations (and any book of only 366 pages, including index, is of necessity a limited surey of literature) this is a useful guide to reading as well as a useful tool for discovering new authors.	1998-07-13

Her contrast of the Marxian and Hegelian views show us both the continuing attraction of Marxism as well as its fatal flaws, and make us understand why a 160 year old debate is still relevant.<br />In an age where discourse is often reduced to televised shouting matches, the half-baked opinions of celebrities and carefully crafted statements matched to opinion poles, read Himmelfarb to re-discover what intelligent argument and essays can and should be.	1998-06-29

As it's still in print, it must still have some attraction to readers.  I decided, then, to reread it to see if I'd missed anything in my initial dismissive review.<br /><br />This book begins with a real bomb-thrower of a title- \\"The End of Science.\\" It's not posed as a question, but as an assertion. \\"Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age.\\" Is this truly the \\"twilight of the scientific age?\\" Horgan has set for himself a difficult task; how well does he manage to support what he asserts?<br /><br />Horgan begins his tale with a series of apocryphal stories about previous prediction of science reaching its limits, and refutes all of them as either incorrect or untrue. Interesting, but not really much support to his claim. Chapter 2 gets in to the meat of the matter with a series of interviews with three of the most important philosophers of science of the 20thC: Thomas Kuhn, Karl Popper, and Paul Feyerabend.<br /><br />Horgan's profile of Popper is, in a word, condescending. He presents a portrait of the great man in his old age, and uses aspect of Popper's personality, as he sees it, to discredit Popper's philosophical positions- which Horgan doesn't really understand. At one point, Horgan asks Popper if his \\"Falsifiability\\" principle does not, in fact, fall prey to itself. Is the principle of falsifiability itself falsifiable? It's a foolish question, and Popper points this out to Horgan, but Horgan doesn't get it. Falsifiability is a test that one applies to a question, or a hypothesis, to see if it's amenable scientific inquiry, and it's a very simple one: Does the hypothesis contain a rule that would enable someone to test it, and then reject it? That's very simple on its face, but it's deceptively powerful. The falsifiability principle accomplishes what Logical Positivism could not- it provides a self-consistent rule for distinguishing those hypotheses that can be tested from those which cannot. It is not in and of itself a measure of truth, which is what Horgan appears to be looking for. It is rather more of a principle that enables us to see whether of not we're asking a question that can be meaningfully answered. Horgan is similarly dismissive of the rest of Popper's work, and even accuses him of Platonism- an off charge, considering that Popper's magnum opus, \\"The Open Society and its Enemies\\" is devoted to a rejection of Platonism.<br /><br />Horgan's next visit is with Thomas Kuhn, author of the seminal The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Horgan is similarly dismissive of Kuhn, and again commits the error of attempting to critique a work outside of its historical context. When Kuhn's book was published in 1962, it was a revolutionary work that challenged the then widely accepted notion of science as an agglutinative process that built new knowledge upon past knowledge. In the fifty years since its publication it has been widely criticized, commented on, discussed and often rejected, but it it still recognized as an important work that opened up the field of Philosophy of Science. To use those arguments as a way to attack Kuhn for not having a complete philosophy of science today is childish.<br /><br />Horgan treats Paul Feyerabend, the philosophical bomb thrower of the 1970s, with a good deal more respect, despite the fact that Feyerabend's thesis was that there is no method to science. The reader gets the feeling that Horgan was more charmed than convinced by Feyerabend.<br /><br />The rest of the book consists of short visits with various scientists, most of whom seemed to refute his hypothesis more than support it. A discussion of complexity and the work of Mandelbrot, Pirgogine, the Santa Fe institute and others is a perfect example of the emergence of a brand new kind of science- a Kuhnian revolution, of you like- that expands the boundaries of science, and opens up previously unexamined or unrecognized phenomena. Horgan doesn't see this; he seems to side with those who called chaos and complexity studies \\"ironic science\\", and argued that the result of such inquiries was that thy made the world less knowable, less transparent. But that's not the case at all, any more than the probabilities in quantum theory imply that we know less about the universe  than we did in the Newtonian era.<br /><br />While Horgan presents a number of interesting tidbits in his visits with philosophers and scientists he never really makes a convincing argument about the limits of human inquiry.  For every Chomsky who believes that we are reaching the limits of human creativity and knowledge there are a hundred others who are expanding the range of scientific inquiry.  Consider this brief list of finding since the first publication of this book: The accelerating expansion of the Universe (1998). Mapping the human genome (2001). Creation of stem cells from skin cells (2007). Confirmation of the Higgs boson (2012). Each of these has resulted in an explosion of new knowledge, new research, and in the case of the accelerating expansion universe, a revolution in an existing, mature, field of inquiry.<br /><br />In the end, then, this is an interesting read, but not a very rewarding one.omena.

Neill's Summerhill, I was moved by what I saw as a brilliant and innovative  solution to the problems of public school as I saw it. The intervening years, some research and a few degrees in psychology showed me something entirely  different.<br /> Neill's Summerhill was not exactly what he portrayed it to be; some students flourished there, and many did not. The same sort of petty schoolyard bullying and favoritism that occurs in any school went on at Summerhill. Neill was very much a typical utopian socialist who, like many before him, started with a theory and refused to let experience shape it.<br />  Summerhill was the right environment for some of Neill's students, but it was by no means the right environment for all of them. While some flourished there, many spent years without obtaining any education whatsoever. The overall philosophy of a child-centered education is a good one, but letting the child decided what and when to learn is not a good preperation for the adult world, where we can't all be petulant children all the time.<br />  So read Summerhill as a philosophy of how to love your child, or what a caring family could be like, or even as a utopian fantasy. There's much good in it. But don't take Neill's claims at face value.	1998-04-24

At the time the book was written, the Soviet show trials were still in the news, and Orwell- a lifelong socialist who still distrusted most socialists- saw in the Soviet trials what could happen to England. 1984 was then written as a warning to the British of what Orwell felt their world was coming to.<br />  Today's readers should keep in mind that the world Orwell warned about was not a fantasy world, but aside from the techology of the Telescreen,  very much a real picture of the Soviet Union of the 30s. When government officials start talking about controlling the Internet, and restricting communication between people, or wanting to hold onto everyone's encryption keys, think of 1984.	1998-04-24
