What I found most charming about this &quot;How-To&quot; book was that it wasn't chirpy, wasn't preachy, didn't have a whiff of unreality arising from its advice, and was eminently practical. The only crime writing manual so far that I have picked up, browsed in, bought, took home and actually finished reading from cover to cover (sometimes doing the reading on a bus, that's how gripping it is). Recommended.	2003-08-07

This gives a nuanced and sensitive account of the Irish background from which Beckett at first painfully extracted himself to a new life in France, but which he was always attached to sentimentally and creatively, never being too busy to meet with a young writer from Ireland, or to drink with old Irish friends and wax nostalgic about the Liffey. This book, while generally very admiring (Cronin has no time for the last novel), is actually more discerning and knowledgeable about Beckett's affairs emotional, literary and dramatic, especially in the later years of his career when Cronin was one of the first to write about him at length in the TLS and elsewhere, as well as to meet him and ask questions such as, \\"Krapp seems to think he had the possibility of happiness...?\\" To which Beckett calmly replied, \\"That doesn't mean he did though, does it?\\"<br />You get a fair sense of the man and his times, and a more modulated sense of his slow climb to success, even after \\"Waiting for Godot\\" made his name. Never has fame seemed less romantic. Cronin is that best of acquaintance-biographers - no fool, but not an assassin either. Fun as well as thorough. I can't think what will come to light to make a better biography possible.	2003-05-27

Mahon's several pieces on McNeice make that out of fashion figure of interest to the non-Irish and non afficionado. There is a fun profile of Anthony Burgess and much memorabilia of literary youth at Trinity etc. There is everywhere an urbane sense of what the literary life is and how such and such a writer may have come to such or such a bad end or occasional lapse. Solid book reviews which are rewarding to dip into and a civilised, gentle tone throughout. How many essay collections can you say that of?	2003-02-24

Schmidt's paternal conference has the air of \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" as the painter Charles's father wonders aloud what became of a cousin who had run through his allowance early, gone off to Australia perhaps? Wherever possible in his account of the poets from Langland and Gower to his own stable of Khalvatis and Cissons Schmidt tries to give the impression that he was there, in spirit if not in person, and it is his identification of publishers' base motives not less than poets' fleeting visions which conspire to make this not so much a critical sourcebook as a story of how English poetry wound its roots into a tree.<br /><br />Of the eighteenth century Tory publisher and clubman Tonson, whose Kit Kat club saw writers gathering with him to eat superb pies, he remarks that it was clever of him to gather writers round him so that he could pick off their completed works like berries ripened off the bush. It is just possible, he allows, that writers and publisher actually enjoyed each other's company socially. Of the printer who bought out Milton's copyright from his widow for an additional eight pounds after a total payment of fifteen, he observes that this was a good buy. The fathers of poets are viewed by Schmidt companionably as \\"men of substance\\", if they have wealth, and the sorry ends of poets who do not have such means or a career besides come to seem regular as passing calendar leaves. Spenser's work went up in flames, he ended very poor. Charlotte Mayhew, a favourite of Hardy's, consigned to a friend the copy of her poem taken in that great man's hand, and drank bleach. These, as well as the publishers' copyists, scribes and outgoings for paper are the cost of eloquence: a life in foolscap.<br /><br />What emerges from the trawl of centuries is a generalism not common in this age of political axe grinders for critics: Schmidt sees that the ageing rebel turned conservative Wordsworth (\\"the silent muser had become the comfortable talker\\") echoes across  centuries the radical turned arch-conservative Eliot, both critics in their age who turned their backs on ground broken. A half page on the dogs at poets' sides and what they tell us of their owners - Pope, Byron, Elizabeth Barret - is a gem. The readings of the poets are quirky but often fair: Browning left nine tenths of his work not worth re-reading, but that leaves a tenth that stands, a huge amount. Donne gets a quick seeing to - too clever and abstruse - Raleigh, with his deathbed nerves of steel, is \\"a man of flesh and blood\\". More often than not it is a chain of well chosen adjectives that makes Schmidt's prosecution or defense briefly and irrefutably - Johnson, despite his sloth, had \\"put so many projects into motion\\" that he achieved them, Dryden was happy to be top of his heap and did not \\"struggle with himself\\" to get higher. He quotes the great critics and sources so regularly - Aubrey, Wharton, Hazlitt, Eliot - that the intrusion of an occasional croney of his own - Cissons, Donald Davies - draws you up short. We had come to believe Schmidt was ensconced there in the Mermaid Tavern, what does this latter day vaingloriousness here? In these bowings to others' views he sometimes loses his tone - at his best he either lifts great critical cases outright or makes his own gruff motions to the jury, often digging up a soul long lost to view in the dungeons of posterity's Old Bailey.<br />It is a vast book. I have still not reached the twentieth century, though those I've browsed of the contemporary listings do not retain his scabrous touch. Pity. He leaves to other publisher-writers the honour of regaling us with tales of chicanery in his own poets' contracts. Or he reveres too much his comfortable perch with them to risk scaring his own poets from his own pie shop. Still. It's not possible to skip while reading through his earlier centuries. His greatest achievement is to make English poetry live like a story you do not wish to miss parts of - you never know when Burns will echo Piers Ploughman, you do not know when Schmidt's map, like a three dimensional model, will let you see the Pearl poet peeping up at the bottom of the sea beneath a fishing trip by some contemporary craft.still not reached the twentieth century, though those I've browsed of the contemporary listings do not retain his scabrous touch.

The opening poem wanders in a present life but closes inexorably in the past, with his father's hand pushing back hair from a hospital bed-ridden mother's \\"desperate face\\" and \\"the way love looks, its harrowing clarity.\\"<br />It is not clear what did for her, \\"A Blow to the Head\\" one long mid-career sequence calls it, but the emotional shut-down of the mother, her eyes that \\"refuse to recognise..and turn away\\", leave a residue in all the things Motion considers and it is grief where he finds full throated voice.<br /><br />There are syntactical, grammatical infelicities in the earlier poems - \\"the more I think back to your house/I grew up in\\" - which jarrs and the poems have been revised for this volume and such blips are absent from later poems so I wonder why these are still here. But grief, even in the guise of another person's feelings, another person's excuses for grief, spills most strongly from the poems, even if it's grief for an animal which suddenly arises, compassion disguised as a social comedy in the late poem \\"The Spoilt Child\\" and its abandoned, wounded dog. And it is grief which Motion becomes more articulate, more debonaire in handling over the course of these books, grief, which is the cost of things.<br />Dramatic monologues and historical pastiches are a strong suit - these miniature novels often cram the sketch of a whole life consummately into a page or five. But the theme's the same: in \\"Independence\\" the long saga of a career and courtship in the Punjab and its aftermath only becomes more than history book clippings when the character loses and mourns his wife:<br />\\"collapsing dresses into tea chests,/scooping up the baby things, /your belts, a thrown-down petticoat... So much of you to find!\\" Which story ends with the Motion speaker's usual emotional pitch when not spurred into mournful song: \\"Sun is no more/than a white, widening slit. The sea/ a blank horizon returning to grey.\\"<br />There is great temptation with the biographer of Larkin, let alone another Laureate-in-waiting, to compare his work with that master's - but only here and there does he strike a Larkinesque attitude - very successfuly. The poem \\"Hull\\" acknowledges Larkin before the speaker, at the end of the affair, looks out of the flat of his soon to be abandoned lover at the plant house below where strangers \\"nod to each other through floppy-tongued leaves\\" and a minah bird will say nothing \\"except- if you scare him badly enough - his name.\\" The little humour piece \\"It is an Offence\\" discusses the defecation of the neighbour's whippet  (\\"surprisingly slow for a whippet\\") with similarly Larkinesque clipped moans.<br /><br />But it is the two animal stories I like best - \\"The Dancing Hippo\\" where Motion ably ventriloquises a circus manager and the trainer of a hippo who after learning to dance (\\"that we thought nothing/but seemed to them a miracle\\") is burnt to death. In his grief the trainer burst into the manager's van: \\"I know it was useless, of course, her dancing./I know. But God above it was beautiful!/Beautiful! God! - or something like that.\\" Motion here is a master of the foreign voice, the colourful detail and does not show an inch too much of the borrowed gaberdine.<br />And then there is \\"Reading the Elephant\\" where another mourning spouse of sorts is \\"turning time back on itself\\" on Safari in Africa where he tries to get back to the beginning of things: \\"They never last long, these moments. With half a chance/We drop back to life as it is. I understand that./I'm not quite a fool. So to keep myself airborne I always/snapped open some book (some parachute) just as my trance/was ending...\\" then he gets stared out by an elephant coming upon him suddenly, to leave him \\"with everything clear.\\" And so Motion actually is, a mind ready to fall back into distances and literary fugues unless it is jerked to by that death or other dangers which always recall that death, still holding him fast  \\"standing on a frozen pond/entranced by someone else below the ice\\" (\\"Dead March\\"), and it is only the death of a friend, Ruth Haddon, and her elegy \\"Fresh Water\\" which can end in some second hand peace as he imagines her drowned form leaving the sunk ship, The Marchioness, \\"swimming back upstream, her red velvet party dress/flickering round her heels as she twists through the locks\\" back to the source of the Thames, the \\"wet mouth of the earth\\" where she vanishes, his mother.is jerked to by that death or other dangers which always recall that death, still holding him fast  \\"standing on a frozen pond/entranced by someone else below the ice\\" (\\"Dead March\\"), and it is only the death of a friend, Ruth Haddon, and her elegy \\"Fresh Water\\" which can end in some second hand peace as he imagines her drowned form leaving the sunk ship, The Marchioness, \\"swimming back upstream, her red velvet party dress/flickering round her heels as she twists through the locks\\" back to the source of the Thames, the \\"wet mouth of the earth\\" where she vanishes, his mother.	2003-02-10

The device is simple - Berger starts with the career of one obscure comic and follows it, weaving in and around it the careers of endless other comics - an initially obscure Lenny Bruce among them - and the book just goes on in one long series of anecdotes and bits and gags to tell the history of the business from mid-century or so and towards the present day. The book has a slightly antiquated, out of date feel to it - it's definitely about the era that preceded today's comics and the people they watched on TV - but it does capture something of the DRIVE of these people and their compulsiveness. Not a book to browse, a book to listen to like a long, long monologue. Full of the sweat of comics long ago shut down and gone to Florida to sell aluminium siding. Yes - that's one of the good things about this book - it's not a glam bio and tells it like it usually was - long, and difficult and here and there quite funny as well as painful.	2003-02-07

It is a masterpiece, and known widely as such, but what surprised me on hearing it was how the book I'd remembered as terribly romantic was actually rather clear-eyed and dark. My wife, who had never read it, listened spell-bound, and at the end burst into tears at the sadness of it. A word about Scourby as reader - he is restrained but emotional, captures the personality of each character with a slightly different tone, and - most importantly for me - brings out the fact that the closing pages, which are often quoted out of context as deeply romantic, are in fact painfully cynical, a voice of disenchantment about the cost of America, not its promise. A masterpiece on the page and on tape. Can't recommend it too highly.	2003-01-25

The interviewee observed of a series of his activities that in each case, \\"In the beginning you think, This is going to make me..hard! And that's the greatest rush I've ever had, ..finding something new and different to make me..hard beats them all.\\" Then follows, inevitably, the stage when he asks, \\"Can I eat doing this? Can I make a living at it? Because, if I can, then I'll be in heaven. I'll have made it to the place I want to be.\\"But, he observes, \\"It doesn't work that way..It doesn't work that way because, eventually, the second part of the equation takes over and, no matter what you're doing, you're doing it for the business of it and the concerns about making a living are the same, no matter what the job is.\\"<br />This is a well written, thoughtful collection of essays about the concerns of any artist. It is also refreshingly free of the usual pretension that accompanies such musings when engaged in by poet, painters etc. Pornographers are more fun between the sheets, as well as between the sheets.	2003-01-06

The letters, occasionally one or two letters to give a sense of an important author's life, literally do give you a brief glimpse into a living life - like one of those apartment windows Edward Hopper paints, or views seen fleetingly from a train - these letters open up a life to you, often at a moment of great crisis - Alexander Pope's formal letter mourning the death of a friend bursts out uncontrollably despite his reserve at the turn of a line - and sometimes they are quiet letters, saying not much at all except how the picnic was and the very texture of life is given in a half a page. The Kermodes have given, in their dual editorship, a wider spectrum than I believe any one editor's personality and tastes could have plumbed. A book to return to again and again, rediscovering authors whose collected letters you might go and try to find. A book for always finding new friends in, or re-assessing authors you thought you knew in the light of what they wrote a lover, or a friend, when no-one was reading what they read but their own love.	2002-12-23

What frost is on the air, not in the hand or ear that hears crunching?<br />\\"Half-alive is too dull<br />for words; will make no mark on blank paper.\\"<br />Many of these poems are half alive, capturing the mind for a moment, then letting go. A sequence called \\"The Arctic Chart\\" circles around the different and often tragic expeditions to find the North-West passage, then find the remains of lost expeditioners. Many are sketches of individual tempraments, flaring into immediacy in odd images:<br />\\"When you saw the winter ice break<br />with a great, rippling wave, like a carpet<br />shaken out...\\"<br />This is dazzling but has nothing to do with the individual Dr. Kane who elicits the poem, the subject is Pugh's own lesser life and exploration, and the immediacy of the domestic image betrays the fact that she knows nothing of the subject - it only comes alive when translated back to her more prosaic frame. A ballad called \\"Lady Franklin Bay\\" is sustained by the rhyme scheme whose narrative drive and plaintives implicity won't allow  glitz:<br />\\"He lies in the north lady,<br />where your heart came:<br />nothing belongs up there<br />so much as your name.\\"<br />As a whole, these poems convince most when they describe lost<br />love - in the Forward Prize winning \\"Envying Owen Beatty\\" it is<br />the desire to kiss the dug up dead youth from the snow, a woman<br />who hates her lover's smoking because of smoking parents<br />\\"dreams now<br />of drowning her mouth in black unbrushed<br />hair, acrid and soft as ash.\\"<br />The simplest and most controlled in its emotion is \\"Letter\\":<br />\\"Birds set out on their travels, same as ever:<br />it's nothing to them who'll miss their goodbyes,<br />written across the sky in small black letters<br />like your neat script, that will not answer this.\\"<br />Or the confession of \\"The Faithful Wife\\" who thinks<br />her passion for a gay co-worker doesn't matter till she overhears<br />his voice asking the time and<br />\\"it slammed into my guts.

Every man setting out to write about Lincoln has an idea of him, a shadow to look for Lincoln in and the huge weight of tradition and history on his back while writing. Even Nicolay and Hay, his secretaries, and authors of the voluminous collected papers which are probably the best source on the Presidency, only knew the man in office, once he had enfolded himself, if you will, inside his great ambition. Herndon knew the man. He shared his office with him, a law practise which consisted of Lincoln throwing the case notes and money  into his hat before putting it on to his head, and splitting all the money down the middle. Herndon also went around talking to everyone who knew Lincoln while he was alive before they died.<br />There are flaws to this book. Herndon drank, so Lincoln didn't take him to Washington with him. This book tells you nothing about the war, about Lincoln's policies, or even a great deal about Lincoln's debates with Douglas, say. But. And it is a great but. This is the only book that gives you a smell of the goofy, tall, funny, awkward, galumphing and generally likeable oddball that emerged as the greatest leader this country ever had. This is the only book I would advise an actor to read if he was going to undertake to play Abe Lincoln. All the other books describe a monument. This one describes a man who went on dates, told dirty jokes and had a funny way of laying his legs across the desk and reading upside down. The rest is second hand.	2002-10-07

He promptly invites black wannabe poet Embert, smelly peanut butter eating misogynist Milo and New York Times addicted Jewish loner Bernie, all likewise indigent to some extent or other, to join him. And there they sit through the winter as Embert's two-timing of his girlfriend(s), Milo and Bernie's forlorn attempts at love and Rill's slow pursuits of the beauty of the dunes around the town all work their pressuring way on the four of them. Embert is the central character, in that he changes and has goals you see achieved. The others may act, or fail to act, but finally just drift away and from the place, having been friends for a while then re-lurched back to loneliness.<br />Milo and Bernie are too narrowly differentiated and both have romantic failures because of ill-judged tirades before the objects of their desire. But there is a feel for the loneliness of the failure here, and a sense of the creeping inevitability that gradually turns a temporary lack of will into a forgone conclusion and a lonely life.<br />The style is often the laconic spit of facts and brisk characterisation found in a story told over a beer, and much of the story's action is set in specific taverns and coffee shops, teeny apartments and chichi boutiques that the resident or visitor to Provincetown may find nostalgically charming. Visitors and tourists, sometimes on sexual safari, are economically and shrewdly sketched, the scene of Embert's being blithely propositioned by a rich tourist boasting of her husband's prowess in bed particularly well done.<br />The town is viscerally evoked, and the prose occasionally bursts up into a flourish of leaf rattling, like a great mass of gold leaves suddenly in cry - as in the scene when Obsidian makes a bid too far for grandeur and crawls off to die.<br />Good for a quiet afternoon, reading in a chair, maybe thinking of Provincetown or just the way that a given season in your life and a few friends you knew may just have been a time of opportunity never seen again.ddenly in cry - as in the scene when Obsidian makes a bid too far for grandeur and crawls off to die.<br />Good for a quiet afternoon, reading in a chair, maybe thinking of Provincetown or just the way that a given season in your life and a few friends you knew may just have been a time of opportunity never seen again.	2002-10-06

A selection like this, made by a friend of the dying translator by rifling of his life's filing cabinet of occasional translations, could easily fail. What Levin notes, however, in his introduction and selections, was a lonely tone which the translator Friend responded to and echoed in some Hebrew poets: \\"The simple talk of my home...would never  be a simple matter - a position Friend knew all too well.\\" These translations succeed where the Brooklyn born Friend, in Israel for \\"fifty years in a language and culture that were never quite his own\\", reflected Hebrew poets' tones of dislocation and loss. Failure arose from the same source, when his dislocation from a living English idiom lent a stiltedness to some colloquial Hebrew poets.<br /><br />His Bialik translations, though he didn't care for Bialik,  withstand examination by other Bialik lovers: \\"Once again, dreaming a giant dream/men hasten to their little sins.\\" A crisp, elegant rendering. Likewise his versions of Rachel: \\"A true pact is ours, a tie time cannot dissever/Only what I have lost is what I possess forever.\\" He can make these modern Hebrew poets sound like eighteenth century London wits. But with the colloquial and contemporary Amichai he stumbles: \\"All the generations that preceded me contributed me/in small amounts...\\" Here \\"contributed me\\" echoes the Hebrew locution in a way not possible in English and the chattiness of the original stiffens to alien brocade. Friend succeeds where a not quite twentieth century \\"poetic\\" English is appropriate, fails where conversational tone is required.<br />No small part of this book's appeal and usefulness as a general introduction are Levin's laconic, evocative biographical notes: Gabriel Preil, born in Estonia, settled to write Hebrew poetry in the United States and \\"died while on a visit to Jerusalem, awaiting the publication of his Collected Poems\\". Lonely souls translated by a lonely voice, far in time and spirit from contemporary English and its streetsmart verse.le on a visit to Jerusalem, awaiting the publication of his Collected Poems\\".

US	46840761	R1B8W3SV4PNVOC	037570731X	22798973	The Ladies' Man	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Ladies Man At Bay	Elinor Lipman is concerned with second chances. In her previous romance, The Way Men Act, she described the slow and accidental  re-union of a divorcee with the high school flame she never wed. In The Ladies' Man she puts this basic question of whether it's  possible to go back in a more complicated frame. Harvey Nash, the professional romancer of the title, follows the trade of commercial jingles composer and returns to Boston fleeing his West coast live-in lover, Dina, whose modeling career has given way to a commercial practice massaging feet. The woman he abandoned, failing to turn up to their engagement party thirty years earlier, is Adelle Dobbin, also encumbered - by two sisters, Lois and Kathleen, both also single. It is Lipman's endeavour to explore not only the damage which Harvey's breach of faith did to the marriageability of all three, but also how his re-appearance in their lives unexpectedly jarrs them back into motion, a bowling ball among the cob-webbed skittles.<br />Adelle fundraises for non commercial TV, Lois (the middle one) works for the Employment Office and Kathleen owns a lingerie boutique whose doorman, Lorenz, she flirts with and finally dates in the flurry of Harvey's return. (He arrives at midnight, flirts with all three in turn, and moves Kathleen to break a casserole over his head.) The doorman's building also contains Cynthia John, a financial consultant Harvey seduces on the plane East, who throws a music recital to show him off (a masterful scene of music snobs volte facing into success worshipping applause at Harvey's one ubiquitous coffee ad refrain). The initial charm and inexplicability of Harvey's relentless boyish seduction is gradually stripped away by Lipman's gaze - he emptied Dina's bank account on the way from LA but calls her to forward the residual payment cheques which are his only income. The scene of Nash Harvey (his professionally reversed name) inspecting the dilapidated parental home he first left Boston to flee, reduced to staying there rent free if he is to stay at all, is quietly fierce, as is the scene of Adelle breaking down in the changing room of her sister's shop: \\"Dell, are you alright?\\" \\"No,\\" she says softly. But these scenes are always harnessed to comedy, as Harvey's vengeful ex Cynthia walks into the store, as Adelle's remembered one sexual encounter was with a randy academic whose pedagogic urge leads him to view his member as a teaching aide. These scenes are ruefully funny, a bitter undercurrent to the frothy shake of Lipman's style, making her books a smooth but satisfying brew.<br /><br />Lipman's gems in this book are the minor characters: Lorenz the doorman's traditional father who thinks Kathleen is too good to sleep around with and won't vacate the apartment, Adelle's shy station boss admirer Marty whose sexual harassment paranoia and self-doubts she deftly hits, the boyish deputy Sherrif brother Richard Dobbin, whose reflexive picking up on waitresses is a less exploitative counterpart to Harvey, part of Lipman's ongoing project shaking her head at men's odd ways. Her one failure is Byron Sprock, the passing playwright Dina conjugates with, whose  glibness is too close to Harvey's with no grain of depth, perhaps why Dina wants to get her ladies' man returned. The exquisite handling of the plot's spinning plates never let you feel much will ever fall out of hand, but Lipman's acid eye won't let you think she's been too kind or glib while sending Harvey on his way. Stern in its judgements but kind to its readers and characters, it is a wise and easy book to read.reduced to staying there rent free if he is to stay at all, is quietly fierce, as is the scene of Adelle breaking down in the changing room of her sister's shop: \\"Dell, are you alright?\\" \\"No,\\" she says softly.

My personal favourite \\"Something Crazy\\" illustrates the necessary conditions of the form:<br /> The man with the blue hat<br /> doesn't come back anymore.<br /> He stopped a long time ago.<br /> Before I got married. Before the kids came.<br /> Nobody looks at me like that anymore.<br />  ...<br /> I was young then, understand?<br /> Nobody ever looked at me before.<br /> I even dreamed that he might take me<br /> to my highschool dance, imagine.<br /> Waitresses have come and gone,<br /> I've stayed on.<br />The speaker is stationary, in the restaurant where she works- the man in the blue hat is already a thing of the past when the poem opens. She loves him because he is the ONLY thing that ever came along that loved her or that she could love. In its tone and perfection this poem reminds one of the torch-song as perfected by Billy Holiday. As in that genre the speaker stands alone and sings of a love, an overwhelming passion, almost always in the past. What is present is the pain- and the understatement of the pain and the ability through an embrace of the nostalgia of love to transcend it for a moment in a reach for remembered happiness, and recalled warmth despite the present cold. This is the tension of the genre. The speaker is pinned, unable to leave their grief, but attempts to transcend it in a song.<br /><br />It is the formula, arguably, of any powerful dramatic song or poem- the speaker in pain. But the formula always depends upon the absence of a choice- these people are dramatic because fate has placed them where they are and they could not, whether they wish to or not, be anywhere else.<br />The title poem of \\"My Wicked Wicked Ways\\" picks up on the author's Don Juan Dad, tags him with the mixed mockery (not least self-mockery) and affection of Errol Flynn's autobiography title- and makes the best of a painful reality by recycling this family condition- as best she can- into her own bravura stance. In the poem's photo of a young married couple the father's coming affairs are not yet seen, and neither is the nature of the baby in her mother's arms:<br /> She does not know yet<br /> I will turn out bad.<br />The stance which will emerge is that of the \\"bad\\" girl, the \\"Loose Woman\\", the one who loves 'em and leaves 'em when fate or, crucially, a pose of independence, requires. I say that this stance is a pose or theatrical attitude because I find the poems of heartache and loneliness much more convincing.<br />In \\"Loose Woman\\", the follow up collection, the stance overwhelms the tragedy, in this book the song is sung blue and pure. Very few weak poems here. A selection that stings your throat like a shot of tequila. An album you'll put on your turn table again and again.anywhere else.<br />The title poem of \\"My Wicked Wicked Ways\\" picks up on the author's Don Juan Dad, tags him with the mixed mockery (not least self-mockery) and affection of Errol Flynn's autobiography title- and makes the best of a painful reality by recycling this family condition- as best she can- into her own bravura stance.

This book shifts from the memories of a young peasant wife describing events of war, love and peace in the old country (Estonia), to an interplay with those of her husband, describing early life in the very foreign promised land (Canada), and finally returning to her voice and her life, now alone, a grandmother and pensioner lost in the Babel and silence of the big city. He is able to pull us into these materials not only with the voice of his speakers but with the emotional quality of the things they touch:<br /> We children came from anger.<br /> On a calm night my parents<br /> could elude each other, as if<br /> in a capital city, in the hut<br /> with the bleached pine floor<br /> ..Mother crushed myrtles between her fingers<br /><br />The voice arrests with its opening statement, but that authority of rhythm is backed up and given a visceral authenticity by the floor, the myrtles, the immediacy of sensory impressions. This is more than sitting in on Nurkse's grandmother telling stories- this is listening in to a girlfriend from the old country sharing the family intimacies over shared washing, this is a re-creation of a past habit of life.<br />Not least of the book's pleasures is the insight it shares into the nature of marriage, as viewed by two fairly hard-headed people who live difficult lives in hard circumstances and survive not only in body but in the created body between them. Here the husband and wife speak:<br /> This preacher's daughter claims to love me<br /> in darkness and in church, and she can prove it...<br /> She doesn't know I was already in love<br /> before she shared my bed, with those fruit trees..<br /> they were mine clear, countersigned, paid for by sweat<br /> not by love, lies, happiness or suffering.<br /><br /> The wedding sheet frayed under us<br /> so I cut it in four and sewed it back<br /> with the unworn edges at the center..<br />  ....and still each night<br /> we'd sit at the edge of the matress<br /> trembling with exhaustion and at last turn<br /> as if unwed, to that silence between us.<br /><br />Nurkse's form is rigid enough to inspire a confidence in the ear but never flashy or attention grabbing in its rhymes. One never loses the sensual impression of a speaker confiding, sometimes whispering to you. The allusions to and descriptions of music which weave through the poems are at times most powerful in the keen awareness of silence: silence of exile, silence of love and silence of death.<br />This is a fine book and I found myself trying to emulate the tricks of its voice when writing in the hour immediately after reading it: that's how affecting the voice proved. The opening section is on the whole the most lively and colourful, a certain sameness bred perhaps of fatigue creeps into some of the poems in the middle section, and I found myself wondering if Nurkse had run out of juice, writing the same poem over and over in endless movements. However, throughout each part of the book there are luminous passages, piercing details and an affecting portrait of a life, a place, a people, of a heart in love.dge of the matress<BR> trembling with exhaustion and at last turn<BR> as if unwed, to that silence between us.<BR>         <BR>Nurkse's form is rigid enough to inspire a confidence in the ear but never flashy or attention grabbing in its rhymes.

Ondaatje starts us on this road of memories from his childhood home of Sri Lanka with a series of historical anecdotes and detail, a different place where \\"We believed in the intimate life, an inner self\\" and \\"3am in temples, the hour of washing the gods\\" led to a God being dragged from temples \\"by one's own priests\\" to be buried while wars, treasure hunters and fifty year feuds went by, so that \\"roots/like the fingers of a blind monk/spread for two hundred years over his face.\\"<br /><br />In the third and most anecdotally direct, least oblique sequence the image of the dug up Buddha reappears transformed:<br />\\"In the sunless forest/of Ritagala...nine soldiers on leave/strip uniforms off/and dig a well.../In the sunless forest/crouched by a forest well/pulling what was lost out of the depth.\\" And immediately before that anecdote, in one of the achingly simple lyrics that litter this thatch of stories and semi-parables, Ondaatje tells of \\"the last Sinhala word\\" which he lost, \\"the word for water\\" and the wet nurse \\"a lost almost-mother in those years/of thirsty love\\" who he has no photograph of, has not seen since  age eleven, whose grave he can find no trace of. He now wonders who abandoned who.<br /><br />Now and then the concerns of a writer surface and you realise these are the meditations of a writer returning to buried wounds and springs to be renewed: the poets who \\"slept, famous, in palace courtyards/then hid within forests when they were hunted/..and were killed and made more famous.\\" Or in the second sequence \\"The Nine Sentiments\\", which corresponds to the nine sentiments of Indian love poetry (romantic/erotic, humorous, pathetic, angry, heroic, fearful, disgustful, amazed and peaceful - as I'm sure you knew) there comes this very modern, writerly unease: \\"Where is the forest/not cut down/for profit or literature..\\" and lines later \\"Where is there a room/without the damn god of love?\\"<br />These poems are of the haunted and of the haunting, of what you cannot escape from and when Ondaatje uses techniques of Indian poetry, even language and references you do not as a Westerner quite own, such is the sensual certainty of his grasp that you take them on faith. He will talk of what you do not know and then of \\"gold ragas of longing/like lit sequin/on her shifting green dress\\". The notes at the back did not explain what a \\"raga\\" was but, frankly, I don't need to know. I will fall under Ondaatje's daze as he recalls what was lost in his own half dreaming sleep.<br /><br />Where the poems take longest to work their magic is in the opening, where you do not have a framework of emotions to connect all these anecdotes to and the details may seem merely colourful. As the book progresses he unpacks before you both the good and the bad memories, the pains of history and personal loss and the quick, effortless watercolours capturing exotic scenes like some British traveller of the last century or the one before - of \\"women of the Boralesgamuwa\\" singing \\"songs to celebrate the washing/of arms and bangles...the three folds on their stomachs/considered a sign of beauty\\" on afternoons when they \\"try out all their ankle bracelets\\". And in some pure love lyrics  his style becomes that of the immitated so there is no more than a hair's breadth between him and the model, not a crack to see light through between him and the heights of say Arthur Waley's classic Chinese poetry translations in lines like: \\"her fearless heart/light as a barn owl/against him all night.\\"<br />A central poem of the first section starts simply with the line: \\"What we lost.\\" This he continues to catalogue in some detail as a whole way of life, of civilisation and love and ways of loving \\"burned or traded for power and wealth\\". In the closing poem \\"Last Ink\\" Ondaatje closes in on what remains:<br />\\"the dusk light, the cloud pattern,<br /> recorded always in your heart<br />and the rest of the world - chaos,<br />circling your winter boat.\\"<br />The rest, he concludes, is only love. And momentary, sought out opportunities for leaps and bowing, in the darkness.s:<br />\\"the dusk light, the cloud pattern,<BR> recorded always in your heart<br />and the rest of the world - chaos,<BR>circling your winter boat.\\"<br />The rest, he concludes, is only love.

David Goldstein's introduction recounts debates in the second century AD over whether the poems should be included in the Bible. These hinged on whether complete lack of reference to God and faith prevented their being an allegory: &quot;The many warnings by rabbinic authorities against taking the book at its face value show that such a literal reading was not uncommon, and that the temptation so to regard the book was ever-present.&quot; The formality of tone in Jay's  version makes that temptation unlikely:<br /><br />I make you swear, daughters of Jerusalem<br />if you find my lover, tell him<br />how sick I am with love.<br />(And what's your lover<br />  more than anyone else's,<br />darling?<br />  Why so special<br />for you to make us promise?)<br />He has a sparkling appearance -<br />you'd pick him out of ten thousand.<br />The line breaks sometimes evoke the spoken breath and occasional colloquialisms like &quot;darling&quot; can suggest a speaking person. But the prevailing tone, as in phrases like &quot;sparkling appearance&quot;, is  formal as an archaeologist's rendering of buried tablets, evoking neither personal involvement nor the immediacy of sensual detail. This approach best suits those lyrics in which no personal story is implied and a preacher's eloquence rather than lover's sighs seem right: &quot;for lust is as stubborn as death/as pitiless as the grave,/its glowing coals/burn with the fiercest flames.&quot;<br />The book is handsome and some of the lyrics lovely. Jay has made these poems live and speak the English of our day. But he has not translated the directness which tempted second century AD readers to mistake these poems for literal records of an earthly love.y.

The overwhelming majority are pulled off with wit and panache, some are perfect anthology pieces which should be around for a good while....The difference lies in the fact that where, for instance, Wendy Cope's humour is underlain with grief, Sophie Hannah's project reveals itself as you go further into the book to be one of all but metaphysical, ethical exploration, and her metronomic heart is that of a scientist, weighing probabilities, possibilities. This book moves from an account of how certain lovers DID behave to how they SHOULD behave, to a questioning and analysis of possibilities of emotion. In this the ruling spirit is one of wit and common sense, and beneath the homey and day-to-day properties of her stage I think she is related to those seventeenth century courtiers whose loves were always transacted in a world of costs, odds, likelihoods. ...There are occasional poems about craft, about the tunneler from prison camp who does not want to give up the tunnel merely because of liberation, and the occasional more opaque and open-ended moral piece like \\"The Man Who Wouldn't Share His Garden with a Wolf\\", and if I saw a flaw to point to it would be that Hannah's talent seems at this point to be (as Kafka noted of himself on his death-bed) \\"still going in two directions at once\\" - there are the immensely polished and ready to lap up at one reading/hearing tour de forces and then there are quieter, less certain, more exploratory and, perhaps, more thoughtful pieces - but the steady canter of the polished pieces makes one's ear less inclined to stop and re-adjust to the stranger music - it is as if John Lennon suddenly went from \\"She Loves You\\" to \\"Imagine\\" in one breath (and I don't know that Hannah is that good, I'm just drawing an analogy). I don't believe she'll have to choose between the two manners but, for me at least, the collection could have been arranged to better highlight the odder pieces, which are probably her future avenue of growth, the escape route should delivering what's expected of her become oppressive.<br /><br />The other criticism is that her language, while finely hewn, is transparent - I'm not sure if I'll recall a phrase that I could use to define some of my own emotions when next I am in one of the situations she describes. (Exception: \\"when his back turned in the bed makes one bed feel like two\\" stuck in my mind.) So her metaphors are apt and incisive, her patter funny, her intelligence unceasing and her experiments thoughtful - there's no knowing where she might go from here.to better highlight the odder pieces, which are probably her future avenue of growth, the escape route should delivering what's expected of her become oppressive.<BR> <BR>The other criticism is that her language, while finely hewn, is transparent - I'm not sure if I'll recall a phrase that I could use to define some of my own emotions when next I am in one of the situations she describes.

(Hawthorne spent much of his career as an underpaid and unsung magazine writer and some of his work went with no byline and without reprinting at his own choice, so what he wrote is no easy matter to decide.) The stories are, you probably know if you're looking up this book, stark and wonderful. But some of them are also twee and a little fanciful and not so wonderful. That too is instructive. One very useful thing about this volume is that it includes a listing of when each story first saw print in magazine form and when in book form. In that way the reader can chart Hawthorne's development as a magazine writer and a professional which in every possible sense of the word he determined to become and despite some difficult odds finally was. Some of the most beautiful and terrifying stories in the language and a beautiful object to hold in your hand. Expensive, but if you can get it - this is the one to buy.	2002-09-21
US	46840761	R2QD7J15T00IO1	0679772642	222131659	True and False: Heresy and Common Sense for the Actor	Books	3	7	11	N	N	Speak the Speech with an Attitude	An odd passage catches your eye in the first pages of True and False, which in a sense is not just Mamet's manifesto on acting and a proper way of life in the performing arts, but a manifesto as to the nature of narrative, and hence a view to most of his output. He writes: &quot;Most of us, in the course of a day or a week, treat ourselves to the fantasy of the Bad News at the Doctor's Office in which we are invited to sit and hear our fate. And in that fantasy we are stoical and simple, and that is of course what makes the fantasy so pleasing to indulge in- we wait to hear the verdict on our future bravely.&quot;<br />Now, I can't say this has ever crossed my mind daily, weekly or in the course of a year. When last given bad news by a doctor I was irritable, to say the least, and stoicism was not uppermost in my mind - my aching limbs more probably were - but to Mamet this position of a macho virtue is central.<br /><br />Mamet's principal point in True and False is that there is no magic, no emotion: &quot;The actor does not need to &quot;become&quot; the character. The phrase, in fact, has no meaning. There is no character. There are only lines upon a page. They are lines of dialogue meant to be said by the actor. When he or she says them simply, in an attempt to achieve an object more or less like that suggested by the author, the audience sees an illusion of a character upon the stage.&quot; And, later, it is back to the machismo virtue: &quot;An apprenticeship spent looking inward for supposed &quot;emotion&quot;, while perhaps spent with honest motives, trains one only to be a gull. An actor should never be looking inward. He or she must keep the eyes open to see what the other actor is doing... To face the world is brave. To turn outward rather than inward and face the world which you would have to face in any case - such may not win the day, but it will always allow you to live the day as an adult.&quot; So any of Mamet's characters, like the actor, and presumably Mamet, are all alike in their predicament - they may not be successful but they are trying to face outward, to keep their eyes open, and take it like a man.<br />What Simon Callow, one critic of Mamet's acting critique, says is that people come to the theatre to see character, on stage, not the author's lines, and it is creating character that actors are paid for. With a view to both Mamet's novel and movies, it must be said that he has a point. Now, Callow, in a book of his own, the biography of the actor Charles Laughton, distinguished actors into two schools - those of Olivier and Laughton. Olivier worked from the outside, putting together a character out of bits and bobs - a nose here, a mustache there, a pair of shoes - and &quot;swimming between these things&quot; he said, he eventually found a creature. This is acting by instinct, not really technique, though Olivier was much regarded as artificial, and Mamet, by his theory, would not approve. The other school, Laughton's, finds the character within their own voluminous parade of sins and pulls, from within their capacious trove of maladies, a timbre or attitude akin to that they find before them in the role. That too, Mamet would not approve. Mamet  sometimes presents actors with a type, with an intention and a list of objectives which - by his theory - should be enough to play with bravery - but the bravery is not a personality, it is not alive. It is not finally an expression of the individual, just a stare of fear.<br />Mamet cites, as the rewards of his career in theatre and film, a series of personal high-points: meeting Jose Ferrer (&quot;the greatest every Cyrano&quot;), walking across a room to chat up a gorgeous slim readhead with her back to him to find it was Lillian Gish, who talked to him for half an hour about &quot;Mr. Griffiths&quot;, getting advice about his first screenplay through Bob Rafaelson, the director, from Sam Rafaelson, the director's uncle and author of the first talky screenplay. These people that he mentions, that he worships, and whose respect is what he claims to work for, are personalities finally, not an attitude to fear. They are collections of tics, prevailing in the face of a general inclination to downward slide. Likewise in Wag the Dog, Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro won great acclaim for playing, respectively, an overblown Hollywood producer and a political advisor.

There is a crazy Jewish people here which keeps slightly kosher and peddles...and awaits Marxism for the people of the world. But it doesn't need Yiddish literature. We built on a paper bridge.\\"<br /><br />In a career spanning some sixty further years he did not significantly disprove his initial estimate and his troubled, complex relationship with his Jewish past both theological and familial, his aspiration and despair for the Yiddish language, his desire and contempt for the English audience through translation which was finally to be his only avenue to worldly success, all make his career an oddly emblematic one for the Jew in the twentieth century, seeking to retain an identity but selling it out at the same time. Janet Hadda's \\"Isaac Bashevis Singer, A Life\\" gives the outlines and some colour of his travails.<br />It was only when Israel Joshua died that Isaac Bashevis really came into his own, completing his first - wild, delirious, frenzied, sexual - novel about, significantly, the time of the social order shattering messiah Sabbatai Zevi, \\"Satan in Goray\\". Isaac, Hadda tells us, was a strange mixture of his weakly emotional father and coldly tough, rational mother - the grandson and son of rabbis whose father was far less suited to the role of judge and advisor than his mother. His sister, Hinde Esther, also a writer, was a turbulent, passionate, too close and perhaps sexual involvement in the home which Isaac never escaped - though he was cold and callous to her in person in later life, witholding particularly financial help in her difficult post war existance, he surrounded himself with emotional substitutes for her - mad, turbulent women - and what he did for himself he did for his fictional counterparts.<br />Again and again, in life and in fiction (the same triangle was in his modern set novels \\"Shadows on the Hudson\\" and \\"Enemies: A Love Story\\", as well as historical ones), Singer finds creative tension, the material for his output and his day to day entertainment, in a triangular state of play, the mistresses alternating, sometimes helping with translations among other duties. One of Hadda's most engaging finds, a Singer story in outline, has Singer's long suffering wife Alma coming to Israel to confront him with his mistress in a hotel. This could not go on, she said. He told her it had been going on five years. She was dumbfounded. Sensing an opening Isaac leapt in, asked her if it had really bothered her at all all of this time, and the three wound up going together to visit retirement homes that might suit the mistress's mother.<br />There is not enough of this sort of thing. Deep details of the texture and taste of this most sensual writer's life are missing, not just in the sections about the Warsaw writer's world, which justifiably will have evaded the biographer's reconstructing steps by disappearing, but also in New York, a city whose buildings are there, more often than not, and whose neighbourhoods survive, if occupied by new ethnicities, a different time. I know New York and would have welcomed a charting of this late century's Jewish odyssey up the rungs of the city's economic life and out via the career of this writer. But you cannot tell where Singer lived when he wrote which book, in Hadda's account, you can't tell where he walked. Writers, as much as bankers and bricklayers, are creatures of money and time, and what street a book was written on matters as much as its historical wellsprings. A friend of mine, living in New York in the eighties, said he'd see Singer walking some blocks regularly - he walked fast, focused, and unstoppable to where he was going. You were not going to impede this old man from going anywhere.<br /><br />Hadda's short-comings are most evident where she quotes the interview of Richard Elman, who through a few touches picked up during interview, prises open all the tensions of Singer's relationship with non-Jewish literature and life: he translated Dostoevsky's \\"The Devils\\" into Yiddish while in Warsaw and snipes at Alma to keep quiet about it, belittling her favourite German Jewish authors Wassermann and Sholem Ash and her, then smiles at Elman as if it was a game. Hadda the Yiddishist and fellow woman is unable to pick up anything like this juicy from her interviews with Alma or the remaining friends, lovers, haters. She gets from Alma that the Singer marriage was glued together by good sex and that perhaps this was the same for Singer's own mis-matched parents, but this does not compensate for a lack of sensitivity to nuance, an inability to touch the world she is painting. If Singer is as important as she believes, and he did win the Nobel Prize, sniping at his first notable translator Bellow for beating him to it, he deserves a fuller book.A friend of mine, living in New York in the eighties, said he'd see Singer walking some blocks regularly - he walked fast, focused, and unstoppable to where he was going.

His lothario alter-ego Grein's adventure when he runs off with the married daughter of a friend, Anna, sends ripples through their whole social world, in which Singer paints the moral universe of post-war American Jewery. The Yeshiva trained doctor and friend of Anna's millionaire father takes back the German wife who left him for a Nazi. The Berlin Yiddish comedian Yasha Kotik, Anna's first husband, is beastly enough to survive both the death camps and Broadway. Grein's old Warsaw friend survived the camps to make a horrendous marriage with a battleaxe in Florida who tries to swindle Anna over real estate. ... But there is no escaping the sense of scenes written to a set word count, to be read on a subway train in slow columns from a smudging rag, and there is no escaping the sense of perfunctoriness at Singer's tying up of the loose threads at the end: Grein, like many of Singer's sinning alter-egos, winds up repenting, cutting off all links to his earthly life and loves, taking up Jewish study in a yeshiva. The rest he abandons, more or less moved on, no more resolved, because really the values Singer prized cannot exist for them. The penultimate line of the novel, in a letter from Grein's cell in Jerusalem: \\"There can be no connection between a bound animal and an animal that roams free.\\" Singer was condemned to roam free, remembering a world that no longer exists and atoning for a family and life long gone, and this book does not return that world to us, though his wilder, more forlorn fiction does.	2002-09-19
US	46840761	RMG5MVP05GR2E	0684841193	35411320	The Old Religion: A Novel	Books	3	2	6	N	N	The Old Soft Shoe	In The Old Religion, historical figure Leo Frank, a Jewish factory owner in the old American South falsely accused of rape and murder, then imprisoned and eventually lynched by an organised mob, is turned by Mamet into a religious philosopher, an all but obssessive turner over of truths and half truths, propositions and the voices within voices of a disputatious mind from a disputatious people. But the heart of it is still the same: \\"To be a man,\\" the Rabbi said, was to behave as a man in that situation where there were neither the trappings nor the rewards of manhood: scorned, reviled, abandoned, humiliated, powerless, terrified, mocked. \\"Now be a man...\\" the Rabbi said.\\"<br /><br />And in The Edge, a movie by Mamet, the millionaire played by Anthony Hopkins is an obssessive learner and compiler of facts, a man detached from his emotions, who through the forces of a melodrama plot, (a plane goes down stranding him in the wilderness with his wife's lover, the fashion photographer Alec Baldwin who wants him dead) is forced to confront himself and, stripped to his essentials, survive. In a sense, The Edge is the opposite story to The Old Religion in that the former has as its central motif a canoe paddle on whose two sides a rabbit and a ravenous beast, I cannot quite recall what, co-exist. Why is the rabbit not afraid? \\"Because he knows he's smarter then the..\\" Fox, I believe the beast is. It is significant that the line, among the best in the film, is not quite memorable enough to hold the mind. And the central, memorable sequence of the film is millionaire and adulterous rival being forced to collaborate in killing a bear.  That bear was more memorable than the characters or the dialogue. In The Old Religion the opposite moral is operative, Frank is in no useable way smarter than his employee Jim, who uses the white Southern mob's unwillingness to believe in the intelligence of a \\"nigro\\" to fool them and gets away with murder, dooming the outsider Jew. You cannot be smarter than the fox and disruptive nature, chaos; the forces of darkness cannot be conquered - you must only stand and face them as you may, that is the true heart of Mamet's reveries.<br />The trouble is that this does not always amount to a compelling fulcrum, in and of itself, it must accompany colour or is bland, a blank stare in the face of onrushing doom - Mamet's stoic glance in the face of the cancer look.<br /><br />In The Old Religion, Frank's habits of dissecting, homelitically commenting on and generally discoursing throughout and over every event of his downward course lend the book the air of a series of absent minded sermons, underpinned with occasional colourful clues as to motive, projection through space and narrative to fate, the taste of life. As Mamet points out somewhere in his book of actors' sermons \\"True or False\\"- intentions are not interesting, a person's qualities are not interesting, only actions are interesting. Hence the only memorable thing about the Rabbi, a key figure of the last third of the book, is the way he lights a match, his way with a cigarette. This is actual character. Mamet doesn't give either Frank or the Rabbi or any of the other characters quite enough internal colour, a personal smell or feeling, to  make them anything - an actor could not successfully play them without addition and a reader cannot happily create them in the mind's eye because aside from the endless discourses- as Mamet's Frank asks himself at one point \\"what part of reason is not simply the recoil of fear?\\" - there is nothing much going on. The only thing which defines Frank's response in the face of the onrushing catastrophe is his reversion to the \\"Old Religion\\" of Judaism away from the \\"Old Religion\\" of the South, of America, of the belief in progress. This is not really, in itself, much that you can play. As Mamet the actor would put it: What's the objective? And it cannot really be said that Mamet the novelist has given the actor or reader much in the way of lines on a page to sustain the illusion of character.<br /><br />At the novel's early parts, before chaos unfolds, one feels a little like the inhabitant of a Aharon Appelfeld novel, where bitter laughter and irony is beneath every casual detail of the lives of comfortable Jews on the lip on an abyss. And Mamet's skill is always wordily present - for probably two thirds of the novel he manages to keep you reading, keep you turning the pages, despite very little meat between his odd moments of concrete detail. This is no small skill. But his aesthetic position about acting is disproved in his own work, in this particular book. Not enough blood in these characters to sustain the book.the way of lines on a page to sustain the illusion of character.<BR> <BR>At the novel's early parts, before chaos unfolds, one feels a little like the inhabitant of a Aharon Appelfeld novel, where bitter laughter and irony is beneath every casual detail of the lives of comfortable Jews on the lip on an abyss.

The Jews of this collection are not necessarily practising but, living though they do on a secularised Holy Land, they cannot seem to get away from the sacred unscathed to the profane. This would perhaps be the editor's bias but all she notes is that the tendency of the Israeli literature, in its inception at the hands of the only literarily trained group - men, was political and ideological. The new generation of women writers whom she seeks to represent reside in the apolitical, she says. Yet the opening story, Leah Aini's \\"Until the Entire Guard Has Passed\\", combines a diaristic portrait of domestic life and neighbourhood politics - the store keepers' poker game -with an abiding, brooding and inescapable sense of menace drawing back to the holocaust, which haunts the pregnant wife of the protagonist. And in each story that follows death, spiritual, emotional or physical is a presence - it is as if these Jews are not necessarily counting their mitzvot but they must safeguard their souls - these are not casual stones they walk upon and their smallest emotional exchanges have a consequence. Nor is this merely a result of the gender of the authors in this anthology - (the stories by women in an American anthology \\"The Slow Mirror\\" are no more God-fearing than those of the men) - the new Israeli women writers are God-fearing in the sense that those true believers in the early U.S. puritan days were - they are aware of the ever present possibility of sin.<br />And that, perhaps, is a definition of the Jewish voice, in its collective, cross national parameters. Not the fantastic parables of terror in Kafka, nor the nuances of Jewish detail in the lives of all but religionless present day drifters about the secular world, but a sense in which the Jews remain even now as their great forefathers were - courting the shifting paths of the desert with an uneasy and difficult to cast off burden of law.forefathers were - courting the shifting paths of the desert with an uneasy and difficult to cast off burden of law.	2002-08-14

These stories are at times weaker than even the piously, ideological duds which may lurk among a general Jewish fiction anthology's worthies, and its editors profess no particular agenda, letting their preface be a string of quotes from the avowed intentions of their accumulated authors. The spread is a considerable range and covers, one suspects, every possible suspect, or minority, rather than the usual suspects. A borderline pornographic story about a gay transvestite and his love-life, previously published in the American gay review \\"Evergreen Chronicles\\" (Shaun Levin's \\"Shoes\\"), has as its only \\"Jewish\\" content a fleeting reference to a Purim party which, perhaps, is central because it's the one place where the protagonist can wear his chosen mode of dress in public and without censure. Okay, maybe. Another, and utterly charming, end of this spectrum is Roseanne Rabinowitz's \\"Maza Softig\\" where a Yiddishist interviewer and a Serbo-Croat interviewee end up comparing terminologies for their breasts and thighs and other sweet parts in bed. This book is perhaps much more of a collage of Jewish life than literature, particularly in England, and the only conclusion is that, from this book at least, much of Jewish life isn't really all that Jewish, if by that you mean practising.<br />Which leads to the question of what a Jewish voice is, what collective Jewish voices might be. Rabbi Steinsaltz, the great Talmudist and translator of that repository of Judaism speaks at the London Jewish Book Week recently about the Passover Haggadah's parable of the four sons - it was not intended, probably, he says, but the sons are in fact a metaphor for the declining generations of present day Judaism. The wise one is the good practising Jew of the past, the wicked one is his rebellious son, the foolish one is the son of that one (who can at least be guided by his grandfather), and the last is the one who does not even know how to ask. Of Herzl, Israel's founder, Steinsatz notes that it was said he was too unversed in Jewish matters to even be called ignorant, the term did not apply. Steinsaltz believes that we are living in the era not even of the fourth son, who knows not enough to ask, but of the fifth son - the son who does not have the occasion to fail to ask, he is not at the Seder table at all, he is out in the world, like the authors of the pieces in \\"The Slow Mirror\\", and his contact with Judaism is tenuous, like the fading rememberance of a mother's tooth.ked one is his rebellious son, the foolish one is the son of that one (who can at least be guided by his grandfather), and the last is the one who does not even know how to ask.

Glenda Abramson, in the introduction to her &quot;Oxford Book of Hebrew Short Stories&quot;, gives a fairly history-book account of the development of modern Hebrew letters, with the one note that &quot;throughout the development of Hebrew literature writers have been nominated as representative because they exemplify a political consensus or a dominant ideology and many others have been omitted because they are perceived not to have done so.&quot; Her own candidate for greatness, Yitzhak Oren, failed to make this roll-call of social realism because while others were drawing the portrait of the new state he was indulging in &quot;Kafka like fantasies&quot;. Off-hand, this does not seem such a unique bias. Kafka was hugged into the bossom of European literature in an era of absurdism and, let us never forget, as a dead saint. His meticulously prosaic depictions of the fantastic, the reports of an insurance man, were fine parables for the shook-up faiths of the post-concentration camp dissenters against ideology. Wherever else in the globe such fantasy has sold, such as South America, there was also a political bias toward resistance in the audience. Abramson's man Oren has suffered, like science fiction writers and other writers of &quot;speculative&quot; fiction in the U.S. and other lands of true believers, by not being taken seriously because he saw through the emperor's clothes.<br /> The trouble with making one's only dissent to received opinion one &quot;revived&quot; writer and a handful of stories which &quot;appear for the first time in an anthology in English translation...chosen primarily for their aesthetic quality, their narrative texture and colour&quot; is that by accepting to an extent the burden of the cannon you become damned by failing to adequately represent it. If you will give an account of a literature consisting of its most famous practitioners - the &quot;Usual Suspects&quot; school of anthologizing - you cannot then simply omit a major figure with the note that to the anthologist's &quot;great regret Agnon is not represented..because the Institute of Hebrew Literature was unable to negotiate terms for the reproduction of his story &quot;The Garment&quot;. &quot; This won't do - either construct an argument for certain stories or do not have an argument at all - do not presume to represent the firmament and then announce, by the by, that you could not quite get clearance to use Orion.<br /> The translations, provided one assumes by that same institute, are not stunning. Two of the cannonical stories, by Hayim Hazaz and the father of the Hebrew story Mendele Mocher Seforim, are pieces the present author had to parse out word by word at school and for examinations, hence he has views on their potential in this language. Little things, like translating Mendele's town name which is a play on the word beggar as &quot;Beggarsburgh&quot; and all its citizens subsequently as &quot;Beggarsburghers&quot; - now, this is a solution to a problem which situates the language of the translation in neither England nor the U.S., nor, I suspect, any other English speaking province. If the aim of a translator is to reproduce the given text, brick by brick as it were, convincingly in another language, then the new edifice must be located somewhere in the language - if it has slang it must be the slang of a place and time, if it has references it must have references that make sense somehow within the history and geography of the host language. This invention, as an example, does the worst thing possible by attracting attention to itself as a &quot;translation&quot;, thereby undermining the credibility of the narrative voice, and still not solving the problem - if the speaker were American it would be &quot;Beggarsville&quot;, if English, perhaps, &quot;Beggarsbrough&quot; - a late twentieth century translator ofHebrew into English is probably aiming at an American market (where most of the world's English speaking Jews are) but, effectively, is writing a trans-Atlantic English, and these are the problems which translating into a language while (presumably in Israel) not living in it, can present.<br /> Such matters aside, Abramson's anthology shines with less than ideological pieces such as Dvora Baron's &quot;Sunbeams&quot; - a heartrendingly simple account of the unremitting darkness of humanity, back in the shtetl, where an orphan girl is passed hand to hand by people who do not want to take responsibility for her eating mouth, winding up an outcast, surviving on scraps and odd jobs, with the only remnant warmth &quot;a few words of endearment that came back to her from the mists of her early childhood&quot; and allow her to pet a cow, just calved for the first time and torn from its off-spring, with whom she forms a bond that leads her to prosperity ad some standing in the community before she dies, alone but no longer unseen. In stories such as these humanity outgrows the confines of a nationality and the shtetl could be a place where something, like nothing, happens anywhere.Hebrew into English is probably aiming at an American market (where most of the world's English speaking Jews are) but, effectively, is writing a trans-Atlantic English, and these are the problems which translating into a language while (presumably in Israel) not living in it, can present.<br /> Such matters aside, Abramson's anthology shines with less than ideological pieces such as Dvora Baron's &quot;Sunbeams&quot; - a heartrendingly simple account of the unremitting darkness of humanity, back in the shtetl, where an orphan girl is passed hand to hand by people who do not want to take responsibility for her eating mouth, winding up an outcast, surviving on scraps and odd jobs, with the only remnant warmth &quot;a few words of endearment that came back to her from the mists of her early childhood&quot; and allow her to pet a cow, just calved for the first time and torn from its off-spring, with whom she forms a bond that leads her to prosperity ad some standing in the community before she dies, alone but no longer unseen.

These chapters, first written as a series of articles for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, are a model of the rich, primary source biography. Thurber pulls no punches. His Ross is not &quot;a monument&quot; as he puts it, but a man, worth looking at in all his strange glory. I would rate this book alongside Herndon's Life of Lincoln as one of the best accounts of a man by his contemporary, without the veneer of legend and without an undercurrent of envy. Thurber shared an office with Ross for who knows how many years, learned a lot about writing from him (some examples of his razor fine editing are here to learn from), and did a great deal of his best writing in the man's employ. One of Thurber's best books, and that makes it one of the best books there is. You could do worse than read this book before trying to write a life of anyone who's still living. You could do worse than reading this book before trying to write even one article about the life of somebody alive and real.	2002-08-06

This is however a more contemporary book, written with a breezy journalistic style which makes it hard to put down, indeed compulsive. Not least in its charms is the snap and crackle of nearly everything Chandler himself wrote, not least the letters, which Hiney is wise enough to quote from liberally.<br />My main complaint is that I came away from this book with a sense of the author's disgust at his subject's decline into chaotic behaviour and helplessness after the death of his wife. My recollection of the MacShane book is of a certain tragic sympathy in the treatment of Chandler's last, disasterous years. Here one feels Hiney is disappointed with Chandler, that somehow the hero he has been peddling let him down. It is somehow the reader of the biography who is let down, suddenly finding the author whose wit he has grown rather fond of, dismissed as a sad old drunk. A readable book, but skip the ending if you like your Chandler, and go to the letters - which do not fail to show this sad, witty man at his droll best.	2002-08-06

He goes about detailing what he could find of all these details without much irony and without necessarily any over-view or thematic lense to view it through - and the result is curiously quaint and affectionate, almost a memoir by someone who didn't know the man but went everywhere he went. It is definitely NOT a hagiography and in that is very valuable as the subject recedes further and further into legend. A useful and brave book to be applauded.

I don't go six months without picking up this book and reading something in it. Very few poets can stand up to that kind of revisiting. Bleak humour and refusal to be falsely comforted. An eye for what you may remember at the end of your life.<br />Many of these are poems about women - wives and how he came to leave them, lovers and how they came to die and how he mourned, a young married mother whose baby he threw in the air and murmured PITTSBURGH to in between their trysts. Short, tender, very emotional poems from a man discinclined to easy emotion or postures. Poems to read at difficult junctures in your life and get perspective from. And, finally, poems with a great reach of ambition unusual nowadays in American verse. Poems that claim to talk to God, or at least sit with him for a while on the front porch.	2001-11-01
