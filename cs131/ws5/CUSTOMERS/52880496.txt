Nina seems to be increasingly reactive rather than pro-active.  I guess I never quite understood why she pushed Paul out of her life and that action doesn't seem to have improved either her outlook on life or her ability to choose cases/clients in her own best interest.  I finished this only out of respect to the time I've spent reading the series.	2005-07-22

This one was poorly written in that it seems as though everyone converses only in BOLD TYPE or exclamation points.  The hero is too easily convinced by future girl to believe her outlandish story and the secondary plot line between the hero's should have been mother in law and the bad guy from the future was downright laughable.  I guess the next book will be all about future girl's parents selling the reams of paper she hid for them to find (in the to be demolished years in the future) building and using the money to find their now older than they are grandkids from the past?	2005-07-19

I also found the outcome for the 'bad guy' to be totally unbelievable given the final body count and his stated intent.  Not a bad beach or pool book by any means, but this husband and wife writing team can and have done so much better with other offerings in the past.	2005-07-19

This is a well written, evenly paced story that brings a new dimension to the story of Thea and her Andre.  In the hands of a most skillful author, readers will laugh, cry, despair, and rejoice right along with the characters.   Some of the other reviewers have revealed the basic plot.  All I will add is DO NOT START this book late at night or you will get absolutely no sleep.  It is impossible to put this book down until the end.	2003-01-10

This time beings of another 'type' join the world of the Burg along with a pregnant sister Valerie, the nervous father-to-be, Grandma's new studmuffin, and the rest of the usual cast.  There's not much of a story and this book requires a lot of suspension of reality, but if you are a Plum fan, don't miss it.  The mystery definitely takes a back seat to the humor and a sense of holiday mischief.	2002-11-06

A large part of Angela Matelli's charm has come from her interactions with her extended (and supportive) family.  In this entry in the series, her family is minimized to a couple of phone calls and a few minutes in the first chapter.  The plot is unusual--voodoo on a New England college campus and the supporting characters are fairly well written.  But without the help and interference of the Matelli family, Angela seems to lose her edge and could be any number of interchangeable female private investigators.  Despite a better than average writing style and story line, Habeus Campus disappoints.  I probably will wait for the next to come out in paper back and am glad I bought this used.	2002-04-16

Although there is still a lot of time spent describing Chris's day to day activities with and without her son and husband, much more of the activity is actually important to the final solution.  Chris also seems to be making the transition to the 'real' world.  The character doesn't worry so much about things the rest of us would take for granted.  She actually buys an airplane ticket to Florida without reminding the reader that she never used to carry more than a dollar with her at any time.  There was also no last minute trip to the convent for help with the solution.  Sister Joseph makes an appearance but really doesn't help to solve this one.  Maybe it's because Chris is once again working to solve an old puzzle rather than a current murder case that her personality and methodology seem less abrasive and her questions somehow less intrusive.	2002-02-04

I bought this thinking it would be a 'fun' cozy read.  It is that and much more.  Don't think that you will be able to put this one down until you've finished--you won't.  The characters are well developed--and the plot has few holes. Even though it's pretty easy to spot the good/bad guys lurking under the surface, this is still a most enjoyable first book.	2002-01-14

One involves a detatched, frozen arm and the other revolves around Marti McAllister's best friend.  Both story lines are resolved, more or less, but I got the definite impression that the first was resolved in order to give Marti the opportunity to rescue her friend from yet another miserable choice.  I did not feel that the resolution of mystery one was given enough thought--and that's a shame because the author does a wonderful job of presenting her characters and has developed them tremendously throughout this series.  And up to the point that mystery one conveniently solves itself, the two story lines are well blended.  But then, it's cut and boom and off to rescue sappy Sharon.  This is not a bad book, just not as good as it should be, given the author's past efforts.  To get a better picture of this series, I would recommend reading one of the earlier entries.	2001-11-07

The absolutely scariest, sleep with your lights on, peek out of your closed eyelids at the shadows in the corners of your bedroom book I've ever read.  This was my introduction to the wonderful world of Barbara Michaels and I've remained 'hooked' ever since.  The characters of Pat, Ruth, Sara, and Bruce---not to mention Ammie, her gallant (if naive) lover, and her seriously flawed (and truly horrible) father are so well drawn that like Ruth and Bruce I too smelled lilacs in a Washington winter.	2001-07-25

Obviously, the solution to this book is in the last few pages but what perplexes me is not who but why???  Maybe the ending is so ambivilant because Kinsey is initially unsure about her client and seems to remain unsettled about the case through the entire book.  Maybe there is no 'submitted by' because Kinsey isn't through with the case and doesn't feel comfortable submitting a report on an open case.  The constant financial reckoning (of Fiona's retainer) seems to indicate that possibly she is more concerned about how much refund is due Fiona than whether or not she finds Fiona's ex.  No real explanation is given for the question of why Fiona is looking for him; the daughters of both wives remain unrealized characters; Henry just floats in and out of the story; and most unusual for a Grafton book, Kinsey herself doesn't seem able to commit herself to the problem(s) in any meaningful way.  There are a million unanswered questions about this 16th alphabet book.  Hopefully, Kinsey will show up in 17 and answer some of them!!	2001-06-18

This book started with a bang--the attempted abduction of a First Daughter, treachery by a trusted nanny, and the introduction of characters who seemed interesting at first glimpse.  Unfortunately, the plot falls apart--too many unrelated and unbelievable subplots--the CIA and manmade Russian diamonds, a mysterious mental link between the President's daugher and her 'rescuers', and a golden statue with alleged special powers.  There's also a lot of soap opera type dialogue about strong women, living life to the fullest, sharing 'joy' and seeking revenge.  The main characters are never brought fully to life and a promising beginning soon becomes muddled.<br />Although I'm a fan of this author's previous books, I will definitely not buy any new offerings....and I'm very glad that this one only cost me the 25 cent library reserve fee!	2001-06-18

I caught myself losing track of the somewhat weak story line thinking &quot;oh, he's Morelli, here's the Ranger figure and here's Lulu.&quot;   I found the humor forced in spots and Bubbles a far less appealing character than the original and the secondary characters definitely weak.<br />I don't regret paying hardback price for this debut, but will wait for either a library copy or a paperback for any sequels.	2001-05-16

I was not aware that this latest Lehane was a non-series book--I automatically put his books on reserve at the library so all this cost me was the 25cent reserve pick up fee.  After three serious attempts to read this book I GIVE UP.  Tedious and trite, this is just not a good book.  Like other successful series authors, I think that Lehane has gotten a little tired of his literary offspring and wanted to try something else.  In my opinion, what he has produced here simply wasn't worth his effort or worthy of his considerable talent.	2001-02-13

Probably if I had a deeper list of books on hand to read,  this one would be at the bottom of the pile!

My only complaint for the author is that I want more--more stories--please!  This is a well researched and well  told biography of a school that shouldn't have been killed by bureaucratic  nonsense.  <br />I hope everyone who ever walked through those magnificent  front pillars on Wornall Road will have a chance to read this book and  remember.	2000-07-12

The second entry in this series was enjoyable and probably deserves more than 3 stars, but in comparison to the first one, something is missing. I eagerly awaited this title and was thrilled to receive it before it was in  the bookstores.   But, what was hilarious in the first outing becomes just  a little bit 'tired' and contrived in this book.     Without giving away  any of the story, the main characters, Meg and Michael seem to be 'stuck'  in their relationship, and the secondary characters have lost some of their  appeal--possibly this comes from moving everyone to another location, maybe  just from over exposure. The plot is well thought out with a couple of  unexpected twists--and holds together with no unexpected villains coming in  from the wings at the last minute.   My recommendation?  If you only have  time to read one of Ms. Andrews' books, read 'Murder with Peacocks'--and  take your phone off the hook, send your kids outside and just enjoy!	2000-04-23

However she spends way too much time describing people's actions and motives by comparing them to another author's  characters.  Noone thinks or does anything on Broward's Rock without Annie  commenting to herself that the thought or action was just like this or that  fictional mystery character.  While I enjoy the bit with the contest that  has the characters guessing their fictional origin, this constant  &quot;showing off&quot; of the author's mystery fiction knowledge detracts  from the story.  Any true mystery buff probably knows as much but hopefully  doesn't spend their time sizing up their friends and family by this  criteria.<br />Stick to the mystery writing and leave the mystery trivia to  game players.	1999-10-21

This is an older, more tired, and less self secure V.I. than her readers are used to.   But underneath the worries about age, pension plans, and relationships is the same caring and crusading character  her fans have waited to greet for five years.  I took this in one  read--couldn't wait to see what would happen.  And I wasn't disappointed.   It's unusual for a character to have such an impact on readers that the  reader can feel hurt when the character is betrayed--this is the gift that  Ms. Paretsky gives to her readers this character is real; so it hurts when  Vic's friends turn on her.  Vic is like the high school chum you've kept in  touch with over the years and wished well--you get together once in a while  and catch up on each other.   I'm sure I join fans everywhere in hoping  there will be another full length V.I. story SOON!	1999-10-04

While I agree that there was a bit too much physics involved--it's  been a long time since grad school--the characters were honest in their  development--I would like to see a bit more about Decker's &quot;big  girl&quot; in another book and how about Rina leaving the house and  involving herself more in Peter's professional life?  But these are my own  personal wishes.  <br />If perhaps &quot;Jupiter's Bones&quot; is not  a   great book, it is a very good book, written by an author who has not lost  interest in her characters and has provided her long time readers a welcome  return to familiar ground.  The plot is tight, the ending doesn't  disappoint and hopefully Margie will find some happiness as a foster  mother.	1999-08-20

How about an ending that ends a book instead of  coming to a certain number of pages [or words] and stopping?  Kay and Lucy  are purported to be highly intelligent women, why do they act so oddly all  of the time--this is not something that started with Benton's death--Lucy  is always angry and out of control and Kay needs some serious R &amp; R!!!	1999-08-13

This book really deserves only 1 star but out of respect for the truly wonderful series that suffers a letdown with this book, I give it 2.  Doesn't the NYPD have anything better to do with what are purported to be  two of its best officers?  Did Mallory get a message from outer space  nudging her to investigate a World War II death?  Like other readers I  expected a Mallory who was at least slightly affected by the action in the  previous book.  But no, she is the same amoral machine we previously  encountered.  Her supporters have become her apologists and even they are  beginning to have doublt about her.  Is there a direction to this series or  just a series of non connected police stories?   Instead of wasting a book  on this slight story, why not a short, short story--that's all the plot  content allows.  I will hope for better from the next Mallory.	1999-08-01

With minimal secondary character development,  a 'villain' whose motivation remains obscure even at the end, and a main character who seems to be  predisposed to distrust her significant other [who has never given her any  reason not to trust him] and a plot that doesn't connect from one incident  to another, don't bother!	1999-07-20

I really enjoyed the earlier books in this series, but despite my best efforts and several tries, couldn't get through this one.  Maybe it's because Harry and her buddies are starting to say the same thing over and  over again.  Or maybe it's because these should be fun to know characters  are becoming as boring and predictable as their dialogue has become.  Cute  only goes so far, even in a light hearted mystery and then it gets tedious.   Maybe the animals should do less and the humans just a bit more if this  previously entertaining series is to keep moving forward.  After all, the  gimmick of the talking animals has been well established.	1999-06-08

Despite their  problems, Angie and Patrick are better together than apart and with the  possible addition of a Bubba love interest [and isn't it great to see Bubba  become a man instead of a cartoon?], I think Mr. Lehane can keep this one  going for quite a while.  This has become one of those series that will be  read as much, or more, for the characters as the plot.  As a prodigious  mystery reader, I find that after a while the plots do tend to be  forgotten, but great characters keep the reader coming back eager for more.

Gloria not only had a brain, she also has hips, a loyal friend from childhood to help center her, an intriguing romantic interest, and a rather unusual place of residence.  I can hardly wait for the helium murder, and so forth.	1998-06-09
US	52880496	R1I32IXJCZKGT	0385299338	472660217	Ghost Country	Books	1	3	4	N	N	This book appeared to be  self indulgent.	Ms. Paretsky certainly doesn't have to continue writing the V.I. series in order to satisfy her legions of loyal readers.  However, this book is in no way a good read or an enjoyable story.  If Ms. Paretsky is tired of V.I., she is a talented, engrossing, and involving enough author to devise a better plot and characters than she 'gave birth' to in this book.  An avid reader, I have one basic requirement, the character(s) must make you want to know them better, whether the reader likes or understands them or not--otherwise why read that particular book?  These inhabitants of &quot;Ghost Country&quot; were no more interesting or involving of the reader at the end of the book than at the beginning and the story could have been anything--bottom line, who cares?  I call this self indulgent because it seems to be a case of a so-called popular author (which there is absolutely nothing wrong with being) striving to become something else.  Ms. Paretsky doesn't owe her readers anything but a good read--but she does owe us that.	1998-06-03

If Ms. Paretsky was tired of V.I., then either end the series or take a longer break from writing.  The fifty cents that was wasted was my library reserve fee--I certainly am glad that I didn't spend more than that!!	1998-06-01

How soon can we expect more of Simon's exploits?  Mystery, humor, and a little romance + intelligence without ego.	1998-01-29

This one--well I've started it a dozen times and can't keep interested in it long enough to remember where I put it down the last time.  Good author, great idea, don't mess with the formula and I use formula in the best sense of the word, not the worst.	1997-12-29
