My friends had been pestering me to read this book since high school and I had never got around to it until recently. To my utter dismay the story he has written is a magical one. It's one that is timelessand can invoke great emotion. That because its Fellowship of the ring. How the author did not get sued over this obvious rip off is beyond me.<br />Two little farm boys who live in a quiet part of the world and have no interest in the affirs of others. Not unlike the Shire. Are approched by a big powerful man not unlike Ghandalf. Whom tells them of an ancient evil that was meant to have been defeated but stirs again. Only one thing can stop him and its up to one of the farm boys because he is the only one who can weild it. <br />They farmboys get poisoned and are dying. Just like when the Ringwraith stabbed Frodo. They are taken to a mysterious place of healing that bears a remarkable likeness to Rivendell. The boys are saved and the group sets off on their journey. The mountain passes are watched closely and after debate it is decided to go through the Tomb of kings. Moria anyone?<br />You get the idea. This book is so close in plot and structure to Lord of the rings.  Very disappointed that this book is so unoriginal.<br />Read Lord of the rings instead.	2004-03-06

I have to say I am very impressed. The book is possiblly the best Rpg book I have ever seen. The layout is excellent, the information interesting and the rules easy to understand. There are rules for making up several of the races from the show and good basic information on each one.A complete overview of season 1 is included and at the end of each episode entry there is additional information on things from within. From Midnight on the firing line as an example there is info on Centauri mines, Raider command and control ships and trader routes. If you want to play in the Babylon universe then this book is awsome. Worth every cent.	2004-01-30

It is one of those books that drew me to Vampire to begin with. Great detail about the period, how vampires fit into it. How to play a vampire knight. Religion and how both vampiric knight and also mortal ones view it. <br />  The book itself is a fun read, not just filled with rules but flavour to make the game better. Some of the concepts could be used in any game that uses knights.<br />Well worth the money. My only complaint is the art needed to be a bit better.	2002-12-31

Its writing style is very fluid and well done as well as being imaginative. The author explains the use of a lot of interesting words. It makes the kids think about things  and is teaching them as well. <BR>The book does appear to be despressing, but you have to look deeper to see what is really going on. The children are always battling to overcome problems that stand in their way, and they never give up and never surrender. <BR>The subject matter is at times a little extreme for young readers, but as always I suggest you read it first and then judge for yourself if you think it is appropriate. <BR>Excellent value and a good read.	2002-04-30

It has the right ingridients to be one. But it just lacks a punch when really needed. The story is hamstrung by a couple of stupid plot points. As the Jedi do not learn about the Sith until the events in episode 1. The author constantly struggles with how to involve characters without them really learning what is going on. Once they do you know something nasty is going to happen to them. This takes away from the suspense somewhat.<BR>  Also Obi-Wan Kenobi who enters the story midway through really has nothing to do, He wanders around trying to peice everything together and you guessed it, because of the events in episode 1. He can't figure it out. <BR>    The first time he see's Maul is on Tatooine, so he has no chance of averting or changing or learning anything. He really didn't need to be in the novel.<BR>    But all that being said it was a fun read. We learn a little more about Maul. Some of his insights into the force and his respect for a worthy foe add some deapth to the character.<BR>    If you like Maul then pick it up. You will enjoy the ride.	2002-02-08

But it is a huge letdown. The infomation for the most part is not new. They mention equipment and give very few pictures for it. The Trade federation is in it. What for? They attacked Naboo they are not a part of it. They are interesting but needed to be in a different book.<BR>   There are NO prestige classes at all. Could they not think of any Prestige classes that would be Native to Naboo? It seems not. The whole book just comes off as a poor effort. <BR>   The adventure is close to half the book and isn't that exciting and is also set in the battle of Naboo. Too bad if that isn't where your campaign is set.<BR>    Is there anything good about it? yes there is. But not alot. They need to do better. Much better in future and give the players something real. Like what happened to Naboo during the Rebellion era and the new Jedi order? What events have shaped it if you want to use it in a future game. But it has nothing. <br />Very weak. If you have to have it then get it. Otherwise save your cash for some other SW products.	2002-02-05

This book was not as good as the main rulebook. But then it depends on what you are looking for. History and factual information [when avaliable] is abundant. It covers alot of the book and is quite in deapth. That is worth 5 shuriken I mean stars ;). Which is a very interesting read.<BR>   It adds alot of info for adding ninja into the game and some of it is very useful indeed. But by the end of the book. I felt that there should have been more game related info. But it is still worth your money. If you want to seriously add Ninja to your game then buy this book for sure.	2002-01-15

Of all the Japanese style rpg's done over the years this one is the best by far. But with all the talk of Legends of the five rings and about how good it is meant to be. It can become hard to find an alternative.<BR>   But there is an alternative to the corperate heavy and rigid L5R. And that alternative offers you something that L5R does not...choice.<BR>   Sengoku is all about choice. It gives pages and pages about the Sengoku era. It gives you the choice of playing Ninja characters. Something L5R treats with distain. It gives you the choice of realistic to flying through the air styles of game. It talks about having a mixed party of Samurai and Ninja and how each style of game is different with that in mind. <BR>    The information is very well defined and laid out. Some of the rules are a little harder to understand. A little more clarity would not have gone astray here and there. But that does not ruin how good a game this is. This game is all about role play and not about having to fit within the designers idea of what is good.<BR>     Of them all I strongly recommend Sengoku. And if you find that you just can't tear yourself away from L5R then you will even find converstion notes in the back of the Sengoku book. This book is worth the money.	2002-01-15

Ree Soesbee has a very unique ability, and that is to take any interesting clan and make it dull, 2 dimensional and very boring. Apart from a couple of glimmers in The Crane she managed to ruin them. Now she has sunk her claws into the Dragon. The Dragon a clan of mystery, riddles and enigma in all regards. Until now, there is absolutly none of that in this book. It lacks completly in every department that the Dragon are known for. <BR>   The characters are completly flat and she failed to make even the interesting of them worth reading. Whatever this book is about it certainly isn't the Dragon. If you have the rest of the series then you have to get this one to know what is going on. But every single page is a struggle. I hope this is the last novel that Ree Soesbee does.	2002-01-10

I know people that compare every fantasy book to Lord of the Rings and while I consider LOTR to be the father of modern fantasy in many ways. I try to not compare them.<BR>    However every now and again a book comes along that has a LOTR feel. I thought this one did. Shalmistra the Elven forest seemed alot like Lothlorien, the Elves themselves seemed to be a copy and sterotypical.<BR>    I found that disappointing as R.A Salvatore is quite a good author. I have enjoyed many of his other books, but this one just seemed to miss the mark.<BR>    There were some nice ideas. A scholar who was not an adventure as the main character is a cool concept and something I have not often come across in fantasy novels. In the first book of the series Cadderly show a reluctence to kill. This was refreshing compared to so many books I have read where death is handed out like candy at Halloween. When he had killed he had very mixed emotions about it. This was also good character development. But he agonises over so much to become tiresome. He spends much of the second book killing Orcs and Orges and then whining about it. It just gets old after 2 books.<BR>    Having said all that the series isn't all bad and some good backup characters make the series workth reading.	2002-01-07

It is interesting and the artwork is excellent. But I found that it didn't really offer alot new. A few scraps here and there, much of which was hinted at during the series.<BR>   If you don't want the DVD series but want to know all about it then this is a good buy, if you are a evangelion nut then buy it. But if you own the series and are just happy with it then I would not buy this as well.	2001-12-29

He shows step by step how to a car side on. Every step of the way. Then there are several cars side on. He cuts out some of the steps but tells us to do it the way we did the first one and to check back to it. After that he shows how to do cars from angles. <BR>   The joy of this book isn't just in the cars he has chosen. Everything from a 1906 franklin to a formula 1 racer is in it. But he explains how to look at photo's, or magazines and draw the cars from there. <BR>   He also shows how to turn a standard car into a fantasy car. It really is worth the money. An excellent book.	2001-12-11

The characters are very interesting especially the Gnome and I hate Gnomes. The action is excellent and the plot interesting.

It is a big strong hero who knows what has to be done and he goes and does it. He doesn't have many weaknesses and he destroys everything that stands in his way.<BR>     Those are the rules. The plots of these stories are often thin, some of the characters two dimensional and the action a little over the top. But that is what it is all about. <BR>     I do not go into reading one of these expecting &quot; Tinker, taylor soldier spy.&quot; These books are not gritty true to life spy drama. They are action/adventure with a healthy does of action.<br />    But it is refreshing when they come up with a good concept, where the plot isn't too weak and the action moves with the plot and not as a subsitution for one. I found this story one of the better ones of the series. I hope that they do more of this calibure.	2001-12-09

I have always enjoyed the &quot; In action.&quot; series, and the Hurricane in action is not an exception. However, the real strength of this book is the photo's. There are a great many photo's of an unusual nature and showing the Hurricane in many different marks and situations.<BR>     Where the book is weakest is in the information. It is not bad, but it feels like the pictures are carrying the book. The info is very 2 dimensional. Especially when compared to other books in the series where the info and pictures compliment each other.<BR>    If you want to pick up a In action book this one might not be the best. If you are after info on the Hurricane specificly then you will find elements of this book useful.	2001-12-06

I found it a chore to get through and reasonbly dull. Why 4 stars then? Because I do not like the Crab clan much and so was always going to find it a tougher read. But it is very well written. I like the writers style and the way he puts things together. So even though I didn't enjoy the book I can appreciate it. If you like the Crab clan then it will probobly be a great read. It does cover the clan in deapth, especially the way they think and come to their decisions. If you have read the other books then this is a must.	2001-11-25

But for the first one released it is pretty good. Their is a little back story, a small town to add some flavour and another place to visit and use in games.

The characters are very different from his usual mix. Which is good and bad. Some of his characters are good and strong and interesting and others like the love interest and the headmaster are rather shallow.

This really is a good book. Lots of new monsters to add flavour to a campaign. Anything that adds to the campaign is a good thing. But for this product the cost is very high. Roleplaying books have always been expenisve. But this one pushes it too far. I walked away from D&amp;D over 10 years ago. The only thing that has got me excited again was when I picked up the players guide and saw the content and price. I bought it and the DM's guide and I am certainly going to buy more. I am VERY excited about the new look and the new direction the game is taking.<BR>   But this one book leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. If you don't have it buy the Monster manual instead.	2001-10-14

The theat is so nasty and so dangerous that the main character when he is off on his own, doesn't carry a simple mobile phone. Simple errors of judgement that he does so the story builds more suspense and a overly long intro that isn't related to the main story does alot to slow this one down.	2001-08-26

Alot of good action and an idea that really isn't that bad. But I think the problem with the book is it's length.

The prime directive, the safty of the Enterprise and crew as well as the beliefs and how to deal with an alien culture.    But in the end it doesn't really cover any in deapth.

However my biggest complaint is I am not sure what version of Bond he is writing. With M being Judi Dench's character it would lead one to think he has chosen Brosnon as his template. But after reading 3 of his books that just doesn't seem to be the case. His Bond doesn't fit any of the ones so far whether it be from film or books. In some ways that's good in others not as much. He seems to be having a little trouble deciding on the character still.    There is no Q in this book and no gadgets which is a little disappointing. There is no flashy car and for the most part Bond is weak almost wounded.    A plus is the use of Bill Tanner, a character that I always liked and was pleased to see him in Goldeneye and these books as well.    Overall I am happy that there are still Bond novels being written and unless they get utterly unbearable then I will continue to buy them. This book is average. It passed the time and I hope further books will improve.	2001-07-31

And in many ways it is. But there is a fair amount of information on other aircraft. It is almost like the author didn't feel comfortable about discussing the Beaufighter without showing us where it came from. I didn't mind this so much as I had very little information on the other aircraft described.    It is filled with excellent pictures and drawings and the center pages of the different schemes is always good. This isn't the best Beaufighter book out there, but it isn't too bad.	2001-07-10

It is a fast and powerful prop fighter/bomber. This is the first book I have bought on the plane. I was both impressed and disappointed with it.    It does cover alot of different aspects of the plane and it's uses. But it covers very little of its action over vietnam.

I try to avoid giving 1 star because there is usually some redeeming quality to a book/film. But not Anne Perry's work. Here is a woman who gives formula writers a good name.<br />     She is completly unable to get to the point, chosing instead to just wander aimlessly on for page after page after page. At times there seems no end to it.<br />    But I think this writer a fool and utterly over rated in every sense of the word. These books are meant to be about a certain William Monk. A Sherlock Holmes copy but with a twist. Quite interesting and one reason why I picked the first 3 books up.    But he is only the star in the first book. AND HE DOESN'T SOLVE THE CRIME IN THE SECOND! Somebody else does. The third follows the same trend as the second.    The true star is a nurse. A nurse who HAS no point to be in any story other than the first one. Of which she was an important player. But after that she has no place whatsoever to be in any of the other books.    She is a nurse nothing more, yet everyone she knows dies. Death follows her and she interigates the grieving families like a police office. A ridiculas concept.    William Monk who is an interesting character and who until fired from his position as an Inspector had every reason to be involved in the deaths without prior connection to the families. A concept that seems to be lost on perry.     It's almost like she got bored with Monk after the first book and decided the nurse is a much more interesting character.    On top of that, every book is the same. All the characters in them are clones of previous ones. And they are all sterotypes. There is no difference in their mannerisms, beliefs or reactions. They are just robots following a routine. They go on and on about the same things well after any reader has recieved the idea.     She is so hooked on the setting that she loses in every department. Characters, story, plot, forward motion and the ambiance that Victorian London has all suffer because of it.These books would not have been anywhere near as popular if they had been written in a modern setting.     .... If you wish to read Anne Perry then I suggest the first William monk book which I did enjoy, but then move on to other things.	2001-05-16

If you expect these books to be as good as Flemming's then you are going to be disappointed. If you are going to compare them to Flemming's then don't bother reading them. Because all you will do is have a rant about people giving them 5 stars.     They are at least new Bond stories, have they been great? No I don't think so. But I don't think they have been garbage either. They share more with the movies than they do with the original books.      They are light hearted action adventure, not a gritty spy thriller. If you like the Bond movies and are not going to be too critical then you will find these books a fair read.       Although I didn't mind some of the Gardner books I don't think he captured either the movies or the books. At least Benson is trying when it comes to the Cars, gadets and guns.       The sperm bank idea is a little odd in this book even for Bond. But I still enjoyed reading it.	2001-05-07

The artwork could be a little better to my mind. But that is very much a personal thing. The story is what really draws me in. Strong characters and a very interesting veiw into Itto's idea of bushido.     I love the new format and they look really nice all lined up on a bookshelf. These I have out. All my normal comics go into plastic sleeves and into a folder.     I am really starting to like the graphic novel format. <br />    If you like samurai then you will love this series. The second book is not as good as the first. But it does have some interesting concepts. Well worth a read.	2001-04-04

The art is great, the photo's cool. Everything on that side of things looks really professional.         It is great to see Wizards doing the game as it looks like they are going to do a really good job of it.<br />     My only complaint is that there isn't enough in the book to play. Forget playing in the rebellion or new republic era. They are not covered at all in any detail.<br />     Episode 1 is the only era covered in any detail. Which is a big disappointment. I will be running games in that era but there isn't stats on the standard stormtrooper in the book. <br />     There is a very high level of favortism to Phantom menace in the game. In time I hope it will balance out so we can play in all 3 eras.<br />     Some of the stats are very weird for movie character stats. They have Maul stronger than Vader. Not a hope in hell of that being the case. Episode 1 is the in thing and the game reflects that.<br />    But overall this is a good book and the game looks like it will grow in some interesting directions. if they continue to do things at this standard then it should do well.	2001-03-10

I found this book an utterly dreary bit of work. It is filled with incredibly two dimensional characters. As well as the fact that there are so many characters that none of them are done in any depth. And nearly all are sterotypes.      All the ladies and gentlemen in the story are overly dimwitted. As does the hero of the book Inspector Monk. Who is truely baffled and wanders around asking the same questions over and over. It became quite boring after a while.     The book slowed down to a crawl at times and desperatly needed some life in it.      The fact that Monk really does fail to work out what was going on is very disapointing. Especially when compared to The face of a stranger. Which I did enjoy reading.      The real heroine in this story is Hester Lattery. As she is the only one who really works anything out. Her being written into this novel I find dubious at best. My opinion is that she should have worked more with Monk and his assistant Evan both of who hold much potential as characters.      There was also two much courtroom drama. Which in a mystery novel I find absolutly little need for. It was almost as if Perry was confused as to what she wanted to write. A mystery novel or a courtroom battle. I feel much of the courtroom was written so Hester Lattery had an enterence and no more than that. As the dealings of it have absolutly no relevance to this book.    <br />   The good part of the book is the plot and the setting. The ideas she has are good and interesting. The main characters are interesting and have alot of potential. They were just under used or poorly done this time round.<br />    However I have not given up on her yet and I will read the third book Defend and Betray.	2001-02-09

We have to take this for what it is. A new author writing Bond novels.<br />    Is this book an improvment over the gardner ones. In my opinion yes. I did enjoy some of the Gardner books. But for the most part found them pretty tiresom.<br />    This book covers an interesting idea. But just doesnt seem to come fully to grips with it. He does Bond fairly well and the action isn't bad.<br />    This series has promise and I am hoping that as Benson does more books that they will improve. Still it is good to see a new Bond adventure.	2001-01-25

They are fast paced and exciting. Using alot of different equipment and ideas in use by Police and Military forces today.          This one was just a little over the top for my liking. There was less of the macho one liners which was a good thing. But they made up for that with gore. <br />    I don't mind violent stories, it comes with the territory in action stories. But it has to be there to add to the story and to move it along. Not just for the sake of it. And that to me is what alot of it was in this story. Just there to fill up space.<br />   Still a good listen, but not my favorite one.	2001-01-19

It was slow right from the beginning. Every single character in the book is 2 dimensional and under developed. The author had a concept when he wrote this book and the concept was sterotype.      There is so little development in both story and characters that it staggers the mind. I am hoping that the second book will be much better. Most rpg adaptaions are not very good, and this author didn't want to break that tradition it seems. A pity as the Toreador are a very interesting clan.       If you are a die hard vampire fan then give it a read, if not pick up something else.	2001-01-12

I loved the first book the Scorpion. very east to follow very well written. But from that point on there has been absolutly no consistency. An amazing plot possibility at the end of the Scorpion was utterly ignored for the Unicorn as it jumped ahead a couple of years. Now the Crane book is set at roughly the same period as the Unicorn.<br />    Instead of a well laid out plot that follows on from each other, they are starting to jump around and not seem very thought out. <br />   Good points: The authors writing style is good, and most of the characters are well described.<br />    the action is good and fast paced.        A good insight into the Crane, especially the Daidoji family.<br />    Bad points: A saved by deity style ending and a little bit cliche. <br />    At times asks for a little too much suspension of disbelif. Even in a fantasy novel you can go too far with the lone hero saving the day. That has become almost patheticly cliche in all these books. As each one so far has ended by a lone hero against over-whelming odds. GIVE IT A REST ALREADY! There are far more creative ways to end each book. They are getting very close to becoming the same book just the characters have different names.<br />   These books are still fun to read. I just feel they could be so much better and if the writers would give us the readers some credit and put just that little bit extra effort in, then these books would really be something to talk about.	2001-01-05

The executioner series is nothing more than cheap action. But it is still fun. The action is always fast paced and the characters are interesting enough for the genre its in. <br />   The situation in this one is interesting, being situated in Peru. The reading of this story is pretty good and that has been what has held me to them.  Richard Rohan tries to give each charcter life and reads with passion.<br />  If you want to have a bit of fun for 3 hours of action, then give this cassette a listen.

This book was an okay read, but not a riviting one like the first book. Some of the characters were interesting, but the pace of the book seemed a little rushed to me. Like she needed to get to the next part as quickly as possible without going into deapth.<br />    There were some interesting things that I really wanted to learn more about at the end of the first book and the unicorn book just jumped ahead and didnt go into any of them at all. Which I found disappointing.<br />    For me the most annoying thing was the odd japanese word usage. I assumed that the spoken language was not english even though it is printed as english, that being the case to see a sentence like &quot; Sumimasen. I am disturbing you.&quot; instead of just &quot; Excuse me. I am disturbing you.&quot;  Struck me as a pointless and silly thing to have done. It happens quite alot throughout the book.<br />   However it is still a good read and some of the characters make it worth the effort. If you like the series then read it.

There are at times some very useful ideas in this book. It does cover in it's own way alot of different areas. But if you are a new writer don't read this book. The author covers more reasons to not write, than to write. Also there are books devoted to getting published, how to find agents and all the gritty business asspect of writing. To see the same generalisations printed again and agin in these books is a waste of space.<br />    Why would you pick this book up or one similar? To learn more on the craft of Sci-fi/Fantasy right. The book should be filled with ideas on how to make your story better, to learn about what goes into  a Sci-fi story. What other writers have done and how to make a good idea you have better.<br />   Certainly to some extent that is true with this book, but for me there is not enough of it in here. After reading his views on nearly all the subgenres of Sci-fi it seems that he likes very few. And if your a new writer thinking of doing a story then his views may discourage you from ever picking up the pen or sitting in front of a computer.<br />   These books should never preen our ego's. But new writers who are not yet confident about writing need to hear who to make their idea better, more well rounded. The book should be filled to the brim on tips and ways to refine your writing craft specific to Sci-fi/fantasy. And to me it's not. <br />    There are ecellent books out there on getting publish, clarity, grammar etc. That stuff doesn't need to be in these genre books. <br />    If you are planning on writing a alien invasion story, then you don't to hear him say. This type of story is over done and dull. You need to read lots of ways then to find out how to make that type of story stand out. How to refine your idea and shape it. This book in my opinion doesnt do that. It says alot of what he doesn't like to read or thinks is good in a novel, but not always alot of ways to improve an idea.<br />    There is still some worth to this book.But in my opinion there will be better books on the subject avaliable.	2000-10-02

Much like a novel without a good ending. However it does have it's plus sides. There is some very good sound advice in there, some things that beginners may not have thought of.

The start of a large series of books following the career of richard bolitho from midshipman to captain of his own vessel.     there are actually two stories in the first book. the first deals with a trip to  africa the second deals with smugglers. i enjoyed the second part of the  book far more. i think he was getting more of a feel for the character the  more he wrote.     the book is just a little slow for my tastes and there  is for a large part not alot of action. however the characters are very  likable and that goes a long way to keeping the interest.      the world  did seem full and interesting with great potenial. the situations were  different and had a unique feel to them.     the book does has it's  problems. but it is the first in a long series and every first book has  it's problems. but having said that if you like period naval stories then  you could do alot worse than this one. i will be reading the second.       give it a go, you may find it a pleasnt surprise.	2000-01-07

There are very few books that I have to have. When I heard that there was going to be a series featuring many of the bounty hunters I just couldn't wait.     Now having read all 3 I think to myself, were any of the hunters  in the series. Sure the names were there but not the characters. Boba Fett  just talked to anyone who would listen like a drunk at a bar. All of the  other hunters acted like fools. There is no way Vader would have selected  these losers if they were like they are in this series.     It had such  potential to show the hunters in detail and to give us more info about  them. In the end it was a case of finish it so that i could go on to  another book. If you have read the first 2 and want to know how it ends  then read it. Otherwise read some of the other starwars books.     In the  future I hope that there will be a series that is written on the hunters,  with a book for each one. This could have been a good start, but just keeps  coming up short.	2000-01-05

The book does tend to drag at times and I was a bit disappointed to find the main focus of the book was the humans. Who are shown as not much more than very intelligent  brats. They argue and insult each other. None of them ever seem to get on  with each other.     The thing that made it readable for me was the  problems the robots suffer and the logic used to defeat each problem was  captivating.      But the characters and many of the robots seemed bland.  However this book was written quite awhile ago and I think that has to be  taken into account.     If you are interested in the robot series then give  it a read. If you are interested in Asimov books in general then start with  one of his other works.	2000-01-05

In the massed market of fantasy novels that now fill the bookstore shelves, it is rare find to come across a book that has it's very own feel.     The black company was thrilling, there are no knights in shineing  armour, or damsels in distress. It has a very dark undercurrent which is  rarely done.     I found this book to be a very refreshing change from the  nursey ryhme style fantasy. Not everyone will enjoy the series, but if you  are looking for something a little different then by all means give this  one a read.	2000-01-05

The book is as much a search for his identity as it is solving the crime.     I enjoyed the overall idea for the book, even if it is a tad  unrealistic. But I am willing to cut the author a little slack.    William  Monk is a likable hero even though he often seems a little weak. His  sidekick was also interesting but not fully defined. This may have changed  in later books.      The only problems i really had with the book is her  use of Victorian slang, she does not always let us know what the slang  means. The book ends very abruptly without finding out what happened to the  arrested party.     The book is a much better read in Victorian England. I  am not sure that it would have held my interest had it been modern.       Although not on a level with Sherlock Holmes novels, this book was still  interesting and enjoyable. If you like Victorian mystery then give this  book a read.	2000-01-04

But not this one. Although I found it a little slow, it does have to do all the ground work. Apart from a couple of  known characters like Wedge Antillies the cast is all new.      All the  characters get introduced and there is a decent enough emphasis on  characters and not just plot.     I have always liked the X-wings and this  book does them justice. If you like Starwars and X-wings then this book  should not disapoint.	2000-01-04
