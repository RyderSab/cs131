Hope Stevens is now Alice Stevenson who has a very precocious five-year old daughter named Penny. They're constantly on the run, and Penny has had enough. She walks right into the trap set by the Romero brothers, the family who wants to kill her mother.

Something you cannot resist when it comes on the market. Spenser, Hawk, Susan Silverman, and Pearl are like good friends to visit. But when those friends never change and say the same old things. You seek new friends! If the series continues, it would be interesting to see the dynamics somehow change between Spenser, Hawk, and Susan, some way, some how. These characters seem frozen in time.The indispensable Hawk is injured on the job. Shot in the back three times, he came within inches of being killed. Spenser and Hawk declare they have to get revenge on the Ukrainian mobsters that were a part of the hit.  Cold Service is from Spenser's point of view, but you do hear more about Hawk, and how he lives his life. His short-lived relationship with Cecile is inevitably compared with what Spenser has with Susan Silverman. Their seemingly perfect relationship has not moved one iota in years, and they both seem to be perfectly happy with that. The Gray Man from a previous novel is brought in by Spenser to help infiltrate the mob in Cold Case. There are many brutal killings in this novel. As one reviewer noted, Spenser says there were at least 20 murders related to this case. How on earth could the police not question their involvement? The plot at the end seems very convoluted. The chapters are quick reads but by the last couple of pages, you might hear yourself saying how much more can I take?	2005-04-10

There was no one with an ounce of uniqueness. The plot was too predictable, the timeline too long and too fuzzy, and the writing was uninspiring.  Nicholas Stephanopolis, a billionaire businessman, husband of Laura Marlowe, father of Atlanta and Venetia, was someone easy to despise. Does the story of how Nicholas turned away from his oldest daughter Atlanta really ring true? Not really.  His brutality towards his wife and mistress does not gain him any empathy. The clause Nicholas puts in his will for his daughters stretches reality a bit. Atlanta and Venetia endure every imaginable social problem from the late twentieth century onwards. They do achieve a lot at such young ages, perhaps more than in reality. Certainly the insider's view of the rich and famous is fun and exciting and entertaining, but in truth not really sustainable for an entire novel.	2005-03-19

It goes through many basic terms and concepts of human relationships and behavior. The author wants us to understand assertiveness before trying to put new ways of thinking into practice. The important part of the author's lesson is reminding us that assertiveness is part of a person's behavior but is not the person. It builds up to the ten steps of preparing for a confrontation. The written exercises are useful, the diagrams and check boxes not so much. Some terms were basic but many times when things are not working right, we have to be reminded of the basics. Personally, I would not choose to use the assertiveness scorecards in my regular day-to-day routine. It goes over what a DESO script, Describe, Express, Script, Outcome; could mean to anybody's personal and work relationships. How one can change a few steps in giving criticism to create positive feedback. The Assertiveness workbook makes you take a breath, and think before speaking. Clear, easy-to-read, straight-to-the-point chapters are there to help when needed.	2005-03-14

Sasha Boardman is a very successful Paris Art Dealer. She learned to love art from her father, and went to work at his gallery. Sasha enhanced the gallery by expanding their interests to contemporary artists and encouraged her father when she moved there to open a New York gallery. Sasha has led an idyllic life of sorts, married to Arthur Boardman for 25 years, the mother of two wonderful children, and a career she loves. Her life predictably falls apart by Arthur's sudden death. Months after Arthur's death, Sasha finally meets Liam Allison, a wacky artist, and friend of her beloved son Xavier. One bothersome editorial note is the distracting and excessive use of the word \\"wacky\\" when describing Liam.  However, it is a just description of a very immature, and out of control artist like Liam. Sasha, such a conservative, quiet person, never predicted she would fall in love with this man so opposite from herself. Sasha is irresistibly drawn to him but has so many doubts she pushes him away multiple times. Nevertheless the novel ends in Danielle Steel's typical style.  <br />  <br />	2005-03-02

Along the way, Amy, however falls in love with Lord Richard Selwick, also known as the Purple Gentian. Sometimes, the story loses its luster with Amy not figuring out right away that Richard was the Purple Gentian, and his mother's involvement in rescuing him from the police at the end.

Rebecca is writing her thesis for her postdoctoral degree on the influences of television on families in the 1970s. Amidst the flashbacks to her childhood, when Rebecca inserts her husband Alistair's scientific opinions about one's DNA it drags down the well-told story. Every time Alistair appears you question why did she marry him?  Rebecca's childhood habit of reading the dictionary comes into play at the start of every chapter. The whimsical inserts of words and their definitions are distracting at times. Family tree is the story of three generations of women and the men they married and the ones they loved. The national fervor for the 1981 wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana pushes the Arnold household into a crazed frenzy and to the brink. It is heartwarming to see the love between generations, and it is easy to be empathetic to those with broken relationships.

People seem to be either overjoyed or devastated by the murder.  Kim Kelly cannot take the pressure and meets an untimely end.  Sonya reluctantly figures out who is the murderer by realizing who is connected to all those involved.  The action moves quickly, though in some instances not well thought out. The reader is kept on edge by several characters having motives.  The editing is lacking in this book, and even has one glaring error near the end.  A superficial, whodunit mystery when you want something light to read.	2004-11-13

They both turn to Tanner Kingsley, Kingsley CEO, for support. Tanner is gracious and extends his sympathies to the women but is venomous in his intentions once they leave. He has very evil, greedy and selfish motives regarding all personal and business matters.

You are able to learn the childhood reason behind Kelly being afraid of the dark. However, there are many times in the story where a character's behavior can only be described as awkward and you the reader feel lost. There are too many separate stories when you first start out.

Her life is turned upside down when her former boss, and lover, Erza Lapufsky reappears in her life and offers her the job she has dreamed of for years, being a part of the Secret Service detail.  Not the President but guarding the First Lady.  At first, Quinn does not want it at all thinking it was a babysitting job and tries to make all sorts of unreasonable demands to push Erza away.  Erza is the Acting Associate Director of the FBI, and not one to give up and gets Quinn to agree to the deal.  Her fianc Alex Duval just happens to be up for the nomination of FBI Director.  The comparisons between her old lover and new are so pointedly opposite that it seems fake.  It just so happens that her Aunt Birdie is a friend with the first Lady, Letty Jaye.  Quinn and her best friend Sadie join the Secret Service for three months. Very bothersome to me is the First Lady calling Quinn and Sadie \\"girls\\".  Calling non-family members, grown women, and members of the Secret Service \\"girls\\" seems condescending and a little much.  They learn that Lettie Jaye believes there is an imposter standing in for her husband as President of the United States.  No one believes her but her complaints and her persistence start to make sense to Quinn and Sadie.  The First Lady demands to go home to Charleston, South Carolina for the holidays.  With the help of her beloved housekeeper Cassie, the first lady, Quinn, and Sadie escape from the Secret Service. Mrs. Jaye demands her husband back.  You can almost guess the happily ever after ending.  This book was a real disappointment.	2004-09-24
