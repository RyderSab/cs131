I picked this book on a whim and was quite impressed with the quality of the text and research.   The history is punctuated with anecdotes, and though the writing is a bit sluggish, I felt this is a valuable account of Roman military history nonetheless.  Further, I found it to be accurate to the best of my knowledge, and though I am no expert, I am very interested in Rome and military history. One reviewer below claims the entire book is bogus and I would be interested if he pointed out the flaws he finds.  Highly reccommended.	2002-07-09

As I said, this novel is definitely slow-paced, so for those whose attention spans are shorter than the average television commercial, you are being forewarned.<BR>That aside, this is an absolutely marvelous book, combining elements of mystery and crime with disturbing psychology and provocative philosophy. The story concerns a poor Russian youth named Raskalnikov who has decided that murdering an elderly pawnbroker for her wealth is just because she is a societal leech who contributes nothing. He is blinded by his own poverty and deluded by his Neitzschean philosophy concerning 'extraordinary men' and their rights to commit heinous acts for the general betterment of humanity. Problems arise when he falls in love and is also hounded by two men, one a police officer and another a scoundrel. <BR>The story is well-translated in that it is clear and concise, and, by all accounts, preserves the story nicely. The writing itself is readable, and the more philosophical passages are definitely intriguing.<BR>Highly reccomended.	2002-02-25

This anime is the best I have read, and it is very well-constructed and concieved. The artwork is superb, truly something to enjoy, even after the fifth reading. The stories are hilarious for the most part, though some of the more recent editions have stories that are not as amusing. However, I don't find these to be very frequent, and the ideas and jokes are very original. Oftentimes, there is even some suspense, further enhancing the overall comic.

This is a book of ambitious scope and its thesis is very thought-provoking and controversial. While I certainly cannot agree with many of the entries, the rankings of many people over others and several notable omissions, I do not feel my personal preferences should detract from the quality of the book. In fact, the author should be applauded for his ambition, and the amount of research he must have conducted (though, the research was fairly shallow). <BR>The book also serves as a good reference tool, with which to get a basic background in many important historical figures of great importance. <BR>Reccommended.	2002-02-21

No doubt THE LORD OF THE RINGS set the tone for all modern fantasy fiction, and certainly the story herein has been much imitated by the talented and talentless, and no doubt this is a good story. For those reasons, LORD OF THE RINGS is awarded 3 stars.<br />But...<br />There are two things about this trilogy which drive me insane, and I am wondering if I am the only one. First, Tolkein is so long-winded, spending pages (literally!) describing scenery, which is interesting to a point, quickly bores me as being unnecessary. Teachers in every writing class have told me to cut to the chase, not to be too long-winded; so why is Tolkein never criticized for his lack of an editor?<br />Secondly, and far more importantly, is the underlying racism that pervades this trilogy. I hate to say this about a book so venerated to my favorite genre, but the racism of Tolkein set the tone for the next 50+ years in terms of the racism that was (and still is) so prevalent in the fantasy genre. His descriptions of orcs resembles 13th-century descriptions of Mongols, giving them no redeeming factors at all. I realize that the 1950s weren't the most politically correct times, but Tolkein was an academic, and I feel he has a responsibility to fight this sort of mindless drivel. He was a professor at Oxford, so he likely understood what he was writing, and that makes what he wrote all the more galling. This racism in my eyes almost negates all the positives of this trilogy, but I am a fair person and give it some credit.<br />Reccommended, but understand what you are reading.	2002-02-21

This book is a good one, though it would seem to fit an earlier era of historical writing, rather than the early 21st-century. Keay is a good writer and does a good job of stringing together a vast amount of information, while generally keeping it interesting. However, his Euro-centrism is a little disturbing and very obnoxious.

First of all I foundt this translation to be clear and readable, something that I have come to expect from Michael Grant.   But the material is what baffles me.  Cicero is considered the greatest Latin orator and writer, having a concise and interesting style.  Personally, I find him to be very long-winded, and I realize this is due to a shortened attention span, but nonetheless, he could have made many of his points with two examples instead of ten.    I also find it ironic that Cicero paints himself to be the epitome of Republican Roman values, a man who stood completely for the decrepit and dying Roman Republic.  Yet, he was a great friend of Pompey, a man who's goal it was to acquire dictatorial power, albeit within the confines of Republic. Pompey's actions over the year also consistently undermined the strength of the Republic, whereas Caesar acted legally throughout his career, until his enemies backed him into a corner and an untenable situation.    Yet Cicero sides with Pompey over Caesar, for no especially good reason. Cicero was a brilliant orator and lawyer, but as a politician, his ambitions and sense of self-importance far, far outstripped his abilities. Cicero's allies were a self-centered lot of aristocrats, who ran Rome for their personal benefit rather than for the benefit of Rome. Quite frankly, a man with as strong a sense of justice as Cicero should have supported the more inclusive Caesarian politics; that he did not, is a shame for him.   Regardless, this reading is chiefly for people interested in ancient history, and starry-eyed idealists.  Mildly reccommended.	2002-02-21

This book is a superb introduction into a country that has been misrepresented and misunderstood for a long time (though not so much in the modern day). It gives a concise and interesting overview of Japanese history to the modern day, and does so while providing enough information to give the reader a solid grasp of the subject matter. From here, the reader can easily move onto specific areas of interest, because they will likely know some of the major events/people associated with that time period. Or if they are not particularly interested with Japanese history, they will walk away with a rudimentary understanding of this amazing country's history.<BR>Further, I did not detect any significant bias on the part of the author, though I am not an expert in the subject matter, so my opinion is an amateur one.<BR>Highly reccommended.	2002-02-21

First of all, I do not read comic books, I am simply familiar with many of the more famous ones and enjoy the superhero mythos portrayed in comic books.<BR>I generally hesitate in considering most comic books as anything other than pulp fiction with graphics, but &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; is on a level all its own.  The main story is a struggle between the 'old guard' of DC superheroes (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and many, many others) and a new group of superheroes who are far more violent and far less principled than their esteemed forebears.  This struggle brings up a host of issues, which I will not delve into, because of the length of time involved in such a discussion.<BR>But what makes this superb story even better is the unbelievable artwork of Alex Ross, which looks like sculpture on canvas, vividly painted and beautifully realized.  The characters are gorgeously rendered and the artwork alone makes this a worthwhile purchase for the average comic book reader and even the casual fan of the superhero mythos.<BR>Highly reccomended.	2002-02-19

Plutarch provides a superb history concerning the decline and collapse of the Roman Republic, following the lives of Sulla, Marius, Crassus, Pompey, Caesar and Cicero.  The first five were very powerful soldiers aspiring to the position of dictator, and the final was perhaps the greatest Latin orator and a lawyer of unparalleled skill.  The history is very thorough and definitely worth reading.<BR>However, Plutarch's writing leaves much to be desired.  It is slow and dull for the most part, and he provides few insights into what he is writing...he only recounts facts and does not even bother trying to analyze the situation.  This can be good, but it makes for dull reading and you finish the book feeling as if you had just read a textbook.<BR>Recommended for people very interested in this period, or amateur historians, but not for the lay reader.	2002-02-14

It adds up to give the reader one of the finest works of fantasy fiction to date. <BR>The story chiefly concerns two characters, Alfred and Haplo, who belong to opposing races that are very hostile to each other.  Yet, they forge a formidable friendship and set about saving the world.<BR>Yes, the plot is decidedly generic, but the power of this cycle lies in the superb character development, and interesting side plots (each of the first four books contributes to the overriding plot, but mainly concern other stories), as well as the fluid and interesting writing.  There are also several innovations made into their concept of fantasy, as well as a very, very well-developed world, showing the love and care the authors put into this story.<BR>The entire series is very good, though I think the first five were the best, with the last two still being very good, but dropping off somewhat from the first five.<BR>Highly recommended.	2002-02-13

Fuller presents a superb book on Alexander the Great, arguably the greatest figure in military history in recorded history. The book is very concise and well-written, with fluid language, that rarely, if ever, bogs down the reader. His descriptions are clear and very detailed, and he makes very clear what sources he is drawing from. The analysis especially was insightful and interesting.<BR>What I find most engaging about this book, however, is the fact that Fuller minimizes his awe of Alexander, avoiding the praises and demigod status some historians attribute to Alexander, and fairly showing his darker side. He also fairly represents the Persians, painting them not as incompetent, so much as simply overmatched and then overwhelmed.<BR>Highly reccomended.	2002-02-08

This novel and its two follow-ups (&quot;Lord of the Fire Lands&quot; and &quot;Sky of Swords&quot;) represent some of the best of the pulp fantasy genre.  The story is well-concieved, not only here but in the next two novels as well. The common thread is tied together in a fun, if cheesy and somewhat predictable, ending as depicted in the third book. Further, the characterization is superb, as Duncan introduces the reader to so many characters and manages to develop in them in an efficient and succinct manner.<BR>But the trilogy is really special because the writing is so very good, far superior to the usual pulp fantasy, as represented by much of the later Conan (Howard's and Jordan's Conan is superb, but much of the rest is horrible), most of Salvatore's work (with the exception of some of the Drizzt novels) and the muck of others.

This is really shaping up to be some saga...I just hope Mr. Martin doesn't crash and burn as the other 'venerable' authors of the day have (read: Jordan and Goodkind, who need to be end the pain of their readers, and fast). <BR>At any rate, this novel picks up where the last one left off in story (duh) and in spirit, with new twists and turns, more gore, quite a few more surprises and many hours of contentment.<BR>The story is rife with intrigue, and supposedly minor things that occurred in the first book are just now taking seed and it makes the story all the more complicated.<BR>In that way, the novel is very realistic with endless factions and scheming and every person working only for their own gain. There are no good people in this book, everyone is flawed and while that is depressing, it is also very true to life (how many paragons have you met recently--I've met two my whole life).<BR>Plus, if you're a history major, the book is chock full of historical parallels and little tweaks on various historical groups (for example, the Unsullied seem to be the perfected Roman Legionary).<BR>Highest, highest reccommendation.	2001-12-12

The fact that Mr. Farland (acutally Wolverton) feels the need to bring this style of fantasy back to life is disappointing and, frankly, pathetic. I have no problem borrowing from history and drawing historical parallels to particular races, peoples or events. In fact, I enjoy the writing more when there is some underlying message. But the kind of borrowing Mr. Farland does is completely blatant and unoriginal (I mean at least fiddle with the names a little). We haven't had the brown people play bad guys before, nor portrayed them as cruel and bloodthirsty; the West is far too fair for that. <BR>While the book did have its high points, the undertones are far too obnoxious to continue this at-best-mediocre series.<BR>Not reccommended.	2001-12-11

John Keegan is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors, and with good reason. &quot;History of Warfare&quot; and &quot;The First World War&quot; were tremendous books, with fantastic research and probably the best writing I've read from many a history writer (it's fluid, concise with only the occassional straying, and precise).<BR>This book details what Keegan considers to be the four major styles of leadership, using Alexander the Great to personify Heroic Leadership, the Duke of Wellington as the Anti-Hero, Ulysses S. Grant as the Un-Hero and Adolph Hitler as the False Hero.<BR>The history is very well researched, and the discussion very interesting.

This is where Graves' writing talent really shines as he describes his various horrid experiences in and out of the trenches, his marriage and his family's life, all with fluid writing and calm remembarance. It is probably the greatest World War I memoir in terms of depth and quality of writing and is chock full of interesting information for the amateur or serious historian, but also tells a very intersting and poignant story of one man's experiences in the defining event of the 20th-century.<BR>Highly reccommended.	2001-12-10

I really dislike romantic writing because I find it dull and sappy, and some of the overtures of 'pleasurable' rape depicted in many of these novels is disturbing.<BR>On the other hand, I do love fantasy fiction, worlds abounding with magic and antiquity. <BR>The utterly romantic outlook of this book from start to finish is refreshing in a genre that is often rather emotion-less and Haydon's writing is superb in bringing out the emotions of the reader (I think reading this has brought me to the closest I've been to tearing up in many years). <BR>The plot is superbly crafted and it will keep you guessing (partly because you really don't meet the antagonist so have no way of laying the blame on them), the character development is also well-done though I thought Grunthor did not recieve as much attention as Rhapsody and Achmed.  Achmed's character in particular was excellent, as he too seems to have prescient abilities that are hinted at from the start and loosely confirmed at the end.<br />This comes with my highest recommendations, and is a superb read while awaiting the fantasy epics.	2001-11-27

I find the ignorance of some of the reviewers below to be obscene. Obviously they have not read much about Islamic religious practices, nor about the just treatment of many Muslim conquerors to their new subjects (there are specific rules in the Shariya laid out for the proper treatment of non-Muslim subjects, and I can assure you they are not to butcher them nor treat them like animals). Yes, these empires were gained through bloodshed, but which empires were not? The Greeks, Romans, French, British, Spanish, Portugese, Germans and the rest certainly did not gain their place in history by sitting on their hands or aweing people with their cultural achievements. I wonder how many of the conquered felt when they were subjugated by the Europeans in the Age of Discovery through the colonial era? Perhaps as if they were being terrorized? Or even being cruelly used and treated?<br />To blame Islam for the actions of a small number of extremists who are who are actually working for political goals is ludicrous; by that rationale, Christianity is the worst religion of all. It has been repeatedly said that Muslims do not tolerate criticism. That is inaccurate; we tolerate criticism, when it is done correctly. I challenge people to critique the faith based on the sayings of the Prophet and the Qur'an. I challenge you to see that the 'successors' of the Prophet are not necessarily the best representatives of Islam, and that they are people, flawed as much as any of us. It is unjust, indeed ignorant, to take the practices of the Talibanand unilaterally equate them with Islam; Taliban practices are based on the tribal laws of the Afghani tribes, laws that have existed longer than Islam, and are condoned by Islam. Besides, mistreatment of women is un-Islamic, and it should be noted that harsh practices against women are often based off tribal practices.In any event, it is ridiculous to say that Islamic peoples are evil and that their faith preaches evil. Why would so many people follow a religion that was 'evil'? Why would people in this country and so many others, intelligent people, convert to Islam if it were evil? Let me pose a question: what culture, what faith has enslaved or exploited the most people, spawned the most wars, the most death, the most destruction in all of human history? Bar none, it is the West and its supposedly peaceful Christian ideology that has done these things (just take the casualty rates of the last century as an indicator).y event, it is ridiculous to say that Islamic peoples are evil and that their faith preaches evil.

The writing is superb, woven together seamlessly thanks to Graves' outstanding skill.  Additionally, the characterization is interesting, if a little on the flat side.  However, Graves compensates by weaving a beautiful tapestry of Imperial Rome, one that is largely historically accurate, making this a novel useful to the amateur historian, as well the casual or serious reader.  <br />The subtelties of the novel are also interesting as Graves comments on the corruption of Empire versus Republic, sending a clear message to a shattered Europe, suffering through the after effects of World War I.  <br />A must-read for history lovers, but highly recommended for all.	2001-10-18

My interest in the Thomas Ripley saga was first piqued by the movie of the same name which was quite fun to watch. But the power of the book lies in what Matt Damon cannot, despite his superb acting, illumine: what is happening inside Ripley's mind. <BR>The book begins by establishing Ripley's character, and some of his past, and continues on to the story of how impoverished Tom Ripley hobnobs with the wealthy Dickie Greenleaf, murders him, assumes Dickie's identity, and escapes the clutches of justice, if barely. The story itself is rivetting, rife with detail that brings Europe alive. But the most fascinating part is the case study into the mind of a nihilist, and I feel this work to be on par with the another great study of nihilism: Dostoyevsky's &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. <BR>Bottom line: read it, but don't expect the movie.	2001-10-03

I, CLAUDIUS is easily one of the finest crafted historical fiction novels I have read, on par with Clavell's SHOGUN and Eco's NAME OF THE ROSE. <br />The novel concerns the pre-Imperator days of Claudius, and how he manages to survive his loveless family as well as the deaths of much of his family to become Imperator in 41 AD. The book is superbly written, the plot is well-crafted and enticing, the characterization excellent and the book itself is simply a fantastical read. <br />Beyond just good writing and a good story, I, CLAUDIUS brings up questions of morality, shows a variety of human vices and can be used as segue into ancient Roman history. All in all a complete package.	2001-08-15

Mr. Cornwell is an excellent storyteller who weaves a wonderful tale of the Arthurian legend in a very unconventional light. The  story is narrated by one of Arthur's closest friends and best warriors,  Derfel Cadarn.  Derfel was a Saxon raised as a Briton and was taught the  Druidic faith.  The story moves along at an interesting pace, until, of  course, Arthur shows and things really pick up.   I do not wish to ruin it  for you, but I highly recommend this book to people who enjoy a good book  about a tale they think they know. ENJOY!	2000-05-12

I do not read much poetry of any kind, but I read this book for school project and found it to be very different from the poetry I am usually forced to read in school...there was none of the traditional meter, rhyme  schemes nor any of the usual symbols that are used commonly with more  European oriented poetry. All in all, it was interesting and refreshing  poetry and I enjoyed reading it and attempting to analyze it.	2000-04-17

A &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; is the sequel to &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; and a very worthy sequel it is.  It serves more intrigue, politics, horrific bloodshed and superb writing.  The book is packed with  suspense and fantastic characters, and not all the likable characters are  'good' or 'bad'.  Anyways, buy the book, read the book, love the book and  wait for &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;.	1999-07-24

It is light years ahead of The Wheel of Time and Sword of Truth. The story weaves a complicated web of intrigue and politics, of honor and dishonor,  and of treachery and truth.  The book honestly draws you in quickly and  leaves you hanging. You will come to respect, love and loathe most of the  characters, and find yourself begging for more. Alas, this seems to be one  of those long epics...let us hope Martin does not burn out as Jordan did.  Read and love this book.	1999-06-06

The book creates another fantastic plot that sucks you in, gives  you more well-crafted characters and loads of intrigue. Another fantastic  read and a worthwhile book for the old fantasy fiction collection.	1999-06-06

I have to honestly say that the first book in this series was okay at times, dull at others and excellent at yet other parts. The fact is, this book sets up the entire rest of this series, and is necessary in order to  read the REALLY good Recluce books. Read it (or get through it) and then  enjoy the nnext couple of books.	1999-04-10

This series has it all... adventure, politics, romance and action, all at just the right spots. The series takes on a new depth as Modesitt begins taking in the view of the White Wizards of  Fairhaven and showing their motivations. The Colors of Chaos is a powerful  addition to a wonderful series. Read them all and buy them all...they are  definitely ones for the collection.	1999-04-06

I would like to begin by saying that I give this book four and a half stars not five. It is a good conclusion and Williams did a good job tying up loose ends but it was too long. The ending was unlike other fantasy  fiction novels in the sense that for once the good guy's triumph was not  inevitable and he had to be saved by someone else. A series worthy of a  place on the old bookshelf.	1999-03-23

The second book of Williams' epic &quot;Memory, Sorrow and Thorn&quot; is better than the first because it moves faster and adds much to the plot of the overall series. There is more action seen in this book as well as lots  of interesting plot development. However, the book is once again bogged  down by too much description and detail. Nonetheless it is a book that is  worth the money of fantasy readers.	1999-03-23

This is one of those fantasy fiction novels that is read and reread and loved by many. It is a new-age fantasy fiction novel--the antithesis to the enjoyable, but repetitive, sword-and-sorcery novels, such as Conan and  Lankhmar. This book deals more with the politics and thought than the blood  and gore. Anyways, READ IT...it will be classic fantasy...as much as the  Lord of the Rings is.	1999-03-18

The &quot;Sword&quot; may very well be a rip off of the  &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, but this definitely isn't.

I was very impressed with the book, even though it bore a resemblance to the sword-and-sorcery fantasy fiction such as Conan, which I am not fond of.  Ms. Wurts creates an interesting character in Korendir that is so different  from the lecherous Conan.

This book intrigued me when I bought it and I finished it rather quickly. The idea of the series in itself is quite good, but the book, indeed the entire series (except for the last half of &quot;To Green Angel  Tower&quot;) moves too slowly. Like Tolkein, Williams is ever toooo  descriptive and slows a good story down too much. None the less, it is a  worthwhile read for any fantasy reader looking for a good read, and the  rest of the series makes up for the slowness of this book.	1999-01-16
