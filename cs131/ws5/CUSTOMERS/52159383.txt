Our guide is the murdered girl herself, an intelligent and open-minded narrator called Susie Salmon. She is in heaven and able to follow the living liberally. <br />During most of the book, which takes place during the days, weeks, and months after the tragedy, Susie paints a harrowing portrait of how different community members cope.  Among those featured: The grieving father's coddling of his youngest son, the lead detective's sincere-- but clumsy-- investigation, and the murderer's glee and utter professionalism as he disposes the dead girl's body. We are also treated to a sweet depiction of Susie's heaven: it is tailored made for her and filled with<BR>favorite things from her days on earth. <br />Towards the end, the author looses her cool. Her editor must have been on vacation (there is no other explanation)  and, consequently,  we are treated to a glorious meltdown:<br /> * Susie's narration, which was engaging and true to a teenager,<BR>suddenly sounds as erudite as a graduate student consulting   with her dissertation adviser.  <BR> * Her knowledge of sexual facts (in practice and theory) would  make Dr. Ruth blush.<BR> * A high school friend mingles with Susie's spirit and, after<BR>graduating from high school, moves to New York, sports an all-black wardrobe, visits heaven (don't ask me how) and preaches to dead people about dying (don't ask me why, or how-- it's a surprise!)<br />I encourage everyone to read this book. It must have been impossible, after such a beguiling start, to find a resonant ending. My suggestion:<BR> <BR>Once the narrative starts jumping years stop reading and call it a book,otherwise be brave and trudge-on.	2002-09-27

The Liars' Club highlights the traits of a household ruled by alcohol: the sudden maturity young children must demonstrate, the outcast status these children have to deal with in the community, and the futility they feel as parents waste their parental and vocational gifts.<BR> <BR>Don't miss this extraordinary book. Mary Karr is a professor at Syracuse University, and a poet. No wonder, all characters feel real and are not a collection of tics and eccentricities which populate many current books. Her economical use of metaphors and similes keeps this memoir free of platitudes masquerading as life lessons. When the metaphors come they mean something. Mary Karr and her older sister are not portrayed as saintly or innocent: They are precocious, stubborn, and cynical.<br />When parents are unavailable, when children are forced to become de-facto parents, when the same children are repeatedly submitted to beatings and other punitive actions for no apparent reason, a skeptical soul may be the only road to adulthood.	2002-09-08

I don't know the basics about horses and avoid equestrian articles in the sports section. Seabiscuit, however, takes us on a fascinating ride: We experience the great fire that demolished San Francisco, we have house seats during the battle between horses and cars for transportation supremacy (the parallels between the early days of cars and the current cell-phone age are unavoidable and unsettling), and we stroll the streets<BR>of Tijuana during its heyday a refuge from Prohibition.<BR> <BR>The protagonists are recognizably human and, in different ways, heroic. Even the moody and stubborn Seabiscuit is described with empathy. The narrative style is friendly and conversational, and the ending is unexpectedly moving.  <BR> <BR>Seabiscuit has presided over the New York Times Bestsellers List for a while now, and there are plans for a movie. Maybe the film version will be effective. But do yourself a favor, treat yourself to this extraordinary tale before your first impression of Seabiscuit is a compromised, one-step removed film version.	2002-08-08

One of the threads--a series of letters and a narrative by a<BR> sensitive Ukrainian-- is at once moving and hilarious. <BR> <BR> Other narratives (which explore the history, myths, and development of a<BR> small village) are burdened with one-dimensional characters who experience<BR> supernatural occurrences-- these story-lines are an awkward mix of<BR> Gabriel Garcia Marquez's mythical communities and Isaac Bashevis Singer's<BR> old European tales.

There is no way to confirm the veracity of Ms. Shields meditation, but it doesn't matter.<br />If the &quot;Jane Austen&quot; exhibited, in this enthralling member of the Penguin-Lipper &quot;Lives&quot; series, is a character who is purely Carol Shields' creation, she is fascinating: ironic, observant, and razor sharp.<br />In most books from the &quot;Lives&quot; series, the reader acquires not only an appretiation of the subject matter, but becomes familiar with the personality, open-minded analysis, and ethusiasm of the author. <br />Carol Shields is a terrific guide through Jane Austen's sensibilities and accomplishments.	2002-04-14

A brief sample: we travel south with the Weils as they flee Germany's invasion of France, spend time with the revels during the Spanish civil war, and receive an unflinching description of factory life in mid-century France.  <br />Furthermore, Du Plessix Gray's examination inspires conflicting feelings towards Weil. Sometimes I felt admiration for her intellectual bravery and exhaustive examination of dangerous factory life. At other times her fixation with masochistic actions, manipulation of friends, stubborn personality, and, worse of all, her rabid anti-semitism makes Simone Weil hard to take seriously.<br />This meditation of a short, but action-packed life, is a rewarding and thought-provoking read.	2002-03-27

The characters are engaging and true to life.  However, in the hurried action movie like ending all of the  characters lose their dimensions in a silly action-movie like sequence. We  are left with mixed messages, half-explored issues, and a nagging sensation  that the author lost his nerve and took the easy way out.	1999-05-30

Unfortunately, the portraits of the most important men in her life( father,  husband) is sketchy and guarded.  Maybe now that Ms. Reichl doesn't have to  hide her identity anymore, she will write a second volume that is not as  muted.	1999-05-30

This hard to understand and self-indulgent meditation holds a lot of promise. However, the reader gets lost in a sticky world of SAT words and muddy thoughts as soon as he/she opens the book.  Good luck.	1998-12-24

I've learned a lot about, and gained respect, for many culinary creations that I previously knew very little  about.  However, it is also dispiriting. For example, I am now discouraged  from eating any American Oysters(according to Mr. Rosengarten, the only  good ones are from France), and his chapter on Pecan Pie, betrays a palate  that is maybe a little narrow and judgemental.  In short, althought very  informative, &quot;Taste&quot; left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.	1998-12-06

This book makes you think, but it is so skillfully and beautifully written that it is without pretention.  It asks questions about writing and literature and art and life, but it is above all a page-turning mystery set  in New York City.  I always wanted to know what would happen next, but the  language was so beautiful that I was content no matter how much or how  little of the actions were actually explained.  I recommend this to all  mystery-lovers, all New Yorkers, and anyone who loves to read.  This book  may turn you into a bit of an existentialist, but it will do so with a  great sense of humor.	1998-12-06

By focusing on the Ali-Liston battles, &quot;King of the World&quot; paints vivid and unforgettable portraits of not only Ali, but Liston and Patterson. This is a fun read, and the most memorable book on Boxing since  Thomas Hauser's book on the same topic.	1998-12-05
