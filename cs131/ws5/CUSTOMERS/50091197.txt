All the characters are vey likable and the scenes very well described.	2002-06-03

I had only heard of this King through Shakespeare's play, but this time I was able to really learn about his life, his contemporaries and his heritage.  <br />Ms. Dunnett has a very special way to write about her characters that keeps the reader thinking.  Her writing could be considered outstanding, being very intelligent and taking always into consideration all the many different currents that run through everybody's life, specially that of a King.<br />A very enjoyable read.	2002-06-03

What I found very clever is the combination of the story of Egypt in two different eras that we learn through one person reading her great-grandmother's journal. I have to say it kept me reading to find out what happened.<br />One thing that has made me appreciate this book even more is the importance of keeping a diary.... our heirs will always be interested in reading how our live was.....!	2002-05-02

The author tries to present all the peoples, countries and events that will interact once the conflict starts.<br />However, it is my opinion, that he overcharges the book with technical detail.  I understand that today's war are mostly technical, but reading about the different types of bombs that used to exist and the new ones, as well as tanks that were and are, does tend to make the book slow and stops the flow of the story.<br />All in all, it is a very interesting read.	2002-04-23

In this book the author chooses a passage from the original story about a girl/queen who suffers from the loss of her brothers and husband and falls under the protection of Achilles and Patroclus his longtime friend.<br />The book is very well written and the author has been able to bring to life a part of history that has always been hard to imagine.  The scenes, as well as customs in everyday life are extremely life-like as well as her characters.  The detail on the war is also very alive and easy to follow.<br />All in all, a very good book, easy to read and very instructional.	2002-04-11

It brings to life an aspect of the life lived in the mid 1600's that has really never been presented so openly.  <br />It is true that under King Louis XIV, the &quot;Sun King&quot;, life was very hard for the common people, while at Court, life was extremely frivolous.  But in this book it shows the extent people were willing to go to live in, and be accepted by, that Court.<br />Very interesting book full of detail and very lively characters.	2002-04-04

It combines details of war and specifics on ship handling with human interactions under such &quot;close quarters&quot; and romantic relationships.  It is all written in a way that never feels overly detailed and the reader just wants to learn more.<br />The central theme, the &quot;mutiny&quot; is very cleverly worked up to and during the event, it is very well presented in parts so as not to seem too boring.  <br />This is definitely a classic.	2002-04-04

But the author uses it to increase the elements in her plot.  It works very well, since it kept me hooked until the last page!  <br />I was very taken by the way she compares life in the &quot;future&quot; and life in late Twentieth Century America.<br />All in all, a good easy read.	2002-03-14

I know life sometimes is hard on someone, but this is taking it to the extreme.  I tried to empathize with the main character, Alice, especially after she suffered the drowning of her neighbor's daughter, but I could not accept her reaction and even less the incredible turn around she goes through once she is imprisoned.<br />Maybe this means this author is very good to create such reaction in me?  But I thought the aim of reading was to enjoy oneself and it did not happen for me here.<br />All that happened in this book to one person, could have filled three books.	2002-03-14

It is a true historical novel, since I learned a lot about Irish history of the times, and also came to very much like Brian of Boruma and all that he felt and accomplished for his country.<br />The characters are vey alive and real and all the facts presented, like wars, marriages are very well presented and not boring to read.

Many totally innocent people were accused and burned during those times, but I was not ready to find the story of cult followers to &quot;the goddess&quot; and their fight against the enemy.<br />Even though the story is interesting and the plot holds till the end of the book, it sometimes felt too mystical and surreal.  You don't know whether to take this book as a faithfull recount of those times and situations or as a fantasy set in historical times.<br />However, the book is entertaining and well written.  All characters are alive and interesting and the places and situations are very well described.	2002-03-06

The book is very well researched and some of the things presented, like the letters Hanssen sent to the Russians, are totally amazing.  The idea to present both lives in parallel, between Freeh and Hanssen is brilliant because it gives the book and additional angle, the way two people from similar backgrounds can play their lives in totally different ways and succeed or not in their endeavors.<br />On the other hand, the content of the book is mind-blowing.  How can someone live with himself knowing they are practically destroying a country and all to feel better about themselves, to feel in control?  And his obsession with this wife and pornography is also nauseating.  I do not understand how can his wife still visit him after knowing everything he did to her.<br />This is a must read, only to learn what the extent of evil in some people and how it has consequences still  years later.	2002-03-06

I had never read anything from this author before and I was imediately immersed in the story.<br />The story, though based on the life of Melisende, the first daughter of King Baldwin of Jerusalem, has enough fiction to make it easily readable and very captivating.<br />The author has been able to recreate the romantic atmosphere of the times, with Knights fighting for the \\"true\\" religion and<BR>women who had the courage and character to be true Kings, but could not for their sex.<br />All characters are so vividly described, you cannot but feel you know them and want to find out what happens to them.  The places are very well described and feel as real and ancient as they are.<br />All in all, a very good book and very enjoyable.	2002-02-27

I am able to understand the Arab position, as well as Israel's.  <br />Also, I have learned part of the history on that area, from the beginning of last century, through both world wars and with the situation now. How all the ancient civilizations that dominated the area left their mark, how the Jews were forced to leave and how Islam became the ever-present religion. <br />The book is written from an Arab's point of view and that is very refreshing, as well as insightful into their minds and way of thinking.<br />Good book and a must read in today's world.	2002-01-30

Only Jamie knows.<br />The author has once again captured and transmitted to us how everyday live must have been in those times and to be able to compare it (through Claire and Brianna) to present day life.

His story is told to Jason, a juror, by Polemides.  He was the man charged of assasinating Alcibiades.<br />Although I found some parts too descriptive of the fighting and hard to follow, all in all I enjoyed reading this book.

The story, though centralized in the Peloponnesian Wars, also describes the way people let their lives and how they suffered also.  <br />I am a big fan of all historical novels, and this one was no exception.<br />Good reading and very informative.	2001-11-27

A woman who not only had to fight all her life for real recognition of her art in a man's world, but she was also raped and had to suffer through a long trial to see her name cleared.  On the other hand, she was compared, to the day she died, to her father, Orazio Gentileschi, who taught her everything she knew of painting.<br />The life of Artemisia had enough elements to make this book interesting, but the author was able to present very clearly and accurately the thinking of the times, the 1600's Italy, specially in regards to women painters and mostly women who had been raped.<br />The characters are very well presented as well as the customs of the times, in Rome, Florence and Naples, and later in her life, London.<br />Very good read.	2001-11-05

She has achieved a remarkably well written &quot;autobiography&quot;.  You do feel as if you are reading Josephine's thoughts and emotions and living alongside her all the many things, good and bad, that happen to her.  <br />If you love historical novels, this is a very good book.	2001-10-04

Destiny will put her cousin Nora in her path and with her she will find a new life, a new look and peace in her.<br />The plot is interesting enough but somehow it does not grip you like other novels by the author.  She places the story in the south, close to Atlanta in a small town in the 1960's a time of great changes in this area.  The people are also interesting and their characters are well described.<br />It is an easy novel to read but I somehow got used to reading books from this author with the caliber of a &quot;Peachtree Road&quot;, and I don't see it here.	2001-09-12

US	50091197	RWLNGDAYSDF17	0684809184	534371781	The Gold of Exodus	Books	4	2	3	N	N	my review	This is a recount of the expedition of two men, Larry Williams and Bob Cornuke, to discover the &quot;true&quot; Mount Sinai.<br />The book in itself is very interesting.  The author has written it as a novel and, therefore, very easy to read.  It is hard to imagine this is a true story.<br />What has surprised me the most that I had never heard of this event.  A discovery of this importance should have made headlines all around the world, yet it did not even appear on a special documentary on television.  <br />But it has certainly strengthened my belief in the Bible.  I also view it as a real description of events and not only as literature.	2001-08-16
US	50091197	R39P86H5NEM90D	0738830127	260617312	Angel Chickens	Books	4	0	0	N	N	my review	Russo Weaver is a woman who must protect her child and herself from harm from her husband.  She is able to find peace and happiness as well as love from total strangers in a little town in Illinois, miles away from her home.<br />She builds her life there, but she finally succumbs to disease.<br />The story in this book may be one that we have heard one too many times, but the way the author writes it and describes the characters and their feelings makes it all worthwhile.  She writes with tenderness and makes you feel like you are living Russo's life while she tells of it during her last days.  You become familiar with Cookie and Shirley and Sandy and Magda and Yoc and also her son, Trooper.  At the end, I felt Troopers tears and I mingled them with my own.<br />I recommend this book to all who love and care.	2001-08-07

He is again faced with many obstacles, and his enemies as still out &quot;to get him&quot;.  He finds peace in the end but it also comes at a high price.<br />I have given one less star for this book, because I think the author spends too much time in this book detailing Scottish history when it is not the main subject.  It is certainly interesting but, she could have done what she did for all the other countries, where she only gave us a brief summary that enabled us to comprehend the complexities of &quot;foreign policies&quot; during that period.<br />I still have rarely enjoyed reading a hostorical novel so much.  I was raised in Europe, and always felt very familiar with the places, names and people.  Every scene was detailed and very entertaining and always the plot has been very well thought-out and very intelligent.	2001-08-07

Be it about European history as well as middle eastern. <br />I am on my way to reading the sixth book...	2001-07-17

In this book we are introduced, not only to the main character, Claes or Nicholas, but also to everything that is going on in the middle of the 15th century.  We learn about Bruges, the center of trade for all of northern Europe, of Milan, Geneva, and the way business and trade was done in those days.<br />I grew up in Brussels, therefore I feel very close to the main setting of this book, as well as the history of the region.  But also, the book just draws you into its plot.  You cannot help it, but very soon you want to defend Claes and hope that he can vanquish his enemies and also you feel extremely happy when he is able to lift himself from being a simple servant to his present station.<br />The places, people, history, everything is masterfully detailed by the author.  If you love history, this book is just &quot;what the doctor ordered&quot;.<br />I hope everyone that reads this book enjoys it as I have done, and I am so looking forward to all the sequels.	2001-05-31

He succeeds not only in his trading, he saves his people from the Turks and also his step-daughter, Catherine.<br />Once again, the author has written a masterpiece.  We are thrown from Florence to the middle east with all its complexities, but all the time we are rooting for our hero and he makes us proud!<br />And to think I still have more books to enjoy!

This drug has an enormous effect on people and is being sought after not only by the DEA, but also by most Pharmaceutical companies.  Only Net Force has the capability to find the people behind it.<br />This is the typical plot by Tom Clancy, but always very entertaining.  There could be some extra technical information, but I am sure some tech buffs just love this!<br />The characters are real, interesting and interact well.  Places and situations are also interesting and the plot never gets bored.<br />Good reading.	2001-05-03

At the same time, it is the story of a woman who tries to learn about a virus that has affected some boys, but she is constantly attacked by the new laws that exist for this kind of investigation in the year 2007.<br />I really enjoyed reading this book.  The two stories have many similarities and are both very well written and very interesting.  The author describes very well the hardships of living in the middle ages as well as how it would be to live in a world where everything we do is controlled because of an outbreak on a very deadly virus.<br />The characters are very alive and well inserted into their specific contexts.  The places also seem very like-like, and even though the author must have speculated on both stories, they both seem very real, and are extremely interesting. <br />Both plots keep you interested until the end and you never are able to guess both outcomes.<br />Good read and well recommended.	2001-04-30

Her struggle to regain control of her life after a very difficult childhood and the death of her best friend.  <br />This is one of the first times I have read a book by Nora Roberts who also deals with mystery mixed with romance.  In this book it is a good mix.<br />The plot is very well thought out and the writing is interesting and real.  The characters are all very well described as well as the places.  <br />This is a great refreshing and very interesting book.  Well recommended.	2001-04-24

He faces incredible storms and temperatures to salvage a boat with passengers off the coast of Antartica.  He next saves an oil tanker who is also carrying his ex-wife and son.<br />As usual, Wilbur Smith writes in excesive detail, but makes every scene, every place and situation seems very real.  The characters are also very life-like and you warm up to them imediately.<br />If there was anything I could say against this book, it would be that the author seems to spend too much time describing every scene during the storms and salvages, when it is hard to follow because it gets very technical.  Also, the ending is a little disappointing because after he has warmed you up to his ex-wife and son you are left not knowing what happens to them.<br />However, it is overall a very good book and always a pleasure to read a book that is entertaining, alive and written in such a complete way.	2001-04-18

She decided to run away to Europe, where she becomes the au-pair for a well-to-do family in Paris with three children.  <br />Even though she tries to hide under the love of this family, she slowly realizes she is becoming a woman and has desires and feels the need to give her love.<br />It is not until she realizes that she has finally released her child and is ready to have her own life, that she wants to enjoy life on her own.<br />Even though this is the first book for this author, it is beatifully written.  Very slow and romantic and descriptive.  The characters are very alive and have genuine feeling, worries and joys.  They interact very well and make you live the life of a french family with all its peculiarities.  The settings are also very well chose, between Paris, the houseboat and Spain and the bullfighting.<br />One thing I did not fully understand is why the author gives us a chapter on each child, when clearly the focus of the story is between the two woman, Rosie the main character and Nicole the french mother.<br />But this is certainly worth the reading!	2001-04-05

All this upheavals also affect the Place of Truth.<br />The enemy of this sacred place tries to take advantage of the difficulties and destroy it but the protection of the goddess always wins.<br />This book is so full of wonderful descriptions, it makes you live and actually feel the people, the places, the serenity of the sacred valley.  <br />Once again the author brings to life the way people lived in those days and how profound was their beliefs in their gods and their influence in everyday life.<br />Wonderful book and a real joy to read.	2001-03-30

I have read many of his works and they are mostly related to the medical-investigative field and much more realistic.

Not only the character that was chosen by the author, but also the time period.<br />By choosing Georgian, Duchess of Devonshire, the author has capitalized not only on a very famous person in english history, but also on the family history with Diana, Princess of Wales.<br />You cannot help but make the &quot;rapprochements&quot; between the lives of these two women.  The Duchess, although she lived in a time where women where not allowed to enter politics, was successful in influencing politicians as well as the public.  She saw and understood the importance of appearances with the public.  The same happened with Diana, although she always fought the &quot;paparazzi&quot;, she always knew the power they had on the general public.<br />The author has written a brilliant biography.  She takes you through the subject's early life but during her adult life, she strives to make you understand the complexity of the Duchess.  On the one hand she was sensitive and intelligent, on the other hand she was an addict, be it to gambling or to love.<br />Very good book, and if you enjoy reading about history, you will enjoy this one in particular.	2001-02-08

US	50091197	R2GVF5LHR6ZM7	1583486232	688559795	Unlawful Deeds	Books	3	2	4	N	N	my review	Bruce Arrujo is a man on a mission: he has vowed that he will get a  million dollars, no matter the consequences.  Being a &quot;retired&quot;  thief, he has no qualms about changing his tactics now that he has become a  lawyer.  It is now only a matter of making it look  &quot;legal&quot;.<br />However, life has dealt him a totally different  hand...<br />I do agree the plot in this book is well thought out. However, it  is my opinion that the author gets lost into too much detail as to the law  and custom in Massachusetts concerning real estate.  Details that us  readers do not necessarily need.<br />If this book is supposed to be a  comparison between Brody and Grisham, one author gives too much detail of  the law, while the other not enough.	2000-09-12

Luckily the author has written a good summary of the two previous books, &quot;The first man in Rome&quot;, and &quot;The Grass Crown&quot;. So, it was possible to understand the events  leading to the beginning of this book.<br />I like the way the author presents  this book and the characters.  Being this a historical novel, I appreciate  the efforts the author has made to incorporate as much fact as possible  into the story.<br />The characters are very real and extremely  interesting.<br />The book, though it lacks a central plot, seems to be more  like an account of events and dates, but I really enjoyed this change in  &quot;content&quot;.  <br />I had already read &quot;Ceasar's women&quot; and  I enjoyed that one very much also.<br />I acknowledge Colleen McCollough as a  serious writer and I appreciate her quality and precision in her  narratives.<br />Great book!	2000-07-31

I'm not so sure.<br />However, there are certain inconsistencies in the book that do not make it seem real-life,  like having the lab in the basement and the neighbors not knowing.  We all  know how nosy neighbors can be....<br />As for the characters, the author  brings back a character he has used in previous novels. Jack, a doctor at  the New York City Medical Examiner's Office.  At least he keeps the  suspense going between the search for the poison and the relationship  between Jack and Laurie, a colleague.<br />It is an interesting book and it  will keep you reading.	2000-06-05

I found it very hard to be able  to follow everybody's comings and goings if there is no real central story  and no central character.  Of course the policeman, Tommy O'Connor if  interesting, but there is absolutely no relation to Laura (the single  mother) or to Alan, or even to his friend Rick because Tommy &quot;does not  want to be involved&quot;.<br />The writing is very good, and the descriptions  of characters and places are also very good, but without a real plot to the  book, it just feels as if you are reading a newspaper story.	2000-05-25

Even  though the story seems to be a little far fetched at times, it is very  entertaining.<br />What makes this story so special is the cadre it is set on:  the Gold Coast on Long Island, where mansions of an era gone by are the  testimony of a life we could not even imagine....	2000-05-25

Not only about the life of ancient Egypt, but also about how these ancient craftsmen viewed their talent and their work, associating it with life.<br />The story is about a  village in ancient Egypt where all the craftsmen working on the Valley of  the Kings must reside, away from the people.  They are thought as people  who have a special gift and they are responsible for making the transfer of  life for the Pharaohs, from their deaths to their next life, and are  therefore sworn to secrecy.  Of course, all this secrecy brings about  jealousy....<br />The story is well written and the author presents the  characters very well and you become familiar with these characters. He also  introduces us to all aspects of life in ancient Egypt. From the worker to  the magistrate to the mayor, back to the craftsmen; and how each one reacts  in their sphere of influence.<br />Great read.	2000-04-11

I had read the previous book by this author and I had found it a good read.<br />The story does not unfold immediately.  The characters are not well introduced  either.

At the end, the whole plot  finally comes around and the characters become totally familiar, and that  is when you appreciate the story who is actually well thought out.	2000-04-07

I like the way the author describes the characters, she always makes them so real, with real emotions and frustrations and feelings, be it  hate or love or simple ignorance.<br />Every single novel written by this  author, carries something very different from the previous.  In this case,  the author combines a southern girl who marries into a very affluent New  England family, and her struggles to feel included in it.<br />Great plot and  great description of places.	2000-03-20

They seem so real, it is hard to tell this is a work of fiction.<br />The author has masterfully recreated the life in the south from the 1950's, seen from the eyes of a  young boy, belonging to the &quot;old&quot; southern family.  He lives in  his house with a &quot;foster&quot; sister, who ends up influencing his  upbringing.<br />Good story, good characters, great places!	2000-03-20
US	50091197	R1EY2VQ24XA5I5	0061099686	99650789	Downtown	Books	4	5	6	N	N	my review	This is the first book I read from Anne Rivers Siddons.  I had just moved to Atlanta, and I had heard that this author also lived in Atlanta and that all her novels were based in the South.<br />I enjoyed reading this novel, not  only because I was familiar with most of the places described in the book,  but also because I liked very much the style the author uses to describe  the characters, their emotions.<br />Suffice to say, I was totally  &quot;hooked&quot; and I have read almost all of her books.	2000-03-20

Although the plot seems very predictable, it certainly teaches us the dangers of bioterrorism and how easily it can be made and dispersed.<br />I like the way the author uses his characters, he makes them seem very real. And, if you are familiar with Cook's books, it  certainly is a pleasure reading again about &quot;Jack&quot;, his main  'hero'.	2000-03-12

It has all the elements to make it a great read: the lawyer who tries to save his grandfather from an atrocious death, the family wishing to see the killer  of their sons finally put to death, and the people involved, wishing to use  this case for political advancement. Great book and great plot.	2000-03-06

Every time I pick it up, it feel like the first time!

Again, Michener has  given us a beautifully written book and a real joy to read.	2000-03-06
US	50091197	RI1GADJGY6EBR	0767900383	632913221	Under the Tuscan Sun: At Home in Italy	Books	4	4	4	N	N	my review	I like the way the author describes the process they go through for the restauration of their new home. You live through their anxieties regarding the installation of their floors, the opening of new doors, specially when  you are dealing with people who have no sense of rush, but prefer to take  their time and enjoy their work.  I also think she has a great gift in  depicting not only the people, but also the countryside, the history of the  region of Tuscany.  The way she talks of the markets, it makes you almost  smell the tomatoes, the basil, taste the pasta...! Reading this book has  not only made me a better cook... it has also made me look forward to  spring!	2000-03-03

The author has brought real-life meaning to a story told many times! Brilliantly written. I  enjoyed once again his hard facts and real characters.  Irving Stone  definitely is a master.	2000-02-28

His use of narratives to tell us the way Washington evolved from a third son to one of this nation's founders is extremely well done.  By using characters from all  aspects of Washington's life makes it all more real.  We read about the  man, the &quot;massa&quot;, the general and the husband.  Great Work.	2000-02-09

I am still very much impressed by the way her narrator, and main character make the book seem so real and so easy to read.  I have studied and read a lot about the  life of Henry VIII, but this is the first time I can feel as if I know him.  To add the notes from his fool, only makes the story more real and  believable. Being a great lover of historical novels, I can only say: Great  Work and please keep it up!	2000-02-09

I was able to enjoy a good historical novel, while at the same time learning a lot about real historical facts.

Once again, the way Margaret George uses Mary as the narrator of  her life is ingenious and makes the story all the more interesting and  real.  Very well written.	2000-02-09
