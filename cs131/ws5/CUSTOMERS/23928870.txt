Gathered from lectures from Aristotle's school known as the Lyceum, this book reproduces the way things were categorized and why  and is quite fascinating to read.  Most, when thinking of Aristotle, think about his works on Logic or Ethics, but he was also a zoologist, an astronomer, a geologist, a meteorologist, and also knew anatomy and physics.  Aristotle most likely knew everything there was to learn in his culture.  That makes this book especially interesting coming from that perspective.	2005-09-25
