With the first murder on page one to the last one in the next to lastchapter,  there was not a lot ofsuspense.  I could put the book down and pick it up 2 days later to read a couple more chapters.The most exciting part was when the baby was going to be born,  if indeed the expectant mother was not killed first.The most touching pary was the sheriff meeting his first born son by an Indian woman.  Finding this older son who was in law enforcement too,  and establishinga new family seemed to outshine the murder victims left over the country side with a sign Everyone Dies or Youu Are Next on the body or near it.If you are looking forward to exciting descriptions of New Mexico's beautiful colors.  look else where.There are other authors of this genre that provide far more exciting adventures.	2003-09-14

The twoagain try to make something outof a half-finished book of Wayne'sbut it isn't working.  Only a fewpages of The Hook remain so how isthis to end so soon.

Iliked the way Westlake writes with tongue in cheek and generally tothe point.  He gives insight intomoderen day publishing woes andhow the computer skims over thebooks to select the top writers,shuting down the market for thenew comers and mid-level writers. Here we have Wayne and Bryce meetin the library after a twenty yearlapse in contact.  Both are frustrated, Bryce by writer's block and Wayne unable to publish his finished book.  Bryce offersto \\"rewrite\\" Wayne's book underhis name and split the million +advance if Wayne will but get ridof Lucie, his money grabbing wife.The pact is made and Wayne meeteLucie for a date. In her apartmentto say good-night, Wayne suddenlyattacks Lucie and beats her to death. He collects his money, starts writing for magazines andforgets about the killing. Brycecan't stop imagining how it wasand goes into a depression.  Hisagent is pressing for evidence of his next book but Bryce can'twrite anything but gibberish. Heneeds Wayne to help him.  The twoagain try to make something outof a half-finished book of Wayne'sbut it isn't working.  Only a fewpages of The Hook remain so how isthis to end so soon. Just like aHitchcock story...unexpectedly andyou get to complete it youself.Those readers who wanted more charcter development need to realize that men like Wayne, a cold-blooded killer, and Bryce, amanic-depressive don't have theessentials to be developed unlessthey get proper therapy.

Double agents are not revealed until theend where most of the action takesplace. Dr. Lucas, Luke, wakes up in apublic rest room looking like a bum.  He has amnesa but his instincts tell him this is not howhe lives.  By deduction he figureshe is a professional person with agood education. Most of the firstpart is learning who he is.  Thenhe tries to determine why he wasgoing to Huntsville and WashingtonDC. when he should have been at the Cape preparing for the missile launching. The next part he spendstime with his old friend, trying to figure out who the double agents are and why he married his wife and why they don't have anychildren. Follett tries to putsuspense into all this but it lacks the sparkle so it becomesho-hum reading.He and his true love finally figure things out and swing intoaction to prevent the destructionof the missile.I had read this book before but did not remember it except certainparts seemed familiar.

Especiallyif you have to put it aside for aday or two.That's not hard to dobecause it is not a page turner.Several countries are scheming toclaim a new volcano before itcomes to the surface.  It must beoutside the 200 mile limit of Hawaii for another country toclaim it for themselves.  Riotsare staged in the Islands to keepAmerica distracted.  The need is to claim the volcano for miningrights to the new metal formed bya nuclear blast in the volcano.There are so many nationals fighting to be first that dead andmutilated bodies abound ad nauseam. An American geologist gets involved and naturally defeats all the evil men but onewho disappears but he's sure toturn up in a future book.  I thinkMr. DuBrul tried too hard to comeout of this as an equal to TomClancy on his first trip out of the gate.  A little less wouldmake a good story for his nextbook.

Told in the first-person, Julliet is almost a non-person.  I could not relate to her at all. Summed up: \\"I went, I saw, I became, I returned.\\"  Shades of high school Latin which was more interesting!  Read it if you must but borrow it.

I picked it up at the library by mistake and when I saw what it was about decided not to read it.  BUT curiosity got the better of me and I did ENJOY it very much.  As a kid I loved Flash Gorden but lost interest along the way. If you want good detail read the other reviewers who really understand the subject.  I enjoyed the idea of living under the surface of the moon, the fast commutes betweenearth and moon and the idea of mining the Asteroid Belt for energy sources,  That women were capable of piloting an exploratorytrip to the Belt (unauthorized ofcourse) had me thinking  &quot;Go Girl&quot;just to prove it could be done.Ben Bova provided an excellent adventure and I think just maybe I will deliberately bring home another one of his books. Do give it a try if you have been avoidingspace travel or colonazation but remember there is always the bad guy waiting for you.	2002-10-24

Her 9 yr. old daughter could be next so Kirsten agrees to enter the WITSEC program which she mistrusts from the beginning. They are in the new town wiih new identities for only a short time before her enemy finds them.  Another town, a different look and new names but again they are found. With no one to talk to or identify with, she is referred to a psychotherapist.  Things that could go wrong, do and Kirsten finally contacts an old friend.She discovers that two of her friends and co-workers think they sent the wrong person to death row and now want to prevent his death.  They suspect the young man was framed by a cop involved in the original case. With the death of her friends Kirsten begins to think it's not the drug lord after her but someone else.  The novel gives the reader a good idea of what it's like to be inside the Witsec program, not having close friends and not knowing whom to trust. It's no wonder Kirsten is beside herself trying to protect her daughter as well. There is a lot of action in the last part of the book to make up for the slow parts. This is my first read by this author but I see he has lots of fans. His next novel is \\"Warning Signs.\\" I don't know if I will become a fan or not.  In retrosect, I find this one more exciting than when I read it. Wading thru the psychologist visits were tiresome and in the end she was still not sure of her future.	2002-10-20

Baldacci usually writestoo long a story and has troublebringing them to a close.  Thatgives it a 3 1/2 star but it isBaldacci so I gave it a 4. The line \\"And so he did.\\" actually rates it a 3.

There are 2 chapters of that one at the end of&quot;The Surgeon&quot; in the Paper Back edition.By the title I thought this would be a medical mystery about a doctor's adventures.  The surgery involved is not the kind you want to think about, or have done. Thereading is so absorbing and realistic you may read it straightthru because you can't wait to seewhat happens next. I hope you have a companion in the house or at least a pet to keep you comforted.If I revealed some details, you would say, forget it, too unrealistic BUT you would be verywrong.

It ia a novel about churches, the people who attend or don't because of the differences in beliefs, or the hurts they have received from the \\"top guns\\" of the church...the ones in charge of everything and don't want new blood coming in with new ideas, upsetting the status quo.  I had to smile at the characters that I have seen in churches I have attended or heard about from others.  This small town had more churches per square mile than you find in most towns and truly reflected the problems that even the ministers, pastors or priests sometimes face. But that all changes when some people start seeing faces in the clouds, white robed men looking like Jesus and tears running down the face of Jesus on the crucifix hanging in the Catholic Church. Every one wants to be cured by the tears but why are some healed but not others? The town is swamped with pilgrims seeking the miracles. But the man who finally reveals himself to be the \\"real\\" Jesus is one of the false prophets who plans to take over the town for his personal use. Things start coming to a crisis as sides are taken to turn husband against wife, parent against child and friend against friend.  Chaos takes over and who is in charge of the situation is slow to resolve it.  The ending of the book is horrific and makes the reader stop to think about all that's been said about the end of the earth.  This is the first book I have read by Peretti but it won't be the last. Highly recommended for Christian readers who might find themselves among the pages.It is well written with well developed characters that keeps it interesting and suspenseful.	2002-09-27

REICHS is the author of 5 books but this is the first I've read.Tempe Brenner is a forensic anthropoligist which gives her a one up on a medical examiner. The author holds that title and writes accordingly.  So prepare yourself for a lot of morbid details as you read how Brenner conducts her investigation of the airliner that crashed in the mountains of North Carolina.  She conducts the examination of every body and body part that is collected from the crash area, which covers three ridges and valleys. If you have never thought about the injuies and mashed flesh to be recovered from the filth and stench of an airplane crash, you will find all the details layed out for you.When Brennen takes a walk to get away for an hour's respite, she finds herself surrounded by viscious animals carrying a foot from someone's leg. That may be the only piece to identify someone so she needs it. A former partner arrives in time to save her and the foot. DNA, x-rays, microscopic examinations are only some of the aides to help match up body parts with the list of passengers.But this is where the anthropology education comes in to play. Bone measurements can help identify the race of the foot's owner. Details and peoples names and ages and backgrounds go on endlessly as another source of body parts are found.  Another whole story opens up and one thinks the book will never end.  Thankfully it does but it leaves me wondering if I want to read any of REICHS' other books.  I won't for a long time.The parts I liked the best were the descriptions of the State and the flora of the Smokey Mountainsalong with the history of the people living there.	2002-09-21

His love of natural beauty comes throuh the characters' eyes.  You know the characters as he takes the time to develop them and still keep you in suspense, never boring you.  He doesn't blast you with a gorey scene on the first page.  Instead, he gently seduces you into the plots and climaxes, inticing you into the big climax when you realize you have come to the end of the story, breathless with the final action.

War at its worst is sometimes difficult to read about and trying to imagine the horrific details if you have never been exposed to blood and death is sometimes impossible. Knowing that our younger generations have had to fight in a war sometime, some place since 1776 doesn't make us non-veterans any more undrstanding. The author tries tomake you live the fighters' emotions by shocking you with more gory detail than you can assimilate thru his style of writing.  If you have read the book once, you have read it twice because you have to keep reading the page over once or twice to see who \\"he\\" is and whether it happened to Huebner(Gus), Bradley(James) or Gentle (William).  These men are real people set in the novel about the slaughter of the Native American tribes ordered by our government to clear the land of these \\"savages\\" so the white people could settle down in peace on the grounds soaked with the blood of both races. Mr. Huebner writes in an unusual way; with no quotation marks and a minimum of other punctuations, you become confused as to who said or did what. I forced my way thru to the final chapters where the author spent more time \\"bringing you down\\" from an emotional high by describing the beauty of the countryside. In this country's most costly mistake, the leaders refused to believe that \\"red\\" and white could co-exist. Beautiful cultures were destroyed by men with a vengence, especially after Custer's stupidity at the LittleBighorn. If any one peoples should be finacially awarded for their mistreatment, it should be the American Tribes whose land we sit on today. When you read this novel you will wonder \\"why didn't the soldier just give up and go home\\"instead of \\"just following orders.\\" This book will make you rethink our American rights. Too much gore and the writing style dropped my rating from 5 to 4 stars. There was a place called \\"Pennsyl-tucky\\" when West Virginia was part of Pennsylvania!	2002-08-05

This is the first book by Goudge that I have read; I went into it cold and did not read the reviews until I finished it. Not being an avid reader of romance books, it was a surprise to see that it was combined with my favorite genre: mystery-thriller. You can get the details from other reviewers if that is what you are looking for but I say, read it and judge it for yourself.  True, it may sound like a soap opera but aren't our lives the basis for those soaps?Every body has to make decisions that ultimately affect the lives of others and your decisions will have great impact that you never in your life could imagine. In this story, decisons made 4 generations ago lead to a terror-riden climax with a beautiful ending.  See if you can identify with the different characters in your own family's generations. I did and saw a lot of \\"what if\\"s as we all do.

You even get to enjoy the early snow storm we are sometimes treated to when the colored leaves are still on the trees. If you love mystery-thriller-bloody action books, then this is a must read collectrs dream. Buy it or borrow it but you will read it a second or third time! Promise!	2002-07-30

Lincoln Rhyme, Amelia Sachs and Thom are involved in yet another crime investigation that twists and turns to keep you on your toes right to the end. And don't try to out guess Rhyme because you will be wrong!  If you say you did and were right, then you should write one of your own books to prove yourself.This time, quad Rhyme is in North Carolina to have experimental surgery done on his spinal cord to gain some use of his body. His cohort , Amelia, for reasons of her own does not want the operation done. Thom. his personal aide is there to do his job for his impatient, nit picking, nasty and sarcastic employer, being his same efficient, enduring self. He alone seems to understand Rhyme's frustration with his physical and emotional difficulties.  But there is nothing wrong with Rhyme's brain and his powers of deductionas as he investigates crimes and points to the guilty ones for the law enforcers to arrest.  Having to depend on others to collect the evidence for him to evaluate is hard enough but here in the backwaters of NC swamplands   he feels like a fish out of water.He is used to NY City and all his sophisticated equipment and experts. But he agrees to help out the locals (20 miles from the hospital) while he waits for test results. Two women have been kidnapped by a strange 16 yr. old boy who also is accused of killing a man. Evidence points to the &quot;Insect Boy&quot; but he outwits his pursuers until he is caught. Amelia springs him from jail and goes with him to rescue his victims. Amelia believes he is innocent and frustrates Rhyme even more. In the end, almost everyone is fooled but not until several more people are killed.  And why are there so many luxury cars and homes in this area but hardly any children?  Rhyme has his work cut out for him and he is sorely taxed to solve this cliff hanger. It's another page turner you won't put down easily and at the endyou,too will say, &quot;WOW&quot;.  And you will also have learned some interesting facts about the insect world that will surprise you. Read this one for sure! And find out why the boy is considered &quot;strange&quot;.	2002-07-30

BUT, for some reason I took this off the library shelf and once I started I didn't want to put it down. A book within a book kept it twice as hot.Sure, you begin to catch on, or think you do but there's a new twist in the plots of the two books and you're at it again from a new angle. One writer can't please everybody, hence the negative reviews. The book is a mystery, romance, and sexy almost thrller book. The characters are the love or hate types but you will find yourself switching them around as the story reaches the final climax. Sex scenes are not for puritans but you learn a wheelchair is not a turn-off! Other reviewers go into more detail so read them if you want more before you read it.  I started reading it without any fore knowledge and I loved discovering it for myself.  I do hope you read it and love it as I did, And then read it all over again!

All attempts at reading  her other books failed by the 3rd chapter. This book is short but no brain-buster. Other reviewers tell of the story very well so I leave it to them for the good reviews.Sorry, but I can't appreciate her style of writing or the continuoussexual-obsession which is usually wierd. I hope she is not drawing on personal experiences as a basisfor her plots.Not much suspense and I had no trouble putting the book down to do something else.Borrow it from your library.	2002-06-24

He recounts each man's experiences whether there or family waiting at home.  After 25 pages it reads the same.  I don't mean to be crass but how much can you take about the street boundaries, the chain of command,the operation command sites all of which is repeated too many times.I had no trouble putting the book down to get away from it.  It was a must-read if you are a patriot or a sensitive, loyal American that holds firefighters next to God. Yes, they are heros and save lives and property and too many were killed in action. But I question the Fund for the widows and orphans.  It seems a bit over done when we compare it wirh the service men killed in action whose survivors do not receive funds for the rest of their lives. It has been a labor to read this book and I suggest you borrow it from your local library unless your man was enshrined in the pages. Sorry, but that's the way I feel.  A little more caution could have saved a lot of worker's lives.	2002-06-09

Why the author felt hersmoking was relevant I do not know.The assignment of Paul Brenner wasa mystery and remained so until thevery last chapters but the murders did not seem to be the focus of the novel. For the first time I enjoyedthe description of the country ofViet Nam and the people living there. Paul's feelings as he revisited the battle fields and went back in time to remember thebloody battles and reactions to awar 40 yrs. ago brought back theTV reporting and body counts everynight ad nauseum for the viewers.There was enough suspense in everychapter to hold my interest. If you  are interested in reading the travelng thru the cities. villagesand country side you won't be disappointed.  If you want a thriller, that is there too buttoned down as you realize the comfort the vets find in going backto the source of so much pain.  Iwished the book was longer ,too butPaul's assignment was finished. I wonder if DeMille can come up with a sequel to finish the story.  Ihope so.  This was the first book Iread by him.	2002-03-27

Egypt has been successful in building the plant but now they need the yellowcake. Israel also has a plant and is in dire need of the same raw material.The Russians are backing the Arabs  in this race so we have the agents from the Mossad, the KBG, and the Arabs and a double agent thrown in for an advantage to which nation? Ken Follett is a great writer of suspense and keeps you guessing thru the entire book as to who is going to steal and keep the stolen goods. Schoolmates from Oxford and one of their professors from ten years ago seek to favor one country over the other. We know the prof favors one country but who does his daughter favor? Who comes up with a reasonable way to transport thethousands of tons of yellowcake and who figures out a way to steal it from them? You won't want to put this book down until the end so plan on loosing some sleep. After you finish this book you may want to catch your breath before you start another of Follett's books, \\"Eye of the Needle\\" which is another suspensful spy story of WW II vintage. Both deserve more than a five star rating.	2002-03-02

I was also interested in what the content would be now that we are at war with the same country that we &quot;helped&quot; defeat Russia...was that aid a mistake?  While this is fiction it gives us a better idea about the geographic layout and the problems faced in a war fought on the enemy's home field. The main characters play out their altruistic games and the chase is on. But how many times can you falldown with a baby being handed back and forth while trying to escape the villains as you cross the highest mountain peaks to reach the next country?  The action is breath taking, to be sure, and any minute you expect a bullet in the back or a fatal drop off the narrow trail on the mountain side. Follett can keep you reading on from one close escape to the next but at times I found myself asking what are they doing that for, are they crazy? But you soon find an answer as the story takes yet another twist. I read for the suspense and action and do not try to out guess the author so I enjoyed the book As for the love scene, it was vivid enough the first time that I didn't have to reread it...this was a used book and the pages were not dog eared by previous readers either.  It was one of the most sensitive writings I have ever read, especially by a man. Some of the other male writersmight well learn from Follett's sensitivity towards women. Over all, this was an excellent reading.	2002-01-27

Dad asks the questions and CJ gives the answers as they crack up laughing and every one joins in on the fun. I thought it might be too advanced but these Bugs can be enjoyed by a  3 yr. old with a sense of humor. The lift tabs add to the fun and are strong enough to last with the sturdy book which is filled with  colorful and funny illustrations.  This is a book well worth its price and can be passed on down to the younger kids in the family if it is ever outgrown. But keep it in the family because their kids will enjoy it just like their dad and grandpa are now.  I highly recommend this as a gift for any  occasion as long as there is someone to share a sense of humor with them. 10 stars for Giggle Bugs	2001-09-02

She had to answer each phone call from anyone who wanted her service and I found that to be a little too much. Surgeons don't operate on such a hectic schedule or they would burn out in a month.  I would have liked to learn more about the interviews themselves...some lasted for days...but little is revealed about how she reached into the traumtized memory to elicit such a detailed drawing of the faces. Nor did she offer any ideas about how her talents could be taught to others although she maintained her   method should be learned in order to obtain accurate descriptions immediately after the criminal act. On the whole an interesting read but not a text book outlook for solving a crime quickly.	2001-06-17

The generation of Americans that fought for all Americans is fast disappearing.  Beore that happens books like Flags of our Fathers should be required reading for one of the high school history courses to educate the kids about the sacrifices made by 17-20 yr old boys in 1945.  I was16 at the time yet I did not understand how vital the battle of Iwo Jima was to the victory over Japan; of how determined the Niponese soldiers were to fight to the death for the glory of their emperor; how brave our boys were to face the onslaught of all the guns and bullets thrown at them even as they stepped off the landing ships thru the ocean water turned red by the Marines blood. No wonder the few survivors did not want to talk about the night mares they endured for years after returning home. This book along with other stories of WW II should be read by all of us in memory of each man and woman who answered their country's call to defend our lives and the way we chose to live it. Otherwise we might be speaking Japanese or German today.	2001-06-16

I heard some raunchy stories about Grover Cleveland when he held public office even before he became the city mayor. But my real interest in this book was the development of the power stations at the Falls and the locale of the events that took place in the city of Buffalo. I was a student nurse at Millard Fillmore Hospital in the late '40s and I enjoyed the memories of all the local streets...I lived in a small mansion that had been used as a student's residence and relived the memories I imagined taking place there. I knew Elbert Hubbard's grandson and several descendants of the high society families that were patients at the hospital. The Forest Lawn cemetey was a favorite place to visit to absorb history and gain some relief from the stress students developed. That whole area is alive and thriving today despite the rust belt reputation. I found the book to be alive with the characters portrayed and realistic in the views they held then as people do today. Buffalo has not learned the mistakes of the past and that is why we are repeating those same mistakes today. If those readers who thought the book was hardly worth reading could not find the vitality of the life and times and events of the era covered, they surely missed the boat! I think every one from Western New York should read and enjoy this novel	2001-04-25
