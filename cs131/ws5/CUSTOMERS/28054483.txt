Well, he sure didn't pick a good title. Religion, fundamentalist / evangelical / backward thought in particular IS the darkness. This fellow is the CEO of a religion channel. I cannot tell you how completely and totally bizarre an experience it is to watch mindless garbage like INSP or TBN. It is voyeurism. It is open display of mental sickness, distributed to thousands of viewers. It is uncomfortable to watch, yet, like a horrific scene of tragedy, you cannot turn away. The compulsion to see actual people regressing to a state of infantilist dependency on a \\"God\\" or his \\"son\\" cannot be denied. Unfortunately, there are too many people whose minds are so unquestioningly pliant, that this insanity and its mode of delivery is rendered \\"legitimate\\", all because it IS available to see. Religious programming IS the darkness, the trojan horse, seeking to infiltrate otherwise potentially healthy minds.	2005-10-04

Because they're so desperate for ratings, they've decided to ape Fox News. They have the drunk, psycho blowhard Nancy Disgrace. They have airheads like Robin Meade, who wears WAY TOO MUCH makeup and is as phony as the day is long (\\"Good Morning, Sunshine!\\" - she's talking to a REMOTE, UNMANNED TELEVISION CAMERA!) and Erica Hill (who wears her hair like as a stiff, UGLY helmet) who try and act like they're actually \\"there with you\\"; like they're your \\"friends\\". Very deceptive. To their credit, they did fire the bow-tied moron and Bill Hemmer. Thank God Judy Woodruff is gone (Hey, Larry King: FOLLOW HER LEAD!) They never should have hired Soledad O'Brien. It was a horrible mistake booting the sexy Paula Zahn from mornings. CNN and other 24 hr news channels are only at their best when providing live, unscripted coverage, where they don't have a chance to can their comments. Instead of providing REAL news, viewers are subjected to \\"human interest stories\\" like young blondes who go missing, exploiting them for all their worth. CNN is the equivalent of \\"reality\\" tv - which is to say: GARBAGE. If you want some real news visit Democracy Now - THAT'S worth watching.	2005-08-03

On the one hand, if she really IS giving voice to her deepest, most true emotions then I lay the blame upon her paymasters at Court TV and CNN. But let's be real - she knows what the deal is. She knows her audacious style lures people in. It makes you wonder how she performs, er, behaves when the cameras switch off. Even worse are her no-life viewers who call in, \\"Ohh, hiya Nantsi! Ohhh I just agree with evraything yew say! Are we friends, Nantsi?? Huh, ahr we????\\" Pathetic. This woman needs to get OFF of television and drag her miserable self into a sanitarium.

These savages who desecrate the so-called Christ and his teachings deserve to be sent to live under a brutal, callous, totalitarian society.

After that begins an auditory, visual and olfactory assault upon the senses. The stink of fast food wafts throughout. Filthy, dirty floors being trod upon by barefoot parents and their screaming, woebegone rats, uh, I mean children. Cheap, imported sweatshop merchandise scattered EVERYWHERE. In order to create some semblance of dignity for their employees, they are called \\"associates\\" (oooh, like a law firm! when can I start!). Their television ads are godawful, always trying to look like a hip place to shop - which they will NEVER be. I do not mean entirely to mock those who shop there. In fact these scum merchants may be what allows them to survive day to day. It is a vicious cycle. It is known that Wal-Mart is virulently anti-union, antagonistic toward any effort toward collective bargaining for its workers. The stories of communities fighting to keep this exploitative, parasitic corporation out are legion throughout America. Avoid shopping them at all costs.	2005-01-03

Imagine grown adults adamantly believing that Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny truly existing. What? You never see them? You must not have any faith!    It is deplorable and disheartening to learn of this book's availability at NPS / Grand Canyon bookstores.    The evangelical / born-again / fundamentalist is a real threat to today's cultured, civilized society. Claptrap as this is meant to be an innocous offering, but make no mistake - it is part of an agenda to move American society away from intelligence, peace, and stability toward their ultimate goal: the nuclear annihilation of our world in sick hopes of triggering the return of \\"Jesus Christ\\" and the fairy-tale \\"Rapture\\".

I admit, NOTHING has ever aroused me like some of the entries inside - even hardcore [...]. It's all about intent, motive, desire. Is it real? Is it sincere? You could put the most flat out gorgeous woman in front of me and she might not have anywhere near the erotic intensity of a woman who society might deem \\"less than perfect\\" looks-wise. It almost always is the look in her eye, or the pitch of her voice, something that conveys warmth, you know?
