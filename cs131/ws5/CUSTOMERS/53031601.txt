Then I picked it up in the library and just started to read and I was hooked.  I must admit I was pulled in and became very interested in the characters.  It becomes what I would call a \\"dreamy realism\\".  It is a book, however, that I think needs to be read in one setting (if possible)and certainly not spread out over a period of time as I think it would be difficult to get back into the story.  Overall, I was much more impressed than I expected to be.  Try it -- you might like it.	2005-09-29

The highly improbable story of the effect of a piano in the jungle became very believable as the scenes from Burma became very clear in my mind.  I was surprised at some of the negative reviews as I found the story fascinating -- remember it is a story. <br /> <br />There was a bit too much emphasis on the piano tuning details which I felt could have been eliminated, but just skim this and let yourself be drawn into a world we seldom see.	2005-09-26

The story reads smoothly and quickly and the characters are pretty believable, especially Nicky who at times seems a child and at other times, a young woman.  A few incidents in the story are a bit of a stretch and I felt the ending week; however, good story, quick read, and great for light reading.	2005-09-19
US	53031601	R1WTB0OV463DC8	0060515104	394934294	The Painted Drum: A Novel	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Story blends modern angst with tribal lore	The opening chapters center on Faye Travers, a modern woman whose grandmother was Ojibwe, and who with her mother Elsie owns an estate sale business.  Faye is hired by the family of a former Indian agent whose estate is filled with Indian artifacts including a decorated drum which Faye uncharacteristically steals. Eventually Faye and Elsie decide to return the drum to a family of Ojibwe who Elsie remembers.   <br /> <br />The real story then begins to unfold.  The drum has touched several generations of Ojibwe since its creation by Bernard's grandfather who made it out of sorrow for the loss of his wife who left him for another man and the resulting death of his daughter.  The story doesn't follow a straight line but wanders through the lives of the unfaithful wife, the older son, and most poignantly, the lives of three small children left by their mother in the cold and without food.   <br /> <br />Erdrich's writing is not always easy to read; the convoluted story line of the drum is at times difficult to follow because Erdrich is mostly telling it backwards.  The drum's effect on the lives of the characters is sometimes a bit of a stretch as Indian lore and beliefs intertwine with the realities of life. The book is the sharpest and most effective during the story of Shawnee, the nine-year old girl who walks her younger sister and brother to safety following a tragic house fire.  The book is the least effective during the portions dealing with Faye and her relationship to a lover and her own feelings of inadequacy and guilt.  I wish Erdich would concentrate more on stories and characters and less on what I call the \\"abstract.\\"   In short, Erdich is a great story teller and a master at phrasing.  It's when she gets into the first-person narrative with rambling thoughts that she sometimes loses me and there is a bit too much of that - therefore a four, but still certainly well worth the effort it takes to read. <br />	2005-09-16

Someone reviewing that book recommended this one and indeed it provides yet another look at the same problems.  This book was written in 1979 and portrays post-colonial Africa; Caputo's book written in 2005 shows that situation has only gotten worse. <br /> <br />I had to force myself to finish this book, but when I did, I was glad.   It was as if it didn't quite come together until the end.  The ending was so visual, dramatic and well-written, it made the effort of reading worthwhile.   <br /> <br />I agree with many reviewers that they are some events that are just difficult to figure out.  Salim's beating of Yvette is one case in point; I just didn't get it. <br /> <br />I know Naipaul is an excellent writer and one that I will explore more of; however, he isn't easy. <br /> <br />	2005-08-31

I have no background in the culture, environment, or political situation of the Sudan; yet, I feel I have in some sense been there.  Caputo provides a multi-layered picture of the people and places of this war-torn country.  My mind's eye could easily envision the land and people; I could almost taste and smell the dust and sweat and had clear mental images of the major characters.  The political situation is nothing short of a mess:  \\"In Sudan the choice is never between the right thing and the wrong thing but between what is necessary and what isn't\\"    I found the characters, however, to be closer to symbols for the many factions working in Africa than real people.  The dialogue was particularly distracting in places; it just didn't ring true.  Nevertheless, these characters well depicted the forces at work -- the American do-gooder, the war lord, the cynic, the evangelist, the rebel leader, the old-rich, the new-rich, and the victim.      One review suggested that Caputo could better tell the story as non-fiction.  He is certainly knowledgeable, and after doing a bit of research, the situation in the Sudan seems accurately presented.  His strength is not in writing dialogue that is true; however, I would never have read this book if it wasn't presented as a novel.  The relationships developed by the characters keep a reader's interest while providing a sound picture of the Sudan.      I loved the title of the book and if there is one thing I will definitely take from the book, it is the illustration of the conviction and fervor of those who were certain they were right -- so certain that the consequences never matter.  At the same time, there are those who were never sure of the decisions they had to make, yet they acted.  Both could be said to be carrying out acts of faith.  Some because they were sure and others because there is simply nothing else to do.	2005-08-15

This book brought back many memories of growing up in the 1950's.

The \\"fast forward\\" to Madeline as an adult tied everything together so well. Great read -- just be prepared to devote many hours to reading and not getting anything else done because the book is long and one you won't want to put down.	2005-07-12

The characters of Concord such as Thoreau and Emerson and March's wife, Marmee, provided an interesting look at the passion of the abolitionists.  Marmee's reaction to the freed Blacks in Washington DC and especially her impression of Grace prove that it is much easier to love an idea rather than people.  Mr. March is a weak character, but it's a rare individual who can always do the right thing when trapped in time of war with all its fear and suffering. <br /> <br />A reader certainly doesn't have to be a fan or, or have even read Little Women.

I've read quite a few historical novels set in Ireland from the Tuatha De Danann to the Easter Rebellion and nothing put it all together as well as this.  And in such a light and interesting way.  Reading this book is like examining the facets which make up a beautiful diamond -- you see little minute parts of a history that gradually comes together in a wonderful story.  For example, I've read complete novels about the potato famine. The 3 or 4 page story of the  the doctor's anquish examing the potato leaves left me with a clearer feeling of the terror of famine than many complete books have done.   <br /> <br />At first I wasn't sure I was going to like the chapters alternating between \\"plot\\" and \\"story\\" but it didn't take too long to begin to see the connection and then I was totally pulled in and found it hard to put the book down.  This book is a delight.	2005-06-16

On any day we can be fearful of the world's future; we can be content in a loving yet sometimes touchy family relationships; we can be comfortable in careers, and we can be forced to react to situations that seem unfair, random, or meaningless.  As different as Henry's world is to mine, I could relate.  I suppose that's a sign of a good author. <br /> <br />On the other hand, I can't say that \\"Saturday\\" will be a novel I'll never forget.  The situations and Henry's reaction to them are at times just too contrived.  I really can't envision a street thug such as Baxter so easily softened by the recitation of a poem.  I can't believe a neurosurgeon would allow himself to perform surgery after the events of his day on that particular patient.  I can't believe the almost surgerical analysis of Theo's blues \\"three times rounds the twelve bars\\" and such could have such an emotional effect.  Henry seems to be an expert at many things (cooking, wine, music, squash), and totally oblivious to others.  The family is a bit too perfect, too artificial. <br /> <br />Furthermore, I don't understand  this novel as a reaction to 9/11.  Terror and fear of a world out of control is not new (remember the atom bomb).   <br /> <br />The writing at times is beautiful although at times tedious (that squash game!).  However, in spite of shortcomings, I'm glad I read \\"Saturday\\" and would recommend it to others for its ability to connect each of us in some very vague and almost unexplanable way. <br /> <br />	2005-05-21

Heaven Lake really does touch on so many subjects.  The travel in China was so interesting and so well depicted that I could easily see, hear, and smell the surroundings.  The portrayal of the Chinese I found to be respectful yet not sugarcoated.  The characters truly became people I felt I knew.    Vincent's transition from an overzealous Christian volunteer to one who fully learned to realize (if not understand) God's grace is not an easy one; he has no epiphanies; he just slowly grew into another person.  In the middle of the book (page 304 -thanks to the Amazon search feature), the author so clearly and succintly summarizes Vincent's growth, his realization, that \\"you could navigate your life without knowing. Even more, you could occasionally be awed by the mystery. You could sometimes love the mystery as devoutly as the believers loved their gods.\\"    The book is certainly not short on plot either.  The twists and surprises easily keep the reader interested.  Overall, this book is certainly worth a read.  Anxious to read more from this author.	2005-04-28

I loved Paradise Alley and Dreamland, so this seemed to fall in place especially after reading some of the editorial reviews.  However, it's not Paradise Alley or Dreamland.   <br /> <br />I really had difficulty buying into the idea of a gang communicating through singing, humming, or whatever they called it.  The scene in which the Whyos and WhyNots \\"began their work, each one trasmitting his or her message to a specific jury member via signals that were barely audible, barely even distinguishable from their breath\\" was just too much to believe.  And then when the heroine Beatrice begins \\"transmitting so subtly that none of them even realized she was doing it\\" I began to wonder if I was reading science fiction. <br /> <br />The dirt, smells, and sounds of old NYC seem to have been deeply researched:  Barnum's entertainment, the city sewers, the building of the Brooklyn Bridge, the early gangs.  I don't understand why then the author created such unbelieveable characters and circumstances.  Beatrice's escape from the gang, Harris' miraculous fall from the bridge, the inheritance from Mr. Noe are all just too contrived for really good historical fiction.	2005-04-20

Hijuelos is a master of description; the scents, sounds, and scenes are as vivid as any I have read.  The portrayal of a simple man, Cesar, shows how complex we all really are. <br /> <br />However, I must say after the second reading, I was somewhat turned off by the sex and I didn't like Cesar nearly as well.

The main character is not someone to like even though he is a young boy, but as a teacher I know there are lots of unlikeable children.  And I know that sometimes these unlikeable children grew up to be very respectable adults.  I thought the author did an excellent job of portraying the maturing of Amir.  Life handed him some very difficult curves; sometimes he responded honorably, sometimes not.   <br /> <br />I know nothing about Afgan culture other than what I read in the papers so I was a bit confused about the Hazara.  After a quick Google search, I had a better background for that and that added to the understanding of the book.   <br /> <br />I found the book to be interesting, fairly easy to read, and truly thought provoking.  It would be wonderful to think that we would all respond differently to the cruelties the characters faced, but we probably wouldn't.  Hassan's loyality is hard for us to understand, but again, I have absolutely no point of reference to living as second class citizen in a culture such as that portrayed in the book. <br /> <br />My only concern is that there was a bit too much coincidence, especially with Sohrab and the slingshot.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the human condition.

I'm not sorry I did.  It is interesting and thought provoking and provides a unique view of the world known to those living in that time and place. <br /> <br />I agree somewhat that the author's writing style was difficult at times and several times I had to reread sentences.  Also, the huge number of characters is confusing especially if one is not able to read the book in a short time period.  There is a list of characters in the back which I did use as a reference several times.  However, the theme, the characters, and the description of the setting far outweigh these \\"annoyances.\\" <br /> <br />I liked Jones' way to hinting what would happen to the characters later and I, like another reviewer, liked the chapter headings and I felt the title was so appropriate.  <br /> <br />In short, an interesting book which portrays another view of slavery and its effect on the slaves and the owners.  Those of us in the current century can be quick to judge those people that lived in that time, but we must remember that Manchester County was the only world known to the characters.  For those readers that want another perspective of our country's history, I would suggest this book.	2005-01-15

Although the oldest sister is the focal point of the story, the reader really gets to know the entire family -- each girl with her strengths, weaknesses, dreams, disappointments, and triumphs, and then there is Emilio surrounded by all those women in his life.    The writing is so readable; the words just seem to \\"paint\\" a picture of this remarkable yet so ordinary family.   <br /> <br />The book covers time from the turn of the century into the 1970's from Cuba, Ireland, and the US.  The plot is an ongoing saga with no great twists and turns although as in real life, surprises do occur. The culture of US and Cuba is a realistic backdrop.   Overall, great story about a great family -- but one not much different than any families we might know (of course, 15 children is a bit rare today).  <br /> <br />The writing in this book just pulls you in; it's not a \\"page turner\\" of excitment.

Incidents in the story take place in rural Iowa and Kansas from the time of the Civil War through the 1950's.  Although that time and culture is much different than most of us are now living, the characters of Rev. John Ames, his father, his grandfather, and his namesake John Ames Broughton are some of the most authentic that I have ever met in fiction.   <br /> <br />Gilead is a spiritually fulfilling book and not because (or maybe in spite of the fact) most of the major characters are preachers.  The fact that they are preachers only provides a clearer lens in which to see the issues of belief and doubt and how that belief or doubt affects our daily lives.  Interesting note that one reviewer who states he is an atheist wrote the book \\"becomes a meditation on how even the simplest life can be touched by grace and wonder.\\"  Perhaps it is the simplest life that is most likely touched by grace and wonder as these characters demonstrate so beautifully in many ways such as Rev. Ames' final blessing of John Ames Broughton and the heartrending scene of the young neglected mother and her naked unnamed child playing in the stream. <br /> <br />I can't decide if this is a simple book or a complicated one, but it is one that could and should be read over and over. It is  a significant book; however, do not think that it is \\"heavy.\\" There is a quiet humor that often surfaces in the least expected places.  I only hope that those with a cynical nature do not give up on it during the first part; it takes a while to work through some of the early narrative and what some might consider religious rambling but which provide the context for the confrontations that take place in the last third of the book.   <br /> <br />In short, a beautiful book by an outstanding writer. <br />	2004-12-03

The background of the book seems very accurate and well researched and consistent with other books of this time period.  However, the narrator Hannah Green just does not seem believable.

I had never even heard of Freya Stark before stumbling upon a recommendation for this book.  I started it with some uncertainty, but soon I couldn't put it down.  The author has done a wonderful job of presenting the life of this fascinating woman in the context of the times.  I learned so much about the history of the Middle East and have a little bit better understanding of the many complexities facing that area today.   <br /> <br />I loved the writing syle, the pictures, and the use of quotes from Stark's writing as chapter headers (several I have copied to keep on file).  This book is definitely readable, informative, entertaining, and has lead me to explore Stark's own writings as well as information about the many individuals who appear in the book (such as Gertrude Bell).   <br /> <br />The only annoying element of this book was the author's focus on Stark's appearance.  Apparently, however,  this was a huge concern for Stark herself, but by looking at her pictures, she certainly was not that unattractive.  And her smile is delightful. <br /> <br />I thank the Amazon reader who lead me to this book.  I highly recommend it as well. <br /> <br />	2004-09-13

The four sons are then scattered after they think their father has drowned while attempting to cross the Shannon River.  The story of each son is remarkable in that each finds himself following a separate road yet never forgetting the others in the family.  The father's search for the boys seems to provide a sense of magnetism which draws them all to seek each other.   <br /> <br />Each son has a different story and all are followed to one extent or another throughout the book.  Although the story of Teige, the youngest son, takes most of the story, the life of Finbar who follows the gypsies is especially well told.  The author takes the reader from Ireland across Europe and across the Atlantic to the wide west of America.  The potato famine, immigration to America, and the exploration of the West all provide backgrounds for the telling of the Foley boys' stories. <br /> <br />As I read this book, I couldn't help but think of my own ancestors as they traveled from Europe, some to the US and some to New Zealand.  Although not Irish, I'm sure each family member left home with his or her own set of troubles and hopes. sometimes conscious decisions were made and other times they were just swept along by circumstances. The road has not been straight as so well described by the Foley family.  Highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever wondered about how their own family has fit into the history of the time.	2004-09-06

I thought the author did an excellent job of providing three points of view from the three major faiths that each claim Abraham.  More importantly, he provided an insight to the factthat Abraham is a different person to each of the faiths, or that he is a composite of many individuals, or questions if he actually existed at all.  The end notes, questions, and readings provided at the end were helpful.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star was a note of flippancy that I detected some time.  Spending paragraph space on why Hollywood hasn't depicted Abraham, referring to the average individual as \\"joe sixpack\\", and some what I would call \\"cute\\" phrasing seemed to take away from the significance of the book.  This is definitely not a reference for someone working on a doctorate in theology, but it does provide a good overview for those of us who just want to \\"get an idea\\" of who Abraham was and the often conflicting views of his story.<br /><br />Lastly, the appeal for understanding between the faiths is commendable, but it seems to provide a feel of \\"grasping at straws.\\"  Sadly, however, that may be about all we have to even begin to bring an end to the huge chasm between the three faiths.	2004-08-30

However, life under Wahabi Islam defies that statement. We would love to think that every parent loves their chidren and would want to protect them; we would like to think that families could play and laugh together; we would love to think that eveyone wants a life of peace. The family structure under the Islamic fundamentalists is totally removed from anything that we think as normal. This is more than just &quot;cultural differences&quot; -- this portrays basic differences in how we view ourselves, other humans, and God. It will be a long time, if ever, that western culture and the Middle East can agree on anything.      The author is brave indeed to have written this book, but in light of her infamous name and the future of her children, I respect her for taking this approach instead of attempting to change her name and hide. This is an interesting book and certainly shows us that the world is definitely a dangerous place.	2004-08-04

This is not a book for those looking to discredit Bible translation as a way to discredit Christian faith. Obviously, the author has a great deal of respect for those that took on this task. However, he doesn't shrink from telling all the &quot;dirty laundry&quot; associated with the translation and the acceptance of the KJV. If we think politics and religion get all mixed up today, we only have to read this to find that there is nothing new in the world.  <br />  <br /> All in all, I found this book interesting, easy to read (except for a few places), and enlightening.	2004-08-01

I almost didn't finish this book because of the difficult sentence structure and just plain hard to understand writing at times. Now that I have read some of the other reviews, I have a better understanding of what the author was attempting to accomplish; however, for me the book would have had an even greater impact if I didn't have to &quot;work so hard&quot; to understand the language.  <br />  <br /> However, in spite of that, this is a wonderful book and certainly it is an enormous undertaking to try to show the struggle between science and faith in such an interesting way. This struggle is brought to life not in a huge clash of differences, but rather through the small, subtle events and actions over a life time. When Covington began his work for Darwin, he had no idea of what he was doing and where it would take him. His struggle of faith evolves in a complexities of his own life -- his relationship with the other seamen, his family, his work, his deafness, and his sense of pride and hurt ego at not being fully acknowledged for his contributions.  <br />  <br /> This book was hard to read, but when I was finished, I found myself going back and rereading sections that made much more sense the second time through. This is an interesting book, but one that would have had an even greater impact on me if the language would have been simplier. Sometimes the words just got in the way.	2004-07-30

This is a really good story for anyone who likes medieval fiction taken from historical fact.  As a lover of historical fiction, usually the medieval stories are pretty grim.  Although this certainly has its horrific events, the story is told through the words of a &quot;fool&quot; which makes the word play and the observations witty and insightful.  The character of the dwarf, Scarlet, will always be one of my favorites.  If you like the middle ages and mystery with a dash of humor, this is it.	2004-07-11

The priests, nuns, slaves, soldiers, and Indians of many tribes all play a part in this closely intertwined plot which involves land ownership, the church and its power, the Indian fight for survival, and a love story.  My only complaint might be that the many Indian tribes became confusing and some of the battle scenes became difficult to follow.  The plot really does depend on minute details -- sometimes almost too many to remember especially if the book is read over a period of time (just didn't have the time to read -- it really is a page turner most of the time).  Overall, I felt this was a better book than City of Dreams -- more realistic, yet interesting characters.  Shadowbrook paints a picture of a time when our country was being formed with all the good people, the bad people, and the many in between who were caught in circumstances beyond their control and were looking at the world in the only way they knew.  Overall, a good historical read.	2004-06-18

There is none of the mystery, darkness, or passion that one would expect in a fictional look of Poe and his wife and supposed lover. The author takes a very detached view of Poe and those around him; I was never really able to &quot;connect&quot; with any of the characters especially the many and confusing editors, magazine publishers, other writers, and business partners of Poe.  The book is a good &quot;overview&quot; of the world of publishing in New York during the middle 1800's and Poe's place or lack of place in it.  Another strange note: Poe's poem &quot;The Raven&quot; is a focus of the book and seems to be Poe's only real claim to fame during his life time; it is referred to many times.  In the back of the book a section entitled &quot;The Poems&quot; contains many of the poems written by Poe, Fanny Osgood, and others in the story.  &quot;The Raven&quot;, however, is missing.  It seems that would have definitely been included.  That lack seems to sum up the overall feeling I got from this book -- the peripheral is there, but the core is missing.	2004-06-05

The author provided a wonderful insightful look at new immigrants to this country and the tug between generations pulling it together with the conflict Gogol has with his name.  I know very little about the East Indian culture, but I do know something about how sons and daughters can look at the world in an entirely different light than parents.  The lack of understanding and the lack of communication between the parents and Gogal is not specific to East Indians; it is universal.

This book provides a brief look into the culture and times of Chicago and gives a chilling account of the actions of the serial killer.  I loved the insertion of the famous as Buffalo Bill and others who are sprinkled throughout.  The story is interesting but never quite comes together as I thought that it would.

Even Nico as he evolved into Asha became a fascinating character and a great look at what becomes of individuals who are torn from their culture and injected into another one especially when they are young.  The character of Christien Luc de Vries was especially interesting.  His struggles with the expectations of his father, his fascinationg with surgery, and his place among the Knights of Malta make for interesting internal conflicts.  And of course, the juxtaposition of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism on one small island gives a great background for the struggles we are still facing.  Overall, a great read.	2004-02-11

Bringing the German printing press to Venice provides a great backbone for the plot; however, the switching back and forth to the ancient poet and the sexual escapades of some woman named Clodia is just confusing. I guess the author wanted us to become as enthralled with the erotic poems as the Venetians were; however, for me it just didn't work. The details of the city, the differences in personality between the Venetians and the German printer, the superstitions, and the effect of the printing press are wonderful.  In all, very good historical read, but one that I almost abandoned due to excesses -- in wording and in characters.  (Sometimes I had to stop to read a sentence over and ask myself \\"what in the world did that mean?\\").   The character of Sosia is as one editor described \\"over the top\\" while other characters such as von Speyer are easily believable.	2004-01-14

Sometimes I felt like I was reading a spoof instead of a real mystery novel. After reading some of the other reviewers who loved this, I'm beginning to feel like I should go back and reread this.  In short, this is not a &quot;light&quot; read - one has to stay with it and concentrate; then it certainly could be worth while.

Once I got past the premise, I really enjoyed reading about the life of May Dodd who seemed to become more and more real.  The descriptions of life in the  tepee, the smells of daily living, the horrible violence of the frontier all become very real.  No one is a clear cut &quot;bad guy&quot; (except perhaps for the strange half-breed Jules ? , and even the most noble savage has a frightening side.

A Jefferson impersonator, the multiple-birth of 11 babies, a cynical high school teacher, a female dairy farmer, and an Episcopal priest all make for interesting characters; however, the circumstances they find themselves in are a stretch for the reader to believe.  And the making of a mammoth cheese to present to the president of the U.S. just didn't do much for me -- in fact, the whole presidential election bit was a bit weak in my opinion.  In short, it's entertaining and thought-provoking in places, but overall rather unbelievable.	2003-09-04

I'm a reader of historical fiction - thus I discovered Rose Tremain through Music &amp; Silence (Excellent) and Restoration (wonderful read).  I purchased this book simply because of the author.  When I got it and read the covers, I thought &quot;I've been gipped, this isn't what I wanted&quot; - However, after just a few pages, I was pulled in.  Mary/Martin's struggle with gender reflects every individual's struggle to become who they think they are meant to be. Gender identity is only a tool here; it is not the focus of the book. The English farm, the repressed family, the country music scene in Nashville  are a perfect backdrop for the inner struggles of characters such as Mary and Walter.  The author paints such a realistic picture: Struggles are hard and probably never ending.  The book also demonstrates the importance of the &quot;one person&quot; in someone's life who can make such a difference -- in small and often unknowing ways.  I can't say I loved this book, but I can say that I am so glad I read it.  The world is filled with Marys and Walters, and there is a bit of them in each of us as well.  The perspective this book brings is right on target.  Rose Tremain is truly a great writer.	2003-08-21

I'm not familiar with the history behind the story, but good historical fiction will put it all in perspective - this didn't.  I did not like the first person narrator; at times the writing seemed very simplistic and just &quot;too direct&quot; as if the writer was telling me exactly what I was to be feeling.

King Christian IV of Denmark is an absolute ruler who commands his orchestra to play from the cellar, yet he is almost a slave to his Consort, Kirsten, who has to be one of the most selfish, petty, vulgar, yet humorous characters I have ever met in fiction.  And one who I actually felt pity for at the end.  Peter Claire, the talented and decent lutest for the King, holds the story together yet is not the focus.  Emilia, Kristen's \\"general lady\\" truly has a good heart.  Her stepmother, Magadelena, a big, baudy peasant woman has a sexual appetite that includes her stepsons.  George Middleton, Peter's future brother-in-law is an overweight successful gentleman who is genuinely in love with Charlotte, a young nave innocent who is lives a charmed life surrounded by people who love her.  Sophie, the Dowager Queen, and Ellen Marsvin, Kirsten's mother, are survivors saved by cynicism.  No one is perfect, no one is totally evil (well maybe Kirsten), no one totally wins and no one totally loses.  The short chapters told from different viewpoints give a quality of different instruments playing in the orchestra, some are direct and bold while others merely provide the background.  I particularly looked forward to reading Kristen's version \\"From her private papers.\\"  Besides great characters, Tremain does an excellent job of painting the cold and dampness of Denmark.  Although a different time and place, a different writing style, and different characters, if you enjoyed \\"Crimson Petal and White\\" you will certainly enjoy \\"Music and Silence\\" - even more so.	2003-07-15

Even her mother-in-law Lillian, who at first meeting appears to be weak and self-centered learns to adapt to the hard circumstances of their life.  Joseph is a complex, distant, and distrusting man filled with a guilt that he himself does not seem to understand.  The setting of New Zealand with its rugged terrain seems to almost become a character.  All of the realistic and harsh aspects of this novel pulled me into the story.  However, the mysterious &quot;spiritual&quot; world of the Maori nurse and her relationship to young Edwin seems out of place in the story.  I was disappointed in this aspect of the book.  The contrast between how the Maori reacted to the environment around them and how the English settlers reacted could have better developed.  Overall, a really good historical fiction read	2003-07-07

This is basically a survival story.  Yonah learns to survive physically, mentally, and spiritually against huge odds.  At times, I felt he was a bit \\"over the top\\" with his ability to adapt so easily and become a master metalsmith and then a physician, but undoubtedly, there are individuals who do succeed in many diverse areas.  Yonah was smart and talented.  Equally important, his family background provided him with a sense, not of entitlement, but one of obligation to do his best, taking care of himself and those around him.  As interesting as he is as a main character, the individuals around him are also remarkable in that they are so human and are formed and reformed by the circumstances they find themselves in.  <br />Overall, this is a good read.

At times it is thought provoking; at other times, it is reads like a junior high adventure story, but it always makes the reader go on to just one more chapter.  The mixture of art, religious symbolism, paganism, and secret societies is fascinating.  Although to some, this may appear as anti-Catholic, I didn't find it so, but felt that a respect for real faith in a loving God came through.  The situations are bizarre and contrived, but this truly fictional book caused me to think about how much we don't understand, and that the road to how we got to where we are as modern day \\"religious\\" people has never been straight.  This book made me shake my head and smile and think of Shakespeare's line:  \\"Lord, what fools these mortals be [and have been]\\"  Read it for what it's worth, nothing more, but if you want a real page-turner with some interesting historical minutiae, do read it.	2003-04-01

I picked this book up because of the cover and almost didn't read it because of past experience with the author.  I'm so glad I let that face on the cover draw me in.  The characters in &quot;Master Butcher&quot; are real people who are products of the land, environment, and times in which they live.  Their lives are hard, but yet are sometimes filled with humor and song.  Their thoughts and feelings are repressed but not depressed.  The book is not &quot;pretty&quot; yet it is not &quot;ugly.&quot;  In our neat, clean, government inspected lives, we are so far removed from the act of butchering that it seems dark and violent, but to Fidelis and those around him, it is merely a fact of life -- an occupation and a good one at that.  Fidelis is a butcher who sings.  <br />Erdrich does a great job of weaving humor, fear, anxiety, and love into characters and events that are never contrived but are straightforward and almost passionless.  I'm definitely going to explore more of Erdrich's works.	2003-03-03

Almost as much as reading the book, I have enjoyed reading the reviews of this book especially from those who can relate so well.  While the details were just overwhelming in places for me, they were the essence of the novel for others.  There truly is a different way of viewing the world from the East and from the West.  This book has helped me understand a bit more.     And although it was an insight into the modern Eastern woman's world, it was also so universal in theme.  I could see so much of my husband of 30+ years in Saif.  Maybe men are men whether they are from the mid-west or from the Middle East.      I would love to read more of Soueif's works (I did read Map of Love -- and thought it was wonderful) especially in light of what is happening in the Mid East today; the change in culture from the time Asya left Egypt to the time she returned was interesting to me.  I want to know how a character like Asya is doing now in Egypt.

Edward Ives is not perfect and his struggle to find God is not dramatic - it takes his entire lifetime, but a simple faith sustains him.

The character of Israel Levis is so real and &quot;historical&quot; that I found it almost impossible to believe he wasn't.  The mixture of culture, history, and music is writing at its best.  The complexity of Israel's character causes one to be revolted by him, feel sorrow for him, but at the same time admire him.  His naive and optimistic outlook on life may cause him suffering, but shows an indefatigable core of goodness tempered by reality.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the human character.	2002-08-21

The three major characters were struggling with issues and were acting according to philosphies they thought they believed; but then there is chance, irrational &quot;love&quot; (and who has yet figured that one out), and events of the world.  Pears shows that no one can ever direct their own fate.  We also learn that events are never quite what they seem, and those who are renown for good or bad may or may not deserve that status.  In short, I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in people and how we are all products of the world we live in regardless of how focused, directed, or philosophical we may think we are.	2002-07-22
US	53031601	RAWR2DHLX2LWP	0670030961	435397103	Mary, Called Magdalene	Books	2	47	57	N	Y	sadly disappointed	I absolutely loved the other Margaret George novels; this however is sadly disappointing.  I agree with the reviewer who said is is uninspired.  It reads like a young adult Sunday School lesson.  Mary's dialogue is so unbelievable; the setting is so &quot;clean&quot; and brings to mind 1950's Hollywood Bible stories.  I forced myself to read over half way through thinking it would get better, but it doesn't.  Margaret - you can do much better!	2002-07-15

Thankfully, the glossary at the back and the family tree in the front helped - otherwise, I would have given up.  But so worth the effort!!!  This is a beautiful story that is so well written I had trouble putting it down once I \\"caught the flow\\" of the story.  I only wish the glossary had been more complete.  For someone from the middle west instead of the Middle East, there were still many questions about some of the terms.  ( I actually got the World Book out and had to read some background on Egyptian history).  This is an excellent story for someone willing to take the time and make the effort to understand some of the many conflicts in our world today.	2002-07-08

Too many details are so contrived they make the entire story unbelievable.  No farmer would sew up his cow with a shoestring; school nurses do not work in a vacuum in a school - one just cannot be that isolated in a small town.  I got the feeling the author had a plot, developed some characters, but attempted to create a setting she knew nothing about.	2002-07-02

The reviewer who said the ending was \\"pathetic\\" was correct.  For my taste - far too many words to say little.	2002-06-13

Sometimes I asked myself why I was reading this; other times I felt compelled to read more.  Can't see that it could be called &quot;great literature&quot; but at the same time I found myself thinking about the characters when I wasn't reading.  Strange.	2002-05-31

Would be a 5 star if only the author had shown a bit more restraint; sometimes it is just too over the top.  Obviously, the historical look at medicine took a great deal of research and the \\"medical\\" scenes hold true.  It just seems as the author felt required to bring absolutely every sort of bizarre character and scene into the story as if to say \\"top this\\" and in the next chapter, she did.  It's not Michener, but it's still a good read.	2002-05-31

This is a wonderful story about ordinary people living in an extraordinary time and situation. Both the Germans and the English are presented as real people struggling with the times.

Also would point them to &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; - another wonderful Vermeer story	2001-06-12

I feel the book really lost credibility with the &quot;hog's head&quot; bit.  Using the complete head of the hog for food was (and still is)normal -- any poor rural person would understand this  -- the author apparently never heard of headcheese or jowl.  The ending was just too trite.  The book seemed to be a poorly written narrative about domestic violence without understanding the motivesof the characters.	2001-06-05

Great characters and some really funny dialogue in the midst of silent tragedy.	2001-05-30

I purchased this book from on &quot;on sale&quot; rack outside a bookstore - bought it because it was cheap.  What a find!  This is a great historical novel about a time in Mexico I knew very little about.  The setting and characters come alive as the reader begins to see the tremendous complexities of this time in Mexico.  Only drawback - a bit too many Spanish and French phrases (although usually easily figured out) and a bit too detailed in some of the battle scenes - lovers of battle strategies will love it.	2000-10-12

I'm not particularly a fan of American historical fiction and bought this for my husband, but after &quot;scanning&quot; the first few pages, I was pulled  in and found it difficult to put down.  The characterization was wonderful  and the interaction of the different characters both Mexican and Texian was  believable and memorable. Toured the Alamo once with a disinterested  attitude; now I have so much more respect for those individuals who played  such an important part in our country's history.  Great read!	2000-05-25

Now I read this book which is equally as memorable  as &quot;Tie that Binds&quot;  The characterization is so much on target  and the situations so realistic - perhaps one has to grown up in a very  small town in the country to understand this.  I say &quot;Amen&quot; to  all those positive reviews and encourage readers to also read &quot;Tie  that Binds.&quot;	2000-03-22

I heard the author interviewed on television and felt the book would be a good gift for a friend who has undergone a tragedy.  I &quot;skimmed&quot; the book when it arrived but was soon pulled into it and read it from start  to finish. Now I have to purchase another for my friend as I'm definitely  keeping this one.  I'm not Jewish (I'm Lutheran), and fortunately, I have  not undergone a terrible tragedy like many in the book.  However, this book  has so much to offer all of us regardless of our circumstances. It has  reaffirmed my belief in a  God who doesn't &quot;meddle&quot; in our lives,  but one that guides, supports, and loves us.  The author's stories come  from people she knows -- people just like all of us.  Her devotions are  short, simple, and true to the mark.  This book is a great treasure!	1998-11-11
