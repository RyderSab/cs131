I usually like her 'boy next door' ordinary heroes and heroines, but this 'ordinary' princess plays along the same line.  A satisfying read and a well-done happy ending.  From engagement, to wedding, to honeymoon.  She sends the happily-ever-after home and leaves you with a smile.	2004-05-25

What a pleasure-filled read!  Light-hearted and not the type of romantic comedy where the author is trying for punchlines all the time.  This was truly enjoyable.

I've loved Liz Fielding's writing for a while now, and each one gets better than the last.  The early banter-dialogue between hero and heroine (who's a real pip!) is superb.  I never knew there were so many wonderful ways to describe a man's smile.<br />I dare say this is a story without a conflict and I LOVED it--perhaps BECAUSE it didn't have something trite or misunderstood or some past hurt standing in their way of falling for each other.  And with such a well-written, satisfying ending.  It's a simple yet unique tale of a growing love between two great people and isn't that what romance is all about?  Don't even stop writing, Liz!	2003-07-05

Publishing in 1986, the numbers need updating (wish the author would consider a reprint!), but the truths still stand firm.  If you keep getting rejections from publishers, this author (a literary agent and book packager, who also co-authored WHAT THEY DON'T TEACH YOU AT HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL) pinpoints an approach by telling you how publishers think, then turning the tables and telling the reader how he has to &quot;package&quot; his product (manuscript) in order to sell it to them.	2003-04-04

It starts out with a very cute bachelor auction premise where the heroine wins the hero, but in the next chapter, for no good reason I can think of, it turns out the bachelor she won refuses the honor the win and throws her to his brother.  Then there's another chapter with him saying, &quot;I don't know what you're talking about.  I wasn't there.  No, I'm not him.&quot;  And her saying &quot;Yes, you're him.  You look too much like him not to be him.&quot;  Then the rest of the book refers to the hero over and over again as having been the bachelor at the auction!  Very confusing!  A cute story that had a lot of potential, but was very purely executed, and somehow all these errors it got past an editor without being caught.	2002-04-28
