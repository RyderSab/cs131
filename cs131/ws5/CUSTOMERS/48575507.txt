Ruthless 19th century capitalism (also known as &quot;capitalism at its finest&quot;) was not controlled or regulated by government, and offered no &quot;safety nets&quot; or benefits.  Many individuals and families lived the &quot;genteel life&quot; during the 19th century for  temporary periods, then were unceremoniously tossed off of the gravy train into the world of poverty.....a world for which they were often tragically unsuited, often even than those impoverished their entire lives.<br />The women's exchange movement provided relief for previously &quot;genteel&quot; women suddenly or gradually  reduced to circumstances bordering on desperation. In more than 70 American cities, a system of consignment retail shops was set up in which<BR>&quot;consignors&quot; (previously genteel but subsequently impoverished women) could offer domestic products (mostly sewing and needlework items) for sales anonymously.  The &quot;shame&quot; of impoverishment was hidden, capitalism's sins were uncomplained about, and some income for desperate women and their dependents was achieved. The brutal policing visited on those who complained about expoitation by the capitalist system was escaped.<br />The women's industrial exchange movement was remarkable for its ingenuity and its imagination, and also for its longevity.  Today, women's industrial exchange tea rooms and other facilities still operate and function, in some situations (as in Baltimore, Maryland) in facilities more than a century old.<br />At the dawn of the 21st century, the model and mentality of the women's industrial movement, described well by Dr. Sander, is a shining light of hope for impoverished people in a world where protections against capitalistic rapacity  and greed are clearly disappearing completely.  Neither government nor disappearing&quot;benefits&quot; (retirement pensions, health insurance, etc.) offered by companies to gullible employees seem likely to protect vulnerable people any longer.  The loss of government promised &quot;benefits&quot; in all catagories seems very likely for the great majority of citizens as the new century progresses.<br />Self-help actions independent of government and employers alike seem the best hope.  The women's industrial exchange movement of the 19th century is a splendid model of how independent self-help action can work.  It's truly inspiring, and a detailed history of its origins, successes, problems, and management such as that offered by Dr. Kathleen Sander is worth reading.	2003-05-16

Journalism School, well known along with the U. of Missouri Journalism School as the most prestigious in America. He's also a WALL STREET JOURNAL employee.  For all of the pretentions IN SAM WE TRUST (1998) makes of being a true muck-raking tome, the author's WALL STREET JOURNAL mentality and morality shines through to any who examine his book closely.<br />When all is said and done, Ortega has written a book which admires Wal-Mart, and is likely to do that organization no harm whatever. His provided backgrounder information about the nasty and unpleasant side of Wal-Mart doesn't affect the bottom-line, to use a phrase near and dear to Wal-Mart management, and to Ortega's mentor newspaper, the WALL STREET JOURNAL.<br />The book reminds me of the extravagant PATTON (1969) movie which appeared in the middle of the War In Vietnam, and told the story of General George S. Patton, Jr. and his activities during World War II. The expensive movie (for which the main actor won an Academy Award) provided very critical material about Gen. Patton, and showed his failures and personal problems in some detail.But, all in all, it was a hagiography which was said to have been screened often in the Nixon White House, and which the pro-war people of the Vietnam War era loved. For all its criticism, the movie admired Patton, and was a PR piece for pushy generals, the U.S. Army, and war as a catagory of human activity.<br />It's doubtful that Wal-Mart bigshots at company HQ in Bentonville, Arkansas lost any sleep over this book. Wal-Mart profits were probably boosted as a result of the book.  After all, it provided more publicity about Wal-Mart.  As movie star Erol Flynn was supposed to have said often, \\"I don't care what the newspapers say about me...just make sure they spell my name right.\\"<br />All this said, the book DOES reveal many interesting facts about Wal-Mart and by reflection, about America these days.<br />Wal-Mart's status as America's largest private employer is discussed.  By 1997, Wal-Mart had long since passed General Motors Corp. to achieve this status. The kind of work offered by Wal-Mart and other \\"big-box\\" type discount and \\"catagory killer\\" chains...  had REPLACED manufacturing to become the dominant new blue-collar job in the United States.  This kind of job offered far lower wages, fewer benefits, and less job security than the old manufacturing type job it replaced.<br />Ortega says the WALL STREET JOURNAL compared GM jobs with Wal-Mart jobs in 1997 and noted that the average GM wage was $19. per hour; at Wal-Mart $7.50 per hour.  With benefits included, GM compensation was worth $44. per hour; Wal-Mart's (for those who get benefits) was $10. per hour. Ortega rightfully concludes (but isn't necessarily unhappy about the fact that) Wal-Mart has become a mirror for the new American workplace where Federal employment figures showed that more than 30 percent of American workers hold only part-time or temporary jobs.<br />It's safe to conclude that when the new #1 employer in America offers less than 25% of income provided by the old #1 employer, Americans as a group are getting poorer.<br />IN SAM WE TRUST (1998) states that when a new Wal-Mart store arrives in a community, 75% of its profits are drawn from trade previously enjoyed by small, often \\"Ma and Pa\\" stores many of which cannot stand against Wal-Mart competition and soon close down. Author Orgega refers to this as \\"strip-mining\\" local commerce previously but no longer owned and operated locally, and uniquely responsive to local needs and pressures.<br />If Wal-Mart ever become history, and its services become unavailable in the 3000 plus locations where it now operates, the loss of the centrally controlled organization would impact the lives of many, many Americans.  The re-establishment of the many small business Wal-Mart bull-dozed into oblivion is not likely to provide relief to these Americans.<br />All this is worth thinking about, and for that reason, Bob Ortega's book IN SAM WE TRUST: The Untold Story of Sam Walton and How Wal-Mart Is Devouring American (1998) is worth buying and re-reading often.	2002-02-28

Dr. Ehrenreich's book offers neither an index nor a bibliography, however.  The absence of these makes her important book far less useful than would have been the case had they been provided.<br />Good as NICKELED AND DIMED (2001) is, the book is fraught with shortcomings.  It's a \\"is the glass half full or half empty?\\" situation.  Given the fact that so few widely distributed books on the subject of the War on the Poor in America are available in these days of the most recent (2002) Bush Dynasty presidency, I'm glad to have a half full glass, which beats the [heck] out of an empty one.<br />Doc Ehrenreich's description of her travails at [a local retailer] is very good.  The Evaluation chapter at the end of the book is also good.<br />The book is about several jobs the author took of the low level, almost minimum wage type.  It describes her experiences getting and handling these jobs, and also trying to pay her living expenses based on the scant income she received. She makes the true point that nobody could possibly survive on money provided by almost minimum wage jobs of the [local retailer] type.<br />In the early 70's, the president of Haverford College, Dr. John Coleman, who at the time was also president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, used part of his sabatical year to take three grim and grimey blue collar jobs of the unskilled, low paid type.  He, too, wrote a book about what he faced, and how he got through it all. It was called BLUE COLLAR JOURNAL (1974). Another good book.  Also with no index.  Also written by a Ph.D.<br />It's sort of the BLACK LIKE ME book idea, but without racial themes or problems. How the \\"other half\\" (other 80%?) live.<br />Well, Dr. Ehrenreich gets\\"A\\" for good intentions, and also for actually getting a book published about what's become almost a never discussed subject: dreadful jobs at low money in a high expense world (especially with regard to housing and transportation) and the efforts of people to survive it all.  <br />We owe a lot to Doc Ehrenreich for providing this book.<br />It's a shame, however, the needed index and bibliography are missing...and she certainly knows better.	2002-02-21

JULIA	YOU'LL NEVER EAT LUNCH IN THIS TOWN AGAIN (1991) was/is a touching autobiography written by the recently departed Julia Miller Phillips, born 1944, died New Year's Day, 2002.  She was the first female to receive a Best Movie Academy Award. She got it for THE STING (1973) at age 29. She also produced CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977) which featured French producer Francois Truffaut who died in 1984 at age 52.  Phillips was 57 years old when she died.  Part of the hugh army of Hollywood big shots who never made it to age 60.<br />     Her 1991 autobiography book, YOU'LL NEVER EAT LUNCH IN THIS TOWN was surrounded by publicity stating &quot;Julia Phillips has come out of retirement to write this book.&quot; She was 47 in 1991.  People don't &quot;retire&quot; at 47, and certainly don't &quot;emerge from retirement&quot; at that age.  She had lost all her money living the fast track Hollywood life, and decided to sell her privacy and that of others she knew over the years in Hollywood.  The result was a best selling book which made the number one slot on the New York Times Best Seller (non-fiction) list.  The book earned Phillips a lot of money, which she needed badly.<br />     Julia Phillips wrote a follow-up book in 1995 titled DRIVING UNDER THE AFFLUENCE, another attempt to cash in her willingness to engage in autobiographical tale-telling about Hollywood, big money, and her travails.  Unlike YOU'LL NEVER HAVE LUNCH IN THIS TOWN AGAIN (1991), the 1995 book had no index and generally was/is difficult to read easily and understand. About half of YOU'LL NEVER HAVE LUNCH AGAIN IN THIS TOWN (1991) suffered from this problem, but the remaining part was/is quite readable, interesting, and curiously touching.<br />      Both books were quite obviously written by a Hollywood burn-out lady going down for the third time. Going down in flames. Part of the text in the 1991 book and all of it in the 1995 book are veritable screams of pain and despair, pathetically and incompetently wrapped in  failed guise of smiling and humorous story telling.<br />      The two books constitute a detailed obituary far more informative and valuable than those which appeared a few weeks ago in most nationally important USA newspapers (I write this in late January 2002). An obituary written by a person obviously about to die, a person who knew her fate, and explained it in writing, in these two books.<br />       Yesterday, I completed an Amazon.Com review (not published yet, as of today, Jan. 15, 2002) about the HIGH CONCEPT (1998) postmortum analysis book by Hollywood author Charles Fleming about BEVERLY HILLS COP/TOP GUN movie producer Don Simpson (1943-1996) who died at age 52 sitting on the toilet of his 4 million dollar Bel Air, CA home, reading a book about Hollywood (a bio about movie director Oliver Stone).  YOU'LL NEVER EAT LUNCH IN THIS TOWN (1991) contained a 10 page description of a 1972 trip author Julia Phillips and Don Simpson, both then still in their late 20's, took together to NYC while both Warner Bros. employees.  It was a business trip.<br />      The next year, Phillips won the Best Picture Academy Award for THE STING (1973).  Eight years later Simpson was made the head of the Paramount Pictures movie studio in Hollywood reporting to Michael Eisner (then #2 man at Paramount Studios, not yet the Disney #1 man he later became), three years before Don Simpson and partner Jerry Bruckheimer began an independent movie producer partnership which resulted in 10 movies over a 13 year period which would earn three billion dollars at the boxoffice and in video stores, and provide Simpson personally with 40 million dollars income between 1983 and 1990 (and more between 1990 and his 1996 death at age 52).<br />      Now Phillips and Simpson are both dead.<br />      YOU'LL NEVER EAT LUNCH IN THIS TOWN (1991), DRIVING UNDER THE AFFLUENCE (1995), and HIGH CONCEPT (1998) are valuable books explaining at least partly the deaths of two productive, creative, intelligent people, children of the 60's who might have helped us all in important ways had they survived into the years of their old age.                                                                                                                                    It's a shame these two people are now dead.

Norman Podheretz, editor of COMMENTARY for 30 years, presents us with a must-read book of war stories about problematic celebrity friends of his.<br />    Poderhetz's crystal clear writing is a pleasure to read, and so especially are the explanations he provides about the writings and thinking of the subjects he describes in EX-FRIENDS: Falling Out With Allen Ginsberg, Lionel and Diana Trilling, Lillian Hellman, Hannah Arendt, and Norman Mailer.<br />    The author's writing is welcome because these folks are not always easy to understand.<br />     For instance, Poderetz explains that Norman Mailer thought that the social revolution of the 1960's would succeed because its advocates gained incredible strength by giving into ALL of their impulses as much as possible.  The inhibited opponents of that revolution, Mailer opines, couldn't and didn't compete in the &quot;giving into their impulses&quot; dept. and so didn't do as well.  Mailer cites Richard Nixon as an example of too much inhibition. That will shut people who thought Nixon was &quot;too emotional.&quot;<br />      I always wondered what Norman Mailer was talking about when I used to see him on talk shows like THE MERV GRIFFIN SHOW, but it took Podheretz to explain it to me!<br />      I always wondered when Allen Ginsburg stated he &quot;saw the best minds of his generation destroyed by madness,&quot; exactly which minds he was referring to.  Poderhetz doesn't get into that, but his Allen Ginsberg section is also worth reading.<br />      It's hard to be an editor.  H.L. Mencken was editor of the AMERICAN MERCURY in the 1920's and early 1930's, he, too, ran into a lot grief from prima donna writers of great talent but short fuses.<br />      Hooray for Norman Podheretz.

David Allyn's Harvard U. Ph.D. dissertation, repackaged in this book, MAKE LOVE NOT WAR: The Sexual Revolution, An Unfettered History (2000), is one of the very few books about that subject currently in print.  Mr. Allyn has not done a high quality job in treating his subject, but the fact he chose it at all at least keeps the subject alive and in public view, and may cause some future researcher/writer to pick up David Allyn's dropped baton and continue the race a further distance, hopefully with better results. Allyn's MAKE LOVE NOT WAR book is like Samuel Johnson's famous dog reported walking unassisted on its hind legs....never mind that it was not done skillfully....we should be grateful it was done at all.<br />     MAKE LOVE NOT WAR (2000) is almost completely a compendium of popular, mass press and periodical feature story and news coverage of sexual theme material which appeared during the 1960's and 1970's.  The mentality of most material reported is almost all airheaded, intentionally salacious stuff (as indeed is the final phrase of the book's subtitle...&quot;An Unfettered History&quot;).  Hugh Hefner's &quot;Playboy Philosophy&quot; reflects this mentality best and exemplifies it importantly, and it is no accident author Allyn zeroes in on the phenomena of Hefner, Playboy Magazine and its imitators, and similar slick stuff of those times which appeared.<br />      Hugh Hefner's opinion of the sexual revolution and its signifigance is not the stuff of which important scholarship and social and philosophical insight should be based, regardless of how profitable his magazine was in the 60's and 70's and still is.<br />      Meanwhile, issues of supreme importance such as the impact sexual behavior and sexually related human needs have on individual health are entirely ignored.  The term &quot;health&quot; does not appear in thebook's index because, indeed, it is not discussed or investigated as a central topic. <br />      The management and intellectual investigation of sexual needs and behavior is an important but ignored subject, mostly outlawed and forbidden throughout recorded history.  The Sexual Revolution of the 1960's and 1970's, clumsy and temporary as it was (and as poorly documented and analyzed as it was), was a landmark exception to this dreary situation, an exception we are not likely to see repeated in the life time of the people who lived through it. Those people are now entering their 60's.  They are still with us, still available to be interviewed.  <br />      Hopefully, some future writer/researcher will consider this subject in the future carefully and skillfully.  When and if that happens (as it did not happen with MAKE LOVE NOT WAR), human society will be the better for it.	2001-12-20

Perdita Huston's FAMILIES AS WE ARE (2001), published by The Feminist Press of the City University of New York, is an astonishing book likely to change government policy and ideas about support for families everywhere.  Huston is a feminist former government administrator (Peace Corps Regional Director for North Africa, the Near East, Asia, the Pacific, and Peace Corp chief in both Mali and Bulgaria) whose writing is a pleasure to read.... interesting, compelling, literary, easy to read, and substantial.<br />       She takes her reader on an armchair round the world tour of visits to representative families in Japan, Thailand, Bangladesh, China, Mali, Uganda, Egypt, Jordan, Brazil, El Salvador, and the USA.  Her in depth interviews make the important point that families around the world are alive and well, and surviving in new and different, often imaginative ways sometimes controversial, but destined to be accepted in time by people who may now question the need for change and new solutions to problems of family survival.  Government action and policy changes are needed to support family survival efforts Huston describes, and she makes a good case for looking at old, classical problems in new ways.<br />       Former U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard C. Holbrooke, author of TO END A WAR, offers a touching Foreward to Perdita Huston's book, and states &quot;she is, in her way, still the scribe of Constantinois, writing down the words and thoughts of the voiceless, helping give them shape and, above all, giving them to us.&quot;  Ambassador Holbrooke clearly admires Perdita Huston, and anyone who reads her wonderful book can quickly understand why.<br />       Huston's book is a curious and wonderful combination of hard, politically shocking facts and quiet, humane reflection and communication about delicate and often undiscussed and unrevealed important needs human beings have around the world, needs not confined to particular regions or countries of the world.  Problems Perdita Huston reveals in FAMILIES AS WE ARE (2001) are truly universal.  They exist worldwide, far away and also in our own back yards.  They are not to be run away from.  They are to be faced carefully and intelligently.<br />        Perdita Huston is a new kind of feminist.  Her communications style is refreshingly diplomatic and careful.  It calls for solutions to problems without scapegoats or bromides.  Implicitly, Huston invites non-Feminist females and sympathetic males to join Feminists concerned about the very subject of families, their survival, and resources they need.  FAMILIES AS WE ARE (2001) sets a new standard in Feminist communications and polemics, and is bound to make friends for Feminism and its goals worldwide. Hopefully, other Feminists will notice her new style, and give us more of the same.<br />        Perdita Huston provides us with important information about an important subject not to be ignored or trivialized....the survival of the family as an institution.  Her words are bound to bring tears to the eyes of readers, and to make them call for government action and change as it concerns the subject of the family. <br />        All this said, FAMILIES AS WE ARE (2001) is a hopeful and optimistic book, truly memorable and likely to become a classic read and re-read by thoughtful people for decades to come.  We owe a lot to Perdita Huston for writing it.	2001-07-07

Clark wrote THE DISTINCTIVE COLLEGE: ANTIOCH, REED, AND SWARTHMORE. His highly influential book was a best seller of the times which argued, intelligently, that consumers seeking higher liberal arts education do well to avoid &quot;me-too&quot; and &quot;wanna-be&quot; accredited higher ed diploma mills in favor of &quot;distinctive&quot; colleges.  Such places, he stated, are known not only for distinguished, high accomplishment, high energy alumni, but also for being genuinely &quot;interesting and distinctive,&quot; populated by obviously dynamic and intellectually articulate and outspoken undergraduates. Clark also suggested other guideposts and evidences of &quot;distinctive,&quot; meant in a positive, desireable sense.<br />       His book was regarded as very important in a time of high intellectual ferment and soul searching in America, and in the world, generally.  It deserved to be.<br />       Of the three &quot;ideal&quot; colleges examined, Clark's obvious favorite was Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, 60 miles north of Cincinnati.  The famous school was founded in 1852 by Massachusetts intellectual rebels in the decade prior to the American Civil War of 1861-65, and intended as an alternative  to establishment schools of the times, especially Harvard.  Horace Mann, then a U.S. congressman, was chosen to serve as Antioch's first president (1852-1859).  Prior to his congressional service, Mann had set up the first widespread public education system in the USA (in Massachusetts), and became known as the &quot;father of American public education.&quot;  Interestingly, his successor, a Dr. Hill, served only briefly as Antioch president before being selected to become president at Harvard in Massachusetts, the school Antioch had been set up to improve upon.<br />       The establishment of Antioch College in Ohio was a national pre-Civil War event, reported in the New York Times and all across the USA, then less than 100 yearsold. Over the following 149 years (I write this in June, 2001), the New York Times was to devote a great deal of coverage to Antioch College (several pages of the current print version of the NYT Index are devoted to Antioch) as the school repeatedly called attention to itself, its students, and the proposition that higher education in America is not a dull subject.  Love it or hate it, no-one could deny that Antioch College in Ohio has always been an &quot;interesting&quot; school, and being &quot;interesting,&quot; argued Dr. Clark in the 1960's, is the first and most important quality of &quot;the distinctive college.&quot;<br />     Now, the advice of sage Chinese (which is not all of them) on the subjecting of &quot;being interesting&quot; is reflected in a famous Chinese curse which, roughly translated, is &quot;May you be born in interesting times.&quot;  What does this tell us about &quot;interesting&quot; colleges?<br />     One thing it tells us, by implication, is that any truly &quot;interesting&quot; college is going to experience rough, controversial, and highly risky times, and is likely to be subjected not only to praise and high regard (of the type delivered to Antioch College by Dr. Burton Clark in the 1960's), but also to criticism, unfair and untrue defamation, and even physical attacks.  Antioch College in Ohio has experienced all of these, certainly in much higher quantities than the other two &quot;distinctive&quot; colleges mentioned in the title of Clark's book, Reed and Swarthmore (both far quieter, and, one might conclude, less &quot;interesting&quot; places than Antioch).<br />        But like another uniquely American institution, the Mississppi River, Antioch College in Ohio still &quot;keeps rolling along.&quot;  It's been up (was one of America's most prestigious colleges in the 1950's and 1960's), and it's been down (following problems in the mid-1970's, its prestige dropped quite a bit for a temporary period, then returned in the late 1980's), but it's never been out.  A book devoted only to reprints of New York Times coverage of Antioch College in Ohio over 149 years would make interesting reading, and would as well be an important comment on American higher education at its best.<br />       Burton C. Clark's THE DISTINCTIVE COLLEGE: ANTIOCH, REED, AND SWARTHMORE is an important book.

The television documentary series he created was actually intended to discourage revolutionary thought and activity (Lord Clark's final pontifical message delivered at the very end of the final episode of the series), and thus could and should be regarded as a predictable bit of [...] delivered by one of the then high priests of the British Establishment defending property and privilege of the monied classes. <br />       Even so, a curious and wonderful side effect resulted from Clark's effort.<br />       Clark's very effective tactic in lending grave authority to his final anti-revolution message was to summarize in considerable detail great efforts of civilized peoples over roughly 1500 years of European history as reflected and demonstrated by works of great art and architecture. He guides us from the \\"dark\\" part of the middle ages to the present (1960's) and offers his considerable expertise and familiarity with high points of \\"civilisation\\" reflected by great works of art, and in so doing creates himself, in a low key, charming British way, as an authority on his overall subject.<br />       When his final message discouraging revolutionary thought and activity is delivered gravely during the last 10 minutes of the 13 hour documentary film effort, the implicit point is that all the great creators of art seen in the previous 13 hours would agree with Kenneth Clark's anti-revolutionary sentiments.<br />       Well, one can't blame monied, propertied, and privileged people for moving to protect their enviable situations through efforts like Kenneth Clark'sCIVILISATION (1969).  The revolutionary fervor of the times he was worried about, now almost half a century past, died down, and the forces he represented so skillfully in CIVILISATION certainly got and held the \\"upper hand\\" in the decades which followed the 60's. The smashing of the revolutionary spirit of the 1960's no doubt owes a great deal to the likes of Kenneth Clark and films/books like CIVILISATION (1969). New York City historian Rick Perlstein recently wrote a book about how the widespread liberal consensus of the 1960's was reversed by the efforts of Barry Goldwater and his supporters.  The fact is that many efforts were made to change the trends of those times, and arguably, those efforts succeeded.<br />        All of this said, Lord Kenneth Clark created the very best and most digestable tour of the truly great works of European art and architecture ever produced before or since. Regardless of one's opinion of his political and social motives, the 12 hours and 50 minutes which came BEFORE his final 10 minute sermon opposing the 60's revolution constitute a masterful and compelling summary of truly great fine art and architecture.  Any person who desires the best possible education regarding the subject of art and culture in Europe at its best during the past 1000+ years owes it to him or herself to see the entire 13 hour video series titled CIVLISATION (1969) and also to obtain and re-read often the \\"print version\\" of that work.<br />       Since Kenneth Clark produced CIVILISATION (1969) almost half a century ago, the cultural world has changed considerably for the worse. Educational institutions and media neither aspire to nor are successful at creating cultured people. Cultured conversation or familiarity seem to exist almost nowhere. Classic culture is no longer the result of higher education, nor, it seems safe though sad to say, of any education presently available at all, anywhere.  The world, culturally, has returned to the Dark Ages, as it does from time to time.<br />       Kenneth Clark's work, CIVILSATION (1969), is a gleaming precious gem amidst the present darkness.  It's out of print and hard to find, but it's not gone completely.  Those who know of its existence, and who know where valuable cultural works like CIVLISATION (1969) can still be gotten needn't be gloomy, nor need they worry about the present dark times.	2001-06-04

Ten years ago, then recently appointed Harvard sociology professor Juliet B. Schor wrote a disarmingly truthful book, titled THE OVERWORKED AMERICAN, about the dramatically lowered yet unpublicized quality of life in America.  She claimed, accurately, that work in America is overdone and overemphasized, wheras leisure and &quot;quality time&quot; away from work is underdone. Her very worthwhile book became a New York Times listed best seller, then shot into obscurity with amazing, almost devastating rapidity. <br />         A decade later, following eight years of the Clinton administration's non-stop, machine gun style propaganda campaign advising America it &quot;never had it so good&quot; (quality of life-wise), Schor's book is almost forgotten, never discusssed seriously, and not regarded as what in fact it was and is, one of the great and important classic works by a scholar on the subject of labor in America at the close of the twentieth century.<br />       Schor has gone on to write other, far less impressive books.  Her recent books lack the gusto and fervor of THE OVERWORKED AMERICAN (1991), and are not about subjects as important.  She seems, de facto, to have joined the people who nay-sayed the importance of her 1991 book.  That's a shame, because the book was good, she was right to write it, and deserved/deserves far more acclaim and gratitude than she got when, it seems, she stuck her then young neck out and told the truth about a painful and politically incorrect subject, the brutal yet undiscussed and mostly unchallenged bad conditions which face American workers.<br />       Her book, THE OVERWORKED AMERICAN, had implications discussed only by Ralph Nadar among Presidential candidates in the 2000 elections, and only briefly and superficially by him.<br />       Do get a hard-back copy of this book (the paperback, which I haven't read, may well lack some of the good stuff included in the hard-back version....changes occur when hard back books appearin paper-back versions). ... if sold new today, and tells the truth about the American labor situation and quality of life situation not found elsewhere at any price.<br />      Sometimes, only old books tell the truth about important subjects.  That's what classics, even ones not yet accorded &quot;classic&quot; status, are all about.	2001-05-21

Perlstein has done a good job in examining an important subject.  His book is thoughtful, readable, and perhaps most important of all, the most complete treatment of the subject &quot;how did the present political mess begin?&quot; written anywhere.<br />     The author presents us with a scholarly book (more than 100 pages of skillfully prepared, interesting notes) which happily is also compelling and easy to read.  <br />     Rick Perlstein is a street smart, provocative intellectual whose writing is worth getting to know.  He's only 32 years old (born in 1969), and BEFORE THE STORM (2000) is an astonishing book likely to be the first of many from this energetic new voice.  Buy this book and read it.  Recommend it to public libraries and political science professors, as well as local political clubs, left of right.  Perlstein tells it like it was about the 60's and why the political dominos fell the way they did.<br />      Hopefully more equally detailed books by Perlstein will be forthcoming before the television moguls invite him to join the ranks of Sunday afternoon pundits.  His voice will be welcome as an addition to that increasingly lackluster throng, but when his career skyrockets into the TV realm, he probably won't have time to do what he's done for us in BEFORE THE STORM, provide a genuinely complete, worthy, and dynamic study of an important  political question few have done justice to until now.	2001-03-09

Peg Bracken (Mrs. John Ohman of Portland, Oregon), renowned author of THE I HATE TO COOK BOOK and ten other equally worthwhile published works, is now past age 80, and like Frank Lloyd Wright, still working full time at what she does best, satiric essay writing with a homespun yet bitingly witty edge.  Ms. Bracken is a 1940 graduate of Ohio's famous Antioch College, one of the world's most important and individualistic higher education centers.  Peg Bracken is certainly a daughter of Antioch, individualistic, outspoken, charming, and intelligent in ways disarming, yet very easy to relate to and admire.<br />     The subject of her latest book is Old Age, and she writes about her subject in her well known humorous way in almost a journalistic style.  Her writing about her personal experiences as an &quot;Older Person&quot; is what the American Association For Retired Persons magazine should offer, but, sadly, never does. It is relevant, poignant, and filled with important observations skillfully cradled in diplomatic and humane style, always self-deprecating and fraught with wit and humor created by a person obviously born with a gift in those areas.<br />     Peg Bracken really covers her subject in almost all areas one could wish and does so in only 125 pages, happily presented in readable, larger than average typeface, ideal for comfortable reading and reflecting.<br />     I read the first chapter of ON GETTING OLD FOR THE FIRST TIME in a Cockeysville, Maryland (suburban Baltimore) public library, and found myself laughing out loud so noisily that the usually tolerant librarians on duty were forced to make several visits to my reading location, and ask me to quiet down.  I really did try to accommodate them, but Peg Bracken's wit is so astonishing and infectious, I finally realized that, for me, her book would only be readable in a non-public location.  It's too funny for public library located consumption.<br />      This said, it should be noted her subject matter is very serious, and the implied conclusions raised by her intelligent writing constitute the best food for thought I've ever read by any author, ancient or modern, on the subject of Old Age.<br />      Get this book and read it.  Buy it.  Keep it at home, and re-read it again and again over the years.  Encourage your local public library system, nursing homes, retirement communities, and booksellers to stock multiple copies at all times, and to publicize it continuously.  This modest little book is a classic, and though the self-effacing Ms. Bracken would likely be the first to deny it, a true work of genious.  In today's world, we need all the genious and wisdom we can get, especially on the subject of Old Age.	2001-02-16

Birdwell of the University Of Tennesse's Center For The Study Of War And Society has authored an interesting, detailed, and scholarly yet readable book about intentional efforts by Hollywood's Warner Brothers Movie Studios to encourage USA entrance into World War II during a pre-war period characterized by massive social and political opposition to war entry by still famous groups such as the Charles Lindbergh led America First group, and also by more than 300 other anti-war entry groups identified by the Roosevelt administration's pro-war FBI in 1938.<br />  Dr. Birdwell explains that the Warner Brothers' effort to encourage hostility to the German government through use of Hollywood movies began in the early thirties, and was particularly the result of the fervor of Harry Warner, the &quot;head&quot; Warner brother, a devout religious Jew who tried without success to purchase Germany's largest movie studio called UFA, producer of famous 1920's German silent classics including THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI and METROPOLIS.  As Dr. Birdwell tells the tale, Harry Warner was just about to close the UFA purchase deal when the Nazis came to power in 1933, and stopped German business dealings with Jewish owned and/or dominated companies like Warner Brothers.<br />  Harry Warner became very angry at this rebuff, and began his own personal war with Germany which, Dr. Birdwell argues, resulted importantly in the USA decision to join and support that war, which went on to cost more than half a million American lives.<br />  Anti-war politicians of the 1930's put many roadblocks in Mr. Warner's way, including especially the Neutrality Act of the mid-1930's, which forbade negative characterization of America's then trading partners, in which ranks Germany numbered prominently.  This did not deter Mr. Warner whose efforts began with a 1936 Warner Brothers cartoon, and then with a live action movie titled BLACK LEGION about one of the many anti-Black, anti-Jewish political groups active in the 1930's.  All seven of the major Hollywood studios of the 1930's were owned and run by American Jews (the Disney studio was not, but was tiney compared to the others, and could not be called a true peer of the &quot;majors&quot; in 1930's Hollywood).<br />  The Harry Warner anti-German campaign included movies such as DR. EHRLICH'S MAGIC BULLET (about the Jewish research scientist who found a cure for venereal disease) and others which celebrated accomplishment by Jews. It also included a series of short subjects, shown in movie houses along with cartoons, etc. to supplement feature films, titled the Old Glory series, which identified Jews prominent in American history, including Chaim Solomon who helped finance the American Revolutionary War, and the Levi family who bought Thomas Jefferson's Monticello mansion, lived in it for almost 100 years, then set up the foundation which still operates and makes tours of Jefferson's home available to the public.<br />  Feature movies of various types were also produced to support the pro-war entry cause, including SERGEANT YORK (about a conscientious objector during WWI who changed his mind and became a winner of the Congressional Medal Of Honor) starring Gary Cooper (who won an Academy Award for his role) and CASABLANCA (about an expatriate American in Morocco who distains politics, but suddenly is converted to the anti-German cause in the last moments of the film) starring Humphrey Bogart (the film won an Academy Award for &quot;best picture,&quot; and interestingly includes Conrad Veidt starring as the German villain, &quot;Major Strasse,&quot; 20 years after Veight starred in Germany's most famous movie of the 1920's, THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI, a UFA production).<br />  Movies which celebrated England and partiotism on England's behalf (such as ROBIN HOOD and THE SEA HAWK, both starring Warner Brothers Australian born movie star, Errol Flynn) were produced to overcome American antipathy, thenwidely prevalent, for helping England maintain her Empire.<br />  After USA entrance into the war, the efforts of Warner Brothers (and other studios) to support USA war activity continued, and included the participation of a Warner Brothers contract player (in a movie titled THIS IS THE ARMY) who later became the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan.<br />  Dr. Bridwell's book is worth reading.  It is an important addition to the literature of books published over the decades, and longer, about the place of propaganda in propagating and encouraging participation in wars, even when those wars are unpopular, as WWII was in the eyes of many Americans before USA entrance into WWII.widely prevalent, for helping England maintain her Empire.<br />  After USA entrance into the war, the efforts of Warner Brothers (and other studios) to support USA war activity continued, and included the participation of a Warner Brothers contract player (in a movie titled THIS IS THE ARMY) who later became the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan.<br />  Dr. Bridwell's book is worth reading.

The American Enterprise Institute's enfant terrible Dartmouth College grad author (his 1991 book, ILLIBERAL EDUCATION: The Politics Of Race And Sex caused quite a stir), Dinesh D'Souza (born in India, became a USA citizen in 1991) has written a very interesting book titled THE VIRTUE OF PROSPERITY (2000).  It's about the moral and ethical aspects of the present highly touted USA wealth &quot;boom,&quot; and it asks the intelligent question, is all this so-called &quot;wealth&quot; really success?<br />     D'Souza points out early in his book that techno-capitalism in the present age has created enormous inequalities, has undermined families and communities, and has all but destroyed many of  our (previously) most cherished values.  He asks the question &quot;how can we learn to be happy with out 'success'?&quot;<br />     Well, being sponsored by the unabashedly right-wing, pro-capitalism American Enterprise Institute (a Washington, D.C. &quot;think tank&quot; dedicated to telling it the way right-wingers think it is), Mr. D'Souza doesn't really join the attack on what's happened to equality, families, communities, and values.  He is rather an unabashed apologist for &quot;aren't these great times&quot; crowd.  After all, he's been on their payroll since finishing Dartmouth in the early 80's (and prepared for it by working as a student staffer on the infamous DARTMOUTH REVIEW, then America's most famous conservative student publication).<br />       Even so, agree with Mr. D'Souza or not, he does raise many very intelligent and interesting questions, and provides a generous amount of space in his 284 page book for the opposing side to tell its story.  His book is worth buying and reading, and offers several valuable features, most especially his well organized and extensive chapter end notes (he was highly praised for similar notes provided in his book ILLIBERAL EDUCATION).<br />      The first part of THE VIRTUE OF PROSPERITY is the best part.  Dinesh D'Souza provides a well written and intelligent backgrounder to the various issues and situations surrounding the current &quot;good times.&quot;  He asks the question &quot;What's new about the new economy?&quot; and comes up with interesting points and answers.  He points out, for instance, that the world's richest man, Bill Gates of Microsoft, was worth in 2000 a cool (or hot) $100 billion (net worth).  In contrast, John D. Rockefeller at his peak was worth a paltry $17 billion in today's money.  D'Souza observes that Bill Gates and his descendants could spend $10 million A DAY IN PERPETUITY and NEVER run out of money. Now that's wealth!  If Bill were a country, he would be number thirty five in the world rankings, surpassing the gross domestic products of Hungary, Ireland, Israel, and New Zealand!  He ranks just ahead of Finland, and just behind Greece.<br />       An unlike John D., it didn't take him long to get where he is.  The author wows us with other (many other) statistics of this sort, and in so doing, allows his book to take on the personality of sort of research scholars versions of WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?<br />       The best part of the book follows.  D'Souza gets down to a serious discussion of mass affluence and its discontents in a chapter titled The Gathering Storm.  He then moves on to discuss the subject of &quot;merit,&quot; and the many people it leaves behind.  He states that success must at times be regarded as a lottery, and explains who wins, and who loses.<br />       By far, the best chapter in the book is titled Eye Of The Needle: The Moral Critique Of Prosperity.  This is followed by a poignant chapter titled The World We Have Lost: Goodbye Nature, Family, and Community.<br />       Get this book and read it.  The cult of prosperity and affluence has been touted by a very self-interested lot of politicians, businessmen, and others the late H.L. Mencken would have called &quot;wowzers.&quot;  Their hidden agenda is almost unexamined in current literature or mass media, and Dinesh D'Souza's book, THE VIRTUE OF PROSPERITY comes as close as any I have read to getting down to the nitty gritty about what really has happened, and what it all means.	2001-01-19

Bennett, past secretary of Education and also National Endowment For The Humanities under Ronald Reagan and past War Against Drugs Czar for President George H. W. Bush, has written a terrific book absolutely everyone everywhere should own, read and re-read often.<br />His book titled THE DEATH OF OUTRAGE: Bill Clinton and the Assault on American Ideals (1998), published by the Free Press division of Simon and Shuster, is a monument to clear thinking and get-to-the-point analysis on a critical subject for all Americans, the U.S. Presidency and what Mr. Clinton has done with it and to it during his eight years in office.<br />Mr. Bennett learned well the lessons Harvard Law School professors taught him about stating his case clearly and briefly, always caring to put forward his most powerful arguments up front. <br />His book is a slim one, only 154 pages long.  His main arguments are stated very clearly and persuasively in the first four pages of his thoughtful Introduction.  His writing style is crisp, clear, unpretentious, and a pleasure to read.  Beyond question, William Bennett is a &quot;user friendly&quot; writer, and we need all of those we can get.  He's an Ivory Tower person, yet thankfully not afflicted with the frequent Ivory Tower disease of inarticulate expression.<br />He states that Bill Clinton and his close supporters reacted to criticism of Mr. Clinton's misconduct during his time in office (both as Governor of Arkansas and as U.S. President) in wrong ways which included diversion, half-truth, equivocation, and sophistry (&quot;sophistry&quot; is defined as a plausible but misleading or fallacious argument).  They tried to trivialize the charges laid against Mr. Clinton, but, according to Mr. Bennett, without success.<br />Bennett states that the charges against Clinton DO matter, and explains why.  He analyses what the public reaction to them means, and asserts that Bill Clinton has inflicted grave social and political damage on America.<br />He says that the president's behavior, far from being irrelevant to the conduct of his affairs, severely restricted his ability to govern.  He states that the unprecedented recklessness of the Clinton administration in everything from influence peddling to sexual misconduct to alarming tactics of intimidation have been genuinely history making.  He argues that Mr. Clinton and his defenders have exploited the natural tolerance of the American people, and made a mockery of the rule of law.<br />Most interestingly, William Bennett states that the Clinton scandals (a plural word, to be sure) are neither trivial nor independent of one another, but rather are connected.<br />He states that the Bill Clinton presidency is truly a shameful chapter in American history, and implies that Mr. Clinton's misbehavior must not be forgotten, unanalyzed, or forgiven.<br />William Bennett's excellent book, written two years ago (I write this review in December 2000), is especially timely in the present circumstances.  Mr. Clinton seems determined to continue a role of power and influence after his second presidential term ends in January 2001.  His wife, Senator Hilary Clinton of New York, is THE prime U.S. Democrat Presidential candidate for the 2004 election, and Mr. Clinton leaves no doubt as to whom his wife's most influential advisor and quarterback will be.<br />If Bill Clinton is allowed to return to power, the future most likely will be a replay of the well known past. William Bennett's wonderful book articulates better than any other similar book on a similar subject what that past has been, what it has meant to Americans, and by implication, what it will mean in the future if Bill Clinton returns to center stage.	2000-12-30

Eileen Mears has edited a great &quot;tell it like it is&quot; book about farm life as described by farm ladies all across America.  Her book, titled A TREASURY OF FARM WOMEN'S HUMOR (1994) packs about 120 essays and short stories into 283 pages.<br />Living on a farm (I have lived on a 50 acre farm in Maryland for the past seven years) has its delightful side, but it is not easy for anyone.  The life of farm ladies has gone largely unsung or adequately described, and has seldom been a source of humor, with the possible exception of mercifully departed &quot;farmer's daughter&quot; traveling salesmen's jokes, now justifably out of fashion.<br />This good spirited book is a breath of fresh air, and should be considered a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone who ever ruminated about &quot;getting away from it all.&quot;  The essays the 120 ladies who contributed to A TREASURY OF FARM WOMEN'S HUMOR have given us provides wothwhile insight into what REALLY awaits people who give up city and suburban life for life in the sticks.  It's not only funny, it's informative in important ways.<br />The frustrations of farm life are many, and the essays in this book describe ways farm people deal which such frustrations, using imagination, invention, and on occasion, eccentricity. <br />It's hard for farm ladies to stay ladylike when they are called upon to feed hogs and chickens, and they say so, somehow without really complaining, God bless them.<br />Dealing with farm husbands (farmers) is a frequent topic of discussion and observation in this book.  Farmers are self-employed people who work out of their homes, and co-habiting with anyone in such a situation is not easy.  Beyond the humor of the essays provided, the particulars and dilemmas of such co-habitation are pointed up.  Farm life has a lot of freedom, but it also has a lot of solitude and headaches.  The neighbors might be available and willing to give you the shirt off their backs, but the neighbors also have their own problems, and live a good distance away in addition, even close neighbors.<br />This is a terrific little book.  It tells it like it is about farm living, and keeps its chin up while accomplishing its purpose of imparting truth and wisdom. It offers valuable information about farm life non-farm people can never know about without a book like this to lay things bare for them.<br />Get it and read it.  You'll be doing yourself a favor.	2000-12-27

Monica's status as &quot;Queen for a Day.&quot; Monica's reaction to Clinton's second TV address. Mr. Speights as alawyer. Stein and Cacheris as lawyers for Monica. Her strategy to lie about her relationship with Clinton and her affidavit about that subject. Her tanturm when Eleanor Mondale saw Bill Clinton.

Monica's Valentine's Day message to Clinton (very romantic!). Her VANITY FAIR photo, and many, many more splendid details, all guaranteed to satisfy.<br />The dignity and splendor of the Clinton White House will live on forever thanks to this great book.  It is truly a winner.  It deals with many other anti-Clinton subjects than Monica, but the handling of Monica is by far the best part of the book and the best treatment of the entire subject to be found ANYWHERE!<br />Read this book.

George Soros is one of New York City's richest Wall Street zillionaires, and got his money by organizing and profiting quite a bit from  Soros Fund Management in Manhatten.  His Quantum Fund is one of Wall Streets biggest and most profitable (for investors participating in it).  He was born in 1930 in Hungary and completed study at the London School Of Economics in 1952.  He left Europe for America, and got rich in the money biz, just like his famous fellow Hungarian Jew, Nicholas Deak (shot by his secretary at age 80, but whose famous name still lives on all over the world under the banner of the Deak-Perrera Foreign Exchange organization, the largest money changing company on the planet).<br />Mr. Soros promotes himself and his business organization by writing books published by vanity press operations.  His 1998 book titled THE CRISIS OF GLOBAL CAPITALISM  was cranked out in a month by the famous Peter Osnos, publisher extraordinare, and mover and shaker of the Perseus Books Group, and its Public Affairs label. Soros pays a ton of money (which he can certainly afford) to foot the cost of printing, binding, and shipping, gratis, to libraries, bookstores, etc., etc. all over the planet.  George Soros knows about and believes in skillful public relations, and he should.  His past P.R. efforts have helped importantly to build his fortune.<br />All this may sound unsavory, but the irony is that George Soros offers, in THE CRISIS OF GLOBAL CAPITALISM, an excellent read  which probably wouldn't have seen the light of day had he been a pennyless writer trying to interest publishers in a book attacking big money in the USA and the world, and the abuses of the big money establishment.  His book is terrific and everyone who cares about America and the impact of careless and unscrupulous big money should buy it and read it many times over.<br />Soros pulls no punches.  &quot;What I predict,&quot; he states directly and without apology, &quot;is the imminent disintegration ofthe global capitalist system.&quot;  This is not Karl Marx asking the workers of the world to unite.  It's a rich Wall Street guy who likely eats $300 per plate dinners at Manhatten's snootiest restaurants very, very often.  Mr. Soros is worth listening to and heeding.<br />He's written a lot attacking his fellow capitalists in recent years.  In February 1997, he wrote an ATLANTIC MONTHLY article, much discussed at the time, titled &quot;The Capitalist Threat.&quot;<br />George Soros states that the capitalist system is deeply flawed.  &quot;As long as capitalism remains triumphant, the pursuit of money overrides ALL OTHER SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS! Economic and political arrangements are out of kilter.  The development of a global economy has NOT BEEN MATCHED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GLOBAL SOCIETY!........If and when the global economy falters,&quot; (he implies it is certain to do so soon) &quot;political pressures are liable to tear it apart.&quot;<br />Soros dissects the current crisis and economic theory in general, revealing how theoretical assumptions have combined with human behavior to result in dangerous local and world crisis.  He shows how unquestioning faith in market forces (touted by politicians in the USA for the past two decades) blinds people to crucial instabilities and how those instabilities have chain reacted to cause the current crisis, a crisis he concludes has the potential to get much, much worse.<br />This is the most important and worthwhile part of his message.  He sugarcoats the end of his book with suggestions not very enthusiastically or hopefully offered.  All in all, his book is pessimistic, and must be regarded as such.<br />Buy and read this wonderful book, especially Part II, Chapter 6 titled &quot;The Global Capitalistic System.&quot;  If Karl Marx and other Communists over the past century had made THEIR anti-capitalist case as convincingly, maybe the Soviet Union and other similar political entities wouldn't have fallen apart anddisappeared forever.  There may be nothing that can be done about the present sad situation, but it is worth thinking about, and comforting, oddly, that a man like George Soros has found the skillful words to describe what's really going on.	2000-12-15

First Lady of the Land (now also U.S. Senator from New York USA) Hillary Clinton offers us a $35...glossy cocktail table style book filled with photos of life at the very top of the American government. We see a world filled with tuxedoed swells and scads of original art work as far as the eye can see. The White House army of...interior designers, butlers, chefs, maids, social secretaries, and other assorted lackeys go all out to present a show which Cecil B. DeMille, rest his soul, would find impressive.  Beyond question, as Mrs. Clinton's book and commentary prove, that show is not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste.<br />What are we to make of the spectacle offered so unapologetically in AN INVITATION TO THE WHITE HOUSE: A Home With History?  <br />The point of the book is to explain why what goes on at the White House goes on.<br />Mrs. Clinton explains that all the fancy dress partying and assorted hoopla serves good purposes.  Among these are welcoming &quot;the world&quot; (i.e. kings, queens, heads of state, captains of industry, and movers and shakers of various types), &quot;celebrating&quot; American arts and culture, honoring Americans, and showing the rest of us how such holidays as Christmas should be &quot;done&quot; when these are really &quot;done up right.&quot;<br />Mrs. Clinton offers a stack of recipes from the White House kitchen(s) at the end of the book, featuring such good old down home American dishes as smoked salmon on potato pancakes with wheat berry caviar and chive cream (which, we are told, yields 16 salmon rosettes on potato pancakes with garnish).  For people who like to eat buffalo(s), Mrs. Clinton suggests a tempting recipe for &quot;Grilled Bison Filet with spring vegetables, crimini mushroom saute, and cabernet sauce.&quot; Cabernet, when it's really jazzy, is usually French, but the patriotic Mrs. Clinton advises us to &quot;use a good California cabernet for the sauce.&quot; Why not?  <br />...we are treated to panoramic full page views of various recently redecorated White House rooms, such as The Blue Room, which give ample evidence that the supervising decorators truly thought two miles of blue and gold fabric plastered all over the walls to match the same colors on the carpet are twice as good as one mile of such fabric (that's a lot of fabric for just a single room, and the book shows that the White House is filled with such rooms, all decorated by the Clintons inspired by the same level of taste and restraint).<br />We meet and are treated to photos of such White House staffers as Chief Floral Designer Nancy Clarke (a GS 15, perhaps?), Social Secretary Capricia Penavic Marshall, Chief Usher Gary Walters, butlers Smiley Saint-Aubin, Buddy Carter, and James Ramsey, Social Secretary Ann Stock, Deputy Social Secretary Ann McCoy, and of course, the unforgetable Ms. Kaki Hockersmith, identified (with deep and breathy appreciation) as a &quot;designer.&quot;	2000-12-12

Historian James MacGregor Burns and Georgia Sorenson have written an interesting book about Bill Clinton's failed effort to be a success by becoming a &quot;centerist&quot; U.S. President.  Their excellent book, title DEAD CENTER: CLIINTON-GORE LEADERSHIP AND THE PERILS OF MODERATION(1999), is worth reading.<br />The authors contend, rightfully, I think, that Bill Clinton tried to please everybody, and ended up pleasing no-one (well, almost no-one).  Pulitzer prize winning historian James MacGregor Burns and his co-author Georgia Sorenson argue that the price of centrism is high. They state that in choosing a centrist strategy, Bill Clinton rejected the kind of leadership that might have placed hiim among the historic &quot;greats.&quot;<br />They review Clinton's presidency (which they imply was a failed presidency), and state that Clinton lacked creativity in fashioning new policies, the courage  to press for reforms and other changes despite popular apathy and opposition, the conviction to stick to grand principles no matter how long their realization might take (they imply Clinton was a notably mediocre President, and that he must really be grouped in the unprestigious ranks of Presidents who were fence sitters).<br />Most interestingly, Burns and Sorenson contend that Clinton (and by association, Albert Gore) was notable for his lack of commitment to the people to fight for their welfare at any personal cost. This is quite a charge considering that the main Gore Presidential candidacy battle cry was &quot;I will fight for you!&quot;<br />Burns/Sorenson review the disasterous faillure of Clinton's 1993-94 health bill and ascribe the failure of it to Clinton's centrism.  They remind readers that Clinton rejected the highly intelligent Canadian health plan model, which has been successful for decades in attaining a liberal good, universal health care.  Clinton tried to avoid alienating highly paid doctors and insurance companies.  The result was that his health plan had no particular idology, pleased nobody, really, and failed miserably.  The ironic thing was that Clinton's health bill was the most noble effort he made in his Presidency, which went downhill from that point.<br />Buy and read this excellent book.  It's a good read, and great discussion of how not to be a U.S. President.	2000-12-08

Jeffrey Rosen, author of THE UNWANTED GAZE (2000), went to Harvard College, Oxford U. (Balliol College....the book jacket doesn't say if he were a Rhodes Scholar like President Clinton was, but probably he was), and finally (again like President Clinton), Yale Law School.  Also, like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Rosen taught (still teaches) law school at Washington, D.C.'s  excellent and underrated Geroge Washington University.  Need we say more?  If EVER an overachiever walked the face of the planet, Mr. Rosen certainly fits the that description.  Beyond question, he is one smart dude!<br />His excellent book, THE UNWANTED GAZE (about privacy invasion by computers...and  evil people invading YOUR PRIVACY using computers), is worth buying from Amazon.Com and reading again and again.<br />This is easier said than done.   Simply possessing the book and finding a quiet place to read it doesn't deliver the information Rosen offers (worth having once gotten) easily.  His book is about an immensely complicated subject, and even though Rosen is a genious (really!) law professor, etc., etc., tackling his book ain't easy.  <br />The result is that, through no fault of his own (he's breaking very thick and important ice), his book is extremely difficult to read and digest.<br />Read it anyway. <br />You'll learn a lot about an important subject.<br />Here's what his book is about:<br />As thinking, writing, and gossip increasingly take place in cyberspace, the part of our life that can be monitored and searched has vastly expanded.  E-Mail, for instance (the most used and most famous form of cyberspace use), even after it is deleted, becomes a PERMANENT record that can be resurrected by employers or prosecutors (district attorneys, cops, the FBI, the CIA....you know....those guys, and for the past 30 years, those girls) at ANY point in the future.  Cyberspace doesn't give a damn about paper deterioration, etc.  Cyberspace is a WHOLE NEW media ball game with brand new rules! <br />On theInternet, EVERY website we visit, every store we browse in, every magazine we skim...AND the AMOUNT OF TIME we skim it...create electronic FOOTPRINTS that can be traced back to us, revealing detailed patterns about our tastes, preferences, and intimate thoughts (example...I visit public libraries very often and use library computers and Internet services....cops checking up on me who trace writings like the one you are now reading...composed in a Maryland public library...and see a pattern of public library use).<br />The brilliant Mr. Rosen (a smart lawyer you ought to hire if you get in trouble) explores the legal, technological, and cultural changes that have undermined our ability to control how much personal information about ourselves is communicated to others.  He proposes ways of reconstructing some of the zones of privacy that law and technology have been allowed to invade (computers, the Internet, etc. ALONE don't do evil things and victimize people without help....it takes bad guys and gals USING computers, the Internet, etc. to do us dirty and invade out privacy).<br />Poor gorgeous, big busted Monica Lewinsky, the Linda Lovelace of the Whitehouse, is the main example Mr. Rosen uses to illustrate his worthwhile point.  If Mr. Rosen is a comic book example of an overachiever (see above stated educational credentials if you doubt he is an overachiever),  Ms. Lewinsky is the comic book provider of oral sex to highly place politicians, certainly eclipsing Linda Lovelace and others you may have heard about.  She got famous for this, and thus is easy to relate to.<br />For this reason, perhaps, Mr. Rosen, uses her.  He does so brilliantly to show how legal types and nosy types got away with invading her privacy using computers and the Internet.  Ms. Lewinsky was not regarded sympathetically by the media, and perhaps for this reason, the VIOLATION of HER RIGHTS to privacy was ignored as a journalistic topic.  She was, in the male chauvinist mentality of the times, simply regarded as an appendage of the OTHER villain in the Clinton/Lewinsky story, Mr. Clinton, destined to become the most famous sex act President in U.S. history (it will be hard for future sex abuse Presidents to top his act).<br />Mr. Rosen plays the gentleman, and defends Ms. Lewinsky, especially her violated rights to privacy.  These rights were invaded when her computer use (to buy books, to write her diary, to send E-Mail communications, etc.) was used AGAINST her (in order to make Mr. Clinton look bad) in flagrant VIOLATION of her rights to free speech and privacy.<br />Mr. Rosen makes the dubious legal analysis that women seeking redress from sexual harrassment abuses, such as those suffered by Paula Jones and Anita Hill, should trash sexual harrassment charges and instead charge invasion of privacy.  This is one of the very few few weak parts of Rosen's book or thinking, but it is such spectacular balderdash that it is worth mentioning.<br />The author of THE UNWANTED GAZE (title taken from the &quot;Encyclopedia Talmudit,&quot; not to be confused with the Talmud) discusses Kenneth Starr's tapes and DoubleClick's (DoubleClick is the world's largest Internet advertising company at present....buy its stock if you want to get rich quick) on-line profiles (they probably have mine gotten from Amazon.Com and also from HotMail, both of whom successfully solicited &quot;profiles&quot; ,i.e. autobiographies, from me).<br />This smart Yale lawyer prepared by Oxford and Harvard REALLY covers the waterfront.  <br />The result is that readers like me get very scared of the Internet, and start returning to use of OTHER information sources nutty FBI loose cogs (like G. Gordon Liddy and J. Edgar Hoover) can't trace so easily.  For instance, NOW, when I want to communicate with one of my celebrity friends, I use the public library's copy of WHO'S WHO IN AMERICA.....their PRINT copy, NOT their on-line copy.  THAT WAY bad guys don't know who I'm sending nasty notes to, or nice notes, as the case may be.<br />Staying away from the Internet might be a healthy thing.  Personally, I don't plan to, but you might consider the idea.  You'll probably last longer than I will.	2000-12-06

He states that routine was an evil of the old capitalism, and that in recent times, the workplace was made &quot;flexible&quot; by means of the restructuring of time (flextime, part time jobs, increased use of swing and graveyard type shifts, etc.).  He then asserts that modern forms of labor are difficult to understand (he calls them &quot;illegible&quot;), and implies, persuasively, that the very murkiness of these new forms has enabled employers to victimize employees in new ways.<br />Author Sennett goes on to discuss the subject of risk, much ballyhooed and heavily sold as a good thing in recent times.  Sennett disagrees.  He states that risk-taking has become disorienting and depressing in today's world and workplace.  Sennett goes on to say that the work ethic has changed for the worse, and that workers have become enmired in inevitiable and depressing failure.  He describes the various ways workers caught in all this have tried unsuccessfully to cope with failure, and seems to be headed for a sad ending to his book.<br />However, the last chapter of THE CORROSION OF CHARACTER offers some hope. It is titled &quot;The Dangerous Pronoun,&quot; and in it, Richard Sennett explains why community is the best remedy for the ills of work people presently suffer on such a wide and unrelieved basis (despite all the politicians' claims of how wonderful everything at present because Wall Street and its stock market are doing very well).<br />This is a brilliant book.  Everybody should read it and encourage others to do the same.  Author Ralph Keyes of Yellow Springs, Ohio, wrote a similarly brilliant book in 1972 titled WE THE LONELY PEOPLE, also calling for more, not less, community in American life.  Keyes book made a big splash and started Keyes on a career as a big time author.  But his  book went out of print, and is now largely forgotten.  This is a shame.  It was Keyes' best book (and Keyes wrote many good ones thereafter).  <br />Richard Sennett has written a wonderful book about an important subject.  Only time will tell if people are intelligent enough to listen, and move appropriately to make the corrections he  calls for.	2000-12-03

James Billington, the present (2000) Librarian Of Congress, was well known as an expert on the subject of the Soviet Union and Russia prior to his 1989 appointment by President George Bush as head of &quot;the Nation's Library&quot; (as Billington likes to label LC). His 1970 book about the roots of Russian culture and cultural history should be on the bookshelf of any person who seeks to understand Russia. He wrote it during his days as a Harvard U. history professor and put a lot of work into it.  The result is a very thick (some would say huge) volume which discusses and presents the influences in Russian history, religion, and culture which have brought that country to the present age.<br />Billington is a comic book New England blue blood, like the U.S. President who appointed him Librarian Of Congress.  He is a direct descendant of the Mayflower Billingtons, was schooled at Princeton University and later at Oxford U. in England.  Many thought his Librarian Of Congress appointment might be a preliminary step to his becoming U.S. ambassador to Russia, but his boss, Mr. Bush, was not reelected in 1992, as expected, so Mr. Billington remained as LC chief for the following decade up to the present time.<br />Billington tells an interesting tale in his book about Russia.  The influences of Asia on the Moscow headquartered country barely located in Europe give the Russian cultural tradition an oriental caste difficult for western countries to understand and identify with.  Russia has always been a mysterious country to westerners, Mr. Billington informs us, and this has been a headache for Russian leaders.  Peter the Great made a point of bringing French culture to Russia, and trying to &quot;westernize&quot; the Moscow capital so western diplomats, whose help the Czar needed, wouldn't be scared off (or at least as scared off as before).  Peter The Great was partially successful, but the continuing Russian traditions and the eastern/Asian personality of these traditions didn't go away for Peter the Great or his successors, right down to the Communist Party leaders of post-1918 Russia and the U.S.S.R. The result, according to Billington, is that Russia always was and still is a &quot;wanna be&quot; western country.<br />James Billington relates a fascinating and brutal tale of an oriental country trying to become western for centuries, and mostly failing, stuck with the reality of its past. It is a tale of politics and poignance well worth buying and reading.  His book is now 30 years old, yet it stands as a classic all libraries and individuals interested in Russia should obtain and re-read often.	2000-11-25

He describes the preliminary period of the 1950's and before leading into the Sexual Revolution, and also describes the depressing reaction to the sexual revolution which led to very successful efforts in the 1980's and 1990's to stamp it out so it would never return again.<br />The only other book which can come close to matching Heidenry's tome is MAKE LOVE, NOT WAR (2000) by  Harvard scholar David Allyn (no relation to me).  Heidenry was a major player in the heady days when PLAYBOY imitators such as HUSTLER and PENTHOUSE (which employed Heidenry as an editor of the PENTHOUSE FORUM) were big publishing success stories.  Perhaps this is why one of the strongest offerings of his book are detailed accounts of the various sex enthusiast publishing efforts and empires, and description of such key movers and shakers as Hugh Hefner and Larry Flynt.<br />The war on the Sexual Revolution and its successful if unethical tactics are described by John Heidenry in detail, and are the best part of his very well written book.  Former Avco-Embassy Films publicist John Leo seems, according to Heidenry, to have single handedly invented the Herpes scare of the early 1980's, trumpeted forth from the pages of the secular publishing giant, TIME Magazine, and also from the pages of the Catholic Church affiliated COMMONWEAL.  Leo penned articles in the early 80's for both publications ballyhooing the Herpes scare as the worst disease to afflict humankind since the Black Plague of the the Middle Ages, and seems to have done it &quot;without a shread of epidemiological evidence.&quot;  Leo is labeled one of the &quot;principal anti-sex gurus,&quot; another of whom included George Leonard, the former West Coast Editor of LOOK Magazine.  Leonard had once suggested in LOOK that sexual intercourse could and would be shown on network television, but went on, in 1982, to renounce his advocacy of the Sexual Revolution in his book titled THE END OF SEX. According to author Heidenry, Leonard had a lot of company in the world of pro-sex turned anti-sex journalists.  The Sexual Revolution, he states, was largely assassinated by turn-coat media professionals.<br />Heidenry concludes that sexual activity continues in the world of human beings, even though the Sexual Revolution died. &quot;As survey after survey affirms, people are having the same amount of sex.  The human sex drive appears to be a constant factor in history.  Most kinds and amounts of sex people are having appears to be increasing, though some forms of high risk behavior such as one night stands and wife swapping (&quot;swinging&quot;) became, after the fall of the Sexual Revolution, highly unfashionable.&quot;<br />The Sexual Revolution was an important cultural event in American and world history.  Very little has been written about it recently, and John Heidenry's excellent book is a wonderful exception.  Every person who desires to understand the subject of sexual relations should obtain and read this book., but went on, in 1982, to renounce his advocacy of the Sexual Revolution in his book titled THE END OF SEX.

Elizabeth Haiken, a U. of Tennessee history professor, has written a great, and at times chilling book about what used to be commonly called &quot;plastic surgery,&quot; but which has come to be termed &quot;cosmetic surgery.&quot;<br />From the start (in the 19th century!), Cosmetic Surgery has always been controversial, and its practitioners accused of being quacks, often with justification.  More than 100 years ago (in 1892), Rochester, NY surgeon John Orlando Roe published reports about his work doing &quot;intranasal rhinoplasty&quot; (nose jobs), and his success at correcting the then widespread &quot;saddle nose&quot; deformity caused by syphilis.  Roe's idea was to build up the depression on noses of people afflicted by &quot;saddle nose&quot; problems, and thus help free them from the public stigma of having contracted a terrible venereal disease.  Roe's &quot;nose jobs&quot; were NOT done only to make people prettier. People with &quot;saddle noses&quot; were denied employment and rejected as marriage partners (even though their syphilis episode may have been over).<br />The politics of Cosmetic Surgery has been thick for a century.  Haiken relates the tale of breast enlargements done in the 1960's using techniques of silicone injections.  Such operations resulted in terrible tragedies, including amputated breasts.  When the special &quot;cosmetic silicone&quot; was withdrawn from the market by its suppliers, quack surgeons CONTINUED to offer the breast enlargement operation (made famous by Carol Doda, a San Francisco night club dancer) using industral silicone, even more dangerous than the withdrawn silicone.<br />Elizabeth Haiken's book is filled with fascinating graphic illustrations of cosmetic surgery examples and not a few &quot;quack display advertisements&quot; (including a current era ad offering penis enlargement and lengthening by Cosmetic Surgery International. The ad includes both an 800 phone number and an Internet Web Site address!). It alsoincludes detailed discussion and examples of various persons seeking to escape ethnic identity labeling, or at least accused of so doing by detractors.<br />Haiken has written a valuable and, for all its spectacular examples and gossipy talk, a surprisingly thoughtful and intelligent book.  She has combined worthwhile history professor scholarship with clear and fast paced writing style.  The result is a book worth buying and reading over and over again.	2000-11-25

Nussbaum, Jeremy Rabkin, Cass R. Sunstein, and Sheldon S. Wolin.<br />T.V superstar George Will provides a foreword and Todd Gitlin offers an afterward. The book essays discuss the impact of the 60's in the areas of gender roles, sexuality and the family, universities and education, and racial issues.<br />Most of the essayists are complainers about the sixties, but whether or not one agrees with them, one must admit they are skillful complainers, and perhaps more important, that the information they provide in the course of their arguements is valuable and memorable.  Regardless of one's viewpoint about the sixties, this book is worth buying and reading.<br />Essays by Harvard's Harvey C. Mansfield and the American Enterprise Institute's Walter Berns are especially well done.<br />Mansfield's &quot;Legacy Of The Late 60's&quot; essay breaks the period down into twelve catagories and delivers lively &quot;mini-essays&quot; roughly two pages long for each catagory. Topics covered include the sexual revolution, the Vietnam War, Feminism, the 60's Impact On The Family, Drugs and Crime, Environmentalism, Rock Music, Postmodern Literature and Film, the &quot;Underclass,&quot; Education, Affirmative Action, and Egalitarianism. Mansfield socks his ideas to us in only 24 pages, and covers a lot of ground very readable and provocative form.<br />Walter Berns discusses the impact of the 60's on Universities, and spends a major part of his essay detailing the crisis at Cornell University in New York.  He indicts key players part of that crisis, students, faculty, and administrators, and offers interesting and chilling postscript information about the later successful careers, decades later, of these players.<br />This book is worth buying and reading.

David Frum has written a brilliant and very readable/entertaining book about the decade which came after the famous 1960's.  Frum argues the 70's had an impact more important than that of the 60's.  He argues his case very well.<br />He states that the great changes of the era were not centered around flower bearing, bead wearing, shoeless hippies, or fellow travelers, but around more ordinary and far more numerous persons, typified by a &quot;47 year old machinist's wife from Dayton, Ohio who was hardly touched by the 60's,&quot; but whose life was turned, so Frum says, upside down in the 1970's.  In that decade, &quot;her husband dumped her, she discovered cappucino, her standard of living failed to rise for the first time in her adult life, and she cast her first Republican ballot.&quot;<br />According to Frum, revolutionary behavior often (usually) ascribed to the 60's, took place in ways far more extreme than was the case in the 60's.  The Sex Revolution, he says, is a case in point.  The 60's were actually pretty quiet, sexually, but in the 70's &quot;the great sex party...was on!&quot;  Many young women started sleeping with dozens of men at precisely the time when they (the young women) were recruited to the ranks of the new militant feminism which cranked into high gear in the early 70's.  Feminists like Germaine Greer championed promiscuity as a means to break women's &quot;doglike&quot; devotion to men.  A devotion still in place in the 60's before the 70's war between men and women began. As a result, the 70's became far sexier than the 60's.<br />Frum is a skilled writer, and his HOW WE GOT THERE book is real page turner.  60's enthusiasts should add it to their &quot;must get&quot; list.	2000-11-19

It provides wonderful insights into the way the Catholic Church digs in where it was rejected before, and builds a powerful foundation for future growth.<br />Prior to the 1776 Revolutionary War, the Catholic Church was literally outlawed in the then 13 British colonies of North America.  After the war was won by the revolutionaries, the Roman Church immediately took steps to set up a branch of its organization in the newly established USA.  Baltimore, Maryland was chosen as the headquarters site, and a former Jesuit priest from a prominent Maryland family was consecrated the first Catholic bishop in the USA.  The Catholic Church divides the world up into geographical areas called &quot;dioceses,&quot; or &quot;sees,&quot; for short.  Thus, the new (in 1787) Catholic diocese in the USA (in Baltimore) was (and is) the &quot;Premier See&quot; of the Roman Catholic Church in America.<br />This book, written by a Catholic Religious Brother named Thomas Spalding (a history professor from Spalding University in Kentucky), details the establishment and growth of the Premier See, the Catholic diocese (later archdiocese) headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland.<br />The book is well written, and very interesting.  Brother Spalding does not shrink from offering controversial material, even reports of criticism of various bishops and archbishops who led the Premier See in Baltimore over its 200 plus year history.<br />Any student of the Catholic Church, friend or foe, would do well to read this book. It tells the tale of a complicated and powerful religious organization in a very readable, informative way.	2000-11-19

The most famous Roman Catholics in America in the 1960's were two priests who were (still are) brothers: Philip and Daniel Berrigan, the former a priest member of the Society Of St. Joseph (commonly known as the &quot;Josephites,&quot; an order dedicated to serving the Black community), the latter a Jesuit.  SSJ and SJ respectively.<br />Starting in the 1960's, these two priests broke a lot of laws, and served a lot of time in various jails and prisons.  They became famous as objectors to the War In Vietnam, and later expanded their respective &quot;ministries of protest&quot; to other situations of social injustice, as they perceived it.<br />Murray Polner and Jim O'Grady have written a fascinating account of the Berrigan brothers worth buying and reading.  The Berrigan brothers became famous as two ninths of the &quot;Catonsville (Maryland, USA) Nine,&quot; a group of protesters who, on May 17, 1968, raided a suburban Baltimore (Maryland, USA) draft board office, took its files of eligible young men about to be drafted into military service and possible combat in the then on-going War In Viet-Nam, and burned the draft board's records in a nearby parking lot, using a home made form of napalm.  Only some of the records were removed and burned.  The records left behind were stained with blood the two priests helped to pour over those records as a symbolic protest about the work of the draft board in promoting the War.<br />That was only the start of the civil protest career of these two men.  In the same year (1968), they traveled to Hanoi (the same year Jane Fonda did.) In succeeding years and decades, they continued their dramatic forms of protest, and were often jailed and served hard time in tough prisons.  <br />The story of the Berrigan Brothers is one every enthusiast about the social revolution of the 1960's should read.  All Roman Catholics should read it, too, especially Josephites and Jesuits. These two priests put those two Catholic religious orders in the NEW YORK TIMES and in other prominent media many times, and in some ways no doubt determined the future of those orders, the Catholic Church (especially in the USA), and the USA itself.<br />Much has been written both about and by the Berrigan Brothers.  This 1997 book is an important addition to the important history of these important Catholic priests. Buy this book from Amazon.Com. Read it carefully.  You won't be sorry.	2000-11-18

Roger Kimball has written a wonderful and important book.  Please go out and buy ten copies of it now, one for you, and nine for your friends now over age 50 (the &quot;60's Generation&quot;). What's the big deal about THE LONG MARCH, and why is it the best book about the 60's yet written, you ask? I'll tell you. The main reason it is so good is that is a gateway book to many OTHER SPLENDID BOOKS about the sixties.  Kimball identifies these good books, about half recently published and half not-so-recently published, in his wonderful, user friendly end notes section. For sixties enthusiasts like me, this is a true cornucopea.  Thanks to THE LONG MARCH, I learned of many OTHER books on the subject of the sixties easily available in nearby libraries, bookstores, and from Amazon.Com.  I got and read a bunch of them. A notable example is the newly published book titled MAKE LOVE, NOT WAR (2000) by David Allyn (no relation to me) about the sexual revolution of the sixties.  That subject has not been covered at all in separate books until now. Thanks to THE LONG MARCH and author Roger Kimball, I learned of Allyn's book and read it (also reviewed it for Amazon.Com).  My 1,000 maximum is running out, so I can't enthuse using too many more words.  Let me close by urging all who read this review to get and read this book, and tell your sixties enthusiast friends to do the same.  You won't be sorry.	2000-11-11
