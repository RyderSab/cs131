In my opinion Fischer was not measured with the same tape that Kasparov used for his other predescesors.  I read the previous tomes that were generous in compliments and compassion for the previous world champions.  For instance, Alekhine's allegued Nazi views were just touched upon with an apologetical point of view (those were the times during war...)  Kasparov favoritism for Soviet chess players is also flagrant and makes a great effort to make Spassky look great when, of all former world champions, he was a swindler (and a great one.) that earned his   Botvinnik used the Soviet apparatus to promote his chess career and he didn't show great superiority over Bronstein whose father was declared \\"enemy of the state\\" (can anyone play knowing that there might be a retaliation against your family should you decide to steal the world chess championship?)  All in all, there is no balance in Kasparov's book and one can sense his animosity against Fischer in his writings.  Sure enough, previous world champions have shortcomings and great things but all of them should have been measured with the same measure of equanimity.  And, of course, computers will be able to detect flaws in games from the past but that doesn't demerit the greatness of former world champions.  I can only hope that Kasparov doesn't apply the same hateful attitude towards Karpov and be more balanced in his views. <br /> <br />Is the book worth owning? Yes it is.  The analyses are superb and Kasparov is a great anotator.  Can you overlook Kasparov's attitude towards Fischer? If so then buy the book...	2005-02-10

When I see a chess book that earns me points over the board for one reason or another, I considered that the book paid itself.  In this sense I was fortunate to capture some ideas for White against the Sicilian Sveshnikov and the Kalashnikov.  The games that Dr. Nunn present exemplify the right way to play against those openings and a starting point for more indeep study.  Basically, the opening ideas presented by Nunn are good and very well explained to the mass of mediocre chess players. <br /> <br />On top of everything Nunn provides an interesting treatise of middlegame themes ranging from combinations to strategy.  I believe that some of the material also serves in practical play (for instance, defensive play) and it should be reviewed carefully. <br /> <br />On a negative note Nunn doesn't even mention Chernev's name in the bibliography despite the fact that he virtually copied Chernev's format... <br /> <br />All in all a good lesson from a GM	2005-01-28

The players index also facilitates studying games from a particular master from the past.  I very much enjoy using this book because one of the advices that I received from a very strong player long time ago is that I must emulate a classical player and understand his game completely to incorporate his ideas on my game 9Simple enough, I copied the openings repertoire of a very strong player and literally studied all of his games.)

This book looks like a bad sequel of a good book by Aagaard called Excelling at Chess.  I go back to that book every now and then to review some points and to better understand conceptually chess.  The idea of excelling at positional chess is interesting but wasn't that covered alreay in the first book?  Other than the positional exercises (that you can craft for yourself by examining a middlegame position from a great game) I didn't find anything novel or worth reading in this book... Frankly, Aagaard he is becoming a Schiller by doing this type of book factory like production.  I was frankly saddened by his book on the Grunfeld and this book about excelling at positional chess... Poor quality books from a guy that created a good name for himself by publishing a very good book of chess: Excelling at Chess.

Once you get over the fact that the notation is descriptive you will be fine.  I don't mind reading books in descriptive notation and considering the content of the book this is just a minor inconvenience [Speaking of which, have you noticed how cheap are books in descriptive?]<br />Znosko-Borovsky is entertaining, engaging and profound.  The whole purpose of the book is to make you aware of the need to analyse the position both from the internal and the external points of view.  In other words:  How to make an inventory of who has the advantage in tempi, material, and space and how those factors compensate to determine which side has the advantage over the board.  As a consequence of this analysis the author shows how to make a plan and execute it over the board.  Sounds simple? It becomes simple after reading Znosko-Borovsky's book.  Why is it that few people write in this manner nowadays?  Why is it that authors can not be entertaining?<br />I read this book at least once every month and have given it to some friends to help them improve their chess.

Bronstein is an excellent writer that did more than to keep a record of a tournament with soul-less annotations and without realizing it compiled a book that shows how difficult is the game of chess when the level is high.  In these games we see more than a textbook exploitation of a good knight against a bad bishop or games where one of the players was highly cooperative with his/her counterpart allowing him/her to demonstrate a win by simple means.  What we see here are games where ideas in the opening clash and where important material in the middlegame is reviewed.  This book is a classic and it is by far one of the best games compilation in the market.  I strongly recommend playing solitaire with these games and enjoy the game of chess with it.	2004-07-01

Simple things like pins, weak back ranks, unprotected pieces and other themes plague a game of chess.  Being able to confidently spot these tactics, calculate, and execute them over the board is a must and to learn these abilities you have to practice.  This book is just a bunch of diagrams with a heading &quot;White to move&quot; and the theme written on the bottom of the page.  Your job is to spot the tactic and come up with the line of play.  Nowadays there are even files with these diagrams to practice with the computer so this little book can't be that bad...  I still use it to and enjoy solving the problems.

IM Watson did a lot of good for my opening and helped me to repair the lines against the Tarrasch variation, get over my irritation when facing the exchange variation, understand better how to outplay the advance variation and render inocuous the KIA.  That was the second edition...<br />On the third edition I found new material to update the previous book but instead of the main line in the Winawer he recomends castling instead of allowing White to grab the g-pawn...  What a waste!  Objectively speaking the line that Watson recommends in the third edition is as good but this chapter is not consistent with the deviations on the fourth and fifth move of the Winawer where in some of the lines White allows Black to grab the g7 pawn.  This in itself, with so much material to digest, should confuse the reader.  It is great to present new ideas and material to justify a third edition but, seriously, IM Watson should have kept the original frame of the repertoire.<br />In the Tarrasch almost everything changed and instead of the principled 3...Nf6 Watson works the 3...Be7 variation.  Honestly, I don't see a reason to even experiment with this move when White could very well steer the game towards dubious variations for Black and where the very principles of 3...Nf6 need to be used (Watson even shows such a possibility.)  Why not continue working on a system that is proven good and not try to come up with exotic ideas that are not principled and only have shock value?  <br />All in all the Tarrasch section with the 3...Be7 move makes me wonder if Watson sat down in front of the computer, opened chessbase and tried to come up with something totally different from the usual stuff.  After gathering these games he wrote some prose justifying the move and came up with a system against the Tarrasch... This single chapter shows how a database and some chess engine can make authors lazy.  I have purchased books that have left me disappointed because of the author's abuse of a database with statistics and engines to revive lines or come up with some contribution to theory.  The chapter on the 3...Be7 in the Tarrasch in Watson's book is regretably one of these very rare instances when I would like to burn a chess book.  Ah! And the difference in writing style and quality between the 3...Be7 chapter and 3...c5 + ...Qxd5 is glaring.  While the latter was written with care the previous was just sloppy.<br />The lines with the exchange variation, the KIA and the remaining material are about the same as the previous edition.  Is it worth getting this book?  I am afraid not... The second edition of Watson's &quot;Play the French&quot; showed more work and craft and I am happy with that book.  The third edition?  Sorry... It was just not as good as the previous...<br />I don't care if a book has blunders in the analyses.  I don't care if it has not been computer checked.  What I do care to see are explanations, ideas, lots of diagrams, reasoning behind moves, a personal touch in writing style and something I would not come up by staring at a computer screen by cranking up Fritz or chessbase.<br />If you can get the previous edition go for it.  The third edition is just not as good...	2004-06-30

This book emphasizes ideas and analysis.  It takes you to the point where the middlegame is about to start and provides you with a guiding light to select sound plans and strategies.  The book doesn't aim to become a complete treatise but to encourage the reader to think independently and understand what is happening during the game.  I liked the excellent selection of games on the back and the way the chapters are organized.  Almost each one of them covers very relevant material.  For instance, the excerpts about the Seville variation are very valuable and should be read by any serious player.  I believe that Khodarkovsky crafted a nice book here and I will keep on coming back to it to brush upon ideas and principles.	2004-02-26

He also gives good arguments of why some lines, that are quite fashionable, are not recomended by his.  This is good because I can see the author's point of view and not an attempt to avoid creative discussion.  In that sense my copy of &quot;Understanding the Grunfeld&quot; is full notes by me where I disagree with Mr. Rowson or where I think that there is an easier solution [I wonder if Mr. Rowson would appreciate my views on the opening and my objections...]  For instance, the chapter about 4.Bf4 (Hydra) has many, many pointers that will let you survive as Black.  However, in one of the variations, 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Bf4 Bg7 5.Rc1, he recomends 5...Nh4.  This is surprising since Rowson suggests that Rc1 by White signals Black to do dxc4 later in the book... Indeed 5...dxc4 is also acceptable according to Suetin.  Still, the whole Hydra chapter book made me think about the variation as whole and to come up with a repertoire that would keep me alive if ever challenged in this important chapter of the Grunfeld and I can only thank Mr. Rowson for a recent nice win even after disagreeing with him!  The Hydra chapter pays for the effort of buying the book.<br />The exchange variation is also covered in detail and I can only say that finally I understood the reasoning behind some obscure moves.  That chapter also pays for the effort of buying the book and it is, as far as I know, the best treatment of the exchange that I have ever seen.<br />I am not an expert in the Grunfeld but having scored 3 wins and a draw out of 4 games after deciding to switch to this opening made me fall in love with it...  Much of this is because of Mr. Rowson's book.<br />This is a book that I will read again and again and again...	2004-01-07

Pachman's book is very thorough and organized.  As a manual for the middlegame this book should be read after going through tactical training books like 1001 mates / combinations by Reinfeld, Polgar's brick, or any similar book with combinations.<br />Once the tactical training is finished, Pachman's book will aid you to develop the complex strategical aspect of the middlegame.<BR>Pachman's examples are very illustrative and going through the book twice provides good returns in OTB games.

So, here I am spoiling a game where I earned an advantage in the endgame because of poor technique... How frustrating!<br />I decided to solve this ridiculous problem by studying the endgame.  Having Basic Chess Endgames by Fine I started there. However, it was a drag... The explanations were lacking and the format of the book was so bad that it didn't invite me to study it.  In addition some of BCE's endings are incorrect (OK, I will be fair: R. Fine didn't have access to computer programs during his days to check the endings.)<br />Then I saw this black little book: &quot;Concise Chess Endings&quot; by GM McDonald.  Hmmmm!  At first I thought that this can't be a serious book and didn't think much of it until I opened it.  I decided to study it and think of it as a quick fix to my problems... Little did I know!<br />When I finished the first chapter about pawn endings I was like, why didn't somebody explained this to me before?  Then I read it again to work on my recently gained knowledge.  Then I started studying the rook endings chapter and learned how to draw (and win) a K+R+P vs. K+R ending... What was most amazing is that the knowledge was applied within a matter of two weeks because I had to salvage a draw in this very same ending!  Was this a coincidence or what?  I mean, after reading a couple of chapters of Concise Chess Endings I had the chance to apply the newly acquired knowledge over the board!<br />Surely, this book alone will not solve ALL your problems in the endgame but it is a refreshing start nonetheless!  After completing the whole book I decided that it was time to be serious about the endgame and decided to educate myself by reading other books:  BCE's by Fine deserved a chance and I decided to pursue it even further.  I decided also to buy Fundamental Chess Endings by Muller and Lamprecht and was very, very surprised with its quality...<br />Anyway, Concise Chess Endings (CCE) will provide you with a fair knowledge to tackle most commonly encountered endings in practice.  It will not solve all of your techinque problems but it will motivate you to pursue the study of endings in a more systematic way.<br />I still come back to CCE to brush upon my newly gained knowledge.  GM McDonald is by far one of the best chess writers around.  I own many of his books and have not been disappointed with his stuff.	2003-05-05

After all, the pawn squeleton determines how to proceed and how to place most optimaly your pieces.<br />This is precisely what GM N. McDonald does:  He categorizes the resulting pawn structures and proceeds to explain the typical themes that apply in each configuration of pawn structures.  His aim to arm you with practical knowledge is superbly accomplished.<br />However, you have got to have some previous knowledge of the French defense to get the most out of this book.  This is unavoidable in my opinion and your repertoire in the French has to be fine tuned before tackling GM McDonald's book [ That is, you must know what to do against a Tarrasch variation, how to handle the advance variation, etc. ]<br />GM McDonald is very candid in explaining what his aim is and clears up that his book is not about variations of the French defense but general plans for black (and white by default...) That is the reason why I gave him 5 stars.  After all, cramping the book with variations and subvariations defeats the purpose of GM McDonald's book and if that is what you are looking for, IM Watson's book &quot;Play the French&quot; is a much better choice [ I use both books for my preparation ]	2003-05-05

This book drills in this very matter testing your ability to recognize a pattern and to calculate the variations leading to checkmate.<br />I solved each and every puzzle in this book and I can honestly say that the skills gathered were put to the test almost inmediately: I was engineering simple checkmates and executing them over the board after reading the book.  <br />Objectively speaking the problems range of difficulty varies a lot. Some of the problems are as simple as calculating a mate in one while others require you to find a ten moves solution.  Is this good? Sure it is! A plain diagram with the words &quot;white (or black) to move&quot; not telling you how long is your path to victory is in my opinion the best way to train tactics. [In fact, I would say that Reinfeld should not even divide the material in themes like queen sacrifice, attack to the uncastled king, etc.]<br />A single pass over Reinfeld's problems is just not enough and the book demands a second or even third &quot;reading.&quot;  Why? Because it will save time and suffering in actual games...<br />In any case I wholeheartedly recommend this book	2003-04-11

Reuben Fine was a great player and almost reached the very top in chess.  However, when it comes to providing a study guide for the ending this is anything but basic.  The lack of explanations in some variations is just irritating!  I like to be challenged when reading a book and encouraged to think but the author is not teaching me but showing off!  <br />I believe that more diagrams could have been included to illustrate the points or at least, for the verbally oriented, a more thorough description of what is going on.  In this regard I want to give &quot;Fundamental Chess Endings&quot; by Muller et. al. an ovation.  For example:  The pawn endings chapter in Basic Chess Endings requires 287 diagrams in all [ I have added the positions described in the text but not depicted like:  &quot;White: King at KN8, Pawns at QB6 and KN2. Black: King at K1. White to move and draw&quot; ]  In Fundamental chess endings there are only 64 diagrams for the same chapter and I don't have to go through the aggravation of setting up the board for positions that are not diagramed!  And it is so much clearer...<br />Do yourself a favor and don't buy BCE's by Fine... It is a horrible book.<br />Ah! Many inaccuracies have been found in BCE's and some of them weren't caught with a chess computer!  When I was browsing through old issues of chess life I ran into a bunch... That leads me to regretfully believe that Fine didn't do his best and that his work in endings is very superficial.	2003-02-17

How wrong was I!  This book is fantastic!  The author did a great job commenting the positions and it is clear that he, himself, assessed the variations and offered a very balanced opinion.<br />I was very, very surprised with his thoroughness and the fact that the book is not merely a repository for a database.  Pedersen crafted this book with care and professionalism!<br />I, myself have gathered some ideas from it and what is interesting is that these ideas are applicable over the board...<br />I am happy I bought this book and hope to see a next one on the French by him.	2003-01-23
US	51114962	R49C9JOL52VT0	0805039066	270836736	Winning With the French (Openings)	Books	5	26	26	N	N	A must have for the serious French defense player	GM Uhlmann is certainly an acknowledged specialist in the French defense.  I for one decided to buy this book to deal with problematic variations as black (i.e., Tarrasch variation and KIA)  I found more than I could possibly hope to find in the book.  For one, this is not just an insuferable encyclopedic treatise bound to be outdated the minute you buy it.  It isn´t a pedantic presentation of lines with no logical sense but a concise and fun explanation of IDEAS commonly used in the French.  GM Uhlmann promises in his book to show you what´s typical and how to find your way out from unknown situations over the board and gives you an arsenal of weapons to enrich your French defense.<br />The book´s format is simple: Anotated games by Uhlmann full of comments, variations, ideas, and opinions.  I found it interesting to see that GM Uhlmann shows a remarkable objectivity when mistakes by him appear on the games.  With utmost professionalism he warns about his mistakes, suggests an alternative approach, and implicitly tells you how to fine tune the opening.  I have applied many of the ideas presented on this book and can say that I feel more confident each time I play the French.  GM Uhlmann makes you fall in love with the French by exposing the ideas behind each variation and how to thrive when facing unknown situations.<br />I must forewarn anyone reading this review that the book is very specific in the variations covered: Tarrasch closed and open (with an isolated queen pawn), Winnawer, Advance, KIA and exchange.  Do not expect to see the classical variation among the lines covered or any other non-fashionable lines.  GM Uhlmann has worked the above repertoire of the French defense and since those lines are his specialty you will learn them thoroughly with him.<br />In regards to negative aspects of the book I can say that I would like to see a more thorough discussion about the pawn structures that result commonly and how to play the resulting endings.  This isof course very subjective and it is just my opinion on how to deal with the study of chess openings.  In spite of that, I believe that discussing pawn structures resulting in the French would make the book just perfect. However, I am giving the book 5 stars because it delivers what it promises to the reader.	2003-01-06

This is a book of chess that has good things to think about but it is not all-encompassing. When I started reading the book I saw an essay trying to prove John Watson's points were wrong and that's fine... But I haven't read Watson's book and it is very difficult to weigh the arguments... Instead, I would have preferred for the author to present his points of view on the dynamic nature of rules of chess (if those rules do exist...) and defend his point of view accordingly. The debate with Watson made the points that the author wanted to emphasize obscure... However, I rejoyced in gathering the good of the chapter and obtained good pointers...<br />The strongest point of the book though is the presentation of Anderssons's games and the way he plays endings. That in itself paid for the book! I am not into endings but after reading the chapter in this book I started liking them... ergo, I improved...<br />All in all, the book is fine and has a place in the personal library. However, it could have been written better for the benefit of the readers...	2002-11-05

When I asked him what books should I study to improve my chess he mentioned Logical Chess Move by Move by Chernev and the elusive but excellent chess tomes by Roberto Grau from Argentina (very popular in Latin America). <br />Neither were available or out of print. I finally found Chernev's book and it is more than what I would have expected. Forget for a moment that the opening systems are outdated and that the games are old and instead think about the intent of the book: How to think logically. After reading this book I started seeing more clearly variations that eluded me and were there for me to use. I have been able to develop a more aggressive chess and to enjoy it even more. <br />I am sure that I am hopeless and that no book is going to make me a GM but still, as a chess addict, I cherish the opportunity to read good chess books and to apply what I have learned on the board. As for people like my neighbor that bought this book just to be able to beat me once, I am sorry... It just aint gonna happen :-)	2002-08-21

Ergo, it is useless...  Instead, it is a book about the culture that Linux created &lt;PERIOD&gt;  I found that substance is lacking and that the information it offers is nothing that you can gather and experience by surfing the web.  <br />Oh! The authors were just trying to be funny? Sorry, the book just wasn't...  Instead, it just seems a bunch of crammed material with no continuity from chapter to chapter and no purpose.  I am afraid that cartoons and highlighted quotes from the book do not help to make the book funnier... <br />I don't recommend reading this book if you are trying to use and learn Linux.  Instead, read the Red Hat Linux 7.2 Bible (If that's your distribution...) and you will learn relevant information for using Linux. To get in touch with what the &quot;Linux culture&quot; is about just surf the web.  Really, I found that by visiting linux related webpages, after doing a search with yahoo or any other engine, and joining the Local User Group for Linux in your area is more than enough.	2002-08-07

Y ahi es donde ya empezamos mal... Mas aun, siguiendo esa linea de razonamiento (que viene desde la iglesia catolica o el comunismo...), se sataniza a quien aun por fruto de su trabajo duro y honesto acumula riquezas para su beneficio.  Es asi como surgen pseudoideologias politicas en las cuales se sugiere abiertamente que se le debe quitar al rico para darle al pobre mediante &quot;programas sociales.&quot;  Lo malo es que esos programas no funcionan y eventualmente se forma una cultura de la violencia donde el robar y el mendigar se justifican porque el gobierno no hace nada y los ricos son unos hijos de puta.<br />La radiografia de latinoamerica es definitivamente implacable y certera.  Lo mismo se puede decir de la critica que ellos hacen de Eduardo Galeano.  Sin embargo, no dejan estos autores una luz, aunque sea tenua, de esperanza para Latinoamerica.  Despues de terminar el texto senti cierta sensacion de derrota que no me pude quitar (y eso que vivo en el pais de los gringos...)<br />Cuestionar los supuestos es importante para moverse hacia el futuro.

Lo que da grima es que se pretenda poner a semejante esperpento en la misma categoria de grandes escritores Peruanos de mas trascendencia y de mayor profundidad.  Bayly carece de sustancia, es un pobre idiota que busca ridiculizar a la sociedad para sentirse bien consigo y que no aporta nada de trascendencia.  Despues de leer este libro yo me pregunte que habia quedado de su lectura y si yo lo volveria a leer.  Dolorosamente, las respuestas a estas preguntas fueron negativas y despues de darle el beneficio de la duda a este panfleto me di cuenta de que Bayly no tiene nada que contar.  La gente vera si le sigue el juego a Bayly... Yo por mi parte tuve mas que suficiente con esta porqueria de libro... Y no...

Cliff's unpretentious writing style, and the way he unveils the story keeping you interested is just awesome. I bought this book while flying from Columbia, SC to Oklahoma City, OK and couldn't stop reading the whole trip and while waiting for the connections.

I used his techniques to land interviews and a nice job with a fantastic company.  The best thing about the book is that it provides tools to perfect your delivery and obtain results by marketing yourself effectively.  Not only does it emphasize on what to say but how to say it.

It was a great way to become addicted to chess...  That's why I am giving it four stars instead of three.<br />However, the book tends to be dogmatic in its openings theory chapters and also to dismiss lines that are actualy pretty solid.  After reading the book one ends up with the impression that having the bishop pair is almost a ticket to a win.  Nonsense, each position has to be addressed individually.  The endings chapter is good for beginners but non-challenging.  Middle game plans are analyzed from a tactical point of view in most cases neglecting value to strategic considerations.  <br />This book is good as an approximation to chess but, as a word of advice, do read more advanced tomes and practice.  I have seen that testing ideas on the board is a way to see if you are progressing or not.	2000-11-05
