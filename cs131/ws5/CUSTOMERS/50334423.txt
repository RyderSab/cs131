I don't know anyone who wouldn't find this book hilarious. By thetime I was finished I was laughing so hard, tears were running down myface.

I find it rather interesting that Mrs. Cheney penned this book in light of her husband's heart disease. And then, Dick suffers another heart attack at the age of 59, just like the character. Are darker forces at play?<br />In all seriousness, this book doesn't deserve all the hype it is getting. It is not a bad book, but it is also not all that good either. It tries to be funny without really accomplishing it. For true, classic political satire try Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita. That book is so much above Lynne Cheney's book that I would cringe to even make a comparison.	2000-12-02

An exploration of the complex relationship between three very different but equally lost individuals  is an excellent basis for a novel and that is why this book should have been much better than it was.  Although admittedly the focus of the book was the conflicts between and relationships of the three main characters, I still found that the book followed no clear plot. As I was reading, I often found myself wondering just where the story was going. Characters seemed to just go through the motions of life with the story leading up to anything. <br />The author also dropped tantalizing mysteries, only to never revisit the subject again. We never did find out Simon's true origins, despite much discussion about it early in the book, nor was the reasons behind Kerewin's estrangement from her family revealed. Filling in some of these gaps could have greatly added to the depth of the characters and given readers much more insight into their feelings and motivations. <br />Finally, I am skeptical as the whether the characters in this book offer an accurate and true representation of the Maori culture. I would caution against anyone stereotyping an entire ethnic group based on this book. <br />While I applaud the author for tackling serious subjects, I found that the obvious lack of a plot and story question made this book a very unsatisfying read.	2000-11-25

Bush	Books	5	19	24	N	N	Portrait of an Ineffective Leader	Fascinated by the recent chaos of the U.S. presidential election, I picked up this book to gain some insight about one of the two major players in the drama. I began reading with no pre-conceived notions or opinions. After completing this excellent biography, I now have a much clearer picture of &quot;Dubya&quot;. <br />Beginning with his brief &quot;military&quot; stint, Ivins also covers his less than stellar corporate career and his political endeavors. In a completely non-partisan way, she chronicles how George W. is too often a weak, indecisive leader who is too easily influenced by corporate America, the Republican party and his father's circle of advisors. His main motivation for seeking the presidency (revenge for his father's 1992 defeat) is disturbing. The U.S.'s highest elected office is not a prize awarded at the end of a game and it should not be viewed as such. Politics and public service is a noble calling, but unfortunately there will always be people like Dubya who view it as a power play. <br />Whether you love, hate or have no opinion on George W., this book will provide some fascinating reading material.	2000-11-25

The troupe's reception is lukewarm, but pert and pithy-tongued Nicola attracts the attention of the queen, Mary, also known as Mary, Queen of Scots. A teenager herself, the queen engages Nicola as a jester.<br />At first, Nicola feels relieved. But she is soon weary of traveling from palace to palace, frightened when suddenly thrust into political tumult, and repulsed by the terrible punishment exacted on the rebellious. Then Francis II dies, and Mary, no longer Queen of France, leaves for Scotland's throne. Although apprehensive, Nicola is now devoted to her queen, and she musters up her courage to go along.<br />In Scotland, Nicola finds that Mary is less inclined to listen to her counsel when it doesn't suit her, as when she accepts Lord Henry Darnley's suit for marriage. Nicola mistrusts and despises the man but cannot make her beloved queen listen to her. Around this time she also befriends the ill-fated David Riccio, Mary's new music master and, eventually, her trusted secretary and adviser.<br />The events then unfold steadily; Darnley's death, Mary's subsequent marriage to Bothwell, her imprisonment at Lochleven and escape, all leading toward the doomed queen's final departure to England. Nicola is there for most of it, lending a personal perspective to the historical portrait.<br />This is a highly interesting, if not always factually, book and certainly provides a different look at a historical event.	2000-10-29

In the novel, Nick Carraway tells the story of his neighbor Jay Gatsby, a handsome bachelor who has amassed a fortune as a racketeer in order to build a Long Island mansion and give fabulous parties that he hopes will enable him to win back the love of the married Daisy Buchanan.<br />This book is a story of the American dream and Fitzgerald's basic belief that the dream has been degraded and corrupted until it almost seems to be foolish to aspire to that dream because it would just make one morally derelict. The lower orders that aspire to infinite and instant wealth are trying to adopt the values and standards of the established rich class, which are already corrupt. Fitzgerald felt that American idealism had been corrupted by embracing materialism as its means. Fitzgerald believed that we are in a vicious circle, that the established wealth is corrupt but the new rich adopt to the same ideals as the old rich and they become corrupt and join the established wealth and then the new group aspires to the established rich values and so on.<br />A strong statement of the author's personal values and beliefs, it is also a highly entertaining read.	2000-10-18

Discovering this universal wonderment lies at the foundation of the author's main theme, highlighted brilliantly through his distorted and domineering society. <br />With this futuristic society and a distortion of trends found in today's culture, Bradbury captures his reader's attention and makes them open their eyes, hearts, and mind to the true importance of independent intellectual enhancement through reading.	2000-10-18

In coping with her grief, she retreats to a world which she seems to have created, a 15th-century seaside village. Her presence in this world is neither welcomed nor rejected; it is simply acknowledged. She moves among the characters like a ghostly witness, observing and recording events.<br />Her sojourn among these people begins with the discovery of a mermaid washed ashore; the young fisherman who finds it is eventually driven to taking his boat out beyond safe waters. A leper passes through the village, leaving behind a guidebook for the Holy Land. He gives it to Sally, a young mother and wife to the fisherman. Later, he returns to lead a handful of villages and the narrator on another pilgrimage, at the end of which the narrator is ready to face her future.<br />The narrative is dreamlike and hazy, with the fragmented continuity and shifting perspectives of a dream. At times, the narrator disappears entirely into a third-person voice. There is a recurring image of something washed ashore and the repetition reinforces the dreamy quality of the text.<br />The characters are more like emblems (the priest, the shoemaker's wife, the red-haired girl) and only two or three are actually given names. They seem to represent aspects of the narrator's personality, particularly the leper who is trying to expiate a loss. These characters are dismissed or drop away until only the leper and the narrator remain.<br />The abstract quality of the writing may frustrate readers who prefer a more concrete plot and characters and at times, the book verges on the deliberately obscure. But readers looking for something different would do well to try this book.	2000-10-18

Living as the servant and confidante to a prince during the time when the Black Death was wiping out Europe, the dwarf experiences many instances in which he must commit wicked crimes for the Prince. He does so willingly, considering his lack of conscience. Ultimately, these crimes force him into eternal imprisonment in the dungeon under the fortress, where he can only write daily recordings of his empty life during the hours when the sun shines through the cracks, and hope to be called upon again by the Prince. <br />The thoughts and emotions of the dwarf are both shocking and thought provoking. His hatred for himself, his own kind and humanity provide insights into the true motivations of society and many of its flaws. <br />This book is highly unique and I recommend it to anyone seeking a deep and meaningful book.	2000-10-18

There are no clues, however, as to when that time will be.<br />This novel provides a possible answer. In it, Arthur does return to war-torn England during World War II. It's not a rebirth or reincarnation, nor has he lain sleeping all these years on some misty isle. Rather, Arthur has been sent through time by Merlin's magic to pursue Mordred and the stolen Excalibur. <br />Arthur, as always, is a warrior through and through. But instead of swords and axes, the battles are fought with Spitfires and Hurricanes, Stukas and Messerschmitts. And while some myths tell us that Merlin once turned Arthur into a hawk, in this novel Arthur is turned into a pilot.<br />The author has even provided Arthur with Bill Cooper, a Connecticut Yankee to round out his court. And, while he does stretch a bit sometimes to make amusing Arthur-related puns and anachronistic misunderstandings, it's still an enjoyable read. At the same time, Anderson drives home the deadly seriousness of the Battle of Britain with death and sacrifice everywhere and the grim hope and stubborn resolve which truly made it England's finest hour. The repeated attacks on London, the devastating blitz on Coventry, it's all there in shocking detail.<br />This is a good book for Arthur enthusiasts because it takes the heroic figure out of his element and introduces him into a new one. World War II buffs will also like it for the gritty realism of the outnumbered RAF and the ceaseless air war over Britain. I recommend it highly.	2000-10-16

James has no recollection of what has transpired in the intervening two months, but his letters eventually reveal a need for secrecy and subterfuge. Meanwhile, Kitty, James' stepsister and Richard's lover, is in correspondence with another, more distant cousin, Susan Voight, who is determined to track down the events leading up to James' drowning. When she finds him very much alive, she enlists herself in his cause.<br />Using letters and journal from James, Kitty, Susan and Richard, as well as &quot;articles&quot; from the London Times, the authors create a taut and gripping plot packed with intrigue, secret societies, gun running, social movements, murder and more.<br />With its rich, complicated plot and complex characters, this is a book to try to savor, but don't be surprised if you can't put it down.	2000-10-16

Rather, it is a beautifully illustrated and exquisitely written story of ancient Japan involving magic, love, sacrifices and, of course, dreams. Taken from an ancient myth, this magical retelling is both a Sandman story and a freestanding work all its own, without needing reference or background in the Sandman universe.<br />The story begins, as many do, with a wager. A badger and a fox wager that whoever can drive a pious young monk from his temple will have the temple for a home. Despite their efforts, the monk is not fooled, and eventually the wager is called off. The fox goes to the monk and apologizes, an unprecedented move for the fox. The monk is accepting, and the two become good friends.<br />The fox then learns of danger to her new friend and is determined to save him from almost certain death. Indeed, she travels to far inner spaces, and manages to save the monk from the subtle spell that has been cast upon him. However, the monk is as stubborn as the fox and his own efforts to save her are as just as strong. He travels to the dreamlands in order to bargain for her life, and is beset by dangers of all sorts, without losing his resolve. The ending is unexpected, bittersweet and revealing all at once.<br />A magical and emotionally moving story, this is one book not to be missed.	2000-10-16

As she arrives at her new post, she feels uneasy even though all seems well and the future looks bright. Despite attempts at optimism, the presence of evil continues until the governess begins to experience regular and terrifying sightings. The horror rapidly grows when the reason behind these visitations is realized. <br />Although this book is short, its impact is nevertheless profound. The story's setting is surrealistic, leaving many factors open to speculation and debate. The end is at the same time chilling and mysterious. The enigmatic nature of the story adds to the mystery and terror and this book is sure not to disappoint any reader looking for a haunting and unforgettable story.	2000-10-16

This is the life of Steve Jobs and this book does a wonderful job of chronicling it. Love him, hate him or be somewhere in between, Jobs is a fascinating man who has led, and continues to lead a turbulent and spectacular life. Through the numerous interviews the author has presented to us how Jobs' peers view him.

Arguments for and against both the traditional 15th century dating and the newer 13th century dating are given. Some of the wilder theories are also discussed, from Velikovsky's catastrophism to attempts to date the Conquest to the end of the Early Bronze I period (c. 2300 BC). The final conclusion is that the bulk of the Exodus and Conquest narratives can not be historical. <br />As a readable introduction to the history and archaeology of Israelite origins, with a lot of background information on Egypt and Palestine in the second half of the 2nd millenium BC, this work is recommended to anyone interested in near-Eastern ancient history or Old Testament biblical studies.	2000-10-06

She continued as a stewardess through the glory days when a transatlantic ship crossing was as much a society event as a mode of transportation. She retired at age 63 in 1950, long after traveling by ship had ceased to be chic. During her career Violet Jessop lived through three ocean disasters: <br />1. the September 1911 collision of HMS Hawke with Olympic, <br />2. the sinking of Titanic in 1912, and <br />3. the sinking of the hospital ship Britannic during World War I. <br />But the reader who picks up this book expecting a gripping first-person account of the sinking of Titanic will be disappointed. Jessop treats that experience in a mere two or three pages. She dismisses the sinking of Britannic in a couple of pages and doesn't even mention the collision between Hawke and Olympic. <br />From our current historical perspective, it's easy to judge that the most important event in Violet Jessop's life was her presence on board Titanic. But for Violet the best part of her life was her early childhood, before her father's death, in South America. Her book tells in lovingly remembered detail of her days on the Pampas before her father's illness and early death sent the family back to England and into financial need. Violet went into service on a ship not because of the glamour of the work, but because it was a job that required little education. <br />Violet, who lived from 1887 to 1971, completed this manuscript in 1934, probably for some contest that she apparently did not win. Her nieces discovered the manuscript after her death and submitted it to Sheridan House for publication in 1996. <br />This woman who is the subject of this book should not be judged for when and where she happened to be in history, but the kind of life she led.	2000-10-06

It begins with a very brief introduction to different number systems and beliefs about numbers, covering the Pythagoreans, gnosticism, the Cabala, Islamic mysticism, medieval numerology and numerical puzzles. The bulk of the book is a kind of encyclopedia of numbers: each of the numbers up to 21 gets its own chapter; after that they are dealt with &quot;en masse&quot;. <br />Each chapter is an unordered and unstructured compilation of beliefs about the subject number, mostly drawn from Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Unfortunately, there is no attempt at cross-cultural comparative analysis or at relating beliefs about numbers to other symbolic systems. <br />This book might better serve as a reference rather than a complete read.

A dozen chapters (written by separate specialists) each describe a different &quot;kind&quot; of Roman: citizens, priests, jurists, soldiers, slaves, freedmen, peasants, craftsmen, merchants, the poor and bandits, with a final chapter on the distinction between Romans and non-Romans. The geographical, temporal and social variation even within these categories is stressed.                      However, one startling omission from The Romans is any discussion of womens' roles: while women are mentioned in several places, there is nothing specifically on topics such as prostitution, marriage or motherhood.) <br />The chapters do not assume a particular theoretical background, but their focus is anthropological rather than historical. Though literary sources are used (along with epigraphic and archaeological ones), the authors try their best to escape the dominance of literary stereotypes, both contemporary and modern.  The reader will enjoy the book to the fullest if he already has some knowledge of Roman history, however this is not required. <br />It's been a long time since I learned as much about ancient Rome as I did from this book, and I recommend it to anyone who wants an introduction to recent work on the subject.	2000-10-05

This offering gives a bit more balance to the series and has a better claim to be the &quot;Penguin Atlas of Human History&quot; since it begins with maps of the oldest known hominid fossil finds. As with the other books in the series, the maps are very well laid out and will be irresistible to history buffs like myself. The emphasis is definitely on political history, but there are a few maps of population densities and trade routes. <br />The text that accompanies the maps is not bad, but is definitely not up to the same standard. Some of the information is even a little dubious (especially in the discussion of human evolution). There is also a tendency to see things from a European point of view, and I would have preferred a little less on the &quot;exploration&quot; of the continent and a little more on cultural history. <br />The Penguin Atlas of African History is a reference work that should be on everyone's shelves, but it should probably be backed up with a more detailed history of the continent.	2000-10-05

He was the next to last competitor to leave, just before the deadline. His boat, the Teignmouth Electron, was a trimaran. <br />He sailed at a disappointingly slow speed for a while and then reported a few amazingly fast days. Radio communications halted as he approached the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa, and nothing was heard from him for 111 days. <br />Then radio communications resumed as he re-entered the South Atlantic, around Cape Horn, at the southern tip of South America. He was leading the race, and seemed assured of the trophy and the cash prize of £5,000. Then, on July 10, 1969, his boat was found drifting in the Atlantic, with no sign of Crowhurst on board.<br />This book is the sad detective story of this voyage. Crowhurst never left the Atlantic Ocean, let alone sail around the world. He left massive documentation which showed that he had cheated. Presumably, rather than complete his fraudulent voyage, he stepped into the ocean and left the evidence for people to examine.<br />Although these facts are known prior to even picking up the book, the author still comes to a very surprising conclusion. This is a book about what was going on in the mind of this sad man who seems to have gone mad. It is a fascinating and worthwhile read.	2000-10-04

Its themes of duty, honor, man against nature and the glory of combat in the service of God are ancient but, despite the passage of 1300 years since its creation, the words of the poem still exert a powerful influence today. <br />While the text of some previous translations has been awkward and stiff, this edition is smooth and polished. It transmits the power and emotion of the poem without resorting to overly passionate passages.  <br />This is the very best way to enjoy an ancient masterpiece which should never be forgotten.	2000-10-01

That is certainly the conventional story. But, there are problems with that version, as there are problems with all of the alternative theories examined in this fascinating book. William Shakespeare was an actor and the owner of a theater. The only thing that connects him to his plays is his name at the top of them, which is fairly strong evidence.<br />This book examines the many alternate theories. Possible identities  of the true authors include Francis Bacon, Edward de Vere (Earl of Oxford, William Stanley (Earl of Derby), Roger Manners (Earl of Rutland and Christopher Marlowe. <br />The theory behind the possibility that Shakespeare stole other's works has problems. But this theory also has surprising evidence in its favor. <br />Most likely it is a mystery never to be solved. But it certainly makes for a good armchair debate.	2000-09-30

Abscam was a FBI sting operation in which Abdul, a fictitious, wealthy Arab sheik sought to achieve several things: asylum in the U.S., investment opportunities in the U.S. and help in getting his own money out of his own country. <br />FBI agents posing as associates of Abdul approached politicians for &quot;help&quot; in achieving Abdul's goals. What follows is a tale of deceit, corruption and lies as politicians responded positively to Abdul's offers of big money. The FBI's sting operation brought out many crooks and resulted in bribery and conspiracy charges. However, Abscam also raised many questions as to the FBI's entrapment tactics, even resulting in one conviction being overturned. <br />While shocking and disturbing, the story is nevertheless at times amusing. The end result is a comprehensive review of one of the biggest scandal's in U.S. history.	2000-09-30

The results of his research was suppressed at the time, as Holmes was not really dead. The research was only recently rediscovered. <br />From this excellent premise, the author has built a relatively good, but tragic story. Young Mycroft Holmes is a particularly strong and interesting character. <br />One of my complaints is the poor usage of Victorian English. It makes for difficult reading and I personally found its usage unnecessary. <br />It certainly cannot hold a candle to the original Holmes stories and devoted fans might be disappointed, but I still recommend this book to anyone interested in variations of Holmes stories.	2000-09-30

He is credited with the predictions of the death of Henry II, the invention of the hot-air balloon, the Great Fire of London, the flight and capture of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, the execution of Charles I of England, Napoleon Bonaparte and the imprisonment of the Popes, the rise of Adolf Hitler and the life and death of Elizabeth I, among other things. <br />The author has done a enormous amount of research, viewing and translating of the original editions of the prophecies. His research is by far more extensive than any ever done by Nostradamus believers.<br />The author has sorted out fraudulent editions of Nostradamus' writings with changes and predictions added long after his death. He has also uncovered many errors in various books regarding Nostradamus and his visions of the future. <br />In this book, we see that Nostradamus' prophecies were normally so cleverly vague (in the spirit of most prophecies, through all of history) that almost any event could be said to have been predicted by him. Some of his more specific prophecies were actually done after the predicted event, or else never came true. Several famous prophecies were modified, or made up, by other people, long after Nostradamus had died. <br />This book should be read by Nostradamus believers and skeptics alike.	2000-09-30

This delightful book tells the stories of some of these islands. These island discussed in this book are:<br />1.The Isle Of Demons, upon which Marguerite de la Roche spent over two years before being rescued. <br />2.Frisland, a large island with a king and numerous towns, sometimes south of Iceland, sometimes south of Greenland, sometimes in between. <br />3.Buss Island, sometimes small, sometimes large, east or west of Frisland. <br />4.Antillia, the Isle of Seven Cities, just West of Spain. <br />5.Hy-Brazil, circular with a river through it, just West of Ireland. <br />There are two chapters regarding two religious stories which were related to islands. One of them is the voyage of Saint Brendan, a story which inspired some to identify the islands as locations of miraculous occurrences.<br />Part history, part fairy tale, it is very entertaining reading of islands which, in fact, never even existed but were listed on maps for hundreds of years.	2000-09-29

Until very recently, it was widely believed that he died of stomach cancer, which was prevalent in his family.   <br />This book investigates the case made by Swedish dentist Dr. Sten Forshufvud. After learning the details of Napoleon's final days, Dr. Forshufvud began to suspect arsenic poisoning. Along with Ben Weider, the two delved into sources of available information regarding Napoleon, his imprisonment and those close to him. The authors present a very likely scenario of what really happened based on results of this investigation, along with an analysis of Napoleon's hair confirming arsenic poisoning. <br />Despite the hair analysis, the case is not completely solved, as Napoleon's final moments on his death bed did not indicate arsenic poisoning. Instead, the authors argue that arsenic was used to make Napoleon ill and then another method was used to finish him off. A likely suspect to the murder as well as a motive are also named. <br />This is a fascinating book for anyone interested in European history during a turbulent time.	2000-09-29

In the novel, Nick Carraway tells the  story of his neighbor Jay Gatsby, a handsome bachelor who has amassed a  fortune as a racketeer in order to build a Long Island mansion and give  fabulous parties that he hopes will enable him to win back the love of the  married Daisy Buchanan. <br />This book is a story of the American dream and  Fitzgerald's basic belief that the dream has been degraded and corrupted  until it almost seems to be foolish to aspire to that dream because it  would just make one morally derelict. The lower orders that aspire to  infinite and instant wealth are trying to adopt the values and standards of  the established rich class, which are already corrupt. Fitzgerald felt that  American idealism had been corrupted by embracing materialism as its means.  Fitzgerald believed that we are in a vicious circle, that the established  wealth is corrupt but the new rich adopt to the same ideals as the old rich  and they become corrupt and join the established wealth and then the new  group aspires to the established rich values and so on. <br />A strong  statement of the author's personal values and beliefs, it is also a highly  entertaining read.	2000-09-18

Living as the servant and  confidante to a prince during the time when the Black Death was wiping out  Europe, the dwarf experiences many instances in which he must commit wicked  crimes for the Prince. He does so willingly, considering his lack of  conscience. Ultimately, these crimes force him into eternal imprisonment in  the dungeon under the fortress, where he can only write daily recordings of  his empty life during the hours when the sun shines through the cracks, and  hope to be called upon again by the Prince. <br />The thoughts and emotions of  the dwarf are both shocking and thought provoking.

With the arrival of Gog, the City's atmosphere begins to change as if  it has been given a second chance at glory. At the same time, Gog and Duke  Gonzaga strike up an unlikely friendship. These events, however, are short  lived and the events of the book take on a much more sinister tone.<br />The  basic plot sounds very intriguing, but I was sorely disappointed by the  time I finished the book. The plot is often confusing and the events the  reader is writing about often seem to bear no relation at all to the book.

It was Franz Ferdinand's assassination in  Sarajevo by a Serb that gave Austria an excuse to declare war on Serbia,  thus beginning World War I. <br />Through this, readers can see the enormous  historical impact of the events at Mayerling. These events are chronicled  in this book in a clear and objective manner. Highly recommended.	2000-09-04

Although many other detective stories are also excellent, there  is nothing quite like the original Holmes stories. As we read through the  many adventures of Holmes and his ever faithful companion Dr. Watson, we  are also led through their colorful, albeit enigmatic, lives including Dr.  Watson's two marriages and the time in between them (lodging at 221B Baker  Street, naturally). Holmes' life includes his opium addiction, and  subsequent recovery, his encounter with Irene Adler and finally, his  retirement to the English Channel coast as a beekeeper.  <br />Whether already  a fan for years or a new Holmes reader, this collection is perfect. My copy  is one of the most treasured volumes in my library.	2000-08-31

What normally would be an unremarkable moment  has deep meaning for Julia, as this child resembles Kate, Julia's deceased  daughter. Kate's death has never ceased to haunt Julia and it is also from  this memory that she wishes to flee. <br />Almost immediately, Julia has very  strange experiences in her new home as well as with the mysterious blond  child. Julia attempts to make meaning of these events and at times doubts  her sanity. Her struggle to understand it made more difficult by  accidentally discovering the details of a gruesome murder of the past which  took place in her new home. A murder, which parallels horrifyingly close to  Julia's own life. As Julia learns more, she discovers a presence of evil  which is determined to destroy her.<br />Readers of the author's previous work  will find the action in this book to be higher paced, which is suitable to  the story. The plot never drags and is always interesting. The characters  are strong and very real. The author has also done an excellent job of  creating an eerie and, at times, surrealistic atmosphere which adds to the  terror of the story.  <br />This is by far one of the best horror novels ever  published. I recommend it to anyone interested in a frightening tale.	2000-08-19

Despite his extensive  travels all over Andalucia, Santiago has never encountered this church  before, but nevertheless decides that it is as good of place as any to  settle down for the night. Santiago then experiences a mysterious and  prophetic dream of hidden treasure at the Pyramids of Egypt. This dream  makes Santiago's thirst for knowledge, wisdom and new experiences even  stronger. After seeking advice from a gypsy and meeting a magical king,  Santiago must decide whether to give up everything familiar and comfortable  in his life and seek  the treasure, following the path of his true destiny  along the way. Or choosing, as most people do,  to remain, and finally lose  sight of his destiny. <br />Seeking ancient and worldly wisdom as well as the  treasure, Santiago travels to northern Africa. Faced with obstacles and  doubts from the beginning, Santiago finally reaches his destination. Along  the way, he makes friends, meets the love of his life and most  significantly, gains wisdom from an enigmatic alchemist.  <br />The lessons  and wisdom Santiago acquires during his adventure can be applied to  everyday life in today's society.  Although the story is a very simply  written allegory, the underlying wisdom is very powerful and profound.  Readers must be willing to open their eyes and minds and many parallels   between modern real life and Santiago's life can be found. These include  society's fear of change and the unwillingness to seek destiny and true  happiness, instead preferring to settle into a comfortable and familiar, if  not inhibiting, routine.  <br />For anyone with an open mind and an open heart  , this book has many lessons to teach.	2000-08-19

The old man's past, and the  actions which led him to flee to the Tierra del Feugo, have finally caught  up with him.  From there, the reader is taken to Hamburg, Germany. Juan  Belmonte, constantly mistaken for a Turk by his neighbors,  is a Chilean  revolutionary in exile. One night a mysterious stranger and his ever  faithful dog appear at Juan's place of work, a seedy strip club where Juan  is the bouncer. Condescendingly summoned to a meeting set for the next day  at a Hamburg insurance company, Juan immediately rebuffs the stranger.  However, when he is fired from his bouncer job and his neighbors are  petitioning to evict &quot;the Turk,&quot; Juan decides that it is perhaps  time for one more revolutionary-for-hire job, this one set in his native  Chile.   Meanwhile in Berlin, two former East German Stasi agents are also  planning a trip to Chile..........<br />What follows is a suspenseful but  always fun adventure. The action is fast paced and the plot is never slow.  Although the tone of the book is sarcastic and the characters are  satirized, a serious thread also runs through the book, notably the  atrocities of the Pinochet regime and Chile's struggle to forget its dark  past and focus and a new republic. For this as well as the character of  Juan Belmonte, the author has drawn on his experience in exile during  Chile's tumultuous period. <br />Altogether it is a fun little caper that is  sure to be entertaining.	2000-08-04

It is a classic masterpiece and is as enjoyable with each subsequent reading as it is the first time. Despite its horror genre, it is truly a  psychological mystery and the story contains deeper meanings than it may at  first seem. What exactly the main character of Count Dracula represents is  open to speculation.

Sold to a geisha &quot;family,&quot; Sayuri is at first sad and  lost in this strange new environment. However, her will to survive and  persevere is stronger than her grief and she accepts the cards that fate  has dealt her, vowing to become successful geisha. Her obstacles and  triumphs are chronicled, as well as her various adventures as a geisha.  <br />However, the annoying and irritating thread running throughout most of  the book is Sayuri's irrational and unbelievable infatuation with the  Chairman. This is a character that is never developed, indeed, readers are  never even privy to his real name. Sayuri's attempts at establishing a  romance with the Chairman eventually become pathetic and detract from what  could be a courageous and memorable character.  <br />The ending is so abrupt  and innocently simple it seems that the author finally got tired of writing  and decided to wrap everything up in a neat, little package. <br />Despite  these criticisms, this is still an entertaining and worthwhile read.  Because it does have merit, I believe readers and the story itself simply  deserved better.	2000-07-18

Port Moresby, an American and a self defined &quot;traveler&quot; as opposed to tourist, experiences a prophetic and metaphorical dream. Port  has traveled to North Africa with his wife Kit and friend Tunner to  experience new adventures and try to reestablish the emotional bond between  himself and Kit. Finding themselves in a harsh and hostile environment, the  trio must battle not only their situation but also conflicts within  themselves. As the story draws to a close, one does not survive and one  emerges forever changed by the brutal desert.  The third, who did not  venture into the Sahara, remains unchanged.  <br />The author has done an  excellent job creating a Saharan setting throughout the book. Descriptions  are rich and vivid. The story is both dramatic and suspenseful. My  complaint of the story, however, is that I thought far too little was done  with the Lyles, a supposed mother-son duo engulfed in suspicion. Had these  characters been allowed to develop and their motives made more clear, I  believe that it could have become a very interesting sub-plot. <br />This book  is an enjoyable and entertaining read about people in search of themselves  and seeking to reconnect. Their journeys and struggles will remain etched  in my memory for many years to come.	2000-07-17

A mysterious invitation, unsolved murders, a lost ancient manuscript and secret ambitions all form an integral part of the story.  This book is like a maze, an ultimate search for the truth along twisted  pathways with new surprises at every turn.<br />The ending is impossible to  guess although all of the pieces do fall perfectly into place. It is worth  it read this book again and try to look for the clues that the author has  sprinkled throughout. <br />A deeply atmospheric book, the author has done a  superb job of recreating a small, Victorian cathedral town and all of its  mystery. <br />Some have compared An Instance of the Fingerpost to this book.  In my opinion, there is absolutely no comparison. The Unburied is far  superior to the dry, dull An Instance of the Fingerpost. Indeed, most  mysteries seem dull and boring compared to this tour de force. Never to be  forgotten by me or any other mystery fan.	2000-05-29

The book begins with what is known of Anderson's early life and continues until  her death, spanning several decades, two continents and many court battles.  <br />However, I felt that the book leaned too heavily on the evidence that  supported Anderson's claim. From the mystery's beginning until its  conclusive end, there was always much evidence against the possibility on  Anderson being Anastasia. Some is included in the book, but not dwelt upon  as much as some of the other evidence.   <br />The updated section on the DNA  testing is fascinating and very well written and should prove once and for  all the claimant's identity, although some doubters still remain. <br />Even  though the mystery does conclude at the end of the book this is still a  fascinating read, especially for anyone interested in Russian or royal  history.	2000-05-18

He was an adventurer, a family man, a man who held interesting views on just about every subject under the sun, and finally, in his later years, a martyr to life.  Although this book was written by Renoir's middle son, Jean, it is  as vibrant and alive as if Renoir, himself, had just written the words in  his own hand.  Through this book we learn how the Renoir family left its  roots in Limoges and moved to Paris.  We read of Renoir's early years as a  painter of porcelain and how and why he became an artist, more  specifically, an Impressionist.  We learn of Renoir's marriage to Aline  Charigot of Essoyes, the birth of his three sons and his move to the south  of France.  Some of the most interesting sections of the book deal with  Renoir's feelings about the effect of light on a painting and why he   needed to paint in a &quot;natural&quot; setting.  Also, most interesting  are the chapters on the birth of Impressionism and Renoir's relationships  with the other artists of the time, such as Monet, Manet, Sisley and  Cezanne, just to name a few.  Lovingly and charmingly written, this book  truly brings Renoir to life and makes him accessible to all.  Absolutely a  must for anyone with even a passing interest in art or artists!	2000-05-04

What I got instead were many hours of sheer boredom.  The idea is excellent:  four people, each believing they possess the key to a mystery,  set down a narrative.  Each of the first three narrators has a piece of the  puzzle within his grasp, but fails to form the correct conclusion because  his vision is clouded with megalomaniacal self-grandeur.  While the use of  four narratives to tell the story is a wonderful idea, Pears' narrators  each use the same flat tone; there is nothing distinctive that sets one  narrator apart from another.  If this weren't enough, the story itself  lacks tension.  It is a dull recitation and that's all.  By the time I come  to Wood's narrative, arguably the most important since it is the last, I  was in the mood to do little more than skim.  The resolution of the story  was a terrible letdown and the ultimate fate of Sarah Blundy was so  fantastic it was nothing short of utterly ridiculous beyond all belief.   Even the true identity of the mysterious Marco da Cola and his real reason  for traveling to England were more than a stretch in credulity and that's  putting it nicely.  Peras' eye for period detail seems good, but there is  simply too much of it and little of it is woven into the actual fabric of  the story, as it should have been.  This book is definitely not in the same  league as Umberto Eco's gorgeous Name of the Rose, a truly five-star read.   There are so many good atmospheric mysteries out there, e.g., The Quincunx,  The Unburied, don't waste your valuable time with this one.	2000-04-24

There is no doubt that short selling should be an integral part of any market participant's strategy.  However, if you are looking for a reference explaining how to apply  technical analysis to the identification  of overvalued stocks, then this  book falls short. <br />I cannot blame the author for heavily emphasizing the  psychological aspect of short selling as too much enthusiasm, confidence  and greed are mostly what drive up a stock's price to unreasonable  valuations. Likewise, when the &quot;castles in the air&quot; disappear,  the stock's price normally plummets and creates a very profitable  opportunity for short sellers. It is critical to recognize when these  stages are at their peaks and Ms. Staley does provide tell tale signs. <br />I  think this book has something to offer all investors. Whether or not it is  found to be helpful largely depends on the individuals investment strategy  and what tools he relies upon.	2000-04-16

The author spins a tale of the high seas worthy of the Aubrey/Maturin novels of Patrick O'Brian.  But this book has more than high  seas drama.  It also has melodrama, pathos and high comedy yet to boot.   And the fact that Kneale was able to integrate more than twenty narrators  into one beautiful story is something of an accomplishment in itself.  The  voices all contribute to the overall whole and are woven together as well  as those in The Poisonwood Bible and in An Instance of the Fingerpost.   This is great literature.

As I began reading, I was pleasantly surprised by the book's excellence. I am sorry that the author didn't maintain it to the very end. <br />The mysterious circumstances of the story immediately caught my attention, demanding me to continue reading. In  the middle of the book I feel that story begins to stray a bit from Jenö,  the main character, and his passions and ambition. I found the end to be  rather abrupt and one that answers far too little. The bits of information  that the author offers do not add up, leaving the ending and the true fate  of the characters open to much debate.

Although I don't usually relate well to books featuring Americans, I thought this book had a universal appeal.  The story is set in the Congo of the 1960s and is the story of the family of Baptist missionary, Nathan  Price.  The story is told from the point of view of his wife, Orleanna and  each of their four daughters.  Although the jumps from one narrator to  another are quite frequent, they were excellently handled and the narrative  never sounded jerky.  It had a wonderful flow.  Each of the narrators has  her own distinctive voice, so much so that I could open the book to any  page and tell who was doing the narrating just by the tone of voice.  This  really made the people come alive.  And, although I had a hard time  identifying with the women, being a man, I did feel I had come to know them  extremely well and understand their problems, hopes and fears.  The  politics of the Congo were well integrated in the narrative and never  &quot;stood out.&quot;  Be assured, this is a story about a family, not a  political treatise.  I also became entranced with the setting and thought  the author did an excellent job of bringing the Congo alive.  Definitely  five stars.	2000-03-26

Although the premise is highly unique, Kafka does an excellent job of  detailing the most significant impact of this transformation-the tremendous  loss of Gregor's already defined place in human society. Shunned by society  and no longer accepted among the human race, Gregor spirals into the depths  of isolation, loneliness and despair.  This story bears resemblance to all  of Kafka's work, studying, in a very unusual setting, the darker but very  real and present aspects of human emotion and behavior. This is indeed a  metaphor of absurdity, but one whose emotional impact strikes dangerously  close to reality in all of us.	2000-03-20

Unfortunately this was not the case and instead the  reader is subjected to characters as lively as cardboard boxes, meandering  along until the flat ending is reached. The only exception is the  mother-in-law character, whose obnoxious, haughty manner does stand out  well. We can almost understand why the villianess does hate her so much.  This, and a inane sub-plot having nothing to do with the main story are the  only things that stand out. Mercifully, this book is very short.	2000-03-14

Andrew Miller has taken a great idea and created a mediocre book.  While I don't have to have every detail spelled  out, I would like to see characters working towards some sort of goal, even  if it's just to become a better person.  In Ingenious Pain, Miller simply  reports random events in the life of James Dyer.  There is no goal, no  plot, no point.  (We already know that a life without emotion is really no  life at all!)  The author has simply cast us to sea and let us drift.   Miller also denies us access to the characters' thoughts (a typical  beginner's mistake).  Had we been privy to those thoughts (especially  Dyer's) the novel would have been greatly enriched.  In my opinion, Miller  is being far too coy with us and coyness in the service of plot is really  not fair to the reader.  Finally, while Miller's writing style is  definitely not the purple prose of Anne Rice, it is much too flowery (the  absolute mark of the amateur...ask your writing teacher!).  Great books  don't need gimmicks.  Ingenious Pain is a wonderful premise that falls far  short of the mark.	2000-03-11

Beyond her frustration, we are never privy to any of her emotions. What did she think of her plight? Why did she never worry that Johnny, her lover, might reject her? I feel that the author made a mistake by never writing in Felicia's viewpoint during her scenes with Mr. Hilditch. We certainly know many of his feeling and thoughts concerning Felicia, but never, never any of her thoughts about her sinister friend. ... <br />The character  of Mr.  Hilditch is very well developed, unfortunately more so than the main character. I felt that too much of the book (one quarter) was devoted to Mr. Hilditch's downward spiral.

And the prose is wonderful.  But I really didn't like the characters in this book.  I saw the movie first and maybe that's the  problem--I thought the movie was very poor.  But the characters to me seem  a bit shallow, the ending is quite predictable and nothing of this book  stayed with me.  Still, it's a marvelous read if you're a Conroy fan.	2000-01-21

Throughout the book are the Queen's own letters, furthing our insight into this dynamic female ruler. After finishing this  book, I felt as though I knew Her Royal Highness personally!	2000-01-21

If you want to understand the pain of growing old or becoming ill, this book can tell you a lot and bring tears to your eyes as well.  An  unforgettable little gem.	2000-01-17

It is enormously frightening in a very subtle way. I found it easy to identify with the two main characters, whose lives are forever changed in an instant by the sudden appearance of evil.  It reminds us just how very fragile our surroundings really are and how  evil can have many, not so obvious faces. At the same time, we see how good  can triumph over darkness. Suspenseful to the end, I could barely put the  book down.	2000-01-17

It's quite obvious from the tone of the book that the only character this author cares about is himself!  Soooo tedious that every time I sat down to read, I found myself thinking about watering my tomato plants, which would  have been a LOT more interesting.  I could write more, but that would just  give this book free advertising, which is something I DEFINITELY DON'T want  to do.	2000-01-17

The book is a brilliant look at ordinary people living and coping with life's complexities.  The author does a fabulous job of  capturing the problems of our lives at their heart.  But don't read it when  you're depressed.  Although wonderfully written, it takes a look at the  darker side of life.  It is definitely not a &quot;feel good&quot; book,  although the ending does hold some hope, but it is one you cannot forget.	2000-01-17

I found the book to be a little &quot;thin,&quot; and the authors do emphasize the negative aspects of character while  glossing over the positive.  It is a fun little read, although I doubt that  customers purchasing books on Buddhism are looking for a fun read.  Nevertheless, this is a good book for those new to the Buddhist tradition.	2000-01-15

This book is not at all frightenting although it is a bit suspenseful. The ending is a  surprise, if the reader hasn't heard of this certain theory already, but  rather cliche. I found the reasoning behind the Witch's actions rather  weak. Clearly this story is fiction.	2000-01-15

Rich in detail, I felt like I was in Tsarist Russia,  watching the dramatic events as they unfolded. Recommended reading for any  history buff.	2000-01-15

This is one you'll use.  Swain tells us how to create all types of story characters, how to make them credible, how to describe them, how to  motivate them and much more.  The book's easy, fun-to-read style makes it  ideal for beginners, though more experienced writers can profit as well.   Every page offers something worthwhile!	2000-01-15

The author describes the impact of company announcements, mergers and world events on the market and  how an investor can take advantage of these situations. The author also  informs the reader how to evaluate his own psychology and design a winning  investment strategy based on his own needs.	2000-01-15

Mayes is to Italy what Mayle is to Provence.  Frances captures the essence of Tuscany perfectly:  the wine, the olive groves, the music, the food.  This could well be the best  advertisement for Italy ever written.  Highly recommended for anyone who  loves Italy or is planning a trip there.	2000-01-13

This book is more than a well-researched travel guide.  It's also the most gorgeous tribute to Italy I've ever seen.  I'm an Italian, living in Como, and have visited every one of the villages in the book and I can tell you,  they are as gorgeous as the authors' interpretations.  The photographs are  some of the most beautiful I've ever seen, and, like a previous reviewer,  I, too, get misty-eyed just looking at them.  If you want to travel to  Italy or just love Tuscany, you won't go wrong with this book!	2000-01-13

Perhaps Bakis should have started with something a little less ambitious.  While the basic premise is good, I have to agree with all those reviewers who said it was not developed properly, the plot was thin and full of holes, and the  characters unsympathetic.  Like my old English teacher used to say--learn  the mundane before attempting the fantastic!	2000-01-09

The author's style is bland and flat and the only fact he managed to tell us that we didn't already know was that he had &quot;sort of&quot; dated Jennifer  Grey.  Wow.  Who cares?  I, for one, wish the publishers would have given  us five or six good, but lesser-hyped books, rather than paying megabucks  for what's already been printed in the newspapers.	2000-01-08

I had to force myself to keep turning the pages.  But I don't blame Darden; he's an intelligent man and a skilled writer.  If  you're one of the few who STILL hasn't satisfied your &quot;O.J.  quota&quot; this book, along with Vincent Bugliosi's, is the best.	2000-01-08

A joy to read.  The author makes us feel as though we knew Teresa personally.  I've read other books about St. Teresa and I've also  read Teresa's own works.  I was impressed, really in awe.  Medwick made me  realize what I should have known all along:  Teresa was both beautiful and  brilliant, and had she been a 20th century woman she would have found many  outlets for her boundless energy, enthusiasm and imagination.  Living in  the circumscribed world of 16th century Spain, however, Teresa's  imagination worked against her; although possessing great business acumen,  the woman was crazy as a loon.  This book, however, is well worth the money  and the time and is extremely enjoyable, myth-shattering though it may be.   I'll no doubt read it again some day.	2000-01-08

So, who doesn't?  I liked this book because I like Martha and I like reading about her.  Anything about her.  Her good points AND her bad.  But I really think it was unfair of  Oppenheimer to focus on just the bad in the world of Martha.  The woman is  a human being--and an amazing one at that--he should have included some of  her frustrations and wonders as well.  Had the book been more balanced, I  would have rated it higher, but it's good if you only want to know one side  of a person--the bad side.  Rock on, Martha--you're the greatest!	2000-01-07

I never knew women actually LIKED to TALK  about problems until I read this book, but I've found that they do.   Machismo and feminism aside, we are definitely NOT alike and won't be in  our lifetimes, so make like a duck and let the corniness run off your back  like water.  John Gray has a lot of good ideas that can help us all to get  along better and better.	2000-01-07

The characters are not really developed enough to make us care what happened to them, and the plot is extremely thin. As such, it is way too long and I found I had to force myself to finish.  I had to read it several times to make sure I caught everything.  Frazier is a novice writer and it shows.  His style needs a lot of work, to say the least.  Reading &quot;Ada said,&quot; and &quot;Ruby said,&quot; tacked on to the end of every sentence was irritating.  For all those who think this is &quot;literature,&quot; try Umberto Eco's, &quot;The Name of the Rose.&quot;	2000-01-07

Throw in a hero, the requisite bad guys, the requisite romance, and bingo...another bestseller.  Only this bestseller has a long way to go.  The beginning was intriguing  and I thought Grisham was finally going to get it right.  But the book lost  steam with every page and the ending was the biggest letdown in any book  I've ever read.  Formula writing CAN be superb...a la Mary Higgins  Clark..but Grisham just doesn't click.	2000-01-07

Because it's true.  More than a novel of one of history's most heinous crimes, Fatal Vision is, at its heart, a darkly chilling character  study of the deranged, narcissistic family slayer, Jeffrey MacDonald.  That  Joe McGinniss was able to so perfectly catch both MacDonald's veneer of  charm as well as his megalomaniacal self-centeredness, is a tour de force  unmatched by any other author.  A masterpiece of the written word, Fatal  Vision stands alone in the annals of &quot;true crime&quot; literature.   The emotional impact will leave you reeling for years.	2000-01-05

In &quot;Hotel  Pastis,&quot; Mayle works the special brand of magic that he first showed  us in &quot;A Year in Provence.&quot;  The only book that's ever made me  want to leave Italy!
