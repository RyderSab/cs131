If Dick Morris is going to write a book about Hillary Clinton, I think it would have been wise to talk to people who know her i.e. her friends and family.

I couldn't put it down once I started it.  I definitely agree that this is one of the most crooked, deceptive, and secretive administrations this country has ever had.  After reading this book, I feel we need a change in leadership.  We have got to get this country back on the right track.  I think George Bush is a likable person, but as a president, he is clueless how to run the country.  This book backs up my belief's.  This book is a great read!	2004-04-02

Many people are questioning this man's motive for writing this book, but I don't think anyone can question the honest and sincerity of this book.  I just hope that America opens their eyes and realizes what the current Bush administration has done to jeopardize the safety of its citizens. And to think, this guy is a republican and wanted Bush to be elected president.  It says something about the integrity of a man to speak against his own party.  It tells me he CARES and is willing to speak up for a country he loves.  Very, very good book!	2004-03-29
