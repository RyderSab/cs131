US	52446483	R1KXEYXCFUPQKF	0446524190	719213326	Gods in Alabama	Books	3	5	10	N	N	X Rating	Not much about gods and not much about Alabama, but an awful lot about sex.  The central character, Arlene, has left Posset, Alabama and lived in Chicago for several years.  She has not returned to Alabama because she may face arrest on charges of murdering a high school classmate named Jim Beverly.  He was a star high school football player and considered a god by many. When she finally comes back to Posset, she brings with her the man she plans to marry.  He happens to be black. He provides a bit of humor in responding to the reaction of some of Arlene's family.  The story has mystery in regard to Jim Beverly, but it is mostly introduced and resolved in the last few pages. <br /> <br />I found the book to be fairly interesting but would recommend only for mature readers.  <br />	2005-09-25
US	52446483	R7UG3TTXKRK2I	1595230068	626637009	The Truth About Hillary: What She Knew, When She Knew It, and How Far She'll Go to Become President	Books	3	19	43	N	N	Another Look At Hillary Clinton	Other authors have expounded on a large portion of the information in this book.  Although the book's content can largely be considered anti-Hillary, the author is also complimentary of her in several instances.  <br /> <br />The author paints a picture of Hillary Clinton as a woman obsessed with ambition and her own ability to attain her goals.  She is also pictured as one who will change her positions as needed to fulfill her ambitions.  She is shown as one who will lie in order to enhance her image.  In other words, she is a politician.   <br />  <br />Some discussion is devoted to those who influenced her and helped shape her character.  Of course no such book is complete without addressing the sex life of her husband and her reaction or lack thereof.  <br /> <br />Some of the more interesting revelations by the author are the relationship with Senator Moynihan, who retired from the senate seat to which she was elected, her work on the Nixon Impeachment Inquiry and her lackluster effort to elect John Kerry to the presidency.  <br /> <br />I found that the author identified his sources within the text to a large extent and also provided extensive notes at the end of the book giving sources of information.   <br />	2005-07-04

It is as easy reading as most other novels I have read. The book covered the early life of Rayford Steele who was a principal character of the Left Behind series.  Much of the book is devoted to the conception, birth, and early life of Nicolae Carpathia the antichrist of the Left Behind series.  Evil spirits is recognized as being at work in opposition to Christianity. The whole series of books is a possible scenario of the last days as presented in Bible prophecy, particularly the prophecy of the Bible's last book, Revelations.  This book and the other books of the series are based on the author's interpretation of the Bible, an interpretation which I believe is compatible with that of many Bible scholars. Many would disagree with the interpretation and many would say that nobody could interpret Revelations. If  \\"The Rising\\" had been published at the time, I would have enjoyed reading it prior to reading \\"Left Behind\\", the first book of the series of the same name. I would recommend \\"The Rising\\" and the Left Behind series to anyone having an interest in prophecy about the end times.	2005-05-13

It is interesting reading because the author had an impressive career in law enforcement and the criminal justice system beginning as a policeman in a small Michigan town.  Among his significant accomplishments were his contributions to the profiling of criminals.  This activity started while he was with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Chief of the Behavioral Science Unit.  By examining the evidence at a crime scene investigators were able to establish a profile of the criminal and thus narrow down the search. <br /> <br />In the depiction of some of the horrible crime scenes witnessed by the author, not a great deal was left to the imagination. <br /> <br />After the death of his wife, he entered a Catholic seminary and became concerned with looking at crime from the criminal side in order to determine what went wrong with the individual.  It is his belief that some criminals are just evil.  However, he believes there are some who made one wrong turn in life.  Except for that one occurrence they may not have entered into the world of crime. <br /> <br />Two of the more notable cases discussed in the book were that of Jon Benet Ramsey and the case of Ted Bundy. <br />	2005-04-22

In the first the candidate was assassinated.  In the second the candidate was kidnapped.  The main characters are the agents who provided the protection for the candidates.  Sean King was next to presidential candidate Ritter when he was killed.  Joan Dillinger was also on the scene.  Michelle Maxwell was the agent in charge when candidate Bruno was kidnapped.  These three become involved in trying  to determine who was behind the crimes and whether there was a connection between the two.  Several people  connected in some way  to the investigation are murdered as the story unfolds.  Usually, a mysterious \\"man in a Buick\\" was at the murder scene. <br /> <br />Toward the end of the book it became more a chore than pleasure to finish.  The latter part seemed to add confusion rather than contributing a lot to the story. I probably would have given a four or five star rating if the author had seen fit to wrap up the story about one-hundred pages earlier. <br /> <br />Overall though, it was an interesting book to read with much mystery and interesting characters. <br />	2005-03-04

After wielding his power in Washington DC for some years, he goes to federal prison to serve a twenty year term.  The outgoing President grants numerous pardons creating a suspicion of  \\"pardons for cash\\" and unexpectedly grants a pardon to Backman.  So after six years in prison Backman is released from prison but is not really free.  He is whisked out of the country by federal agents and soon realizes he has nobody to trust.  While in DC, Backman had become involved in attempting to sell an advanced secret software system to other governments.  Some Pakistani scientists had discovered some previously unknown advanced Chinese satellites while investigating a satellite launched by India to spy on Pakistan.  The software they developed could render these mysterious Chinese satellites useless and could otherwise control them.  The scientists went to Backman to ask him to broker a deal which would probably be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Of course several nations would be interested. <br /> <br />For most of the book Backman is hiding in Italy for there are several countries with agents who want him killed.  We are introduced to Italian history, customs, food and language.  Much Italian is used throughout the book, but luckily for me, English translations are given for each use of Italian.  There is a great deal of suspense as to the survival of Backman as he moves about Italy and finally attempts his escape back to the United States.  <br /> <br />I found the book to be one of the more interesting books of the author but felt some loose ends were left hanging at its conclusion. <br />	2005-01-26

This includes both friends and enemies of our country.  It concerns the spread of both advanced conventional weapons technology and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) technology as well as weapon hardware.  In Iraq America faced many weapons supplied to Iraq by these nations. <br /> <br />The author details the activities of such nations as China, Pakistan, Libya, Russia and North Korea as well as the United Nations. Though some governments have obviously supported the selling of weapons to terrorist supporting nations, it is clear that much of the basis for this action has been the worldwide recognized trait called greed.  Many  a company's concern for profits overrides any hesitancy to sell to so called \\"rogue\\" nations. The author also points out the possibility that Iraq's WMDs were hidden in Syria prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq <br /> <br />This book  clearly brings attention to the dangers resulting from the proliferation of WMDS caused by various countries.  My impression was that China has been the greatest problem. Of course the U.S. is not guiltless in this proliferation when we consider the technology secrets which China has obtained from our country in the past. The Proliferation Security Initiative of the Bush Administration is shown as the best hope of stopping the further spread of WMD capability throughout the world. <br /> <br />I found the book to be interesting and well researched. <br />	2005-01-14

The central character of the story is Tom Langdon, an investigative reporter who has relegated himself to writing about furniture following his more adventurous existence with his longtime girl friend, Eleanor, in foreign lands covering wars and such.  He decides to take a cross-country train trip partly to fulfill a request from his now deceased father and partly to reflect on his own life and to see a friend on the West Coast.  The Capitol is the train to Chicago where he changes to the Southwest Chief for the rest of the trip.  There are colorful characters on the train and one gets a good insight into the domain of travel by rail. Tom is very surprised to find that Eleanor is on the same train.  He has never forgotten her but has not seen her since she left him while overseas.  He is overwhelmed by the coincidence and does some checking to try to verify that it indeed was a coincidence.  Eleanor is on the train with her boss Max Powers, a movie producer as he is considering a movie with a train setting.  For Eleanor seeing Tom was certainly not love at second sight. Two other travelers are planning to get married on the train as they go from Chicago to Los Angeles.  Max decides to give them a great wedding and film it as well.  After being snowbound in Colorado, the train continues to L.A. where mysteries are solved and some surprises revealed.	2004-11-24

He highlights the times when the number one terrorist could have been killed or captured but there was no go-ahead given from the highest level.  Opportunities for obtaining foreign intelligence from other governments regarding Osama bin Laden were also met with inaction.  There were those in the lower echelons of the administration who were dedicated to finding and dealing with Bin Laden but the support at higher levels was pretty well non-existent except for Richard Clarke.  There was the well publicized lack of  translators of mideast languages in the intelligence arena and an effort to solve this problem was not supported at the highest level of the administration.  The author also provides considerable evidence to support his contention that there was a significant connection between Iraq and the network of Osama bin Laden. <br /> <br />In short the author maintains that Osama bin Laden had declared war on the United States by several attacks on U.S. interests, but the Clinton Administration did not declare war on him and made little response to the attacks. I found the book to hold my interest but to provide more detail at times than I really wanted.  <br />	2004-11-24

As many of us have long known or suspected, the author confirms that there is not a dimes worth of difference between the Democrats and Republicans in many ways.  He maintains that there is a fraternity consisting of both Democratic and Republican leaders and their staffs, which runs the government regardless of which party is in power.  He is especially concerned with the runaway expenditures as votes are traded so that each representative or senator obtains funding for his own pet projects, many of them in support of his or her own constituency.  As a result the federal budget is not under control and thus is rarely balanced.  He highlights the fact that there is built in control over any individual's ability to initiate reform.  As he says to reform you have to get on the government reform committee, and to get on a committee of your choice, you have to be a \\"team\\" player for those in control. <br /> <br />The author was a member of the so-called \\"class of 94.\\"  The Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives that year running on their \\"contract with America\\" calling for some big changes.  In actuality, Joe Scarborough found that after much effort by many of these committed freshmen congressmen, it was to be business as usual in Washington D.C. <br /> <br />Scarborough has some good words for Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, but he also blames Gingrich for his failure to stand up to President Clinton.  He conveys that the failure of Gingrich to outlast Clinton in the 1996 budget impasse, which resulted in a shutdown of the government, was the death of the Republican revolution brought on by the class of 94 and the contract with America, and became the initial step in the spending spree which continues today even under President Bush.  Even though President Bush has evidently made little effort to control spending, the author still believes that he is the best choice for President at this time.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-18

I too realize that many of us take these games too seriously but he did a great job of illustrating this fact.  You would not have to be an Alabama fan or a serious football fan to enjoy and learn from this book.  He undertakes the envious job of following the Crimson Tide through every game of a football season and luckily chose an ideal season to pursue this task.  The team endured a big early season upset and struggled under a coach having been retained by the university after conduct which many thought would lead to his dismissal.  However, the Tide came back with upsets of its own to win the conference championship. The author joins the RV contingent at each game and meets and describes several interesting characters. He gives a good picture of the Alabama fan with the exception that one might get the impression that we all get drunk at or after the game.  Many, if not most of us do not.    <br /> <br />This is an interesting,easy reading book. <br />	2004-09-15

Once this is the case the pressure of satisfying goals of self is off because these goals are no longer the most important aspect of one's life.  The author reinforces this theme throughout the book with numerous examples of the \\"old way\\", putting self first and the \\"new way\\", putting God first.  When we put God first we no longer are primarily after blessings from God, but are primarily after a close relationship with God. <br /> <br />To me this book was not a book just to read but a book to study. <br />	2004-07-26

Rapp is willing to kill terrorists in order to get other terrorists to talk and thus save the lives of tens or even hundreds of thousands of his fellow countrymen. It is not always best for his superiors to have complete knowledge of his activities.<br />Memorial Day is an intriguing story of reaction to information of a pending nuclear attack on the United States.  The author goes behind the scenes to show the workings and hindrances of government agencies in the battle against terrorists as well as the political impact on decision-making,  <br />The short chapters give many opportunities to take a break from reading, but this is difficult as you anticipate the further actions in facing imminent danger.<br />I only found slow reading with the detailed military action depicted in the early chapters of the book.<br />It is difficult to believe that the heroics of a Mitch Rapp could be a realistic expectation within our government, but our lives may well depend on it.	2004-07-19

From there he observes and participates in the story surrounding   a rape-murder and its aftermath.  This is another story of good versus bad.  The Padgitt family living on a small island near Clanton represent the bad. Their activities over the years included stealing, counterfeiting, moonshining and gunrunning. They have pretty much \\"owned\\" the county sheriff for a number of years and have been left free to pursue their own activities.  Danny Padgitt is charged with rape-murder as the victim has accused him by name just before her death.  He is tried and convicted in Clanton.  He leaves the courtroom with a threat to the convicting jury.  The good is represented by the Ruffin family.  This is a colored family living \\"across the tracks\\" so to speak, in a part of Clanton called Lowtown.  The mother, Callie, was a member of the Danny Padgitt jury.  The Ruffins had seven children and six of them had earned a PhD.  Willie Traynor spends considerable time with Callie and her family and often enjoys her sumptuous southern cooking.<br />After a few years in the state prison Danny Padgitt is released and jurors begin to meet untimely deaths.<br />Through Willie Traynor the author weighs in with opinions on a number of social/moral issues.  These include segregation in Mississippi, prohibition, and the impact of powerful discount stores on businesses of small towns.	2004-03-18

He also has recommendations for changes in our intelligence gathering and analysis that he believes might prevent future terrorist attacks.  My main impression of the message of \\"Breakdown\\" was that the principal problem was the bureaucracy.  I view such things as inability of lower level personnel being able to communicate concerns to levels higher than their immediate supervisor and the tendency of an agency to protect its own turf at the expense of not sharing information with other agencies to be to be bureaucratic failures.  These are situations the author illustrated within the agencies such as CIA and FBI prior to the September 11 tragedy. <br />Although the Clinton administration comes in for particular blame in neglecting to give proper attention to matters of intelligence, the Congress and Bush Administration were not left free of blame.  <br />Some problems presented by the author as causes of \\"Breakdown\\" were the failure of the agencies to adjust to changing circumstances.  There was too much dependence on electronic intelligence gathering and not enough emphasis on the need for human involvement.  There was also too much dependence on obtaining intelligence from foreign governments.<br />Many pages of appendices were provided.  Some were of little use due to lack of information or being unreadable.  One appendix of particular interest, however, was the detailed well-written letter from a Minneapolis FBI agent to the FBI Director in which she is very frank about the shortcomings of the agency in dealing with information about the so called twentieth hijacker of September 11. <br />I found the book to be both interesting and informative.	2004-02-06

The author contends that there is a liberal domination of not only television but also of newspapers and book publishers.  She presents many examples as well as statistical data to support her claim that conservatives are treated unfairly by the various media.<br />She points out the inability of liberals to gain any degree of success in talk radio after several attempts to do so.  The internet is discussed as the media by which conservatives are now able to disseminate their viewpoints with success.<br />Considerable discussion is given concerning the close 2000 presidential election and the positions taken by the TV networks and their possible influence intended or not.<BR>The book is sprinkled with a great deal of humor as the author makes her points.<br />As a conservative, I enjoyed the book and found it enlightening beyond what I had already observed in the media.	2004-01-26

David Schippers shows that there was truly a sellout in the so called senate trial on the impeachment of President Clinton.  One can see the frustration of the author after participating in the collection of a vast amount of information and the House Managers not being allowed to present the bulk of this information to the senate along with appropriate witnesses.  <br />It is his contention that the sellout was made by the senate leadership.  There was no interest in even looking at the gathered evidence, and it was obvious that senatorial minds were made up even before they were sworn in before the Chief Justice for the trial.  This can be compared to a jury in a criminal case having their minds made up prior to being sworn in and hearing the evidence.<br />The reason for the senators not wanting the President convicted in the senate was largely due to the polls showing support of the American people for the President.  It can be argued that this support held fast because the Administration was able to keep all Democratic senators loyal and thus maintain the argument of this being just a partisan Republican effort to overthrow the results of the previous presidential election.<br />Again this can be compared to jurors in a criminal trial voting not to convict the defendant because the majority of people did not want the person convicted.	2004-01-22

However, the scenerio presented in this book contradicts my concept of heaven in that I believe there will be no anger, fear or pain in heaven.  The main character, Eddie seemed to experience all of these.  The author does present some compelling thoughts.  It may well be that we will at some point understand the influence our life has had on others as well as the impact of another life on our own. At any rate I agree that this easy-to-read book could provide an inspiration to anyone who reads it.	2003-12-06

The story is centered in a small Southern town.  This is one of the many small towns where high school football is taken very seriously.  Coach Eddie Rake is dying and many of his former players have returned to Mesinna to await his death. The story covers only a few days but there is much review of the past as the players talk of the glory days of Mesinna football.  Coach Rake had led the school's teams to unprecedented success.  In fact the school had at one time held the national record for consecutive victories.  <br />The author probably patterned his Coach Rake after some real life coaches.  I found at least one similarity to one well known college coach.  Neely Crenshaw is the central character of the book.  He has returned to Mesinna for the first time in several years.  As Quarterback, he had been one of the greatest stars for Mesinna.<br />In the process of telling this story, the writer alludes to some high school related problems such as the emphasis placed on football at the expense of other school activities.  Also, this being a southern town the issue of school (and football team) integration was addressed.  Finally, you have the win at any cost syndrome so evident in some football programs.  In this case, one result was the loss of the life of a young boy.<br />This book unlike many of the author's earlier books has nothing to do with attorneys and the law.  In general, his earlier law oriented books were more exciting reading in my opinion. However, I found this book to be an interesting light read and of course rather short..  So if you consider reading the book to be a waste of time, at least it will not be a lot of time.	2003-10-09

Sutter's Cross is a book one could feel free to recommend to his or her grandparents and grandchildren.  Many of the characters introduced might well be found in your own town, or at least someone with a strong resemblance.  One of the central characters is a man named Harley.  He is new to Sutter's Cross and has an aura of mystery about him which is revealed at least to some extent as the story evolves.  The story is interesting with some mystery and occasional humor.  One important observation about the book is that we are able to see both flaws and good aspects of individuals in Sutter's Cross and see how the good of each character emerges for the benefit of the people of the town.  I would say the book has a religious orientation with some good lessons for life.	2003-08-03

However, unlike some books, this was written by one who observed first hand much of that which he relates to the reader.  The writer details a lack of action by the President in some critical situations.  It is somewhat frightening in retrospect as you think of what the consequences could have been.  The author emphasizes the lack of respect that the President displayed to the military and his apparent lack of concern for maintaining a strong military preparedness.<BR>I found it to be easy reading and to me a confirmation of the concerns expressed in other books about this President and his administration.	2003-07-01

The setting is a few years beyond 2003 and the assumption is that Iraq was not dealt with in 2003.  Much of the story centers  around the U.S. president and his protection.  Insight was given to much behind the scenes activity of such government security agencies as the CIA, FBI and Secret Service.  In the background of the story is a \\"solution\\" to the Palestine - Israel problem which involves a massive joint oil venture.  The final chapter ends rather abruptly with a nuclear  confrontation.  The book kept my interest throughout.  I believe the book would be of interest to anyone with conservative leanings and an interest in government operation at the international level.	2003-03-20

Office of Public Defender (OPD) who seemingly has no bright future as a lawyer.  Suddenly, and almost unrealistically (but this is just a fictional story) he is established with his own law firm in first class offices and given, for starters, one extremely profitable case.  This is a case in which a drug company has put a drug on the market with a very dangerous side effect in some instances, which impacts not only the person for which the drug is prescribed.  As the story proceeds we are exposed to the process of accomplishing settlements of potential class-action lawsuits with large attorney fees and sometimes less than fair treatment of plaintiffs.  We also find that at least in fictional characters there is a great deal of greed lurking in the law profession.  <br /> Clay is romantically involved from the beginning with Rebecca, daughter of wealthy social climbing parents in D.C.  Of course the parents aren't pleased with the OPD career of the potential son-in-law, and this helps the romance to go sour. <br /> I found this to be one of the most interesting of the author's novels.	2003-02-20

The author tells the history of Charleston around a story of the Bell family as it evolves from the Revolutionary War to a few years beyond the War Between the States.  There was a bit of suspense and a few surprises along the way.  The history of Charleston reveals a great deal of American history.  Within the Bell family there were Patriots as well as Loyalists in the earlier war and Secessionists as well as Unionists  in the later war.  Economic considerations had a great deal to do with one's attitude in both wars.  For instance the attitude toward slavery even in South Carolina was often determined more by whether or not one could profit from it than by humane considerations.  The author drew vivid word pictures of the treatment of slaves leaving a lasting impression of what in many cases was inhumane treatment.  The slavery issue was not the only cause of the South having dissatisfaction with the federal government.  Nullification laws had been passed in earlier years because of what was considered unfair tariffs imposed on the South.  Having visited Charleston, it was easy to picture Meeting Street, King Street and other locations mentioned in the book.  The genealogy chart provided in the book was rather helpful in keeping track of the Bell family descendants and other Charleston characters in the story.	2003-01-10

The author discusses what Southern Baptists have in common with all Christians followed by the commonalities with other Protestant denominations such as Methodists and Presbyterians.  He then elaborates on the distinctive Southern Baptists beliefs and practices prior to 1979.  He also details a number of minority views which have appeared among Southern Baptists over the years.  In 1979 the Southern Baptist Convention came under the control of the Conservative element of the convention and has continued to be thus dominated.  During this period many of the members of the Moderate element have formed another Baptist organization called the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship.<br />Having laid this groundwork, the author then talks about what has changed among Southern Baptists since 1979 and what other changes are likely in the near future.<br />Although he does express his own opinion at times about some controversal matters and one can detect whether he leans to the moderate or conservative view, he is able to keep his presentation factual and I believe unbiased.	2002-08-10

He also documents that in most instances the result of such shakedown was mainly for the benefit of  Jackson and his organizations such as PUSH and very little benefit for the common black person.  According to the author, Jackson is a preacher with low moral values (though not the first one I assume).  He also paints Jackson as a politician with his greatest concern being for his own welfare (he may not be the only politician in this category).  <br />A great deal of space is devoted to tagging Jackson with guilt by association.  The primary example is his half brother, Noah Robinson.  This seems to be done however, to show a connection to a Chicago gang.  Noah Robinson is apparently not a person you would want to use as a reference on a resume`.  There is some discussion of Jackson's meddling in foreign policy including a visit with Castro in Cuba.  Clinton also appointed him as Envoy to Africa to promote democracy there.  The author maintains that he used these opportunities to also promote business interests of he and his friends.<br />Though Jesse Jackson has quite a following, not all blacks are pleased with him.  The author tells of a black person named Peterson who grew up in Alabama and has started an annual day for the Repudiation of Jesse Jackson.  He has done this on Martin Luther Kings' birthday to illustrate the difference between what he calls King's dream and Jackson's nightmare.<br />Finally, Jackson did not miss out on the Clinton pardon fiasco.  He was able to obtain some last minute pardons but was unsuccessful on behalf of his half brother, Noah Robinson.<br />The book was interesting but I did not find it to be easy reading because of much detail in places..	2002-07-19

He showed courage in writing this book since he was a part of the media (CBS) and thus was pointing out this fault in those who were his fellow workers.  Even though he has many liberal views, he was honest enough to recognize and report this bias in spite of the fact that the bias was in favor of positions he often supported.   The view presented is an inside perspective of the  presentation of news on CBS.  The author seems to have a special problem with Dan Rather of CBS but doesn't dismiss the news anchors of NBC and ABC from the accusations of bias.  Many examples are given of the bias shown by CBS and other news media as they report news events in such a way as to present liberal causes in a good light.  At times he contrasts the examples with what might be called a  \\"what if\\" scenario with the assumption that a like news event would be reported in such a way as to demean the conservative cause.  His examples are numerous and I believe convincing, though I must admit that I may be biased..  The book is both very interesting and informative.	2002-03-30

Yet he introduces the reader to him with such stories and descriptions that this reader is left feeling he is someone he has known.  Avas Man begins just prior to the birth of Charlie Bundrum  in 1907 and continues until beyond his death.  It is a story of a man coping with whatever life has to offer. The author captures the language and modes of people living in rural Alabama and Georgia in the early twentieth century while giving a vivid description of their life particularly in the depression and World War ll periods.  Though the family suffered hard times, Avas Man brought them through with hard work while earning respect of those who knew him.  Since the author was born after the death of his grandfather, his information was gleaned from his older relatives and friends who had known him.  A man named Hootie who was befriended by Charlie Bundrum adds color to this family story.  A very enjoyable book.	2002-02-23

The book is filled with many quotations of both creation and evolutionist scientists in support of some of his arguments. <br />Darwin presented his findings as a theory of evolution in 1859.  Today it is often presented as fact.

US	52446483	R2D3E5JV5UJCRQ	0895261677	314528012	The Final Days: The Last, Desperate Abuses of Power by the Clinton White House	Books	3	14	25	N	N	Some Example for America	Barbara Olson was certainly no fan of the Clintons.  However, she does show fairness in this book by agreeing that there was justification for some pardons by Clinton.  She also quotes some liberal Democrats who express their disgust with Clinton's last minute pardon escapade.  She does point out that these same Democrats could not bring themselves to condemn Clinton for some of the earlier scandals while she maintains that the pardoning and White House furniture scandals of the last days of his term were only a continuation of the character displayed in the earlier sexual scandals.  The Marc Rich pardon of course receives special attention in the book and leaves one wondering how someone with integrity could justify such a pardon of one who at the time was on one of the Justice Department's &quot;most wanted&quot; lists. <br />Sometimes there is a little too much detail such as several pages listing the names of the pardoned. But overall, I found the book both interesting and informative.	2002-01-12

In fact I do not consider it a John Grisham classic.  Nevertheless it is light reading and enjoyable.  The author spins an interesting tale of a couple who had reached the point of not wishing to participate in Christmas activities, at least for this particular Christmas. Perhaps most of us at one time or another were not enthusiastic for Christmas decorating, Christmas shopping or Christmas parties.  This particular couple dicided to do something about it.  As a result we are privy to the obstacles they faced laced with a fair amount of humor. Some Christmas spirit did find its way into the story.	2001-12-20

My understanding of the history of the Colonial Period was refreshed and supplemented. Not only did I learn of the character of John Adams but found a better understanding of others such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin.  The book was easy to read and provided new insight to the trials of this period and our debt to these patriots, not the least of which was Abigail Adams.  I would recommend this book to anyone with even a small interest in American History.	2001-09-27
