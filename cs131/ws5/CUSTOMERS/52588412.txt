By the late 1920s, he had eclipsed rival Mack Sennett both artistically and financially.  His studio built Harold Lloyd and Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy into major comedy stars.  And lots of lesser comedians like Snub Pollard, Charley Chase, Our Gang, Will Rogers, and Thelma Todd made funny films there too. <br /> <br />While a comprehensive artistic history of the studio has yet to be written, Mr. Ward's book goes into great detail on the inner workings of the business side of movie making.  From the beginning of the studio, Roach had problems with Pathe booking his films into theaters.  Pathe complained that the Roach films were not funny, and did not always pay Roach enough to make a good profit.  After Roach signed a distribution agreement with M-G-M, things were much rosier, especially because Laurel & Hardy became such big stars. <br /> <br />Roach even secretly made a Laurel & Hardy feature film, and many more followed.  Roach also made a few dramatic films too, like OF MICE AND MEN and ONE MILLION BC.  Roach's studio survived into the 1950s, being run by Hal Roach, Jr. and making television programs.  However, after World War II the studio's glory days were behind them. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of Harold Lloyd, Laurel & Hardy, Charley Chase, or Our Gang, this book is a must read.  While critical assesments of films are only in a small appendix, this book will tell you everything else about the struggles that the Roach personnel had making great comedies.  Although Roach certainly was successful, you will be surprised with all of the failed comedy series that he tried.  And you will discover that Roach was a much better producer than director.  His later directoral films were not very good. <br /> <br />Mr. Ward's book is extensively researched and end-noted.  It belongs on the bookshelf of any silent comedy or sound comedy fan.	2005-07-21

Laurel & Hardy were certainly in their prime while at the Hal Roach Studios from 1927 through 1939.  Most books simply restate the belief that their post-Roach features are junk, and spend as little time on them as possible. <br /> <br />Mr. MacGillivray reviews each post-Roach film in great detail.  He convincingly argues that some of the films are not really that bad.  Some films, like JITTERBUGS, are certainly very good.  Other films are not as horrible as their reputation suggests.  But he judges some of their MGM and Fox features pretty poor even after re-evaluating them.  MacGillivray's research sheds light on which films Stan had creative input into, and which ones he had no input into at all. <br /> <br />I found the story of some of the films, especially UTOPIA, to be fascinating.  After the boys have retired from films, Robert Youngstown resurrected their career through his compilation films.  Youngstown, who won an Oscar, was an interesting character too.  He had a big ego, and his eating habits literally caused his death.  The book also goes into the different incarnations of the films on the home movie format and on video. <br /> <br />If you are any kind of Laurel and Hardy fan, you must read this book.  It makes a perfect companion to LAUREL & HARDY: THE MAGIC BEHIND THE MOVIES and LAUREL OR HARDY, which also cover specific films of the boys' career.	2005-05-10

Anderson had a problem.  His studio was based in Chicago, and he needed lots of sunshine to film short films for nickelodeons.  Unfortunately, the cold Chicago weather made it difficult to film outside for several months.  He packed up his troupe and tried filming in Santa Monica, Lakeside, and San Rafael, California, Morrison, Colorado, El Paso, Texas, and other places.  Finally, he found the perfect spot for a new studio to use for westerns -- Niles (now Fremont) California. <br /> <br />There, for about four years, he and his Essanay co-workers cranked out a huge number of films, mostly westerns.  They were not high art, but they were very entertaining.  Anderson became a big movie star due to his \\"Broncho Billy\\" character.  He became very rich.  He bought a legitimate theater, began promoting boxers, and was running the Niles baseball team.  By 1915 he had hired the biggest movie star of them all -- Charlie Chaplin. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the studio was closed in 1916.  Chaplin left for more money at Mutual, so Essanay's cash cow was gone.  Anderson seemed bored with the \\"Broncho Billy\\" films.  He only filmed a handful of films after this.  Essanay's management wanted to produce longer films in Chicago, not in California.  <br /> <br />This books is worth the price for the many, many beautiful and rare photos of Essanay films and photos of the studio in operation.  Author Kiehn has assembled an incredibly detailed filmography of all of Anderson's Essany films, and the Essany films made away from Chicago.  There is a comprehensive personnel list of everybody that ever worked for the studio.  But Kiehn's exhaustive research and his storytelling ability make this a fascinating book. <br /> <br />This book is a must-read for fans of silent films, Charlie Chaplin fans and western buffs.  You will not be disappointed.	2005-02-28

Wurtzel and the Early Fox Film Corporation: Letters, 1917-1923	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A peek into the messy inner workings of a movie studio	In 1917, William Fox hired Sol Wurtzel to run the west-coach branch of the Fox movie studios.  Fox was a demanding task-master, but he hated to leave New York.  He met with Wurtzel for one weekend, and then sent him off to Los Angeles.  You would think that a book consisting of a bunch of business letters and telegrams would be dry and boring, but that is certainly not the case.  Wurtzel immediately has to deal with employees who are stealing large amounts of film stock, an actress who skipped out of town with a salary advance, and uncooperative directors who spend the studio's money extravagantly.  Over and over, Fox browbeats Wurtzel for spending too much money and making lousy films.  Wurtzel fires back apologetic letters and telegrams defending himself. <br /> <br />One of the best things about the book is that you get to see how Wurtzel blossoms from a simple businessman to an artistic producer who really cares about his films.  If you've always wondered about what went on behind-the-scenes of a silent movie studio, ignore the clunky title and pick up this book.  How often to you get to read direct sources who tell things exactly how they happened 80+ years ago?	2004-11-20

She was the original \\"Biograph Girl\\" before Mary Pickford was given that name by movie fans.  After losing her job at Biograph, she was hired by Carl Laemmle's IMP company (later Universal).  As a publicity stunt, Laemmle started a rumor that she was dead.  Then she made a personal appearance in St. Louis and was mobbed by fans. <br /> <br />Unfortunately she was pretty much out of work in five years.  Poor managemet by her husband Harry, as well as a painful injury forced her into bit parts.  She was still acting in very small parts into 1938, when she gave up on life and committed suicide. <br /> <br />Kelly Brown has done an incredible research job.  Using Florence's surviving correspondence, as well as trade magazine artices and advertisements, she has reconstructed Florence's life.  The book has many footnotes noting sources, and there is a very detailed filmography.  Instead of a book full of dry facts, Ms. Brown keeps Florence's story interesting.  If you are interested in early cinema, or even important women actresses, you should definitely read this book.	2004-10-09

This book covers all of the short films that D.W. Griffith directed between January 1909 and June 1909.  At this point in his career, he was producing at least two films a week!  Of course some of them were made just to get a reel out the door, and others were small works of art that he really put his heart into.  As a general rule, these films are not as interesting as the Biograph films he made in 1912 and 1913, but there are still a few gems from this period, like THE LONELY VILLA and THE COUNTRY DOCTOR. <br /> <br />Each film entry includes credit information, a description from the \\"Biograph Bulletin\\", a story outline, and a critical commentary written by a film historian. The commentaries point out how Griffith was growing as a film-maker, as well as his struggles to learn the \\"language\\" of film editing.  The books in this series are required reading for anyone who really wants to know about Griffith's early career.	2004-09-15

DeMille to many serious film fans, and they might snicker. DeMille has a reputation for corny, big-budget epics like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS or THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH.  DeMille also has a reputation as a dictatorial director whose politics were extremely conservative. <br /> <br />DeMille was not really that simple of a person.  He made some very personal films, some really entertaining films, and even some daring films for the time.  Although he was politically conservative, several of his films preached the dangers of religious intolerance.  His battle with the Radio performer's union was a matter of principle, and not money. And while the stereotypical Hollywood director was modeled on him, part of it was an act.  DeMille had a great respect for his actors, as long as they were professional.  DeMille also had a sense of humor, as some of his cameo appearances in films show. <br /> <br />Robert Birchard has assembled an incredible history of DeMille's film and radio work.  DeMille was around during the birth of Paramount in 1915, and he was still a successful director all of the way through the 1950s.  Using DeMille's original papers, telegrams from studio moguls like Jesse Lasky, and other direct sources of information.  <br /> <br />You will read about DeMille's struggles with technical issues like poorly perforated film stock, cameramen, good and difficult actors, and pressure from management to get his films completed on time and under budget.  Mr. Birchard has viewed all of DeMille's films that still exist, and he gives a candid review of all of them.  The book also contains very detailed cast and crew listings, a list of DeMille's many cameo appearances, and everything is painstakingly documented in the end notes. <br /> <br />I can guarantee you that after reading this book, you will be very tempted to rent or buy a Cecil B. DeMille film and rediscover this master director yourself.	2004-08-20

THE GREAT DANE is a short study of the Great Northern Film Company (Nordisk) of Copenhagen, Denmark, and their film output of the early 1910s.  In the early 1900s, the only method of copyrighting a film in the United States was to deposit a paper print of the film with the Library of Congress.  This would hopefully prevent shady film distributors from copying your film and selling it as their own.  In 1912, Nordisk sent Ingval Oes to New York to act as an American distributor of their films.  Mr. Oes copyrighted 32 of these films in 1912 and 1913.  Of these, 16 paper prints survived.  This book has a short history of Nordisk, and then it contains credits and commentary of the surviving sixteen films.  It contains many illustrations from the paper prints themselves as well as film stills released by the studio. <br /> <br />Although Nordisk apparently is still around today, they didn't have much luck with the U.S. market when these films were first released.  Their films were three or four reels long when the American standard was one reel of 10 to 15 minutes.  The films are actually sophisticated in both film technique and sometimes storyline.  Unfortunately, there was a big anti-European bias in the American film markets, which also made these films a hard-sell.  When World War I broke out, Danish films lost both the European and American markets. <br /> <br />The only drawback with this book is that it does not cover the many Danish films from Nordisk that exist in European archives.  If you are interested in silent films, especially early silent films, you should definitely give this film a look.	2004-08-08

I have a few other of Mr. Slide's books, and they are full of useful information, just like this one.<br />This book has great profiles on a lot of lesser known, but still interesting actors and actresses.  Some of the profiles are several pages and are in-depth.  Others are a very short page or two.  Mr. Slide met more than half of the people profiled in the book.  For those people, he greatly comments on how these people treated him.  The book also documents their talkie careers, their career decline and their lives before their death.<br />The book does dish dirt on many prominent silent film people.  While some of it is certainly true and deserves to be public record, sometimes he speculates on things like sexual relationships that seem unlikely (Ralph Graves and Mack Sennett!).  Mr. Slide apparently finds it hard to believe that older women who live together can do so as friends not have a sexual relationship.<br />I don't know Mr. Slide, but he really lets his personality show through in this book.  For one thing, he does not have a sense of humor.  Of the comedians, he only wrote admiringly of Harold Lloyd and Alice Howell.  He has very poor opinions of Mabel Normand and John Bunny.  He says Bunny's comedy \\"contains<BR>nothing creative\\" and \\"one wonders if audiences ever did laugh at his work.\\" Chaplin, Keaton, Langdon, and Raymond Griffith are barely mentioned.  Laurel & Hardy and Charley Chase are ignored.  He talks of Arbuckle as if Roscoe really did rape and murder Virginia Rappe.<br />Mr Slide seems to remember everyone that made an anti-semetic remark to him. Surely people of this era were just as bigoted toward blacks and other ethnic groups. Yet D.W. Griffith is the only person (remembered by Blanche Sweet) remembered as making a racist remark, and that was before BOAN and INTOLERANCE. (At least he did say in the preface that he decided not to profile Patsy Ruth Miller because of her racist views and he usage of the n-word.<br />Mr. Slide seems obsessed with determining everyone's sexual orientation, and who had affairs with whom.  By the end of the book, you are almost disappointed if a person profiled just married once and didn't sleep with anybody else.  In the case of William Haines, J. Warren Kerrigan, Ramon Novarro (only mentioned in the book) and a few others, their sexuality certainly was an important part of their story and certainly affected their careers.  After \\"outing\\" so many people, I was actually surprised when he said that he had determined that George O'Brien is NOT bisexual.<br />Surely, just like the general population, silent actors got crotchety in their old age.  The best chapters are actually the ones where Slide spent a lot of time with the person, like Jetta Goudal (!) and Blanche Sweet.<br />Mr. Slide also calls anybody who does not agree with his political views \\"right-wing\\".  In an otherwise glowing profile on Lloyd, he calls THE CAT'S PAW (1934) \\"unfortunately right-wing\\". I'm not a conservative, yet his judgements of<BR>the subjects' political views are unusually harsh.<br />The most shocking line in the book to me was, \\"Nowhere is the tragedy of Clarine Seymour's death more pointed than here; if only she might have lived and [Carol] Dempster died, how much better would Griffith have fared in the coming decade.\\" While I agree that Dempster wasn't a very good actress, this is really some bizarre wish.<br />So anyway, it is a fun, fascinating read.  Having said that, Kevin Brownlow's books have better interviews with their subjects, and Eve Golden's GOLDEN IMAGES book has better profiles of obscure silent film stars.	2003-03-24

Griffith is famous (or infamous) for his breakthrough feature THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915), his critics are just as divided over his follow-up, INTOLERANCE (1916).  This epic tells four distinct stories at one time.  The stories are linked thematically, as they show how one powerful person's intolerance of others can have tragic results.  This film was the most expensive film produced up to that point in time, yet its structure remains \\"experimental\\" to this day.<br />Mr. Drew's analysis of this film is easy to read, and he does not indulge in some of the intangible film theories that many books of this type trot out.  He begins by sketching Griffith's life and his career at this point in time.  Next, he breaks the film down into the different \\"stories\\".  From that, he explores the sources that Griffith used as a reference for his story, costumes and sets.  This section is very interesting because the author points out the historical points that were important to Griffith as well as the facts he ignored. Griffith was also influenced by contemporary and historical authors, poets, and films.  Finally, Griffith and the film were influenced by the Progressive political reform movement of the time.<br />The last two chapters of the book deal with the impact of INTOLERANCE at the time of release, and what major film critics have said about it.  Griffith claimed that the film was a financial disaster.  While the film did not make a lot of money, Drew shows that the film did quite well until the outbreak of World War I caused a major shift in the public's attitues toward the film.<br />I would recommend this film to anybody who is interested in D.W. Griffith and silent films of the 1910s.  Just make sure that you see the film before reading the book.	2003-03-18

The Balboa studio gave Hollywood, California a run for its money in the 'teens.  Hundreds of short dramas, westerns, serials, and features were shot there.  Unfortunately, the studio was still expanding when a movie industry slowdown hit in 1918 due to World War I and the influenza epidemic.  It was soon out of business, and was torn down in the mid-1920s when the oil business took over Long Beach.<br />This book is very well researched, and it has a very detailed filmography of the studio at the end.  Several of the major stars of the era are profiled.<br />The book does have a couple of flaws though.  Sometimes the authors reprint press agent puffery that makes the studio and the stars seem more important than they really were.  Also, the authors relied on the book THE DEED OF DEATH for information on director William Desmond Taylor's murder.  Subsequent research has revealed that DEED OF DEATH has several important facts about Taylor and the murder wrong.<br />Still, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in silent film history or Long Beach, California history.	2003-03-04

Subjects range from clild actors Baby Peggy Montgomery and Jean Darling to major stars like Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and even a director, Andrew Stone.  The book has very detailed filmographies of each person profiled, except for director Stone.  This book is a fast read, and it would be a great introduction to someone who is new to silent films.  Many of the people profiled in the book had long careers in sound films also.  The best parts of the book are when he interviews some little know people like director Stone, actress Pauline Curley, and actress Priscilla Bonner and they actually talk about their careers and filmmaking.  Sometimes the subjects just give us a list of the many people that they worked with and don't give us much detail about their experiences.  In fairness to the author, his subjects were all very old at the time and may not have been able to remember that many details.  If you are really interested in interviews with silent film stars, Kevin Brownlow's THE PARADE'S GONE BY and William Drew's AT THE CENTER OF THE FRAME are much better.  Baby Peggy's story is told much better in hour autobiography, HOLLYWOOD' CHILDREN.	2003-02-07

French films were the most popular in the world until the War wiped out the film-making industry for a few years.  By then, the American film industry was the world leader. <br />Abel viewed hundreds of still-existing early films in writing this book.  The appendix includes a very useful filmography that lists existing French silent films, the archive that holds them, and lists contemporary magazine reviews of the films.  This book has very detailed endnotes of his sources. There are quite a few photos from the films that Abel describes.<br />The book is broken up into five parts.  The first part documents a history of the French film industry up to 1914, and the audiencies of the time.  The next section documents &quot;The Cinema of Attractions (1896-1904), when George Melies was the most popular filmmaker with his &quot;trick&quot; films.  Also, the Lumiere Brothers specialized in &quot;actuality&quot; films, and the Pathe company was growing.  The next section covers &quot;The Transition to a Narrative Cinema (1904-1907)&quot;, where short story films were king.  Pathe and Gaumont were the dominant film companies, and Melies was not popular much longer.  Next, &quot;The Pre-Feature Single-Reel Story Film&quot; documents the rise of comedies, historical films and even cartoons.  Finally, &quot;The Rise of the Feature Film (1911-1914) covers historical epics that were much longer, crime and detective films, and comedies featuring comedians like Max Linder and Andre Deed. The book also explains how both serious films and comedies both affirmed and satirized contemporary French society.<br />If you are new to the study of film history, this book will be way over your head.  On the other hand, if you are interested in the development of film narrative and editing, you will be fascinated by this book.  My only complaint is that Abel describes so many different examples of films, that it is tough to read a large chunk of this book at one sitting.  After an hour or so, all of the plot-lines and camera-work and editing that he describes starts to blur together in your mind.  I think that the book might have benefited from more section breaks.  Still, this is a fascinating book for the serious silent film fan.	2002-12-06

After covering the dangers of nitrate film and the wholesale junking of film prints during the silent era, he documents the beginning of the archive movement in the 1930s and 1940s.  You would think that the book would be filled with stories of heroic efforts to save films, but there are just as many stories of incompetent and egotistical administrators who did more damage than good.  The American Film Institute did a good job for a few years helping archives to preserve and restore films, but it quickly became a political organization and mostly claimed credit for projects that it had nothing to do with.  The book goes into detail into the &quot;colorization&quot; controversy, a process which thankfully has pretty much disappeared since this book was published in 1992.  There is also a section on how Scandinavian archives have done a much better job of preserving their countries' film heritage.  If you are a serious lover of silent films or the golden age of sound films, you will definitely want to read this book!	2002-07-08

Karl Brown worked for the Kinemacolor company as a teenager in the 1910s.  Just when this company went out of business, D.W. Griffith and his stock company arrived in Los Angeles.  He quickly became a camera assistant to cameraman Billy Bitzer.  He worked on Griffith's THE AVENGING CONSCIENCE, BIRTH OF A NATION, and INTOLERANCE, among other films. His book is funny, exciting, and informative.  He is in awe of Griffith and actress Lillian Gish.  He works his hardest to satisfy Griffith's demands on the job, but this sometimes makes Bitzer jealous of him.  Brown is confused by many of the things that Griffith does while making these films, but he soon learns why Griffith works this way.     The book also includes a chapter on Brown's stint in the Army during World War I, where he was given a one-week leave of absence to help Griffith with BROKEN BLOSSOMS.  This is the finest memoir by any silent film vetran that I've read, and I've read quite a few.	2002-06-27

The Patent litigation can be very confusing, but she does a good job of pointing out the important highlights.  Besides the Patent War, the Patents Company also lost the economic war with the independent film producers and distributors.  She describes the rise of the nickelodeon theatres, and the backlash against films by some moral \\"authorities\\" of the time. She shows many examples of films where the camera creeped closer to the actors than just a full shot of their body, and the early attempts to tell a story better by editing different shots together.  This period was the very beginning of the \\"star\\" system.  Many studios resisted releasing the names of their actors, but others (including a few licensed producers) were happy to do so.  With the coming of feature films came bigger, more elaborate movie palaces.  And although Hollywood started booming in this period, films were being made in New York City, New Jersey, Florida, San Antonio, Chicago, Ireland, Cuba, and many other places.<br />Because this book convers only American films, the reader will miss out on film history being made in Europe and the rest of the world.  However, it does explain how Italian spectacles in 1913-1914 influenced certain American filmmakers.  And Pathe Freres in France had some influence over distribution patterns in the USA before World War I.  The main reason that I didn't give this book 5 stars is that it only describes major films as to their editing techniques or social content.  There is no analysis as a whole of major films like THE ITALIAN, MUSKETEERS OF PIG ALLEY and others. Also, short comedies like the Mack Sennett Keystones only have a couple of pages, and Charlie Chaplin (who started working in 1914) and Sidney Drew barely have a mention.	2002-06-17

If you are really serious about your passion for silent films, this book is for you.  Mr Usai's concise book is packed full of research tips.  There are over 50 illustrations, many in color, of all kinds of different early film frames (70mm, 35mm, 9.5mm, 28mm) plus early color processes, even early 3-D frames.  He explains how the early color processes worked and how early films were assembled.  He goes into great detail on how that silent film that you may watch today may be drastically altered from the original in the early 1900s.  And he explains the many frustrating problems that silent film archivists encounter.  He explains the pitfalls of compiling filmographies, and how some printed sources are valuable and others are worthless.  If you are just becoming interested in silent films, this book will be too much for you.  But if you are really interested in the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of archive work, or the detective work that we do to study silent cinema, then you won't be able to put this book down!	2002-04-29

Some like Colleen Moore were huge stars; others were featured actresses that worked steadily through the era. While their stories are not quite as in-depth as Kevin Brownlow's THE PARADE'S GONE BY, Mr. Drew conducted his interviews about 20 years later than Mr. Brownlow and his actresses memories may not have been as sharp.  Most of them come across as very intelligent.  What is surprising is that most of them had no idea of what they were doing when they first started acting, but they were seasoned professionals when they retired.  Only Madge Bellamy, the first subject comes across as a little shallow.  If you are a silent film fan and you read this book, you will definitely want to see some films by Colleen Moore, Lois Wilson, Esther Ralston and others.  Highly recommended.	2002-04-09

Still, I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.  The problem is that it attempts to cover everything that happened from the beginning of film until 1929.  If you are already familiar with silent films, there will only be a few pages of information in this book that will be new to you.  The rest will feel like an overview.  If you are new to silent films, this book covers so much that it does not go into much detail on any topic.  This may not be enough to get a person just becoming interested in silent films to learn more about the subject.  And although the book tries to cover everything, Japanses silent films are barely mentioned.  Other film industries like India's are not mentioned at all.  To the author's credit, he did do his research and I did not notice any factual errors.  If you are a silent film fan, you might be interested in this book, but there are others out there that are far more interesting.	2002-04-09

Russell Merritt and J.B. Kaufman have done an incredible job of documenting this little-known part of Disney's career.  This book is also packed with storyboards, pencil sketches, scripts, and production photos from these cartoons.  There is a very detailed filmography of all of Disney's cartoons from 1921 through 1929.<br />The first chapter is an analysis of these cartoons -- what was better than the competition (Felix the Cat), or not as good.  They explain how the animated characters evolved from just moving figures into \\"character animation.\\"  Next, the historic detail from each period is described in a chapter each on the LAUGH-O-GRAMS, the Alice cartoons, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and the beginnings of Mickey Mouse.  The authors go into great detail on the working methods of the animators, and Disney's business and distribution problems.  Believe it or not, Mickey Mouse might never have happened if producer Charles Mintz had not pulled Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and most of Disney's animators away from him in a needless \\"power play\\".  Highly recommended for silent film enthusiasts.	2002-02-06

Of all of his films, only THE MERRY WIDOW survives in a form that is close to what he wanted.  Yet this film is the least representative of his films.  He was probably fired from more movies that anybody else in Hollywood.  Yet producers recognized that he was an artistic genius and they kept him employed for over a decade.  Von Stroheim gave his critics plenty of rope to hang himself, as he worked his crews incredibly long hours and he busted the budget of almost every movie that he filmed.  Still, it is sad that Fox producer Sol Wurtzel killed any chances Von Stroheim had in sound films by re-shooting most of his last film, WALKING DOWN BROADWAY.<br />Almost every film Von Stroheim made is now considered a classic, such as BLIND HUSBANDS and GREED.  In the sound era, he had many of memorable supporting roles as an actor in films like THE GREAT GABBO, THE GRAND ILLUSION, SUNSET BOULEVARD, and FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO.<br />I alreay have the earlier incarnation of this book THE MAN YOU LOVED TO HATE.  I was glad that I bought this updated version, because there is a lot of new information in it.  If you are interested in silent film history, you will love this biography.	2002-01-30

Some like Clara Bow, William Haines, and Rudolph Valentino have been covered more in-depth by other biographers.  However, there is no other book that covers the life and careers of Marie Prevost, Milton Sills, Arthur Johnson, Clarine Seymour, Harrison Ford (not Indiana Jones), Pearl White, and Wallace Reid.  Even famous personalities who just made a few film appearances like May Irwin and Ormer Locklear are covered.  Many of these performers died before the silent era was even over, which is why they are virtually unknown today.  These essays were originally written for CLASSIC IMAGES magazine, but have been updated for the book.  Ms. Golden's bios are well researched and very easy to read.

He is most famous for A TRIP TO THE MOON (1902).  Elizabeth Ezra's book tries to burst three myths about Melies.  1.  Melies only made &quot;fairy&quot; films and childlike fantasies.  2. Melies' style was just theatrical, with little cinematic effects.  3. Melies' films lack narrative structure and can't be analyzed using film theory.  She does a good job showing how these myths aren't always true.  However, the book sometimes reads more like a graduate thesis.  While she does a good job of analyzing some of Melies more prominent films, she sometimes over-analyzes the films.  The book has a  short history of Melies' life, and has a filmography of all of his existing films.  This book is a good introduction to Melies for film students, but serious silent film buffs will be disappointed that the book does not cover Melies career in more detail.	2001-10-21

He covers early unsuccessful sound-film attempts, some of the last great silent film classics like THE CROWD and SUNRISE, Warners' and Fox's different sound systems, and many other topics.  The main scope of the book is the period from 1926-1930.  The focus of the book is on how the business of filmmaking and the art of filmmaking was completely changed with the coming of the talking movie.  Careers were born and destroyed overnight.  Sometimes a performer's voice was a problem in sound films.  In other cases, like John Gilbert's, the studio thought that he was too expensive and the type of film that was his forte became passe.  For a couple of years, the sound-man was the most important person on a movie set.<br />Eyeman's book is comprehensive, but not comprehensive enough.  Curiously, he gives short shrift to some comedians like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Raymond Griffith.  Except for a brief mention of the British change-over, the book focuses exclusively on Hollywood studios.  He covers all of the bases such as legal wrangling over patents, financial profits and losses, the problems that studio artists encountered in making sound films, and the many poor films that were produced in the early sound era. If you like classic films, you will love this book.	2001-10-10

I have always thought that Miss Gish was a great performer and one of the most beautiful actresses ever, but it turns out she was a pretty smart cookie (except in the romance department) and lead a very interesting life.  <br />Book reviewer Richard Schickel has given this book a bad review.  He is all hot and bothered in that Gish was not very truthful about her life (like umpteen other famous movie stars) and he apparently doesn't like her &quot;proper&quot;, chaste, Victorian-era image.  The author, Charles Affron, had access to many of her personal papers, including may personal letters that she wrote.  While Affron may knock her off her pedestal a little bit, it is only because she was a real person who sometimes made mistakes.<br />Gish fibbed about all kinds of things like her birthdate, her engagement, and the cause of her mother's stroke.  The famed &quot;happy&quot; ending of THE WIND was actually in Francis Marion's script, not a late addition forced by the studio like Gish claimed so much later.  She chose to &quot;forget&quot; or not mention all kind of things like her personal relationship with D.W. Griffith (which was probably not sexual anyway) and the fact that she didn't always get along with her sister Dorothy.<br />Gish's image (which was still close to her actual personality, even if some of the details were not true) really hurt her in the 1920's when the fan magazines turned against her and MGM didn't know what kind of vehicle would be right for her.<br />She seems to have been the only woman (or person) who could stand up to Griffith when it came to artistic decisions.  She certainly was an artistic force to be reckoned with, and the loss of her lone direction credit REMODELING HER HUSBAND (1920) seems worse now that I have read the book.<br />The only disappointment for me was that Affron did not spend as much time analyzing her films as he should have.  While other reviewers have complained that Affron unfairly criticizes Gish for being a Victorian and a Republican, I do not feel that his comments about BIRTH OF A NATION and her politics are unwarranted.<br />If you are interested in Lillian Gish, D.W. Griffith, and silent films in general, this book is highly recommended.	2001-04-18

Riley starts with the story of the Paris Opera house, Gaston LeRoux, and the novel.  Then he follows the complicated production, with problems over Lon Chaney's participation, many rewrites, previews, and re-edited versions.  When sound films came along, it was re-cut and opera sequences were added.  This book has reprinted the entire pressbook, the original script, plus sections of the different script versions.  Riley interviewed heroine Mary Philbin and several of the technical crew-members for this book.  If you are a fan of Lon Chaney Sr., you will want this book.	2001-03-13

McCaffrey walks the reader through the different portions of each film such as the exposition and climax.  He shows how Lloyd develops sight gags and how the latter two films are better than GRANDMA'S BOY.  This book also covers Lloyd's early and later career.  An appendix of the book includes the author's conversations with Lloyd about Lloyd's career.  This book is a &quot;must-have&quot; for Harold Lloyd fans and readers interested in how silent film comedy works.	2001-03-13

This great book will illustrates the life of both Charley (Parrott) Chase and his brother James Parrott.  Their lives were intertwined, and when one of them had problems it certainly affected the other.  While Chase always had a jolly face on, this book illustrates both his triumphs and his failures.  Chase worked with many great comics like Charlie Chaplin, Roscoe Arbuckle, Laurel &amp; Hardy, Thelma Todd and the Three Stooges.  Chase also directed and/or supervised many good comedies where he did not appear on-screen.  There is a very detailed filmography (and musicography) in the back that includes the lyrics to many of the songs that Charley wrote, his many directing credits, and other film appearances.  Sure this book is expensive, but if you love silent comedy or early sound shorts you will not be able to stop reading it.	2001-01-05

By color, I mean two-strip technicolor, tinted, toned, or hand-stenciled color.  This is a frustrating book for a couple of reasons.  One reason is that the participants keep referring to specific scenes in a film.  While there are about 20 beautifully reproduced color frames in the book, the reader can't exactly follow along the film by looking at the photos.  Also, this book is basically a group discussion.  One participant will propose a theory as to how color was used by filmmakers, or how it was perceived by audiences.  Then another participant will completely rebut the theory, leaving the reader to wonder if we know anything at all about how color was used in silent film.<br />There is a wealth of information on the different color processes and the difficulty in preserving and restoring them.  Since this is a group discussion, there is not a specific section covering this topic.  Neither is there an index.  Still, I would recommend this book for anyone interested in restoring and preserving classic films from the silent era.	2000-10-03

He originally was a one-person operation, but at his  company's height he had several groups of people touring the eastern half  of the United States exhibiting films.  At first he showed films any place  that he could book.  With the rise of the nickelodeon, he began to  specialize in 'educational' and news film shows at churches, YMCAs, and  civic centers.  His shows featured sound effects, music, and color tinting  whenever possible.  He also began to produce a few films himself.<br />This  book is an interesting look at the struggles and triumphs of an independent  showman.  It is very well researched. However, the exhibition side of the  business is not quite as engrossing of a story as the production side.   This book is also expensive.  If you are not really interested in the  exhibition side of the movie business it may not be worth the money you  spent on it.	2000-08-14

The Triangle Corporation was announced with great fanfare in 1915.  Three giants of the film industry, D.W. Griffith, Thomas Ince, and Mack Sennett would form a corporation that would supply theatres with the best films  available.  From an auspicious beginning, the company was already in  trouble after one year.  It somehow survived until about 1920, mostly by  re-issuing its old films and producing cheap programmers.  This book is the  story of Harry Aitken, whose vision created the company.  His mismanagement  and out-right fraud ended up destroying the company.  Author Lahue has done  a great job researching this long-defunct company.  My only criticism is  that the author uses a little dramatic license to get inside several of the  subjects heads to tell us what they were thinking.  Overall, an excellent  book for anyone interested in silent film history.	2000-03-08

Mr. Genini has done an admirable job of digging up old magazine and newspaper articles about Ms. Bara.  He even interviewed Bara's  dentist.  However, this book is not nearly as good as Eve Golden's VAMP  book on Bara, which was printed the same year.  This book has many great  publicity photos, but few stills from her films.  The book spends little  time in describing Bara's films.<br />The author only viewed Bara's first  starring film A FOOL THERE WAS (1914).  He doesn't mention until nearly the  end of the book that most of Bara's films are missing.  However, he  overlooked some of the few films that do survive.  THE UNCHASTENED WOMAN  (1925) has been available on the collector's market for years and EASY  LYNNE is available in an archive.  He also incorrectly states that MADAME  MYSTERY (1926), her last film, is complete -- actually a one-reel  albrigement is all that survives.  [THE STAIN (1914) was discovered after  this book was written].<br />If you are a big Theda Bara fan, by all means get  this book.

Over half of the book is taken up  with a listing of silent feature films (and a few shorts) that are  available on video.  If you are looking for a rare silent video, this is a  great reference book.  Addresses and phone numbers of silent film video  distributors are listed in an appendix.   The book has a few drawbacks.   While Klepper does praise video companies like Kino, he doesn't say  anything bad about companies that produce unwatchable tapes other than to  say that tapes under $10 are usually of poor quality.  He doesn't mention  anything about whether or not a film is still under copyright or whether  the video company went to the trouble to legally sell the video.  And a few  of the short blurbs at the back are a little off. Raymond Griffith's PATHS  TO PARADISE (1925) is listed as a &quot;crime drama&quot; instead of a  &quot;caper comedy&quot;.	1999-10-25

Chased out of New York by cold weather, they spent 1911 filming westerns around the San Antonio missions.   Although almost all of these films are lost, author Thompson has documented  storylines and reviews of all of the productions filmed there, including  the first ever movie about the Alamo.  Definitely a must-have book for fans  of early silent film.	1999-10-15

As always, Brownlow's observations  on the films are excellent.  Many of the films reviewed here not available  for viewing on video.  A must-have book for fans of silent cinema.	1999-10-15

Ms. Hanson has certainly done her research, but her prose is barely understandable because she uses many words that are unfamiliar to the common reader and her sentences are a mile long.  This  book is only for hard-core fans of D.W. Griffith's Intolerance and Rudolph  Valentino.  Be warned, you will need help staying awake while you read  it...	1999-06-25

This book really concentrates on her relationships with her husbands Owen Moore; Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.;  and Buddy Rogers.  It is also thorough in covering her family of Charlotte,  Jack, and Lottie.  My only disappointment was that the not much of the  actual making of her films was covered in-depth.  The book has a perfect  title, as she was probably the most powerful person in Hollywood from about  1915 until the coming of sound.	1999-03-22

In the 1910's the movie studios made many films that dealt with the relationship between management and workers.  In the 1920's, a combination  of lack of funds, censors and powerful movie studios combined to restrict  stories of class conflict from the screen. This book explores one-reel  melodramas by D.W. Griffith, comedies by Charlie Chaplin that ridicule  people in authority, the &quot;Red Scare&quot; films from after World War  I, and the films produced by labor activists themselves.  It shows how many  films used stereotypes of violent strikers that were not realistic.  By  necessity, this book is sympathetic to labor unions, but that does not  interfere with the author's analysis of his subject.	1999-01-21

Each film entry has credits, a sypnosis, commentary,  and comtemporary reviews.  Also included are newsreel appearances and  erroneous film credits.  The commentary is very good.  This book's only bad  point is that the editing is very poor.  There are numerous misspelled  words and grammatical errors like fragmentary sentences.  This book is a  must-have for fans of Laurel &amp; Hardy.	1998-12-30

The bulk of this book was actually written by film historian William K. Everson, with Joe Franklin  contributing very little to it.  In the 1960's, when there were few books  about the silent era available, this book was the best to be found.  Things  have greatly changed since, with many more silent films being rediscovered,  and much more scholarship being done on the period.  If the authors  re-wrote the book today, the list of best films and performers would be  somewhat different.  Regardless, this is the perfect book for someone who  knows little about American silent films from 1900-1931 and needs an good  introduction.	1998-12-30

Frank Thompson has re-edited some interviews with silent-film director  Henry King into chronological order.  King talks of his days as an actor,  and then a silent film director.  In the 1930's he moved to the Fox studios  and directed many good films (including some classics such as THE  GUNFIGHTER [1950]).  King talks about Daryl Zanuck (the mogul at Fox) and  many film stars such as Lillian Gish, Ronald Coleman, Gary Cooper, and  Gregory Peck.  The book has an excellent filmography in the back, plus a  few pictures of King throughout the years.	1998-09-18

Silent film historian Kevin Brownlow documents the silent film newsreel and documentary cameramen who traveled to the far ends of the earth and risked their lives to record history.  &quot;The War&quot; concerns films about World War I and America's and Britian's involvment in it.  My only complaint here is that the book does not cover more of the war and &quot;Hun&quot; fictional films that came out during the war.  There is a large-section on anti-war and preparedness films that appeared before America entered the war. The second section deals with western films.  There are sections on movie cowboys like William S. Hart and Tom Mix, as well as actual outlaws and cowboys who appeared in early films.  The last section concerns &quot;nature&quot; and exploration films.  While some might feel that the large subject-matter covered by this book keeps it meandering from one topic to another, it is still a great book about silent film history.	1998-07-31

There are many never-before seen pictures of Ms. Bara's films.  A great introduction to one of the silent film era's biggest movie stars.	1998-07-31

Fields.  The first half chronicles the now-forgotten world of vaudeville and Fields' various world tours.  This book dispels many of the myths contained in Robert Lewis Taylor's bio from the 1940's.  Louvish shows how Fields' vaudville routines influenced his Broadway shows, and how these later turned up in his silent and sound films and even his press releases.  While the book concentrates Fields' life more than his stage appearances, some films like the lost TWO FLAMING YOUTHS, are studied in depth.	1998-06-26
