I can only think that the reviewers who keep calling Stapledon's novels works of \\"philosophy\\" have never actually read any philosophy.<br />Philosophical treatises vary according to the philosopher, of course. Nietsche's \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\", \\"The Birth of Tragedy\\", and \\"The Case of Wagner\\" are all much more eccentric and seemingly glib than Satre's more rigorous \\"Being and Nothingness\\", \\"Search for a Method\\", and the essays in his \\"Between Marxism and Existentialism\\". Camus in \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\" falls somewhere in between.  (So much for proto and post existentialism.)<br />In any case, a philosophical novel typically involves a scene or a series of scenes such as that in \\"Brave New World\\" in which the Savage and his two friends are confronted by the World Controller. In other words, various characters sit around and argue. The novelist with a philosophical bent typically finds it necessary or convenient to make different characters espouse different contending points of view. Stapledon doesn't do this, and not because he is more subtle than Aldous Huxley-he is much less subtle in fact-but because his \\"novels\\" are not so much works of \\"philosophy\\" as tracts.	2004-07-20

If you're not interested in computer programming, you should be able to follow it easily, but its virtues won't outweigh its flaws for you.<br />I liked the bug best--the actual bug as explained, that is. Like some of the reviewers I'm a little sceptical that such a thing might go so long undetected, but so what? It's fun; it makes a point; and, anyway, close enough.<br />Essentially, however, this novel is not plot driven; essentially it's a character (psychological) study, one that requires more skill than this first-time novelist can muster. Literary ambition alone doesn't suffice.<br />About the prose: There are great swaths of sentence fragments. The author seems to think they lend an immediacy to the thing. I think they make it clumsy and cheap. I object (also) in particular to<br />1) the phrase &quot;waiting on&quot; to mean &quot;waiting for&quot; (only restaurant workers wait &quot;on&quot;, and &quot;on&quot; is not an all-purpose preposition), to<br />2) the phrase &quot;Noam Chomsky famously said...&quot; (&quot;famously&quot; here--and everywhere--is superfluous and ugly; you can't indiscriminately add &quot;ly&quot; to every adjective you chance upon), and to<br />3) &quot;academic&quot; used as a noun (just say &quot;college teacher&quot; or something, if that's what you mean).	2004-01-16

Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; (a science-fiction novel from an author who mainly wrote non-science-fiction), published within a few years of &quot;The First and Last Men&quot;, is infinitely more telling, trenchant, and philosophically compelling.	2003-10-30

It makes no sense (other than business sense) to retitle it &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot;. It is no more about or by Hilary du Pre than it is by or about Piers du Pre. It is especially absurd to put photographs of ACTORS on the front and back cover.<br />2) The amazon.com amateur &quot;reviewers&quot; who have abused this opportunity so as to hurl invective at Jackie or her family remind me of the strangers depicted in the book who send letters to Jackie and say such hurtful things as her conversion to Judaism is responsible for her multiple sclerosis. The authors are telling you what happened; they are not asking you to pass judgement. (For that matter, nonsensical psychobabble buzzwords such as &quot;dysfunctional&quot; and &quot;enabler&quot; should be expunged from the language.)<br />Ad rem: In the main, this a gripping and surprisingly well-written story, considering that neither of the authors are professional writers. Don't get that idea, however, that it is in any way comparable to something like Hemingway's &quot;A Movable Feast&quot;; it isn't nearly THAT well written. Hilary does a better job than Piers, lapsing into banality significantly less often. Piers is better at describing Jackie than his life apart from her. We never catch his supposed enthusiasm for flying. His stilted account of his religious awakening seems wholly gratuitous and artificial.<br />Considering that there is scarcely a whiff of didacticism in these pages, it is surprising that you end up learning so much of trenchant value about music, en passant, as it were.	2003-10-04

Clarke, Ray Bradbury, and Fred Hoyle. Yes, Fred Hoyle WAS widely recognized as one of the three best living science-fiction writers working in the English language (not a particularly great distinction, however). <br />Isaac Asimov was right behind, and Robert Heinlein's reputation was rising. (Heinlein had published a quantity of B science fiction, but was more or less redeeming himself.) <br />Philip K. Dick, on the other hand, was widely regarded as strictly a B science fiction writer, and rightly so. William Gibson hadn't yet published anything. H. G. Wells was considered a classic writer whose works transcended the genre, much superior to any living science-fiction writers except Stanislaw Lem, who was little known to English-speaking readers.<br />Fred Hoyle, like Isaac Asimov, was an eminent scientist as well as a science-fiction writer. Again like Isaac Asimov, he was also well known as a scientific popularizer. It is interesting that much of his science was very like science-fiction: unsubstantiated conjecture. He was still a staunch proponent of his own \\"solid state\\" theory of the universe long after it had been thoroughly discredited. (He coined the pejorative term \\"big bang\\" to disparage a competing theory. The term caught on; the disparagement did not.) Later he began promulgating the fantastic notion that life on earth was inaugurated by space spores. <br />Nearly all of Fred Hoyle's science-fiction is entertaining. None of it has literary value. I regard \\"October the First is Too Late\\" as very easily his best novel because 1) it happens to be especially entertaining and 2) its social criticism and philosophical speculation is trenchant. It deserves to come back into print.	2003-10-04

Its great swaths of seemingly interminable lists may try a reader's patience; they will not exercise his mind. <br />It helps a bit if you've studied French, but if you haven't you won't miss much. Similarly, toward the beginning we are confronted with the source code in the BASIC computer language for a small, crude, inelegant permutation algorithm. If you know BASIC, you'll immediately recognize how the algorithm works; if you don't know BASIC, it doesn't matter; the algorithm has nothing to do with the story. A more, shall we say, seasoned writer would have omitted it.<br />Let's cut to the chase. What is this bloated tome saying? It's saying that people have a tendency to see connections among unconnected things. It doesn't tell us why that is or shed any particular light on that tendency in any way. If the subject interests you, I suggest you read Carl Sagan's &quot;The Dragons of Eden&quot;. &quot;The Dragons of Eden&quot; does tell us why that is, and it tells us how we can guard against it. (&quot;The Dragons of Eden&quot; is also much better written, more engaging, and more intellectually stimulating than &quot;Foucalt's Pendulum&quot;.)<br />Why is &quot;Foucalt's Pendulum&quot; saying this? Possibly because its author, a structuralist, wants to satirize the philological contention that connotation and etymology matter. If so, he is presenting us with a grotesque caricature of a straw man.<br />What is the moral? In general, don't tempt fate. In particular, don't associate with grisly, squalid, thoroughly repulsive satanic cults. But you knew that already --I hope.	2003-09-18

It reports events (Benny Goodman meeting Ringo Starr of the Beatles, for example) the author was not even a witness to.

About nine-tenths of this comes directly from Oscar Levant's three memoirs. That doesn't make it plagiarism, I suppose, since the \\"derivation\\", to put it charitably, is more or less (less, actually) acknowledged. It does make it copying someone else's biographies. (An AUTObiography is, after all, a biography.) It also makes reading this a chore for anyone interested enough in the subject to want to get the story from the horse's mouth. (And if you aren't that interested even, WHY are you bothering with THIS?) I deduct three stars.<br />I deduct a fourth star for this book's abuse of the English language with solecisms such as \\"germophobe\\" and \\"homophobe\\". (If \\"homophobe\\" were a word it would mean \\"clinical fear of sameness\\". The author wants it to mean misohomosexualism, hatred of homosexuals, -- someone I know maintains that \\"homophobe\\" is no worse than \\"chocoholic\\", which is rather like saying that Attila the Hun was no worse than Adolf Hitler.) <br />I deduct a fifth star for its politically correct pseudo-psychological speculation. It proffers the theory that Oscar Levant remarked upon the libretto of covertly homosexual minor composer Marc Blitzstein's heavy-handed socialist opera \\"The Cradle Will Rock\\"'s  \\"pseudo virility\\" (Levant's phrase) in order to mask Levant's supposed homosexual attraction to George Gershwin. Au contraire, mon frere: 1) Marc Blitzstein did not even WRITE this opera's libretto; he only wrote its music, and Levant PRAISED its music. 2) Levant's assessment of this opera happens to adhere closely to the critical consensus. 3) There is no evidence whatsoever that Levant had any homosexual tendencies, and it is absurd and perverse to suggest that Levant's obvious, though severely qualified, admiration for Gershwin the man, in contradistinction to his even more obvious, and much less qualified, admiration for Gershwin the musician, constitutes evidence.<br />On the other hand, \\"A Talent for Genius\\" is an intriguing title. Too bad the authors never explain what they mean by it.<br />In any case, don't even consider this until you're read \\"A Smattering of Ignorance\\", \\"Memoirs of an Amnesiac\\", and \\"The Unimportance of Being Oscar\\", and then just skim it to try to find its scant new material -- or pass it by completely.

This is NOT one of Milan Kundera's best three novels; it is nevertheless a VERY GOOD novel (or story or novella or whatever you wish to call it). (It is possible that the fame of \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\" has caused \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\" to be read by some unable to appreciate it who nevertheless feel constrained to say they like it.) \\"Ignorance\\" is like \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" and \\"Gigi\\" AT LEAST in that all three are short, and if one contends that length in and of itself (getting your money's worth in black ink) is a value then one should for the sake of consistency deride \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" and \\"Gigi\\" as much as \\"Ignorance.\\" Judging a work in its own terms means not faulting \\"Ignorance\\" for neglecting to describe the physical appearance of its characters where that would be irrelevant (as Kundera, and Kafka too, characteristically do not) and not faulting Milan Kundera from commenting on his own characters and story (for \\"showing, not telling\\") -- which he does to a significantly greater extent in \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\\", by the way.

It is not concerned with evil-genius super-crooks and science-fiction gadgetry; it is not a cops-and-robbers concoction. You may prefer super-crooks, etc., but as far as your review is concerned, that is neither here nor there.<br />\\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is hard-boiled fiction. You may prefer Agatha Christie to Dashiell Hammett, Fitzgerald to Hemingway; you may prefer \\"colorful\\" characters and settings, but that's you.<br />\\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is not and does not purport to be \\"realistic\\". It is genre-fiction (not \\"literature\\") just realistic enough to draw you into its web. (In his introduction to \\"The Looking-Glass War\\", the author himself makes this point clearly and, one might say, vehemently.) \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is plot-driven, not character-driven. Essentially, in fact, it's a small puzzle for you to work out. (The solution is given.) Only readers who enjoy working out puzzles, readers who like to think, need apply.<br />With the possible exception of \\"The Russia House\\" (which I also heartily recommend), \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is John Le Carre's best spy novel (he has also published detective stories and non-genre fiction), and the best he is likely ever to write.

Those who call this a \\"book [that] defines the irrational and dangerous gulf that divides our artistic-intellectual community from our scientific\\" or a \\"classic book [that] talks about and tries to promote cooperation between these 'two cultures'\\" have read maybe its first few pages or maybe the flap. It was \\"controversial\\" in the way that a high, slow lob in volleyball is \\"controversial\\": it's just asking to be spiked. For it gratuitously attacks pretty much the whole of nineteenth and (early-to-mid) twentieth century literature and is replete with large and obvious errors. In other words, it encourages the enmity of those who can easily vanquish it; it's a 98-pound weakling going about kicking sand into the faces of body builders. I'm not a body builder, so to speak, but even I can answer it thus:<br />1) We are told (repeatedly) that pre-industrialized life was an unrelentedly awful thing due to the high rate of infant mortality as well as to the circumstance that life expectancy was much lower. In fact, life expectancy was much lower (than in 1958 when this book was published first) ONLY if you average in INFANT MORTALITY. Nobody died of old age at forty. Moreover, it certainly was NOT the whole kit and caboodle of industrialization that eventually lowered the rate of infant mortality, as this book reflexively assumes.<br />2) We are told that factory work during the industrial revolution must have been better than agricultural work before the industrial revolution since so many people left the farm to work in factories. This is tautology. For one thing, farms were not the only source of factory fodder. Factory mass-production of goods made family businesses economically untenable, and formerly proud craftsmmen were FORCED by these NEW economic conditions either to work in factories or starve, to work much longer hours for much less pay in unsafe conditions.<br />3) We are told that praising any aspect of the pre-industrialized world is \\"myth-making\\" since if you had lived then chances are you'd have been a peasant. Well, we can easily turn this around: Chances are an inhabitant of the pre-industrialized era, had he lived after the industrial revolution would have been a factory worker -- rather than, for example, a famous novelist. (If you think you'd prefer factory work to agricultural peasant work, I invite you to take a job at Rockford Products in Rockford, Illinois. I think you'll change your tune pretty quickly.)<br />Understand me: It may very well be that on the whole we are better off now than we were then, but we will be better off still when we begin to examince critically the consequences of technological change, the consequences direct and indirect, physical, environmental, physiological, psychological, social, and cultural. We will be better off when we begin to assume responsibility for the consequences of the technological changes we effect, implement, and allow. Rah, rah propaganda such as we find in \\"The Two Cultures\\" is counterproductive.	2002-06-04

The author refers to himself as \\"a professional performer of amateur music\\" with a certain irony, but none of the contradictions inherent in his conception the form are really addressed. The author makes it clear he wants the form and a doctrinaire politics intimately and inextricably associated but offers no substantial defense for this posture. <br /> In an early eighties interview in Rolling Stone, Bob Dylan relates how he went to see someone billed as a folk singer and complained to his companion, \\"That's not a folk singer, a folk singer sings folk songs, not songs he made up himself.\\" <br />His companion answered, \\"Well, you started that, didn't you?\\"<br />&quot;Yes, I suppose,&quot; Dylan said, \\"but I would never have done it if I hadn't sung the folk songs first.\\"<br />Pete Seeger in the introduction to an early nineties edition of this book voices a similar complaint, that nowadays by folk singer we often mean someone who sings pop songs and accompanies himself on an acoustic guitar. There is something silly about this, certainly, but there is also something silly about Pete Seeger's idea of a folk singer. 1) Note that the steel string acoustic guitar, the instrument of choice for these \\"folk singers\\" was not generally available until the 1920's, when practical designs were marketed to be used in dance bands because gut (now nylon) string guitars weren't loud enough. In other words the steel string acoustic guitar is essentially a pop instrument, not a folk instrument. 2) Note that it would be impossible to conceive of chordal accompaniment in the way these \\"folk singers\\" conceive of it without the theory of Jean-Philippe Rameau. Only monophony, heterophony, and vestigial polyphonic (particularly drone) accompaniments are really authentic.	2002-05-10

Let's start with the title: Yes, it's glib and not quite accurate, but it's also very catchy. At least it caught MY attention. And I'm very sorry, but it seems to me that \\"Why People Have Contradictory Belief Systems\\" would be a much worse title for this--or any book. Not just because \\"Why People Have Contradictory Belief Systems\\" is ungainly and stodgy, but also because, for example, many delusions are perfectly self-consistent and still utterly false--and dangerous. What we are concerned with here, and rightly so, is not so much consistency but correspondence with reality. Both \\"creationism\\" and Ayn-Rand-ism, so to speak, have in common a refusal to consider empirical evidence. The scientific method, on the other hand, requires that suppositions be testable and be tested. I wouldn't pick on \\"creationism\\" were it content to consider itself a matter of religious doctrine (after all, much religious doctrine is supremely \\"weird\\"). It isn't.  It demands that we take it for a contending scientific theory.  I wouldn't pick on Ayn-Rand-ism were it content to consider itself a matter of philosophical speculation (after all, much philosophical speculation is supremely \\"weird\\"). It isn't.  It conspires to take control of public policy, art, science, government, and pretty much anything and everything it can possibly get its paws on.<br />But ad rem: I don't mind the glibness in this book's title, but I do mind the glibness in its content, and I don't find it especially well written, incisive, or insightful. Like others before me, I recommend you read instead Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark\\". But also read Carl Sagan's \\"The Dragons of Eden\\" to understand deluded self-consistent pattern-making, and Carl Sagan's essay on ancient Greek thought in \\"Cosmos\\" to understand the value of empirical evidence. One more recommendation: Richard Feynman us how to go about collecting empirical evidence in his essay &quot;Cargo Cult Science&quot;, whichappears in both &quot;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman&quot; and &quot;The Pleasure of Finding Things Out: The Best Short Works of Richard P. Feynman&quot;.	2002-04-26

The argumentum ad hominem (and thus logically invalid) attacks in three of the reviews below are rather disconcerting. For the record (nevertheless): It happens I have a Master's degree in Music Theory; it happens I scored a high 99% on the Music Subject Test of the GRE; it happens I have taught college level music theory professionally. I think I have some (this is understatement) &quot;competence&quot; in music theory. I do not, nor do any of the reviews below, say that the book in question is useless. I say it is unsuitable for freshman and sophomore classroom instruction and also for self-instruction except as a supplement. It is nevertheless an interesting and quirky artifact, and I do recommend it for persons interested in quirky artifacts who have already acquired a basic understanding of the rudiments of music theory. It is only fair to point out, however, that in doing so I am not recommending it for the use for which it was clearly intended, and it is only fair that my star-rating reflect this.	2001-10-31

I never understood how he could hold to such a [sic] irrational philosphy [sic] and yet push critical thinking on everyone (See Demon-haunted world). His best contradiction was proclaiming design and complexity in the universe, yet denying the need for a designer. He seemed to forget logic states 'chance' has no power and that the Big Bang logically points to the need for a transcendent creator.&quot;<br />Sorry, the teleological argument for the existence of God was categorically refuted centuries ago. Today no reputable theologian or philosopher (a fortiori, SCIENTIST) entertains it seriously. The above criticism of PALE BLUE DOT has absolutely no merit whatsoever. It is hardly worth the time it takes to dismiss it. So let's move on:<br />PALE BLUE DOT is a lovely and important book. All I can say against it is that it makes me sad its author is no longer among us. We are all the poorer for that.	2001-10-31

It keeps us turning pages and implicitly critiques Connie Willis's poorly executed THE DOOMSDAY BOOK. For my money, it ought to have tried to do at least a little more, though. Even the incessant action-adventure eventually becomes wearying. <br />This is the first novel I've read that comes with a bibliography. I would have given it an extra star for this circumstance--it charmed and amused me--except that on this bibliography's recommendation I read the book from which TIMELINE took its (pseudo-scientific) explanation of time travel, THE FABRIC OF REALITY. Let's just say it ought to have occurred to me that a book that calls itself &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot; is likely to be only loosely connected to it.	2001-09-26

The prime agent of the obstacles that make this move forward at all is the mysterious disappearance of a certain Dr. Basingame. Readers with even the slightest sense of plot structure will feel cheated that this disappearance is never explained. By the end of the book the author seems to have quite forgotten it.<br />The prose is drab and perfunctory. \\"Disinterested\\" is used incorrectly to mean \\"uninterested\\" (it really means \\"impartial\\") once, and \\"hopefully\\" is used incorrectly to mean \\"I hope\\" or \\"she hoped\\" four times (\\"hopefully\\" is really an ADVERB). These solecisms are inexcusable. At the very least, an editor ought to have fixed them.<br />I've read many novels having to do with time travel (the best by far is H. G. Wells's classic \\"The Time Machine). This is the first that seems utterly unable to distinguish time from space. The heroine ventures into the fourteenth century in early winter because she wants it to be near Christmas when she arrives! Nearly the whole while she is there she wonders what her compatriots in the twenty-first-century are doing! This sort of the thing is ridiculous--hilariously amateurish, really and, of course, also inexcusable.<br />The very end (inadvertantly reminiscent of \\"Hamlet\\" with bodies strewn about) has a certain dramatic heft, and the heroine's professor's misapprehensions about the era to which they send her are amusing, otherwise I should give this one star instead of two.	2001-07-10

Two examples:<br /> p.68: &quot;A minor third has a frequency ratio 6/5, so the fifth harmonic of E should have the same frequency as the sixth harmonic of C (a G).&quot; No, the fifth harmonic of E is G#, so presumably the author means &quot;the fifth harmonic of Eb&quot;. But a 6:5 minor third is really only one of many possible minor third tunings. The Pythagorean minor third, for example, is 32:27, and the 32nd harmonic of this C is the 27th harmonic of this Eb. (To ignore the Pythagorean scale is to ignore two thousand years of music history; here it is given very short shrift.) The point this chapter misses in regard to just intervals is that beating is a matter of degree. We have only to venture up one harmonic along the 6/5 Eb's series: its sixth harmonic (Bb, 36:5) clashes with the 7th harmonic of C (7:1). They are 49 cents (a quarter tone) apart and well within the &quot;critical band&quot;.<br />p.100: &quot;In his fine piece 'Stria' (1977), John Chowning used partial spacings and pseudo-octaves in the ratio of the Golden Mean (approximately .618).&quot; Sorry, the Golden Mean is not a ratio; the Golden Mean means moderation. Presumably the author intends &quot;the Golden Section&quot;. This is small error, but nevertheless inexcusable. The book ought to have been proofread and edited.<br />For an introductory text I recommend Sir James Jeans's &quot;The Science and Music&quot;. For an historical text I recommend Helmholtz's &quot;On the Sensations of Tone&quot;. For an accurate text explaining current thought I recommend Juan Roeder's &quot;The Physics and Psychophysics of Music&quot;.	2001-03-23

On its page 335 it tells us that &quot;[John Adams] is attracted to politically correct subject matter, not only in moving vocal settings like `The Word Dresser' (1989) but also in a pair of operas `Nixon in China' (1987) and `The Death of Klinghoffer' (1991), which are exemplary demonstrations of how real characters and events can be presented in imaginative and non-exploitative ways.&quot;  The term &quot;politically correct&quot; is PEJORATIVE and means the OPPOSITE of &quot;imaginative&quot;. A politically correct person is by definition a person afraid to think for himself.<br />Well for that matter I suppose, a politically correct BOOK is a book much like this one, a book that wishes to ally itself with the bold and brazen but is itself halting and timid, a book that drops the names of other writers gratuitously and quotes them excessively and out of context.	2001-01-05

I enjoyed much of it--the middle much (the beginning and end made all too apparent the silliness of the story--and I read rapidly to avoid stumbling over Wyndham's occasionally  clumsy prose and narrative lacunae). Nevertheless, I find--I'm afraid--,  &quot;Chrysalids&quot; fundamentally and irredeemably flawed. <br />1) In the  preface to a collection of what he calls his &quot;scientific  fantasies&quot; bound in a single volume, H. G. Wells explains how he  sought in them to introduce just one strange element and to make the rest  as realistic and matter-of-fact as possible. Wyndham in  &quot;Chrysalids&quot;, on the other hand, piles various unrelated or only  loosely related fancies atop one another, suffocating whatever point he  wished to make and concocting something of an aesthetic eyesore.<br />2) The  real world problems underlying the fancies of &quot;Chrysalids&quot; are  summarized most succinctly in this passage from its page 186: &quot;If they  [&quot;the Old People&quot;, that is, us] had not brought down Tribulation  [engaged in nuclear war] which all but destroyed them; then they would have  bred with the carelessness of animals until they had reduced themselves to  poverty and misery, and ultimately to starvation and barbarism [they would  have over-populated the planet--though the immediate effects of  over-population are subtler and more insidious than that].&quot;<br />How do  the characters in &quot;Chrysalids&quot; grapple with these problems? They  don't; they magically turn into butterflies and flit away to Emerald City.  Very pretty for some, no doubt, but the point of science fiction is to make  us think, not to lull us to sleep.	2000-06-30

The  problem is that it does not properly distinguish meter and time signature  (which it incorrectly calls &quot;meter signature&quot;, compounding the  problem). Meter is a grouping of beats or pulses intrinsic to the music: it  is audible. Time signature is a measuring off on paper segments of music  with the same relative duration: it is inaudible. A time signature of 3/4,  for example, tells us there will be three quarter notes worth of time per  measure and only SUGGESTS that we will HEAR groupings of three. There IS  however a difference in sound between a grouping of four (suggested by the  time signature 4/4) and a grouping of two (suggested by the time signature  2/4), and it should not be at matter of indifference how you notate your  music.<br />This book berates a certain drummer for allegedly not appreciating  that beats may not necessarily be notated as quarter notes--unfairly, in my  opinion, for notation should take into account the likely reaction of the  musicians for whom it is intended. One rarely hears the phrase &quot;swing  quarter notes&quot;; it would be perverse to give a drummer a  &quot;straight-ahead&quot; jazz part notated in 4/2 or 4/8. If you want a  good performance, not a quarrel, put it in 4/4.	2000-04-10

It violates two of  E.B. White's cardinal rules (as set forth  in &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;): 1. Do not affect a breezy manner. 2.  Do not talk down to your readers. (&quot;Lies&quot; calls itself an  exposition for grownups--or adults, as we grownups usually prefer to refer  to ourselves-- but it treats its readers like particularly backward  children.) (It also consistently violates another of E.B White's rules: it  forgets that &quot;hopefully&quot; is an adverb and uses it instead as a  synonym for &quot;I hope&quot; or &quot;let's hope&quot;.)<br />Prospective  purchasers should be cautioned that &quot;Lies&quot; is written from the  standpoint of a singer and implicitly assumes its readers are primarily  interested in singing. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, but  readers who have experience with singers and vocal teachers (and who are  not themselves singers) should know why I point this out.<br />The  &quot;lies&quot; referred to in the title are essentially simplifications,  and this book essentially replaces them with other simplifications. Certain  remarks it makes concerning rhythm are apposite, but it says nothing about  rhythm that isn't better said in Paul Creston's much earlier  &quot;Principles of Rhythm&quot;. Although &quot;Principles of Rhythm&quot;  is not cited, this section seems to me something of a watering-down,   mangling, and misunderstanding of it. <br />Tuning is much more problematic  than &quot;Lies&quot; suggests. &quot;Lies&quot; confounds Pythagorean and  just tuning. It doesn't notice that a diatonic just tuning, within a SINGLE  &quot;key&quot;, contains analomous intervals: a wolf fifth and a  Pythagorean minor third, or that there exist paradigmatic ratios for only  perfect intervals and major and minor thirds and sixths, not for augmented  and diminished intervals, not for seconds and sevenths. These other ratios  are always derived as RESULTANTS from the very tempered, Pythagorean, and  just SCALES &quot;Lies&quot; eschews. For a charming, lucid, and accurate  introduction to tuning and musical acoustics, read instead &quot;Science  and Music&quot; by Sir James Jeans.<br />To sum up: I recommend for interested  laymen &quot;The ABC of Music&quot; by Imogen Holst and &quot;Science and  Music&quot; by Sir James Jeans. I recommend for musicians and music  students &quot;Principles of Rhythm &quot; by Paul Creston. I recommend for  writers, editors, and publishers &quot;The Elements of Style&quot; by E.B.  White and William Strunk.	2000-03-30

Another isn't really necessary, especially one as clumsily written as this  other. (Cecil Forsyth's &quot;Orchestration&quot; and Walter Piston's  &quot;Orchestration&quot; are among the most engagingly written of the  books in this list. I recommend them both.)<br />It does try to distinguish  itself by including instruments most orchestration books don't (because  these instruments are not usually considered orchestral instruments).  You'll find, for example, extended essays about the accordion and the toy  piano. This fatuous attempt at all-inclusiveness comes at a price, however:  relatively little is said about such mainstays as the cello.<br />Some  inaccuracy or other appears on nearly every page. The charts at the back,  particularly the string fingering charts, are fairly worthless. I can't  imagine that anyone with some musical sophistication and a reasonably  developed ear for language would prefer this orchestration manual.	1999-12-13

It's odd to think that its first three books were originally published by themselves. They all three leave you hanging. On the other hand, there are  slight inconsistencies from book to book (for example, the witch Morgan Le  Faye is described in &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; as frumpy and in  &quot;The Candle in the Wind&quot; as beautiful). As I read, I kept hearing  in my head echoes of other writers. &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; by  turns reminded me of Hemingway's vigorous prose, his evocations of the  wild, and of Douglass Adams's British sense of humor.  In the subsequent  books I thought of E. B. White, of C. S. Lewis, and of Isaac Asimov's  &quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy-the way the camera pans from scene to scene.  The books are paced differently too; the first is leisurely; the last is  furious.<br />In any case, as I said, I think, twice before (my command of  English prose is un-masterly, alas), I very much recommend &quot;The Once  and Future King&quot;. I also recommend Ernest Hemingway's &quot;The Sun  Also Rises&quot;, Douglass Adams's &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the  Universe&quot;, E. B. White's &quot;Points of My Compass&quot;, C. S.  Lewis's &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot;, The Proclaimers's &quot;This is  the Story&quot; (their first recording) and Jeff Burns's &quot;Pentatonic  Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist&quot; (a method book).	1999-11-30
