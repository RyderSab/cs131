I honestly don't know whether this book is a total hatchet job on Michael Eisner, or if he is, in fact, a patholigical liar (among other things).  Assuming this is all true (and it seems fairly well documented), I am amazed that he is STILL running this company (the Board cannot be anything more than a rubberstamp for him). <br /> <br />As for the book, it is FAR more detailed an account of the story than I really needed to read, but I somehow kept working my way through the 530+ pages.	2005-03-21

I started reading the Stephanie Plum books right from the first story, but over the last few installments, that series has deteriorated to a pale reflection of what it once was.  The characters have become cartoons, and the plots repetitions of all that has gone before.  I keep reading the books only hoping that the author will redeem herself. <br /> <br />As for this new book, previous reviewers keep pointing out that Barney is not Stephanie.  Technically, that would be true -- her name is different and she hails from a different city, but aside from that, there is very little difference.  Okay, Barney is slightly more competent, too. <br /> <br />I don't think a single character in this book is a \\"real person\\"; not a single one speaks or acts like any normal person would.  Each one exists only so far as he/she can advance the plot (or serve as another goofy stereotype). <br /> <br />The shelves are packed with humorous crime novels set in Florida (what is it about that state that generates so many???), and many of those novels are far better than this one (try Carl Hiaasen or Lawrence Shames).  Maybe Janet Evanovich needs to slow down and spend a little more time on her flagship Plum series, instead of pounding out a \\"new\\" book as frequently as she does.	2004-11-15

I don't think there was any way for the reader to have figured it out, and that always annoys me.  On top of that, the resolution just seemed pretty implausible. <br /> <br />Oh well.

However, maybe 8 or 10 years ago I stopped reading them because the series seemed to be stuck in a rut, focusing on aspects that I was much less interested in (what passes for Lovejoy's &quot;romantic&quot; life) instead of what I wanted (more with the scams and thefts).<br />I saw this new one on the shelf and decided to give it another try.  Disappointing.  I finished it last night and am still not exactly sure who all was involved in this conspiracy and why.

I can't tell if this was a purposeful decision by the author, since the story is being told by a 15 year old boy, or if it was just plain sloppiness by the author.

I appreciate what the author was attempting to do, but do not feel the book succeeds.  It is too dry to read on its own (as a sort of William Safire-style curmudgeon rant on language), and not comprehensive enough to be a useful desk reference.<br />In addition, the first 30 or so pages are actually a biography of the author (who died a few years ago) by one of his colleagues.

It is not.  This is a character piece about 6 childhood friends who plan as kids to enter the religious life; the book follows their lives until they are in their 70s.  Yes, one of them dies, but only in the loosest of definitions is book a mystery.<br />Sometimes I wonder if I should go back and re-read one or two of Kienzle's earliest books.  I remember them as being so good, but his most recent books have not been very good at all.  He has always included long digressions, explaining the arcane points of Catholic theology or Canon Law.  However, his more recent books seem to have a mystery plot only for the sake of a framework to hang the digressions upon.<br />In this book, he also repeats himself constantly. There aren't that many characters; I think I can keep track of who is whose twin, and the significance of choosing this seminary over that seminary (since both are significant plot points).  It is almost as if it was intended to be read in installments over a long period of time.<br />All of this is not to say that I didn't find elements of this book (and other recent ones) interesting -- just that the books are guilty of false advertising of sorts.<br />The author died in December 2001.  Rest in Peace.	2002-06-11

I don't doubt that most of what is presented in the book is historically true (there are certainly lots of end notes to back things up), but the issue is what ISN'T presented in the book.  I don't think there is a single fact or opinion stated in this book that presents the Mormon Church in a positive light.  Even on what would otherwise be a &quot;neutral fact&quot;, the author's choice of words subtly (or not-so-subtly) shades the impact.<br />I suspect there are at least a COUPLE of Mormons out there who sincerely believe in their faith, and who are not secretly plotting the overthrow of the US Government while juggling their 5 or 6 polygamous wives.<br />All of that said, this is a fairly interesting history book.  You just need to keep reminding yourself as you read it that it is presenting only one side of the topic.  Every religion has a skeleton or two in its closet that it would prefer to move past.  Any religion can be made to look foolish to a non-believer; there's a reason a synonym for &quot;religion&quot; is &quot;faith.&quot;	2002-05-31

I suppose I held a glimmer of hope that the books would improve, since some of his older books were quite good.<br />The Stone Monkey is not back to the level of his early books, but it isn't awful, either.  Many of the other reviewers comment on how much they like his constant twists.  Personally, I find them overused (if you get to the point where every other page contains &quot;what you thought you knew is totally wrong&quot;, then you lose interest in trying to follow the story).  For this book, Deaver has scaled back quite a bit with his twists, although a few major plot elements still depend on the concept of one of the characters not being who they claim to be; I suppose we couldn't expect him to give that cliche up cold turkey.<br />In terms of story line, this is keeping very much in line with the previous Lincoln Rhymes novels; if you liked those, you will probably like this one.	2002-04-10

However, those who were offended or who thought it was JUST frat-boy humor (there IS frat-boy humor, but much more) missed the point and the subtlety.<br />I've read Christopher Moore's previous books, and enjoyed all of them to various degrees: some are consistently excellent, and other just &quot;have their moments.&quot;  This book has an intriguing concept and some absolutely &quot;inspired&quot; (sorry) bits of comedy.<br />Lamb starts out slow, but once you get into it, the pace picks up; that said, it is still at least 100 pages too long.<br />** POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW **<BR>I feel the ending is the weakest part of the book, which is ironic since this is the part that steals fairly directly from a very popular book which has been around for 2,000 years.  On one hand, I think even I might have been offended if Moore had gone in a totally different direction &quot;explaining&quot; the events surrounding the Crucifixion, but on the other hand, I found this a little lacking after the spins he added earlier in the story.  Also, the wrap-up of the Biff/Raziel story is completely anti-climactic.	2002-04-01

Although both involve the story of an entertainment figure spanning several decades, &quot;Carter&quot;,  while not perfect, is the more fully realized book.<br />It appears that the author of &quot;Hollywoodland Kingpin&quot;, Thorne Peters, has the idea that a &quot;serious&quot; book needs to be written in a particular way.  He seems to be trying to use \\"big words\\" and convoluted sentence structure, overflowing with metaphor and cliché. Since the resultant sentences tend to be clumsy, and contain words used in not quite the correct sense, he should instead relax and write in his natural \\"voice\\".  Also, relying on a spell-checker is not sufficient if you mis-spell using an actual word, like \\"were\\" for \\"we're\\" or \\"exceeded\\" for \\"acceded\\".<br />Those issues could be excused, to some extent, if the content of the book compensated.  The character of The Kingpin (and perhaps the author himself) has a very deep-felt philosophy about such topics as censorship and women.  The characters spend pages at a stretch explaining, re-explaining, and contemplating this philosophy.  Enough!  We get the point!<br />Previous reviewers have commented on the sexual content of the book.  I think readers are more likely to be offended by The Kingpin's philosophy toward women than they are by the sexual scenes.  Of course, one of the major themes of the book is that one should not try to keep others from enjoying something which may offend  you personally.<br />Although the author has crafted a fascinating group of characters, and placed them in an interesting story, the book falls apart in its execution.  Mr. Peters would do well to acquire a good editor for his next book.	2001-12-30

(2) The hero or villain (or both) is generally omniscient, omnipresent and omnipotent [Here, it is the villain who pulls off an amazing number of crimes in diverse places in a short period of time.  In the Lincoln Rhymes novels, Rhymes has a bottomless stockpile of arcane knowledge, eliminating any suspense, since you KNOW he will figure out everything immediately (&quot;That microscopic dirt particle on the victim could only have come from a 2-block area in lower Manahattan that for two weeks 200 years ago contained both a stockyard and a brewery&quot;) ] (3) Some character is pretending to be someone else, and the author doesn't &quot;play fair&quot; revealing this.<br />Basically, the book isn't awful, but should have been considerably better.	2001-01-15

Most of them fall into  a couple categories: 1) a prediction of how a summer's movie selection will  fare 2) a re-hash of the same season a few months later 3) predictions  about one year's Oscars 4) a re-hash of that year's Oscars (with a  side-rant about making the vote tallies public) 5) a discussion of who is  the biggest star in Hollywood<br />The essays were great when they originally  appeared, but now they lack (obviously) timeliness and uniqueness (since  they all pretty much read alike).  Goldman's near-copyrighted phrase is  &quot;No one knows anything.&quot;<br />Better luck next time.	2000-08-11

Our &quot;heroine&quot; is  constantly spinning new explanations and accusations, most of which turn  out to be mistaken.  I can't even figure out which ones she believed, and  which ones were bluffs.  Basically, her strategy seems to be accuse  everyone of everything, and eventually someone will confess.<br />Maybe if I  had read the earlier books the Mallory character would have made more sense  to me, but I don't think that should have been a requirement.	2000-01-10

It seems like the series has moved farther and farther from a firm concrete  reality.  Burke himself seems to be less personally resourceful, and now  has to rely on outsiders instead of himself (or even his &quot;family  members&quot;).  As much as I enjoy the series, I have a hard time  recalling plot points from books 8 or 9 years earlier, yet these points are  fairly significant to the plot of this one.	1999-06-10
US	52231160	R20OBIK2QQKWPA	1580630073	735321431	Pufnstuf & Other Stuff: The Weird and Wonderful World of Sid & Marty Krofft	Books	2	15	17	N	N	not enough behind-the-scenes information	If you want a good behind-the-scenes look at the making of the Krofft shows, this isn't the book - it is more of a warm-and-fuzzy remembrance.  Perhaps this was a little too &quot;authorized&quot;.  Too many  dubious-sounding and self-serving &quot;facts&quot; are given by the  Brothers Krofft.  The author seems to have done little research on his own,  and depends completely on interviews with a few people.  Far too many times  in the book, someone would say &quot;I don't know whatever happened to  so-and-so&quot; - and the book just leaves it that way instead of doing a  little legwork and looking.  How about a few more pictures?  If the author  really had access to the Krofft archives, he should have included a few  more photos.	1999-04-26
