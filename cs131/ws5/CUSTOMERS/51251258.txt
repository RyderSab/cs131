Not a flat out terrible book, but definitely a notch below averages. The author whips out more cliches than Mickey Spillane. He even uses the phrase \\"milky white thighs\\" at one point. The characters are uninteresting, and represent nothing new or exceptional in fantasy. The plot's so-so, but then so are a lot of plots. I dropped it about halfway through because I just didn't care a bit about what happened (of course maybe it got better as it went along). About the most exceptional thing I can say about it is that it had more sex and violence than usual, but, trust me, that's not a reason to read it.	2005-06-07

The book teams with interesting characters, and features several plot lines (a performing horse, an amorous actor, a murdered actor, and a dying queen) in the 233 pages of this book. Fortunately the plots are all resolved to satisfaction. There's not a terribly great mystery, but that doesn't seem the point with this series. The melodramatic life of Westfield's Men, the acting troupe, is the real story here. However, one doesn't need to read the novels in order, or start at the beginning or anything. They are fun to read, and one can inadvertently learn a bit about Elizabethan England.	2005-05-27

It's a fairly complete overview of Greek mythology, with simple pictures that we love. I had fun reading this to my son (he's six) and he loved listening to it. I fully expect that as he grows into a more capable reader, this is a book he'll be coming back to again and again...just as I did when I was his age. For an intro to Greek mythology, you can't top this book.	2005-05-19

Wallis starts with the assumption that the Religious Right (or the Christian Coalition, take your pick) doesn't really represent the opinions of most Christians, nor does it really represent the teachings of the guy that the whole shebang is named after, Jesus. He also maintains the Left, with its emphasis on certain issues, doesn't really offer a whole lot for Christians of moral conviction. I can't really argue with his analysis. He goes on to deal with what America, and the world, really needs: compassion, community, and civility. He then details how these are currently lacking, how these concepts tie in to Christianity, and how these concepts can help improve things in general. <br /> <br />My two nit-picking complaints are that, one, he doesn't do much to detail how to achieve the desired states of compassion, community and civility, and, two, he doesn't do much to explain that this message is for more than just Christians. His message is one of inclusivity, and throughout the book, he does mention people of other faiths, but this book seems mostly written for Christians. I think it's important to realize that there are a number of people of other faiths, and a number of people of no particular faith, who would agree with what he says we need. <br /> <br />Overall a pretty good book, encouraging and inspiring. Makes me want to go out and do good works.	2005-04-15

Until I read this book, my only experience with Matt Helm was the goofy series of Dean Martin movies from the sixties. I read this book on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised. In this book, Matt has to protect a (female) scientist from a bad guy who's supposed to assassinate her at some vague point in the future. Unlike the movies, the tone is completely serious, and Hamilton has written a very suspenseful, lean book that was fun to read. It reminded me a good bit of John D. MacDonald's &quot;Travis McGee&quot; books. I definitely plan on picking up more Donald Hamilton.	2002-12-02

On the upside: the pacing of this book is excellent. There is enough character development for the reader to feel comfortable with the main characters, yet to me, it didn't detract from the drama of the search for the serial killer. I'm kind of lukewarm on the graphic nastiness of novels (it doesn't bother me, but I don't usually feel it's necessary) and this is a fairly nasty and unpleasantly direct novel, but for the most part, it seems to contribute to the feeling of horror that the author is trying to evoke. Overall, the writing is pretty good. On the downside: Some of the characters were pretty formulaic, the plot was pretty routine, and the resolution was too predictable. However, I read the book very quickly (I'm an awfully slow reader), which indicates to me that I had difficulty putting it down. In summation, I don't think this book has anything new to offer, but it is a competent and frequently, better-than-average suspense novel.	2002-09-09
US	51251258	R1SLWX9WQO3WJA	0441007562	588578975	The Rainy Season	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Surprisingly somber and serious	I really like James Blaylock, and this is a very solid book by him, but it was much more serious and less whimsical than other of his books. Once again, he's crafted unique individuals for characters, and each one is utterly believable. In this book, his characters are struggling to find the tangible, preserved memory of a little girl who was drowned in a spring in California many years before. There are moments in this book of real sadness and loss, and I found it a very affecting read. Still, I prefer my Blaylock a bit more light-hearted, thus 4 instead of 5 stars.	2002-08-14

I liked the first couple of Kay Scarpetta books, but I hadn't read any for a while because they seemed to go down in quality. I finally picked this one up and it's probably the last I'll ever read. I still think that Cornwell has talent, but she apparently didn't feel up to coming up with anything new or worthwhile. This book is primarily about Kay and her private life; only rarely is the &quot;mystery&quot; (a hunt for a particularly vicious serial killer) brought up. I didn't like many of her characters much to begin with, but they've turned into charicatures of themselves now. Marino has become a loathsome bigotted low-class piece of dirt, and Lucy is a crazed lesbian who wants to destroy the world. If you care what happens to Lucy, Marino, Rose, and especially Scarpetta, you probably should read this. To me, it was far too melodramatic and whiny; Scarpetta is to wrapped up in her life to be of any interest, and the rest of the characters were repellent or boring.	2002-08-14

He's got a really unique voice, and his stories, usually very short and very readable, are certainly a example of sci-fi at its finest. Some really great stories in this collection. However, I guess it's kind of silly to call this a sci-fi collection. There's horror, fantasy, sci-fi, and a lot of plain old good short story in this collection. If you like to read short stories, I highly recommend any of his collections, because they seem consistently good to me.	2002-05-18
US	51251258	R1YCPQ0DQ7PNXG	0345314255	643750532	The Sword of Shannara	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Some good, some bad	This is the first time I've read this, unlike apparently a lot of other reviewers who seem to have revisited this one. I have to say, my initial reaction wasn't very favorable. The first part of this book is so like Lord of the Rings, as has been stated before, that I almost put it down. However, as far as the story goes, it improves as the book progresses. Nonetheless, it is a fairly standard plot (i.e. our hero Shea is given a quest to find a powerful sword. He journeys across the lands, encountering dreadful beasts and perils of all sorts.) The good thing is, when there is action, it's pretty good stuff. The bad thing about this book, aside from the lack of originality, is how very bad some of the writing is. With a good editor, this book could be 200-300 pages shorter, and probably be improved by it. Some examples: The industrious author's frustating overuse of modifying, redundant, and unnecessary adjectives and adverbs. This obnoxious tendency can quickly become irritating, as the patient review reader will readily determine by closely reading this silly paragraph. Seriously, you could remove every other adjective and adverb in this book, just at random, and it would be a much better book. The author uses the phrase &quot;burning fire.&quot; Twice. In the same paragraph. What other kind of fire is there? I thought all fires were burning. He also says something like &quot;It left an indelible mark, which couldn't be removed.&quot; I thought that's what &quot;indelible&quot; meant. And every stinkin' time he refers to a character, he has to put an adjective in front of the character. Menion is always &quot;the lean Highlander&quot; and Shea is always &quot;the little Valeman.&quot; Since he went to the trouble to describe these characters in the beginning of the book, by page 700, I got a little tired of rereading descriptions of them. Oh, one last thing about descriptions, he always describes what the sunlight, the land and the trees look like. Always. Do we really always need to know that the sunlight passed through the soft green leaves, dappling the rock-strewn turf? That gets old. I think that all these descriptions, in addition to being boring, tend to confuse the reader, or at least me. It seemed important to the author to point out that the sun was casting great looming shadows to the west, and then the characters would be getting up in the morning, eating a small tasteless breakfast, not heated by fire, for they were afraid that a fire would signal their presence to enemies. Hey! I thought it was dusk. I just think it's distracting to always know where the sun is, what the shadows look like, how breakfast was, what folks are wearing, how the sky looks to the north, how the trees appear as they cling to the slopes of distant hills, etc. Just tell us the stinkin' story, fer cryin' out loud. Okay, I've complained a lot, maybe even more than it deserves. A quick conclusion: It starts off pretty bad, but gets considerably better (probably finishes as a three-star book). Especially irritating to those (like me) who have read a lot of fantasy. Many of the things that seem hackneyed to us would probably not bother those that don't read a lot of fantasy. And I can hardly wait to read the next one!	2002-02-12

It reads like a pulp action story, at times. And our hero Jack is a little to good to be true. Mighty thews and all. Brooding countenance and flashing eyes. However that doesn't make this a bad book. It makes it a pretty entertaining and action-packed book, and while Jack may be a little unbelievable, the action and story aren't unbelievable. Essentially, Jack, the 18 year old son of a gun smith, is swept off on a whirlwind adventure that takes him from the fledgling USA to Cuba to the South Pacific. In it, he encounters self-righteous Yankees, evil Cuban noblemen, bloodthirsty Pacific Islanders (savages, don't you know), bloodthirstier Dutch slavers, and British press gangs. Okay, there are a lot of cliches (and I mean a lot), but there is a lot of fun in here too. And despite the notorious and nigh-legendary phrase &quot;the pintles were sprung from the gudgeon,&quot; there's not an overwhelming amount of sea-stuff in here. Try reading Patrick O'Brian and you'll see what I mean. This book is comparable to Wilbur Smith's &quot;Birds of Prey.&quot; Kinda like an old Errol Flynn movie. I enjoyed this book a good bit, and would be interested in reading more from these authors.	2002-01-17

All this perambulation has a nefarious connection with a pioneer town founded by witches. If it sounds pretty neato, a good deal of the novel is pretty neato. There's some really bizarre stuff going on, and that is the good side of this novel. The bad side is the logic (or lack thereof) of a lot of this novel. I don't care how bizarre things get (frequently, the more bizarre the better, see Tim Powers and James Blaylock) but there should be an internal logic, there should be reasons for what's happening, and those reasons should make some kind of sense. Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot of that in this book. Weird stuff happens and then its forgotten, never to be explained or even mentioned again. In fact, towards the end of the book, one of the characters says something like &quot;Not everything can be explained,&quot; which I think is the author's way of saying &quot;Sorry, not gonna tell why that guy suddenly turned into a penguin.&quot; (Not that that happens, I don't want to confuse anyone.) There are a lot of good things about this novel (I actually liked and identified with most of the characters) but ultimately I was disappointed.	2001-11-28

On the way, she and her soldiers (all female) have a series of pretty entertaining adventures. Rali is a pretty solid character, and the action is pretty much nonstop. Nothing brilliant about this book, but I would say it's probably above average fantasy stuff, which kept me reading till the end. It starts off with a war and keeps going. Lots of demons, gore soaked swords, nubile maidens, and pyrotechnic wizardry. As a warning I might point out, it has a good deal of same-sex relationships going on, which some readers might find distracting (and some might find titillating). All in all, it ain't highbrow lit-ra-ture, but it's fun to read.	2001-11-19

Sharpe must drag a company of British soldiers through French-controlled Spain, and in the process helps a Spanish nobleman achieve a miracle. There are two things that I really enjoy about this series:<br />1. Great historical detail and a superabundance of historical information. I've looked for other books about this time in European history, and there are surprisingly few. It was a fascinating time, when modern techniques were evolving, but when cavalry was still the most potent weapon.<br />2. Action, action, action. These books make me feel as though I've been slogging through the bitter winters and unordered retreats, and then forced into battle, where the smells of blood and powder intermingle. Kinda exhausting at times.<br />My only complaint with the series as a whole is that it sometimes leans towards melodrama, but, hey, sometimes that makes the books more interesting. People who enjoy the Hornblower series or Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey and Maturin series should enjoy these if they crave a little land action.	2001-11-13

Redmond and Bierce try to track down a Ripper-style killer of prostitutes and unravel a mystery that has ties to the California Gold Rush and the Railroad boom in California. All in all, the history is good (and you'll probably learn a good bit if you know nothing about mining or railroads) and the mysteries provide a nice little puzzle. Despite the title, Bierce is not the main character, Redmond is, and he's quite an interesting, well-developed and sympathetic one. Bierce is kind of a secondary character, although the book is peppered with his acerbic, sarcastic thinking (one of the things I enjoyed most of all, actually). This book is less Holmes-and-Watson than Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin, which is a more satisfying arrangement, I think. I enjoyed it and I think most people who like historical mysteries will enjoy it also.	2001-10-31

If you've never read a Perry Mason novel, here's what they have going for them: Terrific pace (a couple of pages in and you're embroiled in a mystery), good dialogue, complicated plot, a decent amount of suspense (especially in the court room scenes) and best of all, a very quick read. A lot like the TV show. All the Perry Mason novels I've read (about 10) are pretty much the same, which is really the one main drawback. Six months from now, I doubt I'll remember much about this book. Still, a lot of fun. Again, a lot like the TV show.	2001-08-27

Hawkmoon's quest for peace in his world is typical Moorcock fantasy, with bold heroes, evil opponents, hideous fates, weird monsters, and most of all, lots of action. In his preface, Moorcock warns us not to look to deeply for meaning in Hawkmoon, but that's like saying &quot;Don't think of an elephant.&quot; There are certainly some themes here that Moorcock returns to in later books, but they are treated perhaps a tad more superficially here than in later years (not really a fault or anything, I just thought I'd mention it). As in Elric and Corum (my personal favorite), the author uses a fable-like semi-mythological style that makes the story move and focuses attention where it needs to be focused. For example, when Hawkmoon travels hundreds of miles to a city in the Middle East, the author devotes about four pages to the journey. Some writers (think Robert Jordan) would make the journey half a book long. This simplicity of style is one of my favorite things about Michael Moorcock. The only real weakness to this novel, as has been mentioned by other reviewers, is Hawkmoon himself. He's not really much of a character. Mostly he is either fighting or saying how he wishes he could return to his wife. He also seems kinda dim-witted at times. Usually one of the other characters is the one who comes up with a solution to a problem, or notices that the bad guys are coming or that Hawkmoon's pants are on fire. Not a big weakness, but in comparison to more interesting characters like Corum or Elric, a noticeable weakness. Still, if you like Elric or Corum, or just sword and sorcery stuff in general, this is highly recommended.	2001-02-09

Action galore, brave deeds and derring-do abound. The author obviously researched his subject in great detail, and has created a convincing and entertaining story that will keep the reader glued to the book. He writes like a modern-day Edgar Rice Burroughs (which is a compliment). I should point out that this is not really a naval adventure ala Patrick O'Brian or C.S. Forrester. Only about a third of the book takes place at sea. This is more like a really long old-fashioned adventure movie, with a good splash of graphic violence and a bit of lurid sex thrown in.	2001-01-23

It seems like the author has just recycled scenes from the first three books. There's very little plot, essentially:<br />Parliament member: There's something evil, hideous and terrible on (fill in planet name here).<br />Owen: OK. Hazel and I will go kill it.<br />Hazel: Yeah, I can't wait to smash something and kill something else and stab and wound and destroy.<br />Then they go. Not much of a plot.<br />Really sloppy, bad writing that could have been trimmed down from 500+ pages to about 200 pages. The characters frequently repeat conversations that they had 20 pages previously.<br />I guess you can tell I'm a little disappointed with this book. I'm giving it two stars instead of one because the action, when it eventually happens, is still pretty entertaining, and the author does have some pretty cool ideas; they're just not carried out very well in this book. My opinion, this book isn't worth reading. If you like the Deathstalker series, go back and reread 1--3.	2001-01-23

The first few chapters of this book could have been about me. The author goes from there and imagines a world with people who are &quot;ignored,&quot; for all intents and purposes, invisible to the rest of the world. It's a nice premise for a story, but seems like maybe not enough for a novel. Consequently the story drags at times, and then gets kinda bizarre at the end. For most horror fans, there's probably not enough traditional horror elements in it, but for those who are interested in reading something a little different, it's fairly entertaining and worthwhile.	2000-12-18

This book contains three stories published in the in the 50s, and deals  with adventures of Nicholas Van Rijn and the Polesotechnic League.  Interesting stuff, for a quick read. Anderson tries to create realistic  worlds based on real facts. Each story deals with the League (a loosely  federated group of merchants) and its encounters with a new civilization.  Each story is a little puzzle in its own way, of how the League will deal  successfully with the new civilizations it encounters. Kinda sociological  Sherlock Holmes stuff. Very well thought out, and logical, with some of the  fun of golden age sci-fi thrown in.	2000-09-17

Worth reading if you don't mind not being surprised or astounded. I had heard a lot of good things about this book, and was perhaps expecting a little more  (this ain't no Dave Robicheaux) but I didn't feel like I wasted my time  reading it. The characters to me were kinda flat, except for Eddie, the guy  who goes undercover as a hunchback, but the scenery and settings were well  done. A food analogy? Well, how about this: Like ordering steak, and being  served a good hamburger. It'll satisfy your hunger, but it's not what you  really wanted.	2000-06-15

Some of the characters are well-drawn (specifically Lynley and Havers) and others are almost pathetically two-dimensional (the brash annoying American  couple, the tortured artist, the anguished priest, etc.) The plot is not  much, but was enough to keep my interest. One annoying thing (and this  pervades the entire series) is the misapprehension that rich, beautiful,  (titled, in England) people are more interesting and really, better, than  us working class slobs. George isn't the only one who makes this mistake;  about half of all thriller writers do this, and most Hollywood producers do  too. I guess if you like to read books about rich, beautiful, titled  people, then this wouldn't bother you, but I find it tiresome. Overall, a  so-so book, fine to read on an airplane or at the beach, but not a  substitute for P.D. James or Ruth Rendell.	2000-05-04

James Bond has been done before and been done better. And the bad guys are  Russians and Arabs. Yawn. Predictable from the word &quot;Go&quot;. Of  minor interest is the hero's (and presumably the author's) views on  ecology. Apparently, attempts to reduce pollution and ecological hazards  are direct subversions of the process of evolution. I told a friend of mine  this once as a joke; I was startled to see it argued in all seriousness in  print. Final point: This is a pale imitation of Clive Cussler, and I'm not  saying that Clive Cussler's a genius or anything, but he can at least tell  an entertaining story.	2000-04-19

Douglas states early on in the book that this book is not a how-to on profiling. Such a task would be far too complicated to ever put into a single book. What Douglas does give us, with enough detail to make things  interesting, is a number of examples of how profiles are used, and how  potent a weapon profiles can be against criminals. There is an ego issue;  Mr. Douglas seems very proud of his achievements, but the real pride seems  to be for all profilers, and how good they actually are. At times this  attitude can be a little overbearing, but it's understandable. Those  expecting a lot of esoteric and hitherto unrevealed knowledge about  specific cases are sure to be disappointed, but all in all, this book is a  very worthwhile overview of the discipline of profiling.	2000-04-17

The plot to this book isn't really a whole lot...more like a historical romance than a sci-fi book, but the characters are some of the most finely wrought that I've ever encountered  in sci-fi. I may not like most of them, but I understood them all, and  thought of them as real people (a very difficult trick). Bujold is  extremely accomplished at this, and she brings humanity to what is often a  cold, impersonal genre.	2000-04-02

This book doesn't have that, as a rule. I think the lead characters are interesting, different, and even &quot;compelling&quot;, the plot kept me guessing, and the dialogue, while not exactly snappy or crackling, was realistic, i.e. the characters said what real people would say in these situations. I hate to resort to hackneyed phrases, but I found this book to be unputdownable and refreshing.  END	2000-03-15

Hamilton details his worlds and events with admirable precision. I enjoyed the complexity, but I can understand how some readers might want to  stay away from the hundreds of characters and hundreds of situations.  However, once the stage is set, the series really takes off. Read it, and  your reward is the pleasure of reading the rest of the books.	2000-02-10

I bored all of my friends and my wife to tears telling them about this book that I was reading that was written in the 1920's (I'm guessing it was written in the 20's), and how relevant it was  to our society today. It has pompous businessmen, evangelical conmen,  hypocrital churchmen, and many more contemporary characters. One note to  potential readers: This is a portrait of a person; it's not a thriller, or  a romance or a mystery. As such, it has very little plot, so beware. But  for readers who wish to try this book, and read it as a study of a class of  people, most will find it very rewarding.	1999-09-09

Simultaneously disturbing and fun. I like the fact that there really is no good side and bad side, no light and dark. Too many fantasies get caught up in the typical rendering  of an underdog force of good battling a dread force of evil, and these  novels ignore that, acknowledging that most &quot;good&quot; people have  some bad in them, and vice versa. The main characters are interesting  enough, and the plot is terrific, moving at nice pace. This book proves  that a good fantasy novel does not have to be 700--800 pages long.	1999-08-20
