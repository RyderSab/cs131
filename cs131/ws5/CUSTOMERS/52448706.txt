I nearly didn't buy this book because the reviews on this site were so lukewarm, but as a fan of Kleypas's I couldn't pass it up. I actually read this title in little over a day. It held my interest  and didn't strike me as having been written by someone who was on automatic pilot.  I don't think it is Lisa's best. (The best was \\"Suddenly You,\\" in my humble opinion.) But I very much liked the hero and the heroine. The heroine did not strike me as money-grubbing, just someone who knew what she wanted and set her sights to get it. She wasn't dishonest and the hero knew from the get-go that money and living comfortably was not insignificant to her. In fact he seemed to appreciate this quality in her and be amused by it.  I don't  know how this makes her different from any of the other people in her society. And she became very open-minded about  people of the working class of which the hero was once apart; so, if she was at one point snobby, she got over it.   <br />    As for steaminess, I thought the book was actually a little less steamy than some of Kleypas's other books, but  still hot.  This is not great Kleypas, but it is good Kleypas. And I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.	2004-12-01

I think this is one of the books that not only made me a Delinsky fan, but a romance book fan as well. It is just really well done. And it holds up 15 years after it was first published!Delinsky is more a &quot;women's fiction&quot; writer than a &quot;romance&quot; writer these days -- which is a big loss to the romance genre. My only comfort is that every few years I can pick up one of her best romance titles -- in this case 'Heart of the Night&quot; -- and have a few hours of blissful reading enjoyment once again with familiar but still enjoyable characters. And may I also add that if you liked this book, then you owe it to yourself to pick up Delinsky's &quot;Through My Eyes.&quot;  It's another title that stands the test of time.	2003-03-12

I found this book to be just a wonderful collection of essays about the connections between home and spirit and recommend it highly who is currently in the process of trying to merge or re-merge the two. It especially speaks to women who are starting over in their lives after a divorce but could be just as useful to all women attempting to create some kind of spiritual retreat in which to nurture their bodies and souls. After reading this book, I decided to subscribe to Ms. Browning's House and Garden magazine so I would have the opportunity to enjoy a new essay of hers on the topic of home and life once a month. Her style of writing very much reminds me of Anna Quindlen's. For anyone else who enjoyed Dominique's book, you might also want to read &quot;When A Woman Takes an Ax to A Wall: Where Is She Really Trying To Go?&quot; by Allegra Bennett.	2002-09-08

I have read virtually each book in the series at least twice. So, I look forward to each new installment as anxiously as the next fan. But I've gotta say that this book didn't quite do it for me. I read with a feeling of deja vu. Even the scenes with Roarke and Eve didn't totally engage me. Nora Roberts puts out a huge volume of work each year. Maybe too much -- spreading  her creative energy too thin. Still, I am looking forward to the next book. In the meantime I will just re-read another In Death favorite.	2002-09-02

After reading this book each day for three years running, I took a break this year. But in 2002 I plan to pick it up again because I think it serves as a wonderful daily reminder for one to nourish one's spirit and to express gratitude for life's blessings.It's a timeless book that will never go out of date. Still, I hope to see Simple Abundance II, someday.<br />    Might I add that for fans of Simple Abundance -- or for that matter, anyone who is in search of self and her -- or his -- place in the world, the book &quot;Gift From the Sea,&quot; by Anne Morrow Lindbergh, is a perfect companion book to Sara Ban Breathnach's work. It is a book that was written in 1955, yet still manages to fully articulate the inner struggles so many people today -- and most particularly women today -- are trying to come to grips with. At the same time it illustrates that as much as we would like to believe that much of what occurs in our lives is a new occurence, the fact is that there truly is nothing new under the sun, that these struggles just persist from generation to generation.<br />How can one not think she speaks directly to women of both the 20th and 21st (and probably the 22nd) centuries when she writes:<br />&quot;With a new awareness, both painful and humorous, I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women. I am convinced it has nothing inherently to do, as I once supposed, with chastity or children. It has to do primarily with distractions. The bearing, rearing, feeding and educating of children; the running of a house with its thousand details; human relationships with their myriad pulls -- woman's normal occupations in counter to creative life, or contemplative life, or saintly life. The problem is not merely one of Woman and Career, Woman and the Home, Woman and Independence. It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balance, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how toremain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery and tend to crack the hub of the wheel&quot;<BR>     <BR>   I can barely in a few quotes pay this book the respect it deserves.It's like Simple Abundance times three.Suffice it to say that I highly recommend this book.In fact, I suspect it is going to be my goal in 2002 to put it in the hands of many friends, family members and acquaintances!	2001-12-27

For anyone -- but most particularly any woman -- in search of self and her place in the world this book, written in 1955, is a must read. It so fully articulates the inner struggles so many women today try to come to grips with-- while at the same time it illustrates that as much as we would like to believe that much of what occurs in our lives is a new occurence, the fact is that there truly is nothing new under the sun, that these struggles just persist from generation to generation.<BR> This diary is so timely throughout that it is at times almost spooky. Hear Lindbergh, for example, conjure up images of the impact of today's Martha Stewart at a time when Martha Stewart was just 14 years old and still a very long way from Lindbergh's consciousness or that of the general public:<br />&quot;Here I live in a bare sea-shell cottage. No heat, no telephone, sweeping and clearning here. I am no longer aware of the dust no plumbing to speak of, no hot water, a two-burner oil stove, no gadgets to go wrong. No rugs. There were some, but I rolled them up the first day; it is easier to sweep the sand off a bare floor. But I find I don't bustle about with unnecessary sweeping and cleaning here. I have shed my Puritan conscience about absolute tidiness and cleanliness. Is it possible that, too, is a material burden? No curtains. I do not need them for privacy; the pines around my house are enough protection. I want the windows open all the time and I don't want to worry about rain. I begin to shed my Martha-like anxiety about many things. Washable slipcovers, faded and old -- I hardly see them; I don't worry about the impression they make on other people. I am shedding pride. As little furniture as possible; I shall not need much. I shall ask into my shell only those friends with whom I can be completely honest.&quot;<br />And listen to her speak directly to women of both the 20th and 21st (and probably the 22nd) centuries when she writes:<br />&quot;With a new awareness, bothpainful and humorous, I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women.

It's the &quot;In Death&quot; series by J.D. Robb. It will take you into the futuristic/murder mystery/romance genre, but don't be put off by the futuristic aspect of the books. Romance dominates. The chemistry between the hero and heroine  -- very much like that of Jack and Amanda in the five-star Suddenly You-- is strong enough to have accounted for something like eight or nine books so far with the couple (Eve and Roarke) as the focus. One piece advice: Start at the beginning of the series with &quot;Naked in Death,&quot; and read the books in order. I promise you, you won't be able to put them down.	2001-06-19

But a newsletter I received spoke so well of he new book &quot;Suddenly You&quot;  that I broke down and bought it, I am very happy to say.  What I enjoyed most about this extremely well-written book besides the highly sensual love story was the fact that the heroine and hero were total grown-ups. Smart, witty, expressive, respectful of each other,tuned into each other. I read the book in about a day. My only regret was that the book ended. Would have been okay with me had it gone on for another hundred pages. The lead characters were that likeable.	2001-06-16

To express how truly wonderful and helpful and enlightening and potentially life-changing this book is. In a way it's almost unfortunate that the book has the title &quot;Spiritual Divorce: Divorce as A Catalyst for an Extraordinary Life,&quot; because  a lot of people are going to pass right by it on the book shelf because they are going to feel it doesn't apply to them. In fact IT APPLIES TO VIRTUALLY ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE THE BEST THEY CAN BE AND SHARE THAT BEST WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING BE IT IN MARRIAGE, FRIENDSHIPS OR WORK RELATIONSHIPS. In other words, this is  NOT just a book for couples contemplating separation or even a book just for couples. Anyone who wants to grow as a human being, get the most from what life and people have to teach them and get rid of the baggage or negative thinking that might prevent -- or is preventing --them from having a healthy, long-lasting loving, productive relationship with another person should read this book.Trust me it is THAT good.	2001-05-26

What amazes me more and more as I read these types of books as that virtually every author says that, bottom line, one has to take the focus off what the spouse is or isn't doing and focus inward, looking at what one's self is or is not doing and why. Phil tries to ingrain this point on readers over and over both on Oprah and in his book. He does, indeed, tell it like it is. His style might not always be kind and gentle, but I think that's a strength where he is concern. In any case, I highly recommend not only this book but Debbie Ford's &quot;Spiritual Divorce&quot; which I think is the perfect companion book to &quot;Relationship Rescue.&quot; And before you dismiss it because you are not thinking of divorce or separating from your particular, I very much suggest that you give this book a look-see. The title is a misnomer since it is so much more than a book for people divorcing. If you are trying to figure out how to improve your marriage, save your marriage, better a relationship with a a friend or a co-worker, prepare yourself for a relationship with a significant other or just improve your relationship with yourself, this is so the book for you.Like Phil, Ford emphasizes the need to look within at one's own self.Do the work on yourself and the rest will to a large extent fall into place. Her style is, like Phil's straighforward, but in a different, maybe more &quot;spiritual&quot; way.  I guess it's no accident that both Phil and Debbie Ford have appeared on Oprah. Two separate styles but one mind.If you have both these titles on your nightstand, and you really put them into action, I can't see how they cannot help you on your life's journey. They are definitely helping me.	2001-05-26

Yes, those readers who came to like  Delinsky when she started writing her hardcover contemporary novels for  women may be disappointed because she's writing different types of stories  today.

I just picked this title up again to re-read and I've got to say, it is still one of my top two favorites in the In Death series by J.D. Robb. (The other is the very first book in the collection: Naked in Death).  &quot;Rapture&quot; introduces us to the newly-wed Roarke and Eve and it  underscores not only their physical passion for each other, but their  passion for each others minds and spirits.

But I think  NoraRoberts/J.D. Robb is simply back in top form with &quot;Witness&quot;  bringing  the kind of  depth to her characterizations and storytelling that  I had begun to miss.    All of the regular cast of characters is back,  stronger than ever. Familiar, but with a few surprises. As for Eve and  Roarke, what can I say? I have never been so hooked into a fictional couple  as I am these two. They are just so vivid and sexy and smart. I just love  them.    This is a really, really good, relaxing read.

I've found the recent negative comments about this book quite interesting. SIMPLE ABUNDANCE is a New Age-type of book. It doesn't pretend to be otherwise. And it speaks to the belief, held by more than a few, that there  is within each of us a HIGHER POWER that we can draw upon in our daily  efforts to live our lives to the fullest. If you are among those who don't  believe that we each draw from some kind of Higher Power -- God, Buddah, or  whoever you might call Him (or Her)-- and that some part of that Higher  Power is within each of us, then this book is probably NOT for you.    Breathnach's references -- and there are numerous references from many,  many different sources, including in a few instances, the Bible-- are meant  to offer people some guidance on how they can live their lives in spiritual  abundance and happiness. It is a book, I believe, that virtually anyone --  regardless of religious beliefs or background -- can come away from reading  with something of value to add to their lives. Take whatever part works for  you and forget the rest.	2000-01-10
