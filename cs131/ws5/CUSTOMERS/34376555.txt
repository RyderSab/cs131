Moreover, the fancy pictures, explanations, examples, essays ease the learning experienfce that you may entail with this book. <BR>The exercise section is extensive 80 question for each section. The same type of exercises repeat often, yet they really help if someone wants to practice more and more for a test.<BR>For someone who has taken stoichometry, inorganic naming, gas laws, bonding and basic concepts of inorganic chemistry (like me) in High School, then teh first sections might be useless.

US	34376555	R8D3O1JP214UC	003026961X	550859677	Physics for Scientists and Engineers, Chapters 1-39 (with Student Tools CD-ROM)	Books	5	1	4	N	N	The better of the famous Trio of Physics for	Scientists and Engineers textbooks....<br />This textbook shows the thoery and derivations like Fishbane's series of textbooks and also throws a lot of examples like Gioncolli's series of textbooks.<br />Unfortunately, you are going to have to pay a lot more... but I think it's worth it. <br />I also suggest you buy WILSON and BUFFA's COLLEGE PHYSICS textbooks to supplement your study.	2002-12-11
US	34376555	R1WFJZX2MGNN91	0132311763	638677984	Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Extended Version, 2nd Edition	Books	5	3	15	N	N	Excelllent for UNIVERSITY CALBRE students...	Unfortunately, more than half the intro students at university are not up to the calibre required by university.  These are the type of students who wouldn't like a CALCULUS RALTED introductory to physics textbook (or course for that matter).  If you are well versed in physics and calculus from highschool, you should find this book to be very good.  It gives u proofs for everything.  If you're into plugging formulas into numbers and just solving problems using simple algebra, I suggest you take a look at the WILSON BUFFA textbooks on COLLEGE PHYSICS.  If you up to the task of tackling university, this book is very good.	2002-12-11
US	34376555	R2SKZVWEWOOD78	0471134473	972903154	Basic Physics: A Self-Teaching Guide	Books	5	50	58	N	N	Simply amazing....	I do not recommend this as a textbook in any sort of way.  You won't learn much detail from this book. BUTTTTT I strongly suggest u take a week or two to read through it (a chapter at a time).... before u start ur more intense study using your normal textbook.  This book will give u the basic THEORY behind physics.  This will come in handy once u start using weird formulas and whatnot during your course.  So read it first.  It's an easy read, so don't fear that it might take too long.	2002-12-11
