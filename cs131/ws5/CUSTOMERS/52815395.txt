An offhand remark from Moon about Night Eater's plump figure causes him to go on a diet and refuse to take one more bite of the night. Darkness ensues along with all its consequences. <br /> <br />This is a beautiful, whimsical tale that is greatly enriched by Ana Juan's divine illustrations.

This one takes place exactly one century ago, in 1904 Indiana, \\"when automobiles began to burn up the rural byways. The year airships like boxkites began to darken the skies, though they hadn't found our patch of sky yet.\\" <br /> <br />Russell Culver's sentiments run from ecstasy to despair when he learns that dreadful Miss Myrt, the schoolteacher, has succumbed to a sudden heart attack just before the beginning of the school year. No sooner is Miss Myrt laid to rest in the Balm of Gilead Cemetary than it becomes clear that her successor is going to be Russell's seventeen-year-old sister, Tansy, and all hope for closing the \\"Jailhouse of School\\" is dashed. <br /> <br />Miss Tansy proves to be a formidible and adept new schoolmarm, and Russell's dreams of escaping to the wheatfields of the Dakotas are the only thing that keep him sane. She is determined to prove herself worthy of a preliminary teaching credential and tolerates none of the hijinks that her brother and his pals might attempt to put in her way. <br /> <br />There is no shortage of suitors for the pert young teacher in these rural parts. Most promising is Eugene Hammond, a city slicker from Terra Haute who makes his entrance into town crashing his eight-cylinder \\"Bullet No. 2\\" racing car with the Culver family's buggy, sending the spinster Aunt Maud into a ditch. Mr. Hammond subsequently showers lavish gifts for the classroom upon Miss Tansy, all of which are inscribed, \\"Compliments of The Overland Automobile Company; Terra Haute--Indianapolis.\\" <br /> <br />In the backdrop of this hilarious saga is the understated wisdom of O.C. Culver, Russell's Dad, a widower, who always seems to have a greater understanding of what is going on than his fifteen-year-old son had ever suspected. His warmth and depth of character is reminiscent of Atticus Finch in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" <br /> <br />This is a warm and refreshing read that will make you laugh out loud. Richard Peck is such a thorough researcher of the time period about which he writes that you can be assured that all the details, sentiments and nuances are authentic.	2004-10-17

When a family crisis causes her carefree world to crumbles, this delightfully articulate fourth grader shuts down emotionally and struggles to contend with feelings of betrayal and loss.  <br /> <br />Katherine Hannigan has created an unforgettable character who experiences a full range of human emotions and does an outstanding job of expressing the motivation behind the character's thoughts and actions. Young readers may experience some self-discovery through Ida B.'s wrestle with the conflicts she faces (and a few that she creates herself).	2004-09-04

I loved this book and expected it to be a light read about a tender relationship between a spirited grandmother and her granddaughter, a small town, and chickens. It was all that, but much more. The book explores the strained relationship between two very different girls who have a terrible family tragedy in common. Both deal with their grief in opposite ways, carrying the weight of guilt and blame. There is plenty of comic relief to make the book a pleasure to read mixed with the absolute reality of conflict between two young girls.	2004-07-27

This is an amazing first novel with a complex plot line that has been artfully crafted.<br />The time travel genre requires the reader to suspend disbelief, and I think this one is as plausible as any I have read before. The notion that Henry's &quot;disorder&quot; is a combination of genetics and response to stress was rather believable, when you consider something as extreme as multiple personality disorder, for example. It was certainly more credible than the &quot;think system&quot; utilized by Jack Finney in his time travel books, which are nonetheless among my favorites.<br />The love story of Henry and Clare transcends time, and the characters are so much more complex and interesting because they have to contend with the extraordinary challenges and advantages of Henry's involuntary travels across time and space. While there were a few loose ends and remaining questions that weren't quite resolved in my mind, I was very much moved by the story, which comes full circle to a mostly satisfying conclusion.	2004-07-19

I purchased this book for our school library hoping to add historical information as well as to provide our L.D.S. students with a sense of their legacy. While I understand that the book is intended to be a simple introduction to the topic, the presentation overwhelmingly implies that the Mormon pioneers who blazed the trail had no redeeming social value whatsoever. The first page of text states that \\"Many people disliked them because of their different beliefs,\\" and the next page highlights the phrase from Governor Boggs's extermination order stating: \\"The Mormons must be treated as enemies and must all be terminated or driven from the state if necessary for the public health.\\" The picture of Nauvoo, Illinois, is a scene of chaos. While these statements and images are \\"true,\\" no information is provided on the other side of the issue, such as Governor Boggs's obligation to protect all the people of his state, including the Smith brothers who were murdered there, or the fact that the Mormons transformed a piece of unwanted swampland into a beautiful and thriving city, rivaling the population of Chicago at the time, from which they were ultimately evicted.  A misleading statement about Brigham Young's pioneer company, specified as a \\"small group\\" (referring to his immediate group) fails to credit him with the herculean task of engineering the movement of 70,000 pioneers to the Salt Lake Valley.  The author seems to grant a token only once toward the end of the book by referring to the pioneers as \\"brave\\" . <br />I do not recommend this book as a good source of balanced information on this important part of the Westward Movement. The bias of the author would lead a young reader with no other information with a very negative impression of Latter-day Saints.	2004-07-06

Jack's narrative takes us on his adventures that center around his Pack of apedogs (human family) and the gorgeous girl dog that moves in next door. Jack expresses the full range of canine emotions from \\"happy dog\\" to \\"sad dog\\" which are tied closely to whether he is deemed \\"good dog\\" or \\"bad dog,\\" and whether his tummy is full and is being rubbed. <br />Though he is not quite as brilliant as Lassie, this loveable Lab will make you laugh out loud by the way he interprets life.  The resident cats, who only barely tolerate Jack, interject their own superior commentaries in the footnotes for clarification. Illustrations, along with a \\"Jackspeak\\" glossary at the back of the book are helpful.<br />Patricia Finney, Jack's interpreter, took her inspiration from her own pets, as well as Rudyard Kipling's \\"Thy Servant, A Dog,\\" and also consulted books about dog psychology.	2004-03-27

Hattie's universe is permanently altered the summer she turns twelve, when for the first time she meets her 21-year-old mentally ill Uncle Adam, of whom no one in the family had ever mentioned previously.  His presence disrupts the orderly life of her wealthy and controlling grandparents, who are left with no other option than to accept him back into their home when his school closes. Hattie, an introspective only child with few friends, feels alternately enchanted by Adam's childlike exuberance and concerned that she might be somehow \\"like him.\\" She becomes protective of him as she witnesses the cruel reaction of those who deem him a \\"freak.\\"<br />Ann Martin's authentic writing takes us back to 1960 with such details as rickrack as a fashion statement, nylons and garter belts, and \\"Dobie Gillis.\\" Her sympathetic treatment of the characters draws the reader into this poignant story, earning a well-deserved Newbery honor for 2003. <br />Though the reading level is listed as 9-12, I would offer a caution that the emotional content is rather mature for this age group. I consider this appropriate for middle school and older. Younger readers might find Betsy Byars' \\"The Summer of the Swans,\\" a book with similar themes, to be a bit more emotionally on target.	2003-01-31
US	52815395	R23TEY8PT9654W	0312195516	226874686	The Red Tent	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Very successful first novel--a good choice for book groups!	The highly distilled accounts from the Bible often leave the reader wanting much more, and Diamant's novel told from a female perspective satisfies that desire. What is lacking from the biblical version are details, characterization, and the feminine voice. We get all three in &quot;The Red Tent,&quot; providing plenty of fodder for discussion.<br />Some of the enigmas in the original text include the relationship between Jacob and Leah. How did Jacob react to his first wife after being duped by Laban? What possessed Rachel to steal her father's images? Those and others are answered by Diamant.  <br />While some of the characters rang true to their biblical personas in my mind, such as Laban (right on!), others seemed so divergent as to be almost unrecognizable. I particularly had trouble with Rebecca. A complex character, to be sure, who used subterfuge to see that Jacob received Isaac's blessing over Esau, she is portrayed as a charismatic prima donna with the power to heal. She is all but unapproachable by the other female members of her clan. It was hard to imagine the warm and gracious young maiden portrayed in the Bible could become such an aloof matriarch. I look forward to reading Orson Scott Card's &quot;Rebecca,&quot; (Women of Genesis series) for a comparison.<br />The weaknesses of the male characters are emphasized in &quot;The Red Tent,&quot; which should not come as a surprise, since the focus is female. The virtues of the prophets, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph, are challenged by Diamant. It was disheartening (and in direct contradiction to the Bible) to think of their characters being so flawed.<br />It is interesting to compare this book with Orson Scott Card's &quot;Sarah.&quot; Idolatry and pagan rites played such a significant role in each of these novels, particularly for the women. Surely both of these authors researched the period, and their agreement on the pervasiveness and practice of idolatry is confirming. Card points out that Asherath, the mother goddess, was a corruption of Mother Eve. It appears that there was a struggle for monotheism even within the tents of the Hebrew prophets.	2002-01-21

Though the author was very careful to provide balance about the Mormon pioneers and the black slavery issue, very little ink is given to the plight of the Indians. My concern is that young readers might be left with the brutal imagery voiced by a group of bullwhackers in a campfire scene about the fate of the Oatman family. Further atrocities are detailed, such as scalping, smashing the brains of infants and vivisecting pregnant women. Later, there is a scene in which white &quot;gentlemen of means&quot; shoot into a group of sitting Indian women for sport, killing a mother and her baby. Perhaps this counteracts the three pages of discussion about the savage nature of the Natives, but I was left feeling that Levitin could have either excluded some of the gory details or have given a little more information to provide balance on the side of the oppression of the Indians.	2001-11-25

The level of discipline and high standards of behavior demanded by Captain Cook were equally impressive.

Whatever Virginia Hamilton, Leo &amp; Diane Dillon touch turn to gold!  Hamilton's creative use of language and dialect give this retelling of the Rumplestiltskin story a sense of freshness and fun.  The rich illustrations and the whimsical portrayal of the Lit'mahn character complement the text beautifully.  As a read-aloud, the  experience is delightful for both the reader and the audience.	2001-02-16
US	52815395	R3RSKP0OVLU1MR	0689836015	835820403	Silent To The Bone	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Serious themes for mature young readers	As a general rule, Konigsburg's characters are gifted, introspective and mature beyond their years, and I suspect that the young readers who enjoy her work strongly identify with these characters. This book is no exception.  Connor, who relates the story, is quick-witted and discerning as is Branwell, his friend, whose personal trauma has left him mute.  The themes of child abuse, sexuality, divorce, and family dysfunction are serious and are probably more suitable to a junior- and senior-high audience, though the main characters are just thirteen years old.  &quot;Silent to the Bone&quot; is definitely a page-turner; I found myself stealing moments to finish reading it.  While some of the plot details may not ring entirely true, Konigsburg has written a compelling novel which is certainly worthwhile reading.	2001-02-16

Fremont.  Though she is intelligent and has received some education, she dares not allow these people to know that she is able to speak.  Still grieving over the loss of her Arapaho mother, she is left alone in this hostile and unfamiliar environment in Saint Louis, taking comfort only in her &quot;Ma doll,&quot; who seems to communicate with her in her silent world, a few other remnants of her former life, and a mutually-understanding relationship which she develops with the family's slave, Caddie.  When Adaline finally breaks away from this unbearable life, her courage and strength are tested even further.  The author's careful research has provided an accurate historical backdrop for this fictionalized account.  Told from Adaline's point of view, the author skillfully creates a voice for this character with whom the reader can both sympathize and admire.  The ending comes together perhaps a little bit too neatly to be believable, but it does not detract from the overall appeal of the book.	2001-02-10

After I gave a booktalk to a group of elementary school students about this book, there was an undercurrent of excitement and comments like &quot;So-and-so has ADHD,&quot; or even &quot;Wow!  I have ADHD!&quot;  It is so comforting and validating to be able to read about a character who portrays what you are experiencing, and Jack Gantos does an outstanding job of making Joey real.  Often the reality of Joey's world is harsh, but there is sufficient comic relief to make reading about him bearable.  He is a character for whom you instantly feel empathy and with whom many kids will be able to identify.	2001-01-26

Drawing upon her own family's experience, Patricia Polacco shares a story of true holiday giving.  Her Russian grandparents teach the meaning of friendship and miracles as they relate the story of Hanukkah and as they reach out to their Christian neighbors who are suffering from a deadly epidemic of scarlet fever. They adapt the symbols of their Jewish celebration to bring Christmas to those who are too ill to create their own festivities.  Polacco's colorful illustrations capture the warmth and spirit of the characters and do much to enhance this wonderful story.	2000-12-28

She has presented a fictionalized account of her own grandmother's fall from wealth and privilege in the aftermath of the revolution in Mexico as she immigrated to the United States to work in a Mexican farm labor camp during the Great Depression.  Esperanza, the young protagonist, experiences loss, poverty, separation, prejudice, humiliation and fear on the road to her ultimate rise from the ashes in the manner of the mythical phoenix. Ryan does an excellent job of presenting the dilemma and danger of early attempts to improve the working conditions of the laborer during this period.  She points out in the author's notes the grave injustices incurred by the Mexican Deportation Act, which exceeded relocations of the Japanese-Americans during the 2nd World War and of the Native Americans of the previous century.  Many of these issues of prejudice and injustice persist today.  Adults who enjoy this wonderful children's book should be sure to read &quot;Rain of Gold,&quot; by Villasenor.	2000-12-19

London captures the imagery of sunlight and moonlight as a child's day unfolds and awakens his senses to the world around him.  One can almost hear the duet of the whistle of the teakettle and the sizzle of frying bacon as slippers &quot;whisper&quot; across the kitchen floor.

When Opal claims ownership of the mangy dog who has created chaos of the produce department of the local Winn-Dixie grocery store, her life is about to take a turn for the better. Opal's newly-adopted canine, who smiles showing all his teeth until he sneezes, becomes the catalyst for her to meet and befriend a cast of new friends in Naomi, Florida.  Perhaps the most unforgettable of all the characters is Winn-Dixie himself.  Fortunately, this is one dog story in which the dog doesn't suffer a tragic fate.	2000-11-21

Meanwhile, the rest of the one hundred-year-old doll family escape the discomfort of reality by engaging in sing-alongs of sixties' tunes, such as &quot;RESPECT,&quot; and &quot;Natural Woman.&quot;  Perhaps the appealing illustrations carry the book, but the subtle humor in the storyline certainly keep it going.	2000-11-10

It is a retelling of the Jewish folktale that has become familiar through the Caldecott award winner, &quot;Joseph Had A Little Overcoat.&quot;  The illustrations provide an intimate dollhouse view inside Joseph's home, including a parallel story that goes on under the house among a family of mice who become the resourceful recipients of the scraps of fabric that fall through the cracks in the floor.  The text is repetitive and invite choral participation on the part of the listeners.  Joseph's undying confidence in his grandfather's ability to salvage his beloved blanket-turned-jacked-turned-vest, etc. holds out until at last he loses the last prized button.  Nevertheless, Joseph seems to have inherited some of Grandfather's abilities to create something from almost nothing.	2000-10-28

US	52815395	R1X5M7BWZTC833	0679879269	731430286	The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials, Book 3)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	In my opinion, NOT a children's book	I have grappled with whether or not I consider this series to be appropriate for children and have concluded, after reading the final installment, that it is not.  The first volume, The Golden Compass, received the Carnegie Medal, the highest award for children's literature in England.  Other than having pre-adolescent protagonists, the books seem far too intense and mature in theme for most children of that age. Parents who are concerned that Harry Potter is the antichrist (and I adore the Potter books!) need to steer their children far from His Dark Materials.  Pullman is a masterful and gifted storyteller, but his objective seems to be to promote his atheistic point of view.  As the grandchild of a Church of England clergyman, Pullman is well acquainted with both the scriptures and the liturgy.  He has turned his back on his Christian heritage and has created an alternate, twisted humanistic theology in which God (the Authority) is a fraud and is ultimately destroyed, Enoch is portrayed as an evil, villanous killer-angel, and yet an innocent sacrifice is required to overcome death.  Pullman celebrates the wonders of human flesh perhaps without realizing that some followers of Christ recognize the great advantage and blessing of the human body as the temple of God with eternal potential. Pullman's concept of triumph over death involves a dispersion of atoms into the universe, rather than the reuniting of spirit and body in the resurrection.  His storyline borrows from Christ's adage that &quot;the truth will set you free.&quot;  Pullman has stated that his purpose in writing His Dark Materials was, in part, to provide an alternative to the religious propaganda such as what C.S. Lewis has written. (See the cover story interview in October, 2000 School Library Journal.)	2000-10-23
