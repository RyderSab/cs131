It has a little paranormal element to it, very likeable main characters; fun, entertaining secondary characters; an interesting storyline.  It was the first book in a while that I was really interested in how the story would work out & how it would end. <br />  <br />If you like historical romance, like light mysteries, like a little paranormal in your books, then definitely give this a try.  I'll definitely be trying more of Patricia Rice's Magic Series.  Very entertaining! <br />	2005-07-17

Yes, I agree that Joan wasn't a perfect human being - but hey.... who is?  I, personally, really enjoyed her & Mike's banter & struggles to come to grips with the relationship.  SB brought it all together at just the right time for me... I was just begining to have enough of Joan's problems. <br />As usual, I just loved the remembrances from WWII - those are always the sweetest love stories ever.... thank you so much SB! <br />Now, I can see why some others that haven't read the series in order are NOT very impressed with Sam.... he didn't make any points with me in this one either.  However, there are usually messes in real peoples lives that they have caused, are paying the price for  & then have to clean up - that's what is happening with Sam.  At least he is working on cleaning it up & as with real life, he's paying the price for his past mistakes. <br />I'll have to say that I was shocked that this doesn't not have at least 4 1/2 stars... it was a very entertaining romance to me.  As usual, I can't wait for the next one. <br />	2004-10-26

Pretty cute book, hero is definitely a hunk, heroine is very likeable, intelligent, person (her twins are just toooo cute).  Umm... don't think this one will be on my keepers shelf; it's really hard to say why - it just didn't grab hold of me.  I usually finish a keeper in 1 to 2 days, this one was easy to lay down over &amp; over again - it took me 4 days to read it. I probably would have given it a 3 1/2 stars if that was an option.  I did enjoy many parts of it though so I'm not saying it was a bad read; It just didn't have that special something.  I guess it didn't sit well with me that Jorund wasn't more amazed by the everyday conveniences (sp?) in the twenty-first century; Also, there were a number of other characters in the book who we had came to know a little &amp; then they were just kind of dropped.... thought their story should have been completed just a little bit at least.  However, as you can see, it has really good reviews here on Amazon, so if you like Vikings &amp; time-travel then do give it a try.	2003-10-01

This was a good one.... very sweet (&amp; hot!) romance, good story about a town that needed redemption.  Just loved both the hero, Wolf, and his son, Joe.... their life, their values (Wolf's body... lol); was so grateful to see them get what they really deserved out of life - it gave me that warm, fuzzy feeling that I just love.  Really liked the heroine, Mary; although she was a bit naive in some respects, I thought she really deserved the title 'heroine'....  I greatly admired her courage.  Her attention to, respect for, and relationship with Wolf's son, Joe, was just awesome also.  I can never say enough about the respect people deserve who take the time to develop those type of relationships with step-kids or kids that have hurt that bad.  LH won me over to Mary's character right away with Mary's concern and consideration for Joe.  <BR>I would recommend this one to anyone that likes to have a warm fuzzy feeling when the book is over......	2003-09-22

(Although I will have to admit that it's been a while since I've read the other two... 'Going Overbaord' and 'My Spy').  'Hot Pursuit' kept me entertained with all the things I look for in a action romance - action, adventure, quick wit, sexy-as-all-get-out hero, intelligent heroine (except once in this story), very hot, hot love scenes (enough to make this girl fan herself!).  The ending was well-rounded and really surprised me - but I'll have to admit that one of my questions was not answered...but I can't say what it was or it would be a spoiler.<BR>Anyway, if you like fast action romance, do this one!	2003-09-22

It is a classic Julia Quinn &amp; I totally enjoyed it.  The characters were smart &amp; funny &amp; were delightful to get to know.  It is light on the plot - but that's exactly what I was looking for this time.  I liked the fact that even though there were problems to solve, misunderstandings, arrogance &amp; stubborness to get through - JQ did not take it overboard &amp; make the characters childish, immature, or borish.  I enjoyed watching them get to know each other &amp; it was fun watching them enjoy each other; it's one of those that showed me why they fell in love.  The love scenes were so very, very sweet (uh.... well... sweet &amp; hot, if THAT makes any sense! lol)  The secondary characters were just great &amp; added a lot to the story; And I laughed out loud more than once at various ones antics.  The villian was a tad stupid - but that's ok, I'm burnt out on evil right now - so stupid was good (lol  lol).  If you like simple, fun historicals, then do not miss this one.  Guess I need to go &amp; check to make sure I haven't missed any other JQ books.	2003-09-17

I'll have to say that I really liked the idea for the new series... the storyline was great, I really enjoyed the action, the suspense, ALL the men in the team, the secondary characters in Lily's family, Ryland &amp; Lily - &amp; their romance... However, it went on and on and on and on about what they were thinking &amp; feeling about each other.  That gets so old - so fast.  I did major skimming to get through what they thought &amp; felt about each other... in fact, it was almost hard to finish the book.  I do want to try CF's next installment of the series, but I surely hope it doesn't have this much thinking in it!  (p.s. If you want to get into the new series, I think this book will be a must.)	2003-09-14

Not only was it original, but down right unusual.  And - I laughed out loud so many times I can't count them all.  One of my girls even noticed and had to come ask me what was up.  I guess I would have to say that the 'misunderstandings' between both the main characters weren't that convincing to me - meaning that I didn't see the need to get as upset as they did.  However, I didn't allow it to cloud my enjoyment of the book.  It was a really good romance, a really fun read, had lots a good secondary characters, had good descriptions of the town &amp; the bayou..... all in all a worthwhile way to spend my reading time.  I've already picked up more of her work.... she's worth it!<BR>FYI - I found out after I read this one that 'The Love Potion' actually came first.  I should have read it first.... however, that didn't affect my enjoyment of this book.	2003-09-05

It starts out in 'Fantasy Lover', then 'Night Pleasures'.  It's definitely a fantasy type book - dealing in Gods, vampires, & Dark-Hunters (vampire hunters).  I believe that if you wanted to read the series, this one is pretty important to read before the next ones coming out due to the fact that it gives you lots of info on characters of the books following.  I have enjoyed the action in these books, but I do an awful lot of skimming due to the fact that there's too much 'he thought about her.....' for 4 paragraphs, 'she thought about him.....' for 4 paragraphs.  That's one of my pet peeves in romance books, so it kinda disappoints me in these last 2 books.<BR>However, the hero's in these books are just to die for..... tall, gorgeous, sexy-as-[...], not to mention super-human!  In fact, this one had so many of them that I couldn't decide which one was best!  lol  So - I just bet that I can suffer through the next book in the series!  lol  They are also 'tortured' hero's.  In some books that doesn't go over well with me - usually due to the fact that the hero's personality is adversely affected by it; But, that doesn't hold true in these books.<BR>I'll have to say that Sunshine (our heroine) was a little fruity & didn't always show a great deal of common sense.... I wasn't that impressed with her intelligence.  <BR>There is a lot of action in these books, which I always like, & there's lots of humor too.  There are loads of secondary characters that are an integral part of the story & really add too it.  I really like the setting, New Orleans, although SK doesn't give me as good of a 'feel' for the color of the city as other authors I have read.  If you like fantasy romance, then give them a try.	2003-08-29

I only made it through the first story. I was sooooo bloomin' frustrated at the end of that one story!  The story line was excellent - or could have been.  There was a slight new twist, or maybe I should say, new information concerning the history of the Carpathians, or actually about time even before the Carpathians.... when the wizards ruled... it was sounding really good.... but it was sooooo short!  Yes, I enjoyed the story..... there just wasn't enough of it.  I truly wish this had been a full length novel....	2003-08-29

Not your typical murder/mystery/shoot-em-up action type - but these 2 definitely had an adventure together - no denying that!  However, just know that the romance is the primary story.  I really ended up liking both the characters in this story.  At first I wasn't sure I would; Our heroine, Jenna, did the old 'I've had a bad life, so I'm going to be a ***** to you' attitude.... I usually hate those stories.  However, DK did a good job of making Jenna human, her fears understandable, &amp; allowed her to come around to acting human fairly quickly.  That really saved the story for me.<BR>T.J. sounds like more of a man that actually exists in the real world..... (oh my!)    However, real or not, I definitely enjoyed the little fantasy!  lol<BR>The plot was a new one for me, that's always great, the humor was very enjoyable, and the ending was interesting.  All in all, a good romance.  If you haven't tried Donna Kauffman, this one would be a good one to start with.	2003-08-29

I guess I'll have to say that I liked 'The Dark Highlander' better, but that's not to say that this one isn't a keeper.  However, if you haven't read either of them I would suggest reading this one first.  It's definitely a prologue to 'The Dark Highlander'.  Gwen was a hoot!  I loved the 'falling out the window scene' & about died laughing at the 'cherry tree chopper-downer'!!!!!  lol  lol   I still chuckle when I think of that!  And talk about your tall, dark, handsome hero!  Ohmygosh!!!  This one's enough to drool over!<BR>This is a time-travel (present day & the 1500's).  It also touches on the Druids of ancient Scotland.  That stuff is interesting to me.<BR>I really liked the way KMM wrapped this all up also.  It didn't leave anything out, didn't rush, left you hanging for a little while.  The ending was a complete surprise too - not that they lived happily ever after - but the manner in which they got back together.  KMM did another excellent job!	2003-08-29

I am not refering to financial or physical aspects either!  They would not have had half the trouble they did if she had just believed in him a little more!  (of course the story would have been MUCH shorter!  lol)  However, other than that she was a good character.<BR>I totally loved Sax &amp; all of his misfit household.  They were such an enjoyable &amp; fun group.<BR>This was a different flavor of Regency than I'm use to reading.  I'll have to say though that it was a nice change of pace.

Good plot, interesting and likeable characters.  I'll have to say that the suspense and action weren't quite as good in this one as previous ones I've read, but it's still good.  Actually, it started out really suspenseful - had me raising my eyebrows first thing.... however, the further along in the book I got, the less suspense there was.  She didn't fool me at all with the twist at the end - had it figured out.  Still yet, I enjoyed it.... the romance was good, the paranormal aspect was interesting (although I never had my questions answered), and it was an original plot.  If you like LH, go ahead and read it for those reasons, if not the suspense.  Honestly have to say that it's a 4 star romance, but only a 3 star suspense.	2003-08-29

Loved watching Saint come around - didn't like him AT ALL at the very first of the book, but he really shaped up great as he fell for Evelyn.  His interactions througout the book with his butler was just too funny.  Also, it was great to see Evelyn grow &amp; come to realize how fulfilling life can be.  Her 'big idea' (which I  can't name or it'll spoil it) was quite ridiculous - but it definitely got Saint's attention!  lol  These were 2 that I wanted to get together..... they were just wonderful for each other.<BR>The only small problem that I had with the book was Evelyn's attitude about her brother; she continually claimed that he really loved her &amp; that he would be excellent as a member of Parliment....... uh, excuse me???  Whatever gave her these notions????  I suppose that her reactions for those times may have been realistic, but to me it just seemed she had no backbone when it came to her brother.  It was hard to accept that the meek mouse being lead around by the nose by her brother is also the same woman that helped the orphans come up with their scheme concerning Saint.  That got quite irritating to me.<BR>However, every other aspect of the book was in turn fun &amp; sweet; if you like historical romance, you'll most likely enjoy this one.	2003-08-14

Excellent romance, suspense, and total action &amp; adventure.  LH has done some excellent writing in this one.  (Just a note to those it matters to: The romance is somewhat 2nd place in this one.) All of the characters are somewhat complex - but she doesn't take it so far that I couldn't get to know them.<BR>When I read about John Medina in 'Kill And Tell', I just knew that his would be an excellent story..... it is!  Although some of his decisions seemed quite cold, I just couldn't help but be glad that there is 'someone' out there to make those kinds of decisions.  Although John doesn't really have a clue how to handle personal relationships, he does know how to act towards people with respect.... that's a real biggy in my opinion.  <BR>I really, really enjoyed Niema, our heroine... she is definitely heroine material.  This was one of those scarce books that gives me a good reason for the changes that Niema made in her life 5 yrs ago.... &amp; justifies the fear she has of falling for John..... didn't blame her a bit on either one.  She was incredibly smart, had loads of common sense, &amp; Did Not allow her past to be an excuse for blaming others nor for acting like a royal witch.... inspite of everything she was a very likable person.<BR>The villian in this book, Louis Rosnard, is unlike any other I have read about.  His is a very interesting twist.  Yes, I had to condemn him for his actions...... however...... hmmm... can't go there or I'll give anyway part of the story.  Anyway, it's a very interesting twist on a villan &amp; I really wonder if we'll see him again in future books.<BR>Really enjoyed it, if you like action &amp; suspense with your romance, I think you will also.	2003-08-13

Okay, after re-reading this post, I decided it's a bit of a spoiler...... but don't worry you DON'T want to read the book anyway!!!!!<br />I was shocked plum down to my toes by this one!  It's still hard to accept that Linda Howard wrote this book!  Unfortunately, I now have to say that I have read a LH book that I couldn't stand..... sad, but true.<BR>The heroine, Sallie, described herself as 'foolish &amp; weak'..... I not only agreed with her, but added a few adjectives of my own! <br />Without telling too much of the story, (which wouldn't matter, cause you wouldn't want to read it anyway!) - This man, Rhy, walked out on her 7 yrs earlier saying she wasn't 'woman enough' for him AND that he only married her out of pity !!!!!!!!, never sees her for 7 yrs., then after she has worked hard as heck to make herself a really good, successful, fulfilling life, loses weight &amp; becomes all beautiful, he walks back into her life, says she 'belongs' to him, takes away everything that she enjoys AND SHE LETS HIM GET AWAY WITH IT!!!!<BR>Next she falls for the oldest lie in the book by a woman she already KNOWS is a conviving witch.... give me a break!<BR>I did not find one redeeming quality in our so-called hero (or the entire book actually)..... he was a self-centered, selfish, egotistical, heartless jerk - with VERY violent tendencies! Even his supposedly heartfelt discussion at the end of the book did nothing for me.<BR>After reading this one, I had to run out &amp; pick up 'All the Queen's Men' real fast &amp; read it - just to assure myself that I still liked LH!

Well, I call it a love story, but actually the story itself is more about the good vs. evil plot.  Once again, Linda Howard has written an excellent story.  It has most everything I love in a romance novel - suspence, non-stop action/adventure, a sweet but very intelligent heroine (who learns all about taking care of herself), a tall, dark, gorgeous, sexy as **** hero, a great storyline, very hot love scenes; there is also an unexpected paranormal element  (sp?) that I've never read in LH books, but that I really enjoyed.  (Man, to have dreams like THAT! lol)  I really liked the way LH let me come to really know the characters... I knew just exactly how Grace St. John felt & why she felt that way; I knew about her life & her feelings for those around her.  It was the same with Niall of Scotland - I could feel his anger, his pain, his aloneness, his feelings for Grace... oh man (big sigh).<br />The romance in this book bloomed slowly, well over the course of the book - from 7 centuries apart.... no rush to fall in bed & fall in love based on what happened in bed.  I really enjoyed that.  (Rushed feelings about love after falling in lust tend to make me roll my eyes.)  I really appreciated the fact that Grace didn't just forget about what her husband had meant to her... her love for him was not diminshed by her feelings for Niall.<br />LH also wrote about a number of secondary characters that I could really get to know & appreciate also... they all had an integral part of the story.<br />If you like action/adventure in your romances - this one should certainly trip-your-trigger; it kept moving, threw in lots of unexpected surprises, & really kept me enthralled.  A definite recommend.	2003-08-03

Both the hero &amp; heroine were 'superhero' types.  I like that because it gave a lot of intelligence to both characters (characters that make stupid decisions annoy me).  However, I do wish there had been a bit more time spent on the sub-plot instead of just the romance part.  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the way the hero &amp; heroine spent time actually talking (instead of just jumping in &amp; out of bed), but if DK had spent less time on what they were thinking about each other &amp; used that time on the sub-plot it would have made this a 5 star read instead of a 4 star.  This is a 5 yr old book though &amp; from what I've read on DK she just keeps getting better - so I'll definitely be buying more of her books.	2003-07-31

Oh man, another great big sigh caused by a Lisa Kleypas historical.... once again she's written a truly wonderful love story.  <BR>The heroine was a little unbelievably naive, but she was so sweet &amp; determined that it didn't really bother me.  I will say though that it wouldn't have bothered me a bit if she had 'put her foot down' with Logan a little sooner.  (If you've read it, you know what I'm talking about.) Although Logan was a tortured hero, he was a wonderful one!  Usually 'tortured' heros are so cold &amp; unfeeling that I can't get to know them; Not so with LK's heros!  While LK was telling me about the facade he was showing the rest of the world, she was also letting me get to know him (&amp; fall head-over-heels for him! lol) by letting me in on what he was really thinking &amp; feeling - I did get quite ticked off at him a couple of times, but LK did a wonderful job of giving Maddy (&amp; me!) reason to make up with him. lol<BR>As with all of LK's historicals, she wrote a good plot, a good secondary story line, &amp; a whole host of great secondary characters that really add to the story.  The emotions in this book just jumped off the page for me.  LK's heros just neeeeed someone to take care of &amp; love them, &amp; the heroines just do a wonderful job of that.  Once again, LK left me with a great big sigh.  These type books are the very reason I read historical romance.  I can't wait to find another one by her.	2003-07-28

'Action-packed' is another good description.  This one, like Kiss and Tell, never stops moving.  Unfortunately, 'far fetched' might fit too.  Delanie's reason for being in the jungle, how she got there, and the part she was playing didn't sit well with me at all.  A kindergarten teacher???  Nah!  Supposedly she was only 'playing' a bimbo.... some of her actions convinced me that she really was!  I just have a problem with regular everyday women walking into what they know is a life threatening situation & making stupid decisions..... Delanie did this often.  I like a little common sense & brain usage in my heroines.<BR>Now Kyle was a great action hero.  His reasons for being there & the way he came to be were believable and he played his role quite well.  The way CA descibed him was just awesome....  Now I did have a small problem with the fact that he couldn't keep his pants zipped at a couple a really important times... a person would think that a man in his position would have a little more self-control that that.... but oh well, this is fiction read for fun, right?!<BR>All in all though, I enjoyed reading this one.  It was an original storyline (for a romance novel anyway), the hero was to die for, and it never let me get bored (which is very important to me).  If you liked CA's 'Kiss and Tell', I'd think you'll probably like this one also	2003-07-28

This lady always comes up with some really original tales.  I will have to say that I don't care for the antagonistic approach that she used between the 2 main characters; That is something that bunches of readers enjoy - but not me.  Parts of this one were really funny, but I don't care for it when they spend all night long making love, then wake up the next morning &amp; decide they have to save-face by spouting off the most offensive thing they can think of...... that really annoys me.  However, SEP did save me from a real let-down by also writing about the good times they had together.  They spent time getting to know each other &amp; acting like civilized beings.  My favorite romances are ones like this one where I can actually see why the main characters are falling in love.<BR>SEP also put in really good secondary characters (as usal).  I simply loved Cal's family... especially his grandmother!<BR>Although this one won't be on my keepers shelf, it's still a pretty good read.  If you like SEP, then definitely read it.	2003-07-18
US	41609612	R3V85XR1BA5RYH	038078145X	15276320	Stranger in My Arms	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Loved it! (as usual)	Oh man...... (big sigh!)..... another wonderful, sweet, (hot!) love story by LK!!!  She writes about some of the most down to earth characters I've ever read about.  The hero in this one, Hunter, was not only gorgeous & sexy as they come.... but his thoughts on life are almost heart-wrenching..... I just fell head over heals for him.  I will admit that there were a couple of holes in the story concerning him.... but not enough to make it glaringly obvious.<BR>Lara, our heroine, did get a little annoying to me.  She claimed she wanted independence, but didn't mind using Hunter on more than one occassion.  Her personality was kind of contradictory (sp?) - she was suppose to be overly compassionate & extremely good hearted to everyone in the village & to orphans (even to her disgusting relatives) - but she was completely cold & manipulative with Hunter.  I think that maybe LK just didn't give me enough of a feel for Lara's bad feelings towards him; Not like him ok - but not the disgust she felt.  I also got a little tired of her playing the tease & then saying 'Nope!  I've changed my mind'... not cool.  However, the story kept me interested enough that I didn't get bogged down in it.  <BR>Anyway, that said, I still don't think that you can beat a LK historical for sweet, sweet love stories.  I also loved the twists & turns LK put in this one.  As usual, Lk wrote a fabulous ending - she never wraps them up too fast & always leaves me with a great big sigh.  I definitely recommend this one of lovers of historical romance - especially if you like the sweet (& hot!) kind.	2003-07-07
US	41609612	R1R8R7CVIOE51G	1575668041	21470983	Tempting	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Not much romance or erotica....	This one just didn't have what it takes for me.... I didn't get the feeling of romance, & with a couple light examples of erotica, I didn't find that either.  It was just sex.... sex... and more sex.  Christina basically decided to get back at her husband for his infidelity & grabbed the first man available (Max), they had sex immediately & 4 or 5 more times in a row, decided they were in love..... & it went on from there.  Now don't get me wrong - I do enjoy a hot romance & I also enjoy erotica; I just found extremely little of either in this book.... just lots & lots of sex.  I had a problem with a couple of the decisions Christina & Max made also.... I can't really say without spoiling the story... just suffice to say - the decisions were totally unacceptable for that era.... & if Christina's husband was the jerk he was portrayed to be, he'd have really hurt her over it.  Also, the way it worked out for them in the end was just way to convenient to be believed.  I gave it 2 stars because I have read worse - I just expected more out of SJ.	2003-07-03

This is an anthology, which I usually don't read at all.  I generally can't get into the romance before it's already over &amp; there's never enough of a side story to keep me interested.  That definitely did not pertain to this one though.  I only read this one because I love Julia Quinn's Lady Whistledown &amp; it had been recommended.  I just loved how they entertwined the stories.  Not only that, but I liked each story individually.  Every one of the characters were enjoyable, some witty, some more serious - but always entertaining.  I have never read Karen Hawkins or Mia Ryan - but I hope these stories are accurate examples of their books; If so, then I've found 2 new authors.  If you like Julia Quinn type Regencys, I bet you'll like this one also.	2003-06-30

I can say that I liked the storyline... very original.  I liked both leading characters; they were likable, strong, and had integrity; I also enjoyed the way they actually communicated with each other - which is often not the case in romance books &amp; that can really iritate me.  Also, this was a book in which you actually saw the reasons that the lead characters fell in love with each other - NOT one of those where lust seemed to be the only reason.  The secondary characters &amp; side story really added quite a bit to the whole - I always appreciate that in a romance book.  I would have liked to have known how the Earl handled that last meeting that they were headed into when the story ended... I thought that was dropped too abruptly.  The Earl's secret made him very personable for me &amp; really pulled at my heart-strings sometimes; However, I was extremely disappointed that we didn't learn anything about what the problem was a result of or how Hollie was going to help him overcome it.... I really wanted more info there.<BR>My main problem with this book was that it was way, way too wordy (is that a word??? lol).  I did a whole lot of skimming just to get to the point several times through out the book &amp; often skimmed over what they were thinking of each other (again &amp; again &amp; again).  That's never entertaining to me.  Also, I had a problem with a few situations where the social customs (her presence in his home unchaparoned &amp; them calling each other by first names) &amp; even legalities of that time period were completely ignored (The Earl naming his heir).... that made it quite unbelievable.<BR>I have read Linda Needham books before that I didn't want to skim over anything at all.... I was awfully disappointed in this one for that very reason.  If it hadn't been for that, I would have definitely given this one 4 stars.	2003-06-26
US	41609612	R33R6HPUIDTYD8	0373484933	279978210	A Game Of Chance	Books	5	1	3	N	N	This is the reason I read....	I have to say that this book was simply great- it's the reason I read romance with action & adventure in them.  It moved non-stop from beginning to end & had a great romance also!  Although Chance & Sunny did fall in love a little fast, LH did give them both personalities that deserved it..... I had no problem understanding why they would fall in love with each other.  Sunny was very spirited, brave & determined - she also showed intelligence (not the nitwit characteristics that too many authors use for lead female characters).... & she was great fun (which was amazing due to the life she had led).  Chance was definitely your hardcore type hero, but also sexy as they come & had a great sense of humor (which is not common enough in lead male characters). Now personally, I wouldn't have minded Sunny making him sweat a little more after she found out his secret.... but, oh well, he's worth it!  lol  The witty dialogue & the teasing by both Sunny & Chance kept me totally amused & the sexual tension was intense without taking up too much of the story.  There was a lot more to the story than just that.<BR>I think that maybe the ending was just a tad rushed, but not enough to ruin the book for me.  I can't believe that there's a whole series of McKenzie books that I've been missing!  Now I can't wait to get to the book store!	2003-06-25
US	41609612	RC5EAYSOEF5UR	0671524208	651219221	Deep Waters	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Classic JAK	Very classic JAK reading.  I really enjoyed it - though it's not one of my favorite JAK's.  I've always liked the small, northwest coastal town settings that JAK often uses.  Typical of mid-90's JAK books, this one was a murder mystery without the spine-tingling effect.... just light mystery with a fun romance.  I like reading this type after having read a couple of heavier much more serious murder mysteries.<BR>Our heroine, Charity, was very personable, easy going, & likeable; Not a nitwit like a lot of authors would have made her out to be, but also not too serious nor with a lot of hang-ups.  The hero, Elias, took a lot more effort to get to know.  At the first of the book, I had trouble feeling like I would get to know him at all.  I thought he was going to be a little over the top with the metaphysical stuff - but he started loosing up with Charity's help & by the end he was a much more personable & likeable fellow.  I often grinned at the way he would just sit back & let Charity take over a conversation with others.   <BR>As usual with JAK, the odd-ball secondary characters were quite off-the-wall, but that just adds more fun to the story for me.<BR>If you like classic JAK, I'd say you'll want to read 'Deep Waters'.	2003-06-24
US	41609612	R35EP2JQI924BV	0671568833	93588971	Kill and Tell	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Another 5 star by Linda Howard!	I really like how the story never slowed down & was always throwing in new people/new elements that I had to keep up with.  No skimming here!  You'd definitely miss something!<BR>I can't really call it a murder mystery, although there is lots of murder in it - because I knew who was behind the murders, I just didn't know why.  The suspense, however, kept my eyebrows raised more than once.   I suppose that the reason I could handle this book with all the murder & gore, when I can't handle others, is because this one didn't have the evil element that so many do.  No ritualistic killings, no torture, that kind of stuff - that type of thing IS NOT entertainment to me.  This was simply 'Bang - he's dead!'  lol  However, LH did describe  the after effects of the bang.... hence, NOT a light read.<BR>Anyway, the romance was really great also, definitely not fun & light-hearted, but really good (& really hot!)  I totally enjoyed LH's descriptions of New Orleans & the atmosphere she was able to conjure up for me.  It really made me want to go back to New Orleans & wander slowly through The Quarter. I will have to say that I thought Marc & Karen fell for each other a little too fast for reality.... but I really liked both characters & LH somehow made it ok with me.<BR>Ok, NOT my usual light, fun read.... but Linda Howard had me riveted anyway!  This one was just as good as the 2 previous books I read by LH (Mr. Perfect & Open Season) - but it did differ BIG in two ways:  The other 2 were mainly romances with a suspense/thriller story thrown in........ Kill and Tell is mainly a suspense/thriller with a romance thrown in; The other way it differed was that it was not a funny one like the other two.<BR>A definite recommend if you do murder/action/adventure/romance! (or whatever you call it! lol)	2003-06-19

This book was put out in 1996 &amp; it doesn't compare with her more recent novels.  I do believe that alot of historical romance readers would like it, but it just didn't thrill me.  As usual, LK wrote an original storyline; I really enjoyed reading about the lives of thespians.  As in her others novels, LK made the characters come to life for me.  There were a number of secondary characters that really added to the story &amp; the hero &amp; heroine were good people..... but it just took sooooooo long for them to come to grips with what each other wanted &amp; needed - it dragged on way too long.  I did major skimming in this one.  Also, the love scenes were not near as sweet &amp; sensual as LK's newer releases.  However, I've read enough wonderful LK books that I will definitely stay a loyal fan of hers.	2003-06-15

This lady REALLY knows how to write a good love story!  The story was very interesting, the characters believable, the hero & heroine intelligent & good to each other, the villan really nasty, & LK always wraps everything up really well.  I won't say that it tops a couple of LK's other books, but it's still a five star read for die-hard historical romance readers like myself.  As with all LK historicals I enjoyed the fact that although there was the 'big misunderstanding' to work thru, the main characters didn't act like complete jerks over it; Also, although the heroine seems to be somewhat naive, she didn't do stupid stuff just to prove that she could.  In other words, I like some intelligence in my characters - LK always, always gives me that.  Another constant in LK's writing is new plots & stories that keep moving; I don't have to read paragraph after paragraph after paragraph about what the main characters are thinking & feeling about each other - LK held true to that in this book also.  Also, another thing that has never disappointed me in LK books is the very, very sweet sensuality; although they are quite hot - they are some of the sweetest scenes I've ever read in historicals.  As usual, I can't wait to read my next LK book!	2003-06-13

However, it's not even close to her best work.  I did like the characters in the book for the most part.... our heroine kinda got stupid once (that's a spoiler though, so I won't go there).<BR>My main problem with the book was that it was wayyyyyyyy too wordy... descriptive sentences were in most every paragraph.... got boring.  I did like the plot it was kinda spine-tingling a couple of times.... but she didn't put as much effort into it as she could have &amp; when she wrapped it all up I had everything figured out except the actual name of the killer (which was a nobody anyway).  The conclusion was a let down for me.  Also, I didn't much care for the love scenes.... they just weren't romanctic... nor did they raise my eyebrows (lol)- kind of just thrown in there, ya know?  Anyway, diehard KR fans will probably want to go ahead &amp; read it - but don't get your expectations up.	2003-06-10
US	41609612	R34UYRN8F56DFV	0671027573	142020743	Mr. Perfect	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Almost perfect romance/mystery	Ohmy[...] This is the first time in a long while that a book has captivated me like this & the first time in a while that I have laughed this much.  Also, there was definitely no skimming paragraphs in this one.  However, halfway through, it got serious.... really serious.... psycho-killer type serious.... main characters dying type serious.  I can't say that it was a great mystery because the psycho was somewhat obvious to me about 3/4's of the way through the book, but it did have a weird twist at the end that had kept me guessing.  The romance was also great  [...].  Sam & Jaine's dialogue was lol funny.  I loved the fact that they didn't hate each other til the end of the book & then decided they loved each other... those type stories always irritate me.  It also had a couple of side stories of couples & their relationships - those weren't too evolved, but did add to the story.  I guess it would have been just too long & drawn out if LH had added too much more to their stories.  All in all, this is a must read for those who can stand a little murder & love fun romances.  It's not often that an author can wrap up this much fun with such a serious plot & make me like it.  LH has definitely done that.  I'm definitely going to pick up another Linda Howard book & I hope I've now found a new favorite author to read.	2003-06-03
US	41609612	RR1CYDQHER41O	0380782812	278313893	Season of Wishes	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Good storyline, but a little slow	This is one of the books in the Draycott Abbey series; I'm not reading them in order, so I don't know where this one fits in.  It was a pretty good read, but not as good as 'Bride in the Mist'.  It did have the suspense element & the paranormal element in it which I always enjoy, but this time I think CS focused way too much on just the hero & heroine's feelings & thoughts about each other.  This story moved rather slow for me & I really found myself wanting to skim paragraphs in this one (the ones that just described more & more feelings & thoughts about each other), where I didn't want to in the other one.  I wish CS had spent more time & effort on the action/adventure aspect & had put more into the paranormal memories from the past.  I didn't get that good of a picture of the past, nor feel any real feelings for those characters. However, I did really like both our hero & heroine (Ian & Jamee); Neither of them were annoying like so many characters of romance books are. Ian was definitely your strong, sexy Highlander & Jamee was intelligent & independent (without carrying it to stupidity). I enjoy the secondary characters that CS adds to these books & the way they are necessary & add to the story.  I do believe it's worth picking up & reading - and I will be trying another in this series.	2003-05-17

I do know that it is one of those books that I have never forgotten.  I don't always enjoy time-travel but this one made me laugh and made me cry.  I wasn't keeping any at the time I read it, but I did go buy it recently to reread &amp; keep.  Definitely a must for time-travel readers.	2003-05-15

I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed.  I just got tired of the &quot;she looked at him &amp; saw &amp; thought - &amp; he looked at her &amp; saw &amp; thought&quot;....... there were a whole bunch of pages where that is ALL that took place.  I had also read that is had a whole lot of humor in it; Although I did find a few places that were funny, I didn't find it humorous all the way thru like I had read.  I will have to admit that it probably takes more to make me laugh than it might others.  KM's 'The Dark Highlander' is still my absolute favorite!	2003-05-15

This was a wonderful romance (love story) & also had a very involved plot.  It kept moving, never allowing me to grow bored.  I will have to say that it had a touch of gore that I don't care for & had to skim over - but not enough to ruin the book for me.  It is set in the late 1500's when Elizabeth is on the throne in England & James is on the throne in Scotland.  Of course anything to do with that time period revolves around potential plots to overthrow a throne or two - this story is no exception.  However, IJ did it in a very different way.  The love story was really an enjoyable one to me.  The hero & heroine definitely had their differences to work out, but they didn't fight & hate each other all the way through the book like in so many of the stories from this timeframe.  (Also, I would be very remiss to not mention that a couple of the love scenes are enough to make a person fan herself & glance around to make sure no one else is looking!)  The heroine started out being a little too naive but she learned her lessons well & turned out to be such a wonderful lady.  The hero was a very hard man, as all of them had to be in that time, but he was exceptional from beginning to end (& a lover to die for!)  :)<BR>It's not your light reading type, but if you like a true love story with a very involved plot then don't miss this one!	2003-05-15

Of course I didn't know until I was halfway thru that it is a reprint of a 1986 Harlequin Temptation.  I guess JAK has just grown alot in her writing since then.  This was a pretty vintage JAK (which I usually absolutely love) -  big business man meets &amp; falls for artsy-craftsy small town girl.  Unfortunately, the characters weren't very well developed &amp; therefore it was pretty easy to not fall for our hero all that much.  In fact, he ruffled my feathers more than once.  Not the first recommendation I'd have for a JAK book.	2003-05-15

Don't know why I was expecting a lighter read than this - but I was.  It's not however a light read.  It deals with a minion of the devil himself.  Definitely not a nice character.  Can't deny that the story is a definite new twist; However, unfortunately, the author has spent way too much time describing Mike & Abigail's feelings for each other & thoughts about each other.  Kind of aggravating & gets a little boring.	2003-05-15

Really thought I'd like this since it's by IJ &amp; the plot sounded like a good one - However, it just didn't do it for me.  I just never was able to get involved with the characters - or even like them really.  The hero (Lionelle) could have been an ok guy - but there was never any connection with him emotionally for me.  The heroine was just a little too naive for the period &amp; situation the IJ had placed her in.  The romance nor the plot ever really did anything for me either.  I don't know.... it has a real good rating &amp; I know IJ is an excellent writer - so maybe it was just me.	2003-05-15

Without telling any of the story I'll just say that seldom do I really go for the reasons authors give for a character not wanting to have a relationship or fall in love; In this one, I could totally feel for Rachel.  In fact, if I had been in her shoes, I may not even be as 'together' as she was.  I really admired her for trying to keep going.<BR>I also really like Joe; he was such a down to earth kinda guy.  He is one of those that worked himself up from the bottom &amp; didn't let it go to his head.  I just liked his whole personality.<BR>I did, however, have a problem with the baby's mother... couldn't fall for her reasons for her actions at all.<BR>For those that like Christmas stories, this is a good one.	2003-05-15

I didn't like it as much as DJ's 'A Knight Of A Trillion Stars' though.  I had a problem with the fact (like so many other novels I've read) that the heroine was so obnoxious to the hero that I don't see why he kept trying with her.    However, it did have a number of fun scenes in it, some really good secondary characters, and very hot love scenes.  I would almost suggest reading it though just for the scene (no spoiler!) at the 'afternoon of embroidery'... ohmygosh.... I laughed out loud!!!	2003-05-15

It is written by Dara Joy & is a time-travel book as well.  A present day Deana is having a really, really awful day...... right up to the moment she gets home to find an alien in her living room.  (I'm sure she would have kicked him out if he hadn't been soooooo bloomin' sexy!)  A lot of people reviewed the story as 'laugh out loud' funny & although I'm a little harder to make laugh than most, I will say that I smiled & chuckled frequently thru out it.  (Now the 'morning after' the Transference was definitely 'laugh out loud' funny!  You'll just have to read it!)  More than once I really did want to tell our herione, Deana (or Adeanna as Lorgin, our super sexy hero, calls her) to pleeeease knock Lorgin in the head & MAKE him listen to her!  Anyway, it's a really cute love story and quite fast paced - you're never sitting still for a moment.

No mystery &amp; suspense like I've been reading lately, but I like a change of pace every once in a while.  If you've liked Julia Quinn's other historicals, you'll probably like this one also.  It's not as good as 'How To Marry A Marquis', but I still enjoyed it.  It's cute &amp; comical &amp; didn't do that &quot;she hates him, he hates her, til they fall in love&quot; thing that so many historicals do.  That's a relief to me.  I can't believe JQ actually reveiled Lady Whistledown in this one!  <BR>I think everyone needs a friendship like Penelope &amp; Eloise; I have one &amp; it lifts me up &amp; puts me back on track when I think nothing can.  Happy Reading!	2003-05-15

US	41609612	R1WKRAGQQY3NGW	0373834586	321239264	Rogues' Reform	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Enjoyable	This is 3 novels that were originally Harlequins released in the U.K.; (1) 'The Reasons for Marriage', (2) 'A Lady of Expectations', & (3) 'An Unwilling Conquest'.  They are all Regency romances about the Lester family.  I read the 1st one last spring, the story of Lenora the oldest sister & honestly don't remember it all that well.  I do remember that although I enjoyed it, it didn't impress me enough to go ahead & start the second one.<BR>Well, maybe I'm just in a different frame of mind, but I totally enjoyed the 2nd one, A Lady of Expectations.  It is not really what I expected from SL, but since I was not all that impressed with her 'Once Upon....' books, that's quite alright.  This one was a light read, the sensuality was much more subtle but totally enjoyable.  The humor wasn't lol funny, it was also subtle - but made me grin often.  It did contain the big 'communication problem' & misunderstaning plot - but this one didn't annoy me like most of them do.<BR>I loved Jack (our hero); his determined wooing of Sophie was wonderful.  His personality was so easy to fall in love with; although he was totally confused by Sophie's abrupt change of attitude, he still treated her with respect & I just loved the very mature way he handled everyone around him.  Sophie was a mature & very responsible lady & with one goofy exception, she also treated Jack with respect & tried to maintain their friendship even when she thought she couldn't possibly marry him.<BR>Also included in the story was a cute side story about Sophie's cousin & her beau, along with a small problem to handle.  I do wish that the other 2 Lester's had been a little more prominent in the story, but at least there were a number of secondary characters that added a good touch to the story.  I think I'll be putting this one on my keepers shelf.  If you can enjoy subtle humor, sweet romance instead of sex, & small problems instead of huge ones, then I believe you'll enjoy 'A Lady of Expectations'.	2003-05-15

I was a little disgusted with Ninian thru out most of the book; She just let everyone lead her around by the nose.  I did like the fact that Drogo was not willing to give up his marriage even before he came to believe in her.  I also enjoyed the antics of both families - that part got really cute.  I didn't like the fact that the mystery of Adonis was not cleared up, although I do realize that he will probably have a book of his own.	2003-05-15

Our herione spent just about as much time in the present as in the past.  It also was unusual to have a herione that felt that much for more than one guy.  (you'll have to read it though to see which one she ends up with!)  The story line was definitely unusual, and therefore, I enjoyed it for that reason.  Also, this is one of those books where you can really see the herione &quot;grow&quot;.  She started out a little dippy (&amp; blind!) but she really did grow up &amp; I enjoyed that.	2003-05-15

Yes, I knew that Harlequin had moved into this century - I just had NO idea how far they had moved! lol  Now for the book:<BR>All joking aside, this is an excellent love story.  I laughed, chuckled, grinned, (&amp; yes, turned red), &amp; just darn near cried towards the end.  I really had fun reading this &amp; totally fell in love with both Joshua &amp; Jessie.  I read the whole thing in a 5 hr sitting; couldn't bear to put it down to finish tomorrow.  Cherry Adair doesn't just know how to write hot scenes - she knows how to write a love story.  I will have to look around for more books by this author.  This will definitely be on my keepers-shelf.	2003-05-15

The hero, Ethan, was definitely hero material &amp; the heroine, Zoe, was smart, cute, &amp; an admirable person. It was constantly moving &amp; changing &amp; it had a number of enjoyable secondary characters.   Just when I thought the main problems were solved &amp; couldn't figure out what was left except the romance, another new twist would pop up &amp; it would take off again.  I'd recommend it to all JAK fans.	2003-05-15

I'd guess you'd call it 'action-romance'.  Ha!  I enjoy a second plot going on at the same time the romance is happening &amp; lots of action.  This one had it.  Unfornately, a couple of things about this one were a little too unbelievable, but I was still able to enjoy it.  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure-romance.  Surely, CA is going to cover Marnie's (our heroine) brothers stories next - or maybe she already has since this was written in 2000.  I'll definitely be picking them up.	2003-05-15

It had my spine tingling in a couple of spots &amp; I loved the romance between the lead characters.  The dialogue was just too fun; I smiled through out most of the book.  The secondary characters added a lot to the story &amp; there were a couple of romances on the side.  The plot moved along pretty good &amp; had a really interesting development, although I will have to admit it was not wrapped up real well.  It was kind of rushed &amp; I didn't understand the reasoning behind the villian's decisions at the end.  That aside, I was reminded of the reason I love JAK's writing.  If you like JAK, I think you'll definitely like this one.	2003-05-15

It was an ok read.  Spectors personality & coflict of interest with Colby was fun through out the book. <BR>The situations with teenagers I could totally relate to (having 3 raised & 1 to go!).  Colby really screwed up in Ch 10 & I think Diana should have held out a little longer to get his attention to his very one-sided attitude.  For being the \\"amazon business woman\\" that she was suppose to be, she sure let up on the fact that he was still blaming her for something she didn't set up.<BR>The father-son chat at the wedding was really a crack-up!  Brandon definitely got some points in there! I loved that.<BR>However, the book goes over & over & over the same problems - mainly about Diana's personality hang ups.  The book was overly long due to this.  I found myself skimming thru a lot of it about 2/3 of the way through, wishing they would just get on with it.  The story itself was pretty ok, it was just too drawn out.	2003-05-15

This was a really good story.  I loved watching our heroine, Daisy.  She was kind of goofy & shallow.... at least, that's the persona she put off at first.  Although she kept her big heart & forgiving nature (a little toooo forgiving if you ask me!), she definitely learned that she was capable of alot more in life than anyone had previously taught her.  I loved watching her find her feet.<BR>On the other hand, I couldn't STAND the secondary characters in this book!  It took me 200 pages to like the hero, Alex, even a little bit!  In the end, all of them showed a little bit of development of human compassion, but it took them forrrrevvvvver!  I don't know that I've ever read about a whole pack of people that are this self-centered, judgmental, & cruel!<BR>Now...... like I said, this was a really good story!  lol  lol  One thing that I can definitely say for SEP - she knows how to invoke feelings of all sorts.  She's truly a good writer.	2003-05-14

Although Sara was a bit tooooo naive I could definitely forgive her cause she was so good to Derek & he really deserved someone like her to take care of him (would have applied for the job myself if I'd known it was open! lol  lol)  It kept moving which allowed me to stay interested; thankfully it did not have too much of that \\"he thought about her (for 5 paragraphs) - she thought about him (for 5 paragraphs)\\"...... You know what I mean?  When half the book is just about 2 people thinking about each other??

After the first couple of chapters I skimmed thru twice as much as I read.  The heroine was suppose to be young &amp; naive; what I got was an airheaded nit-wit... an annoying one at that!  I can't even imagine a man putting up with her nonsensical rambling, much less falling in love with her.  The hero was probably suppose to be the brooding type - it went a little over-board to me.... hardly no personality.<BR>Well, I have heard good things about MJ, so I'm going to give one of her more recent books a try.	2003-05-14

This one was a disappointment; Unfortunately, I didn't like the hero (????) at all until the end of the book.  Although I could understand his anger, there was no excuse for him wanting to get vengence on innoccent people.  I kept reading hoping that he'd redeem himself &amp; it would get better.  I made it through 173 pages, then he gave the heroine (who may be very loyal to her family, but shows an extreme lack of intelligence) a very cruel ultimatum &amp; that almost made me lay the book down.... fact is the hero was an jerk, plain &amp; simple.... at that point I could really have cared less if he redeemed himself or not.  I guess in the end he did redeem himself, but he just wasn't hero material in my opinion.	2003-05-14

She doesn't mind getting outside the norm for typical Regency era acceptability, I'll say that.  So far, I have liked her heros &amp; heroines even though they (like most others) can make some really bad decisions.  I really liked reading about people who didn't think that they're entire life was based on their reputation within the ton &amp; that a title is more important than anything else in their life.<BR>It's not an overly exciting novel, not super funny, nor adventurous, but it did keep me interested &amp; I just love it when I can admire both a hero &amp; a heroine.  I'll be trying an another of CM's books.	2003-05-14

I really hate to put this review on here with all the other wonderful reviews about it! lol;  however, I guess people do need to hear from those of us that have differing opinions. I really thought I'd like it after reading IJ's 'A Magnificent Rogue' - but I was wrong.  It was very slow reading &amp; I was having a hard time staying in it then the heroine started acting extremely stupid &amp; the hero turned into an a real jerk.  I suppose I would have to say that due to his raising, he might have actually come a long way in life, but I still couldn't enjoy either the hero or the heroine.  So... I can't say I'd recommend this one.	2003-05-14

Wow, this is not at all what I expected when I picked up this book.  In fact, it was much better.  I was looking for a new historical romance author & since LK seemed to have such a large audience I thought I'd give her a try.<BR>When I read the back of this book I was afraid that it would be one of those where the heroine was a real jerk to the hero due to her deep-seated resentments (when not jumping into bed with him of course!)... not so, not so.  It's sooooo hard to give my opinion of this book without giving away too much info.  Very unexpected things happen that aren't reveiled until later in the book - so I have to be careful.<BR>I can say though that this really turned out to be a wonderful love story.  It had me sighing repeatedly... (as well as blushing frequently!!! lol)  Then about 3/4 of the way thru the book, Sophia did something so incredibly stupid I really wanted to throw the poor little book against the wall!  (yes, I get a little passionate during a well written book!)  Anyway, everyone lived thru it including me... :)  & our hero fixed everything in the end.  Unforturnately, I will have to say that the very end of the book was a little hard to swallow...  All in all though, it was definitely a worthwhile read - I don't find too many books that have this sweet of a love story - & I just adore a well-written love story.<BR>A little warning though - if you blush easily DO NOT read it in public! lol	2003-05-14

This book finds a dad for a baby & for a teenager with a bleak past & even bleaker future; it finds a family for a man that thinks he wants to live alone; & it finds a warm, loving, fun family for a woman that has only known a cold, politically correct family (& life in general).  The first couple of chapters I just thought it sounded really sad & serious; the rest of the first half I laughed over & over; then it went from heart-wrenching, to heart-melting, back to heart-wrenching (with laughs thrown in thoughout it at the oddest moments).  I started it one afternoon, had to quit for a few hours, then read til my eyes hurt, & got back up the next morning & just HAD to know how it all worked out!  (Bad, bad girl Jojo! lol)<BR>SEP has done an excellent job of making feelings just jump off the pages.  There are a multitude of characters that added so many special parts to the story.  I can't recommend it enough to those that enjoy a warm, funny, heart-wrenching, courageous romance with a really sexy hero & a strong, intelligent heroine, & great sense of family.  This is the reason I love SEP's writing.	2003-05-14

I was actually able to stay focused.... which has been impossible for me lately. Basically, this was a good vs. evil story & a good (sometimes very HOT) romance to go with it. It involved a psychic that could touch things & see visions (not giving anything away) & had a continually unfolding side story that took place 600 yrs ago. This book kept moving (well, mostly... it did drag just a tad a couple of times - but that didn't last long) & the characters were very likable; even though there was some problems to work through, they weren't absolute jerks about it. It had some good suspense in it that, although not chilling, at least made me hold my breath a couple of times. I also enjoyed the descriptions of Scotland... sometimes authors either can't make me get a good picture in my mind, or they go completely overboard & bore me to tears.... not so with this one. It even had it's own Scottish guardian ghost (complete with cat!) & a couple of fun Scottish legends. I'd recommend it to most all romance readers. I've been reading up & there are a series of these called the Draycott Abbey series. I'll definitely being trying out another one!	2003-05-14

She writes the sweetest love stories I've ever read.  Her hero's are magnificent examples of the male of our species.... never perfect, sometimes a dark background, not always nobility......but always enough to drool over & Oh my gosh the CHARM these men are capable of!  Her heroine's are colorful, independent, strong (but not rigid), & so loving..... I've never met one that acted like a spoiled brat.  This book was no exception.  However, do take note that this book comes after 'Lady Sophia's Lover' & although it could stand on it's own, I'm glad I read them in order; the 1st one has good background info.  And, as usual with LK's books, if you blush when reading DON'T read this in public!  lol  lol  Oh my gosh the love scenes!

Ok, I had totally forgotten that I had previously said that I was going to be more careful about reading JB's medieval romances!  Opps!  I did it again!  This one is really hard for me to give a review on.  On one hand, this is not at all my usual type of read (in fact, I usually RUN from this type!); On the other hand, I have to admit that JB has just done an excellent job on this story!  I started out only having a grudging respect (& no liking) for the heroine.... by the end of the book, I couldn't have admired her more.  The hero was to die for thoughout the entire story.<BR>However, as I have found in the past, JB gives a terribly historically correct accounting of the lives the people led in the Middle Ages.... YUCK!  However...... after just a few chapters, I knew that I didn't like this type of writing.... AND I knew that I was going to HAVE TO finish the story!  (yes, I'm often confused! lol)  So, as far as a recommend:  For those of you that can't handle brutality - DON't read it; However, if you like a historically correct medieval romance, & those realities don't bother you, then this would most probably be an excellent read.....

I see that it got pretty good reviews here on Amazon, so maybe it's just me.  It did have a few humorous scenes & the ending wasn't bad.  But - to me the heroine, Clio, was an immature BRAT!!  She sulked, she pulled stupid tricks,  & did not in any manner act like a woman of the 13th century.  Things she did that were supposed to be a result of pride really should have just embarrased her.  More than one of her stunts really put her life (& the life of others) in danger; Considering the time period they lived in, it just showed a real lack of intelligence.  I guess I just need a more intelligent heroine in my reading... Naive is ok, pulling funny stunts is fun, but showing a complete lack of intelligence just doesn't make me admire them.<BR>The hero, Merrick, was really a hard man at first - not unjust or cruel, just very hard.  However, set as it was in the 13th century, with the life he had led, it was justified.... or if not justified, at least more realistic.  He came around or grew a lot faster than Clio did.<BR>I suppose I've just gotten use to authors who either write a much more in-depth plot, a more in-depth love story, or at least has a spunky heroine that I can have fun reading about AND have a little respect for...	2003-05-14

It has a pretty good political history lesson &amp; really gives a lot of info on the difference on American &amp; Creole customs in the early 1800's.  As usual, LK wrote a very original storyline &amp; a really good love story.  The hero &amp; heroine did not hate each other &amp; fight all the way through the book - but showed each other kindness &amp; respect even though they had things to work through.  I loved watching them grow together.

It was an original storyline, but the way the romance came together was not all that entertaining to me.  First it drug-out, then it became predictable, then the end had a scene which was totally dramatic & unbelievable (I can do unbelievable in a fantasy type book, but not this type).  More than one of the secondary characters were totally irritating & I just wanted to slap a couple of them sometimes... it did not endear them to me at all.

In fact, I got a real bad attitude towards the lead male character, Eben, concerning his tendency to tell the kids he didn't want them.... and I never got over it! lol Eben was a little bit over the edge in his bitterness.  I think if it hadn't been for that, if Eben could have just attempted to not let those kids see his bitterness, I could have enjoyed the other characters in the story.  Anyway, the whole story was about Eben becoming human again, which he did eventually but not before he really tore up that little boy.  It just broke my heart... I guess I'm too much of a mom to put up with someone like him; in my book, it's never the kids fault... they shouldn't have to pay for adults mistakes &amp; they should be loved &amp; protected regardless of the circumstances.  I had a really bad attitude through out most of the book!  lol	2003-05-14

It was a pretty cute one, there was some pretty humorous parts - which I always enjoy.  It won't be on my keepers shelf though.  The little obsession of the two main characters (trying to out do each other) kind of got on my nerves after a while.  The way it all wrapped up wasn't real believable either.  During the last half I thought we had a real mystery going on that could have been interesting, but it fell really flat & disappointed me.  I have read another of LH's books though that I enjoyed, so I'll probably give her another try.	2003-05-14

This was so unlike anything I've read by Christine Dodd.  It didn't even sound like the same author I have read before.  I'll have to say though that I like it better than any of her others; it had a much better plot.  The love story was both fun &amp; heart-wrenching at the end.  Both the hero &amp; heroine are just wonderful.  Well, our hero could be called just a little domineering - in fact, I think our heroine might have been justified in knocking him in the head with something heavy a time or two!  lol  However, CD did a terrific job of making me fall head-over-heels for him anyway... lol  I really enjoyed this one.	2003-05-14

The story line was definitely original, I enjoyed the heroine, the hero &amp; the secondary characters, &amp; I liked the way LC wrapped it all up.  Parts were kind of dark but most of it was really fun.  There was just a tad too much of 'he thought, she thought' deal, but not enough to ruin the book.  I'll be trying another of LC's books.	2003-05-14

At first I thought it was going to be really creepy... as it turned out, it was only creepy in a couple of spots.  The romance was the main focus of the book &amp; it was ok, but it dragged out a little too much &amp; the 2 main characters had a real habit of doing things that I considered really dishonest... can't say that I'd want the 'hero' in my life acting like Jonathan did (the heroine, Devon, didn't act ANY better).  It may have just been my attitude while reading the book, but I couldn't seem to connect with the characters... never got a deep feeling for them.  KM has some pretty good storylines - but feelings never seem to 'jump off the page' for me.	2003-05-14

This is the 2nd book in JB's 'Malloren Series'; its my 3rd since I've read them out of order.  It would really be best to read 'My Lady Notorious' first due to a lot of references in this book to things that happened in the first one.  Now, all of that being said, I was really disappointed in this book.  I just loved 'My Lady Notorious' &amp; 'Secrets of the Night'.... they had both heros &amp; heroines that I could really enjoy.  Even though I didn't start out liking Chasity Ware from the first one, her personality was totally explained, understandable, &amp; made me come to really respect her.  Not so with Portia in this book.<BR>I can't, for the life of me, figure out why Bryght fell in love with her.  She was rude, unappreciative &amp; very insulting through the entire book - right down to the page when she admitted she loved him &amp; couldn't live without him (at the very end).<BR>Although it was attempted to explain why she acted like she did, I didn't go for it.  Without telling the story, she made sacrifices for a brother that was worthless &amp; blamed Bryght - however, it was only thru his actions that her life wasn't REALLY horrible!<BR>I like a book that at least has some affection and/or fun between the hero &amp; heroine - that at least have a reason for falling in love.  Although Bryght was an excellent hero, Portia ruined this one for me.  Bryght's the reason this one got the 3rd star! lol	2003-05-14

By halfway through it I was head-over-heels in love with Simon (truly a hero!) &amp; totally dreading what was to come for him.  This is a story about a 20 yr old crime against man, about love &amp; forgiveness.  Even though I knew it would turn out ok, I still hated what Simon was going to have to live through.  Ms. Needham does know how to write a good story &amp; stir up your emotions. I liked the fact that although Simon was keeping a HUGE secret from Kailey (which I usually don't like), LN had a truly acceptable reason for it (in this case it really was to protect Kailey &amp; her future).  I'll have to admit though that it's not a writing style that I'd want to read often;  although LN wrapped it all up very nicely, I was still so sad when I was finished with it.  However, I'm sure that many others would really like it cause I know that others don't always go for the light-hearted, humous kind of books that I usually want.	2003-05-14

Hmmm... well, I think I have myself built up so much for Rothgar's story that I expected way too much.  If you've read the first books of this series, you probably know what I mean... I REALLY had myself built up for this story!  Rothgar himself was a prime example of the male of our species.... the story let me down.  It was a pretty romance - but the romance could have been done in half the pages.  There was way too much 'he thought about her..... she thought about him....'  - it got really old.  It moved at a snails pace due to this fact.  The plots in the other books had more depth and moved much faster.	2003-05-14

This is another example of the difference in my taste for romance & that of a large number of others.  JB, as usual, wrote a wonderful story rich in history.  I realise that thousands of people would really love this story.  Alas, it's not my kind of love story.<BR>The story was set in 1068 during the invasion of England by William ...of Normandy.  It is a romance but the story is full of war, betrayal, & the horrible realistic everyday life of the people that lived during that time.  I don't care to read about that much realism... I'm one of those that want to escape from those type of horrible realities - not into them.  Reading about mutilation & inhumane punishments are just not my cup of tea.  Unfortunately, I picked this up after reading her Malloren series & was unpleasantly surprised.<BR>Another thing that wasn't to my taste was the often told story of mistrust between the hero & heroine.  They met, fell in love (& lust of course) - the great misunderstandings took place & they alternated between lust & turning cold shoulders to each other - almost til the end of the story.  I got really disgusted with both of them - often!<BR>Anyway, JB is definitely a great author - however, I will have to be more careful of her books that I choose to read; I was sad & sickened by the reality of those times through-out almost all of this book.  But, I do want to stress that those of you that like a well written story rich in history (and can handle brutality) may very well love this story	2003-05-14

Even when my eyes hurt, I just had a couple of chapters to go & NO WAY was I quitting then!  It was fun, had an interesting plot, & such warm passion (I LOVE warm passion)... it was really good; definitely on my keepers shelf!<BR>Rosie & her cousin Diana were a hoot - their 'plans' were nuts & their friendship was soooo sweet.  Brand was as good-hearted a hero as I've ever read about, & the secondary characters added soooo much to the story.   This was a book from the Malloren Series, so Bey (Marquess of Rothgar, Brand's brother) figured into quite a bit.  I still can't wait to read his story!<BR>If you like historicals definitely go for this one.	2003-05-14

I just found it somewhat amusing.  There was a little suspense, but I figured out the killer halfway through the book.  The number of people dying off in it was a little extreme... and it was wrapped up so fast that I never got a real convincing reason for why they all had to die.  The romance was pretty sweet, but they fell in a little too fast to be real convincing considering the start they had.  Just kind of ho-hum.	2003-05-12

I didn't find the humor in this one that others have talked about.  I just don't find spoiled, selfish, cruel people humorous.  She runs out in the middle of her wedding - w/o so much as telling her family why (leaving them to worry about what happened to her for 4 days); marries a stranger 2 days later; supposedly falls in love with the stranger 2 days after that; then proceeds to treat this man she supposedly loves like [dirt] every time she opens her mouth, embarrasses & humiliates him in front of EVERYONE she possibly can in his own home town!  I didn't see a reason for him to fall in love with someone like that.<BR>Written in a different style, the story itself could have been entertaining & interesting.

I do have mixed feelings about it though.  It was a very sweet, if somewhat heart-wrenching romance - which I almost always love (as long as it's not totally depressing).  However, most of the secondary characters were real jerks; Tony & Deborah were the only ones I could really enjoy & admire.  I had to raise my eyebrows a bit about how quickly the very moral, very responsible Deborah allowed herself to fall into bed with Tony - BUT given what her life had been for 27 yrs AND what the rest of it may turn out to be, I didn't fault her!  lol  (A girl HAS to have a little fun in life! lol)<BR>The storyline did keep moving & didn't allow me to grow bored with them \\"looking into each others eyes & thinking this & that\\", which I never enjoy.  However, I was more than a bit disappointed that while Tony fully expected Deborah to understand that he had to act with honor, he didn't think that she had to. That really bothered me.  But, in the end, he did accept her decision gracefully & support her in it.  All in all, it was a very enjoyable, satifying love story.  CM did an excellent job of making me actually feel the love between the two.  I will be trying another CM book.	2003-03-11

I agree with a few others that it was time for a change in the Dark Series.  I really thought that CF did a great job of adding a new twist.  I don't dare mention that new twist due to the fact that it's not told in the description or on the cover - it doesn't show up for a little while in the book.  So you'll just have to read it to find out!  The fact that is was more of a suspense thriller instead of just an action packed plot did not take away from the enjoyment for me.  It still had enough action to keep my eyebrows raised but it also constantly kept me guessing about who was doing it (not simply another ancient vampire).  The added humor to this story was a refreshing relief also - that has always been a personal preference of mine. As usual Byron was enough to take my breath away &amp; I even thought more of him than some of the other Carpathian males because although he was still just as protective of Antonietta he was not as overly dominating and borish as some of the others.  (Although, honestly, how could a girl hold Mikhail's borishness against him!)  I also enjoyed Antonietta - she was a highly intelligent &amp; strong woman.  I'll have to admit though that I would probably NOT be as understanding about her family as she had been all those years!  lol  It did explain her compassion quite well towards the end though.  I liked the off and on contact that Byron had with other Carpathians through out the book - that always adds something to it for me.  That bond between them all is just so fasinating.   I personally thought that the story was nicely tied up at the end - it didn't feel rushed or left hanging.  All in all another excellent read by CF.	2003-03-11

It's 1 of 5 in her Malloren series &amp; it did not let me down... in fact, it was one of my favorites.  Well, to be honest the very, very end was a tad anti-climatic but not enough to ruin it for me.  I was absolutely delighted with Lady Elf - she was smart, delightfully fun, &amp; not afraid to go after what she wanted.  I did not start out thinking I would like Fort (mainly due to the other books in the series) but he turned out to be a good hero (even though he was a jerk occassionally!).  As always the whole Malloren family played a great role &amp; improved the whole story...... just LOVE those Malloren men!  lol  There were also a couple of other secondary characters that added a lot; some of the conversations between Lady Elf &amp; her friend Amanda were a hoot!  As usual, JB added some great pieces of history &amp; gave a very colorful description on the times.  Overall a really enjoyable read!	2003-02-24

I loved seeing Max's life turned topsy-turvy & the antics of the 3 younger sisters was just too fun!  I'll have to admit that with this many characters involved character development wasn't that great, but I also didn't have to go through the long process of not liking the characters before they started growing into decent human beings; so, all in all, that worked out okay for me.  I liked the fact that Max & Caroline tried to keep focused on taking care of the younger ones. Although this was not an action packed story, I did not find it boring like other reviewers.  The girls keeping Max on his toes was fun & entertaining to me.  I would recommend it to those that like a light, fun, & very sweet story.	2002-11-18

'He's male & he's gorgeous so he absolutely HAS to be a bad guy!  Let's don't even give him the chance to get to know him.  Let's just treat him like [dirt] just in case!'  Sorry, there's NOT much intelligence in that kind of thinking!  Although Adrianne was fun throughout most of the story - I didn't like her at all as the herione. I really enjoyed a whole lot of the book.  Some of the time-travel parts that KMM came up with was just too good; I laughed so hard.  Adam was definitely a bad guy that I could be totally disgusted with.  Because he was Fae he didn't believe he had to follow any rules of honor.  He claimed that he bested Hawk, but in fact he couldn't best him without magic - man to man he lost every time.  Hawk took my heart - he's definitely hero material. However, I just couldn't see why he was in love with Adrianne; yes, she was exceptionally beautiful - but she never showed him a personality that was loveable.  She more or less just slapped him in the face every time she got near him.<BR>So, you might try it yourself - it's had lots of good reviews;   I've just never been thrilled with the stories that have the main characters treating each other so shabby throughout the entire story right down to the final chapters.  I guess I'm just real disappointed cause I liked 'The Dark Highlander' so much.	2002-10-27

I really enjoyed the story of the Tuatha De Danaan (pronounced \\"tua day dhanna\\") & will probably do some research on the internet about it.

Actually, I also stopped & re-read a few other sections just because they were so blommin' funny!  It was really amazing the way KMM was able to tie in such a dark, involved plot with lots of humor & excellent romance & make it all work together.  It was definitely a book that I hated to see end.

NR has done it again!<BR>Reviewer: Jojo from Oklahoma<BR>Wow, I really needed this one after the heavy stuff I've been reading lately. I enjoyed 'Inner Harbor' immensely. It's a very well written, heart-warming family story. Well.... ok, maybe you wouldn't want your kids reading the sex scenes! ha! Those were pretty hot... (that wasn't the focus of the book though)! :) I had read the first 2 in this trilogy (Sea Swept & Rising Tides) quite some time ago; Not sure why I didn't finish up with this one. I remember really enjoying this whole family in those 2 books also but, if I remember correctly, this is the best of the series. This had a great story for Sybill (our leading lady). Watching her come to terms with her own past & self-defense mechanisms was just great; She surely wasn't perfect in some of her past decisions, but she did a lot of growing, admitted her own mistakes, & worked to correct them as best she could. I loved the way Phillip kind of just pushed her along in this relationship; It was fun & the relationship obviously wasn't going to happen any other way. I also love the secondary characters (as with most of NR's books); They add so much to the story.  I won't say this is exactly a light read - there are some real hard truths about real lives in it, but the focus of the book is not about that, it's about growing past it. Once again, NR could make me fall in love with the main characters & really want to spit at the bad ones! :) I do suggest, however, that these books be read in order, the story builds from one to the next. Happy Reading!	2002-09-23

HOWEVER, I'm not sure I'm going to finish it.  The leading lady (Bess) is just about too stupid for words.  Harsh language, I know... But I just can't believe IJ was trying to make Bess sound tough & independent (she's a better writer than this).  I mean really - Bess is going to go back to the wilds of Mexico,  BY HERSELF, (where she had BARELY escaped from with her life - with the help of the CIA), & save someone that is 'maybe' running around out there by theirself (or may be dead, she doesn't even know)!  That is just ONE of her stupid ideas.  She fights the leading male (Kaldak) EVERY step of the way & tells him exactly what she is going to do whether he likes it or not.  Kaldak would just be excellent except he just completely bows down to her even when it could get her & other people killed (one person already had to die because of Bess' stupid decisions).  Somehow I just think that if he is as bad & determined as he is suppose to be & thought she could really screw up an entire operation & maybe get hundreds of people killed, he would just tell her - No, that's stupid & it's NOT happening!  I don't know, maybe if Bess had a more realistic view of things & actually allowed Kaldak to help her PLAN something intelligent to get things accomplished, I might feel different.  I only gave this 2 stars instead of one because the storyline does keep moving & can be quite suspenseful - but that doesn't make up for the super annoying parts.	2002-09-21

Sometimes I had to just read right on thru stuff in order to not take too long trying to understand some of the computer talk!  lol  Somehow though, that did not detracted from the story. I'm usually not into SciFi at all, but I'm really glad I took another reader's suggestion &amp; tried this one.  It was definitely suspenseful &amp; fast paced.  Ms. Squires did a great job of keeping me guessing how things could possibly be resolved &amp; totally surprised me with the way several things rounded out.  She also described scenes in a manner that gave me great visuals.  (I'm not sure I could enjoy a movie made from it cause I already have every character's picture &amp; voice in my mind!)  I'll admit that a couple of scenes near the end of the book were a bit too descriptive for me, but I was able to skim over them, get the basis of what was going on, &amp; not let it ruin the story for me.  It had good secondary characters that really added to the story line, were necessary to the whole, &amp; helped bring everything to it's conclusion.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was the heroine, Vic; I never got a  convincing reason for her hostility towards her femininity, nor her self-destructive lifestyle.  It kind of turned me off towards her. I do understand that a person's past can shape their personality, I've seen situations where it's understandable - I just didn't understand Vic's reasons.  However, Ms. Squires did save me from being totally disgusted with Vic by not having her turn that hostility on Jodie; With him, at least, she was decent.  That part aside, this was really a great read.  I would definitely recommend it &amp; will be putting it on my keepers shelf.  Happy Reading!	2002-09-09

It is, however, one series that absolutely needs to be read in order.  NR does a wonderful job of describing so many facets of this book.  The island sounds absolutely gorgeous & a great place to raise a family.  Nr really pulls you into the atmosphere of the place (as usual).  The feelings she described concerning Nell's past with the abusive (sick!) husband was so very realistic (however, I would not read a book that only focused on that type of relationship).  I don't usually read about evil, but this book wasn't just completely about evil - it was just part of the story.  NR could really make it feel creepy sometimes. I enjoyed the fact the there were so many secondary characters that really added to the story.  Ripley & Lulu are a hoot - I always enjoy a little humor in a book.  NR was very clever at adding humor to an otherwise very serious storyline.  I've never read much about witches (never heard of Wiccan) but I did appreciate the values these lady's place on the Craft.  No harm, don't change destiny.  One reviewer mentioned that they were disappointed that there wasn't a bigger \\"bang\\" at the end of the book - I thought that also.  However, just keep reading the series - believe me this is one series where the next 2 books just keep getting better.  That \\"bang\\" is definitely coming!<BR>Book Two in the series (& the funniest):  'Heaven And Earth'<BR>Book Three in the series (& the most powerful):  'Face The Fire'	2002-08-24

It was a fun, light-hearted read (along with some really steamy scenes too).  There were a number of times that I couldn't stop chuckling for a few minutes.  The plot wasn't much, but it was cute.  Even the chapter titles were cute.  It was mainly steamy romance but involved the French Revolution & 'The Black Rose' - a mysterious hero who saved a number of aristocrats from death at that time...  Sometimes I get tired off plots that come off dark or where the main characters spend most of the book hating each other.  If you want real involved plots this is not your book. If you want light reading & fun, then this is it.	2002-07-22

I'm not sure if the book as a whole was as entertaining as a couple of the others in the Dark Series, but it definitely grabbed my attention.  When Raven & Mikhail started \\"talking\\" that first chapter it was sooooo neat.  Ok, maybe Mikhail was a \\"LITTLE\\" over-bearing, but that was just the Carpathian jealousy showing through......... I mean, you can't hold that against him can you?  :)   Early this week I was running around on the web (somewhere!) and found the first chapter of Dark Magic..... I sat here at this silly computer and read the whole first chapter again!  ha!  I couldn't help it!  It just grabbed me again.  So, I guess I'll have to go buy it now so I can read it again (the first time it was a library book).  Well, my biggest concern while reading all of the Dark Series was \\"Oh no!  Does this series really have to end?!\\"  I've recently read that there is a new book coming out to this series.  YEA...  If you haven't read these yet (and can deal with a bit of violence), do yourself a BIG favor....... read them!	2002-07-22

Our herione spent just about as much time in the present as in the past.  It also was unusual to have a herione that felt that much for more than one guy.  (you'll have to read it though to see which one she ends up with!)  The story line was definitely unusual, and therefore, I enjoyed it for that reason.  I can also say that the story definitely kept moving - it never got stale like a lot of stories do while the characters get to know each other.  Also, this is one of those books where you can really see the herione &quot;grow&quot;.  She started out a little dippy (&amp; blind!) but she really did grow up and take responsibility for herself, I enjoyed that. Yes, I think 'A Knight In Shining Armor' was better, but I was definitely not disappointed in 'Legend'.	2002-07-22

'Dark Magic' was one of my favorites. Seldom have I found books that so very acurately describe \\"sensual\\".  After reading about Gregori in a couple of the other books (I didn't read them in order) I was thinking that Gregori's story could possibly be too \\"dark\\" due to Gregori's nature....... I am very happy to report - Not So!  CF put in enough touches of humor concerning Gregori's protectiveness & the other men's reaction to same said protectiveness that it really kept me entertained.  This guy could be overly-protective of me anyday!!!!!!!!!  :)	2002-07-22

This was the first of the Dark Series that I found by accident.  Ohmygosh!!!!!!  I was hooked!  The first chapter or so kind of made me grimace;  Not knowing what the rest of the book was like, I wasn't certain I could continue.... I don't do violence very well.  LOL  Was I ever wrong!  This is the ultimate in sensuality.  I'm not much on domineering men, but I think I could adjust!  :)  It's hard to say which is my favorite in the series, but Dark Gold was definitely one of them.	2002-07-22
US	41609612	R1CMJB768YP63E	044023722X	299088859	A Painted House	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Unexpected	This was a hard book to rate for me.  John Grisham is an excellent writer as this book once again proves. Unfortunately, it's not my type.  I'll no longer be able to just pick up every JG book &amp; be sure I'll enjoy it.  I started this book knowing it was a new venture for JG but still expecting the suspense and fast pace of his previous works.  Needless to say, I was a little shocked at what I found.  Yes, he did a wonderful job of describing life in that time &amp; place, but it was extremely slow to me.  It's not the type of book I look for &amp; enjoy at all.  I kept waiting for the story line to pick up &amp; it never did.  I will have to say I was disappointed.  I can certainly understand a lot of the 5 stars this book received, because if this is the type of story a person enjoys well they couldn't have found much better.  Unfortunately, it's not my type &amp; not at all what I expected.  I'll no longer be able to just pick up every JG book &amp; expect to enjoy it; I'll have to check it out first.	2002-07-07

I've never been much on futuristic romance, but this one really kept me entertained.  Only once in a while do I find a 'hero' that makes me drool like Lorgin did :)  (although I expect Regar to be right up there with Lorgin!) I wanted to give it 5 stars, but I did have a bit of a problem with Deana.  More than once I really wanted to tell her \\"Knock him in the head & make him listen to you!!!!\\"  She really did give in much, much too easily on a few things that she should have put her foot down & at least made him explain things or compromise.  I did not find the humor 'laugh out loud' like a lot of people (well, EXCEPT the morning after the Transference!  Know THAT was laugh out loud funny!), but I did smile & chuckle quite a bit thru out.  I will definitely being reading Rejar's story.  Thanks, Ms. Joy, for a very entertaining read.	2002-07-07
US	41609612	R36GAV4AUU7CWL	0312979975	283452346	Fantasy Lover	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Wow!  I want one!	Wow!  I want one! (A Julian that is)  I won't repeat the story line since it has been detailed enough;  But I will repeat: Wow!  What a guy..... I agree with another reviewer that even though he has a tortured past he doesn't whine about it.  He does share it with Grace but not in a whining manner.  I also like how he's not shy about coming to her defense.  I love the tough guys that don't mind showing their muscle at the appropriate time but don't have to prove themselves constantly and don't have to prove their manhood by being jerks to the females in their life.  Grace is also a delight (but I don't need one of her, thank you LOL ).  She is just too funny trying to deal with the situation.  Yes, I realize there were some not too realistic qualities concerning her career, but no one is perfect, & I'd definitely be a little sidetracked if I had my own Julian waiting somewhere for me!  Selena was a hoot too..... her opening remark to Grace on page one had me chuckling immediately & set the stage for the book for me.  I enjoyed greek mythology in school & this book has me wanting to do a little research on the relationships between the various gods.  This book will definitely stay on my small, but growing keepers shelf.  I can't wait to read the Dark Hunters series.  I hope they have heroines as fun as Grace & heroes as sexy & masculine as Julian.  This is my first SK book, but I will definitely be checking out others.  Thanks to everyone who takes the time to write reviews & helps me find new enjoyable authors!	2002-07-01
