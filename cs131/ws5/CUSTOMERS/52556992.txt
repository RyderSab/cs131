Touching and tender, and beautifully designed, what a dedicated display of youth this book is.  It is a world of good-looking, sensual, yet innocent young men that Adam Raphael seems to capture in all of his photography.  Where does he find all of these hot looking young guys?  I am really impressed.  It is a tribute to these young men that he immortalized them at the peak of their beauty and fleeting youth, a time that will not last forever.  Ask any former model for the proof.  It is also to these young guys's credit that they worked with a talented professional photographer like Adam Raphael to frame their beauty forever. <br /> <br /> <br />Following Adam's first book, \\"Friends\\", this is a welcome addition and new collection that includes more \\"Friends\\" and now \\"Brothers too.\\"  The sepia toned, color, and black and white images are printed on sepia colored backgrounds and are beautifully photographed displaying these handsome young men wrestling, playing ball, enjoying a day the beach, and just having a good time.  Adam has accomplished what he set out to do (be sure to read his foreword) capturing the innocence and beauty of these masculine & handsome young men at the peak of their athletic ability.  What is intriguing about these photos is the playfulness of these young guys, who are naturally photogenic as they peel off their shirts to expose all the hard work they done in staying in shape, and improving their bodies. <br />   <br /> <br />Adam is a gifted photographer and each book he publishes seems to get better and bigger.  This book belongs in every serious collector's library, and in the hands of everyone who appreciates excellent photography and youthful beauty.  A stunning achievement! <br /> <br />	2004-12-02

As a long time fan and admirer of Joseph Itiel's writing, I always find his books fascinating, exciting, informative, and hard to put down.  Whether you read his books as a form of fantasy, or as a person who has had experience with escorts, you will find his stories are never disappointing.  Itiel's many years of first-hand knowledge and experience, reveal a world few of us ever experience or know little about.  The seven stories in his latest book reveal the private thoughts and feelings of male escorts, giving us a different point of view, that of the escorts.  All of these stories are sexy & erotic, and truly educational.  We are all familiar with the client's point of view, their needs, desires, and dislikes, but now we finally get a eye-opening view of what it's like to be on the other side.  I think this is the best book Joseph Itiel has written so far. <BR> <br />In these seven stories we are taken to many different countries, from the Philippines, to Acapulco, to Hong Kong.  We get to explore the personal backgrounds, feelings, and thoughts of many escorts of various nationalities.  We meet Nestor in \\"The Luneta Park Call Boy\\", who meets an Australian gay couple who want him to leave his native Philippines to live with them.  Is it worth it, or to his advantage, knowing what is required of him by this couple?  In \\"The Tribe\\" we get to know Ronnie Lou, a black street hustler, and discover his many multiple personalities.  And in the title story, \\"The Trophy Boy\\", Domingo leaves Acapulco for San Francisco, with a gringo named Jim, and becomes his trophy boy.  What an experience is in store for him!  Not to be missed.<br />All of these stories are sexy, bold, and very erotically charged, but what is more important is the openness the escorts exhibit in telling us about their reactions to their clients desires, their personal feelings, and how they respond to these positive or negative emotions.  Itiel is one of the best writers of this genre today.  I wish there had been more stories in this collection, for it all ended too soon for me.  Highly Recommended!!!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-10-23

Either way, it's very entertaining and for lack of a better term, a real page-turner.  The late author, Earle Ernst, was an Army officer in his early thirties who was stationed in Japan after World War II.  The author clearly loved all things Japanese and his description of the Japanese people, their manners, architecture, seaside villages, and history of that time are presented vividly to us in loving detail.  Later in his life the author made a career out of his love for the Japanese culture by becoming a specialist in Kabuki theatre at the University of Hawaii. <BR> <br />Ernst portrays Japan as a country that accepted sex as just another desire to be satisfied.  His story contains many characters that include; the American Army men, their wives, and the Japanese help they employed.  However, the most interesting part of the story is Ernst's portrayal of the American men, who having always repressed their gay sexuality, found they were now allowed in this liberated country to finally be themselves, form same-sex relationships, and enjoy a sense of community.  Was it because Japan was really that liberated, or was it perhaps a result of the war, where cities were reduced to rubble, food was scarce, and a carton of cigarettes could get you almost anything?  Questions like these do present themselves in the readers mind while reading this novel.<br />The author explains that Monju is the Japanese god for men who love other men.  This book is a history lesson that is enlightening, informative, and quite humorous at times.  I enjoyed this honest and candid novel from a man who truly did love all things Japanese.<BR>  <br />Joe Hanssen	2003-05-18

In his debut collection of nine stories, Adam Haslett takes us into the hearts, minds, and souls of his characters in an effort to show us the pain of his characters, in the hope that we will actually feel it and show our sympathy toward them.  I believe he has accomplished his goal.  These are characters that are at the crossroads of their lives.<BR>  <br />In \\"The Storyteller\\", a despairing man gains comfort by making up stories to help a dying boy.  In \\"The Volunteer\\", we meet Elizabeth, an elderly woman who has spent the better half of her life in the Plymouth Brewster Structured Living Facility.  She lives for her weekly visits from Ted, a young high school boy, and is devastated when her new doctor forbids his visits.  These are people struggling with inner despair and deep loneliness.  And in \\"Reunion\\", a young man who is compelled to make arrangements for his own impending death writes inspiring letters to the father with whom he will soon be reunited.<br />These are painful stories that could have chased many a reader away.  However, Haslett's exceptionally beautiful command of the language and his emotionally intense portraits of his characters, only prove to be helpful in giving us the courage to face our own pain, life decisions, and unexpected changes.  It's that kind of collection that makes you hope this talented writer has more stories to send our way in the near future.  This is a powerful debut!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-05-16

Byler's novel told in 11 chapters of varying lengths covers a series of moments in the life of character Wilson Hues.  The shortest chapters are like snapshots of his childhood eclipsed by abuse from his father.  The longer chapters center on Hues' adult life, as he goes from job to job, different homes, and shaky relationships.  It's amazing how the author combines humor with the tragic element of these stories.  These significant moments in the life of Wilson all added up to a vivid and complete pattern that all comes together quite nicely by the end of this story.<br />In one chapter called \\"Roaches\\", we learn of Wilson's futile attempts to rid his NYC apartment of these hated pests while at the same time that he is trying to save his marriage to a wife who is becoming more and more dissatisfied with him.  His description of the roaches, crawling on the kitchen floor in such great numbers that the floor itself appears to be moving, is unnerving.  His wife's growing frustration with him and Wilson's inability to cope with it all is heartbreaking and moving.  The author gives us a warmhearted and sympathetic hero that anyone with a heart would feel sorry for and want to help.  <br />This sad, but funny, personal account of one man's life is fresh and original, written by a young new author who shows great promise.  A strong debut that will engage all who read it.  I look forward to his future endeavors. <BR> <br />Joe Hanssen	2003-05-13

Thomas Waugh has collected and published here for the first time some of the most explicit homoerotic drawings from the period before the Stonewall riot in 1969.  There are about 200 previously unpublished gay male sexual graphics in this book that are from the author's extensive collection.  The amount of work and effort Waugh has taken to bring this collection to print is inspiring and a credit to this author's dedication to recording this rich history.  Tom of Finland, Blade, Etienne, Steve Masters and Graewolf are some of the more well-known artists represented, along with many other unknown artists.  Ein Liebhaber is a favorite of mine, whose drawings of orgies of ancient youths in Corinthian helmets is fascinating.  There's no denying these images were meant to create lust.  They may seem a little tame by today's standards, but can still create a highly erotic desire when viewed.<BR>  <br />Waugh's essays of introduction are well-researched and fascinating reading for anyone desiring a detailed and academic history of erotic drawings and what it all means culturally.  For those of us who prefer to just peruse the drawings, each drawing is explained at the bottom of the page.  The author's biographies of the artists are a definite plus and appreciated.  It's nice that we get to know the artists, which often is sadly missing in other books of this genre.  This is a must for any collector of gay male erotic art.  It is a book that will entertain, arouse, and teach all at the same time.  Highly recommended!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-05-09

It is not very often that you discover a fascinating and exciting book by accident, totally unaware it even existed, and it enters your life like a cool breeze after a hot and humid summer day.  You're thrilled, you're excited, and you find you can't tear yourself away from it until you're finished.  This is the situation I found myself in right from page 1.  Novelist Neihart has given us an entertaining story based on real events and people, but has taken liberty with some of the scenes and action in recreating these historical events for us.<BR>  <br />It's the real life story of A'Lelia Walker, the daughter of Madame C.J. Walker who became a multimillionaire by selling personal-care products to African American women.  The story is based on the life of A'Lelia, how she used her inheritance after her mother died, and the flamboyant characters she surrounded herself with.  She threw elaborate, celebrity-filled parties in her Westchester mansion and 136th Street apartment.  The story centers on the 1930 lavish drag ball, where female impersonators and the underground gay culture existed in all its splendor and sexuality.  We are introduced to such figures as; Langston Hughes, the poetic genius, Nancy Cunard, the shipping heiress, Richard Nugent, Harold Jackman, and the most tragic figure of the drag ball, sexual addict Jennie June.  There is more revealed about this fascinating character than any other in this story, including A'Lelia's.  That Jennie June is a major part of the story is fitting as she is the most compelling and interesting of all the people portrayed.<br />Neihart has created a magnificent view of the Harlem Renaissance and written it in a way that is entertaining, light, and easy to read.  It was a rough & sometimes tragic time to being living, but as this story shows it was also an exciting time of parties, fun, and lavish entertainment.  Never dull, never boring, it's a piece of history that will enlighten and educate you. <BR> <br />Joe Hanssen	2003-05-08

Will Self's update of Oscar Wilde's \\"Dorian Gray\\" seems to be hardly worth the effort as he seems to try and offend everyone by bringing it into the age of AIDS.  To his credit, he faced an overwhelming task in updating this story and managed to handle it.  It was not that difficult, for the plot was already there, he just needed to make a few twists in the story to place his name on it.  Is it worth reading?  You'll have to be the judge.  Personally I wanted to stop reading after the first 100 pages, but in all fairness to the author, and hoping to better understand his take on this story, I struggled through to the end.  Later I wondered why I bothered.  The writing is laced with endless metaphors and similes, and I believe it's Self's stylish well-mannered wordplay that can turn the reader off and want to head straight to the dentist for a root canal, which is less painful.<BR>  <br />In this story, Dorian is a young gay man in 1981 London who meets older gentlemen that include Henry Wotton and the artist Basil Hallward.  Hallward produces a nine channel video of gorgeous Dorian, who he has fallen in love with, and captures the youthful beauty of Dorian forever, so he thinks.  Dorian ends up aging only on tape, while in real life he stays handsome and young, but shows a mean streak as he goes around infecting everyone he meets with HIV.  It all sounds too familiar, like \\"Patient Zero\\" from Randy Shilts book, \\"And the Band Played On\\".  The books final pages contain a real surprise ending, but this didn't change my view of the book.  It does seem like no one in this book escapes from Self's dislike of homosexuality, including most gay artists, and his blaming the plague on the sexual habits of gay men.  This sounds familiar too, but we usually hear it only from the right side of the fence.<br />There are a lot of problems with this story.  The characters are boring, drug-induced, self-hating individuals who seem to have no redeeming qualities.  Who could possibly want to know people like this?  Dorian is supposed to be an overwhelming beauty that all these men are infatuated with, but instead Self gives us a Dorian who lacks any beauty, charm, emotion, or attractiveness.  It's all totally boring!  I had great hopes that this would be an exciting, emotional re-telling of a great piece of fiction that might compare a little to the original by Oscar Wilde, but that didn't happen.  I could go on, but enough has been said.  What a disappointment!  Dorian should have never been transported to the 80's, that's for sure!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-05-06

Let's face it; usually the reality of our everyday lives is not the fantasy or dream reality of who we really want to be.  We hope for the best in life, and sometimes we get it, but most of the time we are disappointed.  Pousson is a talented new southern novelist who has painted for us in this story a portrait of conflicting family relations that is a result of a failure to communicate.  This is the American dream of a perfect family that is just that, a dream!<br />Pousson tells us the intense story of Nita and Louis, an unhappily married couple who have two children.  They are violently spinning out of control in their relationship because they lack the ability to effectively communicate with one another.  Nita's obsessive demands on and abuse of the children is heartbreaking.  The constant pressure she places on Louis by demanding he work harder so she can have the life she deserves is selfishly unyielding.  She is obsessive about having a better and richer life, while Louis is content with the life they are living.  Nita's priorities and perspective on life are very unrealistic for her situation.  Is it possible for them to save their marriage and give the children the love they deserve, or are they on an unavoidable downward spiral to a tragic end?<br />This is not a gay novel.  It's to the author's credit as a gay writer that he can write such a compelling and moving story about a heterosexual family in such a realistic fashion.  I think the author has the advantage as a gay man of portraying straight characters in a way that they possibly cannot.  The result is a story with intense and emotional characters that are unforgettable.  What an exciting debut novel, set in Louisiana's Cajun country and embedded in southern reality.  This is not to be missed!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-05-05

He states, \\"The negative aspect of beauty in our culture is our obsession with it - like when a person becomes bulimic or anorexic because they want to look like a celebrity or a model in a magazine.  He further states, \\"Beauty is fun, it has its place, but don't mistake it for self-worth\\".  In other words we need more than beauty and good looks to feel fulfilled.  We need to look inside ourselves and find inner beauty and true meaning in our lives.  Once in a while we should forget the \\"me\\" and lend a helping hand to others who need us.  Good advice. <BR> <br />You may not agree with all of the advice being dished out in these essays, but it is a fascinating look into the lives of these famous and not so famous individuals, and the way they think.  It will also make you think a little more deeply yourself, and provide you with plenty of interesting advice to digest and compare with your own beliefs.  Harmon has done an excellent job in bringing these people's thoughts into our own thoughts.  This is a book I certainly will read again!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-05-03

This is a beautiful book that proves dreams do come true if you really want something bad enough and are willing to work hard enough no matter what the risk to reach that goal.  It was Paris, 1968, when young 18-year-old street performer Philippe Petit saw a sketch of the proposed World Trade Center towers, and he was so awestruck that he drew a line between the two rooftops of the towers, and decided then and there that his ultimate goal was to one day walk on a high wire between the two towers.  Over the next six years he perfected his craft.  He did public performances atop Paris' Notre Dame in June, 1971, and he walked between the northern pylons of the world's largest steel arch bridge in Sydney harbor, as well as other high wire acts.  One day in late summer 1974, Petit's dream came true.  As thousands watched he made eights crossings between the towers, 110 stories above the ground, in less than an hour.<br />I think the most fascinating aspect about this story, was the lengths that Petit and his co-conspirators went to plan, train, and carry out this unauthorized feat.  It's all here in vivid detail.  And even if you didn't bother to read the text in this book, the photographs are amazing and breathtaking by themselves.  This is a captivating memoir that captures the excitement, triumph, and joy of Petit's stunning achievement.  Now that the towers are, sadly, gone, it's all the more important as a part of the towers history.  I more than enjoyed this memoir, I was fascinated by it.  It is certainly a positive and enlightening ray of hope for those who dream of the impossible! <BR> <br />Joe Hanssen	2003-05-01

This is a beautiful slip-cased edition of two larger-format books which is a delight for the lover of male beauty and creative art.  It is a luxurious but sort of obsessive study of a Nordic blond model posing against the elements of water and air.  Of course, the model is a work of perfection and adds to the beauty of these images.  Lagerfeld compares the different distortions of the body and the results from the body being submersed in water and air.  The human body has always been a major part of Karl Lagerfeld's photographic work, and his creative imagination makes this two book set another first in unique design.  Lagerfeld's published works are so different from other photographers that one can only wait patiently for his next creation.  A beautiful study of male nude photography that should not be missed by any fan or collector.  <br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-29

This novel begins with a moving prologue in which Ian describes the death of his lover, Trevor, Ian's life partner who has died of AIDS.  The devastating impact of Trevor's death leaves middle-aged Ian empty, no longer willing to love another, and totally devoted to his career as a repertory actor.  Will he ever be able to love again?  Well, several years pass, and Ian finds himself drawn to a beautiful young actor from Texas, named Jimmy, who's playing Ariel in the company's production of \\"The Tempest\\".  Jimmy falls for Ian as well, and slowly works his way inside the walls of Ian's heart.  But on a visit home to Texas, tragedy strikes, as Jimmy is the victim of a hate crime.  Ian once again finds himself the survivor after Jimmy's death.  Will he be able to rebuild his life again?  Or will this be too much for him to overcome?  Ian flies to Texas for the funeral and the second part of the novel begins revolving around the trial of Jimmy's killers.  Will justice be served?  And will Ian be able to show forgiveness?<BR>  <br />I think the strength of the novel is placed on the second part of the book.  The relationship Ian develops with Jimmy's grandmother is beautifully told, and the strength, love and friendship they discover in each other is truly heartwarming.  Taylor's taken on two hot topics of the last twenty years in gay politics, AIDS and hate crimes, and has done a remarkable job with them.  Yes, it's a take on the Matthew Shepard story, and no one is denying that, and this story could never compare to the tragedy of Matthew's death.  However, the more these tragic hate crime stories are told, in whatever form, credit should be given to whoever gets the message across of how wrong and hateful these senseless attacks are.  This is a well-written story about love, loss, and the desire of the human spirit to survive. <BR> <br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-29

Malloy makes an impressive debut with this high school senior's coming of age in 1978 Minneapolis.  While the plot may be familiar (it would make a good movie), it's Malloy's style of writing and attention to the tiniest details that make it different than other books on this subject. <BR> <br />Kevin Doyle has a pretty [messed] up life.  His mother died two years ago when her car crashed into the frozen Mississippi River and no one knows what really happened.  Was it an accident or maybe even a suicide?  Kevin's dad is now being constantly bombarded by the town's widows, and hates his job at the local auto plant.  Kevin is very confused, he's lonely, and angry at his father all the time.  One thing he has going for him is his good looks, and he could have any girl he wants in the school.  That's not what Kevin wants, as he has sets his sights on one of the hottest guys in school, named Jon, and secretly is in lust of him.  However, Jon is a beer drinking type of guy, who talks only about girls.  Will he get the guy of his dreams?  Malloy does a great job in playing with words, giving the reader both what Kevin wants to say and what he actually ends up saying in a lot of situations.  Kevin is sort of a wise guy, which leads to some very funny scenes, like when he calls his dad's girlfriend a cow and \\"moos\\" at her every time he sees her.  <br />Kevin's sarcasm masks his real character, a sensitive, and confused young man, who is longing for love, and at the same time afraid of being gay and expressing his real feelings.  \\"The Year of Ice\\" is a great debut novel by Brian Malloy, and one with characters, especially Kevin, that are very entertaining and a joy to read about.  Highly Recommended!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-29

Novels about making it in Hollywood are nothing new.  Hollywood has a reputation where everyone uses everyone to get what they want as fast as they can.  \\"Tricks of the Trade\\" is such a novel but there's a lot more plot here, and this book is a fast, easy read full of vivid characters who know a little about back stabbing and getting their own way.  There's Bart Cain, the main character, who is a publicity writer for Sterling Studios; Shari Draper, Bart's homophobic boss; Rod Dominguez, the hot Latino stud who hustles by night and writes so called brilliant scripts by day; and Jim Fallon, the All-American sit-com star whose career is in the dumps.  Bart meets Rod in a chat room, and the two get together for some action.  Soon Bart is instantly hooked on Rod, and after Rod talks Bart into getting his script read by the studio, he drops him like a ton of lead.  Into the picture steps, Jim Fallon, who thinks Rod's script is his answer to his sagging career.  This story, with more twists than you can imagine, leaves you exhausted by the end of the book, trying to keep up with it all.  The fun is in seeing just how far each of these characters will go to get ahead.  You will find yourself racing toward the finish line to see who comes out the winner in this fun, but busy novel.

I am often leery of memoirs published by University presses as they tend to be filled with stoic facts, are often boring, display little emotion, and reveal very little of the real person being showcased.  This book is certainly an exception in every way, as it reads like a novel, and is filled with fascinating, intimate details of Ricardo's life.  Ricardo J. Brown's memoir offers us an exciting look into gay life of the late 1940's.  Brown was discharged from the navy for being a homosexual, and returned to his working-class life in St. Paul, Minnesota.  Most of this memoir centers around a bar called Kirmser's that catered to working class men during the day, and at night became a hang-out or underground club for gay men.  It's Brown's own personal observations, feelings, and experiences he shares with us of the friends he made during these nightly visits to Kirmser's that are so enlightening, fascinating and fun to read.  Some of the stories are sad and tragic, too.  It's the honestly in the telling of these stories that will captivate you.  A few personal photos have been included in this memoir. <BR> <br />If you want a glimpse into what gay life was life in the time before Stonewall, then this book is an excellent choice.  It's a small book that's filled with the life of a time most of us know little about, but would like to know more about.  Gay life in the 1940's was quite different than today and certainly very closeted.  What will always remain the same whether it is 1945 or today is the love, emotions, and personal intimacy that people share and have in common.  A remarkable memoir!!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-21

This retrospective from this award-winning Irish gay novelist is a very informative, enlightening, and opinionated reading for anyone, but especially gay readers, interested in gay literature.  The author's aim was to write a book about a group of authors and their books that he read in his youth, that deeply influenced him, and that he discovered only years later were by gay authors.  These authors became companions that had the same interests as he did.  Toibin examines the lives of such authors as; Thomas Mann, James Baldwin, Roger Casement, and poets Mark Doty, and Thom Gunn.  These authors are some of the most influential gay writers of our time, but some had to keep their sexuality hidden by choice or necessity.  I enjoyed all of Toibin's examinations of these fine authors but after reading Toibin's chapter about Roger Casement's \\"Black Diaries\\", which were supposedly vivid records of his sexual partners, I'm still left wondering whether or not they really existed. <BR> <br />This book shows how deeply serious this author is about his love of books.  You will walk away with an entirely new view of the life and work of these authors who have clearly influenced Toibin's life.  It is a book that makes you think of your own favorite authors and how they have affected your life.  This is a wonderful book, like no other I have read.

I think it would be correct to say that this posthumously published memoir by a legend in the Fashion Industry was a little superficial.  This is not a bad thing, but one could only hope that Blass would have opened up more about his personal life.  He was a very handsome man, who happened to be gay, and not much of this part of his life is mentioned.  This is understandable for his generation and the time.  Another reason perhaps is because of the part he played in New York Society, and the people who surrounded him and admired him his entire life.  He wanted to be a class act, looked-up to, and a proper gentleman and he will always be remembered as just that.  Blass practiced style, lived and breathed it.  He was an iron disciplinary, style & work came first, laughter and fun later.<br />This book is like an encyclopedia of encounters with the rich and famous, and well-dressed people of the world.  He loved being photographed with the Reagan's, Buckley's, Kissinger's, and Vanderbilt's.  His contribution to fashion, the beautiful fabrics, and well-designed clothes are legendary.  Over the years, his designs stood above all the rest in New York.  This book is a great introduction to the world that Bill Blass wanted to show us, a world he loved, created and played a big part in.  A giant in the fashion industry that will be truly remembered, and a man of class.  A perfect gentleman!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-20

After his defection to the West, his life takes on fame, love, loss, exile, and the fairy tale life & behavior of the world's greatest dancer. <BR> <br />McCann hides nothing in his storytelling of the life of this man.  He shows us all sides of Nureyev; the irrational behavior of a prima donna, his desire for casual sex, the hidden world of the gay scene, and his arrest for [ludeness] during an interval of a performance.  What may be fact or fiction is hard to say, but it doesn't really matter.  Whether this is the real Nureyev or not, this story is full of passion and beautifully told.  The story from beginning to end is both breathtaking and heartbreaking from Nureyev's entrance to his exit.<BR>  <br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-17

This book is so entertaining you will swear you're watching your favorite comedy show on TV.  Buckley is one of the best political novelists of our generation.  This story is brilliantly plotted, and the characters will remind you in a positive way perhaps of former White House residents.  You know who I mean!<br />First Lady, Elizabeth Tyler MacMann, is charged with killing her philandering husband after he is found dead one night in bed.  It so happens that earlier that evening he had spent time in bed with his mistress, Babette.  After a bedroom spat, the first lady allegedly hurled a spittoon at him, with tragic results, or were they?  Elizabeth (Beth) is put on trial for assassinating the president.  Beth hires \\"Shameless\\" Baylor as her lawyer, who also had a steamy relationship with the first lady in the past.  As the story twists and turns it gets funnier and more entertaining than one could ever imagine.  What's to become of the First Lady?  Is she really the killer or has she been set-up?  <br />This is first-rate humor from an author who knows how to entertain his readers and keep them begging for more.  What will he write next?  I'm sure we will be surprised and again delighted.  Enjoy this creative novel.<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-17

Dan Savage has made a name for himself with his weekly column, \\"Savage Love\\" by answering endless questions about sex, love and relationships.  He's created a vast following with so many people because he listens with an open mind and then replies with honesty, intelligence, common sense, humor, and at times a fatherly voice.  This book will come as no surprise to most of his familiar readers; it's a sort of travelogue that sticks it to the likes of Bill Bennett and Dr. Laura and others, who have labeled most of the things he talks about in this book, evil and degenerate.  It's all about what Savage calls the seven deadly sins, and he pursues them with a vengeance in these seven chapters.  He takes ecstasy at a gay Pride parade, gets Gluttonous at a fat groups buffet, learns lessons in Lust from a swinging couple, and learns Envy when he meets the rich and beautiful at an ultra-spa.  That's just four of the seven deadly sins, wait to you read about Greed, Sloth, and Anger.<BR>  <br />Savage writes, \\"One man's moral and aesthetic pollution may be central to another man's pursuit of happiness\\".  How right he is.  And maybe he's right when he argues that this country would save a lot of money and aggravation if they authorized and regulated certain vices instead of outlawing them.  Savage makes a lot of good points.  You can't help but agree with a lot he has to say.  If you're tired of listening to all the nagging, proper, \\"Virtue\\" people out there who want to control every personal move you make, give this book a listen, and hear what the other side of logic has to say for a change!  Highly Recommended!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-16

All 176 pages of this book showcase seven young men who are on the verge of adulthood in natural settings in and out of doors.  What is intriguing about these photos is the playfulness of these very young, handsome men, who are naturally photogenic as they get naked and have fun in bed, in the woods, and in the bath.  These images will someday be a beautiful history and reminder to these young men of the time when they were at perfection in their youthful beauty.  Roffman knew two of these young men who introduced him to others, who were friends and some of them lovers.  Roffman is a wonderful photographer and each book he publishes seems to get better and bigger.  He certainly knows how to capture and freeze the beauty of youth, and his fans are thrilled that he does.  This book should be in every serious collector's library.  Touching and Tender, and beautifully designed!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-16

Franzen's rejection of talk-show queen Oprah this past year received about as much attention as his critically acclaimed book, \\"The Corrections\\".  By rejecting Oprah he became a literary hero overnight.  In this new collection, Franzen presents fourteen of his previously published essays.  They range in subject matter from the mishandling of the U.S. Postal Office in Chicago, the way a supermax prison works, his father's struggle with Alzheimer's disease, privacy issues, the tobacco industry, etc.  Franzen certainly covers a broad range of subjects.  They are well-written, reveal a great deal of wisdom, and exhibit well placed anger and frustration.  Franzen's revised essay of the 1996 Harper's outburst against the terrible state of the American novel shows his intention to move away from his angry isolation.<BR>  <br />Franzen poses many questions, making you really think, even though there aren't any definite answers.  I know, long after finishing this book, I have continued to think about what he said in these essays.  I think Franzen has a clear perspective of American society, and some of the criticism thrown his way is over exaggerated.  He gives us food for thought in these essays, and a chance to truly understand how to be alone.<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-15

What does it matter if this book is based on stereotypes or is not politically correct, it's a good way to spend a few hours of light reading, and be entertained at the same time.  The author was even nice enough to give us a \\"Warning\\" at the beginning of the book, so the reader can proceed at his own risk, and not have any misconceptions.  This book is beautifully illustrated throughout by Reuter with appropriate drawings for each section.  It is divided into ten sections that include; gaywear, gaybody, gayness, gayspeak, and much more.<BR>  <br />Whether you are new on the scene or have been around for quite sometime, this book will more than likely have something new to teach you.

It tells the story of 16-year old Pi Patel, a young zookeeper's son, who ends up stranded on a raft in the middle of the ocean with a 450 pound Bengal tiger named Parker on board with him.  The circumstances leading up to Patel's being stranded on the raft and the unbelievable experiences he goes through, along with his overactive imagination, are what make this book truly exciting and a joy to read.  It makes you wonder if you were in the same circumstances, would you be able to survive at sea alone for 227 days.  The first part of the book discusses the idea of incorporating the world's religions and it seemed to drag on much too long.  The story redeemed itself in the second half with the boy's adventure on the sea, and the complicated and unexpected turn of events that bring the story to a close. <BR> <br />There was much more to this story than I expected.  It's true, I didn't care for some parts of it, but I was very impressed with the second half of the book, and surprised by the way it ended.  It will make you think about what is and isn't reality.  It's a book to contemplate and read more than once.  This is one of those books I will always remember!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-12

This book is a stunning achievement and a must for any collector or fan of Gladiator movie posters that were produced during the period of 1959-1965.  Chapman had his work cut out for him in gathering this comprehensive collection, and he did a terrific job.  These color posters are from around the world and feature complete descriptions and author's commentary about each poster that is quite fascinating.  Who can forget \\"Hercules\\" Steve Reeves, the first to debut in a gladiator movie, in his skimpy loincloth, his muscles rippling, and the frail beautiful women he had to save from the evil tyrants.  People all over the world couldn't wait for the next Gladiator movie to be released to their theaters; they were new, sexy, dramatic, erotic, and filled with many different musclemen who followed in Steve Reeve's shoes.  This was an era that was fresh and new to everyone who wanted something different and exciting to watch at the movies.  They were our heroes, and our fantasy.

He usually brings out the sensual and passionate moods of all his good-looking models.  I was a little disappointed with this collection of color male-nude images of the \\"Boyz of Miami\\".  First of all, there's not a boy in sight, most are mature men.  Second, there seem to be a lack of emotion or passion in these shots.  I am surprised, as he usually captures more feelings and sensuality when photographing his male models.  I think it may be the angles, the choppy images, the heads cropped out, the extreme close-ups, and the bland shots of the models not knowing how to pose that leaves a lot to be desired in this collection.  Heidemann has great talent, but whoever selected these images, should have left them by the wayside.  Hopefully, the next collection of his images will be better.<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-08

These guys know how to pose so sensually that the heat just pours off the pages.  There are 120 pages of beautifully photographed color images here that only Cadinot with his skilled perfectionism could produce.  He knows how to bring out the passion and sensuality in all his models, which results in provocative and seething images.<br />A great introduction by Gerard Nemour is very informative, and will familiarize anyone with the work of Cadinot.

Shepard, the well-known playwright and actor, has written eighteen brief stories that are filled with unforgettable images.

Shepard is at his best with these stories as he clearly and effortless describes the sorrows, joys, and fallibility of everyday life.<BR>  <br />I enjoyed all of Shepards stories in his second collection of fiction. It would be hard to choose any one favorite, but Blinking Eye is one I will never forget.  It will leave an unforgettable image on your mind.  It is about a young girl driving cross-country bearing an urn containing her mothers ashes when she encounters an injured hawk on the side of the road.  She decides to take the injured hawk to a veterinarian for help.  What happens after she places the hawk in her car will definitely leave a vivid image in your mind forever.  <br />Shepards gift of writing is effortless to read for he brings all of his stories to life in a clear, concise, and beautifully detailed matter.

Yasmina Reza is the author of the Tony Award winning play \\"Art\\" and it is evident from the beginning paragraph of this debut novel that this author is very familiar with the stage.  Written in monologue form, the story gives voice to the ravings and complaints of an old man named Samuel Perlman.  Samuel is complaining most of the time about his adult son, from whom he feels estranged.  This is a son he feels is lazy, \\"rotting in leisure\\", and who has no ambition or passion in his life.  In analyzing his son's misguided life, he starts to reflect upon his own life, his marriages, love affairs, and close friendships.   Could it be he is terrified of his own daily monotony?  Loneliness, solitude and Samuel's inability to escape his own unhappiness or daily routine are perhaps his greatest enemy? <BR> <br />This is a brilliantly written first novel that is humorous funny, sad, heartbreaking, uplifting and disturbing all at the same time.  You get a sense of just how fragile life is and how hard it is to escape one's final destination.  One has to look beyond the complaints of Samuel to really know him.  Excellent.

I sincerely envy this photographer's daily life, and at the same time thank him for sharing with us his passion of capturing the many facets of male beauty.  These youthful models are not offensively erotic and a pleasure to behold.  These black & white images clearly demonstrate what a talented eye Lozon has for showcasing these young and muscular men in very provocative and arresting photos.

This book is a step back in history narrated in the language of the times, which is quite realistic.  It is told from a quite different viewpoint, not of Oscar Wilde, but beautifully described by his black valet who accompanied Oscar on his nationwide American tour.  The book starts out in January 1882, as Oscar arrives in New York to begin his tour.  At the time no mention was made in the press of his black valet named William Traquair, who accompanied him.  As Wilde entertains the New World with his lectures and humor, Traquair enjoys what he will always remember as the best year in his life.  <br />This is an engrossing and intriguing story that certainly gives us a much clearer perspective on what it must have been like in America at the turn of the century and especially what impact this time period had on black men.<BR>  <br />A story that?s both fact and fiction, and one that will make you fantasize that you are right there on tour with Wilde and Traquair traveling across America at a time when life on this continent was so young and open to suggestion.  I enjoyed this story and I feel the author has accomplished what he intended to do by taking us clearly back in time!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-05

Heidemann has included athletes, fighters, wrestlers, musclemen, fetish images (body painting, sheer clothing), and full frontal nudes.  It is an interesting book for this reason - it covers a wide variety of taste.  This is my introduction to this photographer, and I found his unique unconventional style of posing his models very interesting.  The book is well-designed, and somewhat larger (11.40 x 8.40 in.) than most that are being published today.  I look forward to more from this wonderful photographer!<BR>  <br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-04

Is there any hope of finding the right boyfriend for any of these four New York single gay men in this light and fun debut book by Jon Jeffrey?  What are these guys really looking for in another man? And are they expecting way too much?  Carson St. John, editor of the hip \\"Throb\\" gay magazine, comes up with a great idea/gimmick (you will have to discover what this is by reading the book) to help he and his friends find the right Boyfriend Material at one of their regular Sunday brunch discussions.  All four friends, Danny, Nathan, Rob, and Carson certainly have questionable taste in boyfriends.  Will Carson's idea/gimmick help them all to find everything they ever thought they wanted in a man, or lead them all on an endless adventure all over NYC in hopes of discovering that special man? <BR> <br />This is another fun book, that's romantic and cute, although a little over dramatic at times, but perfect for anyone who wants an easy, light-hearted read.  You can take a break, forget all that seriousness in your life, and veg-out for while on this one.  If Jeffrey's imagination can develop fun-loving characters like these, he definitely has a future in keeping us entertained in his future endeavors.

Is it possible a well-adjusted gay-man, hunky Adam, from a small-town called Eau Claire, Wisconsin, can find true love, sex, good friends and happiness all in one place?  Yes, this is a feel good book, but who cares, it's a lot of fun.  Sometimes we need a break from all the stories of tragedy, death, suicide, and unhappiness.  Beck knows how to weave a realistic, heartfelt story, with dependable characters.<br />As Adam temporarily moves to New York to help one of his better clients, he becomes fast friends with Blythe, a painter, and with her help adjusts very quickly to living in the city.  At a party, Adam catches a glimpse of Jeremy, the most beautiful man he has ever seen.  Jeremy is not only very handsome and intelligent, but a television actor.  The rest of the story continues with all sorts of funny and wild escapades, including a visit to a spiritual retreat, some stolen computer disks, drag queens, break-ins, and....Well, you'll just have to see what happens for yourself.  However, its Adam's pursuit of Jeremy that is the main theme of the story as he tries to find out if \\"He's the One\\".<br />This is a book that not only gay readers will enjoy but anyone who has ever fallen in love at first sight, and did things they wouldn't normally do in pursuing that love.

All of these twenty-one refreshingly candid interviews with gay men are about their sexual preferences and the reasons behind their choices.  This is not a study about right or wrong when it comes to anal eroticism, but a study of what it means for gay men to be a Top, Bottom, or Versatile.  The author interviews gay men in Boston and Provincetown.  Each interview is like a coming out story, totally refreshing and honest.  The information presented in the interviews is there for your individual interpretation, or merely for your reading enjoyment.  That such a taboo subject is finally laid out in print in such an informal and intelligent manner is quite an achievement by Underwood and long overdue. <BR> <br />These interviews read more like short stories than gay study interviews as you get a history of each gay man's sexual experiences, and their opinions about anal eroticism.  It is to the credit of the author that he does not get in the way by asking questions, but lets each man speak for himself and reveal his own personal history and beliefs.  These are heart-felt confessions that will get you thinking, questioning and reviewing your own life.  These are real people who talk honestly about their sexual lives, desires and obsessions.<BR>  <br />This is a great book for any gay male who is just coming-out.  It should be included in any gay curriculum or gay study group.  It is an excellent overview of how all of these different gay men have dealt with coming out, their first sexual experiences, the reason for their sexual preferences, and how it has affected their lives.  I wish this honest and helpful book had been available when I was first coming out.  These are thoughtful, courageous, humorous, and touching interviews.  Steven Underwood's excellent introduction says it all, and especially his statement, \\"that equality in man-to-man sex is as varied as the number of individuals who strive for it.\\"  That says it all.  Highly Recommended!!!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-01

Appeal is a perfect title for this collection of images of young male models that are just coming into adulthood.  These young men are very handsome, erotic, and innocent looking all at the same time.  The images are not pornographic in any way, meaning no frontal nudity.  They are images of very happy and smiling young men who love to act-out in front of the camera.  These shots taken by this young good-looking photographer are of youths he discovered in clubs, on the streets, or at the beach.  Horvath has a way of knowing when to snap a photo; when the lighting is perfect and the shadows cast the perfect mood.  Most of these black & white and color shots of various sizes are taken outdoors.<br />This is a collection of beautiful images from a new talented photographer that are very appealing.  I look forward to Volume 2, and I know I will not be disappointed if it is anything like his first volume.  Perfect!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-01

We have seen so many coming-out novels published in the past few years that one could say it's starting to be overdone, but this new novel about 17 year old Noah, is very effective and shows great originality.  There are so many issues going on in the lives of these well-developed characters, that it takes a while to grasp it all, but you will, and it's quite a story from the beginning to end. <BR> <br />Noah, a closeted gay teenager, is dealing with his father's death, his adjustment to living in rural New Hampshire after moving from urban Chicago, and his mother's growing madness as she discovers a terrible dark secret in the new house as she finds mason jar after mason jar between the walls filled with letters, poems, and other strange things while renovating the house.  On top of all this, Noah's blossoming love for his new neighbor, J.D., a handsome 16 year-old, creates more issues as well.  J.D. is living a horrific home life, with an alcoholic father and a bigoted mother.  Yes, there's much, much more to this story.  You'll have to discover the rest for yourself.  Yates has the creative touch to explore all these issues, and many more not mentioned, and still bring it all together in the end.<BR>  <br />If you want an honest, intelligent, well-crafted story to read, this is the book for you.  Yates is a fine writer, who has a great future ahead of him.  This is a book to really get absorbed in, and forget the world around you for a while.  Spend some time with these dysfunctional families, and your own life will take on a whole new light.  Highly recommended!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-04-01

This is one of the most fascinating books of male nude photography that has ever been published.  This photographer has quite an imagination and a talent in offering up a dream-like, very erotic display of male beauty.   The shots in \\"Luxure\\" are primarily from the calendar series \\"Erotika\\" and \\"Alchemy\\", and includes images created for the Sydney 2000 Olympics.  There are 80 pages of sepia-tone and color images of aggressively masculine nude men, in fantasy, mythology & fetish outfits, as well as the four season's images that will remind you of Pierre & Gilles style of photography.<BR> <br />Richard de Chazal is one of Australia's top haute-couture designers, and photographers.  He has a style all his own, which is truly brilliant and unique in its conception and finality.  This is a beautifully designed book, though not large, with a soft leather-like cover.  This is one of my favorite books from a photographer who I hope publishes more of his beautiful images in the near future. <BR> <br />Joe Hanssen	2003-03-30

Marc Bessange has produced a collection of black & white male semi-nude photos here that are simple, yet beautiful and creative in there presentation.  There are no props, fantasy settings, fetish images.  There are just good-looking, young, masculine males who seem very relaxed before the camera.  These are reality shots of these male models, posing the way they want, in a natural way.  There is no frontal nudity, and I believe this makes these poses even more sensual than if they were nude.  These guys either have attitude or they don't, it is up to them.  This is to Bessange's credit that he lets his models take control, and be themselves in all of his work.  This is a fine collection from a very talented photographer.  The cover photo is one of my favorites, and I think you will enjoy this collection.  Check it out!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-03-30

Lawrence Schimel (aka David Laurents) knows how to write a gay story that is not only sexy but intelligent, and why shouldn't they be intelligent as well as sexy for a change of pace.  This sets Schimel's book apart from most of the other books being published with all sex and no real storyline.  There is actually some substance to these tales.  They're a definite turn-on, and explicit, while dealing at the same time with issues of monogamy, safe sex, open relationships, and fantasy.<BR>  <br />I enjoyed all of these stories, but my favorites were; \\"Season's Greetings\\" and \\"A Queer Christmas Carol\\".  As you can tell, I have a thing for Christmas themed stories.  I thought the story about a blender; \\"A Blend of Food and Desire\\" was really funny and erotically written. <BR> <br />So throw all those other erotic books away and give this one a read.  It is a book you will want to keep on your nightstand when you want something erotic as well as intelligent to read.  Schimel has done a great job with this collection, and the cover art by Bel Ami is perfect.  Enjoy!!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-03-28

There's no question about it, this is one of the best books I have ever read.  Besson has done a brilliant job in this first novel that is a combination of fact and fiction.  I haven't been this excited about a book in a long time.  This is an emotional story that is charming, erotic, sensitive, inventive, and lined with exquisite details of this period in history.<br />It's 1916 in Paris, and the Great War has been ravaging Europe for two years now.  Vincent, who is 16 years old, a privileged young man, feels far removed from the horrors of the war as he is left behind in the city with mostly women.  Thus Paris is a city \\"In the Absence of Men\\".  Vincent's life is about to change forever as he meets two of the most important men in his life.  On this beautiful and sunny day he befriends Marcel Proust, the forty-five year-old elegant and gifted writer, and Arthur Vales, who is home on leave for a week from the war, and who is the son of a family servant.  Vincent begins a platonic friendship with Marcel that turns into a sort of mentor relationship.  They spend many hours together in cafes, literary salons, and at the Ritz.  On the other hand, Arthur awakens in Vincent feelings of love, and they begin a week of discovery of deep, emotional, sensual and physical love that is a coming of age for both young men.  As the week ends, Marcel has to go away on business, and Arthur returns to the front lines of war.  Vincent is once again alone in Paris.  At this point, the story takes the form of letters between Vincent and Arthur, and Vincent and Marcel.  It's in these letters that we learn how Vincent's life is altered forever, by a tragic event, and an unexpected confession.<br />It's amazing that a writer can cause us to get so involved with a book, and leave such a lasting impression.  I know I will never forget this story, and I know I'll read it again and again.  This is a book of love, of hope, of sorrow, and of survival.  This is a touching story from a new and great writer, no question about it!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-03-27

This book is geared toward young adults (high school age), but I feel it's a book all ages can enjoy and benefit from, especially parents who want to better understand their gay son or daughter, and the difficulties they face while in high school.<BR>  <br />Russel is convinced he's the only gay student at GoodKind High until his online gay-chat buddy turns out to be another student, Kevin, who is the popular closeted star baseball player of the school.  Soon Russel learns his best female friend, Min, and her girlfriend, Therese, and another student called Ike, are also gay.  They now have to figure out how they can all get together for talks without drawing attention to themselves.  This leads them to form a club called \\"Geography Club\\".  Is the \\"Geography Club\\" the answer to their problems, or will peer pressure, insecurities, unexpected members and other events, take a toll on their developing friendship, and their new club.<br />Hartinger has written a very realistic, fast-paced story filled with love, hope, humor, and sadness that will touch anyone's heart.  These young students are individuals who are mature beyond their years.  The author has done a brilliant job in getting his message across by developing characters that are very believable.  We need more sensitive, intelligent writing like this that can help all young people deal with being different, especially at a time when there are so many other pressures for them to bear.  It's rough to be young in today's world.  This is a book I recommend for all.  Please don't miss this one!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-03-26

Donald Strachey and his lover, Timmy take a trip to Washington, D.C. to visit their friend Maynard, and to go see the AIDS Memorial Quilt.  All goes well until they discover a panel for Maynard's ex-lover, who is alive and well, and whom Maynard had just seen two weeks ago while in Mexico.  Now the action has begun.  As this fast paced mystery continues, there's a drive-by shooting, and the police even suspect Donald and Timmy are involved.  This is a gripping story that is filled with carefully crafted and unexpected turns, which kept me turning the pages as fast as I could read them.  This is the reason I look forward to these \\"Strachey\\" mysteries.  They are intelligently written, and often laced with good-natured humor. <BR> <br />If you have never read Stevenson's mysteries, you are missing out on some great writing.  I think once you have read one, you will want to read the whole series.  They are all connected, but can be read independently.  This is another one of Stevenson's master mysteries, and one I really enjoyed.  I look forward to every book he publishes.  I just wish he would put more than one out a year.

If you've read one of Stevenson's \\"Donald Strachey\\" mysteries, you will want to read the whole series, and then you will be eagerly waiting for his next mystery to be published.  Stevenson's mysteries are addictive, mainly because the characters are so believable, there are more twists and turns to keep you constantly guessing, and they are not boringly serious, they can be quite funny at times.<br />This story opens as Albany's gay Private Investigator, Donald Strachey, is asked to investigate the death of Phyllis Haig's, gay son, Paul.  Apparently the mother believes his lover, Larry, killed Paul, and that it was not a suicide as the police seem to believe.  Vernon Crockwell enters the story as the controversial psychologist whose practice is devoted to \\"curing\\" homosexuals.  Strachey ends up with three clients who want to hire him, to find out the truth, but Strachey soon becomes aware there are a lot of unanswered questions.  As the story reveals, Paul Haig's death is much more complicated then he expected.  Prepare yourself for a lot of surprises with this one.<br />The interaction between Donald Strachey and his long-time partner, Timmy, is always well done, and very realistic.  All lovers of good mysteries, whether gay or heterosexual, will appreciate this book.  Stevenson is a fine writer who knows how to weave a shocking and gripping mystery.<BR>  <br />Joe Hanssen	2003-03-25

This is the beginning of an exciting, entertaining, and educational new series of books about Sunbirds.  I am usually not inclined to read and review children's books, but because of my love for birds of all species, I found this book just too hard to resist.<BR>  <br />This young and talented new author bases his story on the actual birds he raises.  The story is about pheasants and peacocks and their interactions with each other and their owner.  The birth of a new peachick (to be later named Mocha) is a emotional learning experience for the reader who may never have had the joy of watching a bird hatch and enter the world, survive and develop.  The interaction between Andrew (their Raiser) and the Sunbirds is cleverly described and very funny at times.  As the story progresses, the Sunbirds end up in some very exciting, and unbelievable situations that will make you think twice the next time you see a bird.  It will also expand your imagination.  You will not, believe me, be able to put the book down once you start to read it.  That's all I can tell you with out ruining the story.<br />This first book in the series is so much fun to read, and certainly one that people of all ages, especially children, young adults, and young at heart older adults will enjoy.  I am so happy I discovered this book, and I look forward to the further adventures of the Sunbirds, and more from this very talented author.  Highly recommended!<br />Joe Hanssen	2003-03-23

Once in a while you read a book where you actually feel the author is having a personal conversation with you as he relives and tells you about his life experiences.  You become so absorbed in the story he is telling you that you forget that the present world exists around you.  That's the way I felt while reading Joseph Itiel's book about his gay sexual travel adventures and experiences.  He reveals the many fascinating, exciting, and erotic sexual experiences he has had with men of different nationalities over the last four decades.  He begins with his first sexual experiences in the1950's in NYC and Toronto, and his first foreign adventure to Rishikesh, India, where he became an apprenticed yogi.  By taking up yoga he was able to cover up his homosexual activities while living in India.  After all, this was the 1950's.  This trip was not the wonderful experience he had hoped it would be.  It did confirm and teach him, however, that his most satisfying sexual experiences would come from males who were ethnically and culturally different from him and he soon discovered he was also assured a more pleasurable sexual experience when he paid for it.  Thus, his life-long positive relationships with male \\"hustlers\\", now known as \\"sex workers\\", would be established. <BR> <br />We're taken all over the world on his many sexual travel adventures, from Toronto to Mexico, to the Philippines, Japan, London, Hong Kong, Manila, and numerous other places.  This book is a truly fascinating confession of his private life told in a beautiful, honest, and very personal way.  I especially enjoyed his chapters titled \\"The Dancing Boy\\", \\"A Tiny Room at the Inn\\", and \\"Four Japanese Tales.\\"  The characters he meets, from callboys, to male geisha's and other sexual workers, are fascinating.  His Manila diary entries were interesting, intriguing, humorous and sad at the same time, especially when he talks about the \\"psychic surgery\\" patients he met.  They are interesting beyond belief.  <br/>Although all of these foreign sexual encounters are fascinating and very erotically described, there's even more to this wonderful book.  In addition, it's a real learning adventure for any gay man who plans to be or is a world traveler.  The knowledge and experiences Joseph presents to us are as relevant today as when he first traveled on his annual pilgrimages.  Joseph has always had an insatiable curiosity and desire to learn new languages and study other countries customs.  It's through his experiences that we get to share an intellectual and sexual history of one gay man's adventures as a world traveler.<br />I started reading this book early one evening and couldn't put it down till early the next day.  We can certainly learn a lot from other's experiences and that is definitely true in this case.  It will take you away, excite you, and open your eyes, all at the same time.  I truly enjoyed and highly recommend this book.  I look forward to this author's future endeavors.  ...	2003-03-18

I could tell you what a captivating and interesting book this is to read.  Or I could tell you how well-developed the characters are, or how brutally honest, shocking and realistic this story is, but I dont think you should take my word for it.  I think you should discover for yourself this talented new African American writer.  Whether this story is based on fact or fiction, it will keep you interested to the end, and looking forward to a sequel.<br />Arthur Wilson is a young man who comes from a severely dysfunctional family, and whose father is physically and mentally abusive to both he and his mother.  Add to this the fact that his mother is very ill, and therefore at a point where she is quite helpless in changing the situation.  Arthur is a talented musician and an excellent student, but no matter what he does, its not the right thing in his fathers eyes.  So the abuse continues and Arthur decides to run away to Atlanta with his best friend Daniel to escape his unhappy home life.  In order to survive in the Big City Arthur & Daniel must turn to prostitution and drugs.  At this point, the story unfolds at a fast pace as Arthur sets out on a series of bus trips as he experiences his coming out from boyhood to manhood.  <br />I also enjoyed the poetry by Nicole J. Niblack dispersed throughout the story.  These classically styled poems are beautiful and serve an integral purpose as part of the story.  Nicole is a gifted poet who understands the power of words, and I look forward to reading more of her work. <BR> <br />So discover this captivating treasure of a book for yourself.  I look forward to Caesars sequel to this story, Things Found in My Fathers Attic, that revisit the characters of Journeys of a Tortured Soul some 20 years later.  Hail, Caesar!!!	2003-03-18

All of Murakami's novels are best sellers, and he is perhaps the most recognized and noted Japanese author in the U.S. and around the world.  Murakami is one of my favorite authors.  I have enjoyed all of his previous novels, and now this little book of short stories kept me turning the pages past the midnight hour.  Murakami drew me in with his simple language and the powerful dialogue of his intriguing characters.  These six stories are all related to the devastating Kobe earthquake of 1995.  The stories are set in the months between the natural disaster and the poison gas attacks that occurred in Tokyo's subways.  Both of these events dramatically changed the physical and social landscape of Japan.  For each of the characters in these stories, the earthquake's emotional aftershock set off an unreal chain of events.<br />I enjoyed all of these stories, but a few were my favorites.  In \\"Super-Frog Saves Tokyo\\", a loan-collector teams up with a man-sized frog to fight an enormous worm that threatens to destroy Tokyo.  In \\"Landscape With Flatiron\\", we learn about Miyake's passion in building bonfires with his companion Junko, and what it all symbolizes.  And last but not least, in \\"Honey Pie\\", we are presented with a complex, passionate story about a love triangle that takes place over many years. <BR> <br />We are exposed to a lot of human suffering in these stories.  Murakami, however,  sheds light and hope in all of these stories by showing us the courage, strength, and compassion these devastated people possess in overcoming any tragedy that they may have to face.  I always look forward to Murakami's new novels.  Now, I can, hopefully, look forward to more short stories by this talented author.  This is a beautifully written collection of stories.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did! <br />Joe Hanssen	2002-10-10

I, for one, tried to like this book, but when I FINALLY finished it, I felt totally disappointed and cheated.  I make it a point not to read other people's reviews before I read a book, that way I am not influenced by their thoughts and feelings, whether positive or negative.  This is another story with the same plot that we have heard so many times before.  It is about rich kids who love to party, do drugs, have unsafe sex, get drunk, and then get violent.  I felt really disgusted with the ending. <BR> <br />The only reason I gave this book three stars was that I thought the main character, White Mike, might turn out to have some redeeming value.  What did not make sense to me was the fact that White Mike did not smoke, take drugs, or drink.  Yet, he was out there getting rich, dealing and destroying young lives, and nobody seemed to care.  He was \\"too clean\\" to be realistic.  As for the writing style, this must be the new acceptable writing style of young novelists today, short, choppy, and terse.  If the ending had been different, I might have taken a more positive approach in reviewing this story.  Instead, I felt the ending was a cop-out. <BR> <br />I think McDonell could turn out to be a good writer, given another year or two, if he had a more realistic, interesting, or unique story to tell.  This is a debut novel, by a very young author, so perhaps his next book will surprise us all!<br />Joe Hanssen	2002-10-08

This may be a small book of only 128 pages, but it is a \\"Treasure Chest of Information\\".  This is a collection of true stories about one of America's greatest towns.  If you have ever had an interest in this unique town, whether as a historian, visitor, or a resident, you will love these fascinating, sometimes humorous, stories taken from the town memoirs.  Kathy Shorr has created a delightful book covering the history of \\"Provincetown\\", Land's End\\", during the Eighteenth, Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries.<BR>  <br />The author writes about the settlers who first landed in Provincetown in 1620, (not in Plymouth, as commonly believed), the floating of the houses from Long Point, the first Town Crier, the birth of the Art Colony, the building of the Pilgrim Monument, the Rose Dorothea, and the birth of The Cape Cod National Seashore.  In later chapters, she touches on the \\"Meat Rack\\", Spiritus, Hurricane Bob, the yearly Carnival, and the Blessing of the Fleet.  Interspersed throughout the book are appropriate illustrations by Anne Rosen relating to each story.  Shorr writes these stories in an intelligent, exciting, and fun manner that make this book a gratifying and enjoyable read. <BR> <br />This book should not be missed if you have an interest and curiosity about this town at \\"Land's End\\".  I wish this book was getting the fanfare that other \\"Provincetown\\" books are receiving.  This book is very special, and I feel one of the best books published about this town.

Mark Doty in his latest collection of poems, continues to delight and entertain us with his brilliant style of writing that is elegant, compassionate, and unabashedly, and proudly gay.  These poems are of a universal language, speaking to all sexual orientations, for they are not all gay themed verses.  Doty's poems are always a real pleasure to read for they speak from the heart on subjects that are important and of interest to many of us who share his same ideals, thoughts, and feelings.  I have always been a fan of his poems for that reason.  As he describes the degradation of Walt Whitman's vision of a democratic America in \\"Letter to Walt Whitman\\", or of the joy and entertainment that \\"Little Kaiser\\" brings to so many people in \\"Private Life\\", I can not help but smile at the joy he sees and experiences in trying to get close to Whitman, and in exploring the inner thoughts of \\"Little Kaiser\\".  I have to admit I am a little prejudiced toward these two lovely poems, for each has references to companion parrots.  I loved the poem, \\"Letter to Walt Whitman\\" that Doty wrote after touring Whitman's home in Camden.  He was trying to find something there that would make Whitman seem more real and still alive.  He did when he discovered Whitman's parrot preserved by the taxidermist's wax, and wrote, \\"Then one thing made you seem alive: your parrot.\\"  And in \\"Private Life\\" we learn all about \\"Little Kaiser\\" the African Grey parrot, who has been a fixture for many years at the local headshop on Commercial Street in Provincetown.  Doty has a way of describing all life beings with the beauty they so rightly deserve. <BR> <br />This sixth book of verse by Mark Doty is one I will be returning to many, many times.  The poems in this collection cover a wide variety of subjects, and this creates an opportunity for everyone to find one of interest to them that will definitely become a favorite.  The several poems he writes about Provincetown, a town I have come to care about and call a second home over the past quarter century, are my favorites.  Doty seems to have the same feelings for this special place that I have.  It is the beauty of his words that keep me looking forward to and eagerly awaiting his next collection of poems.

Go Go!&quot;	I know what I want to say, but it's hard to find the right words to describe how much I enjoyed this entertaining story by this talented new writer.  I lost some sleep over this book.  A riveting and captivating book that is rich with beautiful prose.  It tells the story of a boy, named Kevin Schuler from Missouri, who is a gifted runner.  This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Jackson lets us experience every detail of Kevin's life, through his eyes, as he struggles with grief, small-town celebrity, and conflicting inner thoughts as he prepares for and wins several 800 and 1600 meter races for his high school.  This is a coming-of-age story as well, as Kevin finds himself experiencing and accepting the love of a sensitive girl named Henny.  If you have never been on a track team, or even if you have, you will find you know everything there is to know about being a track star and what it takes to win after reading this book.  I found myself very impressed by Kevin and felt like I knew him after reading his story.  This is the mark of a good author, who has had done a magnificent job in developing this character, as well as the other main characters.  Kevin has a wise, witty &amp; low-keyed way of looking at life that is really cool.  What happens after the accident, the memory loss, his quick rise to fame and other unexpected events  will keep you glued to the book and wondering what's going to happen next, and how it will all turn out for Kevin.<BR>  <br />Some authors have a natural born talent for writing beautiful, intelligent, and flowing prose.  I think Jeremy Jackson is one of them.  This is an intelligent and very enjoyable read from a writer who I hope will bring us more of his talented writing in the near future.  Enjoy this book, I know I did!<br />Joe Hanssen	2002-09-30

What a sentimental and beautifully told story.  A semi-autobiographical novel about a single man, who is a fiction writer, and adopts an 8 year-old boy named Dennis.  Dennis, who was abandoned by his mother, and listed by the adoption agency as \\"hard to place\\", is an unwanted child of many foster homes, who believes his real home is the planet Mars.  The story is based upon Gerrold's own experience as a single, gay, adoptive father.  However, Gerrold puts all the \\"gay\\" and \\"single\\" problems in the background, and focuses on the struggles, disappointments and obstacles, that make becoming & being an adoptive parent so difficult.  It's a wonder that any of these unfortunate, abandoned children ever get adopted, with all the red-tape and processing that one has to go through before adopting.  Gerrold finds Dennis more than a hand-full, with some difficult issues to resolve, but his perseverance, love, and dedication to his new son are stronger than any hardships he may have to endure.<BR>  <br />I found I got so involved in this story, I could not put it down, and finished the book in one night.  You will find yourself drawn into the emotional turmoil and heartache that the author faces, and celebrate in the joy that he finally realizes in sharing his love, home and happiness with his son.  As a single gay parent, Gerrold adds his name to the list of many gay men and lesbians who are helping to redefine family by giving these troubled and abused children an opportunity to live a life of love, happiness, and stability.  Three cheers for David Gerrold! A caring and dedicated father.<BR>  <br />Joe Hanssen	2002-09-30

In this bold and beautifully designed book, the bullfighter or \\"Torero\\" finally gets the attention he deserves, not as an object of the bull's attention, but as an object of desire, in a very sensual, yet masculine way.  This is not to say these images by this talented photographer are of torero's just showing off their erotic appeal in  tight costumes.  There are many other photos of the rooms, equipment and costumes in settings by themselves that are very artistically photographed.  The erotic appeal of the bullfighter is no longer censored and relegated to the background.  These black and white photographs display many nude and semi-nude poses of very handsome, young, and athletic men in their tight fitting torero costumes, where little is left to the imagination.  Afanador's admiration of male beauty is very apparent in this book of images.  He has an eye for capturing the attitude, machismo, and inherent beauty and vulnerability of these brave men.  I thought it was pleasing that Afanador features some of the torero's in their costumes on one page and nude on the opposite page in the same pose.<br />The poems by Gloria Marie Pardo Vargas, interspersed throughout the book, add to the enjoyment.  This is a large over-sized book that is beautifully designed and bound (included is a red ribbon marker) that is a must for any collector of male erotica or for anyone who has always had a fascination with torero's and their beautiful costumes.  I have only one regret, I would love to see a book of these same images in color showcasing the beautiful colors and patterns of the torero's costumes.  This is a book that I will enjoy over and over again.  As a collector, this is at the top of my list.<br />Joe Hanssen	2002-09-30

As Roy Blakey states in his forward, \\"BLAKEY'S RESURRECTION, just at first glance, might have made an arresting title for this book of male nudes, or perhaps the even more intimate \\"ROY'S RESURRECTION,\\" and he further states, \\"Nevertheless, I definitely have been resurrected.\\"  He thanks photographer Reed Massengill, now a close friend, who helped him to secure a gallery exhibition and with the publication of this book.  These male nude images from the 1970's have been stored away for many years.  If you were coming-of-age in the 70's, you may be familiar with Blakey's work and the publication HE.  I think it's great that his work is being exhibited, published and now is being introduced and made available to a whole new generation.<BR>  <br />If you liked the look of the men in the 70's, you will likely enjoy these photographs as much as I did.  They bring back many memories of that era, the long hair, the light bodies, the innocent looks and poses, and good-looking boy next door type male models.  I think these photographs are beautiful for the simple reason that Blakey is a \\"Master of Light and Shadow.\\"  All of these black and white images are posed with no props.  I believe the starkness of these images make the models more intimately sensual.  Roy Blakey was a former professional figure skater and as you view these photographs you can clearly see the influence that this has had in the way he posed his models.<BR>  <br />If the publication of this book is a dream come true for Blakey, then it is a dream come true for us as avid fans and collectors of male nude photography!  I sincerely hope he continues to browse through his storage boxes and releases  more of his photographic images for us to enjoy. A stunning collection!<BR>  <br />Joe Hanssen	2002-09-30

He has recorded some of the most beautiful, erotic, and explicit images of mature, handsome and muscular men in these pages.  He has been a major player in the world of nude male photography since the early 90's.  This book is the first part of his multimedia project, and his first endeavor into digital photography.  There are solos, couples, and three-ways displayed in these beautiful color photographs.  Bianchi's use of natural light brings out the artistic appeal and beauty of these handsome men.  The men in these photos are from all over the world, and they have given of themselves totally in exploring their personal boundaries, exhibitionism, and their masculine beauty.  This is a book you can spend hours looking over, and exploring, seeing more and more as you study these photos.  It's a nice change of pace from the swimming pools & ocean settings, to come indoors to more intimate surroundings.  I think this is Tom Bianchi's finest achievement yet.  I certainly look forward to his future volumes.  A great collector's item for your library!<br />Joe Hanssen	2002-09-26

If you think you have had a messed up childhood, after reading this book, you'll think again.  Augusten Burroughs, in his new memoir, bravely tells us about his twisted nightmare of an upbringing by his mother, her psychiatrist, and the doctor's weird family.  This was a hard book to read, and I kept telling myself this is not a memoir, it has to be fiction.  This story would leave anyone else grabbing their knees, cowering in a corner, and locked-up in a mental institution for the rest of their lives.  Burroughs manages to tell the story with wit and humor, and honesty.  We all have childhood memories we like to keep hidden, but I give Burroughs a lot of credit for exposing his abused childhood so candidly.  It's amazing that his life turned out so well after such a stressful, crazy and abused upbringing.<BR>  <br />Beautifully written, with real emotion, and yet horribly shocking, disturbing, and disgusting at times.  It is a difficult book to read, but one you will find yourself racing through to the finish line.  Things get so bad in the story, it forces you to laugh to get through another chapter.  A captivating read you should definitely not miss.<br />Joe Hanssen	2002-09-26

However, I was a little disappointed.  Yes, this would make a great story, but......after so many chapters of indecisive plotlines, it gets a little annoying.  The numbered outlines about his depression all become a little redundant when repeated again and again through-out the book.  And the fairy tale chapters intermingled through-out the book really ruined the flow of the book, and for no good reason.  The author states in Chapter 16, \\"Sometimes I think Sadie should be the one writing a book\\", \\"But not a rambly (his spelling), confessional sort of one like this\\".  I think that explains the whole problem with this book.  It rambles on a little too long, to the point where you do not care about these characters and their lives anymore.<BR>  <br />I gave this book three stars for one reason only, I found the story itself interesting, even if it was over-dramatized.  The story's protagonist is 29 year old Tommy, who lives in London.  He has a fear of commitment, doing without his daily drugs, and being unable to live a free and wild lifestyle.  He begins to question his life when he meets a new boyfriend with a son named Finn.  Can Tommy make a commitment, and at the same time become a father?  Can he give up drugs, and his wild nightlife?<br />This is a easy read, but I found by the end of the book, I could care less about the Tommy character, who is too self-centered, dramatic, and lacking in real emotion.  Charlie, Sadie and Bobby were much more likable.  Will I read the next book by Cumming's?  Yes.  This is a debut novel, so we will see if this fine screenwriter and actor, turns out to be a fine novelist in the future, too.<BR>  <br />Joe Hanssen	2002-09-26

Hanif Kureishi has managed to pack more honesty, pain, and intimacy into this small, 120 page novel than any author I have read.  It's brutally honest as well as heartbreaking, and captures the feelings of many people who are in relationships and struggling to stay together in our modern times.  Hanif vividly describes the fears, desires and challenges a man must face when he decides one night to leave his wife and two children, as he feels there is no more passion left in their relationship.  Is he making the right decision?  How will it effect his wife and children?  The fears and challenges the whole family faces, and how it all turns out, is surely an emotional read, and a lesson for anyone going through similar problems in a relationship.<BR>  <br />This is a great follow-up story from the author who wrote \\"MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE\\" and \\"THE BUDDHA OF SUBURBIA\\", and should not be missed.

This is a much needed and long awaited POSITIVE study of the contemporary gay male.  This book should have been written years ago as it puts into proper perspective the many important contributions gay males have made to our society and how these contributions have been ignored, dismissed  or overlooked.  It exposes the myths and lies about gay male lives, and opens up to all who read this book the true accomplishments gay men have made in this world.  It's an optimistic presentation and a valuable text for gay studies courses, or for anyone interested in the lives of gay men.  It's intelligently written, yet an easily understandable book for anyone to read, learn from, and enjoy.<BR>  <br />This book explains how gay men have developed a culture where violence is almost nonexistent; where new forms of friendship, intimacy, and relationships have been developed with less sexual jealousy; where gay men and straight women have forged lasting relationships; and where volunteerism for both straight and gay causes is much higher than other segments of the population.<BR>  <br />THE SOUL BENEATH THE SKIN was a positive joy to read.  It offers hope for those who are disappointed, and disillusioned with \\"the gay community\\" as it now stands.  This book is surely \\"the light at the end of the tunnel\\".  Hopefully, it will be read by all, gay and straight, so that a more appreciative understanding can be forged between all of us.  All of the thanks goes to David Nimmons for taking the time and effort to do such an in-depth study of gay men's lives and the positive contributions they have made to society.

You either love him or hate him, but one thing is for certain, once you start reading what Mark Simpson has to say about sex you won't be able to stop.  I, for one, was never bored or provoked by what he had to say.  Simpson has a way of making you think differently about sex.  This from an author who is both hated and respected.  You may not agree with his comments but you'll think twice about what he has to say.  These essays originally appeared in magazines like Attitude, the Independent, and Vogue Hommes International, etc.  I found these essays to be funny, sexy, informative, and intelligently written.  This book is a great follow-up to his other book, \\"IT'S A QUEER WORLD\\".<br />The book is divided into four sections; Dirty Words, Dirty Thoughts, Dirty Talk, and Dirty Books.  There are about forty-eight essays and six personal interviews included in this collection so it's hard to choose favorites.  Each and every one is thought-provoking, whether he's talking about President Clinton in \\"Slick Willy\\" (the Oval Office has become the Oral Office); or the Republican Reaction in \\"The Sex Terror\\"; or Brad Pitt in the \\"Pittfall of Being Brad Pitt\\" (a victim of his own beauty); or \\"Eminem Melts in Your Mouth\\"(is Eminem really what he appears to be?).  There's sure to be some serious eyebrows raised while reading some of these chapters.  Simpson's interviews with Aiden Shaw & Julie Burchill are not to be missed, fascinating.  He even confronts Henry Rollins with those `gay' rumors.<br />Simpson argues there is far too much faith put in sex these days, and it can be ultimately disappointing.  What is not disappointing is this book and reading his personal points of view.  You will certainly be entertained, educated, and never bored.  Perhaps you will even finding yourself thinking differently about sex.  This is a book that should be read by all.  Simpson really puts things in the proper perspective.

My wish has now come true.  Jay Quinn, who authored two other wonderful books, \\"METES AND BOUNDS\\" and \\"THE MENTOR\\" has gathered together twenty-two new southern gay stories.  These are exciting and touching  stories of awakening gay sexuality, and the impact that religion, friends and family have on their lives.  They are told from a Southern gay perspective.  There stories are from such noted authors as; Jeff Mann, Jameson Currier, Robin Lippincott, and Greg Herren, as well as many other new voices in Southern gay writing.  These are not erotic, sex-filled stories, but heartfelt renderings of what it is like to be gay, and from the south.  There's a feeling of Southern pride and heritage in each of these stories.  Whether you're gay or straight, a southern boy will always be a proud southern boy.<br /><br />All of these stories were a pleasure to read, but a few made quite an impression on me.  \\"Miles Away\\" by Martin Wilson, tells of Michael's first sexual experience; \\"Jesse: November 1992\\" by Felice Picano, relates the emotional impact of HIV on two lifetime partners, and \\"The Kitchen Table\\" by Jay Quinn, is a truly sexy and emotional love story of the developing attraction that Phil, has for Trace, the man whose house he is remodeling.<br /><br />Although the stories in this volume are universal in depictions of gay life in America today, they are a welcome addition for they are told by new voices, proud voices, from a perspective of different backgrounds, emotions and life experiences.  These are the voices of Southern gay men.  A wonderful book for gay adults to read, as well as parents and students who are trying to understand their gay son's sexual orientation.  Don't miss this one!  Could there be a REBEL YELL 3 coming?  I hope so!!!<br />Joe Hanssen	2002-07-19

An intelligent and cleverly written story that deals with facing or avoiding life's choices.  It's a page turner that will keep you guessing right from the beginning what the final outcome of the story will be.  Cameron, a gay author, best known for his novel, THE WEEKEND, has written an old-fashioned type of story that is a joy to read.<BR>  <br />Doctoral student Omar Razaghi wants to write a biography of deceased author Jules Gund.  The three executors of the Gund's estate; Caroline, his wife; Arden, his mistress; and his gay brother, Adam, deny Omar's request for permission to write an authorized biography.  Omar realizes his only chance to change their minds is to make an unexpected trip to their home in Uruguay.  At this point in the story, Omar's whole life seems to become unraveled.  Omar is hurled into the center of a cast of mixed-up characters' lives and relationships.  Only an author like Cameron could dream up these people, and it's through his talented writing that these characters develop into loving, caring and feeling people.  Will Omar be able to face or will he avoid the choices set before him?  <br />I enjoyed this satisfying and hypnotic story.  A good book to relax with and spend a couple of \\"quiet\\" evenings reading.  I hated to see the story end.  Check this one out for a rewarding read!	2002-07-10

Here are nine classic Greek Mythical tales that have been restored and retold exposing for the first time the love between men in early times.  Only these are no ordinary men but the Greek Gods and heroes we thought we all knew.  Though I'm not an historian or scholar with a gifted knowledge of Greek Myths or legends, I found this book to be fascinating, exciting, and informative, as well as easy to read.  It's a fine collection of male love stories from the early writings of Greek Myths.  This is a beautifully designed book, from it's cover to it's dust jacket.  It's enhanced with black and white photos included in each chapter, displaying appropriately related classical Greek sculpture and art. <br />Andrew Calimach says he has carefully restored these stories from the primary sources, completing the missing myths from scattered fragments.  Whatever research was required to honestly restore these Greek Myths, we are the fortunate ones for these tales are lovingly translated.  There's the tale of Hercules and Hylas; a classic coming of age tale; Achilles and Patroclus, a tale of deep love between two courageous warriors, and my favorite Narcissus, a handsome youth who spurns the love of another... These are just three of the touching tales that Calimach has brought to light in this fine collection. <br />This is a book that the specialist, academic, or ordinary reader can enjoy.  These  are fascinating legends with a different focus centering on male love that will keep you reading way past the midnight hour.  Hopefully, Andrew Calimach will do more research and bring us more LOVERS' LEGENDS.  Truly Captivating!  <br />Joe Hanssen	2002-07-10

It is for these reasons that I was very sympathetic, understanding, and emotionally drawn to the people in this story.  William Hart has written a short, but powerful  story that packs quite a punch.<BR>  <br />It's a solid and touching story of the relationship between a teacher and his student, that could become romantic but does not quite reach that point.  It's 1985, and a Vietnamese student, Tina Le, has signed up for an English Secondary Language (ESL) course at a Los Angeles college.  John Goddard is her writing teacher and a Vietnam Vet, who is still experiencing flashbacks of the war.  The story is told in alternating journal entries, so that we are exposed to the  views of both characters daily lives.  This creates a very personal and intimate method of telling the story.  I think it brings us closer to the characters real feelings.  The story unfolds as the English Department decides to flunk out the many Asian Students.  Tina Le, a math major, has a talent for writing stories.  She writes a heartfelt story on the suffering of her family back in Vietnam during the war.  Goddard recognizes her literary talent and tries to reward her by having the story published.  Soon Goddard finds out the university administrator plans to fail the overabundance of ethnic minority students, including Tina Le.  Once Goddard finds out Tina Le has failed the course unfairly he strongly brings his objections to the university administrator, and soon finds himself fired from his job.  After filing a grievance, they are given a hearing, and what follows is a courtroom like drama, where both Tina Le, who testifies for Goddard, and Goddard fight to save his job.  During this time, Tina Le's and Goddard's relationship deepens, to the point where it could become romantic.  Of course, this creates even more problems for both of them. <BR> <br />This is a short and easy read, and an impressive debutby a writer that is a force to be followed in the future.  I especially enjoyed and related to his Vietnam experiences and the emotional and caring feelings he had for his ethnic and Vietnamese students.  This is a book that's hard to put down, and a story that should touch almost any heart.  Highly Recommended!<br />Joe Hanssen	2002-06-18

You might even call it \\"high risk literature\\".  He is a born writer who writes with short, tight, tense sentences that keeps the reader glued to the story from the beginning to the end.  You can feel the emotions and feelings of each of his characters.  That's why I have read all of his novels.  The subject matter may not be appealing but Cooper is a daring, literary master with words.  Cooper's writing has often been compared to another literary artist, William Burroughs.<BR>  <br />Cooper's latest novel is about a high school student named Larry who is offered $500, by an older student, to kill a fellow student at his school and retrieve the guy's notebook.  It seems like a easy enough task for Larry to do, but many unexpected complications arise.  After the student is killed, Larry decides to read the notebook out of curiosity.  What it reveals is totally unexpected and shocking for Larry.  Larry's life is changed from this point on in the story.  Larry at the same time,  is also wrestling with his own sexuality and a sexual relationship with his younger brother.  These young characters seem to be in a permanent state of emotional upheaval.  There seems to be so much violence, stress and sexual abuse in their lives.  Everyday is a matter of life and death for these kids.  This story is not one that will uplift your spirits, and it's not for the easily shocked. <BR> <br />Shocking?  Yes.  Sexually tense and violent?  Yes.  It almost seems like a \\"teenage hell\\".  As I said, \\"The subject matter may not be appealing but Cooper  is a daring, literary master with words.  Be prepared!!!! Cooper's done it again.  Recommended.<br />Joe Hanssen	2002-06-18

In viewing impressionistic paintings, there is always that feeling of visual discovery when you back away from the landscape/portrait and realize the clarity that is taking place in front of your very eyes. The blurred becomes the beautiful image. Well, that's certainly true in this exciting book of instant photos David has taken of his subjects, people who are not celebrities but everyday men and women, whom he has asked to have some fun in front of his camera by jumping up and down, posing, and intimately touching their bodies. What you get as a result is not just a candid photo but an image that is almost like an impressionistic painting. It's simply beautiful and pleasing to the eye. These are bold images of excited models that demand your complete attention.<br />This is a very special book because it features a new style and type of photography of the male nude. There are over 50 pages of instant color photos in this book. There is a creative introduction by Arthur Tress that is quite interesting. This book is beautifully bound, and printed by Fotofactory Press, a company that David started back in 1990. As a avid collector of male nude photography books, I know that each and every book carefully selected and published by FotoFactory is of high quality, perfectly bound and printed on quality paper. Highly Recommended!  Be sure to check out these other FotoFactory Press male nude photography books; California Boys, The Wild Ones, Male of the Species, and the Anthology Series, Volume 1-4, featuring many different photographs of this genre.	2002-06-12

After reading Jim Grimsley's four other previous brilliant novels; WINTER BIRDS, DREAM BOY, COMFORT & JOY, and MY DROWNING; I was thrilled to hear his fifth novel, BOULEVARD, was out.  Here's a writer who can grab your attention by weaving a story that is so interesting it is impossible to put down.<BR> <br />This is the story of a naïve pretty, gay boy, Newell, who leaves his hometown of Pastel, Alabama for the big city, in this case, the French Quarter of New Orleans.  It's the late 70's, an era of sexual excesses, drugs, partying and discos.  This small town boy looses his innocence in short order.  He finds an apartment, gets  a job in a restaurant, gets fired right away for not putting out for the owner, and then by a stoke of luck, or is it, finds a new job working in a seedy adult bookstore.  Here he finds his niche, quickly improves the business for the owner, and transforms himself from a shy country boy to an experienced, handsome, gay Narcissus, who uses his new found sexual appeal to his full advantage.  Grimsley vividly develops all the other characters in the story, feeding our imaginations with many colorful characters.  There is; Miss Sophie, a wise ugly and old transsexual; Mark, Newell's new drugged out boyfriend; Jack, a sadist who preys on Newell; and Mac, the big fat, ugly manager of the adult bookstore.  And, of course, Louise, Newell's landlady, who's having an illegal affair with......well, you will find out.  She knows it is wrong and has a hard time putting an end to the affair.<br />The descriptions and details of the New Orleans French Quarter, which include the street life, the bars, the parties and the people, and the events that unfold, are laid out in beautiful, poetic detail.  I believe Jim Grimsley to be the true literary genius of the Southern gay fiction story.  Some readers may be offended by details of Newell's sexual liaisons, and erotic, darker side of his steamy affairs, but it is just a reflection of that era and what it was really like in late 70's.  This story is both frightening and titillating at the same time, with a real surprising twist.  Do Not Miss This One.  It will bring Grimsley many new fans.  Highly Recommended!!!  I look forward to reviewing his sixth novel.  <br />Joe Hanssen	2002-06-07

I was familiar with Eric's writing before having read and truly enjoyed his first book, THE BOY IN THE LAKE.  This story is an inspirational, and fascinating account of the journey of Eric Swanson through Eastern Tibet with a Tibetan Lama and several other American followers.  The trip was basically made for humanitarian reasons, to bring medical aid, and other supplies to schools and other groups in need in Tibet. <BR> <br />If you have ever had any interest in Buddhism or just dreamed of what it would be like to travel to Tibet, this book is magical, very informative, and an easy read.  I read it in one evening.  It's much more than a travel log, and written with the general reader in mind.  Any age group would benefit and enjoy this book.  The hardships and disenchantment that Eric and the others experienced on this journey seemed overwhelming at times.  Traveling from a country that has so much, to a country with so little, makes you appreciate what you do have so much more.  Eric even begins to ask himself  \\" Why am I a Buddhist\\"?  There is much questioning at times on his part, but very positive results do occur for him in \\"Seeing the Light\\".  We learn that Tibetan masters often refer to the individual self as a \\"Stream of Being\\", meaning that an enormous variety of conditions contribute to our life each and every moment we exist.  How true!  I think this sums up the true meaning of life itself.<BR>  <br />A very thought provoking, intelligent, and interesting book.  I certainly learned a great deal from Eric's reliving his spiritual journey for us.  It was easy to visualize, interpret, and compare his feelings with my own beliefs.  The author has succeeded in accomplishing what he set out to do by entertaining &amp; teaching us a little bit about Eastern Tibet and Buddhism.  The search for Spiritual solace can be complicated, and a long process, but certainly worth the effort.  Highly Recommended!<br />Joe Hanssen	2002-06-07

I was so anxious to see Paul Jasmin's long-awaited first book, having recently heard so much about this remarkable photographer.  Over the years, I have researched many photographers, but wasn't familiar with Paul's work at all.  Well, I now have another favorite photographer.  These are stunningly seductive, moody, romantic, and erotic images, to name only a few feelings that came to me while viewing this sampling of his work.  These images are taken from the 1950's right up to 2001.  A great selection that covers male and female nudes, portraits of friends, people of the entertainment & art world, fashion shoots and peaceful travel images.<BR>  <br />Jasmin states, \\"I still dream in the 1950's\\", well, lucky for us.  You get a feeling from these photographs that you don't get from the current photographers images, and that's a feeling of innocence.  A time when sex was more innocent and much more sensual.  A long time friend of Bruce Weber, you can see the influence in a few of these photos.  Paul Jasmin have appeared in many leading fashion magazines such as Arena, Vogue, W, and L'uomo Vogue.  There are three informative and touching essays by Sofia Coppola, Grazia D'Annunzio, and critic Nicolai Ouroussoff.  They help to highlight & explain Jasmin's life and career.  Arena Editions has again published another striking book on quality paper, that is handsomely designed.<BR>  <br />This is a rare opportunity to enjoy a photographer who exposes us to a time that is now lost, a time of innocence and youthful carefree ways.  I really enjoyed this collection of his images.  Highly Recommended!	2002-03-30

There's been so much hype about this author's remarkable writing.  I was deeply disappointed after reading this book.  I almost stopped reading, after the first few stories, but struggled on to the very end, hoping the stories would get better or at least more interesting.  Where is the emotion, feeling, and caring in these stories?  In fact, there is too much added detail, skipping around, and confusion in most of these stories.  The book's description states \\"full of deep feeling and stunningly beautiful language\\".  Where?  Did I miss something?  The longest \\"short\\" story \\"The Carnival Tradition\\" was totally confusing.  The title story and \\"Boys\\" were the two best stories in the entire collection.<br />I gave this collection three stars because of the title story and a couple of others I felt were good.  However, the rest were just a waste of my valuable reading time.  I hope to spare you the trouble and will NOT recommend this one.	2002-03-30

Robert Mapplethorpe was never afraid of revealing his true self and personal sexuality to the world.  He shocked many people with his \\"in your face\\" attitude.  He wanted the world to realize that we're all sexual beings who shouldn't be ashamed of our bodies or sexual desires.  Life is for living, and he lived it to the fullest.  There have been many books published about Mapplethorpe, but this volume is a very personal collection of his black and white Polaroid photographs he took of himself in the early 1970's.  They reveal the many moods of Mapplethorpe, whether he was being erotic, sexy, dark & sinister, or very innocent.  It's a valuable collection of photos that verge on the edge of excitement.  There are about 65 black & white self-portraits here.  Some are not as clear as others due to the technology of the period.<br /><br />There is a very informative essay by Richard Marshall which is an invaluable addition to this book.  A nicely produced book by Arena Editions, with quality paper, printing, and design.  Robert Mapplethorpe was a man who's personal beauty and good looks, only enhanced his talented life as one of our most famous photographers.  A handsome addition for anyone's collection.<br />Joe Hanssen	2002-03-27

A fascinating, informative, and valuable in depth study about the interactions between a sex worker (formerly called Hustler) and a client that establishes the rules & requirements necessary to become \\"virtual boyfriends\\", and the positive results you can expect from this different sort of boyfriend relationship.  This book is an indispensable aid for anyone seeking the services of a sex worker.  Additionally, it is a valuable resource for sex workers who want to have a more meaningful and closer relationship with their clients.  Joseph Itiel has amassed over four decades of experience with sex workers, and he relates his mostly positive experiences with a refreshing openness & honesty.  Joseph believes meaningful relationships between a sex worker and client can be possible with considerable effort and that love need not be involved in the relationship.  The personal stories he tells of his own and others' experiences with many sex workers are truly captivating reading.<BR>  <br />In Chapter Two he explains the differences between hiring someone from an agency and on the internet, and the advantages & disadvantages of advance bookings.  Chapter Six deals with sex plus relationships and how the relationship between client and sex worker can be more than an exchange of money for sex.  It can be an intellectual pursuit, a spiritual practice, and a time of shared social activities.  It may even become a nonsexual friendship beneficial to both parties.  I thought Chapter 13 was extremely useful and important with it's seven guidelines to make the working relationship with a sex worker a more friendly, emotional and positive experience.  All of the chapters are filled with constructive information that you can use.  This book is complete with an appendix of sex worker's web sites to help you get started.<br />I guarantee you will not be able to put this book down once you start it, so plan ahead and keep a few hours open.  This book is perfect for anyone considering a virtual relationship with a sex worker or as a helpful guide for an experienced client.  Be sure and read Joseph Itiel's first book  \\"A Consumer's Guide to Male Hustlers\\", another ground-breaking study and a primer for this book.  Either book can be read independently, but make sure you read both for the complete picture.  Highly recommended!	2002-03-27

I found words hard to come by when reviewing and describing Greg Gorman's last all male nude photography book called AS I SEE IT.  Now he presents us with a new book of male nude photography starring \\"Greg Knudson\\" continuing his personal obsession with the male nude.  Again, I'm at a loss for words.  There are so many words I could use to describe this new body of work of his; sexy, erotic, stunning, glamorous, bold, and perhaps pornographic.  It's the first time that the exquisite art of photography Gorman is so well-known for (perfect lighting, flawless posing, excellent composition) has been combined to reveal the very intimate and very personal essence of one male model.  It's unmatched for its raw sexuality & beauty.<BR>  <br />There are over 250 photographs of Greg Knudson that were taken all over the world, from California, to Italy, to Germany, and France over a period of one year.  These are scenic & delightful images that evolved between the artist and his subject.  Only a mutual trust and admiration could permit such intimate and revealing photos.  There are many striking photos of Greg fully clothed and looking like a fashion model, but the ones that will bring a gasp, and a definite second glance by most viewers, will be the many fully aroused shots of this well-endowed model.  Greg has a very slight muscular body that is adorned with many tattoos.  He has the look, the attitude, the sexiness, and beauty to have a book entirely devoted to just him.<BR>  <br />I think both men and women of all ages will truly enjoy this new book.  There may be comparisons to other photographers' books on this one, but make no mistake about it, this is a FIRST in male nude photography from a world renowned photographer.  This has got to be the boldest compilation of images presented by any photographer today, who has the reputation of being one of the most sought after and admired  photographers of our time.  A masterful achievement of sexuality and art.  As with his previous book AS I SEE IT, I wish I could give this one more than five stars.  This attractively produced book, from it's green cloth cover, to it's flawlessly reproduced black and white photographs, make it a must for any collector's library.  This is a book not to be missed!  Highest Recommendation!<BR>  <br />...	2002-03-27

It's all a matter of personal taste whether you like this book or not.  It's all in what you believe a book of male nudes should be.  Do you believe a book of male nudes should be a fantasy of perfection & beauty or stark naked ugliness in all of it's day to day reality?  We all create our own fantasies and I think in this day and age we are looking for handsome, muscular or at least in good shape male nude models to gaze upon.  This is clearly evident in the increased sales of the many popular male nude photographer's books, for example: Bruce Weber, Herb Ritts, Steven Underhill, Adam Raphael, and so many more.  They strive to show us all what we desire and possibly wish for. <BR> <br />That being said, this book is beautifully produced, well-designed, and the photography of Rankin is very creative in regards to lighting, shadows, and clarity.  It's the subject matter that is just not appealing in most of these photos.  This photo presentation was an attempt to challenge one of the last remaining social taboos: the male nude.  Well, I think we are well beyond that now, and it's been accomplished, as I mentioned by all these other male nude photographers.  Ads were placed in Time Out and Dazed & Confused magazines for male nude models and it produced over 150 responses.  So you're going to find a variety of shapes, sizes, looks, and body types in this book.<BR>  <br />If you're looking for excellent photography you may enjoy this book.  However, if you looking for another male nude book of images of young, handsome muscular looking models, this is not for you.  I believe there's a humorous side to this type of book, but I don't think it's the male nude photography we've all become accustomed to enjoying and appreciating.  You've been forewarned!  Proceed with Caution!!	2002-03-24

It's right up there on my Top10 list.  This may be because I'm of Swedish heritage, but I know that's not the real reason.  The real reason is that this is an absolutely breathtaking photo album of erotic young-looking men photographed outdoors in the stunning landscape that is Sweden.  These photographs take advantage of the natural soft light, course landscape, and bright sunlight that is part of the changing seasons in Sweden.  It's amazing how well the models managed to stay relaxed, sensual & erotic looking during this cold & snowy winter photo shoot.  It's very unusual to take images of nude male models under such harsh conditions and have the models still look erotic, sensual and happy at the same time.  The sensuality, erotic mood, and sex appeal of each model does come across on each page of these black & white and color photographs.  I think this photo album is as great as it is because of Benno Thoma and all of his handsome young models who made it possible through their positive interaction together.  The scenic landscape & natural lighting  were an added bonus.<BR>  <br />Benno Thoma has worked in fashion and advertising photography for many years, and now is also well-known for his male nude photography.  He has several male nude photography books to his credit including: \\"Young Companions\\" (1995), \\"Edition Euros #3\\", and \\"Somos Cubanos\\" (1998).   These other photo books are awesome and true to his very creative and different style of photography, but I believe \\"Absolute Sweden\\" is my still my favorite.  This is definitely a collector's item for your library, so make sure you get it before it's too late.  I look forward to his next collection.  Highly Recommended!	2002-03-23

These photos were taken on a beautiful day at the beach.  What beach, I don't know, but I assume it's in Germany, however, I may be wrong.  The young men in this collection are good-looking and in great shape.  You can tell they had a lot of fun posing for Michael Reh in all of these black & white images.  This is another collection published by Bruno Gmunder, who has done a wonderful job in showcasing the current male nude photographers.  On a cold winter's day these photos certainly make you want to be on the beach hanging out with these guys in the warm sun.  Michael Reh started his photography career in 1998 photographing many celebrities & fashion models.  This book brought a smile to my face, and I look forward to Michael's future work.

If you're familiar with the men in Kristen Bjorn's all-male sexual videos you know what to expect from this book.  These still photographs are beautifully reproduced showcasing the very best muscular, handsome, and well-endowed men of Kristen Bjorn productions.  Most of these men are from Brazil and Latin America.  A beautifully produced hardcover book from Bruno Gmunder publications.  There is a short biography about \\"The Bear\\", and 104 pages of hot images that are meant to excite & they do.  This book should be in everyone's all male-nude collection.

I have to admit I've been a fan of David Leavitt's writing for some time, and I've read almost everything he has ever published.  I had my doubts about his handling nine short stories, but after repeated reminders by my friends who loved this book that I should read it, I finally sat down and read the book right through in one evening.  I wasn't disappointed in the least.  Here is a book of short stories that are timeless, that I believe will be long remembered and become classics.  David is truly experimenting with different forms of writing and styles here, and he is very successful....<br />Although all of the nine stories are exceptionally good, the three that stand out for me, and I believe the majority of readers, are definitely, \\"The Infection Scene\\", \\"Black Box, and the title story, \\"The Marble Quilt\\".  \\"The Infection Scene\\" parallels the past and present of two different lives.  It deals with the life of Lord Alfred Douglas, during and after his affair with Oscar Wilde, and the life of a fictitious young man named Christopher, who has an obsession with getting AIDS by having unprotected ...[realations] with his lover named Anthony, who is HIV- positive.  It shows how restraint & doing the safe thing is just too hard for some people to cope with.  It has the power, in this case, to make Christopher do a deadly thing, and not care about the end results.  \\"The Black Box\\" deals with the death of Bob Bookman's lover...  And \\"The Marble Quilt\\" tells the story of Vincent, who's ex-lover Tom, is found murdered in his apartment in Rome.  Each story deals with death in a different way, and it's the intriguing results that affects the remaining partners' lives that make these stories so realistic and enjoyable.<br />These stories may sound depressing to read, but they're not.  They are as much about living as they are about dying.  You'll find yourself asking, \\"What would I do in the same situations\\".  I'm still thinking about it myself.  This is one of David Leavitt's best books yet.  It's for sure, we can look forward to more brilliant writing like this from this wonderful author.  Highly Recommended!	2002-03-21

Lalli's latest collection of male nude images, I think, are among his best.  These guys are young, sexy, muscular and very well-defined.  You'll find no body fat here.  Most of his models are very good-looking with just a few exceptions.  This is a small book with mostly colored shots and a few black & white images.  It's about the same size as his other book \\"Sex Machine: Euros 17\\".  In fact, some of the same models from \\"Sex Machine\\" are included in this new book in new poses.  There are a few nude frontals but most are shown posing in briefs.  The lighting, the mood, and the serious look of the models gives this whole book a lurid feel, quite sexy and pornographic.<BR>  <br />Lalli has a way of getting across in his male images a feeling of extreme sexiness, that I don't think any other photographer has been able to accomplish like he has.  This book is not as edgy or dramatic as his first book, Fun ? Game: Male Models After Dark , but that's all right.  What we have with \\"Sex Machine\\" and \\"Kool Dudes\\" is just as sexy, a little less edgy, but stunning in it's presentation of what a creative photographer can do when challenged with photographing young men in the prime of their life.  Quite an accomplishment.  Recommended!	2002-01-24

This is an interesting and fascinating memoir of one man's life who happens to love sailing and who is also a gay man living in a caring and loving relationship.  You don't have to have a knowledge of sailing to enjoy this book.  Although I have gone sailing a few times, I wasn't familiar with a lot of the sailing terms, but the author explains them very well.  The author writes with dry wit, a questioning self-analysis, and deep passion.  It was a pleasure to read his story, and it was never boring.  This is a true-life story that will have broad appeal to many people. <BR> <br />Storandt tells in vivid detail the story of his transatlantic sailing adventure from Saybrook, Connecticut to Ireland, then on to Scotland aboard his 33-foot cutter named Clarity.  He made this journey with his longtime partner Brian, and their friend Bob.  It's an adventure that turns out to be exciting, unpredictable, and even life-threatening.  They certainly get to test their sailing skills through rough seas, gale force winds, and a fierce storm.  It's not \\"The Perfect Storm\\", but it's close.  Interwoven throughout his sailing adventure we learn all about Storandt's earlier life; his marriage, being a freelance musician, living in the Vermont woods in a geodesic dome, leaving his marriage, coming out, and meeting his soon to be life partner, Brian, a Scottish doctor. <BR> <br />So whether you're hooked on sailing or just want to read a well-written passionate coming out story, this book is for you.  I was disappointed when this adventure ended.  As good a writer as he is a sailor, Storandt tells a wonderful story I couldn't put down till finished.	2001-12-14

After reading this book I thought of many books I too have lost and misplaced from my earlier years of reading, and wished I had kept, or perhaps not given away.  It would be nice to be able to re-read them again, if only they were still in print.<br />This is a wonderful collection of almost 75 essays, by some of the world's best writers brought together by the editors of Brick: A Literary Journal, that are thoughtful, funny, interesting, witty, and heartwarming.  There is such a diverse selection of writers here that there are bound to be several essays for everyone to enjoy.<BR>  <br />Jim Moore's essay on \\"The Salt Ecstasies\\" by James White who died in 1981 was very inspiring.  Jim's poetry is very familiar to me for this was one of the first gay books of poetry I read while coming out.  Luckily I still have a first edition copy of this book.  Reading this essay inspired me to re-read Jim's poetry once again, and experience the passion &amp; love that he visualized in his poetry for so many of us.  Colm Toibin's essay on \\"Forbidden Territory\\" by Juan Goytisolo, who was an acquaintance of Jean Genet in Paris in the 1950's, is a tribute to this wonderful Spanish writer.  Colm is a fascinating Irish writer himself who has written two wonderful books, \\" The Heather Blazing\\" and \\"The Blackwater Lightship\\" (See my earlier reviews).<br />Please don't miss Javier Marias' Afterword.  This is writing at its best; intelligent, informative, funny, and touching.  The telling of his experience in a bookshop in England, and how the owner was such a fanatical collector that he had a hard time parting with &amp; selling his books is unforgettable.  If you love and cherish great books like I do, don't miss this collection of essays.  There's something for everyone here.  Only one inquiry from me, why isn't this book in hardcover for our collections.  Highly recommended!!	2001-11-24

Don't let it happen to you.  If you're an avid book reader, like myself, you know you'll find maybe one book out of ten that really is special, and this book has got to be one of my favorite so far this year.  It's beautifully written and a pleasure to read.  John Searles is a real wordsmith.  I was familiar with Searles writing from other publications, like Out, and other magazines, so I was very excited when he new debut novel was published.  I wasn't disappointed.  Here is a story that will keep you up at night till you're on the last page.<BR>  <br />The story takes place in 1971.  It tells the story of Dominick Pindle, a fifteen-year- old boy, who lives in Holedo, Massachusetts with his parents, who seem like a normal couple but really hold a lot of personal secrets.  Dominick's father tends to drink a lot.  Often Dominick and his mother must find him and drag him out of bars.  His father has a mistress named Edie, who Dominick meets one night while searching for his father, and Dominick himself begins an affair with her.  Dominick ends of loaning her lots of money that belongs to his mother, causing even more problems.  Dominick finds out his mother was saving the money for an abortion of her own.  She was having an affair, too, with Town Sheriff Roget.  Dominick's mother not being able to afford a safe illegal abortion ends of bleeding to death in a motel room trying to terminate the pregnancy herself, with someone else's help.  Who helps her, then deserts her is a real surprise.  It turns out that Edie, the father's mistress, is pregnant, too, and the baby belongs to Dominick's father.  There are so many plot twists in this story it's more than enough to fill two books.  As the plot moves along very rapidly with more and more twists, we find Dominick with his new girlfriend, Jeanny, holed up in the same motel room his mother died in, with Edie's baby, who is Dominick's sister. There theyare surrounded by the police, in a stand-off, that continues with more plot twists till the book comes to it's powerful conclusion.  What a story!<br />Once in a while you find a new author that's really exciting and a powerful writer.  John Searles is just that and more.  I've got a strong feeling this will become a movie someday soon.  I certainly look forward to reading and reviewing John's next book.  Bravo!	2001-10-19

This is a page turner that's hard to put down, from the brutal beginning to the shocking ending that will leave any reader stunned.  It's about 17-year-old Jip, who the night before he plans on telling his parents he's gay, goes to a public toilet and becomes a victim of gay bashing.  He suffers a fractured skull, emerges from a coma, brain damaged and can't remember anything of what has happened or who did this terrible deed to him.  Now he must learn the simplest of tasks over and over again.  He isn't able to remember people he already knows from day to day, so he writes everything down on a board to remember.  Therapy doesn't help him, so he meets Kasper who befriends him and suggests he take Karate lessons.  Kasper takes Jip to live with him &amp; help rehabilitate him.  Jip's parents are frustrated with Jip, and decide Kasper may be their only hope now to help their son.  The karate lessons are a failure so Kasper suggests weight training.  Jip meets closet case bodybuilder Axl at the gym who will be his weight lifting trainer.  Axl's new dependence on steroids becomes very destructive, and it slowly overwhelms him, changing his personality completely.  Jip and Axl's friendship turns into a sexual relationship, which causes many problems, especially with Kasper.  It's at this point the story, as told by the narrator (who is a neighbor &amp; a gay ballet dancer), accelerates quickly bringing this book to it's shocking conclusion.<BR>  <br />Although this story was about a very serious and horrible turn of events it was never depressing.  Yes, it's brutal and tragic, but the narrator keeps it's light in a black comic sort of way.  Believe it or not it's very humorous at times.  There's a lot of irony here, and catchy story telling.  A perfect book, a quick read, and a good way to spend an evening curled up by the fire in your favorite chair.  I recommend you don't miss this one!	2001-10-18

Alair later constructed these photographs in carefully selected sequences according to a rhythm and a visual music.  It certainly worked!  There are many tri-folds, and fold out pages in this book to show the images in these various sequences.  The book includes his own detailed essay about his work, and many essays by other professionals describing Alairs photographic style and his collection of images.<BR>  <br />This book is a great opportunity for anyone to learn about this wonderful photographer.  Alair Gomes died at the age of 71 when he was murdered in Rio de Janeiro.  This book was put out by the Foundation Cartier in Paris as an exhibition catalogue.  A great presentation it is.  Viewing these photographs he took secretly of these young men makes one feel like a voyeur, like he was.  This is a beautiful book for your collection or to give as a gift.	2001-10-18

They are all in traditional poses with some showing just a touch of fetishism, such as leather codpieces, gas masks, ropes, and other material encasing their erect penises.  You'll find most are photographed in outdoor settings.  Many of the models are muscular &amp; very handsome.  I especially liked \\"Billy\\" 1997 &amp; \\"Faun\\" 1992.   Props are used in a very sexy and erotic way.  There's lots of eye contact with the camera by the models.  You get the feeling they are obsessed with their bodies and really want to be admired for their beauty.<br />This was my first exposure to Fehl Cannon, a photographer that was unknown to be before this small, but impressive book was published.  Born in Georgia, he now lives and works in Washington, D.C.  A lot of his models are from Latin America.  A wonderful collection of male nude images that I surely enjoyed.  I hope a larger collection of his prints are forthcoming in the near future.  I look forward to it.	2001-10-18

Zubro's mysteries are never disappointing, and this one certainly is one of his best.  I couldn't rip through the pages fast enough.  Although I felt some of the weak jokes and forced banter that went on between Detectives Buck Fenwick and Paul Turner went on too long and became tiring after a while.  However, that's my only complaint.  The story is very interesting, exciting and fast paced.<br />Detectives Paul Turner and Buck Fenwick are assigned the murder case of Craig Lenzati and Brooks Werberg, two software geniuses and business partners who both have been stabbed to death within the last 24 hours.  Craig happens to be straight and Brooks is a gay man.   As the detectives soon find out both of these victims have been playing sex games with many people and keeping score of their many conquests.  The people they have been sexually abusing and blackmailing are very angry and anyone of them could be the potential murderer.  At the same time that the detectives are trying to solve the computer nerds murders someone is also killing cops while traveling across the country.  Chicago is next on the list.  Could the two cases be related?  Could it be the same killer.  In both the cop killings and the software executives murders the victims have been urinated on, and stabbed to death many times with a large jagged knife.  Perhaps even Turner &amp; Fenwick will be the next victims? <BR> <br />There's a lot of mystery here, and the story moves along at quite a fast pace.  It's a book you can't put down.  I have read all of Mark Zubro's books and I truly enjoyed this one.  It's a nice way to spend an enjoyable evening and an excellent  diversion.  Highly recommended.	2001-10-17

LeRoy's first book, \\"Sarah\\", I said, \\"he would have to go a long way to top this debut novel when he writes his next book.\\"  Well, J.T. you've certainly came through with another gripping, heart-wrenching masterpiece.  If these 10 autobiographical stories don't get to you, and make you want to help every abused child you can, than you have no heart or feeling.  All of these loosely connected stories tell of such horrible abuse he suffered while growing up, it's just too hard to imagine his pain.  It's really hard to get through this book, but you just can't stop reading it because you get this helpless feeling inside knowing that no child should ever have to suffer like he did. <BR> <br />The book is so beautifully written, it's hard to believe J.T. has only been writing for such a short time.  It's very mature, lyrical writing for a writer so young.  This story is like a bad nightmare you can't wake up from, it's that shocking.   All of the sexual abuse, torment, suffering, and cruelty from his mother should have never happened.  This is a book you'll never forget!  One good thing that came out of all of this, we now have one of the most promising new writers to look forward to in the future.  Don't miss this one!	2001-10-17

There's a lot of coming-of-age stories being written today but many of them are not told in a very positive light.  Most are told in a negative way with suffering, lost of friends &amp; family, and rejection by peers.  The young gay person finds himself usually moving to the big city, where he can find acceptance with other urban gay men.  He no longer feels wanted in his small hometown.  I was excited about Jay Quinn's debut novel because it tells the story of a young man, Matt, discovery he is gay and being accepted in an intelligent &amp; positive way by the people who have always loved him before his coming out.  More and more young people today are discovering their sexually at a younger age than ever before.  It would be nice if all young people could be accepted like Matt is in this story.<br />Matt, the story's narrator, is an 18 year old from a small town by the coast in North Carolina.  He's just graduated from High School and is not too sure what he's going to make of his life yet.  So he goes to live with his gay Uncle Tiger and his lover, Mark, a pilot, at their house by the shore.  He plans to work for Uncle Tiger's surveying business for a year and earn some money for his college education.  Mark's son, Shane, who is straight, also lives with them.  Matt finds total acceptance in his new all male family.  He learns how to surf &amp; finds great pleasure in his new sport.  He goes to his first gay bar and has his first sexual experiences.  All of his sexual experiences are written in a beautiful, exciting, loving &amp; intensely erotic way.<BR>  <br />If you're not from the South it may take a little while to get use to some of the Southern manners of speech.  I believe this makes the story more authentic and totally realistic.  It's great to read a book from a Southern gay perspective for a change.  I think Jay Quinn with this debut novel, \\"Metes and Bounds\\" has proven himself to be one of the best new talented &amp; engaging writers out there today.I certainly enjoyed his other two books, \\"The Mentor\\", a memoir and \\"Rebel Yell\\", a collection of stories by various Southern authors.  I eagerly await his future endeavors.  Make sure this book is on the top of your \\"To be Read list.\\"  A truly enjoyable read!	2001-10-17

The reason I was so impressed with these vintage photos of strongman and those aspiring to be strongman is that a lot of these classic photos have not been seen before.  This is a fascinating selection of rare cabinet cards and studio portraits by some of the most famous photographers of that time period.  You have your Herculean types such as Tony Sansone (my all time favorite), Eugene Sandow, Jack Lalanne, and many others.  But what's really fascinating is all the amateur photos &amp; snapshots of anonymous muscular young men that Robert has brought together for us in his book.<BR>  <br />There is a very personal foreword by Jules Bacon, Mr. America 1943, who was one of the most handsome &amp; muscular young men of his time.  The introduction by Robert Mainardi is a fascinating account of why he started collecting &amp; how his obsession began as a young man.<BR>  <br />Any collector of physique photography should not miss having this volume in their collection.  It's a must.  Council Oak Books has done a beautiful job in printing this book, from the design of the book to the clear photo reproductions.  If you like this book be sure and buy Council Oak Books first vintage photo book called \\"Sailor.\\"  Another beautiful book for your enjoyment and collection.  Both are highly recommended.	2001-10-04

I can see why, it certainly couldnt be a more beautifully written, compassionate, and captivating work.  I got really involved with this story and all the characters Patrick has created for us. <BR> <br />For his 40th birthday Wills sister, Poppy, gives him a two week vacation at a cottage on the seashore of Cornwall as a gift.  Will is unaware that this is the same cottage that he and his parents stayed at thirty-two years ago.  Will decides to take his parents on vacation with him.  Will is single, uninvolved, and gay.  Wills brother in-law, Sandy, decides to come along, too.  This complicates things as Will is having an affair with Sandy who is Poppys husband.  We are presented with the makeup and human drama surrounding this family,  as the chapter settings alternate between current events, and what happened thirty-two years ago.<br />Throughout this story there is such an aura of mystery involving all the family members and relatives that its hard to stop reading this book.  I couldnt wait to see what happens next.  When I first starting reading this story I had a lot of questions, and it did seem a bit confusing, but by the end of the book, I felt I had most of the questions answered.  However, thinking about it again, I find I still have unanswered questions.  If a book makes you think about it long after youve read it, I believe the author has achieved his goal.  Patrick Gale certainly captured my attention and has made a lasting impression on me.  This is a wonderful novel of family, love, sadness, regret, and even hope.  I hope we hear a lot more from this wonderful British author.  Recommended!	2001-10-04

I hate to say this is like most contemporary gay fiction being written today, but it is. This isn&#8217;t a bad thing, in fact, it&#8217;s great that fiction can center more on our own families, as well as our nuclear families, and just talk about everyday life, its problems, and events common to most of us, whether we are gay or straight. This is an interesting read, a very quick read, and a pleasant way to spend a few hours. The story centers around Clu, a man who&#8217;s in his 30&#8217;s, and his return home to a small town in Texas, called Grit. He returns home with his psychic lover of eight years to help his mother, who&#8217;s sick with cancer, thru the last days of her life. The story goes off in many directions,but the theme is whether a man from the big city, of course, Manhattan, can really go home and find peace & happiness in his old home town. Will he & his partner, Chris, be accepted back home by friends and relatives now that he is openly gay? Clu relationship with his partner also gets tested when a blond, muscle hunk named Preston enters the picture. Anyway, you get the picture here. A light, easy read, but a book that has some muscle to it, and one that proved to be interesting enough for me to really enjoy it. I especially related to his loving and very caring feelings toward his mother, and how much they bonded near the end. I was touched by Jack Sibley&#8217;s sensitive writing of this very special time that Clu spent with his mother. I experienced the same feelings when my own mother had cancer. A touching story, and one I definitely recommend!!	2001-09-11

This is not a book on how to bring up a companion parrot for the first time parrot parent. Some of the interaction between Tiko and Joanna goes against all behavioral advice that has been published before by behavioral parrot experts, and my own experience with companion parrots. You'll have to remember Joanna is doing scientific study and trying to let Tiko live as wild &amp; free as possible within an enclosed household environment. Some of the things that Tiko is allowed to do could prove very fatal to a companion parrot. A companion parrot needs kind &amp; loving discipline, and they do look to us as their parents in captivity for daily guidance and direction. If they don't have this, they end up very frustrated and confused, and stressed.<br />That being said, this is a wonderful story of the interaction and love between Tiko and Joanna. The experiences that Joanna had while on her many jungle trips to South America, etc, are captivating reading. I would love to read a detailed account of these scientific findings she experienced on these trips. This was a touching story, and I'm glad Dr. Burger shared it with us.

Even if you never plan to use the services of a male hustler/model/masseur/escort, and are just curious like I was, this book is a joy to read, and full of fascinating information. Author Joseph Itiel really knows about hustlers. He describes his dealings with hustlers over a period of 35 years from all over the world. I couldn't put this book down. It's full of information that will make you well-informed about finding a hustler, figuring out how much to pay them, and making sure it's an experience that is safe and pleasurable to both parties. In this way you'll enjoy the experience and be in control of the situation at all times. I was delighted to find that someone has finally written an honest, intelligent, well-researched book about this subject. It's the author's experiences that he relates so honestly in this book that to me made it a real page turner. Some were funny, amusing, and others hard to believe, though true. The authors' goal with this book is to make us well informed about the hustling experience and I think he has succeeded. He even feels meeting with a hustler regularly can be more satisfying and mutually beneficial than having a steady relationship that can become boring. It's great that he decided to share this part of his life with us. Highly recommended! Another great gay studies book from Harrington Park Press.	2001-09-11

It could be Manhattan, San Francisco, Boston, or any other major city, but this story takes place in Toronto.  This story filled with true-to-life characters makes us remember our own experiences when we were in our early 20s struggling and striving to find a place in this world, and wandering where it was going to lead us.  Michael Draper dreams of becoming a famous screenwriter.  Will he succeed when a wealthy filmmaker, Carmen Denver, offers him a major screenwriting job?  Ingrid Iversen, who manages a coffee shop, is a very talented painter, who wants to remain unknown, until she meets the wealthy gallery owner who may make her the Talk of the Town, and new artist of the year.  And is there also romance in this relationship for her?  Ramir Martinez is frustrated with his acting career, but may get a chance to finally present his one man show called Eruption at last.  Ramir is the gay guy of everyones dreams, a man who has no trouble getting dates, and has a hard time keeping track of his latest conquests.  These three friends, who are young, innocent, and out to become the next Big Thing are presented to us in this fast pace book that is a joy to read and really hard to put down.  <br />All of the events in their three lives leads to a turn for the worse in Mitchells life in this engaging story, and could even lead to a murder mystery being solved. Theres a lot of twists and turns in this story that will guarantee you never get bored for even a minute reading this book.  I found this book to be an entertaining and fun way to spend a few hours.  I highly recommend this book.  A great first novel by Warren Dunford!	2001-09-11

It takes place in Amsterdam, Holland in 1939 when two young oarsmen train under the guidance of an eccentric German coach in hopes of someday winning the Olympics.  Anton, who narrates the story, is from a working class family.  David, the other oarsmen in this two man boat with Anton, is an affluent &amp; self-assured athletic young man.  The story in beautifully worded images describes the two young men as they become bonded together closer and closer through grueling practice sessions and training to later go on to winning many local races.  Anton's description of his obsessive desire to please and do everything perfect  for David is almost like a love story and indeed very homoerotic at times.  This story is told five years later by Anton as he revisits the now abandoned boathouse.  You can tell he is deeply emotional in his remembrances of a time that he describes as \\"the best summer of his life.\\"  You get the feeling this is the most important year of his whole life, too.  With World War II now exploding all around him as he remembers, you can feel his tragic lost of youth and happier times.  <br />I felt this was a sensitive and well-written work of literature.  There is so much feeling in Brink's writing about this friendship and the time they shared together.  I sincerely hope to read more from this Dutch writer in the near future.  Highly Recommended!	2001-08-01

This fourth novel of Paul Reidinger is a return to the style of writing that he used  in his first novel, THE BEST MAN, back in 1986.  Even Ross Whitmore &amp; David Rice make a welcome return in this story.  Beautifully written, this novel is sexy, intelligent and told from the heart.  Its the story of a gay man in his forties named Guy, and a sixteen- year- old boy, Doug, and the relationship that they develop when they meet one day at a beach in San Francisco unexpectedly.  Both of there lives are changed for better or worse by this event.  This is not a story of sex between a younger man and an older man.  Its not a book of pornographic fantasy, but a coming of age story about a young man who is angry, confused, and just discovering sex.  He is desperately seeking &amp; reaching out for help from a father figure that he can trust, love and talk to about his feelings.  It becomes a wise story of mentoring.  And Guy is the perfect person for Doug to look up to.  He is as decent &amp; kind as one could ever wish &amp; hope for.  This is an intelligent and wise handling of the interaction between a man and boy, that can be a little erotic at times.  Theres a lot of twists in this story that will keep you turning the pages as fast as you can.  Dougs father, Ross, and the bad situation he creates for himself, and the effect it has on Doug and his mother, is a complete surprise.  At the time Doug needs his real father the most hes not there for him.<br />I really enjoyed this new novel by Reidinger.  Reidingers reflections on life, sex, and love, are much more advanced than other novelists, even, the ending was very unexpected, and could only come from a clever novelist like him.  Its touching, wise, sexy, and heartbreaking at the same time.  I hope there is a continuation of the story in the future.  Highly recommended!  If you enjoy this book be sure to check out another wonderful book about mentoring by Jay Quinn called THE MENTOR.This is a great memoir about friendship and gay identity.	2001-07-28

Sandra has a lot to say, and where she gets all this information &amp; ideas from, I don't know.  It's amazing!

Not being a critic, but just a lover of fine art, I found this long hidden selection of John Singer Sargent's male nudes fascinating, and beautiful produced.  There are drawings in black &amp; white and many in color in this fine selection.  This book was published on the occasion of Sargent's major retrospect that traveled to several major galleries in 1999.<br />Sargent began some of these drawings in his adolescence, and continued drawing male nudes throughout his career.  However, they were never exhibited or seen by many other people until now.  Some of the models became enduring friends with the artist, and remained by his side during his entire lifetime.  There is a wonderful introduction that is very helpful in understanding this very talented and creative artist.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that knows and enjoys Sargent's artistic work. For those of you who don't, this is a great introduction!	2001-07-25

I believe and I hope there's a sequel in the works, and I'm sure there's a movie in the future for this exciting story.  <br />The story centers around Dr. Marcus Gallagher who is trying to eliminate genetically inherited disease in the world.  Dr. Gallagher's goal is to create a more productive society by eliminating all the people with defective genes.  He has enlisted many great doctors &amp; scientists to work at his advanced cult-like lab facility on Bloodsworth Island in the Chesapeake Bay.  Dr. Gene Nolan is one such research physician who gives up his own identity and personal self to help Dr. Gallagher. However, he soon learns Dr. Gallagher has a plot to eliminate millions of people.  Should Gene turn against Dr. Gallagher who has always been there for him, or do the right thing before this gets out of control?  <br />You get the feeling of being a member of a cult from this story, or being brainwashed by a leader who has taken over the minds of the people.  It made me think of Hitler and Jim Jones and how they twisted the truth and managed to make so many people believe in them &amp; follow them.  I highly recommend this book to everyone who enjoys a suspenseful read.  I eagerly await Jeff &amp; David's next book!	2001-07-19

I was really excited about getting this new book by Mario Testino, one of my favorite photographers, but was truly disappointed when it arrived.  Yes, it's a very classy publication, and comes in a unique &amp; different pink slipcover,  but not being familiar with Visionaire's previous publications, I expected a paperback book of high quality, however, what I got was a magazine.  Yes, it is numbered in a limited edition of 6000 but it's not even signed by the photographer.  <br />Mario Testino is one of my favorite photographers who has previous published many wonderful books.  Mario's advertising campaigns are world-renowned.  There are a lot of great images in this magazine, but I would have been so much more satisfied if Mario had published a hardcover book of his \\"Man\\" images instead, and included an extensive selection of his work.  If you're a fan of Mario Testino's photography, have collected Visionaire issues before, and have a high-income budget, then you should add this to your collection.  I know I'd rather stick to \\"Mondo Uomo\\" or \\"L'uomo Hommes Vogue\\" myself!	2001-07-19

David Vance has outdone himself in his second book of photography called  \\"Attractions.\\"  I thought his first book \\"David Vance Photographs\\" was beautifully produced and the models breathtaking, but this new book of his is just as good or even better.  The new models presented in this second book are once again very young, muscular  &amp; handsome masculine men.  Most of these black &amp; white images are in outdoor settings showing the men practicing sports, enjoying themselves and just relaxing.  There are some models photographed indoors in very seductive poses, too,  but no frontal nudity images. It's really not needed for these guys are handsome &amp; erotic even semi-clothed.  This is surely one of my favorite books in my collection and I'm sure it's a book that will be viewed over and over many times.  Here's wishing David puts out another collection of his male nudes again in the very near future!	2001-07-19

Now in this edition called &#8220;Male Nudes&#8221; Taschen has published a much smaller version of the original book with the very best and most impressive images in a wonderful and very affordable paperback.  I was very impressed with this edition.  It&#8217;s a great introduction to the history of male nude photography from the 1850&#8217;s to the present day.  It&#8217;s a fascinating look at the changes the male nude has experienced in body type, structure, and sexual content over the past 100 years.  There are images from almost every photographer you can think of during this time period.  The quality & printing of this book is excellent.<br />This is a must for anyone who appreciates & admires the male body and wishes to know the history of male nude photography.  Make sure you get a copy of this before it&#8217;s too late.  Highly Recommended!	2001-07-19

In this first book of his, let's just say the models are breathtaking.  These young, handsome, masculine &amp; muscular men are shown in mostly outdoor shots while at work, at play and or just relaxing in very erotic bedroom poses.  These black &amp; white photos are beautifully photographed.  David Vance has had a very successful career photographing portraits of many celebrities, and in photographic advertisement for many publications.  I love his easy &amp; natural style of photographing his models.  They always seem so relaxed and unconscious of the camera.  There is no full frontal nudity.  This is a beautiful book that should be in any collection of male nude photography.  Be sure to check out his second book &quot;\\"Attractions\\", a welcome new edition by David Vance.	2001-07-17

These are shots of the many new models and porn stars currently showcasing in Falcon's videos.  Mick Hicks is one of California's most popular commercial male photographers and you can tell why when you get to view these great images of his.  These full frontal nudity photos display pure sex appeal.  <br />A beautifully designed book published by Bruno Gmunder.  There's a sense of power &amp; raw masculinity in these images that sets this photographer apart from the others.  \\"Two Snaps &amp; \\"Two Thumbs Up.\\"	2001-07-17

It's not too often (if this is not a first) that we get to hear about the southern rural experience in gay literature.  I'm a northern boy so it's interesting to learn how southern boys live and learn &amp; experience the world from their gay perspective.  Fascinating stories here, some very unusual in there depictions of horror as well as tenderness.  This is the southern heritage at its' finest.<br />I especially enjoyed \\"Pump Jockey\\" &amp; \\"465 Acres.\\"  These are not erotic stories, although some come close.  They are heartfelt confessions of what it is to be gay and from the south.  I enjoyed everyone of these stories, and hope Jay puts out another collection soon.  I look forward to his new unusual coming-of-age novel, \\"Metes and Bound.\\"   This book gets my recommendation, of course.	2001-07-08

Therefore, most of my reviews tend to be very positive.  Time is so limited one has to be very selective in what they read because there are so many wonderful books out there to be read yet!!<br />I was thrilled to finally get this book, but totally disappointed after reading it.  It written in easy, simple language, and I thought it would be a quick read.  I struggled to get through it, and finally did.  I almost gave up more than once.  It's a great story that just seems to wander all over the place.  Assistant DA Giobberti, from one of the most murderous precincts in Brooklyn, is given the case of Kayla, a young 14 year old girl found dead with a gunshot wound to the heart.  This case strikes home for Gio who recently lost his 5 year old daughter, Opal,  to an unfortunate accident which Gio feels was his fault.  He's lost interest in his job, drifts along aimlessly, mourning his daughter and his separation from his wife, Amanda.  The murder case is good fiction &amp; almost interesting, and could make this book worth reading, but is so dragged out that you want to scream by the end.  While we're waiting for the murder to be solved, we're left with endless chapters of his cruising various woman that he works with.  At times the story just drifts too far off course.<br />I had no feeling for anybody in this novel, and hope now to forget them all.  I'm sorry to say I didn't enjoy this book at all.  The END!	2001-07-08

I truly enjoyed all of Stephen McCauley other books, and certainly wasn't disappointed with this new one, \\"True Enough.\\"  I enjoyed this story from the very beginning to its surprise ending.  Stephen's books are always hard to put down, his likable characters are easy to become emotionally involved with, especially the ones in this story.  <br />Desmond &amp; Russell have been together five years now in a happy monogamous relationship living the good life in NYC.  Desmond has been working on his second book, a biography of a 60's pop singer named Pauline Anderson, and after 3 years  of writing it, he is almost finished.  Desmond decides  to take a temporary position at Danforth College in Boston, and be away from Russell for a while to see if he can find his own individuality again &amp; perhaps find time to discover the missing ingredient to finish his biography.  Will the separation deepen their relationship or cause problems they never expected to happen by being separated? Desmond meets Jane, a producer of a Boston PBS station while away, and they decide to collaborate on a documentary about forgotten pop singer Pauline Anderson.  This could boast Jane's career at the station &amp; perhaps help Desmond finally finish his book.   Together Jane &amp; Desmond help each other and eventually find the answers to each of their own personal problems.  It's what they endure and discover at this point that makes this such a satisfying read.  <br />No doubt about it, I love this author's writing.  He knows how to grab your attention, keep it there, and bring it all to a satisfying conclusion.  A very pleasant read.  I eagerly await his next selection!	2001-06-21

I wish I remembered nights in the barracks like these 16 true-life military stories relate.  Alex Buchman presents us with authentic accounts of sex in the Armed Forces.  These are stories the military doesn't want told.  There are no gay men in the military and there's no gay sex, they want us to believe.  They want us to think that young military men have no sexual desires.  Well, this book is a welcome relief.  Young military men do have sexual desires, and emotions, whether they straight or gay.  All of these gay sexual encounters by military men are hotter than any fiction put out because they are real-life accounts.  This isn't just an erotic, sexually explicit collection of stories, it's a thought-provoking history of real life while in the military.  <br />I enjoyed all of the 16 stories included in this collection.  I think Alex provided us with a great group of contributors for this book.  There's a brief biography of all the contributors in the back of the book, which is very helpful in knowing a little about each author.  There's a enlightening introduction by none other than Steve Zeeland, the author of several military sexual interview books that include \\"Barrack Buddies\\", \\"Sailors and Sexual Identity\\", and \\"The Masculine Marine.\\"  These stories will leave you eager for more.  I know I look forward to future editions by Buchman.  Another great volume of gay military stories &amp; studies put out by Harrington Park Press.  Be sure and check this book out, highly recommended!	2001-06-12

I give George a lot of credit for saying what's on his mind about everything, and I do mean everything.  He's not afraid of what people think.  He proves this in every book he writes, and in his stand-up comedy act.  Here's a man who's not afraid to be politically incorrect.   If you offended by four letter words (profanity), realistic religious evaluation, drugs, or humor about incompetent politicians stay away from this book.  If you're open-minded, intelligent, and not afraid to think for yourself, grab this book and enjoy an evening with George's thoughts.  This man is crazy, but in a wonderful way.  There's a lot of funny stuff in this book.  <br />I loved his section on \\"Your Children Are Overrated.\\"  I think he has the right answers.  \\"Don't Blame the Leaders\\" puts the blame where it belongs for the state of our current leaders, and that blame is totally on the people.  George has a lot of gripes, and whether you agree with them all is up to you as an individual.  I know one thing, he really makes you think, and at the same time makes you laugh at our human short comings.  <br />I think the world's a better place because of people who question life the way George does.  I enjoyed this book.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that I enjoyed his other book \\"Brain Droppings\\" by him even more.  Bravo, George, keep it coming, you're one of a kind in this world!!!!!	2001-06-12

What a refreshing change to read about another culture, especially life in contemporary China.  I learned a lot about the Chinese socialist form of living, and the different traditions and beliefs of their people.  It certainly makes me appreciate more the freedom &amp; wealth that we take for granted here in the United States.  The author uses a flat writing style of simple sentences that it takes a while to adjust to.  The stories do seem to end rather abruptly at times.  However, this is only a small complaint from me.  I stayed glued to the book until I finished it.  <br />My favorite story, of course, was the title story, \\"The Bridegroom.\\"  A model husband joins a secret men's literary club and is arrested for the crime of loving other men, homosexuality.  \\"The Woman From New York\\" was another favorite, about a Chinese woman who finds out things are just not the same in her hometown after an extended stay in New York.  She finds she is not welcome anymore in her former life.  <br />I think these stories held my attention and proved so interesting for the mere fact that it opened up a whole new world for me in understanding how other cultures think and rationalize everyday living.

Each little biography includes a picture of the favorite star, drag queen, singer, actor or performer.  I enjoyed several of his picks like k.d.lang, Divine, Grace Jones, Alain Delon, Madonna, etc.  I highly disagreed with his picks of Jeffrey Dahmer, Francis Farmer, Roger Moore, and Liberace.  Some of his picks are meant to be controversial, and they are.   This is just one of a series of books put out about 20th Century Icons.  Graham's royalties from this book go the Terrance Higgins Trust, the UK's leading HIV and AIDS Charity.  A good cause.  I found this book enjoyable, especially the gay icons that I personally chose.

Thad Carhart has written a book that should appeal to a broad spectrum of readers that includes musicians, piano lovers, novices and professionals alike.  Yes, even those who think a piano is just a piece of furniture will learn a lot, and probably be shamed into getting back to practicing once again.  If you already own a piano, wish to own one, or just want to know more about pianos &amp; their history  this book is an excellent source of information.  Did you know that \\"Fazioli\\" concert grand pianos costs well over one hundred thousand dollars, and that only sixty are made each year, and there are fewer than one thousand \\"Fazioli\\" pianos in existence, and each are essentially handmade?  This book is chuck full of information that is so interesting, especially about the 16th and 17th century pianos. There is also a lot of technical information about how piano's work, that explains everything about the instrument, strings, sounding board, etc.<br />Wait, I can't stop yet.  Not only is this book full of history and excellent information about pianos, there is a story, too.  Thad passes a little piano storefront in his Paris neighborhood each day while taking his two children to their school.  One day he decides to enter the shop to check it out, meets the grumpy owner &amp; is rebuffed, but eventually gets the right introduction, (you have to be referred by an established customer) and the shop then becomes a daily part of his life.  Here he learns from Luc, the atelier's master, the history and art of piano's.  Luc becomes a valuable friend.  He helps Thad find a piano for himself that he loves, a Stingl baby grand from Vienna.  In Thad's almost daily visits to the store's atelier he meets many interesting and charming people.  They all share their love of piano's, music, and life over a glass of wine.  It made me wish I was part of their group.  <br />The piano has always been my favoriteinstrument, and it has always fascinated me with it's beautiful sound.  Yes, I am one of those people who have become lax, and not devoted enough time to keeping up with my piano playing.  This book is certainly an inspiration to anyone who appreciates the piano.  A wonderful &amp; fascinating story, and detailed history of the piano.  Highly Recommended.	2001-06-04

These poems by Grady Harp and the beautiful vessels created by Stephen Freedman demonstrate a wonderful collaboration of two people trying to make sense of the death and destruction of so many lives during the Vietnam War.  I cried when I read these poems.  That's how touched I was.  Yes, I was there in 1968 during the Tet Offensive, and know first hand of the suffering that was experienced.  However, I can never feel the pain, the helplessness, and the great loss that Grady felt as a doctor in helping these young innocent men face great pain, and even death.  My heart goes out to him, and also to others who saved so many lives.  They should be very proud, especially Grady.

Again, he has created characters you feel you've known as friends, relatives, and acquaintances, just ordinary people coping with everyday life, and its many trials and tribulations.  There's sex, drugs, alcohol, extramarital affairs, &amp; coming of age peer pressures and problems.  You name it, it's here in this story.<br />This is the story of the Rubins family that seems to be falling apart.  I think the only character that really has it together is the grandfather, Max, who cherishes life, and meets the love of his life at 81 years old.  Anthony Rubin, the young son, is desperately trying to find love especially with his neighbor Juliette.  Jess, his mother seems to have so many psychological problems.  She knows her husband is having an affair with Claudia, and just takes off for Florida.  And there's Dani, the daughter.  Well, I'll leave you to discover her problems.  All these ordinary people seem to be wondering what to do next with their lives.  <br />Sometimes it helps to read about other people and their family problems.  It helps you forget your own.  I enjoyed this novel, and I really came to care about these people.  I look forward to the author's next book.  Oh, and I hope you find your true \\"b'shert\\" in your life, too!	2001-05-26

He is perhaps one of the most famous of the Bel Ami models, next to Johan Paulik.  It's not just his body and smile, but his beautiful eyes.  In this 11th Euros Series book of color photos, he is shown posing alone and with the many other Bel Ami models.  These are clear and beautiful images as only Bel Ami can produce.  This book is definitely a must for any male nude photography collection.  Highly Recommended!	2001-05-26

A person that doesn't get swayed by others negative traits.  That's why I took a special liking to Jacob Erickson, a shy, and sometimes naïve person, who is the main character in this wonderful little story that takes place in the 1920's.  One day he discovers he has the power to heal animals with his hands, and soon after finds out he can heal humans, too, when he heals Sharon, a girl he has fallen in love with.  He soon leaves his job on a ranch in California's Mojave Desert to pursue Sharon who has run off to be a singer in Los Angeles.  It's there that there adventure starts to take several unexpected turns from working for exploitative showmen, to seedy stage shows, and to healing an ailing young millionaire named Earl, who changes everything and leads them on a different course in their lives.<br />Jabob reminds me of myself years ago when I had the opportunity to heal but decided to choose a different path for my life which I found to be in my best interest.  It's a difficult choice and this story, told in the first person, makes it much more realistic.  As Jacob finds out you can only heal those who want to be healed.  The body can be healed but Jabob only wanted to heal the body if the soul &amp; heart are healed, too.  A wise choice.  I'm glad I discovered this book and truly enjoyed it.  Highly Recommended!	2001-05-17

These photographs were taken by Frank DiLeo between 1970 &amp; 1980, and as stated in the book, there's a cultural-historical feel to these dated images.  They remind me of Von Gloeden, but in black &amp; white.  These young long haired well-endowed, dark, Mediterranean type models he photographed are beautiful to look at.  They seem very happy posing for the camera, and most are smiling.  I think photographs from this period show much more sexual attitude &amp; emotion than current photographer's works.  Or maybe it's just that we have been more over-exposed over the last two decades to so many male nude photography books they have lost their spark of originality and excitement.<br />I like Frank's photography images &amp; enjoyed this collection.  My only complaint again, as in other Euros Series books, is that there is no real biography of this photographer, just a few words about his style.  We're left with a lot of questions about him &amp; his life's work.  Recommended.	2001-05-17

Pedro Usabiaga is a well known &amp; admired photographer of Europe who has published for many magazines, &amp; received many awards.  His previous book \\"Besame Mucho\\" was an international best-seller.  It's hard to describe his style.  It's very moody, erotic, and somewhat dramatic.  He photographs very handsome, lightly muscled young men who are dark looking and sultry.  I feel there's a lot of sexual tension in his images.<br />This 9th book in the Euros Series is a keeper, that's for sure.  I liked this photographer's style and as I said the mood he brings out in his models.  A definite one for the collection.	2001-05-17

There's not much more to say about Johan Paulik that hasn't been said before.  He is perhaps one of the top 3 all time favorite models of the Bel Ami stable of models.  His fans adore him.  If you familiar with Bel Ami videos you certainly are very familiar with Johan.  This book is devoted entirely to him, and these color images of him are excellent.  There are a few where he is posing with other Bel Ami models.  The charity, lighting and sensuality of these photos is perfect.<br />This book should definitely be in your collection.  These pictures celebrate sex,  not artistic concept.  They are open and honest, with no excuses.  Enjoy!	2001-05-14

This artist/photographer, Kingdome 19, born in Berlin in 1966 works on producing images on the borderline between photography and photographism.   A photographist takes a print from his own negatives and colors, paints over, scratches, cuts up and makes new combinations of the print, sometimes even colleges, or anything else possible to make a new unique art object.  In this Euros 07 series, Kingdome 19, has created a very erotic book of black &amp; white &amp; sepia-tone images of young, well-endowed nude men in settings that are classical and antique looking.  These photos are reminiscent of the turn of the century photographer F.Holland Day.  <br />I enjoyed Kingdome 19's photo images because they are different &amp; exciting.  This book is one of the best in the Euros Series and one of my favorites.	2001-05-14

This book, the third by Bonnie Doane, is a must for the new parrot owner or for those who have had a parrot for many years.  I found this book to be an excellent guide when I first got my new parrot.  I made sure I researched every book I could when I first acquired my two-week old baby parrot, and this book was one of my favorites.  I found it very helpful in the training &amp; learning process of handling my parrot as it matured and got older.  There are chapters on obedience skills and training techniques for adult parrots, as well as how to work with baby birds, speech training, and trick training.  There are 12 chapters filled with helpful advice that you should definitely be aware of.<br />I highly recommend this book.  You should check out her other two books, \\"My Parrot, My Friend\\" and \\"The Parrot in Health and Illness.\\"  These are excellent books for your bird-related library in my opinion.	2001-05-14

This sixth book in the Euros Series is a hot one by a photographer named \\"Dook.\\"  No information about this photographer is given at all.  This is a shame.  This is a great collection of images of guys enjoying themselves in the natural in a desert no less.  A larger collection &amp; a larger book of the same images was put out in 1990 by Bruno Gmunder, the same publisher of this small book.  Again, no information about the photographer was given. Dook is a very talented photographer, who had the unique idea to pose his models in the desert for a different type of photo session.  It works, but my one complaint is.....the models seem uninterested, or very unhappy.  They look very bored or maybe just overcome by the heat.  That problem put aside, these are photo images of very attractive and muscular men.  <br />A talented photographer who I wish I knew more about.  Another in this series to complete your collection!	2001-05-13

I learned more than I ever expected to learn about bike messengers and then some.  Who would ever think there would be so much to write about concerning the daily life &amp; adventures of a Chicago bike messenger.  Travis proves there is a lot more excitement than you would think.  In addition, he gives a very knowledgeable history of the design &amp; structure of Chicago's multilayered streets, its' subways, and its' landscape.  It's really fascinating to learn all about this.  The street races they have are told in such an exciting way it's makes you wish you were a messenger yourself.  Boy, it must be a real adrenaline rush.  <br />You can tell Travis loves to write and in great detail.  He is a poetic young man, full of emotion, and wonder, and it really comes through in his writing.  Rarely do you meet an author so in touch with his own feelings.  He really loves his job.  All the experiences that he has in this very special &amp; different type of job is expressed in beautiful &amp; colorful language.  <br />I truly enjoyed reading this book.  Now I really know what it must be like to be a bike messenger in a large metropolis.  A talented new writer races before us!  Be prepared to hold on tight.  Well-done!!!	2001-05-13

In this 3rd Edition Euros book you'll find a wonderful sampling of his most exciting images of young Mediterranean or Turkish men in black &amp; white prints.  These guys are young, and handsome.  Benno really knows how to pose his models to bring out the sensuality in all of them.  The lighting, shadows, &amp; location of the shots are perfect.  These models are relaxed and just being natural in their surroundings.  It makes you feel like you're a voyeur and that's the sign of an excellent photographer when you feel that way.<br />There are so many photo books out there it's hard to choose, much less collect them all.  This is definitely one of my favorite's.  A must have for your collection.  I hope to see more future photo images by this photographer... .	2001-05-13

These are mature, well-developed nude men in black &amp; white photos who seem to overflow with sexuality &amp; emotion.  They truly love being exhibitionist.  Thanks to a wonderful photographer, Jose Messana, who really knows how to bring out the best in his models.  You can tell Jose takes a lot of care in picking the right models and men to photograph, and captures their beauty with perfect lighting and shadows.  I really enjoyed this book.  Some of his images remind me of Tom Bianchi.  <br />As a collector of this series of books, I recommend this one.  This photographer who was born in Zurich, Switzerland is one of the best, and I assume that's why he is so popular and one of the best known photographer's of nudes in Europe.	2001-05-12

Another great book on companion parrot behavior, the second from Bonnie Doane.  This book will greatly help any parrot owner deal with any behavioral problems that may occur in your long-term relationship with your parrot.  Unhappy parrots and angry owners can lead to an unneccesary termination of your shared life together. You could have used some behavioral modification, solved the problem and avoided separation.  <br />I believe this book is an excellent source for the beginner who has a new parrot and is learning how to interact, adjust and bond with their new friend.  Parrots are not human, but very intelligent individuals with a mind of their own.  It takes a lot of study, time, and energy to learn why they react to different situations and conditions.  The more you know the happier your life will be together.<br />Before I found my perfect feathered friend I read every book available.  This book is a definite must for your bird-related library.  Knowledge is the key to understanding and the key to a long-life of companionship with your new parrot.  There are behavioral case studies included with this book which are very helpful and informative.  This author's books are wonderful.

Most of these guys photographed in this fourth book of the Edition Euros Series look like they would rather be somewhere else.  No one is playing with the camera or showing much emotion.  They all seem to be staring off at another planet, trying desperately to avoid contact with the camera.  Now don't get me wrong these are beautiful photos of very handsome and beautiful looking guys, both in facial features and body, but the lack of eye contact just left me cold.<br />As for the commentary at the end of the book, it meant nothing to me.  I can only say if you're a collector of this series you will definitely want this book, but I won't be revisiting this one as much as the other photographer's works!	2001-05-12

We'll never know how far Mark Brickell male erotic vision would have gone.  Sadly, he left us in February 1994.  This second book in the series is a highly erotic and beautiful showcase of male nude photographs.  This Canadian photographer had a way with displaying the male nude in a very simply but erotic vision, much like that of Robert Mapplethorpe.  His models are draped in cloth, and symbolism, but presented in their stark nudity, displaying their well-endowed eroticism to the best advantage.  These black and white images of young men are very bold and stunning in their sharpness &amp; clarity.  <br />This is a wonderful second edition to this series.

This is the first in a series of small format books put out by Bruno Gmunder that eventually grew to total 17 books showcasing the new male nude photographers.  Some more well know than others.  This first book of Clifford Baker's photography was not the most impressive in the series.  These are black &amp; white images of very muscular young men, mostly nude.  Many of the models are very handsome &amp; certainly pleasant to look at.  However, I had one problem with the all of these images and that is they all too posed.  There isn't much feeling or emotion coming out of these photographs.  The camera should bring these models to life, it fails in this respect.  Most are shot outdoors in awkward situations.<br />I think this is a good representation of Clifford Baker's work, and with all due respect, you either like his work or you don't.  If you're a collector like I am than you certainly should have this first book of the series in your collection.  If you're buying is limited check out the other 16 books before you decide on this one.	2001-05-11

This book is a valuable guide for all parrot lovers, and owners, who want to know the latest in avian medicine.  In these eight chapters Doane covers in great detail everything you need to know to better take care of your companion parrot.  There are chapters on picking an Avian Veterinarian, knowing the signs of a Well Bird and a Sick Bird, using proper first aid in the event of accidents, disease problems, avian surgery and there's even a chapter on dealing with the loss when a bird dies.  <br />This is the first in a series of books authored by Bonnie Doane, and it is excellent.

What we have here in this new book of male images by Adam Raphael is a different approach to showing the male model.  Raphael brings out in these young, innocent and sensitive male models their best features.  These are not professional models, and as the title says friends, that are both new and old.  There's no full nudity needed with these models, although most are shirtless &amp; in designer underwear. It's their beauty in body and facial features that is truly stunning.  These guys are all young, very handsome, muscular, as in not big and overdeveloped.  They are normal everyday young men who happen to be very handsome, too, ....  <br />This is a small book showcasing about 14 young men in black &amp; white images of various sizes.  I really enjoyed the photography of Adam Raphael.  I'm certainly glad I added it to my collection.  I hope this photographer releases a larger collection of his photographs in the near future.  My only disappointment with this book was that no biography of this wonderful photographer was included, as I would like to know more about him.

I remember in the 1970's collecting his photography in magazines, paperback books, and other sources.  His work has always fascinated me because he only worked in color photography, while other photographers were producing male nude images in black &amp; white only.  He is truly a master in color prints.  In this new book you're seeing his best shots of the most young and handsome, and very muscular (as in big) men that he ever produced.  Although I have seen most of these men before, being an avid collector of his work, its nice to have them all collected here in this big book.  As for the collector who is not familiar with Roy's photography this is a perfect book to start with.  All the models are nude, large in many ways and I do believe many are former Colt Studio models.<br />Roy Dean started his career in the theatre and appeared in many Broadway productions.  He also appeared in many films, including \\"My Fair Lady\\", \\"King Rat\\", \\"Music Man\\" and \\"Sextet.\\"  Arriving in New York in the 1950's he acted his way onto Broadway, and later became a photographer of male nudes, one of the first, a pioneer in this field.  <br />Did I really enjoy this book? Yes.  Is it worth having in my collection? Yes.  The only fault I might find with this book is that some of the color male nude images are a little blurry, but this is probably due to the period these photos were taken, the 60's &amp; 70's and the transfer to this large book size. However, that's a very minor problem,  most of the images are crystal clear and beautiful.  Roy Dean's photography will always share a special place in my collection.  He's a very special photographer, a pioneer of our time, and a very different and original photographer!	2001-05-10

This is a great book to start with if you are a new parent to a companion parrot or plan on getting one soon.  I don't say own a parrot because you never really do.  They are all very unique individuals with different personalities, who may come to own you!  It goes without saying \\"Never buy a companion parrot unless you have done a lot of research first.\\"  It's a big responsibility that shouldn't be taken lightly.  That said, this is a great book with so much helpful and useful information that is also wonderfully illustratred with color photos of the many species of parrots.<br />There are chapters on \\"Early Interactions\\" with your parrot,  learning their \\"Behavior Patterns\\", their \\"Behavior Problems\\",  &amp;  dealings  with any \\"Aggression\\" problems, and many other chapters on any problems that may occur.  There are even some cute real life stories at the end that will amuse you and may also break your heart.  All are meant to be very helpful for your parrot training.  <br />Choosing the right companion parrot for you and your loved one can be a wonderful experience, but should be done with a lot of planning, thought and research.  Mattie Athan has written one of the best books available to help in this subject.  I highly recommend this book as a great place to begin your research or as a refresher course for those experienced companion parrot parents!	2001-05-10

It was such a pleasure to just  sit back, relax, and read this story.  This very unconventional love story of the 80's was very touching, fresh, and different.  Once in a while a book comes along where I just don't want to stop reading it or have it end, and this was one of them.<br />David and Katherine meet at Stanford College, and very quickly become best friends.  Two people that should be lovers, but aren't because David is just coming out and is gay.  They share an apartment in San Francisco, and set out to find the right man for each of them.  Unknown to each other, they both find the same Mr. Right, a stunning and good-looking guy name Ross.  Ross is going to Stanford Law School.  What follows after this is a comedy of situations and surprises for all concerned.  There are a lot of emotions played out in this easy to read, and short novel.  These are characters that you can really care for, who are just discovering adult life, and love.  <br />It's a shame this book is out of print.  I managed to find a copy, and I think you should be able to get one from Amazon without any problem.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys an enlightening &amp; pleasant read.

I read the first one many years ago, collected all the others, but have failed to get to them.  Shame on me!  After reading this wonderful ending to the Henry Rios series, I know now that I will definitely read all his other books ASAP.  This was a wonderful story with real characters, and it was a real page turner.  These characters are real people, who make up a true &amp; caring family, and it doesn't matter whether they happen to be gay or straight.  This book had true passion, something for everyone and plenty of love in many different guises.<br />While Rios is recuperating from a heart attack, he learns that his sister had an illegitimate daughter many years ago, who now has a son of her own and she has come to find her mother for help so she can escape from an abusive husband.  Her husband is found shot dead and now it's Rios turn to fight for Vicky's innocence.  In the meantime his sister, Elena; Vicky's son, Angelito, and Rios new found love John, slowly become a very close and unexpected family.  Proving Vicky's innocence,however, takes on a much darker, and unexpected turn, and causes Rios to even alter some events of his own life.  Right up to almost the last chapter you're left wondering how everything will turn out. <br />Michael Nava has ended the Henry Rios novels with another great mystery.  It's with sorrow that he has decided to end the series, but it's with a great appreciation that I myself say Thank You to this fine and talented writer.  Bravo!!!	2001-05-01

Someone has written a biography of Sal Mineo's career and his personal life.  This is a long over-due book.  I think Paul Jeffers has done a wonderful job in giving us Sal Mineo's career every step of the way, and also in writing about his personal life.  Yes, this book may be one-sided by only talking about Sal's gay relationships, and not mentioning his heterosexual affairs with women.  However, the last years of his life he admitted he was gay, and that's all I expected from this author.  <br />I will always remember my introduction to Sal Mineo.  I happened to catch a movie on late night TV called \\"Who Killed Teddy Bear\\" and couldn't believe how erotic this young actor was who was stalking this woman name Norah Dain.  There Sal was lying on the bed, very muscular, in white briefs (a first for TV in 1965) making a sexy phone call to an unsuspecting Norah.  I couldn't believe my eyes, who is this actor?  Well, ever since then I followed his career like a true devoted fan.  I don't think anyone could ever forget \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\"after seeing it.  Sal &amp; James Dean &amp; Natalie Wood's acting performance made history with this movie &amp; will always be remembered.  Finally, young people and their trouble lives were being recognized.  <br />It's just so sad that Sal's life had to end at such an early age, when his career was looking up again.  Hollywood was not kind at all to Sal.  However, he will always be with us through his movies that we certainly will never forget.  I enjoyed this biography of Sal's career and life, and thank Paul Jeffers for this well-researched book.

A time of coming to terms with oneself, your identity, and the process of accepting or denying who you are and the feelings that go with that.  It's a very complex process and an even more difficult one when you come to realize you are gay.  Growing up is a time of great discovery and this author shares his many memories of that time in his life in an intelligent and honest way.  I think he's a great storyteller, and his memories brought back many memories of my own boyhood.  It made me think about a lot of things I had long forgotten or buried in the back of my mind.  <br />These essays are the best when he is just focusing on telling the stories.  It's when he starts to theorize or psychoanalyze every event using language that requires me to grab my dictionary every other sentence that I really got frustrated and wanted to give up.  However, he always seemed to get back on track and then I couldn't stop reading about his early boyhood memories.<br />I especially enjoyed \\"Checks and Balances\\" about his experience with classmate Luke and his first sexual feelings, and \\"Questions of Travel\\", that wonderful experience of \\"the\\" family vacations, which is so easy to relate to.  <br />The moments of frustration aside, I really did enjoy this book.  Probably because I could identify with so much of James boyhood and his early experiences.  If you want an intellectual read, I believe this book is a true success, and very enjoyable!  It brought back many memories for me and it will for you, too!	2001-04-13

Don't they think we know anything?  Well, one look at that homoerotic cover and I couldn't wait to shell out the money and order it.  And what a pleasant surprise this book is, it really has a lot to offer for the new gay guy just coming out or the guy with tons of experience like myself (so I thought till I read this book).  <br />This is really a book loaded with tons of info about all aspects of gay sex and dating.  There's a lot of good advice here.  \\"Master\\" Anderson has written a very hilarious and funny book.  Even if you think you know everything already, you'll learn something new from this book.  Or you should just buy it for the humor, it will keep you in stitches.  I couldn't stop laughing when I read about \\"Sex with a Drag Queen\\" and \\"Sex with a Bossy Bottom.\\"  There's a chapter for every possible sex partner you could think of.  <br />I read this book in one setting.  After the first couple of chapters, I just couldn't put it down.  This is truly an entertaining journey through the nuts and bolts of gay sex.  This is a welcome edition from the author who brought us \\"Sex Tips for Straight Women from a Gay Man.\\"  So next time you're in a bar give a \\"Twirl\\" and then head straight home with your new man for some \\"M&amp;M's.\\"  You might even get a \\"Pearl Necklace\\" out of it.  Read this book and you'll know what I mean!!!	2001-04-12

My friend Grady was right when he said in his review that this story \\"Being Dead\\" somehow illuminates \\"Being Alive.\\"  It's because of his wonderful review &amp; recommendation that I didn't miss this brilliant &amp; well-written book from an author I had not previously known or read.<br />It's the story of Joseph &amp; Celice, two doctors of zoology, who have been murdered while enjoying a beautiful day of remembrance on the dunes at Baritone Bay.  This senseless &amp; horrific murder ended a wonderful life for these two partners of almost 30 years.<br />The visual images of their dead and gradual decay &amp; decomposing bodies was very hard for me to take.  The author has left no details out and seems to draw these horrible images for us to make his point, and perhaps to make us face our own reality.  It's all for a good reason.  He wants us to know the body may die but the spirit of love lives on.  So be forewarned if you get a little weak at the thought of the details of dead.<br />This is a wonderful story that I will always remember.  A book you can't forget.  It makes you think about the value of life and what is really important.  We are only here for a short period of time, and we should cherish and make the most of it, every day, every moment.  Thanks, Grady, for this gift, and I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves life!!!	2001-04-10

This is got to be one of the best guide books I have ever seen featuring over 350 different species of parrots on our planet.  Being the bird lover that I am, and that includes domestic as well as wild birds,  I own almost every book out there on birds, and I really love this edition by Tony Juniper &amp; Mike Parr.  It should really be called an encyclopedia because there is just so much information in these almost 600 pages.  The 88 superb color illustrations of all the species by 5 different artists are so beautiful &amp; true to life.  As you already know by reading the editorial &amp; other reviews, this book includes range maps of the species locations, their vocalizations, life expectancies, and much more fascinating information.<br />Remember, this is not a book about parrots in captivity, its information about birds in the wild.  If you don't own a parrot and are thinking about one, this book is a definite help in learning about all the different species that are out there.  The more knowledge you have the better it will be when you do decide to pick out that perfect companion parrot for yourself &amp; family.  Owning a companion parrot is a lifetime commitment that shouldn't be taken lightly.  I know I researched many months before I found the perfect parrot for us.  The love you receive in return from your parrot will amaze you.  I wish I could give this book more than 5 stars.  Highly recommended!	2001-04-07

He certainly didn't show much emotion at all through most of the story.  However, my whole attitude and judgement of him changed so much by the end of this engrossing story.  When Eamon was very young he stood by silently and passively watching his father die (his mother was already dead), and then when he was older and a well-respected Judge, he watched as his wife Carmel die after having a stroke.  Both of these dead's and there influence on Eamon's life are minutely detailed here.  Eamon seems to be an intense and very lonely person.  Yes, there is some attention given to his first girlfriend, and his children (who barely know their father) but the turning point, I think, is after Carmel dies.  I think Eamon finally finds his heart, and the love he was too busy to recognize before.  The ending is wonderful.  <br />Colm Toibin has a way of beautifully describing family life and especially the landscape of Ireland.  I learned a lot about Irish politics of that time, and how a judge makes his important decisions.  A well-crafted novel from an author who has written many powerful books.  I am always touched by his rich  &amp; moving novels.	2001-04-05

I just wish this book was available when I came out and discovered my gay identity many years ago.  Maria has put together in these 13 Chapters all the questions &amp; answers that may effect your personal growth as a gay or lesbian.   It's an excellent tool for anyone just coming out in dealing with the many questions &amp; feelings that may arise in discovering and validating your new homosexual life.  It's a wonderful source for anyone who wants to feel positive about their gay identity and/or to better understand their homosexual feelings.  This is an excellent book for all gays &amp; even straights so that they can fully understand the importance of our rites of passage &amp; rituals in our gay lives. These rites of passages are our life experiences &amp; growth transitions that are different for homosexuals than for heterosexuals.    Anyone having  a problem with their homosexual feelings, relationships, or questioning their gay or lesbian identity will find this book very helpful.  <br />There are included many exercises in the chapters with excellent questions that if answered honestly should be a great help to any gay or lesbian's development in life.  This book would be a wonderful resource for any parent to read to help them better understand their gay/lesbian son or daughter.  Highly Recommended!!	2001-04-05

I was more than impressed with this wonderful collection/study of over three dozen rural gay men who grew up on farms in the Midwest.  I never had the experience of living on a farm, having lived in the city while I was growing up, so this was a real eye opener for me.  These gay coming of age stories told by the individuals are spell-binding.   You not only learn about their first gay experiences, what their families were like, and their everyday life on the farms, but what happened to these individuals after leaving, which most of them did, their farming lives.  <br />This is an excellent look into the lives of these rural gay men and their isolated struggles.  It should be required reading for any gay history course.  It is fascinating and so well-researched.  There are many books out there covering gay life in the cities.  This is a wonderful and enlightening study of the rural gay man.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!	2001-04-05

There are two bonus books included with this collection, plus lots of cowboys stories that are really hot &amp; sexy &amp; explicit fantasies.  You can add to that a lot of hot photos on the cover &amp; inside of young good-looking guys, especially of Emilio Sands.  This book is a must for the collector of gay male erotic stories.

Again, I wasn't disappointed.  I enjoyed this beautifully written novel as much as \\"The Blackwater Lightship.\\"  Colm's sentences are very long and full of details, and once you get use to his masterful style of writing you just can't stop reading.  I think that's what I like most about his writing, that everything is brought to the surface, and no details are left out.<br />There are actually two main themes here, and they are combined beautifully.  It's the story of Argentina during the Falkland Wars and its struggle for democracy &amp; freedom, and the story of a gay man's coming of age who is also struggling to find himself, his place in life &amp; real love.  I think Richard Garay &amp; Pablo's love for each other is beautifully developed in a very sensitive true-to life way.  Although your heart may break by the end of this story you'll remember these characters long after you finish this book.  <br />If you like a book that can take you away, make you happy, bring tears to your eyes, and teach you a lot about other people &amp; their cultures, this book is definitely worth a read.  This book is written with intelligence and was a sheer pleasure to read!	2001-03-28

In this book he interviews 20 new Bad Boys of Porn, and most of the interviews are very interesting.  You don't have to know most of these porn stars but it helps in understanding some of the people's names that dropped that are involved in the industry.  I think I enjoyed \\"Vince Rockland's &amp; Sandy Sloan's\\" interviews the most.  These two seemed to be the most honest &amp; no-holds barred interviewees.  They tell it like it is.  As usual the book is loaded with many hot nude photos of the porn stars.  <br />If you enjoy viewing and reading about your favorite all-male porn stars this book is a must.  It's really interesting to read about all these guys like's &amp; dislike's, and to get to know them as more than just hot bodies on video.  It's a great reference book, and a fascinating &amp; enjoyable read.	2001-03-28

Auden was right when he said \\"Love Each Other or Perish.\\"  After reading this story you will definitely want to tell those nearest &amp; dearest to you how much you love them.  We could all use more love in our lives.  This story is certainly filled with the deepest love between a mentor and a student.  Mitch Albom has come to visit, help &amp; seek wisdom from his college professor from nearly 20 years ago, who is dying from Lou Gehrig's Disease (ALS).  Mitch spends 14 Tuesdays talking and learning about the\\"lessons of life\\" from Morrie.  As the days grow shorter for Morrie its very heartbreaking to read about his suffering, but also very enlightening that someone could be so strong and courageous in the light of dead.  It gives one hope and strength to face the enviable when our own time comes after reading this.   How true it is when Morrie states, \\"Without Love, We are Birds with Broken Wings.\\"  A very touching, wonderful book.  I'm so glad I read this book.

The author admits he was once a stripper, so he really knows where to find hot men &amp; photograph them to their best possible advantage.  I think he's right.  This is a great selection of mostly nude Australian guys who are average to very good looking.  Some of these models are muscular but most are light and well-defined.  Most images are in black &amp; white, and there are some very beautiful color shots.  <br />Mike has been a photographer of male nudes for the past 16 years in the UK and Australia.  It was a pleasure to discover this very talented photographer, and enjoy his images.  I hope to see a larger collection of his work published in the future.  Highly recommended.	2001-03-20

I really liked this book.  E. Lynn Harris is probably the most popular black fiction writer today, and his novels blend romantic stories that deal with controversial issues such as race, AIDS, and bisexuality.<br />In this story, Basil Henderson, a handsome ex-football player who has a history of loving both men and women, decides to marry Yancey, a fledging Broadway star.  There marriage is only two months away and fate seems to be threatening their possible future together.  Ava, Yancey's mother, who has always controlled her daughter, is about to meet her match in Basil.  Is Yancey as bad as she seems, or is she really in love?  Is she for real?  Or is she just out for Basil's money?  And how can Basil keep his other sexual life a secret from his future bride?  Is he ready to be a give up his affairs with men.  The story becomes more and more complicated as secrets are kept and more lies are told.  What will really happen?  <br />I did care about these characters and how their lives were going to turn out.  I think that's a good sign of a talented writer.  I will be eager to see what this author has in store for us in his next book.  I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.  It's got my recommendation!	2001-03-20

I wasn't disappointed at all.  James Loy  amazes me in how his use of light &amp; shadows brings out the sensual features of all of his models he photographs.  This is a wonderful book of very classic black &amp; white images of very good-looking male models.  They are all very young, probably in there 20's and of course, are very masculine and muscular.  These are the type of men you might encounter on a hot sunny day at the beach.  I especially enjoyed Plates 65-67 called \\"Reflections 1,2 &amp; 3,\\"  a very sensual imaginary of a handsome young male model enjoying his mirror image.  Most of these photos are taken in the outdoors and are very relaxed &amp; unposed.  There are a few nudes, but most are semi-clothed.  I certainly look forward to James Loy's next collection of male photography.	2001-03-20

Michael Ford knows how to put into words what we as gay or queer people are really feeling and he does it in a very amusing way.  He tells the truth about gay people.  You won't find too much PC here.  And that's a welcome relief.  Michael may sound grumpy at times, in fact he's grumpy a lot, but it's in a loving &amp; funny way.  I loved this book, especially the chapters: \\"If the Shoe Fits\\" about Milton Berle &amp; RuPaul  and \\"Why Am I Queer\\" where he states as his closing statement, \\"What matters is being who we are, and not what someone else wants us to be.\\"  That says it all.  <br />If you want a good laugh make sure you read this book, and you don't have to be gay (queer) to enjoy it either.  There's no topic that's too controversial for Michael, and sooner or later he talks about it.  Enjoyable &amp; Very Funny.	2001-03-16

It's so full of energy I guarantee you once you've opened this book you won't close it till you're finished.  It's has a little bit of everything woven into this story; drugs, sex, psychotic cops, murder, violence, hate and a lot of love.  I was riveted to this story once I started it.  Nick &amp; Jeff are brutalized by the police when they are discovered in bed making love &amp; having sex.  This being consensual sex between two adults in their own apartment.  After Jeff &amp; Nick fight back, one of the cops dies &amp; both of their lives are changed forever.   Now they have no choice but to flee and end up on the run through Hollywood to save their lives.  You'll have a different view of beautiful Hollywood after reading this book.  Every place they go to in their escape it's a matter of life &amp; death, and the action &amp; tense situations they get themselves into are so realistic you find yourself cheering them on.  Will Nick &amp; Jeff escape?  Will they find love together again?  Or be jailed, brutalized more, or even murdered?  <br />It's truly sad that the late James Baker is no longer with us.  All of his books are ground-breaking, realistic, and disturbing because they take you into the darkness society doesn't want exposed on the surface.  This book is from the same author who gave us \\"Tim &amp; Pete\\" &amp; \\"Testosterone\\", two other masterpieces of fiction.  A great read.	2001-03-15

What a remarkable story that bridges two centuries in a small seaside town.  I couldn't stop reading it.  I was so eager to find out what was going to happen.  I was really shocked and pleasantly surprised with the ending and how the story took a turn so that it was entirely different than what I had expected.  This is a spell-binding story that concerns the sexually triangled affair of Roger Lynch, his wife, Karen, and Roger's cousin, Chas.  They are all brought together in a cycle of passion that is hard to break.  Will Roger be able to uncover the long-hidden secret of this small town?  And what inescapable destiny does it hold for all of them?  If I were to tell you anymore about the story it would certainly ruin the surprise of this well-crafted novel.  <br />I think this is one of Felice Picano's best books that he has ever written.  Remember what I said in the beginning, everything falls into place after Chapter 2.  It may seem a little confusing before that.  As an added bonus to Felice's story there are wonderful illustrations by Ron Fowler (fowlergallery) that go along with the story.  Just take a look at the two page black &amp; white drawings on Page 188-189, of the horse-drawn carriage and rural surroundings.  It is just simply beautiful.  The illustrations really help to bring the story to life.  I wish I could give this book more than five stars.  Find out for yourself.  My best recommendation!	2001-03-12

I always await his new listings every year because it makes it so easy to find the best videos, especially when there is so many out there to choose from.  <br />Each video is summarized, and Mickey tells us why he thinks it's one of the best, and gives us some behind the scenes information you won't find anywhere else.

I think this is one of the \\"best\\" books I have read in a long time.  Reiken knows how to make you care about his characters &amp; really love them.  This book seems more like a true story than a work of fiction.  <br />One late Spring morning sixteen year old Ethan Shumway disappears and vanishes without a trace.  Philip, Ethan's younger brother, narrates the events and feelings of all of his family and their friends after this tragic event that shocks and paralyzes all the community of this rural hilltown in western Massachusetts.  Was Ethan abducted, kidnapped by a child molester or did he just want to disappear on his own for some reason?  Will the truth be ever known, and does Philip and his family finally find out the reason he disappeared?  Well, it's through Philip's emotional re-telling of the events of the last five years after his disappearance that  make this such a wonderful story.  How it effected Philip's parents, and his three wonderful sisters is a lesson in true family love.  What a difficult and terrible thing to happen to a family that truly loves each other so much.<br />Paul Reiken's writing is so realistic and emotionally tender and loving.  I will never forget this book.  It makes one wonder how and what you would do if the same situation happened to someone you love and care about very deeply.  My highest recommendation.  A stunning debut novel.	2001-03-09

I thought \\"Huge\\" (the first collection) was big, but this new collection edited by John Patrick proves that \\"size does matter.\\"  There are almost 600 pages here of hot, sexy, sizzling stories of man on man sex.  Plus there are two bonus novellas included that will certainly keep you busy.  Yes, these are good stories, but the sex is also non-stop and very erotic.  This book contains a multitude of erotic tales that John Patrick has gathered together here for every taste.  I especially enjoyed \\"Bus Stop\\" by Peter Eros, \\"A Storm Hits New Orleans\\" by Sean Storm, and \\"Big &amp; Beautiful\\" by John Patrick.  <br />If the stories aren't hot enough just wait till you see the hot and sexy photos on the cover and inside.

This is not an easy book to read and I think that DeLillo is playing tricks with our minds.  He must be a good writer because I couldn't stop reading this small book (novel?) until I got to the end in one sitting.  You really have to concentrate on every line that he writes.  There is so much thought and information in each line.  I found myself reading over entire paragraphs twice.   I believe this book should be read more than once for many reasons.  After Lauren Hartke's husband kills himself she is confronted with day to day living, her wondering thoughts, and the fear of being left behind.  It's like listening to someone who is in a trance, struggling through her every moment of the day.  Lauren's discovery of a boy in the house who speaks like Rey and also knows Rey's last words &amp; thoughts is truly mind-boggling for her.  Is he really Rey reincarnated, or a ghost, or maybe just her imagination?<br />Did I really enjoy this book? Yes.  Do I really know what happened?  I'm still not  sure I know the truth.  I like a book that makes you think, and keeps you wondering about it long after you're done reading it.  Don DeLillo has written a book that I am certain will be a best seller.	2001-03-06

I think this is Tom Perrotta's best novel yet, although \\"Election\\" is right on its tail.  I enjoyed this novel and by the middle of the book I felt like I knew these characters and cared about them.  Perrotta really knows how to write about college life.  He has everything done to a tee.  Danny's life as a Yale junior, his affairs with Cindy and Polly, plus his involvement in his father's business on his school breaks all lead to some very funny, and interesting situations.  Whether you like Danny's as a person you'll have to decide for yourself.  I thought he was kind of a sad character myself, but a person who seemed to get what he wants in a round about way.<br />I usually enjoy Tom Perrotta's novels.  They have a way of taking you away and are an easy read for a quiet afternoon or evening.  I certainly look forward to his next selection.	2001-03-02

Written as a transcript from tapes sent by Dean Seagrave to Jim Baker, it tells the story of Dean's love for Pablo.  To even attempt to describe this story would ruin the joy you'll find in its entertaining pages.  It's not easy to read, and sometimes hard to take, but I found it really worth the effort.  This is a novel you won't soon forget.  It lingers on the mind for days to come.  You are either going to love it or hate it.<br />Baker committed suicide in November 1997.  Too bad Baker is no longer with us.  His writing is truly brilliant and so different.   This novel packs a punch and won't fail to move and effect whomever reads it.  That's for sure!	2001-02-26

It was interesting enough to keep my attention but nothing out of the ordinary happened, just everyday life for these characters.   Dave &amp; Julie have been sweethearts since high school.  The words \\"I Love You\\" have always come easy to both of them.  Their love for each other was always there, even though they had several on and off breakups.  Dave's always loved music and plays in a small wedding band called \\"The Wishbones.\\"  He's always had the freedom to play his music and live a half-way decent life by still living at home with his parents.  Everything changes when the words slip out from Julie, \\"Let's get married.\\"  Will Dave decide to marry Julie, or continue to live the single life playing in the band?  It's a decision he makes too quickly and then regrets after meeting Gretchen and having an affair with her.  Now his decision becomes even harder.  <br />I would definitely recommend this well-written book for those out there who haven't decided to get married yet.  Did Dave make the right decision or didn't he?  You can make that decision after finishing this book.  Maybe Tom Perrotta is giving a good lesson here-people should not get married just to be married.  Where's the fire?	2001-02-23

This is especially true when we are in love.  Or even more so when we are in love not only with the person but with the glamour, money and fame that goes with loving a celebrity.  That's why I especially enjoyed this book.  It was so realistic and true to life when it comes to being in love and being used and not realizing it.  It's a book you can't put down.  In fact, I read it thru in one setting.  It was that interesting and moving.  I had to know what happened in the end right away.  I believe this book should have been an autobiography but was presented as a novel.  Who knows for what reason, maybe some of the story isn't completely true.  Douglas' secret love of a celebrity rock star (we all know who he is, he's been named in other reviews) is such an eye opening experience for him.  He made this happen in his obsessive desire to be with this rock star, and later finds his whole life has changed because of it.  There's glamour, parties, new friends, and more money than he has ever seen before.  It's quite a different life being away from his dysfunctional family. That's a whole other story told in great detail in this book.<br />Douglas writes with a quick and fast pace style.  So much happens so fast in each page you become totally involved devoting your full attention to his every word.  I really enjoyed reading about Douglas's life and will certainly look forward to this young author's future writings.	2001-02-22

It's an inspiring story about how tough it can be at this age learning about friends, relationships and dealing with pier pressure.  Benjamin Lebert also has to deal with another problem, partial paralysis.  Life's pretty tough at this age, but it's even harder for Benni.  A lot of his education takes place after school hours, as the young boys learn about real life at the girl's dorm, their first sex, alcohol, and even an adventure to Munich.  <br />I was amazed at the skill presented here by this very young author who has a written a very touching and sensitive story (part autobiographical) about his experiences in boarding school.  This is a book for everyone to read from a very talented German author.  If Crazy is Lebert's debut to the world than this young author has a very bright future.  Check this touching story out for yourself.  I am sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did.	2001-02-20

This is a beautiful oversize book of mostly color &amp; some black &amp; white photographs of exotic &amp; naked beautiful men.  Some of these photographs give you the feeling you are looking at Renaissance paintings.  The men are posed in natural surroundings indoors and outdoors.  You could say not all of the men are handsome but they all have an erotic &amp; sexual tension to them.  I believe that's because Julian Hargreaves has done what other photographers rarely do, and that is to pose his models at different angles with perfect lighting.  These are not neatly cropped photos.  This lends a style of movement to the whole collection which is so much better that the standard static and rigid photographs of most photographers.  The men are not adonis's, just normal guys who are not overly special or beyond attainability.  They are slim and athletic.  <br />I liked the look of this book, and especially enjoyed Hargreaves style of photography.  It is different and refreshing.  I just wish they had included a biography of Julian.  I was disappointed there was none.  A wonderful addition to any male nude photography collection!	2001-02-17

Now a deputy prosecutor he likes his new life but still longs for the days when he was free to hang out at the clubs, and date all the girls he wants.  Will Pete settle down and find the right girl to marry or will he continue to wander in the clubs aimlessly?<br />A well-written story if you are into the alternative rock scene in Seattle or if you can relate or identify with these characters and their lives. There are endless quotes of different songs and alternative bands.  I enjoyed this story although at the end I couldn't relate to its conclusion.    The story sounds almost autobiographical.  If you loved \\"Nirvana\\" you love this book.  Enjoy.	2001-02-16

If you like to see your men shirtless this is the book for you.  Over 175 celebrity stars, actors, hunks, whatever you want to call them are here for your enjoyment.  It's great that someone has finally brought together all the photos of these shirtless stars of past and present fame in one book.  I rather enjoyed the comments made by author Donald Reuter throughout the book describing the photographs which helped to give the book a gay sensibility.  As an added bonus it can serve as a reference book because all the stars dates of birth are given and regretfully the dates of those that have passed on.  <br />From the very attractive cover design to the unique size of the book, this is one book that should be in your collection.  A few stars were missing, but all in all a good representation.  Highly recommended!	2001-02-16

Subtitled \\"The Secret Nudes of Denny Denfield\\" this is another book of male nudes brought to us by David Chapman (\\"Hollywood Nudes\\", \\"Adonis\\", &amp; \\"Mountain Men\\") who has been an inspiration in giving us a history of gay male nude photographers.  This photographer was not known at all compared to most of the rest.  I thought this book was an excellent display of his male nudes.  There are about 63 pages of nudes here, not a big book, but a good representation of his work.  These are photos of men from that era in clear black &amp; white set in outdoor surroundings.  It's surprising how muscular these men were for that time period.  <br />Denny loved photos of nude men, which were hard to purchase in the repressive 50's.  So he spend many hours taking his own on the beach of the many attractive men he met.  These are very posed pictures but the men are none the less erotic.  I enjoyed learning about this photographer and seeing his photos for the first time in this book.	2001-02-16

However, all of my friends have been telling me how much they enjoyed them and how they can't wait for the next book to come out.  So I took a chance, and I'm glad I did.  Fascinating stuff here.  This author really has some imagination.  It's my first fantasy book and I loved it.  It's all about Harry Potter and his adventures at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br />Who says these books are just for children?  Anyone of any age I believe will love this book.  It's so simple to read, yet so captivating.  Well, I'm off on my broomstick to read the second book.  Later.............	2001-02-15
US	52556992	R39KACSE9HWDGM	3000069615	158922876	Work and Body	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Beauty at Work!!	This beautiful oversized book of photographs by Denis Wohler is truly stunning.  There are 12 models shown in full size black &amp; white (almost sepia-tone) photographs, shot in outdoor locations in Germany, who are all very handsome and attractive.  These are not big muscle men, but very lithe and muscular young men in their 20's? who are not overly developed.  Denis photographs his models in a natural way. There are no rigid poses here.  You feel you are a voyeur in a way looking at these handsome men.  Most of the guys are in torn 501's with bare chests (no full nudity) posing in a very erotic way.  <br />Denis Wohler was born in Branunschweig, Germany in 1965 and started photographing for pleasure at the age of 12.  When he reached 17 he turned his camera to male photography.  This is my first introduction to this photographer and I was very impressed.  I look forward to the release of his next book called \\"Cool Water.\\"  This is a photographer not to be missed.	2001-02-15

Even Bruce &amp; Seth Hall, two blonde beautiful male twins, are presented here in sexy bikini's and mesh stockings.  Quite a sight.  Not only are there beautiful male models, but many celebrities &amp; stars, such as Joe Dallesandro from Midnight Cowboy; Hollywood porn director-drag queen Chi Chi LaRue on a porno set; and the legendary Jimmy James as Marilyn Monroe, among others.  <br />Yes there's a little bit of Hollywood represented here but so much more.  What is amazing with Michael's photography is his unique imagination in posing his models in such a different way than other photographers do.  His photographs are always fascinating but never boring or static. He began his career in the 70's and today is one of the entertainment industry's most renowned photographers, having photographed all the top stars.  <br />I really loved this book and it will share a special place in my collection.  It was beautifully designed by Kevin Scott Hees.  A very erotic and different collection of photographs.  Perhaps there will be a Volume 2?  We can hope.	2001-02-06

I really enjoyed this memoir called \\"The Lost Years\\" 1945-1951 because of its openness &amp; honesty.  If your interested in Christopher's daily life in every detail, from his friends, sex partners, lovers, and acquaintances it's all here.  I expected to get details about all faucets of his daily life from this memoir and that's exactly what I got.  If your looking for a sugar coated boring sexless book,  look elsewhere.  Christopher is very honest in laying out in graphic detail his sexual conquests.  But that's not to say the book is just about his sexual life, it's like I said about all the daily details of his everyday life for those years.  There's a wonderful Chronology in the back of the book for a quick history lesson of his life, and a glossary that is outstanding that contains all the bio's and history of his friends, partners,  and relatives.<br />This book really opened my eyes to this wonderful writer, who happened to be gay.  I thought the 90's were gay but after reading this book, things weren't much different back in the 40's.  Gay life as we call it today, was really just as gay back then.  Katherine Bucknell has done a wonderful job in editing this book, and gives us a wonderful introduction.  Getting to know Christopher Isherwood as a writer and a human being has been a wonderful experience for me.  Highly recommended.	2001-02-05

This was my first exposure to Colm Toibin's writing and I really enjoyed it.  This is a beautifully written novel set in the early 1990's in Ireland where three generations of very independent strong-willed women; daughter, mother, and grandmother, have come together to face the tragic illness of Declan who is dying of AIDS.  Declan's sister, mother, and grandmother must each deal with this issue.  However, what the story is really about is how they must first deal with a decade of estrangement from each other, and how they must now come to terms  with each other and maybe become a family again.  Is this possible?  Or will Helen remain as cold to her mother as she has been the past 10 years?  What is revealed about their past will answer these questions.<br />An easy read, but a story that's filled with lots of detail, emotion, and yes even love.  I believe the story pivoting on Helen as the main character was well done.  Yes, it could have dealt more with Declan's life and his friends, but that's not what the book was about.  The women are the central point, and the author has done a wonderful job in a beautifully written story here.  I look forward to checking out his other books now.	2001-02-05

I look forward to this book every year as I have for the past 10 years.  Each year it gets bigger and bigger and this year it's over 600 pages.  Everything you want to know about the sexiest young guys of the past year is included, straight and gay.  All the sex, scandal and gossip you could want to read about.  This includes articles about actors Tom Cruise, Leonardo Dicaprio, Rob Lowe, Brad Pitt, Mark Wahlberg, and many others.  Included are the sexiest movie stars, TV stars, music stars, and artists and models.  And there's plenty of information about the hot &amp; sexy new porn stars, and escorts.  There are so many hot &amp; sexy photos you can't help but  keep your eyes glued to the pages.<br />I give John Patrick a lot of credit, his writing has been a driving force in the gay community for many years, and he is not given enough credit for all the wonderful anthologies, and especially the \\"Superstars\\" books he has published over the years.  I really enjoyed this edition.  It's the best yet.  If you a gay man or anyone who enjoys a sexy read be sure and get this latest copy.  It's too hot to handle!!!!!!	2001-01-12

It's one of the most touching stories I have read in a long while.  It was a nice change.  \\"Wyoming\\" tells the story of a mother and her young 9 year old son, Roy, who travel together by car through the south and mid-west United States during the 1950's.  There trip to \\"Wyoming\\" exists as a state of mind rather than an actual place.  The story is told entirely in dialogue, where they both discuss their lives, hopes and dreams.  <br />I thought the questions the son asks on the trip were the same type all children ask when we are young, inquisitive, and innocent.  We view the world at that age as a wonderful place full of surprises and many mysteries..  The author brought this out in little Roy in a wonderful way.  This mother and son were two people you would really want to know.  When Roy asks questions like: \\"Mom, when birds die, what happens to their souls?\\" or \\"What would happen if there was no sun?\\" and \\"Mom, after I die I want to come back as a flamingo\\" who could not love this little boy?  For the short time it takes to read this wonderful story, it's more than worth the effort.  Highly recommended!	2001-01-11

This is a little 6\\" X 6\\" case-bound book that I bought for myself and now plan on giving as gifts to all my friends.  Every gay household should have one on display.  What with all the erotic colored drawings that reminded me of Tom of Finland's work, this is a sexy little book.  Each letter of the alphabet from A-Z holds the key to hot and funny scenes of gay sex.  Maurice Vellekoop is a wonderful artist and has written very funny lines here.  I really enjoyed this book.  My advise is to get your copy now before you forget &amp; or it goes out of print.	2001-01-11

In fact, I read \\"Limits of Justice\\" first and have been backtracking.  So I can honestly say this second mystery following \\"Simple Justice\\" is not my favorite.   However, I really did enjoy the story because the author writes with a style that draws you in with a skill that makes you read right thru not wanting to stop till you get to the end.   The story centers around a dead man, Raymond Farr, and how anyone at this Hollywood party might have wanted him dead.  Justice begins to nose around and unearths a web of relationships, that finally lead him to the killer.  I thought the story dealt very emotionally with Ben's feelings for AIDS stricken Danny Romero, a subject in the murder, and his effort to clear his name in the murder.   The ending, yes, was a little obvious, and the murderer easy to figure out, but it's still an interesting read, and very enjoyable.  I am glad I read this second mystery by John Wilson, and would recommend all four of his mysteries to anyone.	2001-01-09

I thought these black &amp; white photographs by James Houston of male &amp; female models were beautifully done.  These images of the human body featured as sculptural forms interacting with the natural environment are very tasteful, artistic and classically photographed.  There are more male images shown than female.   The lighting and shadows cast on these well developed muscular bodies show us what a talented and inventive photographer James Houston really is.  A native of Sydney, Australia, Mr. Houston's work has won many awards, and you can see why when you view these beautiful photos in this book.  These photographs were taken over a period of five years all over the world.  <br />I enjoyed this book, and know it will share a special place in my collection.  This book should appeal to both male and female's who collect &amp; enjoy nude studies of the human body.	2001-01-03

This is a fascinating book that takes a different look at the \\"Great War\\" told from the angle of a young man with a great talent who uses it to help make a great sacrifice for the sake of art, risking his own identity and perhaps his own life.  So many stories of WWII have been told from the military standpoint, it was great to read an account of bravery from a civilian viewpoint.  <br />Paul Watkin's narrator David Halifax, the young artist, tells the story in a very descriptive &amp; detailed way.  I could envision Paris and the surrounding countryside very easily.  This portrait of the young artist really taught me a lot about fine art I didn't know or realize before.  If you enjoy beautiful art &amp; paintings you'll find the details about forgery fascinating and eye-opening.  There is so much happening in this story you just can't help but read on.  A truly enjoyable and emotional read.	2000-12-29

I thought this new book of male nude photography featuring 90 of the best photographers of today and the past was a good overview of the history of male nude photography.  It offers a biography of each photographer and an analysis of each photograph which I thought was very helpful.  There were many photographer's I had no knowledge of before.  It's sort of a reference book you can turn to and find out about your favorite photographer, and learn a little bit about his or her work and career.  Men and women are both represented in this book, which is unusual in male nude photography books, usually only men are represented.  If I had one problem with this book it's the fact that only one photograph for each photographer is shown.  I wish there had been at least two examples or more.  However, I think the book would have been too big, if more than one image was presented and in addition 90 photographer's is a large number to showcase in one volume.  Maybe a Volume 1 &amp; Volume II would have helped.<br />Philip Braham did a great job in putting together this very informative book, and I enjoyed it.  It's certainly a good source of information on male nude photography to have in your collection, and to display on that coffee-table.	2000-12-22

Over the years I have collected everything I can about George Platt Lynes career as a photographer. As a true admirer of his wonderful black &amp; white photography I feel this is a wonderful new addition published by Taschen.  It's a beautiful over-sized book with over 240 pages of beautifully reproduced photos of his many different images.  The book is broken down into five sections; Portraits, Ballet, Nudes, Fashion and Mythology.  I especially enjoyed his ballet photos, fashion and nude images.  Each section has a detailed history of each photography subject.  <br />It's a great history of his career.  There is a detailed biography by David Leddick that is excellent.  It's very informative and helpful if you are not familiar with Lynes work, or if you are just refreshing your knowledge of this man's great photography from the 30's &amp; 40's.  There was a certain innocent and raw beauty in photography back then that makes these images of his very classic.  Lynes use of shadows and light make his models come right at you, in such stark realistic fashion.  <br />This book would make a great gift, or a great addition to your collection, or coffee-table.

I was a little disappointed with this collection of Swiss photographer Karlheinz Weinberger's work because I expected more photos from the 1950's that he published under the pseudonym \\"Jim\\" for the gay magazine Der Kreis.  There is only  a small section of about 20 pages devoted to his gay photography for this magazine.  However, what black &amp; white photos there are of his gay models are very good.  The rest of the book is broken down into sections showcasing his involvement with rebels-1960's Zurich youth that were rebelling (like the youth in America) against the established authority, and sections on Rockers and Bikers (Hell Angels, etc.).  This book is filled with wonderful black &amp; white, and many large color shots of the youth (male &amp; female) from that era.  It is a great look back into the history of the confused and turbulent 1960's.  The introductions are a great asset and help in explaining the photos of Karlheinz. <br />Karlheinz had a unique way of capturing real people in natural surroundings, in provocative and sometimes humorous situations that will live on in history because of his special talent.  I learned a lot about this Zurich photographer I didn't know already, so I can say I'm better off than I was before I bought this book.  I just wish they would have included more of his work from the time he started in1948 at Der Kreis.	2000-12-14

It's a small book, but a very complex story, that goes back and forth in time, where it may seem confusing at times but by the end it all falls into place.  It was at this point I found myself saying this book would make a great movie.  It involves two friends Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf who are from Amsterdam.  The story weaves from between the time they meet  at camp on vacation at the age of fourteen through the years to adulthood.  Axel becomes such a part of Egon's whole life, always seeming to turn up at the most crucial times.  It's a story of unforgettable characters and betrayal in the deepest sense. I felt sorry for Egon, his life seemed so controlled in so many ways by this one man, Axel.  <br />I really enjoyed Tim Krabbe's writing, it makes you really pay attention.  It's the type of book you want to read again to make sure you didn't miss anything, like a movie that you seem to learn more about every time you watch it again.  Now I know why this was a bestseller in the Netherlands.	2000-12-13

James Spada is the author of sixteen books which include biographies of famous stars, and pictorial biographies (\\"Life in Pictures\\" ) of famous people that have made him world renowned.  He has now turned his creativity to photographing the nude male.  \\"Black &amp; White Men\\" is his latest collection of photos, and it is exactly what it claims to be, black &amp; white shots of young good-looking male models posed in very erotic and sensual poses.  Spada captures natural light as it casts moody shadows on these well-developed bodies.  Shane was my favorite model.  I guess that's why he was made the cover model, someone felt the same way I did.  You can tell James Spada has a relaxed and good relationship with his models, they all seem so at ease and uninhibited.  <br />This book is over 90 pages, and that's my only regret.  I just wish it could have been a more extensive selection of his images.  I would recommend this collection of 60 images to anyone who enjoys male nude photography from a inspiring new photographer.!	2000-12-08

This beautiful produced book , accompanying a major exhibition at the new Museum of Contemporary Art, in New York, is a wonderful introduction for anyone to Pierre &amp; Gilles beautiful &amp; unique combination of photography and painting.  I have been a fan of Pierre &amp; Gilles for many years, and have enjoyed all of the wonderful collection of books published about them over the years, but this book was indeed welcomed because it has a lot of their new unpublished  photographic paintings.  Art critic &amp; curator, Dan Cameron, gives a great overview &amp; history of Pierre &amp; Gille's photographic paintings as well as a complete explanation of all of the images presented in this book.  It's very insightful and I learned a lot more than I knew before.  <br />So if you are a true fan of Pierre &amp; Gilles work you definitely should have this beautiful book in your collection, or if their work is new to you this is one of the best introductions to their talented and very unique photography.	2000-12-07

I was really impressed with this new book of black &amp; white &amp; sepia-tone photographs of nude male models by four leading photographers who are not as  well-known as some of the top professional photographers (Weber, Ritts, Gorman, etc) we all know today, but who should be.  \\"Man\\" is a stunning collection of beautiful photographs showcasing these four photographers who all have their very own individual style.  There are over 150 pages of photographs presented here, a section for each artist.<br />Za-Hazzanani's photographs I found to be my favorite.  She has a unique way of using the right lighting and of posing the models in such a way that they are very erotic and pleasing to the senses.  That's not to say I didn't enjoy the other photographers images.  Tony Butcher's beautiful photographs of nude black males are truly stunning, and his work reminds me a lot of Mapplethorpe's.  Trevor Watson also showcases many black male models using light and shadows to highlight and sensual his images in just the right way.  Toni Catany uses old calotype printing techniques which give his photographs of the nude male body intensity and a moody texture that makes them all seem like old photographs.  <br />There is a wonderful introduction by Paul Ryan who gives a history of the development of male nude photography and it's gradual acceptance over the years.  You'll also find a section of biographical notes on all the photographer's featured in this book.  I enjoyed this collection from these four photographers I didn't know before, and this was a welcome introduction to their work.  This is a frank and honest presentation of nude male models shown in a different and sexy way!	2000-12-07

I have read all of his other wonderful books (Truth Serum, Maps to Anywhere, &amp; A Year of Rhymes) but this is by far my favorite.  This is an exquisite collection of short stories that are so full of passion &amp; humanity.  They can be sad and heart-breaking but also very funny all at the same time.  In other words, these stories have so many different emotions in them that you can't help but be moved and enjoy them.  <br />In \\"Hunters and Gatherers\\", a Mormon couple have a party game while hosting a dinner for a few gays that they know.  This couple is odd, and what they make their guests do is really funny.  I was so touched by \\"Exterior Decoration\\" a story that dealt with Ray &amp; Cliff's relationship in the face of AIDS.  The story was so heartbreaking yet it was so funny at the same time.  Bernard Cooper has a way of bringing out all the emotions you could possible feel, but when you are done reading his stories, you won't feel unhappy, you'll feel very satisfied &amp; fulfilled.  I wish I could tell you all about \\"Old Birds\\", but I can't!  Wait till you read this, it is so funny!  When I read this story my parrot was sitting with me, and looking at me like I was crazy, because I was laughing out loud so hard.  What a story!!<br />Guess Again is unlike any other book you have read before.  It gets my highest recommendation.  Make sure you read this great book!!	2000-12-06

When I first started reading this story I didn't know whether I wanted to finish it or not, but I forged on and by the time I got to Page 387, I was glad I did.  David it is a great story teller, who really knows how to write in great detail.  He writes like he's having a conversation with you, and that is very relaxing especially if you don't mind spending a lot of time with him.  This story centering around Martin, the narrator, and Eli (his boyfriend) and Liza takes place in the 80's and covers their lives as writers just starting out in the complex publishing world.  A lot of the story I believe is autobiographical but that really doesn't matter at all, unless you were part of the New York scene at that time and personally knew these people.  I, myself, enjoyed learning a little more about the ins and outs of the publishing world as explained in this story.  This story was very touching, and funny at times.   I just wish the conclusion would have taken the story a few years more into the future.  But who know, maybe there will be a sequel.<br />If you have enjoyed David's other books (Lost Language of Cranes &amp; While England Sleeps) you'll like this one.  I know I did.  This is a story that is well written from an author who will be one of our literary giants for a long time to come.	2000-12-02

These are stunning color photographs from Lorenzo Gomez of beautiful muscular &amp; handsome \\"Real\\" men.  This is a large (approximately 10 X12in.) format book beautifully produced.  These are not your young, lithe bodied models found in most books today, but very masculine, muscular, large men who are very erotically posed in outdoor settings.  Lorenzo knows how to show the sensual, erotic attitudes of these men without using full frontal-nudity.  Posed in briefs, torn jeans, etc, they leave a lasting impression.  <br />I liked the large full colored pages in this book.  Lorenzo Gomez is a fine photographer with a eye for capturing the beauty of the male nude form.  I highly recommend this beautiful book of Latin Men.	2000-11-30

Reed Massengill started photographing Brian Hess in 1992 at the age of 18.  Over the next nine years Massengill photographed this model's coming of age and physical transformation, from a young man to a mature independent man.  Over the years they became very good friends.  This is a very different kind of diary showing how radically Brian changed over the years, and how he changed physically by adding tattoos, piercings, and scarifications on his body.  <br />Brian is a very handsome young man, which adds to the wonderful photos Reed did over the 9 years.  The photos can be very serious, introspective, fun, and very erotic indeed.  I really enjoyed this book because it's always fascinating to see the changes people go through over the years.  Brian changed so much in appearance but basically remains a very handsome man.  If you like Brian's looks you'll love this book, but even if you don't it a very interesting photographic study. Well done!!	2000-11-29

They deal with gay relationships, adolescence, and out of control drug addiction.  These subjects are dealt with in such an honest, clear and edgy way.  The lives of these unconventional characters are brought to the page so intensely with all their flaws clearly exposed.  You'll feel their thoughts and feelings.  The artistic language used in this book make it a pleasure to read right through to the last page.  No matter how dark and trashy these characters get you'll want to read more. <br />This was my first introduction to the author's writings (thanks,Sheldon) and I  truly enjoyed this book.  I think what really made this book special was the poetry in-between the essays and fiction.  These poems were so easy to read and what I mean by that is they were very understandable.  You don't have to spend all day figuring out what the author is trying to say.  They are a joy to read.  I look forward to this author's future work.  Highly recommended.	2000-11-28

This is a small book with a lot of information.  There is a handsome male photo to start each chapter, which alone is enough to buy the book.  Some of these lines will make you laugh and others will surely provoke you.  <br />I love these quote books because they are so entertaining, easy to read and a relaxing get-away.  Read them alone, or it's great to get together with a group of friends and enjoy them.  Whatever you do don't miss this book!	2000-11-23

These are real people who happened to be gay, or even straight.  C. Bard Cole has written individual stories, about named individuals that are edgy, brash, and very insightful.  The stories are about sex workers, punks, and characters from all  different backgrounds which includes teens to rich college boys.  <br />I found this to be an intensely rewarding read because it was so different from the \\"normal\\" writing be put out there by the mainstream gay literary giants.  This is a fresh and different type of writing.  Each story was a brief history into the life of the character.  This is a exciting debut for Cole and I really enjoyed this new author.  The drawings and illustrations were an added bonus.  If you want to read a book that it different and that will stir you try this one.	2000-11-22

I wasn't disappointed, this book is long over-due!  What memories these images bring back to me, the runways, the fashion shows, the anxiety, the backstage rush and confusion and the rewards of showing the latest fashions.  It's a unique experience like no other.<br />New York photographer Patrick McMullan has taken some wonderful behind the scenes photos of male fashion shows.  These are candid poses of the guys,  getting ready for the shows, and some of them really acting up for the camera.  McMullan is a pro at capturing honest photos of these handsome young men.  He is well-known for his party photos published in many magazines.  <br />This is a large format book, with large beautiful photographs.  If you often wondered what it must be like backstage at these male fashion shows, then you should definitely buy this book for your collection.  I'm glad I did.  Wonderful!!!	2000-11-21

There are 11 loosely linked stories in this collection that tracks a former farm boy from the Florida swamps to his growing up and dealing with fearful and blundering romances.  In fact, most of these stories deal with the main characters fear in almost everything.  These stories can be funny at times, and yet very erotic.  Tester has a way of really exposing his characters for who they really are, and  by the way he uses language in each sentence you know right away the narrator has a stutter.  Two of the stories I really enjoyed were:\\"The Living and the Dead\\" about a gay drifter who hooks up with a rich young Italian in the shadow of the Vatican, and \\"Floridita\\" about a mother and her three children listening to audiotapes sent home from Vietnam by their soldier-father.  \\"Floridita\\" brought back memories of sending my own tapes back home to my parents when I was serving in Vietnam.   <br />At first I didn't think I was going to enjoy this book, but you'll find as you read further and further into this book, you'll really enjoy these stories.

If you're a fan of Kristen Bjorn's many, many, hot erotic movies, you'll love this book.  If you also like dark, sultry, and exotic looking real men you will love this book.  There are no young, boyish looking guys in this collection.  It's a large hardcover book which is a welcome change with well over 110 large color photos of very well endowed men.  Kristen, once a model and all-male film star himself knows how to find the hottest men.  My favorite shot is of the two good-looking men holding each other while over-looking the city.  Although I thought a lot of these photo shots seemed a little over-posed, that shouldn't stop any Bjorn fan from enjoying this book.  I guess I'm spoiled from the live action in all his videos.  This is a great book, though, and brings to the printed page some of his best and hottest models.	2000-11-17

Can this be based on his own life, or is it just more fiction and not really fact?  We really don't know when we are done reading this book, but what a wonderful experience it is.  Maupin's books are always full of surprises, and this one is no exception.  If you want closure when you read this book, you are going to be disappointed. However, that can be good because when you're done reading this book, you're going to be really thinking and wondering for a long time about the details of this story, and that's the sign of a great book that you're not going to forget.  There is nothing predictable here, and I promise you that you won't be able to put the book down till you're finished. I didn't.  It's a very touching story, full of emotion, and lots of love.  Gabriel Noone's emotional relationship in helping an ailing thirteen year old boy, Pete Lomax, who has suffered terrible abuse by the hands of his parents, is a very moving story.  <br />Armistead Maupin is one of the best authors we have today.

It's like going back in time to view these photographic images of young males from the 60's and 70's.  I am so glad that this first collection of Mel Roberts' work is finally in print.  These images of young men were taken at a time when no one was pressured to be defined as gay, straight or anything else, just who they were.  It was a time of change, experimentation in love, as well as life-styles.  These decades were a time of love and great change for all of us.   Some of these young men are nude and very handsome, but the most interesting photos are of the men in the style of clothing for that period of time; tight white pants, sailor outfits, really short-shorts, paisley prints, jeans and leather.  You'll find your average guy next door here, and your drop-dead handsome guy who should be in movies.  <br />Mel Roberts began photographing models toward the end of the classic physique period in 1959.  He wanted to show the male model in a natural environment and that's where you will find all of these models posing in this book.  He felt man is part of nature.  There is a wonderful introduction to this volume covering the photographic career of this unique photographer that  developed over a period of 20 years.  This is a wonderful look at this time period of male photography especially if you grew up at this time and were part of that generation.  These color photographs are like sitting and looking at someone's personal photo album.  So different than the all the other male photography books on the market.    A rare treat.  I hope he releases more photos in future editions.  This is a very limited edition that should be part of your collection.  Fascinating!!!	2000-11-16

The photos in this book are so beautifully reproduced, I don't think I have ever seen better.  The book binding itself from the brown cloth cover to the beautiful sepia tone black &amp; white photos is perfect.  The images of these models (Gorman's friends, acquaintances, and professional models) are so sensual and so clear because of Gorman's talented use of light and shadows.  These hot men are handsome and good-looking.  There are over 240 photos in this collection, a great achievement that was 20 years in the making by this photographer.  These young men are not big and overly built, but very natural looking young men.  As Gorman says, \\"They are not really boys, yet they're not really men, either.<br />Anyone who appreciates male beauty, great photography, or both should own this beautiful collection.  I have reviewed and collected many male nude photography books, but I was more than impressed with this book.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  It's a must for the collector of male figure study books.	2000-11-15

It's really interesting to look at old photographs and imagine times gone by, what it was like to live at that time, and what the people in the photos were really like.  Sailor has gathered together in one book over 150 never-before published snapshots of sailors and portraits spanning over a century of time.  If you ever dreamed of being a sailor you will find these photos fascinating.  The youthful men, the masculine exuberance,  &amp; companionship shown in these black &amp; white and sepia-tone snapshots are a peak into a sailor's real life.  If we could only stay as youthful and handsome all our lives as these photos show, how wonderful  that would be. <br />So if you're a lover of old photos, or a serious collector, or if you just enjoy looking at men in uniform, you will enjoy this book.  I felt like I was looking through an older friends personal photo album.  Kevin Bentley did a wonderful job in gathering together these old anonymous photos, and the book design by J. White is perfect.  I really enjoyed this collection of photos.	2000-11-14

I really enjoyed this third Benjamin Justice novel.  Ben is such a wonderful character, and now that he has turned 40, things are looking up for him.  He's got a new job at a Public Broadcasting Station writing a documentary series on AIDS and bare-back riding, a very controversial new trend.  Justice and his new associate producer go looking for the episode's producer, Tommy Callahan, who hasn't been heard from in over a week.  Tommy is later found murdered.  It's from this point on in the story that Ben gets involved in solving this mystery, and his life gets turned upside down, and backwards.  At the same time, Ben is struggling with his love life, infatuated with Peter, the associate producer ( a blond beauty) and Oree, a sophisticated gentlemen more his own age.  <br />There's always plenty of surprises in John Wilson's novels, and this one is one of his best.  You just can't wait to get to the end to find out how everything is going to turn out.  And the characters are always so well-developed you feel like they could be your friends.  I read his last mystery, \\"The Limits of Justice\\" first, so now I am working on his previous three.  It's best if you can start from his first one, and read the whole series in order, although each book stands on its own.  If you like mysteries, you'll really enjoy this one, I did.	2000-11-10

Fred Goudon's new photography book is a stunning display of very attractive, relaxed sensual male nude models photographed in black and white.  A lot of the models are photographed lying in bed alone, or in couples,  and getting ready for bed, etc., thus establishing the theme of the book.  Fred has a way of presenting his male models in a moody, relaxed way.  These guys are not your standard run of the mill very posed male models.  There is some frontal nudity but that's not really important here, because these models are very attractive even with half their clothes on.   I really enjoyed this book because I feel there is so much more feeling and emotion in black and white photography than in color shots.  <br />Fred Goudon was born in Cannes in the south of France back in 1965.  He left Cannes in the 80's for Los Angeles  to work as a press correspondent for magazines and newspapers.  This is when he started photographing male models.  He went back to France where he now lives, and continues to work as a fashion &amp; commercial photographer.  This was my first introduction to Fred Goudon's work and I really enjoyed this excellent edition of his work put out by Bruno Gmunder.	2000-11-09

This is a stunning novel about the adventures of two boys who write comic books during what was known as the Golden Age of comic books in the 1930's.  This book about Joe, Sammy, and Rosa and their lives spans continents, eras, and many years of love and much hardship.  The details of their lives is written in such beautiful language it makes you feel you are living in this time period.  I have never been so involved in what I was reading as I was in this book, all 636 pages of it.  It's a long story but one you will think about long after you have finished it.  The characters you will never forget.  So I guess I am saying Michael Chabon is a brilliant writer, who can certainly capture the attention of his readers.  He has a florid way of writing and I really enjoyed that.  <br />I was never a great reader of comic books, but you don't have to be to enjoy this book.  I could go on and on about the story, but you just have to read the book description for that.  It's all there.  I would highly recommend this wonderful book if you have the time to read it.  You'll find yourself staying up late till you reach the last chapter.  What a great movie this would make.  I really enjoyed Michael Chabon's other three novels, but I think this is his best yet.	2000-11-03

I usually like black and white photography better because I believe it has more feeling, but this new collection of Ron William's is breathtaking in its exciting photos of men in outdoor surroundings.  I especially enjoyed models, \\"Federico, Aaron &amp; Carlos.\\"  What handsome &amp; masculine men they are.  Most models are photographed in swimwear, shorts, jeans &amp; underwear.  There is no need for frontal nudity, the men are much more erotic  shown this way.<br />Ron Williams is an Emmy Award winning director living in Miami, who has created many corporate commercials in the last 20 years.  He is well-known for his VistaMen  series of physique art videos showcasing many stunning sensual men who are physique models.  I really enjoyed this book &amp; hope to see more books published of his fine photography in the near future.	2000-11-02

Kristen Bjorn is known today for his many erotic all male videos, showcasing men from all over the world.  This new postcard book, number 23 in the series of fine photographers, is another one to add to the collection.  It's a must if you already own his latest photography book, \\"Men of Kristen Bjorn.\\"  These postcards will be appreciated by your friends who receive them.  Or keep them as part of your collection, if you own all the other ones.  The photographs of these sensual men are stunning, as can always be expected from this talented photographer.  Truly enjoyable for the male erotic nude collector.	2000-11-02

Mark Salzman has been gifted with the ability to be able to write beautiful stories that are a joy to read and always insightful and socially relevant.  If you have read his other two novels, \\"The Laughing Sutra &amp; The Soloist, plus \\"Iron &amp; Silk\\", his account of two years in China, and his memoir \\"Lost in Place\\" you'll know what I mean. <br />This time he presents us with a wonderful story about the life of Sister John of the Cross serving God in a Carmelite monastery outside present-day Los Angeles.  When she experiences visions that are accompanied by migraine headaches, a doctor feels they may be dangerous, and this is when she must make a devastating choice.  Are her spiritual gifts just symptoms of illness rather than visions of divine grace, and will a cure mean she will lose her visions and become just a lost soul again searching?  <br />The day to day religious life of these sisters is brought to life in such heart-felt detail  and accuracy.  You actually feel you are a part of Sister John's life, hoping and praying for her in her struggles.  This may be a short read but when you are done you'll feel you experienced a lifetime of existence with these wonderful nuns.  I think everyone can enjoy this wonderful book whether you are religious or not.  I certainly did.  I always look forward to Mark Salzman's next book, I haven't been disappointed yet.  Its like a small miracle.	2000-10-27

Diamond Dogs is a wonderful work of fiction you can't put down from the moment you read the first page.  Alan Watt has written an exciting, non-stop story centering around a hit and run accident and its subsequent cover-up.  A wonderful suspenseful tale of a mixed-up but loving relationship between father and son.  <br />High School quarterback Neil Garvin, a much-worshipped high school football star narrates the story.  It's thru his eyes that the whole story enfolds, and you quickly realize that teenagers today are much more mature than we give them credit for.  It's over the course of the next three days following the accident that Neil's life is completely changed  when his father, the sheriff, helps cover-up the accident.  We become a participant in the events that follow, whether we like it or not, and we get drawn into the complexities of small-town life, and father and son bonding.  <br />Whether it takes you a few hours, a day, or 2 days, this is a book you won't forget.  A very promising debut novel from this author.  An easy read that will keep you very entertained.  Bravo!!	2000-10-21

You think you know how it's going to turn out,  but then you question it, and then you think you know again, but change your mind several more times before you finally find out.  My only complaint might be that the ending was summed up too quickly in the last chapter, when the story could have went on for several more chapters.  I had the feeling the book had to be cut short for some reason.  However, that's my only complaint about this book, because this is the type of story where you can become very involved with the characters and really get to care about them.  You can tell the author Andy Schell is a man of the theater.  He knows how to write and keep his audience involved.  <br />This story involves Harry Ford who is gay, but needs to find a wife before his next birthday in order to inherit his family's fortune.  A stipulation his father made in his will before he died.  He wanted to make sure his gay son was out of the will.  Enter Amity Stone, who becomes Harry's roommate and savior who will marry him and have a platonic relationship with him to secure the inheritance.  But little did Harry know he would meet Nicolo, a hunky Argentinean, who he falls in love with, which creates a real dilemma.  What happens from this point on will keep you glued to the book, and guessing the outcome.  <br />A wonderful debut novel and hopefully there will be more stories from Andy Schell to enjoy.  I really enjoyed this fast-paced novel.	2000-10-18

This was my first exposure to Philip Hitchcock's sculptures, and I was  impressed.  They are so lifelike you feel you are looking at real male models or photographs of live models.  What a talented, brilliant sculptor.  <br />This book is a work of art in itself.  Anyone interested in the human form, especially male models will find this book fascinating.  The color reproductions are excellent.  Ellis Productions did a wonderful job in designing this book.  Dark Impressions is very erotic, sometimes disturbing, shown with sculptures (models) that are  in restraints, hardware, with skulls, ropes and horns; casted in resin, steel and copper.  <br />This is a wonderful introduction to Philip Hitchcock's very original and awe-inspiring talent as a sculpturer.  I loved this book and hope to obtain someday one of these sculpture's for myself.  There is even a section about the processing of casting from \\"Life.\\"  A fascinating process shown with photos.  If you are an art lover, or if you just appreciate the beauty of the human body, you will love this book.  I certainly did.	2000-10-17

The theme is a day at the beach on a warm summer's day, where all the guys seem to be enjoying each other's friendship.  All these photos are in black and white, some nude, lots in bathing suits, lots of nude butt shots, but no frontal nudes.  There are lots of couples in erotic poses, and lots of group shots around the beach and water.  <br />I enjoyed this new collection very much, although it seemed like an ad for 2(x)ist underwear at times, but that's fine, because that's my favorite brand.  There is a companion story by Ernesto Mestre-Reed which is suppose to capture the physical joy in Morgan's photographs.  I didn't see the connection that much myself.  Maybe I am not in the same mind-frame as the author or didn't get the connection that was intended.  I don't know.  It was a cute little story, though. All in all a beautiful book, by a photographer who knows how to capture the beauty in the male nude body.  If you enjoy viewing mature muscular male nudes, you should enjoy this book.	2000-10-15

When I first starting reading this book, I thought the life of these characters was just too wonderful.  How can anyone's life be this plain and perfect.  But that's the attraction and what makes this story seem like a sweet story from the distant past when things were so much more calmer and families really stayed together.  If we could only all show so much innocense and love for each other today.<br />\\"Jim the Boy\\" tells the story of a young boy named Jim, coming of age, in a very remote and peaceful North Carolina town.  It's 1934 and during the depression.  Jim's father has been dead 10 years now, and his 3 wonderful uncles are now his mentors, who deeply care for Jim and their sister Cissy.  The story from this point on tells of Jim's everyday adventures, and feelings while growing up.  <br />Tony Earley's beautiful descriptions of this time period, small town life, and everyday surroundings are indeed poetic.  It's like a breath of fresh air in the countryside, and I mean rural countryside.  It's nice to settle back, relax, and fantazise about an earlier peaceful time when people lived so differently than we do now.  A truly wonderful book.	2000-10-14

If it wasn't for Amazon's Quick Picks, I would never have discovered this author and this great mystery story.  After checking the book out on my Amazon Quick Pick List I couldn't wait to read it.  I am glad I did because I read this book in one day, it was that interesting and so hard to put down.  I will be sure and read his previous three mysteries.  <br />\\"The Limits Of Justice\\" tells the story of Charlotte, daughter of TV and movie star Rod Preston, who wants an unauthorized biography stopped about her father..  Private Investigator Benjamin Justice gets on the case, and then Charlotte is found dead.  The story goes on to reveal a network of pedophiles and secrets that are too horrible to imagine.  This is a very engaging read and keeps you glued to your seat till the very end.  His description of the Southern California region and its history, as well as Mexico, is surely educational and enlightening if you are not too familiar with this area.  A book worth exploring!	2000-10-13

I really enjoyed this second volume of Gay Erotic Art Photography? from Leonard Zett.  There are more butts here than you could imagine.  The color, lighting, and positions of these male erotic images is fascinating.  It's hard to believe that some of these images weren't computer enhanced, instead of just images multiplied, and duplicated from videos images.  Again, if you are expecting full body shots, or facials, forget it.  There is just butts, butts, butts.  I couldn't resist that.  <br />Between \\"Penissimo\\" and this second volume \\"Buttissimo\\" (limited edition) Mr. Zett has showed what a unique mind and talent he has.  I am sure this and Volume 1 will be a permanent part of my collection.  It's a pleasant change to some new ideas in male nude photography.	2000-10-12

Is this book photography, erotic art, or just plain pornography?  I really can't say.  You could just call it pure gay sex in photography.  I think Leonard Zett has created a uniquely different art with these photos of penises.  He has taken images of penises from videos or directly from his own videos and created new ones by duplicating them, changing colors, and multiplying and also reducing the images.  I think he must have had a lot of fun in doing this.  Don't expect facial shots or bodies, (although there are a few), these are just penises glorified to the fullest.   No computer techniques were used at all to create these images.  <br />I really enjoyed this book because it was different from other photography books.  Leonard Zett shows he is quite talented with a very creative mind to produce images like these.  And remember this is a limited edition book which should add value to your collection.  Be sure and check out his other volume of male erotic objects of desire called \\"Buttissimo.\\"	2000-10-11

It's a true celebration of the athletic, muscular beauty of the male body.  These photos are perfect creations that have been aided by the help of the computer, to present a dramatic view (background, lighting, etc) that is truly an art form in itself.  These models are very beautiful, handsome muscular men, (no full frontal nudes) who are truly at that age of body perfection.  Many shots are of singular men and there are many couples in erotic embraces.<br />Ed Freeman was born and raised in New England.His erotic photos and images have been published in many books, magazines, calendars, and posters everywhere.  I am so glad that he has finally published his own book.  This is one of the best books of male nudes (in both content and appearance) that I have seen in a long time.  As a collector of male nude photography books this one is a must for your collection.	2000-10-08

Real contains letters between Dodie Bellamy (Mina Harker) and Sam D'Allesandro; a story that was taped by Sam before he died in 1988; and a long very emotional, heartbreaking letter by Dodie that concerns the subject of death.  <br />Being a fan of Sam D'Allesandro's writing ever since he wrote \\"Zombie Pit\\", I was so thankful to discover this wonderful little book , recommended by a kind literary friend, S.  I started this book in the afternoon and didn't stop till I was finished in the early evening.  The letters between Sam and Mina are fascinating to read,  whether they are true or not.  It was nice to learn Sam's real name.  A lot of Sam's experiences I could relate to from my own life during the same time period.  There's a lot of writing on sex and death, especially AIDS.  <br />There's a wonderful preface included by another great writer of that time period, Robert Gluck.  Dodie has been credited with creating this new narrative style, making the novel more real, and her correspondents could thus present the fictional part of themselves, their personalities.  <br />If you want a wonderful literary book to read,  be sure and secure a copy of this book.  I just wish Sam was around to bring us more joy from his writing.  We miss him like so many other writers we have lost to AIDS.   What more can I say!	2000-10-07

The story is told from the perspective of a 14 year old deaf-mute teenager fleeing his abusive father and taking to the road with a gay friend named Jonnyboy, an older mentor who becomes the only person \\"Radboy\\" (as Jonnyboy calls him) can trust.  They meet three other people,  boyfriends Critter and Finn, and Ula, a female with a vengeance of her own.  There's lots of drugs, some sex, and violent events to keep you wondering where all this is going to end.  <br />Once you get use to the hyper way this story is written in short sentences, you will get right in the beat of the story.  So don't be put off by the first few pages, push on and you will soon be flowing right through to the end.  For a first novel, Kief Hillsbery has given us a exciting, very human, hypnotic story.   Forget what you were taught in school about proper grammar, this is an enlightening new breed of novel.  An engrossing new literary voice has been born.  I look forward to Kief's next book.	2000-10-06

Most of these stories are about childhood, growing up, and becoming mature adults.  A lot of these stories will make you look back on your own life growing up as a child and all the experiences that that can entail.  The author's sentences are thoughtfully written and in a very stylistic way.  I was unhappy to see the book end, especially after reading the very emotional last story \\"Come Live with Me and Be My Love\\", about a middle-age man looking back on his 30 year arranged marriage.  This was a truly touching story.  <br />I recommend this very human collection of stories.  A great debut collection from Mr. Greer.  I just hope there is more to come soon.  He has a great elegant and poetic style of writing.	2000-10-05

Matthew Stadler is probably one of the most gifted young novelists writing today.   Even though his books are disturbing, they have a way of captivating you so  that you can't wait to read the book right through.  I lost some sleep over  this one.  <br />This is the story of a young teacher's journey to Paris to  uncover the sad history of Gertrude Stein's troubled nephew Allan.  The  teacher travels to Paris under an assumed name, after being fired from his  job because of a sex scandal.  In Paris he becomes enchanted and obsessed  with a 15 year old boy.  Thus the story continues from there.... Forget the  pedophiliac part of the story, this should not frighten you away from  Matthew Stadler's excellent writing &amp; descriptions of this time and  place.  His writing is so elegant at times its like reading a classic or it  will be in time.  <br />Whether he is shocking the reader, or enticing us with  beautiful prose, Matthew Stadler, certainly know how to keep a reader's  attention, and take you places you might not dare go alone.  This is  perhaps his best book yet.	2000-09-20

What a work  of \\"Art\\" in itself, from its pink cover to the beautiful photos inside.   James Bidgood is considered the father of the gay pulp and glamour  aesthetic.  An American photographer in the 50's who transformed his  apartment into a fantasy land to photograph these beautiful boys.  This  book is just crammed with photos of beautiful young men.  Included are  essays explaining his life and these photographs.  Some may consider these  photos campy, but they have a beauty and style that was really unique to  that period and time.  James Bidgood was also the director of the  homoerotic film \\"Pink Narcissus\\" in the 70's.  <br />This is a definite must  for your collection.  A very sensual and emotional book of beautiful  photographs.  Highly recommended.	2000-09-19

What a  screwed-up life Earl's lives, the retarded gay hustler in his early 20's  who chases after this guy named \\"Red\\", another hustler who has AIDS.  Earl  doesn't know it's love he is feeling for Red, and is so nave, he doesn't  even know how to please the john's that he entertains at Madam's.  What an  engrossing story, its so sad, dark,  and touching.  You want to reach out  and help Earl get past the drugs, johns, and awful life he's living.  WHAT  a book to become absorbed in.  The author really makes you feel for Earl.   The books seems too short and makes you wish it was longer.  It's hard to  stop reading and put this book down; forget the chores and errands.  This  is a story that will be on your mind long after reading it.  My highest  recommendation, really enjoyable.	2000-09-17

Naked is another collection of his funny stories about everyday  living and truly a funny book.  I really enjoyed it, maybe not as much as  \\"Talk Pretty\\" but it was almost equal.

His  adventures lead him to New York City and even to Haiti.  Some of the scenes  he enters into are pretty wild, shocking and abusive, with homosexual S/M  thrown in.  I had the feeling I was reading one of Dennis Cooper's books at  times.

It's the story of  four young friends; Stephen, Greg, Meredith, and Brandon growing up in New  Orleans, and how their lives are pulled in different directions as they  grow up, enter high school, and drift apart.  What an imagination this  author has as there is everything in this book, including murder, suicide,  and an unexpected ending.  I thought the character of Stephen was well  written and one that many young gay men can sympathize with because he is  treated as an outcast by his friends in a school that viciously mocks him  and makes his life miserable.  Chris has written a book that makes you care  about the characters, wonder what's going to happen to them next, and draws  you right to the ending, non-stop, wishing and hoping there was more to  learn and read about these people.  In other words, you don't want the  story to end, or to say goodbye to these people you have come to know.  A  wonderful debut novel. I certainly look forward to more from this new  author over the coming years.	2000-09-17

I have been a great admirer of Andrew Holleran for many years, and have  always enjoyed his stories he wrote for Christopher Street magazine.  Every  month I waited with anticipation for the next issue for his latest writing.   He always writes from the heart and these 16 stories prove it.  Andrew's  writing is so polished and easy to read, you feel you are listening to him  tell these stories in person.  Some of these stories are pleasant to read,  and others are very sad because they deal with loss(AIDS), loneliness,  getting older, and still having desires, especially to be young again, and  the yearning for youth.  <br />I found myself finishing one story and then  continuing right on into the next chapter without stopping, they are so  interesting.  Maybe its because these stories relate to my generation and  the times I lived through in the 70's and early 80's.  I feel this book  will interest anybody, there is so much beauty and history in his writing.   Andrew Holleran, I believe, has not been given enough recognition or credit  for his brilliant writing.  I truly enjoyed this book.	2000-08-09

He is a master at writing lines that are so rhythmatic and flowing.  These poems  deal with AIDS and also drug use.  They are not easy to read, and very sad  at times.  But they deal with problems and subjects most of us have had to  face in the last 20 years, whether we liked it or not.  There is true  feeling and honesty here.  I especially enjoyed \\"In the Time of Plague\\" and  \\"Memory Unsettled.\\"  <br />I recommend this book as part of your permanent  collection to be read again and again.

James Davidson, that handsome, brilliant young classical scholar from London has given us a small book (5 ½ in.by 7 ½, &amp; 151 Pages).  However, this book may be small in size and page number but is full of  great information.  It's part travelogue, classical history, mythology, and  personal essay about the island of Mykonos.  Mykonos is among the top 10  gay vacation spots today.  Davidson gives us his impressions and feelings,  as well as a wonderful history of this beautiful island.  <br />This is a  fascinating read, and now I know I definitely want to visit this Greek  island of Mykonos.  Reading Mr. Davidson's wonderful book made me feel as  if I actually had visited there already.  It's nice to know the history of  a place,  and this book gives you that, but you also get his feelings about  life there, too.   Make sure you read this one; highly recommended.	2000-07-26

David MacMillan has done it again by putting together 17 gay erotic stories about escorts or rent boys.  A fine collection from authors such as; Michael Cavanaugh, John Patrick, Chad Stevens and many more.  I  especially enjoyed \\"The Hired Hand\\" by John Patrick.  Its great that John  Patrick contributed to this collection, he has edited so many wonderful  erotic books of his own.  He really knows how to write erotic fantasy.  If  cover model \\"Tommy Cruise\\" isn't enough to get you to buy this book, then  buy it for the hot and sexy stories.  I really enjoyed this collection and  highly recommend it.	2000-07-26

Don Whitman was the genius behind the Western Photography Guild taking  male nude photography pictures in the outdoors from the late 40's to the early 60's.  This was considered \\"The Golden Age of Bodybuilding.\\"  These  are photos spanning this time period.  A great collection of nude and  non-nude photos of young men from the western states.  Don's organization  was based in Denver, Colorado.  These are photos of rugged men, and also  very handsome men.  There are also couples featured together in various  outdoor scenes.  I especially enjoyed the photos on Page 51 and 52.  There's a lost innocent in all these photos that you don't find today in  male nude photography.<br />David Chapman gives a great introduction and  history of Don Whitman and his life.  This is another great male nude  photography book helping to keep the history of that era of photography  alive today.  This would be a great addition to your collection.	2000-07-22

David Chapman has given us a great book of history showcasing early male bodybuilders, and nude male photography.  This is a book of 100 pages of fine, rare, and well printed pictures of the early physique stars, and  bodybuilders.  These photographs cover the period from 1870 to 1940 and are  accompanied with a well-written text by David Chapman.  There are many  photographs of the legendary \\"Eugene Sandow\\", \\"Tony Sansone\\" and many  unknown male nude physique stars of that period.   Many of the photos are  of unknown men who were photographed in the studio.  Of course, my favorite  photos are of Tony Sansone, who I idolized since I first seen his photos  many years ago when I was a young man.  <br />This book should definitely be  in your collection.  Another great book.  Let's hope he continues the  series.  Highly recommended!	2000-07-22

This is a disguised portrait of his friend Allan Bloom's (Ravelstein's) life, a University of Chicago professor who became an overnight success with the  publication of his book.   However, Bellow's remains mute on how he really  feels about gay people, etc.  We are only told that Ravelstein despised  \\"gay pride\\" and effeminate men.  <br />Bellow's certainly is a unique voice  and writes quite brilliantly about the human experience.  He does tend to  wander off in all directions at times, though.  This is an interesting and  very good book, and quite an outstanding work for an 84 year old author.   Therefore, I would recommend it because I enjoyed this otherwise fine  story.	2000-07-20

It's a wonderful and wickedly funny book.  David really knows how to write and is probably the funniest author around today.  The first part of the  book begins with his North Carolina childhood and the second half moves to  Paris.  What a wonderful collection of essays.  I especially enjoyed  \\"Today's Special\\" and \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster.\\"  But really all of the  essays are so funny, and true to life.  To be able to put these everyday  events into words that are simple yet so funny, is truly a gift.   <br />Believe it or not I haven't read his previous book \\"Naked\\", but now its  being pulled off my library shelf to be read immediately.   When you start  to read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" you will want to sit and read it right  through, forget about dinner and everything else.  This book deserves more  than 5 stars.  David, we await your next collection with eagerness.	2000-07-20

This is a breathtaking volume  of men from models and actors, to bodybuilders, dancers, and many others.   The photographs are superb, showing how they looked years ago and today.   It's not just all photos but also interesting essays broken down in  chapters spanning 10 year periods from the days of male nude repression to  today's general acceptance of male nudes.  <br />If you're a collector of fine  photography books, this is a must for your collection.

Sarah is a Lot-Lizard (a truck-stop whore).  All the whores at  this truck-stop are ruled by a pimp called Glad.  He's a decent guy and  treats his whore's well, looking out for their best interest.  Sarah's son,  an androgynous 12 year old boy who dresses as a girl, leaves his mother,  and the safety of her nest, to venture out on his own to become more famous  and well-known than his mother.  This is where Sarah's adventure really  begins.<br />  This story is way-out there somewhere!  I never read anything  like it.  It is a strange little story, easy to read in one sitting.  Its  funny at times, but sad, and deeply disturbing at other times.  I can  guarantee you, you won't want to put it down, because it is so interesting.   It's a great book from a clever writer, who will have to go a long way to  top this debut novel.  J.T. we're waiting!	2000-07-18

Mickey Skee has given us a collection of 14 erotic short stories here inspired by his real-life diary entries.  Beginning in 1988 and ending in 1998, this was his 10 year search for the \\"Big One\\", or the perfect penis.   These stories are pretty erotic but some are really hard to believe.  Take  for example, \\"The White Stuff:One Big Spurt for Mankind.\\"  This story was  told to him in confidence by \\"The Kid\\" after much cajoling about two  astronauts getting it on in outer space, and being recorded at the same  time for everyone on the ground to witness.  If this is a true story I want  to be an astronaut.  Who knew they were having so much fun in those space  capsules.  A little far-out. <br />All in all, Mickey has done an excellent  job in re-telling the erotic stories of his life.  The names and identities  of his famous and infamous sex partners have been changed, of course.  So  we are left with guessing, and being teased as usual, wondering whether all  these stories are true or untrue.  I would give it a rating as one of the  top 10 erotic books.  If you want a book to keep you up at night, this will  do it.	2000-07-17

And Edith Wharton is one of the best.<br />This story takes place in the cold, bleak winter farmlands of Massachusetts.  Ethan  Frome, a poor farmer, has a hard life tending to his land, trying to make a  meager living, and also taking care of his ungrateful, demanding, sickly  wife, Zeena.  When her cousin, Mattie, comes to help her, Ethan's life  changes completely.  He falls deeply in love with Mattie.  This being the  1800's, he must endure the stifling conventions of that era's society also.  There love for each other proves to be a fascinating story.<br />I loved  this book.  This is a story that will definitely take you away.  You'll  actually feel you are there.  Edith's detail description of the scenery  and landscape of that time are truly vivid.

Walter Copper has given us a gay book of witty verses, and also included some wonderful drawings of men in briefs, etc.  These are not drawings of real people but more like shadow  drawings, in the line of Keith Haring.  There are so many wonderful poetic  lines contained in these 79 pages.  You'll read it through in one setting.   The whole design of the book from the cover to the color pages is unique,  clever, and artistic.  The Astrological Heavenly Bodies section is great.   I loved the verse: \\"Zest for life, a relish for men, given the choice I'd  be Gay again.  <br />This book would make a great gift for all your gay or  straight (in the know) friends, that's for sure.

Walt, a gay man, runs a grocery store in Portland, where he has contact with poor Latino teenagers.  His relationship first with Johnny and then Raul, are on  the borderline of obsession, if not true obsession.  The whole book centers  around Walt trying to gain their love and having sexual relations with  these young men.  At times it's hard to take.  You hear yourself asking,  \\"doesn't he had any other interest in life\\" other than these boys.   <br />Although this is a taboo subject matter, Walt is a gifted writer who  speaks very honestly and from the heart.  It's a fascinating story of skid  row life in Portland, Oregon.  Its easy to get lost in these characters  lives.  You'll be anxious to read the book right through to the end.

These are very masculine men in their 20's.   Each month there is a large photo, a smaller photo, and a background shot  on the calendar of each model.  The lighting and background in any James  Loy photo is always perfectionism.  If your looking for full nudity, don't  look here, these men are in jeans, swimwear, etc, and they just bare there  upper bodies and torsos.  <br />A wonderful calendar to enjoy all year, and  save for your collection.	2000-06-21

Will abandons his Foreign Service post and returns to Paris to take up with an old lover named Pedro, who welcomes Will back after an absence of 7 years.  The two then become involved with a  diplomat's daughter, Jorie, who is mothering a Lebanese boy named Nico.   When Nico is snatched away by a French Nationalist gang, the suspense  begins.  Finding the missing little boy becomes the main thrust of this  story and from there on the story moves right along to its  conclusion.<br />The story is interesting enough and keeps you turning the  pages to the end, but I wish the relationship between Will and Pedro had  been developed more fully, and with more detail.  I would recommend this  book, because Gadol's writing is very smooth and the words just seem to  flow off the pages.  The ending was unexpected and a real surprise.  All in  all a good read.	2000-06-21

This is a soft-cover book, 9\\" by 10\\" covering about 50 of Roberto Gonzalez Fernandez's paintings of young men.  Some of them are nudes of guys alone or with other men.  The paintings cover a period from the late 70's thru  1987.  Roberto's art is very gay, but definitely not camp.  A lot of the  men are very attractive, and the images are homo-erotic but not  pornographic.  The detail, moody lighting, and coloring of these paintings  is beautiful.  The paintings are so detailed and realistic they seem like  photographs.  Roberto is a wonderful Spanish painter, that's for sure.<br />I  just wish there were more paintings to see.  A lot of the paintings have a  surrealistic quality.  He reminds me a lot of Salvadore Dali, but with more  emotion and eroticism.  Hopefully, more of his paintings will be published  in the near future.  This is a great artist to enjoy over and over, and is  highly recommended.	2000-06-21

That's how much I enjoyed Mr. Gunn's poems.<br />The book is divided into 3 sections of different subject matter.  I enjoyed the second section, \\"Gossip\\" the most.  There are a lot of poems about nights in bars, poems about bartenders, lovers, and other gay friends, and experiences.  The poem, \\"Letters from Manhattan\\" is an interesting poem about his friend and that friends sexual affairs with young men in outdoor settings in Manhattan.  In \\"American Boy\\" he talks about hating older men who bothered him when he was young, but now that his is old himself, he's attracted to younger men, and their love sustains him and gives him enlightenment in his old age. And then there are many other poems covering a wide range of subjects from King David to Jeffrey Dahmer.  <br />If you enjoy poetry that's intelligent, easy to read and understand, and full of gay experiences you can relate to, and other life experiences, you will truly enjoy this book.  Now that I am a fan of Thom Gunn, I can't wait to read his \\"Collected Poems\\" (1994) edition.  This book is highly recommended.  END	2000-06-13

How great it would be if all young gay men just coming out could have an older person, a Mentor, help guide them through life's trials and experiences.  It certainly would have helped me.  Jay Quinn's personal  narrative is such a honest, no holes-barred read, and so interesting.  It  must have been hard to put all this down for everyone to see.  Through all  his troubles with relationships, drugs, and depression, he manages to pull  through.  All with the help of his dedicated mentor, Joe Riddick.  <br />By  reading this book other gay men will relive their own similar experiences,  and know that they are not alone.  We are all here to experience what life  has to offer us, and it would be great if the different generations could  help guide each other.  We should all be \\"Mentors.\\"  I highly recommend  this book.	2000-05-27

Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia).  It focuses on his life after Arabia, but also tells about his troubled  childhood and his upbringing by a religiously fanatical,unforgiving mother.  She is the cause of much of Lawrence's later sexual frustrations and  inhibitions.  <br />He tries to live his life as an ordinary airman in the RAF  because he is tired of the legend that he has become.  This proves to be  very hard to do for no one can forget who he is. Lawrence's relationships  with Charlotte (a life-long friend) and Slaney, a bunkmate who he has a  love/hate relationship with, are probably the best written chapters in the  book. However, his fantasy love relationship with a young peasant man, is  of the greatest interest. He has several unacknowledged longings for other  men, but Dahoum proved to be the exception, and his life obsession.<br />This  is a book that surely I will read more than once.  A book to be enjoyed  over and over.  Steven's writing is superb and captivating.  An afterwood  is included which answers many questions.  I look forward to Steven's next  adventure.	2000-05-23

This is one of the most interesting collections of stories I have read about gay male life in a long time.  Most of these stories take place by the ocean in Provincetown and South Florida.  While the ending of the South  Florida gunmen's story is hard to believe, you'll die laughing when you  read, &quot;The Shih Master's Thermos&quot; with Christian and his antics.   Christian is a true Provincetown character.  There's even a story about  Marilyn Monroe &quot;The Last Performance&quot; which has a real twist to  it. Its hard to put this book down, so be prepared to want to force thru to  the end right away.  I can't wait for Mr. Rooney's next collection.	2000-05-12

Bel Ami's new collection of photos of Eastern European men is another in a series of his wonderful books, showcasing the most beautiful nude your men on this planet.  There are several new models as well as many of his most  famous ones here for a repeat performance.  The color, lighting and clarity  of these photos of his are breathtaking.  A truly creative photographer.  This is a must for anyone who is a collector of Bel Ami's fine photography  books.  Stunning!	2000-05-12

As in his previous 3 books, he poses his men in outdoor settings as well as indoors.  These are men who have beautiful bodies, out  of reach to most of us.  But Klaus also gets his point across in these  photos, that these are real men with feelings, jobs, relationships, and  problems like the rest of us.  Its wonderful that he lets us share in their  beauty when they are in such peak condition.  Another great book from  Klaus.	2000-05-12

These exquisite black &amp; white photos of male nudes he has taken over the past ten years, are so clear and lifelike.  They practically jump off the page.   Each model is photographed in a natural setting or by machinery.  Of  course, my favorites were of Steve Hammond on the inside covers, and Plate  #56. Even the book cover is a work of art.  Well done, and we thank you,  Dean Keefer, truly one of today's great photographers.	2000-05-08

The format for this book closely resembles that of an underwear catalog, in this case &quot;Rips&quot; underwear.  The book shows some extremely good-looking men in underwear, and without it, no frontal shots.  The  photography is well done, and some photos are very homoerotic.  We hope to  see more from this photographer.	2000-03-22

This Click Modeling Agency portfolio is unique in presenting their male and female models in a High School yearbook style.  Although there is no nudity, some models are presented in semi-undress, and the lighting and  color photography of Roger Moenks is truly wonderful.  A feast for the  eyes, and a unique book for your permanent library or for guests to enjoy  on your coffee table.  It was almost as good as &quot;Male Super- Models:  The Men of Boss Models&quot;, which was done a few years ago, but not  quite.	2000-03-13

The eighteen different essays from these highly qualified individuals gives the reader a  chance to sample many views about the joy of books.  I found John Bayley,  Laura L. Nagy's and Nina King's essays the most interesting.  What more  could you ask for? Nothing, so enjoy this collection!	1999-11-30

We know from the beginning Jean is the type of person who attracts danger, and when she meets Stephen Cain this becomes a fact.  I found little to like in either character, and couldn't understand why anyone such as Jean  would still want to be around Stephen after he slammed her hand in the car  door.  However, knowing her past of seeking dangerous situations, maybe it  gave her a thrill.<br />Yes, the story was suspenseful in the beginning but  seemed to end in a very boring, expected way.  If you like predictable  stories this one is for you.  There wasn't much guesswork here!	1999-11-30
