However, the crossiants were a disaster.  Too much flour to too little butter.  Much more success with Nick Malgieri's How to Bake recipe for crossiants, where the ratio of flour to butter makes more sense.  Brioche came out ok with this book.  It may be a classic, but that does not always mean success as newer books may provide better recipes from guru's such as Silverton, Levy and Malgieri.	2004-10-17

While Dobie's book is outdated with all the advances in watercolor pigments and newer more permanent lightfast color, Hill's book not only picks up with the use of newer pigments, but his suggestions are excellent.  This book is a wonderful addition to any library.  I kept it nearby as I do Dobie's book.  A must have book with excellent demonstrations and illustrations.  Also the artist's style and work is wonderful too.  A must have for anyone serious about watercolor, beginner or advanced.	2004-06-07

Like the other reviewer I found the secrets still secrets and not revealing enough information.  This publishers books seem to follow this pattern as with Alvaro Castagnet book Watercolor Painting with Passion (beautiful and inspiring illustrations by Castagnet but lacking decent text of the techniques and use of pigments used).<br />However, aside from the lacking technical information, Lynch's work is wonderful and inspiring.	2004-06-07

However, after borrowing the teacher's copy I began reading the text and found the information valuable and useful after trying  the suggested exercises.  Dobie's book along with Tom Hill's The Watercolorist's Complete Guide to Color combine as excellent references for learing to use color pigments and making colors &quot;sing&quot; instead of making mud.<br />I am giving Dobie's book 1 instead of 5 stars as it seriously needs updating considering some of the pigments Dobie uses are not lightfast and the inclusion of more modern pigments that replace these non-lightfast pigments would be useful all considering the book was first published in 1986, which is 18 years ago.  The lightfast references I am going by are Hilary Page and Michael Wilcox's books analyizing watercolor pigments.<br />Aside from Dobie's use of some outdated pigments (see handprint.com) the book is an excellent reference and her advice as to color mixing valuable.	2004-06-07

The few demonstrations, and I mean few, are limited and for the price I paid for the hardcover when this book came out not worth it.  There are better books out there on painting seascapes such as John Robinson's book.	2004-05-28

However, the passage of time and new titles such as An Encyclopedia of Cultivated Palms by Craft and Cultivated Palms of the World by Betrocks with updated information have made this title outdated as well as errors on some of the species and reclassifications.  For an update to reference seek the newer publications.  My copy sits on my shelf and hardly gets pulled as I prefer the newer publications on this topic.	2004-05-28

The authors went to a lot of trouble photographing the many species illustrated as well as the undertaking to provide information on each species but not perfect considering the magnitude of the task.  If you are a collector of palms or enjoy palm trees this book is a must in your library.  I use this volume as a reference regularly and could not imagine my library without it.

However, finding that palm horticulture varies widely between the species, I found this title a disappointment.  Some palms can't take iron for instance, but the authors neglect to give specific information on those species which would be helpful.  The same applies to those palms that need iron.  As a general guide, the book is ok, but if you really need to know how to care for your exotic and rare palms you may need advice from the local botanical garden or a nursery that specializes in growing palms to determine the nutritional requirements of a specific genus.	2004-05-28

Well true to those reviews this book is excellent and a must have.  In my opinion Mobbing is a companion to the Namie book and a must have for anyone in the workforce.  I could not put the book down once I opened the package and started reading.  This book really placed a name and identification as to what was happening to me in my work place.  Now I know what bullying and mobbing is all about and I also have the tools to fight back and keep my dignity.  The authors present their topic in a well thought out format and really speak to the reader.  The authors give examples but also point out and recognize that every situation is different and unique but note the underlying themes and patterns.  I can't say enough about this book as it is a must have for anyone either in the workforce or just entering.  Don't let mobbing and bullying ruin you and your career as anyone can learn the tools to identify such situations and protect their career.  I wish I had this book sooner but it is never too late to fight back and use the knowledge gained from this book.	2003-03-09
