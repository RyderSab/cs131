I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />Then again, afterwards you're left with a sort of empty feeling. Because where did those horrors Moore alludes to come from? And the answer is: from the beliefs that Moore espouses!<br /><br />Yes, ladies and gentlemen. In the scene where he broadcasts a message via a TV station, he plainly states that we are just animals, fresh off the tree. And this was the exact view that Hitler, for one, used to justify his campaign of killing the unwanted: the old, the infirm, the mentally ill, gays, Jews. As Bethell writes:<br /><br />\\"During the period of American neutrality in World War I, Kellogg was posted to the headquarters of the German general staff and was shocked to find German military leaders, sometimes with the Kaiser present, supporting the war with an \\"evolutionary rationale.\\" They did so with \\"a particularly crude form of natural selection, defined as inexorable, bloody battle. ...<br /><br />  \\"The creed of the Allmacht [\\"all might\\" or omnipotence] of a natural selection based on violent and competitive struggle is the gospel of the German intellectuals; all else is illusion and anathema.O This struggle not only must go on, for that is the natural law, but it should go on so that this natural law may work out in its cruel, inevitable way the salvation of the human species.O That human group which is in the most advanced evolutionary stage should win in the struggle for existence.<br /><br />\\"You like Darwin?\\" The German intellectuals were saying. \\"We'll give you Darwin.\\" (end quote)<br /><br />So Moore does not offer a solution but a deeper problem. But perhaps this was his intent? I don't know his beliefs.<br /><br />He portrays a cardinal or bishop or something as a pedophile, in one of many tired stereotypes; but it was Che Guevara, Mao, Stalin and friends, dire *enemies* of the church, who were responsible for butchering and torturing millions (well, Che didn't kill millions, just a few political enemies and gays, I guess. Another hero of the youth today!?). So there is a sort of blindness in his thinking that detracts from the book, makes you wonder about the seemingly clever bits of witty wisdom scattered throughout.<br /><br />But more troubling, his anti-hero butchers all manner of policemen, not sadistic thugs but poor sods just doing their job. But at least that's true to Darwinistic form. Maybe Moore is really trying to argue against Darwinistic amorality? You certainly feel for those poor working-class stiffs he kills off \\"for the greater good.\\"<br /><br />Again, his craftsmanship of the dialogue and frames are unquestioned. It's the lack of a coherent message that's the problem. The film ads say, \\"Governments should be afraid of their people.\\" All well and good, but what is he saying? That all citizens should have the right to bear arms? Or not? Perhaps just the supermen? He doesn't go far enough, is the problem; just far enough to give you a good sound bite.<br /><br />So - enjoy, but question. Even graphic novels should be taken skeptically, right?

No, the Bible is constantly telling us to look to heavenly rewards and a heavenly citizenship, not earthly. Work hard, make the most of your abilities, and in doing so glorify God, but set your sights higher than earthly ambition. When we depart this life, it's not what we gathered and collected that will be remembered by others, but what we gave, even if it's a widows's mite.<br /><br />All believers are called to be discerning; no preacher can be expected to be 100% right all the time.

For example, the idea that the plagues of Exodus were based on well-known, regular occurences such as the flooding of the Nile is absurd, demanding more belief in the stupidity of ancient man than is warranted. Similarly theories about the Exodus being a \\"compilation\\" of a couple of hundred slaves leaving Egypt over a number of years is so stupid as to beggar belief, if it were not advanced under the cover of academia. Long's \\"The Riddle of the Exodus\\" presents a better thesis.	2005-08-02

And there's too much \\"character development\\" which doesn't really add anything to the story except satisfy critics who moan about the lack of such things. But half the book is wasted on the relationship between Clevenger and his drug addict son, and should simply be skipped, especially since Clevenger is made to say things which alienate himself from Billy for dramatic effect.<br /><br />The cat and mouse thing played out in the NY Times looked interesting at first, but petered out. But oddly enough, in spite of the killer's religion, it does raise the question of whether a (somewhat) sane, intelligent person can become a serial killer, and the more astute will recognize that it's not the Christian we need to worry about but the atheist who has no moral moorings whatsoever except for what they choose.<br /><br />The dilemma is illustrated by the completely rational Darwinist (as much as is possible, that is) who kills to eliminate competing genes, and is not limited by society's laws. No satisfactory answer has yet been given to this problem. And it's not a fantasy - Darwinism was the \\"scientific\\" motivation behind the Nazi holocaust and the horrors of Communist rule, both of which dwarfed any atrocities committed by religious peoples.<br /><br />Also, serial killers like the Columbine killers who wore T-shirts touting survival of the fittest, and at least one famous killer who admitted Darwinism allowed him to jettison his morality.<br /><br />So, not a great book, but, in an unintended way, an important conversation piece.	2005-07-31

Scratch that.<br /><br />It is obvious that these people that like this book have closed minds and 1 sided opinions and views. ... hmmm, what about me? Why am I not reading this book? Am I close-minded myself? Note to self to meditate on this.<br /><br />\\"If you want to learn more about Islam, read the Quran to understad everything from the real source.\\" ... rats, that's not gonna work - that's what this whole book is about! Who wrote these talking points anyway?<br /><br />\\"If one wants to find out a religion, go to the source. Don't believe what others spoon feed you. If you have questions, read the koran, or ask an ismlamic scholar.\\" - no, he does that too, so that won't fly. He backs up every assertion he makes with quotes from the Quran and the hadith. Damn!<br /><br />And if islam is so horrible, why is it outgrowing christianity at a 10:1 ratio, even with all these evil books written bashing it? Answer me that question. Hah! ... no, wait, I can answer that myself. I was born into Islam, and I cannot leave it without fear of death or imprisonment. Also, when I talk to African-Americans, I've been advised not to tell them that Muhammad owned black slaves ...<br /><br />The world 'Islam' means peace, Allah calls people to peace. Quran summons people to peace and love and says if you kill one innocent person you will be considered to have murdered the entire humanity and if you help survive one person you will be considered to have helped the entire humanity. ... er, no, wait a minute. It doesn't mean peace, it means submission! The idiot who gave us these talking points should know that. Shouldn't he? And that other point is not from Islam, is it? What about those verses commanding us to kill infidels? I'm getting confused.<br /><br />ALL INTELLECTUAL PEOPLE OF THE WORLD, I REQUEST ONE THING FROM YOU: ... TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT SAYS BY LOOKING AT ITS SOURCE: THE HOLY QURAN. ... no, no, that won't work; that's what this book is doing!<br /><br />Please study the Quran with an open heart and then u will see how beautiful it really is like i do. See how the verses about peace and tolerance were later abrogated and replaced with verses about converting the world by force. See how wonderful - what am I saying???<br /><br />Spencer bends and distorts facts, perpetuates myths and defames characters in order to scare the public against a phenomenon that many are trying to learn about. For example, er ... um ... on page ... does anyone know of any such examples? A little help here.<br /><br />The writer utterly fails to mention positives in Quran for humanity and only points out the passages in Quran that may be perceived as negatives at this particular juncture of time. ... no, wait he does do that already. Curses!<br /><br />His lack of understanding or his intentional misinterpretation of verses and hadiths is clearly polemic and deceitful to the reader. For example, he misinterprets ... er ... I'm pretty sure there were some verse he misinterpreted. I'm very sure. And if I knew of any for a fact, I would surely list them here.<br /><br />Over the course of Muslim history, Islam has been known as a religion of tolerance. For example, Jews and Christians lived freely in Muslim Spain and in Palestine, as lower-class citizens. Well, not really even citizens, actually, and had to pay not to be harassed, but still ...<br /><br />Islam is the fastest growing faith in the World,specially in the West and more specially the US. I don't think that all those thousands who are embracing it every second couldNOT discover what the author claims he has found out. Unless (1) they are not allowed to question, which is mostly true; (2) they don't want to question, because it's dangerous to leave the faith; (3) they DO know, but are keeping quiet for obvious reasons; (4) they are being kept in the dark until the time is ripe. All of which I suppose could be true. But that's besides the point.<br /><br />I read the book, and a major problem that I saw is that Robert Spencer does not diffrentiate between what is going on in Muslim countries and what Islam teaches. He ... no, wait, he does do that.<br /><br />My advice is to read all the sides about Islam, and decide for yourself. No, wait, I mean - read books I approve of and don't mention stuff like Islam's conquest of Europe, Muhammad's approving assassination of his detractors, etc. That's too much information, which can be a bad thing. Very, very bad.<br /><br />The Islamic teachings are totally taken out of context, there was not one chapter where I could not smell his hatred and bias towards Islam/Muslims. Such people who are not honest and have lot of hatred in them should not be allowed to write.

Too much unnecesary writing, too many romantic interludes. I find I'm skipping about 60% of the pages. Also, the terse writing style is beginning to wear thin.<br /><br />The smarts and snappy dialogue are still there, with one exception - his pontificating on the Vietnam War. For some reason, rather than his normal informed and independent opinion, he simply regurgitates popular myths - the wrong war, the wrong time, etc. Hey, Reacher, tell that to the millions who were killed by the Communists when America pulled out. Funny, because in another book, he gets upset about people hunting *animals*. Other Hollywood facts he trots out: soldiers paying for souvenir ears and shrunken heads, and so on.<br /><br />There's an interesting parallel track where a smart woman tries to con her (and her husband's) way out of an awful situation. Then pages of kissy-talk between Reacher and a long-lost sweetheart. Overall, not the best Reacher novel.	2005-07-21

First was his smash hit, the Da Vinci Code - a stunning example of market savvy, and, it seemed, an inside joke on his target audience: a clever way of \\"outing\\" wannabe, theophobic intellectuals (and there was no shortage of these) who gullibly swallowed his claim of investigative accuracy, not knowing that Brown had fudged numerous details, much in the way (one supposes) detectives withold key evidence to filter out crank callers on their tip lines. The spectacle of critics hailing his \\"impeccable research\\" must have given him many a chortle.<br /><br />But this book reveals the author's owned skewed reality, infused with what seems to be a frothing, partisan hatred that has blinded him from a key issue of the book. His venomous bent has resulted in one of the most ham-fisted portrayals I've ever seen: One of the key villains is a gay-hating, misogynous, adulterous, child-sacrificing ... Republican. Yes, once you've grasped the impossibility and utter ridiculousness of this one-dimensional character, everything else in the book takes on a cartoonish quality. Likewise the unquestioning special ops team which murders civilians willy-nilly. Of course, one must keep in mind the gullibility of his intended audience.<br /><br />Which is a shame, because in his naivete, Brown seems to have an ability to grasp some good technical detail, affording us some scientific detective work. Strangely, though, most of it is done by his female protagonist, who is singularly unqualified, but puts the true scientists to shame. Perhaps Brown's commentary on the state of the scientific enterprise. At the same time, he gives her the lamest, most puerile dialogue I've seen in a while. Brown just can't pull off smart, snappy, human banter. It's not all bad, but she just seems to be fed the worst of it.<br /><br />There is some interesting plotting, but halfway through the book you just want it to end, even the action and the Delta teams grisly comeuppance, which is all foreordained. The evil Republican continues to lie and generally disgust us throughout, while the Democratic president is the model of goodness and innocence. It's sad that Brown just couldn't resist this tirade of wish-fulfillment. Be assured, though, that this bad man gets his just desserts, o yes.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, Brown is able to grasp specific areas of scientific knowledge, but seems unable to grasp the implications. One of the biggest holes has to do with the idea of panspermia, or the seeding of life on earth from space. He portrays this as the end-all of the question of life's origins, seeing as how conditions on earth could not have reasonably given rise to life spontaneously. But his scientists neglect to wonder how life arose elsewhere in the first place; it's just a non-issue for them. Apparently \\"from a rock in space\\" is good enough for his audience. However, if his success in \\"Code\\" was any indication of how much he has to worry about the possibility of critical thinking and fact-checking from his readers, this will indeed be a non-issue.<br /><br />Some of his descriptions of weapons and technology are interesting. Are they factual, as he claims? Who cares. I give him two stars for trying to write what could have been a thoughtful book, and only two stars for his partisan ranting.ppance, which is all foreordained.

There is some plot and action thrown in almost as a shell to make it a novel, but the value of the book is in the scientific references and in seeing both sides of the arguments. Crichton correctly takes the skeptical side in this argument, skewering the hypocrisy and gullibility of the celebrities who endorse the cause in their global-warming private jets, the laziness and stupidity of the media who parrot the dire warnings, the scumminess of the United Nations in altering their CPPI report conclusions, and the average person who believes in global warming but doesn't know why (or why they shouldn't).<br /><br />The argument is compelling and timely. For that I give it four stars. Now if only Crichton would turn his skeptical spotlight on HIV-AIDS (popular-level intro to the possible scientific problems at AliveAndWell org) and Darwinism (see ARN), his missions to debunk popular myths will be complete.	2004-12-13

On the one hand, women will benefit greatly from this new version. On the other hand, the author has not been completely honest about what he has done here. So it is a &quot;mixed bag.&quot;<br />But it's a good strategy because sites like answering-islam.org use the more accurate translations in their questioning of the faith, and has caused a lot of doubts within the community. This version will give us a good way to move away from that problem. Some say it's almost like admitting that the Prophet and his earliest followers were wrong about what they thought the Quran said, about killing infidels and troublemakers, but most Americans are not knowledgeable about this anyway.<br />I give it only 3 stars because Ali has done a foolish thing by including the Arabic text, which contradicts his translation in some places, and also shows some grammatical errors in the original.	2004-07-02

Useful for a quick introduction to various topics, but the author obviously has a bone to pick with theism. Whereas most surveys begin with theories of knowledge or truth, Warburton starts with the topic of God - and presents a hopelessly biased, poorly-informed argument against God's existence. This is inexcusable, considering the wealth of debate freely available today on this topic. Can he really never have heard of William Lane Craig, J.P. Moreland, etc.? This shortcoming taints the rest of the book, but has the advantage of making you question his every assertion and argument, thus sharpening your thinking.<br />But another annoyance - Hume gets a free pass! Hume is the last word on skepticism. Hume is unquestioned. Every other view is critiqued except Hume's. It's nauseating. Is this the state of academia today?	2004-04-04

If you feed a camel 100 tons of water, he will kick you, but if you give him a small cup of water at a time he will befriend you.

Ali fails to take this opportunity to address the well-known problems such as the grammatical and historical errors, and instead adds words throughout the text to make it more palatable to Western readers, in many places changing the meaning completely. In fact this distortion of the text should be considered blasphemy, if not for the fact that some adherents consider deception to be an acceptable means of advancing the cause.<br />The fact that all reviews for this item seem to have been quietly removed perhaps speaks volumes about the plain meaning of its unadorned teachings, discomfort with what Ali has done, or the power of its adherents to silence doubts.	2003-12-02

After  describing the appalling butchery of  POWs and  other horrors practiced by the Japanese, and  the outrage such savagery provoked here in the  US, he describes some take-no-prisoners  incidents perpetrated by the US, and wags his  finger: &quot;When U.S. prisoners were killed, it  was 'murder ...' But when Americans murdered  Others, 'they had it coming to them.'&quot; Er ...  excuse me, Bozo, but didn't you read what you  just wrote?<br />To wit, the behavior of the Japanese. Did it  not occur to the author that their rejection of  the Geneva Convention, brutal treatment (rape,  murder and torture) of civilians, and other  scummy actions, such as this:<br />&quot;The wounded wait until [US] men come up to  examine them ... and blow themselves and the  other fellow to pieces with a hand grenade&quot; (p.  143)<br />could somehow lead American soldiers to regard  their enemies as subhuman monsters? I dunno, I  think it's possible. Sure, they look different  ... but they also behave different, and that's  the key.<br />How about slicing open living POWs and removing  their lungs or stomachs, without anesthesia?  Poking around in their brains with a knife and  twisting to see what body parts jerk?<br />When an enemy not only murders your POWs as a  matter of policy and in explicit disregard of  the rules of war, but has demonstrated that  they will not surrender, will blow you to bits  if you show compassion or try to help them, and  have no regard whatsoever for any human life,  not even civilians (not even their own), what  do they expect? What does the author expect?  Yet he constantly attempts to suggest that  either side was just as bad.<br />Elsewhere he reports that the Japanese  justifiably regarded the American firebombers  as devils. Yes, the napalming of Tokyo was  horrible, but what did they expect after their  sons' killing sprees - hacking hundreds of  thousands of non-Japanese (Chinese, for  example) to pieces, raping and killing and  sometimes eating daughters of civilians,  forcing children to become &quot;comfort women&quot;, the  dishonorable attack on Pearl Harbor, practicing  bayoneting on live prisoners, spraying typhoid,  etc. etc.? Does the glee American soldiers and  the American public felt over killing such a  subhuman enemy - proven so by their actions -  become more understandable? Do the complaints  of firebombing Japanese civilians seem to  recede into the distance of their hypocrisy?<br />The crucial difference is that these most of  the Japanese atrocities were a matter of  official policy or direct orders, as opposed to  the visceral hatred engendered in individual  American soldiers by witnessing the inhumanity  of the Japanese military.<br />It is well written, though, and you do get a  sense of the heroism of the American military,  warts and all - and the author does try to show  us as many warts as he can. He is also candid  about the horrors perpetrated by the Japanese,  not only upon Others, but upon themselves. The  analysis of how the Japanese got locked into a  couple of different mindsets and how that led  to their defeat is also interesting. And we  learn a little more about the amazing heroism  of pilots like George Bush Sr. When I was less  informed (still naively reading TIME, Newsweek, and the  Washington Post for &quot;news&quot; ... thank God I happened upon the Media Research Center), I chuckled  with Oliphant's baseless ridiculing of Bush's  war record. After reading this book, I cannot  help but cheer him as a true hero.<br />I would like to have given this book four stars  or more but due to the above, which may further  encourage Japan's whitewashing of their brutal  history. (I don't have to worry about America's  history being whitewashed; too much white guilt  and self-loathing around here for that.) It is  definitely worth a read, in spite of the  author's attempts to be sensitive. Fortunately,  these are infrequent. Yes, neither side is  guiltless ... but neither do both sides bear  equal guilt, by any means. The Japanese are so  ashamed of their history that they have to  rewrite it; they understand this. And,  strangely, so does the author, quoting Paul  Fussell after reminding us that more people  were killed with samurai swords than atomic  bombs:<br />&quot;The degree to which Americans register shock  and extraordinary shame about the Hiroshima  bomb correlates closely with lack of  information about the Pacific war.&quot;), I chuckled  with Oliphant's baseless ridiculing of Bush's  war record.

Due to the obtuseness of the left, many secrets valuable to our national security were ferried to the Soviets.<br /><br />On the way the author roundly skewers the ideological blindness of the media, such as the NYT. Ted Koppel is shown simpering with a Soviet spy who fled to the USSR and afterward helped develop weapons used against our troops in Vietnam, emerging from the interview as clueless as before. The bias and resulting distortion in the media is again showcased.<br /><br />This book is especially an important antidote to the skewed images your kids will receive from the media and even their schooling. The truth is more shocking than you could have imagined. What is even more shocking is the refusal of the left to acknowledge the evidence to this day (\\"suspected spy\\", \\"might have been a spy\\", \\"believed by the vast right-wing conspiracy to be a spy\\", etc.).<br /><br />Update: I was \\"re-reading\\" this book on audio and was stunned by how badly Democrats have been wrong on so many matters of import. Most disturbing was how, according to Coulter, they practically gave up China and Vietnam to the horrors of Communism, believing it to be a largely benign \\"agrarian reform\\" effort, or of how Democratic Presidents and the media elite haw-hawed the Communist threat, placing Soviet spies in key government positions. The magnitude of their failure to see the world as it really is can only speak to a level of delusion that is indeed dangerous to freedom.<br /><br />Now, of course, the claims Coulter makes are so stunning that I went to spinsanity (as one reviewer recommended) to see what they had to say about her facts. Sure enough, they pointed out a dozen or so factual errors. But upon further reading, I found that many of the \\"errors\\" had to do with spinsanity's inability to grasp Coulter's ironic humor (calling liberals \\"traitors\\" because their actions are indistinguishable from those of actual traitors - not that hard a point to grasp, is it?), and the others were points so trivial that I was quite disappointed. (The harping about the NYT's quoting a Reagan administration official not actually qualifying as the NYT's *reminding* its readers that Reagan was \\"a cowboy\\" was particularly lame. Regardless of the source, that's exactly what the NYT was doing.) I was hoping to find rebuttals of her reversed portrayal of McCarthy and his enemies, but so far they are nowhere to be found, at least in what seems to be one of her most vociferous critics at spinsanity. The liberals' gay-baiting, fascist tactics, and other reprehensible and infantile behavior regarding McCarthy, and the subsequent myth, as described in this book, should be an eye-opener to any honest reader.

PLease.<br />It starts off interesting, but wears off quickly. Mostly parrotting of liberal views of biblical archeology, with some dialogue between the author and various experts, mostly to show the author's &quot;intellectual sparring&quot; and new &quot;insights&quot;. Liberal scholarship, by the way, is most notable for denying pretty much anything described in the Bible, such as positing that the Exodus is a warped version of a couple of hundered slaves leaving Egypt over many years - a theory so idiotic, so denigrating of the intelligence of ancient peoples that it reveals more about the desperate longings of some archeologists for an alternate reality where the Bible has not been repeatedly verified by their own science. And see &quot;Riddle of the Exodus&quot; for an interesting new theory.<br />Interviews invariably terminate on this note: we can't believe the Bible as an historical document, but we can believe its message (???) by faith - OK if you're content to base your life on what you believe to be a work of fiction, I suppose, but not the most intellectually satisfying tack. Have they never read &quot;Biblical Archeology Review&quot;?

Unless there is some serious mistranslation going on, the parallels are eerie and unmistakable. &quot;The King is carried off by poor men ... the river is blood ...&quot; (or something quite like it) and so on.

A chilling, non-sensationalistic look at the &quot;sloppiness&quot; and general lack of integrity of members of the scientific establishment who, in their devotion to defending the current models of human origins, reject or ignore unwelcome data - much of it seemingly impeccably researched - that would throw much of their field into (even more) utter confusion.<br />It is hilarious and tragic to see this book being ridiculed by &quot;reviewers&quot; who have obviously never read it, but another symptom of the close-mindedness of the keepers of evolutionist dogma, as lamented by Richard Milton (&quot;Shattering the Myths of Darwinism&quot;). Now that their religion has been debunked by Behe's &quot;Darwin's Black Box,&quot; it remains to be seen their level of true scientific curiosity as regards Cremo &amp; Thompson's findings.<br />There are the howls about Cremo's religion. Do they reject Newtonian physics because of Newton's creationist beliefs? Do they likewise pooh-pooh the contributions of Lister, Pasteur, Boyle, Maxwell, Peirce? Cremo admits his beliefs up front, and never do they impinge on his detailed, sober analyses in this book. They would do better to reject Darwinism (&quot;[T]he literalists are absolutely right. Evolution is a religion&quot; - M. Ruse, atheist), a religion whose adherents see fit to fit false feet to fossils (&quot;Lucy&quot; was modeled with human feet and hands for public consumption although she was known to have had apelike ones).<br />Any objective reading will show that Cremo is ironically more scientific than his detractors, and has a thorough grasp of the subject matter.<br />The sheer volume and detailed discussion of &quot;anomalous&quot; data compiled in this book is staggering: traces of the hand of man (tools, etc.) found in strata millions of years before his supposed appearance on the evolutionary scene; off-the-cuff dismissals of such evidence by influential scientists for sometimes contradictory reasons (and sometimes almost none at all!); the findings of distinguished, top-notch scientists ridiculed and being branded as heresy for going against the prevailing dogma.<br />It is instructive that most scientists today are totally unaware of the controversial evidence presented here, even in their fields of specialty. If we are able to do as the authors ask and evaluate the evidence as it stands without prejudice against their (eastern) religious beliefs, we might well find that the underpinnings for their belief in the great antiquity of the human race is at least as solid as that of the ruling paradigm - and probably even more so. Even if we do not agree with their conclusions (I don't), an open-minded inquiry into these findings will certainly show current theories to be, at best, seriously negligent in blissful ignorance - Mr. Magoo in a lab coat - or, at worst, anti-science.<br />Remember, Piltdown was &quot;scientifically&quot; worshipped as our ancestor for near 40 years. Whereas science may be self-correcting, evolutionists are obviously somewhat deficient in this regard.led in this book is staggering: traces of the hand of man (tools, etc.) found in strata millions of years before his supposed appearance on the evolutionary scene; off-the-cuff dismissals of such evidence by influential scientists for sometimes contradictory reasons (and sometimes almost none at all!); the findings of distinguished, top-notch scientists ridiculed and being branded as heresy for going against the prevailing dogma.<br />It is instructive that most scientists today are totally unaware of the controversial evidence presented here, even in their fields of specialty.

Books	5	83	141	N	Y	Some Icons Are Too Precious to be Discarded	And we wonder why we rank so low in science and math. Perhaps this mantra will demonstrate the problem:<br />\\"The author offers no valid theory in place of the theory of evolution, so what is the point of this book? He pointed out some very interesting flaws in the explanations of evolution, but he does not offer alternative scientific explanations for the observations.\\"<br />Unfortunately this is representative of the quality of reasoning employed in negative \\"reviews\\" of this book. Elsewhere you will find: misrepresentations of creationist claims; misrepresentations of Wells' arguments (\\"it's a religious book\\"); etc. Are these the kinds of \\"free thinking\\" we want to emulate? That because an alternative is not presented, thus we can ignore the fatal flaws in the current theory?<br />These are the people who would logically have to proclaim quantum theory a hoax, because the current state of the theory is unintelligible to them, thus not providing \\"an alternative to classical physics\\". But science will prevail over emotional needs to support theories which bolster cherished materialistic beliefs.<br />\\"Although Haeckel's exaggerations are certainly disturbing, there is still very substantial similarity between the vast majority of vertebrate embryos, even without the exaggeration.\\" Where does this reviewer get his embryos? The utter dissimilarity is not a creationist fiction; it was exposed in Science and New Scientist ...Is every scientific discovery that debunks Darwinism a creationist conspiracy?<br />Elsewhere: \\"Creationists do not any longer completely knock evolution. They can't as too much has been proven.\\" Has this reviewer read any creationist literature in the past decade? More probably, he confuses acceptance of microevolution (small mutations which never produce new species) with macroevolution, which has never been observed. But this kind of confusion is common (and indeed necessary) with evolutionists.<br />Wells shows that the stock arguments used to give students the impression that \\"too much has been proven\\" are in fact not only demonstrably false, but more disturbingly, they have been known to be false all the while they were trotted out as \\"proof.\\" Is this the kind of scientific dishonesty we should be trusting as the authority on origins?<br />Perhaps a measure of skepticism is in order for these self-proclaimed \\"free thinkers.\\" Will no amount of scientific revelation be enough to plant that seed of doubt in their loyal, believing minds?<br />Why are they so terrified of finding out that evolutionism may be wrong?

Many passages which have been abhorrent to Westerners have been creatively rewritten - thus Yusuf Ali is not strictly speaking a translator, but a reinventor. This may make for a kinder, gentler faith for Westernized believers, but raises the question: Is Ali saying that before the mid 1950's, the translation was wrong for 1,400 years? Were Muslims of old simply terribly mistaken? Ali seems to be saying most traditional interpretations have been wrong. And even with his efforts, we are left with fatalism, a God who is distant, the source of all good and even evil, and who will one day decide each person's eternal destiny, not based on their sincerity or good works, but on His own decision.    Some of Ali's changes are questionable, especially those dealing with spousal discipline. For Sura 4:34, \\"admonish them and forsake them in beds apart, and beat them,\\" Ali adds the word \\"lightly\\", which is not in the Arabic, nor is it inherent in the meaning of the Arabic word \\"idreb\\", which is used seven other times to mean physical striking. How do we know this is the correct sense? The reason behind this revelation was given in Razi's commentary, \\"At-Tafsir al-Kabir,\\" on 4:34:    \\"A woman complained to Muhammad that her husband slapped her on the face, (which was still marked by the slap). At first the prophet said to her: \\"Get even with him\\", but then added: \\"Wait until I think about it\\". Later on, Allah revealed 4:34 to Muhammad, after which the prophet said: \\"We wanted one thing but Allah wanted another, and what Allah wanted is best.\\"    It is not hard to see why there is some confusion as to what is meant. On the one hand, Muhammad was going to tell her to get even, as it was a slap hard enough to leave a mark. On the other hand, the revelation from Allah condones the slap. But to addto the confusion, shortly before his death, Muhammad said to \\"beat them, but not with severity\\". Does this mean a slap is \\"not severe\\" and is allowed?    This brings to mind the so-called \\"Satanic Verses\\" (53:19-23) where Muhammad was tricked into speaking \\"revelation\\" from Satan (which Ali completely fails to address, and which Islamic sources call The Story of the Cranes and accepted as authentic by the earliest Islamic scholars: Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Sa'd. Al-Tabari and Ibn Taymiyyah). Was the first revelation saying hard slapping was all right, then a later revelation saying it's not?    Ali also glosses over the many grammatical errors in the original Arabic, which is a disappointment. For example, 5:69 vs. 2:62, 22:17 (Saabi'uuna declined incorrectly); 20:63 (haazaani should be haazayn); 2:1777 (five errors), etc.	2002-03-06

But the difficulties will not go away and a book which was envisioned as a pop science piece should have addressed them, even if inadequately.<br />There is no reply to Behe's challenge of providing evolutionary explanations on the level of molecular detail, which is now the only level which matters. Even a parade of transitional fossils would not address this problem, which is perhaps the crux of the argument. The evolutionary scenarios remain hopelessly superficial and vague - perhaps reflecting their target audience.<br />In a way, the title is right. For forty years, the idea of evolution triumphed over science, until Piltdown Man was exposed as a fraud. Evolution triumphs, but only in the same way that Scientology still triumphs in the minds of its many adherents. Evolution also wins through frantic publishing and publicity instead of debate.<br />Unfortunately, it is at the cost of progress and science itself. A little more scientific integrity and willingness to explore the scientific problems, such as how evolution apparently also triumphs over physics and probability, and can generate mind-bogglingly complex systems of cascading molecular interactions, would have been welcome, especially the seeming impossibility of abiogenesis, the obstacles of which are both enormous and well known in origins research.ding molecular interactions, would have been welcome, especially the seeming impossibility of abiogenesis, the obstacles of which are both enormous and well known in origins research.	2002-01-31

During the early days of the Committee, Kurtz and several others were engaged in a scientific study of astrology.10 Dennis Rawlins, an astronomer and member of the Executive Council of CSICOP, conducted the detailed calculations and data analysis for the project. He began noticing severe problems: The results were supporting the case for an astrological influence of Mars on sports ability, much to the consternation of the investigators. Rawlins tried to bring this to the attention of other Committee members. This lead to a bitter dispute, with Rawlins charging that serious mistakes had been made and that Kurtz had undertaken a Watergate-style cover-up. Rawlins (1981) was forced out of CSICOP, and he published an expose in Fate. There was no real answer to the charge of a cover-up, and much was published about it in Zetetic Scholar. The upshot was that several of the more moderate people resigned from the Committee. Rawlins's article appeared in the October 1981 issue of Fate, and that same month CSICOP instituted a policy of not conducting research itself (\\"Policy on Sponsoring,\\" 1982).<br />  After the moderate members left, little dissent or criticism of the Committee has been seen in the pages of SI.

Chief among them is the myth that thousands of scientific papers actually address Behe's challenge.<br />At the ARN website, however, Behe shreds these initially impressive but shoddily-compiled claims:<br />&quot;The assertion here that very many papers have been published clashes with statements of the reviews I quoted earlier which say, for example, that &quot;The problems have indeed been sorely neglected.&quot; (Cavalier-Smith 1997) Would reviewers such as Jerry Coyne and Tom Cavalier-Smith--both antagonistic to my proposal of intelligent design--be unaware of the &quot;hundreds, possibly thousands, of scientific papers that deal with this very subject&quot;? Both claims--that the problems have been neglected and that the problems are being actively investigated--cannot be correct. Either one set of reviewers is wrong, or there is some confusion about which publications to count. Which is it?<br />&quot;In the context of my book it is easy to realize that I meant there has been little work on the details of the evolution of irreducibly complex biochemical systems by Darwinian means. I had clearly noted that of course a large amount of work in many books and journals was done under the general topic of &quot;molecular evolution,&quot; but that, overwhelmingly, it was either limited to comparing sequences (which, again, does not concern the mechanism of evolution) or did not propose sufficiently detailed routes to justify a Darwinian conclusion. Yet the Catalano site lists virtually any work on evolution, whether it pertains to irreducible complexity or not. For example it lists semi-popular books such as Patterns in Evolution: The New Molecular View by Roger Lewin, and general textbooks on molecular evolution such as Molecular Evolution by Wen-Hsiung Li.<br />&quot;Such books simply don't address the problems I raise. ... [Li's book] does not include how specific, irreducibly-complex biochemical systems were built. The text contains chapters on the molecular clock, molecular phylogenetics, and other topics which essentially are studies in comparing gene sequences. As I explained in Darwin's Black Box, comparing sequences is interesting but cannot explain how molecular machines arose. Li's book also contains chapters on the mechanisms (such as gene duplication, domain shuffling, and concerted evolution of multigene families) that are thought to be involved in evolution at the molecular level. Again, however, no specific system is justified in Darwinian terms.<br />&quot;... Li himself has not done work on understanding how the obstacles to the evolution of the clotting cascade may have been circumvented. Since those investigators who do work in that area have not yet published a detailed Darwinian pathway in the primary literature (1), we can conclude that the answer will not be found in a more general text. We can further assume that the processes that text describes (gene duplication, etc.), although very significant, are not by themselves sufficient to understand how clotting, or by extension any complex biochemical system, may have arisen by Darwinian means.<br />&quot;Catalano's site lists other books that I specifically discussed in Darwin's Black Box, where I noted that, while they present mathematical models or brief general descriptions, they do not present detailed biochemical studies of specific irreducibly complex systems. (Gillespie 1991; Selander et al. 1991) There is no explanation on Catalano's web site of why he thinks they address the questions I raised.<br />&quot;... In Finding Darwin's God (Miller 1999) Kenneth Miller is also anxious to show my claims about the literature are not true (or at least are not true now, since the handful of papers he cites in his section &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; were published after my book appeared). Yet none of the papershe cites deals with irreducibly complex systems. ...&quot;<br />Seems like it's time for fundamentalist Darwinists to be a little more skeptical, a little more open-minded - and a little more rational. Behe's book gently nudges them back towards empirical science, rather than evolutionism, which one frustrated evolutionist finally proclaimed &quot;a fairy-tale for grown-ups.&quot;pers he cites deals with irreducibly complex systems. ...&quot;<br />Seems like it's time for fundamentalist Darwinists to be a little more skeptical, a little more open-minded - and a little more rational.

From Tektonics:<br />\\"[m]any of the claims made about parallels between Jesus and pagan figures are only justified by reference to books that are nearly a hundred years out of date and, as J. P. Holding has demonstrated, modern Mithras studies have moved on a good deal. In the few cases where I could check their sources something rather surprising came up. Freke and Gandy are so selective and vague with their references that I could find a statement that totally contradicts their central thesis on the very page that they pointed to.<br />\\"A couple of examples will surface to show we are not dealing with a pair of objective scholars but people who are willing to pull the wool over the eyes of their readers. They refer many times to The Mysteries of Mithra by Francis Cumont and published in 1903. Yet we find that in his comparison of Mithraism and Christianity, Cumont (certainly no friend of Christianity himself) specifically states that unlike Mithras, Jesus was a real person.<br />\\"When dealing with ancient sources they are even more blatant. On the basis of some third century pictures of crucifixions, the authors claim Bacchuus was crucified and Christians copied the idea. This is their piece de resistance and they even put one of the pictures on the cover of their book. But suppose there existed an earlier source who stated categorically that no pagan godman was crucified. That would destroy their case and reading the Jesus Mysteries you would assume that neither Freke or Gandy knew of such a source even if it existed. You would be wrong.<br />\\"They quote from Justin Martyr many times about his concerns that pagans and Christians had some similar rituals (they did and modern scholarship is totally unsurprised by this). He is a second century writer who therefore predates all the pictures of pagan godmen being crucified and he writes:<br />\\"But in no instance, not even in any of those called sons of Jupiter, did they imitate the being crucified; for it was not understood by them, all the things said of it having been put symbolically.\\" Justin Martyr 's First Apology LX.<br />\\"No honest scholar would simply fail to quote this vitally important contradiction to their thesis.

But they were right.<br />Unfortunately, it's not one of those no-nonsense Biblical angels. She writes like one of those daffy, dewey-eyed, diapered, dinky-winged ones instead. Let me clarify.<br />The science described in this book is interesting. This is where the author is at her best. However, she wanted to seem like a deep thinker, too, and that's where she founders into New-Age-like poofiness, seasoned with ecological alarmism. But you want specifics.<br />\\"... [l]ife has learned to fly, circumnavigate the globe, live in the depths of the ocean ... lasso the sun's energy ... in short ... everything we want to do, without guzzling fossil fuel, polluting the planet, or mortgaging their future.\\"<br />Sorry, sis, nature doesn't move hundreds of 120-lb passengers at a time along with their luggage, or make trips to the moon, or produce supercomputers. Our sights, for better or worse, are higher, and so are our needs.<br />\\"Virtually all native cultures that have survived without fouling their nests have acknowledged that nature knows best, and have had the humility to ask the bears and wolves and ravens and redwoods for guidance. They can only wonder why we don't do the same.\\"<br />Perhaps she hasn't heard how native Americans would decimate thousands of buffalo at a time, or burn trees for after-dinner entertainment, or basically slash-and-burn their way through nature. Nature knows best? How silly can you get? Does that include the violent killing of prey, volcanoes, tidal waves, disease? And why should Nature \\"know\\" anything?<br />\\"We humans regard limits as a universal dare ... other Earthlings take their limits more seriously, knowing they must function within a tight range of life-friendly temperatures, harvest within the carrying capacity of the land, and maintain an energy balance that cannot be borrowed against.\\" More idiocy. Other organisms know nothing of the sort. They merely function as programmed, reacting to situations by instinct, blissfully ignorant of all these issues. Unless she's talking about Disneyworld, which seems to be where her mind is when not describing biological marvels.<br />\\"Who's to say we won't simply steal nature's thunder and use it in the ongoing campaign against life? ... This is not an idle worry. The last really famous biomimetic invention was the airplane ... by 1914, we were dropping bombs from the sky.\\" The silliness goes on and on, believe me. Doesn't she understand that anything can be used as a weapon? Are we to stop making chairs and tables? Even then, nature-made rocks are handy.<br />She quotes an organic farmer: \\"The native peoples ... worshipped the Earth; they were educated by it. They didn't require schools and churches - their whole world was one.\\" Well, maybe that's why they regularly slaughtered and mutilated one another, missy. Did she get all her history from \\"Dances with Wolves?\\"<br />She throws in some latin here and there to reinforce her intellectual image, but it just seems pretentious.<br />The rest of the book is interesting but somehow spoiled by her nauseating pretensions to philosophizing. Unfortunately she starts out with a rather boring (to me) topic - biomimicry in farming. But it gets better - she goes on to harnessing solar power, making wondrous materials, and so on. She does this quite well, and it's too bad she didn't stick to this.<br />Also, unfortunately, she has been caught up in the assumption that nature is in a state that is \\"just right\\" - related to the \\"nature knows best\\" myth - that is the most puzzling belief of environmental alarmists. Why should it be? Supposedly nature is continually evolving - species here today, if unfit, should simply be gone tomorrow, nary a second thought. But she doesn't grasp this, although she says at the beginning, \\"failures are fossils.\\"<br />If you can stomach this kind of naive psychobabble, you'll marvel at the ingenuity and complexity ofnature ... in this way, this book is a good companion to \\"Darwin's Black Box.\\"nature ... in this way, this book is a good companion to \\"Darwin's Black Box.\\"	2001-12-21

A highly educated man tries to, in effect, stop time for the Kikuyu tribe, on their own planetoid, where he can isolate them from the outside world (so-called &quot;western&quot; influences) and propagate their ancient customs.<br />This is a remarkable book, written with so much wisdom and insight. The dialogue and prose is sharp and controlled. Resnick presents both sides of the arguments with such clarity and humanity, it's sometimes heartbreaking. Koriba's well-intentioned but ultimately misguided crusade against change is challenged again and again, not necessarily by the &quot;outside&quot;, but by the &quot;inside&quot; - the minds and hearts of his villagers. It's fascinating to see how he resolves these challenges to his authority and his hopes for the Kikuyu ... and sometimes downright scary.<br />The book also shows us the erroneous assumption of multiculturalism - that everything in every culture is worth saving and perpetuating. The modern myths of the Kikuyu - and indeed of many peoples on this planet - that &quot;the West&quot; is to blame for their condition and/or corruption (and everything &quot;Western&quot; should therefore be anathema) is not spared.  It's tempting to carry on here about the general public's overwhelming ignorance of Africa's booming slave trade, because it's all in the same vein.<br />The stories show that for all our differences in time and space, people are the same everywhere - and that is the &quot;problem&quot; that cannot be controlled by isolation.<br />The reality is that every culture is always changing. The Kikuyu ways Koriba is trying to preserve are only a snapshot of a tribe that is both naturally degenerating (see &quot;Eternity in Their Hearts&quot;, by Don Richardson) and gravitating towards &quot;Western&quot; ways - which, by the way, were largely exported from the Mediterranean, that is, from Israel! (See &quot;How the Irish Saved Civilization&quot;, &quot;The Gifts of the Jews&quot;, &quot;Desire of the Everlasting Hills&quot; by Thomas Cahill.) No culture is meant to live in statis, nor can it be done. Peoples and people are meant to grow, to mature. Multiculturalism can serve us by preserving, recording, or interpreting that which is worth saving; but it's self-evident (I hope) that it should stop at re-instituting human sacrifices, or some of the more subtle horrors we read of in this book. And that fact alone should make us question some of the sillier aspects of this trend.<br />The view that everyone is of equal worth, that freedom, accountability, and responsibility are important clues about what it means to be human. The dangers inherent in free will, and the element of curiosity sometimes recalls the Garden of Eden, but this is no Paradise. The problems of humanity, it is shown, lie squarely within.lasting Hills&quot; by Thomas Cahill.) No culture is meant to live in statis, nor can it be done.

To claim that Denton has been &quot;converted&quot; to evolutionism is either a serious misreading or deliberate misrepresentation. Perhaps the following, from the conclusion of &quot;Nature's Destiny,&quot; will suffice to demonstrate:<br />&quot;All the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition of traditional natural theology--that the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose, a whole in which all facets of reality, from the size of galaxies to the thermal capacity of water, have their meaning and explanation in this central fact.&quot;(p. 389)<br />Can Denton's stance be any more clearer than this? Perhaps. He does say that &quot;to get from a single cell to Homo Sapiens has taken about 4 billion years&quot;. Likewise, he seems to assume that evolution is responsible for the diversity and complexity of life, albeit directed by information built into the first cell, by whom or what he does not say. However, he offers little to support the notion that the origin of this first cell (and its wondrous DNA) was &quot;in some way programmed into the laws of nature ... it has to be admitted that at present, despite an enormous effort, we still have no idea how this occurred ...&quot;<br />He goes on to mention the various theories currently offered, unfortunately with a less critical eye than he should. Even the poor example of snowflakes as a highly ordered state analogous to the molecules of life is thrown a bone. This seems strange in light of the still unanswered challenges presented in his previous book, but it is an example of why evolutionism has survived-- the compartmentalization of science, whereby each scientist, assuming evolution to be proven outside his own field of expertise, discards or explains away his own contradictory findings (the &quot;knowledge filter&quot; again). We will have to be content with such excellent volumes on the subject as &quot;Forbidden Archeology&quot;,&quot;The Origin of Species Revisited&quot;, and Lubenow's &quot;Bones of Contention&quot;. However, this does not detract from the main thrust: the overwhelming evidence of design, inexplicable by &quot;natural&quot; evolution.<br />Another flaw is his requiring that &quot;evidence for believing that the world is prefabricated to the end of life&quot; must somehow contradict his own notion of &quot;special creation.&quot; Even supposing this were true, he errs in forgetting that the creation of the first cell (to use his evolutionary view) or DNA, or indeed the left-handedness of life's proteins, are in themselves worthy of being considered supernatural acts, in that they do not naturally follow from the (strangely fortituous) laws of nature in the same way as the origin of the heavier elements. He neglects to address the still unresolved (and fatal) problems regarding the early atmosphere, crucial to the origins question. In distancing himself from his perception of &quot;creationism,&quot; he exhibits similar forgetfulness when he claims that his argument is consistent with naturalistic science--&quot;that the cosmos ... can be comprehended ultimately in its entirety by human reason.&quot; But surely he does not mean to include abiogenesis and the fitness of the universe for life. Instead, one gets the impression that he is trying to be charitable to his fundamentalist Darwinian colleagues.<br />What Denton does do well is take us on a marvelous tour of how finely-tuned the universe is to allow us to exist. He does this in far greater detail than most other books of this kind. He covers such &quot;coincidences&quot; as the many fortituous (and anomolous) properties of water, independent yet working together tosupport life; the fine-tuning of physical constants; suspicious dovetailing of nuclear resonances; the fitness of carbon and other elements for life; the complexity and inexplicability of DNA and proteins; etc. As we read about the ingenuity employed at the molecular level for the sending of nerve signals, manipulation of electrons, conveyance of oxygen, and so on, and the many such contrivances that are essential for life, we are struck by the overwhelming, mind-boggling complexity of it all, and the sneaking suspicion that much is taken on faith in evolutionistic circles. And we see immediately that it cannot be an informed faith based on any scientific evidence, but rather a wishful, forced belief that such nanomachines could have arisen by chance. By the time we have recovered from our revelations about water and carbon, how wonderfully fit they are for our existence, by the time we are finished reading about proteins and the cell, it seems an impossibility that life, being so complex as it is, could have arisen at all, even if it were created by some supernatural being; for this being would have to be possessed of an intellect that beggars our minds. We are used to thinking of cells as simple blobs of protoplasmic jelly, as did Darwin; not so. Now we can understand wny the intricate requirements of life are usually glossed over in popularized treatments on evolution: either the knowledge was not available then, or the inclusion of it would have made evolution impossible, even ridiculous, to defend.<br />However, details even creationists take for granted are scrutinized, leaving us with a sense of awe (or gnashing of teeth): the fitness of the visual spectrum for vision; the design of the hand; our body dimensions and bipedal gait, allowing us to use fire and thus develop technology; our capacity for language; and so on. In doing so he shows us that the &quot;chance&quot; so casually spoken of in evolutionism quickly diminishes to absurdity upon open-minded examination of our cosmos; and that, indeed, we were meant to discover this fact.<br />This compilation of smoking guns makes for an always fascinating, always interesting read, bound to raise much ire in evolutionistic circles.

What does this mean? If it means Dawkins' extreme emotional investment in Darwinism and what he thinks is science (exclusion of a Designer from our understanding of the cosmos at any and all costs) to the detriment of his logical faculties, then this description could be apt. Many \\"hard-core scientists\\" of this type, failing to practice true, critical, honest, science, were fooled by the crudely faked Piltdown Man for 40 years. But this is not the type of pop science we need.<br /><br />And how serenely objective is he really when he calls religious people wicked?<br /><br />In \\"How Blind is the Watchmaker,\\" Broom and Dembski show that Dawkins is easily confused, and in turn sows confusion and lazy thinking in the guise of science. He attributes choice and purpose to genes and other nonsentient objects; he sees the results of his intelligent design and choice (biomorphs) and confuses this with a demonstration of random chance; he glosses over the horrendous problems associated with the creation of new genetic information with vague \\"explanations.\\" Is this science? I hope not.<br /><br />Dawkins is obviously not ignorant. His many titbits of biological knowledge are indicative of a mind that has much potential. But his religious attachment to Darwinism - and atheism - has blinded him to the glaring flaws in his arguments. And apart from his perhaps unconscious infusion of a kind of mysterious vitalism to genes and other unthinking aggregations of matter, they are not subtle flaws. (More detailed exposes of his logical and scientific errors may be found at TrueOrigins and Access Research Network (ARN).)<br /><br />In the end, he still refuses to address the scientific objections raised by agnostics such as Richard Milton (\\"Shattering the Myths of Darwinism\\") and Michael Denton (\\"Evolution: A Theory in Crisis\\"), and theists such as Michael Behe (\\"Darwin's Black Box\\"). He refuses to debate Behe publicly on the grounds that, unlike Behe, molecular biology is not his specialty - and it shows.<br /><br />Dawkins' \\"explanations\\" are shining examples of what Behe calls \\"Calvinism\\" - that, like the heroes of the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, we tend to think that the internals of things are simple. Thus a light-sensitive spot is \\"simple,\\" a view which conveniently ignores the tremendous complexity of such a \\"simple\\" system. Dawkins would have us think, like Darwin, that cells are just blobs of protoplasm. Well, we could accept such a view, but that would not be science. Dawkins would have us believe that organisms spontaneously evolve new, useful genetic information, but, ironically, today this requires a leap of faith beyond what would be needed in Darwin's time (when we thought cells were simple). (See Lee Spetner's \\"Not By Chance\\" for an explanation of why examples such as bacterial mutations and the Galapagos finches do not - scientifically - constitute valid examples.)<br /><br />In fact, when Dawkins was asked on camera to name a single observed example of new, beneficial structures arising from mutation, he fell silent, then later wrote an angry screed about how he was tricked. (He also changed some of the facts about the interview. See \\"Skeptics Choke on Frog\\". NOTE: The evidence of his twisting of facts was fortunately caught on tape!) I would not trust him too much, let alone with my eternal soul.<br /><br />Dawkins is touted as the foremost apostle of Darwinism today. But Philip Johnson was converted from his agnosticism and evolutionism while reading Dawkins, as he began to realize the logical and scientific blunders of Dawkins' books.

Nowhere are such statements elaborated upon; the existence of the first cell is assumed, thereby glossing over one of the greatest frustrations in current biology. He sprinkles such religious statements liberally throughout, instead of questioning, as Behe did in &quot;Darwin's Black Box.&quot; However, his accounts of the scientific details of the cell are fairly clear and fascinating, with some neatly done illustrations; and so this book becomes, unwittingly, a perfect companion to Behe's &quot;Darwin's Black Box.&quot;<br />His scientific rigorousness is spotty - but not unusual for an evolutionist. In keeping with outdated evolutionist &quot;science&quot;, he presents Haeckel's now-discredited, faked embryo drawings as proof of evolution ('Embryonic fraud lives on', New Scientist 155(2098):23, September 6, 1997).<br />But the further one reads, the more the skeptical mind is inclined to question, &quot;How,&quot; &quot;When,&quot; and &quot;Why&quot;. For example, he describes the intracellular transportation network early on. This leads us to question, when reading that this molecule or that vesicle has to move from here to there, just how does it do this, what means of locomotion does it employ, and how is this orchestrated purely in terms of proteins and such? He does a generally good job of anticipating these questions, although each answer adds to the implausibility of the system developing by chance. But the more interesting question, &quot;How did these systems originate?&quot; is glossed over with &quot;It evolved.&quot;<br />Elsewhere, he says that the processes of life are &quot;no more mysterious, though often far more complex and wondrous, than the crystallization of water molecules into snowflakes. ... their formation is obviously no miracle.&quot; A strangely scientifically naive view (but not uncommon among fundamentalist Darwinists), he has ironically missed the point of his own book.<br />He does not realize that his very own descriptions of the workings of the cell, to the open, skeptical mind, most certainly do point to a miracle.riginate?&quot; is glossed over with &quot;It evolved.&quot;<br />Elsewhere, he says that the processes of life are &quot;no more mysterious, though often far more complex and wondrous, than the crystallization of water molecules into snowflakes. ... their formation is obviously no miracle.&quot; A strangely scientifically naive view (but not uncommon among fundamentalist Darwinists), he has ironically missed the point of his own book.<br />He does not realize that his very own descriptions of the workings of the cell, to the open, skeptical mind, most certainly do point to a miracle.	2001-03-17

An astounding witness to the strength and love the living Christ imparts, and an indictment of the horror and hollowness of atheism.

Lee Strobel interviews eight impressively credentialled scholars - some former atheists? - and, through captivating dialogue, shows how Christianity still provides the most intellectually satisfying answers. Honest skeptics will be encouraged on their road to faith, as Strobel was, and believers will marvel at the coherence of their beliefs, in the face of these difficult questions.<br /> Not all the answers will be tidily wrapped up in a neat package - each issue is worthy of several books - but we are given much (meat-and-potatoes) food for thought, and nonbelievers will be exposed to a depth of thought which, while common in conservative theological circles (they have to try to make sense of reality, warts and all, after all), is rarely seen in pseudo-skeptical circles.<br /> He also discusses the problem regarding the sincerity (or lack thereof) behind some objections - that some simply do not want to believe, no matter what, and hide behind supposed objections (as he once did himself). (This explains the overall poor quality of argument and reasoning readily apparent on sites like talkorigins. How can one love science, on the one hand, yet ignore, distort or dilute it when it contradicts/falsifies evolution?)<br /> A book much needed in an age where much puerility (&quot;There are no absolutes!&quot; etc.) passes for &quot;intellectual&quot; atheism.	2001-01-03

Discusses pretty much the same topics as &quot;Learn ...&quot;, with a little more detail regarding connecting, and shows us an actual game with commentary, which was very helpful in getting a better sense of how the game is played. &quot;Learn to Play Go&quot; is also an excellent place to start.	2001-01-03

Just as absorbing in its portrayal not only of the machinations of Battle School and its adult leaders, but of the lives of children as they really are, even the killers (which was what shocked many adults - and got them hysterical - about Ender's Game).

He's never afraid to throw at us new ideas, concepts, and information, challenging our notions of what we thought we knew. Contrary to popular opinion, he shows us a vibrant, scary, energetic, intelligent Middle Ages - where people were just as smart, devious, screwed up, and dangerous, and often were stronger, healthier, and faster (much as Neanderthal Man had a bigger brain and incredibly strong musculature compared to \\"modern\\" man), and combat was fast and furious, not plodding knights slowly swinging unwieldy swords (See HACA for more on this).<br />His time travel method, though (as he admits) is squarely in the realm of fantasy, nevertheless captivates our imagination. And although you may not much care for his characters (at least, the ones from our era - the medieval ones, especially minor characters, grow on you), you'll certainly be caught up in their predicaments.	2001-01-03

Good for about 120 pages. But turned out to be awful, starting with the name of the hero - Lassiter! Totally wrong for  this kind of plot. Maybe I'm just fussy, but that's the kind of name for a  hard-boiled detective novel.<br />You've guessed the plot quite early on, but  Case takes you on extended investigative trips to find one person after  another. The dialogue is comic-book quality (and I don't mean Alan Moore),  quite painful to read, even worse to imagine:<br />&quot;No, she isn't dead.  She's shaken up. Shakin' like a leaf-&quot;<br />Echhhh.<br />You're at the end  of the book and you feel as if nothing's really happened. The  &quot;climax&quot; is ridiculous - the big bad guy comes all the way from  Italy to handle Lassiter himself, instead of sending his honchos. And you  find that the plot - the big secret - was no more earth-shattering than you  guessed much earlier.<br />It seems like the main point of this book is to  show you the author's expertise in tracking people down.

Why, for example, did Dubois, &quot;discoverer&quot; of Java Man, hide some of his finds for years? Why were scientists fooled by Piltdown ... for **40 years**? Why do paleoanthropologists get away with sloppiness that would get them tarred and feathered in any other field of science?<br />If the Kanapoi elbow fossil is &quot;indistinguishable&quot; from modern man's, and the Lateoli footprints identical to ours, why haven't we revised our beliefs in human origins?<br />Why do scientists lament that hominid remains are too scarce for a solid picture to be painted - the sum total of which is regularly depicted as fitting on a pool table - when there are 4,000 or more hominid finds? What do they really mean, then?<br />Oh - and how could one lineage be shown to have evolved into another when - surprise - all of them have always been found to have existed contemporaneously?<br />Lubenow writes in an immensely readable style laced with a dry, understated humor. Even if you're not interested in the material, he's fun to read.<br />The book contains the painstaking fruit of his research - a chart showing Homo erectus, homo habilis, etc. finds, showing (according to evolutionary dating) they lived side by side - and why no book on evolutionary biology contains a similar chart. Damn, but science (real science) is fun.	2000-04-28

See Piltdown, Galileo, Cont'l Drift ...	... and other issues the &quot;scientific&quot; majority was stunningly wrong about.  But &quot;majority rules&quot; is still the essence of Darwinist argument, as Foley (in the talkorigins debate and this book) demonstrates.<br />The debate between Foley and Milton was enlightening.  Apparently &quot;trashed&quot; has the meaning of &quot;was overwhelmed  with pseudoscientific pronouncements&quot;; it is not hard to imagine  Milton throwing up his hands in despair, shaking his head at the  pseudoscience that Darwinists employ, as in this rebuke to  Foley:<br />&quot;Yours is a remarkable view of scientific knowledge. You  define 'known' as a matter of acceptance by a majority (&quot;all or almost  all workers in the field&quot;.) I regard science as being essentially  about proof and my definition of &quot;known&quot; is not that most workers  agree, but that the scientific evidence leads inescapably to unambiguous  conclusions -- regardless of how many are willing to accept those  conclusions.&quot;<br />If only Darwinists would finally use such a high  standard of proof. But this only underscores the religious nature of  Darwinism ...<br />While I am ignorant of his personal (noncreationist)  worldview, I must applaud him for his stance, calling for a return to true  scientific standards rather than bullying,  pseudoskepticism (his web site  links to CSICOP's embarrassing failure to debunk an astrological study!)  and turning a blind eye to &quot;naughty&quot; data.<br />His rebuttals to  Foley's and other Darwinist claims are concise, a pleasure to read, and,  sadly, often expose basic logical flaws. Imagine these flaws distributed  and magnified over thousands of man-hours, by faithful devotees of Darwin,  and the resulting magnitude of  groupthink that Milton seeks to cure in  this book. For Piltdown, it took almost 40 years; but with the likes of  Behe, Cremo, Denton, and others, this book is an important addition to  science's struggle against evolutionism.	2000-02-24

The evidence was all there - the term Neo-Darwinism was openly used to  describe Nazi racial theories. The expression &quot;natural  selection,&quot; as applied to human beings, turns up at the Wannsee  Conference in the prime document of the Holocaust ...&quot; (John  Koster)<br /> But today we recoil at this legacy of Darwin. We are desperate  to believe evolutionism, and Dennett (somewhat) enables us to have our cake  and eat it too. We read and are assured that our lives still have meaning,  that we can hold on to our little moralities, which would otherwise be  nothing more than the product of chance and circumstance. (If Hitler had  won, we would be learning a different brand of Darwinism, instead of this  &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; version.)<br /> So swallow it all - it may not be  true or logical, or even really science at all, but at least you won't  become a monster (even a hopeful one).<br /> &quot;I am convinced ... that  Darwinism ... is not in fact a scientific theory, but a pseudo-metaphysical  hypothesis decked out in scientific garb.

He also refers to them as 'quasi-biological' forms and in a  moment of excitement calls them 'exquisite creatures'. He plainly believes  that in some way they correspond to the real world of living animals and  insects.<br /> &quot;Why is this an example of pseudoscience?<br /><br />&quot;In  reality, the biomorphs  do not correspond in any way at all with living  things, except in the purely trivial way that Dawkins sees some resemblance  in their shapes. The only thing about the 'biomorphs' that is biological is  Richard Dawkins, their creator. ...<br /> &quot;The program he wrote and the  computer he used have no analog at all in the real biological world.  Indeed, if he set out to create an experiment that simulates evolution, he  has only succeeded in making one that simulates special creation, with  himself in the omnipotent role.<br /> &quot;His program is not a true  representation of random mutation coupled with natural selection. On the  contrary it is dependent on artificial selection in which he controls the  rate of occurrence of mutations. Despite Dawkins's own imaginative  interpretations, and even with the deck stacked in his favour, his  biomorphs show no real novelty arising -- no cases of bears turning into  whales.<br /> &quot;Most important of all, it is Dawkins, not blind fate,  who chooses which are the lucky individuals to receive the next mutation  and of course he chooses the most promising ones ('I began to breed ...  from whichever child looked most like an insect.') That is why they have  ended up looking like recognizable images from his memory. If his mutations  really occurred randomly, as in the real world, Dawkins would still be  sitting in front of his screen watching a small dot and waiting for it do  something.&quot;<br /> Does a Sighted Watchmaker exist?

He plainly believes  that in some way they correspond to the real world of living animals and  insects.<br /> &quot;Why is this an example of pseudoscience?<br /><br />&quot;In  reality, the biomorphs  do not correspond in any way at all with living  things, except in the purely trivial way that Dawkins sees some resemblance  in their shapes. The only thing about the 'biomorphs' that is biological is  Richard Dawkins, their creator. ...<br /> &quot;The program he wrote and the  computer he used have no analog at all in the real biological world.  Indeed, if he set out to create an experiment that simulates evolution, he  has only succeeded in making one that simulates special creation, with  himself in the omnipotent role.<br /> &quot;His program is not a true  representation of random mutation coupled with natural selection. On the  contrary it is dependent on artificial selection in which he controls the  rate of occurrence of mutations. Despite Dawkins's own imaginative  interpretations, and even with the deck stacked in his favour, his  biomorphs show no real novelty arising -- no cases of bears turning into  whales.<br /> &quot;Most important of all, it is Dawkins, not blind fate,  who chooses which are the lucky individuals to receive the next mutation  and of course he chooses the most promising ones ('I began to breed ...  from whichever child looked most like an insect.') That is why they have  ended up looking like recognizable images from his memory. If his mutations  really occurred randomly, as in the real world, Dawkins would still be  sitting in front of his screen watching a small dot and waiting for it do  something.&quot;<br /> Does a Sighted Watchmaker exist? The difference with  me is: I really don't care one way or another. But it happens that the  evidence supports his existence.<br /> The problem with Dawkinism, of course,  is described by Behe: we humans tend to think that the contents of  &quot;black boxes&quot; are simple: imagining that a system as complex as  the first living cell could arise complete, by accident, for example.  Dawkinists dare not go any further, as it would imperil their beliefs. But  I don't have as much faith.do  something.&quot; <br /> Does a Sighted Watchmaker exist?

US	50516684	R3MXJNHRSQYN51	0930289234	777411096	Watchmen	Books	5	0	4	N	N	Complex and engaging	Wonderfully realized with vivid, interesting, believable characters. A wild, thoughtful ride, complete with a coherent alternate history that integrates the superheroes well.<br /> Great artwork by Gibbons, with many  memorable images. Great parallel framing and dialogue. Probably spurred  Miller to create something comparable (... unfortunately resulting in his  PC-heavy &quot;Martha Washington&quot; series).<br /> But why stop with comic  books? Although Moore's stuff is always interesting, most comic-book  philosophy is at the pop level. Sounds deep and attractively cynical ...  until you delve. (Thankfully, Moore forgoes such pontifications here.) Read  something serious. Recommendations: &quot;Darwin's Black Box&quot; (Behe),  &quot;Nature's Destiny&quot; (Denton).	1999-12-13

In fact, unless you're into extreme political correctness, you won't like this one.<br /> All the good guys are minorities. All the bad and dumb  ones are white. And so on. This seems like an 180-degree reversal from his  Batman books, which were somewhat negative on liberal issues (well,  justice, at least).<br /> But Miller obviously wanted it to be a work on par  with Moore's &quot;Watchmen&quot; - why else waste Gibbon's talent on this  book? Perhaps it was a catharsis, because it seems like a lot of venting -  against Reagan, against white males, against evil phallic space stations,  against ... well, enough said. Read &quot;Watchmen&quot; again instead. Or  why waste time with comic books? Although Moore's stuff is always  interesting, most comic-book philosophy is at the pop level. Sounds deep  and attractively cynical ... until you delve. Read something serious.  Recommendations: &quot;Darwin's Black Box&quot; (Behe), &quot;Nature's  Destiny&quot; (Denton).	1999-12-13
