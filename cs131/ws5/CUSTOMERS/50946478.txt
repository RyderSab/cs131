It concerns sixteenth century scholar Michael Servetus and his book Christianismi Restituto in which Servetus recounts his discovery of pulmonary circulation well before Harvey, the man usually credited with the discovery.  In The Friar and the Cipher the Goldstone's attempt a similar look at history through the lens of important books with Roger Bacon and a book known as the Voynich manuscript.<br /><br />The Voynich manuscript is a mystery.  Discovered in 1912, this book has remained unfathomable for nearly a century.  Not only is it a strange concoction of drawings and diagrams but it is also written in a code that has remained unbroken since its discovery despite the efforts of some of the greatest code-breakers of the twentieth century.  In fact, no one is even sure who the author of the manuscript is, though one of the likeliest of authors is thirteenth century proto-scientist Roger Bacon.<br /><br />This gives the authors an opportunity to test the claim by going through a history of thirteenth century scholarship.  Roger Bacon, the friar of the title, is ostensibly the main subject but the Goldstone's are going for much more.  We learn about the revival of Aristotle and Plato in Western Europe during the Middle Ages.  We learn about the rise of the universities the new religious orders like the Dominicans and Franciscans.  And we learn about many of the other great thinkers of the age like Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus as well as a host of lesser known names, if no less influential thinkers.<br /><br />It is a wonderful history and fun to read but somewhat less satisfying than Out of the Flames, mainly because there is an uncertainty here that wasn't in the previous book.  With Christianismi Restituto, the provenance of the remaining three manuscripts and the fact that Servetus was the author is not in doubt.  Out of the Flames traced a known history and revived the reputation of a man whose name is unjustly forgotten.  Roger Bacon may be no less deserving of having his name polished for modern readers; however, bringing Bacon to life through this manuscript is less convincing.  As the authors allow, there is no proof that Bacon is the author of this manuscript.  In fact, it may have been written centuries after him.  And since no one knows what this book is actually about, there is no proof that the author was some sort of genius.  He may have simply been very clever at creating codes and ciphers, which comes across as rather pointless if no one can even decipher the code.<br /><br />Ultimately, this book is a good one with a lot of interesting history and some information about a literary mystery that still remains unsolved.  That alone makes it worth reading.  And if it's not the Goldstone's best, it is still excellent.  And it leaves one wondering what the Goldstones are going to tackle next.n of a man whose name is unjustly forgotten.

It turns out, I had read a book by a different author with the same title as one of Mr. Preston's books.  See what happens when you read too much and browse too often?  Anyway, I got a chance to check out an author I had never read before and I had a reasonably good time doing it.<br /><br />The premise is kind of fun: a fossil hunter finds the holy grail of fossils--a complete T. Rex skeleton.  Before he can take advantage of his find, he is killed.  Then, it becomes a race to see who among the competitors is going to decode the prospectors notes and locate the T. Rex, all of whom are seeking it for a different reason.<br /><br />The problem with the book is that it really pushes credibility beyond the limit.  It's like a mishmash of genres--science fiction, CIA thriller, psycho killer story, conspiracy theory, etc. which adds up to beyond believability.  And some of the characters!--A multi-millionaire hiding as a veterinarian, a CIA agent turned monk, a killer who runs an Internet site for dating convicts.  And that doesn't even touch the surface of the parade of crazies that run through this far-fetched tale.  And the plot twists!--where is the T. Rex?  Where else?  Tyrannosaur Canyon.  And a \\"extra secret\\" division of the CIA formed in response to a moon rock?  Too much.  I'm also not a big fan of prose that lingers over the names and details of firearms, which seems to happen a lot in this novel.<br /><br />Still, I don't want to judge a story to harshly that I take to be meant as nothing more than a thrill ride.  Mysteries are played out and there are plenty of twists and turns.  And many of the characters are fun to spend time with though I have a fondness for those that don't push it too far into the impossible, like Melodie Crookshank, the geeky scientist who analyzes the fossil.  And then there's the happy ending, which I liked despite its complete ridiculousness.  To sum up, if you're looking for a bit of thrilling fluff, then this may be the book for you; otherwise, look elsewhere.plete ridiculousness.

Gioia is known as a craftsman who publishes little because of his struggle bring every poem to the highest state of perfection.  In fact, as one reads these poems, it is almost possible to sense how carefully every word has been chosen.  In some cases, this almost becomes distracting, to the detriment of the poetry.<br /><br />On the other hand, through his struggle Gioia is able to create some brilliant lines within poems whose overall effect is something less:  \\"With eyes that have forgotten how to see/From viewing things already too well-known\\" from \\"Entrance.\\" Or \\"The future shrinks/Whether the past/Is well or badly spent\\" from \\"Curriculum Vitae.\\"  Within poems like \\"Pentecost\\" and \\"Three Songs for Nosferatu\\" it is possible to find some wonderful work as well.<br /><br />In this collection, however, there are two poems that I think are wonderful through and through.  In \\"Juno Plots Her Revenge\\" Gioia takes us on a long rant as Juno lists her complaints against Jupiter's unfaithfulness and plans her final revenge against Hercules, one of Jupiter's bastards.  Poems with classical references are often fun because the poet is able to let his hair down and be bold using a mythological goddess as a mouthpiece.  There is more energy and engaging language in this longer poem than in almost all of Gioia's other poems put together.  Wonderful!<br /><br />But my favorite poem in this collection may be \\"My Dead Lover.\\"  In it, Gioia writes of a person mourning a great love (\\"Your body was the first I ever knew/Better than my own.\\") with whom he really didn't get along (\\"How miserable we were together, dear\\").  And yet he mourns anyway despite the fact that he was abandoned in this final way, without being allowed a chance to regret.  Finally, he realizes \\"Our rituals are never for the dead.\\"  The dead are beyond caring but he must still make his peace with it.  It is a very well done poem to which most of us can relate.<br /><br />All in all, this is a collection well worth reading.  There is no denying that Gioia is a real craftsman, no matter how one may ultimately feel about some of the poems.  And there are some gems here that a poetry connoisseur should be loathe to miss.it.

I was so moved by it that I decided to read the entire book.  I'm glad I did because it is a wonderful piece of writing.<br /><br />In this memoir, the poet Donald Hall tells of his relationship with the poet Jane Kenyon.  In it, he tells of meeting her, marrying her, living with her (first in Michigan and then in New Hampshire) and, finally, losing her to leukemia.  \\"The Best Day The Worst Day\\" comes from a chapter in the book where, after a day when Ms. Kenyon seems to be recovering and doing well, they receive the news that her cancer will be terminal.  However, it is also an appropriate title for the book because Mr. Hall alternates beautiful chapters of the \\"healthy\\" parts of their relationship with more harrowing chapters describing Ms. Kenyon's progressing illness.<br /><br />This is not a memoir for the faint of heart.  Though there are beautiful passages of love and joy and living together in a rustic farmhouse in New Hampshire, death runs through the entire book, not only because we already know Ms. Kenyon's ultimate fate but also because her death is not the only one.  Both Ms. Kenyon's mother and Mr. Hall's mother are elderly and, trying to take care of them and their ultimate passing just before Ms. Kenyon's is a strong thread in the book.  There is also Mr. Hall's own cancer which is diagnosed a few years before Ms. Kenyon's that overshadows events.  Ironically, Mr. Hall's cancer was expected to be fatal and yet he has managed to survive.<br /><br />How he has done so is somewhat of a mystery.  The avalanche of tragedy that Mr. Hall experiences has destroyed others.  But Mr. Hall has managed not only to continue but also to produce this wonderful work.  Perhaps only those who have suffered through cancer the way Mr. Hall has can fully appreciate this work.  Certainly, it is difficult to get through it more than a few chapters at a time.  In the end, however, the model of Mr. Hall's strength and perseverance are something I think any reader will appreciate.strength and perseverance are something I think any reader will appreciate.	2005-08-26
US	50946478	RBNDU7X660HIH	0393060454	577480563	The Plot: The Secret Story of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (Will Eisner Library (Hardcover))	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Well Drawn History	Subtitled \\"The Secret Story of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\\" this last work by the great graphic artist Will Eisner is not a graphic novel, which may surprise some.  It is, in fact, a work of history and research told through the form of graphic art.  As such, it is a strong work.<br /><br />As the subtitle implies, Mr. Eisner shows that \\"The Protocols,\\" rather than being a program of Jewish world-domination, is actually an early twentieth century work of plagiarism based on an even earlier French anti-government tract by Maurice Joly called \\"The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu.\\"  \\"The Protocols\\" was written in an attempt to manipulate Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to follow anti-modernization policies.  Since then, it has become an important part of the propaganda of anti-Semitism despite the fact that it is entirely fake.<br /><br />If there is a weakness in this book, it is that there is an emotional underpinning to the \\"debate\\" on \\"The Protocols\\" and, despite the fact that graphic art would seem to lend itself to generating some passion and emotion, this book doesn't take advantage of that.  The main emotional trigger sounded in this book is the deep sadness surrounding the fact that another book is needed to show that \\"The Protocols\\" are fake even though this was first shown conclusively in 1921 and has been done repeatedly since.  Perhaps Mr. Eisner stays away from emotion because he wants the focus to stay on fact and history; however, as history shows, facts alone are often not enough to make people aware and convince them.<br /><br />Still, this is a well-written, well-drawn book that is a very interesting read.  Admittedly, though I had heard of \\"The Protocols\\" and knew something of their history, this book filled in a lot of gaps for me.  Hopefully, this book may be a last chapter on a sad hoax.  Sadly, it probably won't be.  But it will stand as another strong voice of truth always waiting to be heard.	2005-08-26

In our fast-paced world it's hard to beat a good laugh so when I saw this book I decided to give it a try.  As I expected, I had a few good laughs.  Certainly enough to recommend the book.<br /><br />I wouldn't say I'm a big fan of Bill Maher.  Though I think he does try to keep it somewhat under control, there is an overt streak of hostility that runs through his comedy that I do not enjoy.  In particular, his hostility towards religion and marriage is something which I try to respect but do not share.  That is why I find some of his writing more offensive than funny; however, I've never found this enough to reject anyone's work.  He often digs out some funny, truthful insights and I want to be challenged by ideas other than my own.  It makes my ideas stronger.<br /><br />Still, it is easy to understand why so many people do not like Mr. Maher at all.  But if you do not like Mr. Maher's comedy, why are you even reading this?  You won't like the book.  But if you get a chuckle from an extreme libertarian view of the world, then this book is worth the brief amount of time it takes to get through it.	2005-08-16

That said, this book is probably the least good in the series so far.  I say this for one major reason: until the last 100 pages, nothing much happens.<br /><br />Granted, it's fun to see the relationships develop between Ron & Hermione and Harry & Ginny.  And Ms. Rowling offers some intrigue with the half-blood prince's potion book and the unknown nature of Snape's unbreakable vow interspersed between the typical quidditch matches and school ups and downs.  And yet, this book is a tougher row to hoe than the previous volumes.<br /><br />Until, that is, the last 100 pages.  Here we have the revelations and excitement that have made the Harry Potter series so successful.  I will not give anything away, of course, but, needless to say, these last pages are worth the work to get there.<br /><br />It's difficult to quibble with a novelist as successful as Rowling.  Still, it will be interesting to see where this book stands when it finds its place within the soon-to-be completed canon of Harry Potter.	2005-08-15
US	50946478	R1C1D2M6K7TX28	0316011770	454028739	The Historian	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Chasing Dracula	This is not a typical vampire tale.  The reader expecting something along the lines of an Anne Rice or Stephen King horror novel is going to be sorely disappointed.  However, the reader looking for a mysterious, dark tale of intriguing characters will find much to enjoy.<br /><br />In essence, this is three stories of three generations of encounters with Vlad the Impaler, a.k.a. Dracula.  First, in the 1930's, Professor Bartholomew Rossi encounters a book, blank but for a detailed dragon image which compels him to research vampires.  Then in the 1950's, Paul & Helen, Rossi's student and daughter respectively, take up Rossi's chase when Rossi disappears and another copy of the dragon book falls into Paul's hands.  Finally, Paul and Helen's daughter (the narrator of this book) takes up the chase in the 1970's when her father resumes the chase of her long-disappeared mother.<br /><br />If you haven't figured it out yet, this extensive novel, told mostly through flashbacks and letters, is the story of a chase.  Vlad remains firmly offstage until the last part of the novel as clues are revealed and many sights in Europe are explored.  Even Vlad's minions are only minor characters meant to keep a shadow of menace over the proceedings while the history of this fascinating legend is explored.  In fact, one begins to wonder whether these characters aren't being led on a wild goose chase until Vlad does make a brief but menacing appearance.  Rossi's encounter with Vlad and the discovery of the tomb are the highlight of the novel for me, even over the shootout and reunion at the very end of the book.<br /><br />Somehow the denouement doesn't seem quite worth the effort because the end of the novel falls in place so suddenly after the winding road to get there.  Still, in an era where many \\"novels\\" clock in at barely 200 pages, it is nice to be able to become involved with well-drawn characters and an interesting story.  This is a book with which it is well worth spending time.time.	2005-08-15

The simple answer to this question gives the title of this book (Europeans had guns, germs and steel) but that title is actually deceptive in terms of what Jared Diamond does in this book.  Though it's true that the Europeans guns, germs and steel allowed them to dominate beginning with the \\"era of exploration\\" starting with Columbus, Diamond recognizes these as proximate causes.  The primary causes are much deeper and much further back.<br /><br />It is difficult to summarize Diamond's very clever and well-researched assertions but he basically traces the success of western society to this primary cause: food production.  In the \\"fertile crescent\\" there were better and a wider variety of plants to domesticate as farming began.  This was supported by a better and wider variety of animals to domesticate which, in turn, led to more effective farming.  These domesticates spread easily along the east-west axis of Eurasia because of similarities in longitude often indicate similarities in climate.  This long presence of multiple domesticates gave rise to disease to which survivors evolved immunity but lay ready to devastate isolated populations.  And, ultimately, Europe had the incentive to progress because of divided rulers, countries and principalities than encouraged competition.<br /><br />Other areas that, at some point, could have been competitive had major strikes against them: a north-south axis (like Africa and the Americas) slowing the spread of even their limited domesticates.  Some areas (Australia, areas of Africa & the Americas) had so few domesticates that the people living there remained hunter-gatherers.  The limitation of domesticates also led to less animal-bred diseases and, therefore, immunities.  And, in countries like China, who could have been competitive with the West, were basically unified and politically stable enough that their incentive to progress was slowed.<br /><br />The previous two paragraphs do not do justice to this extraordinary work.  Like many works of genius, this book is a synthesis of ideas and information from various fields giving a comprehensive view of world development.  I have never read anything like it before and find it incredibly enlightening.  If there is a flaw in this book, it's that Diamond takes to much time to (rather plaintively) convince the reader that this is a work with value developed from scientific principles.  That should be obvious and it is sad that Diamond has to spend time outlining it.  Still, he realizes that his conclusions are subject to change based on future discoveries and new interpretations of old data but this is true of any scientific work.  That doesn't change that Mr. Diamond has written a book of brilliance that deserves to be read.the West, were basically unified and politically stable enough that their incentive to progress was slowed. <br /> <br />The previous two paragraphs do not do justice to this extraordinary work.

If, on the other hand, you come into this book looking for a peek into what is often a culture shrouded in mystery, then you will likely come away satisfied.<br /><br />Nedjma is a pseudonym of a Muslim woman writer still living in a Muslim world and The Almond purports to be a novel based on her own sexual experiences.  Badra, the narrator of this book, has run away from her horrible husband.  She flees to Tangiers where she lives with her aunt until she meets Driss, the man who will lead her to her \\"sexual awakening.\\"  She stays with Driss for a long time hoping for more from him but, in the end, is left with nothing but money and unhappiness which she then proceeds to spread around.<br /><br />The book is sometimes crude but cleverly written, alternating between her experiences growing up in a small town and her experiences in the big city.  It is at times erotic, at times surprising and often enlightening of experiences that most Americans will never understand.  However, it is also a novel of sadness and anger.  In fact, the sadness and anger color the book so much, particularly the last half, that someone looking for a purely erotic experience had better go elsewhere.  The story of Badra and her neighbor, Wafa, near the end of the book is so horrible it is difficult to keep reading.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you're looking for something more than erotica, this book offers enough insights to make it worth reading.  It is difficult to believe that the experiences of the \\"awakened\\" Badra are typical of the Muslim woman but her childhood experiences are likely widely shared.  This makes this book valuable if you can get through the deep unhappiness that the story generates..	2005-07-29

Though the point is still debated, it seems likely that syphilis was the one epidemic Native Americans were able to give to their conquerors in the face of smallpox, measles and the rest that devastated their populations.  Unlike the European diseases, however, which were quickly and disproportionately deadly, syphilis, after its sudden and sweeping introduction, quickly mutated into a chronic illness.  Though ultimately fatal in some cases, syphilis often allowed carriers to live for many decades after the initial infection, slowly tearing the body apart.  It is the story of this disease that has become largely ignored in modern scholarship that Ms. Hayden tells in Pox.<br /><br />There is much of interest in this book, particularly in the first section.  Here, Ms. Hayden recounts what is known of the introduction of syphilis into Europe, including a lively discussion indicating that Columbus himself may have been among the first syphilitics.  Even more interesting is her description of the disease itself from the signs of initial infection to the often gradual, extensive and painful deterioration that accompanies the progress of the disease ending in madness and death.  She notes that there are two key problems in an analysis of syphilis: the fact that syphilis is \\"the great imitator\\" (meaning that its extensive symptoms are often easily mistaken for other diseases, especially as these symptoms may occur decades after the initial infection) and the fact that patients admitting to syphilis was rare because of the social stigma attached.  So understanding the full impact of syphilis on Western culture is problematic.  And here is where the book becomes less compelling.<br /><br />The last two sections of the book take us through the biographies of some important syphilitics like the Lincolns (Abraham & Mary Todd), Oscar Wilde, Nietzsche, Beethoven and van Gogh.  If they are syphilitics.  In many cases it's not known for sure though Ms. Hayden attempts to make the case.  And, proved or not, she attempts to show how syphilis--if that's what it was--would have had important impact on their lives and work.  Her most extensive and controversial case surrounds that of Adolf Hitler as having been infected as a young man (possibly by a Jewish prostitute) and how the last years of World War II saw his deterioration.<br /><br />The problems with these biographies are two-fold.  First, is the simple matter of the difficulty in writing something interesting about each person.  These biographies are extraordinarily repetitious: infection and illness, latency and then steadily worsening heath problems as the spirochetes take over.  Second, they are filled with so much speculation.  Even in the rare case where syphilis is a known infection, as Ms. Hayden admits, there is no guarantee that the following health problems are syphilitic in nature.  They might be.  All of this speculation begins to make the reader wonder if this is all fact or fiction.<br /><br />Still, Ms. Hayden often makes a compelling if not entirely convincing case.  Certainly, she makes the case that it is a subject that deserves more interest, especially from biographers of these various subjects.  There is no doubt that illness can have a great impact on a person's life, art and politics and Ms. Hayden deserves credit for bringing this important disease back to light.raham & Mary Todd), Oscar Wilde, Nietzsche, Beethoven and van Gogh.

The poem is called, \\"The Foolishness of God Is Wiser Than Men.\\"  In it, Mitcham takes on \\"God's editors [who] erased what they thought not right:/...how Jesus laughed.\\"  He gives us wonderful images of a laughing Christ who is human but no less divine for sharing this most human of reactions.  Wonderful!<br /><br />It is impossible to find a collection of poems where all the poetry is of the highest quality but Mr. Mitcham comes pretty close.  I found many of these poems to be very well done; in particular, \\"History of Rain,\\" \\"Comedian,\\" \\"The Funerals of Strangers,\\" \\"Together\\" and \\"Calvin's Wife.\\"  I also very much enjoyed another poem on the theme of laughter called (surprise) \\"Laughter.\\"  In this poem we are given accounts of laughter in the face of horror and tragedy which are very moving, especially in the first three sections.<br /><br />There are a number of recurring themes in these poems:  the loss of his father, the placement of his mother in a nursing home and the solaces of religion.  Ultimately, however, there is a joy and gentleness that is an undercurrent to these poems that brings you back to them despite the presence of loss and death.  This is a very fine collection.	2005-07-21

This book, Dawn, is sometimes referred to as a sequel to Night; however, I think that is misleading.  Though readers of Night will see the influence of the author's concentration camp experience reflected in this book, Dawn is something very different.<br /><br />The most obvious difference, of course, is that Night is nonfiction whereas Dawn is a novel.  Dawn tells the story of Elisha, a Holocaust survivor, who is recruited to a terrorist group in Palestine that is trying to drive out the British in the years after World War II.  After participating in a number of terrorist activities without remorse, Elisha is assigned to execute a prisoner in retaliation for the execution of one of his comrades.  As he waits through the night for his task at dawn, Elisha struggle (literally) with his ghosts.<br /><br />When faced with an author like Wiesel who has written a classic piece of nonfiction like Night, it is often difficult to judge his fiction fairly.  The fiction doesn't seem to have the same impact.  And though I, too, prefer Night, I found this book to be powerful in its own right.  Dawn gives real insight into how people can be haunted and changed by an unfathomable trauma.  In addition, it addresses real philosophical issues such as when does killing become murder and how does becoming a murderer change a person?  Does suffering unto death justify a (some might say) disproportionate response?<br /><br />In these post 9/11 days, I also found the insight into the terrorist mindset very interesting.  The American revolutionaries and the Zionists were considered terrorists in their day much as the Palestinians and al Queda are today and, though there are obviously differences between all these groups, there are some attitudes that run through all who can find it in themselves to use terror tactics.  It is fascinating to see words come from the mouths of these young Jewish partisans that would fit equally well in the mouths of Palestinians today.<br /><br />All in all, Dawn is an excellent work: brief but powerful.s of these young Jewish partisans that would fit equally well in the mouths of Palestinians today. <br /> <br />All in all, Dawn is an excellent work: brief but powerful.	2005-07-19

Her ability to evoke a spiritualism in a modern Asian context is fascinating to me.  And her prose has a gentleness even in the face of stories of tragedy that I find soothing.<br /><br />So it is with the two stories in this volume.  In \\"Hardboiled\\" we have a young woman hiking and spending the night in a hotel on the anniversary of a friend/former lover's death.  In the hotel she dreams of her friend and encounters the ghost of another woman who has committed suicide in the hotel.  In \\"Hard Luck\\" we have a young woman whose sister is dying in a hospital because of an embolism and she is about to be taken off life support.  In the course of the vigil and through the funeral she encounters the brother of her dead sister's fianc&eacute; and feels the first stirrings of love--the realization that life must go on.<br /><br />Of course, my summaries do not do these stories justice.  As always, Ms. Yoshimoto has produced simple, yet beautiful and truthful stories.  My complaint is the dearth of text here.  Almost all of Ms. Yoshimoto's books are brief but it amazes me the publishers had the nerve to put these two stories between hardcovers and price them what they did.  Another couple stories of this caliber would have made it much more worthwhile.  It's difficult not to feel you're getting a bit cheated.	2005-07-18

Not only is the story a fascinating one but also it is structured in a very clever way that gives the reader emotional satisfaction as well as a bit of shaking-up.<br /><br />The first part of the story goes as follows: in the years before the Second World War Robbie, a brilliant young man, the son of a charwoman, falls in love with the elder daughter of his mother's employer, Cecilia.  They don't know how to communicate with each other but a wayward letter reveals all.  Unfortunately, the letter is intercepted by the younger daughter, Briony, who is a daydreamer (future writer) and is shocked by what is happening.  When a young cousin turns up raped, Briony uses the letter and a convincing lie to get the innocent Robbie sent to prison.<br /><br />Though interesting, the first part of the story is nothing compared to what is to come: Robbie out of jail and fighting in France, unable to be more that a grunt despite his education because of his conviction.  Cecilia remains loyal to Robbie, becomes a nurse and cuts herself off from her family.  Briony, now older and wiser, follows her sister into the nursing corps and tries to make-up for the disaster she has caused.  Thus, the title of the novel.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal too much but, needless to say, it's incredible.  Experiences are had and many truths are revealed and many truths the reader seems to be sure of are shown to be false.  McEwan is able to manage this feat through a constant shifting of points of view--we see the same event constantly reinterpreted and motivations we thought we understood are re-evaluated.  In the first part we see the story unfold through the eyes of Briony, Cecilia, Robbie and Mrs. Tallis (Briony & Cecilia's mother).  The second part we see through Robbie's eyes and the third part through Briony's.  Part four (London, 1999) is also seen through Briony's eyes but it is in this brief epilogue that our final certainties are shaken-up and we are made to reconsider everything.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I've read a novel that I've enjoyed so much.  Not only for it's clever, well-told story and brilliant characters but also for the technical achievement in the prose.  McEwan shows himself to be a true literary master with this book.s in this brief epilogue that our final certainties are shaken-up and we are made to reconsider everything. <br /> <br />It has been a long time since I've read a novel that I've enjoyed so much.

As a high school science teacher, I try to give my students some knowledge of the important figures of scientific history.  Standing as one of the giants of nineteenth century science is the subject of this book, Michael Faraday.<br /><br />Faraday's rise to the top of the scientific world is an interesting one.  The son of a blacksmith, Faraday was apprenticed at an early age to a bookbinder.  During his apprenticeship, however, he became interested in science through the popular public lectures on the subject and likely through reading some of the books he was binding.  As his apprenticeship came to an end, Faraday tried to apprentice himself to a scientist and, through both hard work and good luck, attached himself to one of the most important scientists of the day, Humphrey Davy.<br /><br />While working with Davy, Faraday learned the fundamentals of scientific research, demonstrating extraordinary ability as an experimentalist.  In time, Faraday became his own man, achieving a place of honor at the Royal Institution where he loyally remained for the rest of his career.  During that time, he made a number of important discoveries, including the basics of electromagnetism, developing the prototype of the modern electric generator among other devices that will become integral to our modern society.  He also made a name for himself as a popular lecturer on science whose fame at the time could only be equaled by Charles Dickens.  Through this, he made known his lifelong belief in universal scientific education for the young.  Most significantly, he did this all with minimal formal schooling leaving him forever limited in some respects such as mathematical ability.<br /><br />James Hamilton does a very good job of taking us through Faraday's life with depth but also in a very readable way.  He brings out not only Faraday's scientific achievements but also his dedication to his strict form of Christianity (the Sandemanians) and the tension this sometime brought to his life.  He showed Faraday's constant struggle against illness and his own limitations. Also, he shows something of Faraday's artistic side and how this influenced Faraday's research, most obviously in his support of the developing science/art of photography.<br /><br />Though Hamilton's expertise in art gives an added dimension often missing from scientific biography, it also contributes to the two main weaknesses of this book.  In general, Hamilton's explanations of Faraday's work is quite good, particularly for the general reader, but he does miss some opportunities.  Most noticeably, he gives a very cursory coverage to Faraday's development of the field concept which plays such an important role in physics today.  This is quite surprising considering how easily it lends itself to artistic depiction.  Additionally, from his previous work it seems he has a fixation on the British landscape artist, J. Turner, and refers to him repeatedly throughout the book (particular in the latter part) whereas I could not see how this contributed in any real way to the story of Faraday.<br /><br />Despite this, Hamilton has written a very good book here that will hopefully contribute to a revival in interest in this very important scientific figure, particularly here in the U.S.  When I traveled to England some years ago I was surprised upon turning over a twenty pound note to see an image of Michael Faraday.  Clearly Faraday still retains respect in his homeland.

Overall the selection of the writings is very good.  They are of high quality and of varying points of view, particularly with reference to the last three sections of the book.<br /><br />For example, there is considerable difference of opinion to Anne's ability as a writer, some find her skills exceptional while others think her ability overrated despite her impact.  Better known are the arguments over whether the play and movie produced from Anne's diary truly reflected the \\"real\\" Anne.  Then there are the arguments, growing in recent years, as to whether Anne's diary is an \\"accurate\\" or \\"important\\" portrayal of the Jewish experience during the Holocaust.  I may not agree with Lawrence L. Langer's assessment that the diary is not a \\"vital text\\" of the Holocaust but seeing his point of view allows me to think a little deeper about my own position.  And therein lies the book's real strength.<br /><br />Ultimately, though the excerpts are brief and it's easy to plow through them rather quickly, this book can open one's eyes.  Some of the material I had read before in other places but I was very glad to encounter the wide points of view that the editors were able to gather.  The fact that Anne's single work still has the power to generate such scholarship 60 years later seems to point out its continuing importance in our experience.	2005-07-11

Fortunately, despite the fact that his intelligence cannot be ignored, he generally doesn't make his reader feel small and stupid.  In fact, when Eco is at his best, the fascinations of the story draw you in and make you forget the challenges of what you are reading.  When he is at his worst, the going gets tougher, like listening to a professor who is interesting but not really entertaining.  In The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana we get Eco at his best and worst.<br /><br />This novel is divided into three parts and the first part is as good as anything Eco's written since The Name of the Rose.  We are given the interesting premise of a man, Yambo, who has lost the memory of the events of his life while retaining the memory of the things he has learned--the books he has read, the music he has heard, etc.  Eco is able to believably evoke the experience of this man whose mind is like a textbook, full of facts but with no connection to the people who sees before him.  It is a fascinating point of view.  As the story progresses, he and his family and friends attempt to figure out ways to bring back his personal memories.  To that end, he is packed off alone to his childhood home in Solara.<br /><br />It is in part two, the stay in Solara, where the going gets tougher.  This section is basically a review of the music and literature of pre- and post-WWII Italy.  Not being Italian, I had very little connection to the bulk of the material described though it did evoke some memories of my own childhood literary experiences.  It is amazing how much literature really does become universal in Western culture.  Still, this section basically came across as Eco's own stroll down memory lane and I think, even for an Italian of similar vintage, it goes on rather long.<br /><br />In section three, Eco gets back on track with his story.  Yambo has had another \\"episode\\" but this time his personal memories are returning.  We hear Yambo's unconscious mind answer some of the questions about his life that have been raised, the bulk of which centers around a great story of the young Yambo helping some Partisans escape capture during the war.  I was less than thrilled by Eco's version of the \\"going into the light\\" death at the end of the book but he gained back a lot of my goodwill in this closing section.<br /><br />In the final analysis, this is a pretty good novel.  Eco's work will forever suffer in comparison to his truly great first novel, The Name of the Rose.  I have read all of his novels since then and this is without a doubt the best complete novel he's written since Foucault's Pendulum.  Some of the writing in section one may be the best he's ever done.  It is definitely worth reading.his time his personal memories are returning.

I grew up listening to musicians like Simon & Garfunkel, the Beatles, Bob Dylan and James Taylor; however, they all were basically superstars before I was born.  The Police were the first \\"contemporary\\" group to whom I listened, playing all five of their LPS until the grooves were worn, and I loyally followed Sting into his solo career.  I believe Sting remains one of the best modern songwriters and I continue to be a fan.<br /><br />I consider myself a passionate fan but my fandom is not rabid.  I focus mainly on the work and generally have little interest in a star's private life.  You can't help but pick up things in the midst of the media storm in which we live today but I do my best to keep my attitudes about a person's private life separate from my feelings about the work.  My rare exception to this is when someone writes an autobiography.  I rarely read biographies about living persons but I will often read an autobiography from someone whom I admire.  Keeping in mind that no one is willing to reveal everything about themselves, it is often interesting to see what a person chooses to reveal.  Such is the case with this book.<br /><br />I am in no position to judge the factual content of Sting's story.  On the other hand, I was surprised at how well Broken Music reflected what I would have expected from what appears to be Sting's personality.  For fans, the most obvious thing that stands out is Sting's continued conflicted feelings about his success with the Police.  Most obviously, this can be seen in the fact that this book covers Sting's life only up until the time of the formation of the Police.  He still seems unwilling to really confront the meaning and experience of those years publicly.  On the other hand, it is interesting in the final pages of the book to hear Sting tell of his first encounters with, in particular, Stewart Copeland and, later, Andy Summers.<br /><br />The other big thing that stood out for me is how this book reflected a man's obsession with music and unrepentant drive for success.  Granted, we do learn a lot about the simple facts of Sting's early life and relationships, his developing musical interest; however, underscoring it all is his need to do whatever it takes to win in the music world.  As we've seen in his music, we also have Sting trying to self-analyze in this book and come to grips with his relationships with his mother, father, and a couple of early girlfriends but this stands in stark contrast to the ambition that underlies everything.  It goes to show how even as writers try to present themselves in the best light, a certain amount of truth can't help but sneak through.<br /><br />As a writer, Sting is quite good, as one might expect.  Even if his experience centers mainly around 3 minute pop songs, he shows that he can write excellent extended prose as well.  I was worried at first because the prose in his recollection of the ayahuasca experience is a little flowery but he quickly settles down into serious story-telling.  Broken Music is certainly an appropriate title to this memoir as it is generally a linear story punctuated by the occasional flash forward and omniscient comment.  (Not to mention the title's origin: as I recall from the book, the boy Gordon would sometimes pound atonally on his grandmother's piano and she would ask him to \\"stop playing that broken music.\\")<br /><br />All in all, Sting has written a wonderful little book here.  Anyone remotely a fan of his or anyone simply interested in music history will find a lot worth reading here.  Still, I have to admit to a desire to see a sequel to this book someday, covering his years with the Police and his solo career.  As the years go by, facts get clouded by the darkening shroud of memory; however, as this book shows, apart from the facts there is a lot of truth to be mined.  I hope we see more of this from Sting.r />The other big thing that stood out for me is how this book reflected a man's obsession with music and unrepentant drive for success.

He is one of those ubiquitous actors who turns up in supporting roles all over the place.  In fact, he has made a name for himself as one of the great B movie actors.  His last book, the autobiographical If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor, was a fun romp through the strange world of TV and movie-making by someone who isn't a star.  So, when his new book came out, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />In this novel, Mr. Campbell imagines himself getting a meaty role in an A picture directed by Mike Nichols and starring Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger.  Much of the novel centers around Mr. Campbell trying to do an A-list job while not getting fired.  However, as a carrier of the \\"B movie virus,\\" Mr. Campbell infects his new picture and starts to drag down the sensibilities of his A-list cohorts. Along the way, he is able to poke a lot of fun at big Hollywood as well as himself.<br /><br />The problem with this book is that, as a novel, it simply doesn't pack the punch that his autobiography does.  This book is in many ways as funny and ridiculous as If Chins Could Kill but with the knowledge that it didn't really happen it doesn't have the sublime hilarity of the earlier book.	2005-06-27

The first generation works hard to survive and provide for the second generation.  The second generation (partially because of Old World discipline and likely a desire to help struggling parents) uses education and opportunity to become successful.  Finally, the third generation and beyond are fully \\"Americanized.\\"  I see a lot of similarities to the story of my own Irish ancestors.<br /><br />Still, the experience of the Chinese and other Asian Americans is unique in certain respects.  In particular, like African Americans, Asian Americans will always stand out in our society simply because of obvious differences in looks--Asians do not look like Europeans.  This makes Asian Americans easier to marginalize and persecute, particularly in times of economic depression and civil unrest.  And there certainly have been many instances of this, which Ms. Chang does well to describe from the Chinese Exclusion Act to the Red scare through the challenges of modern education and global economy.  In spite of this, however, many Chinese have managed to do well in America and Ms. Chang describes many instances of this as well, giving at least a touch of balance to her account.<br /><br />If there is a weakness in this book, it is that Ms. Chang has done her research too well and cannot help sharing the details of what she's learned.  Too often, we are buried under a flurry of names.  Though specific examples can add a good flavor to a book like this, too many specific examples are simply a challenge to the reader.  Ms. Chang would have been better off, I think, pulling back on some of her instincts to share all.<br /><br />In the end, however, this is a small complaint about a very good book.  As the husband of a Chinese immigrant, I was looking for some reading that would help me better understand my wife and her extended family.  This book fits the bill very well.  If nothing else, I discovered the meaning of some of the terms they toss around (ABC = American-born Chinese), some of the challenges still faced by the Chinese in America and some of the resources available for \\"Hapa\\" (mixed-race people of some Asian ancestry) which my children will be.

In 1905, Albert Einstein published five scientific papers, all of which were important and three of which are still considered groundbreaking.  Many scientists would consider themselves lucky to publish five important papers in a lifetime, which is one of the many reasons why Einstein's achievement is considered such a triumph.  And yet, it is rare, even among the well-educated, to find people who really know what Einstein did.  Words like \\"relativity\\" and \\"E = mc squared\\" are tossed around without any real comprehension of their meaning.  That is why it is good and not at all surprising to find a book like Mr. Rigden's on the shelf now.<br /><br />In Einstein 1905, Mr. Rigden takes us through each of Einstein's papers of 1905--the quantum paper of March (often referred to as the \\"photoelectric effect\\" paper), the molecular dimensions paper of April, the \\"Brownian motion\\" paper of May, the relativity paper of June and the energy-mass paper (with that famous equation) in September.  He does his best to explain exactly what it is that each paper said and, simultaneously, what Einstein was trying to achieve.  (Not always the same thing.)  He is even better at explaining the impact each paper had on the development of physics often far into the future and in ways Einstein both did and did not see.  He also describes how many people still misunderstand what the impact of these papers is.<br /><br />This is by no means a book for the faint of heart.  Mr. Rigden throws physics terminology around a little to easily for that.  However, it is also not a book that requires a serious education in math and physics.  It is very readable with hardly an equation in sight.  A reader with a good general education and a desire to understand the impact that Einstein had on the world will get a lot from this book because, in the final analysis, the physics is only the means to an end here.<br /><br />Ultimately, Mr. Rigden is trying to get a handle on the nature of genius in his analysis of some of Einstein's greatest triumphs.  Apart from Newton's flurry of brilliance in the early 1660's, there is probably not another period of time in history where so much has been achieved over such a brief period.  Einstein's name has become synonymous with genius and everyone would like to know what it was that made Einstein who he was.<br /><br />Still, in the end, the nature of genius remains elusive.  Mr. Rigden has written a great history here but is basically remains on the surface as it must in an investigation like this.  One can describe how Einstein was confidently stubborn and how he worked from contradictions to \\"generalize it and then be guided by its implications until a resolution was found, frequently in the form of profound new insights.\\"  True as this may be (and I found his recurring discussion of the continuity/discontinuity problem in physics to be one of the most insightful things I've read recently), this doesn't always lead to genius--as can be seen from Einstein's own later years.<br /><br />The fact remains that Einstein's work was an achievement almost without equal and that Mr. Rigden has written an excellent account of it.  Einstein's work should be better understood beyond being able to mouth a single equation and the term \\"relativity.\\"  Here, in a slim volume, we have a respect for the totality of Einstein's triumphs of 1905 and should be read by anyone who claims to be educated.imately, Mr. Rigden is trying to get a handle on the nature of genius in his analysis of some of Einstein's greatest triumphs.

For the scientist, it is the fact that the book in question is one of the most important books in scientific history, De revolutionibus by Nicholas Copernicus, where he proposes the heliocentric (sun-centered) theory of the solar system.<br /><br />Mr. Gingerich, a respected historian of science, became interested in this book by Copernicus when he read a claim by another historian, Arthur Koestler, that De revolutionibus was read by no one when it was first published, implying that its impact on the history of science was over-rated.  So Mr. Gingerich goes on a decades-long search to track down every first and second edition copy of the book still in existence.  By his own estimate, that requires a look at better than a thousand copies which reside in libraries both public and private all around the world.<br /><br />At first glance, this might not seem like a very interesting topic for a book but the quest is merely the thread that holds together a very interesting story, out of which many things develop.  We see a man go from a novice to a very sophisticated book expert.  We see the insides of interesting libraries all over the world.  And, most tellingly, we see how the examination of these old volumes lead to insight after insight into the development of science in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<br /><br />Of course, we are told the story of the publication of this very important book with looks at the author, his students & friends and his publisher.  But we also see how the annotations of marginalia of the various volumes can indicate a lot about how the book influenced the scientists that followed.  Notes in books by well-known scientists like Brahe, Kepler, Galileo and Newton (among many other less-known scientists) show the actual scope of Copernicus' influence despite Koestler's claim.  (There are so many fascinating anecdotes in this book but one I particularly enjoy is about Galileo's copy which shows the book altered with appropriate corrections issued by the Inquisition but done in such a way that the original text could still be read easily.)<br /><br />Yet, even though this book is incredibly enlightening about the development of science in its early centuries, it is made readable by the fact that it always remains a personal quest.  Mr. Gingerich himself becomes fascinating to his readers as he describes everything he goes through to see certain copies and come to his conclusions, sometimes making mistakes, revising and covering old ground, but always keeping to his quest.  In fact, I have to admit to a little jealousy of Mr. Gingerich.  After hearing him describe his tale, I wish I could have experienced it all myself.<br /><br />I don't know how I missed this book when it first came out.  I remember seeing it but somehow passed over it at the time.  That was a serious misjudgement.  This is a fantastic book and one of the best I've read on the history of science in this period.but one I particularly enjoy is about Galileo's copy which shows the book altered with appropriate corrections issued by the Inquisition but done in such a way that the original text could still be read easily.) <br /> <br />Yet, even though this book is incredibly enlightening about the development of science in its early centuries, it is made readable by the fact that it always remains a personal quest.

I didn't really expect much from it.  Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.  This is an excellent book.<br /><br />This book reminded me of Jostein Gaarder's book, Sophie's World, in that it is an education framed within a story.  In Gaarder's case we are taken through the history of philosophy in the story of a young girl.  Delaney takes us through the history of Ireland in the story of a young boy.  Unlike Gaarder, however, Delaney puts much more effort into his framing story and his lessons of history are much more engaging than Gaarder's lessons of philosophy.  Gaarder's book feels like an education.  Delaney's feels like a novel.<br /><br />The framing story in this book is of a young boy, Ronan O'Mara, who hears a nameless Storyteller tell tales of Ireland's past when he is nine years old.  His is fascinated by the Storyteller but his mother doesn't approve and sends the man packing.  In rebellion, Ronan spends most of his young life tracking the Storyteller, first by post and then, when he is old enough, on foot.  Along the way, Ronan himself becomes a master historian and, more interestingly, learns his own history.<br /><br />But much of the power of this novel lies in the stories of Ireland's history that make up the bulk of the novel.  We get stories from the age of myth through the Easter Rising of 1916.  Admittedly, my favorites were the early stories (the Architect of Newgrange, King Conor of Ulster, St. Patrick--I read the first couple hundred pages in one sitting) though I also found the last story of the Easter Rising very well done.  In fact, whenever Delaney speaks through the voice of the Storyteller, I found the stories themselves better and more interesting.  It can be a trick to make history interesting to read and with this device as history as stories, Delaney does well.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent novel.  It is filled with great characters, some with an historical basis and many not.  Plus, I found the novel filled with surprises.  Some in the history of Ireland I didn't know and some in the final revelations about the O'Mara's.  I am not easily surprised by novels and so I can appreciate one that does as good a job as this one.<br /><br />Obviously, anyone who has an interest in Irish history would be a fool to miss this book; however, it is a good novel in its own right.  I believe anyone who enjoys a good novel will find this one a good read.racters, some with an historical basis and many not.  Plus, I found the novel filled with surprises.

One Woman. 10,000 Years of Misunderstanding Between the Sexes Cleared Right Up	Books	5	10	11	N	Y	I Laughed Out Loud, What More Can One Ask?	What remains to be said in the battle of the sexes?  Quite a lot, it seems.  In fact, it's likely a subject that will never cease to fascinate.  What's often missing in the discussion, however, is humor.  Humor is something Gene & Gina have in spades.<br /><br />In this extended conversation between two clever comedians, Gene & Gina cover a lot of old ground and some new but their banter is always fun and fresh.  They also have very distinct personalities: Gene as the old newspaper hack and Gina as the slumming academic.  I also find their occasional guests highly entertaining as well as their silences (In the chapter on jokes that offend women, GINA: Why don't you tell the one you told me about the three tampons walking down the street? GENE:  GINA: Go ahead.  The whole class is waiting. GENE:  )<br /><br />Overall, there's something slightly offensive, deeply truthful and very funny about this book.  I found myself laughing out loud more than a few times.  That's all I really ask for in a book I pick up for fun.	2005-06-05

That being said, if you accept the premise of this novel, then I think it is a very good one.<br /><br />Of course, anyone familiar with the Anne Frank story will know the premise is based on an inaccuracy: that Peter van Pels survived the war and made his way to America.  It is well established that Peter van Pels died in Mauthausen concentration camp in May 1945.  So that puts this novel firmly in the genre of alternate history.  But if you can allow yourself the suspension of disbelief over this one point The Boy Who Loved Anne Frank is an interesting one.<br /><br />What made the novel enjoyable for me after leaping that first big hurdle is that the \\"Peter\\" Ms. Feldman gives us is a realistic one.  I found him to be a convincing character.  His struggles with denial and anger, atheism and Judaism, episodes of madness, as well as his desire to just live a normal life in the wake of his experiences all came across as very authentic.  And, of course, Peter's story is heightened by the growing fame of Anne Frank and her story from the 1950's on.  His reactions to Anne's diary and its subsequent dramatizations for stage and screen seem real.<br /><br />This leads me to what I think is the other brilliant part of this novel: it accurately tells the story of the rise of the Anne Frank story in American and world consciousness through the publication of the diary and then the production of the stage play and movie.  Peter never interacts directly with the results of Anne's developing fame (despite a few attempts) so he becomes a great observer of the actual historical unfolding, including some of the lesser known events like Meyer Levin's lawsuit against Otto Frank and the debate over inaccuracies in the diary.<br /><br />Most importantly, however, it is simply a good read.  The story is a fascinating one and is handled well.  It is interesting for those of us who are very familiar with Anne's diary and will open the eyes of those who may only have peripheral knowledge of Anne's story.  It is well worth reading.imply a good read.  The story is a fascinating one and is handled well.

For 26 chapters Mr. Fields writes well and then loses it in the last chapter.<br /><br />In Players, Mr. Fields investigates the identity of William Shakespeare.  While doing so, Mr. Fields divides the world into Stratfordians (those who believe the man from Stratford actually wrote the plays) and \\"anti-Strats\\" (those who believe someone else actually wrote the plays).  In my experience most serious scholars--and I do not consider myself anything more than an amateur Shakespearean scholar myself--don't really question that the man from Stratford wrote the plays and, despite my lowly status, I place myself firmly in the Stratford man's camp.  On the other hand, many amateur Shakespeareans--Mr. Fields is, after all, a novelist and entertainment lawyer--love the conspiracy theory and the search for an alternate identity for Shakespeare.<br /><br />All that being said, Mr. Fields has written a wonderfully fascinating and readable account.  His experience in the law serves him well as he sifts through the available evidence and fairly tries to give points where points are due to both the strats and anti-strats.  There are some inaccuracies but he does a reasonable job.  In the last part of the book he weighs the evidence for some of the most popular \\"real Shakespeares\\" from the obvious (Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford) to the ridiculous (Queen Elizabeth).  For the most part, I felt he presented the evidence reasonably well; mainly because he stood back and let the evidence speak for itself without making too many judgements.<br /><br />In the last chapter, however, he makes a case for the plays being written cooperatively between Oxford and Shakespeare with Oxford supplying the bulk and the rustic Shakespeare providing those parts that would please the groundlings.  When Oxford dies in 1603, he has left behind a number of mostly finished plays that his son-in-law, Stanley, reworks with Shakespeare and gradually releases.  Along the way, help and advice is gotten from people ranging from Marloe & Jonson to Francis Bacon.  Whew!  At one point, Fields asks how Shakespeare can be the author of these plays since so little written evidence points to him.  I would ask Fields how such a magnificent conspiracy between so many important people could be perpetrated without a single piece of written evidence (a letter, someone's journal) pointing to it.<br /><br />I have to admit, this last chapter threw me for a loop and colored my enjoyment of the rest of the book.  Like most \\"unmasked conspiracies\\" it is fun to read and exciting in its intrigue but the fact is (and at least Fields admits this) it is likely we will never know for sure.  However, I am of the type that believes the burden of proof lies on the anti-strats (to borrow another phrase from Mr. Fields).  Works of genius are, by definition, created by a genius.  A genius is someone who reaches far beyond what is expected or typical of the time.  Say whatever you want about how Shakespeare's upbringing and experience could never have prepared him to write these wonderful plays.  Barring incontrovertible evidence, I find it easier to believe that the Stratford man somehow had the ability to rise above his experience and create these works than that a conspiratorial group effort managed the same.<br /><br />But read the book and decide for yourself.

US	50946478	R3FA4AP6R0GKSC	0789312042	314117093	Soft	Books	3	16	21	N	Y	Misleading Title	After reading the interview with Mr. Kern at the beginning of this book, I felt like I was able to get some sense of the man.  I understand a little bit about his history and development as an artist.  But, in point of fact, this is the first time I've seen Kern's work.  And, though I think I understand why he calls this collection Soft, I don't think that word accurately describes most of this work.  Gritty, I would think is more accurate.  Harsh.<br /><br />That is not to say that there aren't some images he that I really enjoyed.  \\"Sarah's purple top,\\" \\"Vicci's skirt,\\" \\"Kaori in bed,\\" \\"Laura's backside in shower,\\" and \\"Morning coffee\\" I all felt hit just the right note: the stark, unfilteredness that Kern captures in most of his images combined with that sense of softness you expect from the title.  There is no doubt Mr. Kern has talent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, most of these images did not effect me in a positive way.  I'm not against art that makes the viewer feel uncomfortable or dirty but, when I do get that reaction, I also like to feel that I've come through the experience having gained something.  Insight, at least.  With many of these pictures, I didn't see their meaning and I didn't see their beauty and I was left feeling empty.  If that was Mr. Kern's purpose, then he succeeded.  But that's not what I want from photography.	2005-05-21

And the joys of these little volumes are legion, from the introductions by various writers (this time Matt Groening of Simpsons fame) to the comic strips themselves.  Overall, this volume, covering 1955-1956, is another triumph.<br /><br />The only reason I wanted to make a particular comment about this volume is that, for the first time, I read strips that I knew.  Granted, I wouldn't even be born for more than a decade so I never saw these strips in their first run but this is part and parcel of the Peanuts story.  When I was a kid and I visited my grandmother's house, she had paperbacks containing old Peanuts strips.  I don't even remember the titles, but I remember the strips: they all starred Snoopy and they showed him impersonating other animals (like the python) and other characters (like Lucy).  All these strips are in this volume.<br /><br />In the previous two volumes my key joy had been seeing the beginning and reading strips I had never seen before.  In this volume there was still some of that but my overriding feeling was that of visiting my grandmother's house when I was a kid.  It is a nice feeling.	2005-05-21

Within this ranges of approaches some have written more readable accounts than others.  In The Great Mortality, Mr. Kelly definitely leans more towards the social approach and, as a writer, he is. . .not bad.<br /><br />The title itself indicates Mr. Kelly's desire to give us a feel of the times.  Terming this plague \\"the Black Death\\" is actually quite a modern designation.  Writers in the day more accurately called the event \\"the Great Mortality.\\"<br /><br />In terms of the focus of the book, Mr. Kelly traces the progress of the mortality from the steppes of Asia through Italy, Spain, France, England and spaces far flung and in between.  Always, he tries to track its logical progress and, always, he tries to give us a sense of its impact on the people by quoting from writings and statistics of the time.  Much of this primary source material is fascinating though it is sometimes feast or famine.  England, for example, seems to get more attention simply because it is from there that we have more records of the time.  Still, there is a lot of good stuff here about a lot of places and events.<br /><br />The problem with this book is that, overall, it gives the impression of a certain vagueness.  There is an expected amount of uncertainty dealing with an historical event so many centuries ago; however, as a reader, I like to get the sense that the author I'm reading has a certain confidence in his assertions and his sources.  Mr. Kelly's anecdotes get quite circular as he recounts tale after tale of death and the medieval writer's tendency toward hyperbole can make things difficult but he rarely draws conclusions and is sometimes unclear when he does.  He often quotes things like death rates for different regions but always in ranges and rarely spells out why he decides to settle on a certain figure.  He notes the extraordinarily high death rate for clergy in England and implies that this is because of their care for the people but then hints that they might not really have been doing there jobs so well after all.  This kind of writing can get a bit unsettling.<br /><br />However, these are quibbles in what is basically a well written account.  As a math & science teacher, my tastes tend more towards the scientific accounts of the plague but I found this book quite enjoyable.  I wouldn't say Mr. Kelly manages to take us back to the fourteenth century but he gives us a taste of it and definitely gives us a logical and informative look back.

I've read nearly all of them and I've never been disappointed, even as I head into the second half of my fourth decade.  Any book that's good enough for your children should be good enough for you too.<br /><br />That being said, this is not one of my favorites among the Newbery's.  Kadohata is excellent at convincingly telling this story from the point of view of a young child and this story of Japanese-Americans struggling to get by in the deep South with a very ill child is a good one; however, I felt very much like I knew where this story was going and I occasionally felt my emotions were being manipulated by the author.  I wept the required tears but I didn't feel satisfied.<br /><br />Still, I'm fond of the occasional tear-jerker and, if you are too, then this book is a good place to go.	2005-05-09

In Heirs of the Fisherman, John-Peter Pham tries to answer that question.  In that, he succeeds quite admirably.  In particular, in chapters 3 and 5, Mr. Pham describes quite well the process of conclave and the subsequent installation of the new pope.<br /><br />But Mr. Pham's book is more than a description of conclave.  It is, in fact, a brief papal history.  The bulk of this book is taken up by the past: how popes have died, how they were buried, how they were elected before the evolution of the conclave, how schisms developed and were healed (if they healed).  We get tidbits, it seems, on just about every pope ever to sit on the throne of St. Peter.  In fact, the entirety of chapter four is a detailed history of the conclaves of the twentieth century, outlining the votes and politicking that elected St. Pius X through John Paul II.<br /><br />Still, it is fascinating stuff.  I felt I learned a lot, particularly since I took the time to read the endnotes (which I suggest bear reading).  And being written only a little over a year ago, it is more up to date that some of the other books on papal succession.  The section on the issues facing the next conclave, in particular, I felt was very current.<br /><br />This is not a perfect book.  Only about half the book is text, with the rest being taken by appendices of varying interest.  Mr. Pham's prose is sometimes difficult to follow, particularly in the early, more historical chapters, when he gets bogged down in names and events with which some readers might not be familiar.  And, of course, it will become dated after the conclave of 2005 is finished.  Still, it will remain a great snapshot of this moment in the Church, to be looked back upon with interest when the prognostication is over and the reality of the new pope sets in.	2005-04-18

Having become familiar with Mr. Black through his segments on The Daily Show with John Stewart, I thought this book would be a collection of rants on current events much like he does on the show.  I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />Basically, this book is a memoir of Mr. Black's formative years: growing up outside of Washington DC, attending UNC in the fabulous sixties and heading out for a few years to Colorado to run a theater after a brief stint working for the government.  It is in the immediate aftermath of his Colorado experience that the book winds down.  Apart from a few brief forays into political commentary in asides, what you've got is a person telling there life story.<br /><br />That said, Mr. Black is a funny man and he tells his story with humor.  I wouldn't say this is the best thing I've ever read but I did find myself laughing out loud a few times.  To me, for that alone, the book is worth reading.  Still, be aware of what you're getting when you get this book.	2005-04-18

Many people will likely be looking for resources to give them some clue as to what happens next.  In particular, how is the next pope chosen?  Many people may be familiar with the term \\"conclave\\" but many not be certain as to what it all really entails.  This book spells it out quite well.<br /><br />A thin volume, of particular interest is chapter 3, \\"How the Conclave Works\\".  Mr. Allen, a longtime reporter on Catholic issues, does an excellent job of taking us through the steps from the moment of John Paul's death through the process of the election of his successor.  However, this book actually does much more as one might expect from someone conversant with the working of the Vatican.  There are chapters detailing the duties of the popes, the issues facing the electors and some of the factions within the college of cardinals.  He also has some interesting points to make about how the intense media scrutiny of this election will effect things for the better and for the worse.<br /><br />The weakness of the book, of course, is that it is somewhat dated.  Written three years ago now, the chapter on \\"the candidates\\" could use an update.  Also, the child abuse scandal that has rocked the Church in the past couple years needs to be addressed.  However, it is somewhat surprising how few of the names have changed: some have aged beyond eligibility, some have passed and some have changed jobs, but a surprising number have remained basically unchanged.  The Church is nothing if not slow to change.<br /><br />In this time of change, it is nice to know that there is someplace to go for answers to the basic questions.  Mr. Allen has provided some of the answers for us and I recommend this book as a useful tool to understanding the days ahead.	2005-04-03

If, on the other hand, his purpose was to take us through the historical scientific development that led to the big bang theory being the most prominent cosmological theory of the day, then he succeeds admirably.<br /><br />This is a book that begins at the beginning: with stories of myth and legend about the creation of the world.  Then he quickly moves to the ancient Greeks; that is, Aristotle and Ptolemy.  After that, we go through many of the big names in classical science: Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, etc..  In short order we reach Einstein, Hubble and many of the other important contributors to modern physics and cosmology.  Along the way, we pick up much of the basic physics that is going to lead inexorably to big bang theory.<br /><br />There is much about this book that I like a lot.  Dr. Singh is very knowledgeable and leaves out very little of importance as he teaches us how big bang theory came to be.  I especially liked his focus on the experimental and observational discoveries that were crucial to the development of the theory.  Too often the experimentalists get short shrift in these histories.  He is also particularly good about explaining why new theories can only incrementally supersede old theories as they answer more questions and explain new observations.  His \\"theory checklists\\" (see p. 34-35 for an example) are clever at showing why many people held onto the old theories (geocentrism, etc.) and why they were eventually overturned.<br /><br />This is not a perfect book.  Dr. Singh does have a tendency to digress and his prose is not always the most absorbing; however, he has written a book that is very accessible.  Any reasonably educated reader should have no trouble following along.  Of course, anyone looking for an up-to-the-minute elucidation of big bang theory should look elsewhere.  But if you a looking for a detailed examination of the foundation of big bang theory, you have come to the right place.  This is a history, not a article of the moment.

Mr. White's ability to see the logical flaws in an argument is impressive and there are few things that would benefit this world more than if more people had the ability to see if they were being misled by their politicians, pundits and religious leaders.  A serious reader of this book would certainly gain more tools in this difficult task.<br /><br />On the other hand, in my opinion this book does have one weakness: its dismissive tone.  There is a subtle air of superiority that Mr. White projects in his prose that I find disheartening.  Though he pays lip service to the fact that it can be very difficult to spot certain logical fallacies, particularly as we are bombarded by opinions disguised as fact 24 hours a day through the media, he does not seem very sympathetic the fact that many people do try their best to work there way through the morass of opinions despite being hampered by media overkill, prominent positions demanding action, their own strongly held opinions and the lack of a prestigious education.  Mr. White has much to teach but it is difficult to swallow when the student is made to feel small and foolish.<br /><br />I am particularly disappointed by Mr. White's dismissiveness towards religion.  Though I agree completely with his assertion that religious tenets (like the existence of God, etc.) cannot be proved logically and that many religious leaders misuse logic severely, I do not agree that this is sufficient to dismiss religious experience out of hand.  Granted, I am a person of religious belief, but I am also a mathematician and I would argue that there are things that are true that cannot be proved.  But I'm sure Mr. White, chuckling sadly and looking down his nose at me, would disagree.<br /><br />Still, this does not change my opinion that this is a very powerful book that should be widely read.  Much of his analysis--begging the question, coincidence, statistical analysis--I have seen expounded upon more widely in other books but Mr. White's book is concise and ranges much more widely.  Anyone trying to get a handle on our world today would benefit from reading it.n expounded upon more widely in other books but Mr. White's book is concise and ranges much more widely.

Instead, there are a number of photos from Germany of the 1920's through the end of the second world war.  There is also a considerable amount of text, again concentrating mostly on the history of the period instead of Anne's history.  If you are not already familiar with Anne's story, you won't learn much of it here.<br /><br />And therein lies the crux of the problem for me: though there is some interesting text and fascinating photos in this book, if you don't already know Anne's story and the story of the period, it is difficult to learn much from this.  Different facets of Nazism and the Frank story are told in a couple paragraphs per page when some of these topics covered in a page have had entire volumes of history written about them.  I fear that a young reader would have difficulty understanding things and could be misled if this book is the only source of information.<br /><br />On the other hand, for someone already familiar with the period, this book can make a very good supplement.  I just would not let this book be the first one about the Franks I put in my child's hands.	2005-02-25

Mr. Murrian demonstrates that he has considerable talent and I'm glad to have this book in my collection; however, I would not say that I consider Murrian in the first rank of portrait photographers. . .yet.<br /><br />The main thing I don't like in this book is the overabundance of soft focus images.  A few are wonderful but one after the other ruins the effect.  Most of my favorite photos do not have any obvious work done on them.  It is almost too self-consciously \\"artistic\\" in style:  Mr. Murrian seems to work very hard to capture his model and I prefer work that seems more relaxed and accessible.<br /><br />On the other hand, Murrian is mainly successful at what he attempts to do, \\"to reveal both the innocence and the sensuality of girls who are in the process of becoming,\\" as he says in his introduction to the book.  With time and experience, Mr. Murrian may reach the level of a Jock Sturges or Mary Ellen Mark.  I look forward to seeing where Mr. Murrian goes with his talent.	2005-02-25

I couldn't wait to read the entire book.  It turned out to be everything I hoped it would be.<br /><br />On one level, it is a real-life mystery story.  A group of divers find a wreck in the waters off New Jersey that no one has ever seen before.  It turns out to be a German U-boat.  No German U-boat is recorded as having been sunk anywhere near the site of the wreck.  Over the course of a number of years clues are uncovered, research is done, wrong paths are followed and truth is unraveled until, finally, proof is brought up from the bottom of the Atlantic.  It is a fascinating tale.<br /><br />On another level, it is a story of diving and, more importantly, the men who do the diving.  Some of the fascination in a book like this, at least for me, is the ability to glimpse a world I will never know.  Part of me longs to walk Antarctica like Scott & Amundsen or dive for sunken ships like the men in this book, but I know I will never do it.  For me, what must surely be the extraordinary highs of deep-sea diving will never compensate for the risk involved.  And yet, it is thrilling at least to live the life vicariously through a story like this.<br /><br />We learn the difficulties and, sometimes, horrors of diving to depths of 200 feet or more.  It doesn't seem like much but only a handful of divers have the ability to go this far under the ocean. Bill Nagle,  John Chatterton and Richie Kohler are men who have this skill.  We learn about their lives, the close-knit and often alien culture of divers and what drives them to risk their lives (and, in a some cases as we see up close in this book, lose their lives).  We see the search to name this U-boat become an obsession for Chatterton and Kohler and share with them the excitement of their search and ultimate success.<br /><br />Kurson does an excellent job of telling the story.  His prose allows us to participate in the journey, scared, amazed, sickened and elated as the moment warrants.  He lets the clues unfold and doesn't give away the answer until the time is right.  It is a wonderful book well worth reading.journey, scared, amazed, sickened and elated as the moment warrants.  He lets the clues unfold and doesn't give away the answer until the time is right.

Countless numbers.  How many people played a minor role whose story is there to be told if only someone is willing to tell it?  Many.  States Dyckman is one of these and Mr. Flexner has decided to tell his story.<br /><br />States was a branch of a family who left their stamp on New York City and its surroundings.  Dyckman Street cuts across the northern tip of Manhattan near the Dyckman House that still sits at the corner of 204th Street & Broadway.  Unlike the bulk of his family, however, States threw his lot in with the British, becoming part of the staff of the Quartermaster.  During the course of the Revolutionary War, States and many of his superiors gained a great fortune through the winked at graft of the quartermasters.  His unstinting loyalty to his superiors made and lost States two fortunes but, after a couple long stretches in England, he ultimately found his way back to his home and family in the newly forming United States.  His final monument to his life is the mansion he built, Boscobel, that now sits on a bluff above the Hudson River across from West Point.<br /><br />Because States' story centers around finances, it is not as exciting as the life of a Revolutionary War hero.  However, it is a story that has its fascinations.  We get a reminder that not all our forbearers were as supportive of the Revolution as we like to think.  We get a glimpse inside an extended family trying to make its way in these difficult times.  We get a deeper look into what makes an army work besides battles.  It is a worthwhile endeavor and Mr. Flexner does a good job of telling it.<br /><br />Admittedly, this is not a book that would normally leap off the shelf at me; however, I live three blocks from the Dyckman House in Manhattan and I attend performances of the Hudson Valley Shakespeare festival which happens to be on the grounds of Boscobel.  When I toured the mansion and discovered that the builder of that house was also a Dyckman, I had to find out something about this family.  This book answered some of my curiosity.  Hopefully, it will answer some of yours as well.uilder of that house was also a Dyckman, I had to find out something about this family.  This book answered some of my curiosity.

Still, I have to say that, though there are interesting moments in this \\"story,\\" for the most part I was unimpressed.  The writing to me was self-indulgent and childish, typical of a teenage girl's diary but not the ones that usually receive world-wide publication.  Is this really the way a teenager thinks and speaks in the twenty-first century?  If so, then they don't think and speak too differently from the writers of erotic novels in Victorian times.<br /><br />From the reviews and interviews I've read, some of the popularity of this novel is explained by the fact that it is based on the author's own experiences.  Considering that, it does offer the story a little more poignancy.  But what is this book supposed to do for the reader, then?  Are we supposed to be aroused by the eroticism or saddened by the poor protagonist's violations?  In the end, various passages made me feel a little of both.  But the key word there is \\"little.\\"  I was not extraordinarily moved in either direction and I didn't feel like I was left with any universal insights into the experiences of a modern teenager.<br /><br />It actually bothers me that I was disappointed by this book.  I was probably expecting a little too much from the hype in the articles I'd read.  And I really dislike doing anything that might discourage a young person from picking up a pen and exploring their feelings in writing.  It is true that journals and diaries can often provide inspiration for wonderful works of fiction and nonfiction.  Rarely, however, is the journal itself a brilliant work.  This one, I think, is not.	2005-01-17

Over the years I have read many books about her and I continue to reread the diary every year.  Recently, this book came to my attention and I gave it a read.  There is much about it that impresses.<br /><br />This book is subtitled An Illustrated Journey Through Anne's World and that seems appropriate.  The key attraction of the book are the hundreds of photos that fill its pages, many of which I had never seen before.  With its oversize, coffee table book format, and slick pages, it is a beautiful thing to look at.  Where the book begins to let the reader down is the text.<br /><br />Granted, the text is minimal and what there is can be highly informative and descriptive; however, I noticed a number of typos in my edition and many of the pictures were mislabeled (if the label could be found at all).  It also seemed like different people were in charge of different sections of the book because there was no consistency to the presentation.  I actually liked the structure of the first section of the book, where German history ran in small pictures along the bottom of the pages and the Frank family filled the top.  I wish this style would have continued because it was very informative and allowed the reader to make connections but this was dropped rather quickly.<br /><br />Still, there is a lot to be said for this book.  It's cliche that a picture says a thousand words but it is amazing the emotion that is captured in some of these shots, particularly if you know the story behind them.	2005-01-08

I knew nothing about him or his exploits as an antarctic traveler.  Now, having read this book, I feel that Fiennes is a man I would like to know.  I do know that I like his book very much.<br /><br />What are the things I like about Fiennes?  First and foremost, he has written a well-researched, fascinating account of Robert Scott's two expeditions to Antarctica, focusing on the final trip of 1911-12 where Scott reached the South Pole a few weeks after the Norwegian Roald Amundsen and perished on his return journey.  Whatever else one wants to say about this book, it lives on Fiennes very engaging prose.  For that alone, he has my respect.  But there's more.<br /><br />I am not the kind of man who likes reading books where the main purpose is to tear down historical figures.  There is a tendency these days to make sure we have no more heroes in history but this is a trend I deplore.  Fiennes makes it very clear that he feels the same.  Scott's reputation has been damaged by biographies in recent decades and Fiennes wants to set the record straight.  He doesn't do so by making Scott an angel and Shackleton & Amundsen devils, but by presenting Scott as a man who faced challenges most of us cannot even imagine and did the best he could which, usually, was pretty good.<br /><br />Which leads to another important point: unlike any previous biographer of the recent past, Fiennes knows whereof he speaks.  I cannot stand cold weather and dread the approach of the New York winters I have to live through.  Fiennes has manually pulled a sled across Antarctica much like Scott did.  Fiennes has experienced many of Scott's challenges and understands what it takes to succeed and survive.  In my mind, this makes Fiennes' analysis much more valuable than the typical biographer.  I trust his judgement.<br /><br />Before reading this book, Scott, Shackleton and Amundsen were names to me.  I knew trivia about them.  Now I feel like I know something about who these men were and what was good and bad about what each of them accomplished.  They may not be on pedestals but they are heroes.  Few of us will likely ever travel to the South Pole but, for a moment, I had the urge to push myself to the limit like Scott and experience what few ever will.  I will likely never make it to the Antarctic but the taste of it I gained from this book will stay with me for a long time.Now I feel like I know something about who these men were and what was good and bad about what each of them accomplished.

I still have books of complicated mazes that I solved with notes on how long it took me to solve them.  Mazes are great fun.  And they are interesting too.  Which is what first attracted me to this book, subtitled A Journey Through Labyrinths and Mazes.  But I was hesitant about reading this for one main reason: what was there about mazes and labyrinths to talk about for over 200 pages?  Not enough, it turns out.<br /><br />The book starts out well enough.  Mr. McCullough takes us through some interesting points: the difference between a labyrinth and a maze, the variations of the Cretan labyrinth myth, the labyrinth as a meditative tool (for example, the Chartres labyrinth), the rise of the labyrinth as a garden sculpture, and much more.  The problem is, there just isn't enough known about this subject to make a book this long.<br /><br />Mr. McCullough would have been better off condensing this text to 150 pages or less.  He ends up repeating himself quite a bit as the book goes on and the \\"new age\\" applications of the labyrinth that is discussed at the end of the book I found mostly uninteresting.  Also, his discussion of the appearance of the labyrinth figure across ancient cultures is handled quite poorly and never gets developed as it should.<br /><br />The labyrinth, by its very nature, is mysterious and books should be written about this subject.  Mr. McCullough has made a valiant attempt that has its pluses but it repetitiveness and superficiality weaken it.  I'm still waiting for something more in-depth, revealing...better.	2004-12-31

At first the main thing to notice is that it is smaller in size and shorter on complete images.  But it seems that Sturges is trying to create a more intimate feel in this book and, in that, he succeeds.  Because his purpose in this book is more than presenting his photographs.<br /><br />The title of this book is Notes for a reason.  In it, we find considerably more text than we usually do in a Sturges book and it is not confined to forewords and afterwards.  There are, in fact, \\"notes\\" interspersed throughout the photographs.  Many of the notes are by Sturges himself though there are a number by his models.  The point of these (as well as a number of Polaroid photos) is to give us some insight into how Sturges works, how he develops his concepts and final images.  And they do do that to some extent though, if the truth be told, the workings of composing a beautiful portrait remains a mystery.  Still, it's an interesting attempt.<br /><br />On the other hand, I found the notes by the models quite interesting.  Many of the models have worked with Sturges for over 20 years and have grown up with him as part of their lives.  The word \\"family\\" is used a number of times.  This may or may not be true but it is intriguing to hear the different voices of the models in their prose.  When they talk about the photos in which they appear, it often gives the impression of those photos speaking in a new voice.  It gives these portraits a different flavor.<br /><br />But I am ignoring the fact that this book is also, if not mainly, a book of photography.  To be honest, I would have bought this book for the photo on the cover alone.  Fortunately, there is more of Sturges' wonderful portrait work on the inside.  His themes and the beauty of his work continue to interest me.  I have been a fan of Sturges' work for nearly 20 years now and this book is a wonderful digression, especially for fans.  I wouldn't send a newcomer to this book first, but it certainly has its place in Sturges' body of work.'t send a newcomer to this book first, but it certainly has its place in Sturges' body of work.	2004-12-19

As a reader with a science background (albeit in physics) I am always ready to read a new science book.  I also have an interest in the study of disease, particularly as it relates to the historical development of the human race.  Still, this book was a disappointment.<br /><br />Consider the following passage from the chapter on anthrax: \\"Most naturally occurring anthrax strains are sensitive to penicillin, which historically has been the preferred anthrax therapy.  Doxycycline is the preferred option among the tetracycline class of agents, because it has been proved efficacious in monkey studies.  Other members of this class of antibiotics are suitable, and animal studies suggest that such prophylaxis should be effective.  The floroquinolone antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin [Cipro®])should have equivalent efficacy, but no data are available...\\"  Not only is this dull prose, it is unimportant to the thread of the story that Dr. Bollett claims he is telling.  And this is only one of the most prominent examples of poor prose (besides making me wonder whether or not Dr. Bollett has any financial interest in Cipro).<br /><br />According to the introduction, this book is a revised edition to an earlier book on the same subject.  I didn't read the first edition but I have a feeling it is much better than this book.  Mainly because the last three chapters on emerging diseases are the poorest in the book and are probably new to this addition.  As are what I expect are new paragraphs near the end of every chapter that relates how every single disease in history could be weaponized.  It is disturbing to see a book like this play on people's fears of bioterrorism.<br /><br />It's unfortunate because the historical sections of the book which are the bulk of the first parts of each chapter are well done if a bit dry.  Dr. Bollett has turned the traditional view around a bit by considering how human history has impacted epidemic disease rather than the other way around.  If the book had stayed on this path it would have been decent, if not great.  Somehow this new edition has lost its way.lk of the first parts of each chapter are well done if a bit dry.

I learned to read in the great science fiction tradition of which the alternate history novel was a popular enough subgenre with some great examples: The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick for one.  Though I admire Philip Roth greatly, I wasn't sure how his stab at alternate history was going to stand up to my science fiction past.  Fortunately, it stands up very well.<br /><br />One reason why this novel stands up so well is that it is an alternate history novel only in the most superficial sense.  Yes, we are in a world where Charles Lindbergh defeats FDR in 1940 and begins the \\"nazification\\" of America.  But this is just the canvas for the examination of a family--the fictional Roth family where our author/narrator is a little boy living with an older brother, a cousin and his parents in the Jewish neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey.  By the time the novel ends, the Lindbergh administration runs out to be just a two year interregnum before things straighten out and American history turns back into what it is now.  This two year space, however, gives Roth an opportunity to do what he does so well which is to detail the inner lives of human beings.  In this case, the extraordinary experience of a virulently anti-Semitic America allows Roth to put a group of basically normal, decent people through harrowing events including his young alter ego.<br /><br />Roth's ability to send his characters on a journey of tremendous change while remaining true to their character is incredible.  We see cousin Alvin reach for honor by fighting the Nazis for Canada and then fall back to his lower nature when he is wounded.  We see charming and talented brother Sandy fall under the sway the new regime but then give up and focus his attention to more normal teenage concerns: girls.  We see his parents stepping up and being strong under great pressure, being consistent but often in ways incomprehensible to their children.  All in all, we see a very real family brilliantly drawn.<br /><br />And, of course, within this fictional alternate history, we can detect Roth's sly commentary on the injustices that still remain in America today.  In his accurate description of Newark of the 1940's, we see our real America undergoing a seemingly believable social change.  In a world where fear of terror has convinced some of us to slowly give away our freedoms, The Plot Against America stands as a reminder of what our country can go through if we're not vigilant.<br /><br />In the end, I found myself enjoying this novel much more than I expected going in.

All of which make this book a very enjoyable read.<br /><br />On the other hand, when you're dealing with a master like Saramago, unfairly or not, you hold him to a higher standard--himself.  This is not his best book.  I think that what is missing is the \\"importance\\" of his other novels.  What we learn in this novel doesn't seem nearly worth the effort.  Unlike masterpieces like Blindness and The Cave, this novel's revelations seem more superficial than the deep discoveries of some of his other work.<br /><br />Certainly, this is a novel worth reading but for a reader new to Saramago, I would start someplace else first and come to this one later.

The differences between the two books, however, are striking.  This is not to say that one is necessarily better than the other but, rather, that each has its strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />The first thing of note in Ms. Jardine's book is that she has a case to make--that a portrait previously identified as botanist John Ray is, in fact, a portrait of Hooke.  This may not seem important to the casual reader but it has been one of the commonalities of Hooke research that no image of him remains.  (Whether through accident or the machinations of bitter scientists like Newton, no one knows.)  In fact, it is her argument over the authenticity of this portrait (which has some merit) that seems her real incentive for writing this book.  In some sense, the rest of the book is an afterthought.<br /><br />This is not to say that the rest of the book is not worthwhile.  It most certainly is.  Ms. Jardine tells her story well.  Ms. Jardine's book has one major advantage over Mr. Inwood's: it is much more readable.  Her style is much lighter and engaging.  She is telling the story for a general audience whereas Mr. Inwood's main audience seems to be scientists and historians.  She vividly recreates his youth on the Isle of Wight and his flight to London.  She is excellent with outlining Hooke's tendencies towards hypochondria and the many tonics he took to keep himself going at a hectic pace.  I am also very impressed with her telling of Hooke's conflict with the Huygens family which often gets short shrift in Hooke's story due to the much better known conflict with Newton.<br /><br />Still, overall, Inwood's book gives a much better sense of the man.  There is a real depth missing in this book.  Ms. Jardine talks of Hooke's conflict with Newton near the very start of the book and then hardly mentions it again, though this is probably the defining time of Hooke's life.  Her ability to discuss Hooke's scientific discoveries seems rather limited and even her discussion of his architectural work seems rather superficial.  She is also rather gentle with Hooke, the man, glossing over evidence of his many affairs with housekeepers and what almost certainly became an incestuous relationship with his niece as well as taking it easy on his notoriously bad temper, though she does acknowledge it.<br /><br />At least Ms. Jardine recognizes Hooke's weaknesses as a scientist and doesn't try to convince us he is a disrespected genius.

He was a workman--the best of workmen and he deserved respect for that--but no genius.<br /><br />A five-star book would be a collaboration between Ms. Jardine and Mr. Inwood.  Combining her writing skills with his research and scientific knowledge would do Hooke the best justice.

I believe this war was the most important event of the twentieth century, creating world political and social conditions we are still trying to work through today.  At this point, 90 years after the start of the war, it is difficult to find an author with a new take on taking us through this history.  Mr. Persico has made a valiant attempt and, for the most part, he succeeds.<br /><br />The 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of the year 1918 is, of course, the moment when World War I came to an end.  What Mr. Persico does is tell the story of the war with its last day as his starting point.  He does this for a couple reasons.  First, he wants to make the point that, as the armistice had been signed before this day, the casualties of November 11th were pointless.  He then uses the senseless casualties of the last day to bring to life much of the senselessness of the previous four years.  He needs to do this to bring the scope of the war into a focus that he can cover in 400 readable pages, using the stories of many individual soldiers to get at the heart of the matter.  And we do manage to get a lot of personal stories here: from the great (Foch, Pershing) to the soon to be great (McArthur, Truman, Patton) to the lesser known.  And he gives us at least a taste of the German side with, of course, Hitler, Ludendorff and others.<br /><br />The difficulty with the book is that the jumping around in time and place occasionally makes things difficult to follow.  And he often gets away from his \\"last day\\" conceit, spending most of his pages on other days which makes his conceit seem somewhat artificial.  Though, to his credit, he does tie everything together rather well by the end with a brief but lucid commentary on the effect of the war.<br /><br />Mr. Persico may not have written the best book on the war but he has given us a fine addition to the literature that can be read in a reasonable amount of time.  A quality many tomes on the topic do not share.A quality many tomes on the topic do not share.	2004-11-16

Fortunately, Mr. Greenblatt did not disappoint.  Will in the World is one of the best Shakespeare biographies I have read.<br /><br />The problem for any biographer of Shakespeare is, of course, the minimal records left behind.  Apart from some information left in church and financial records, there is almost nothing of certainty known about Shakespeare.  A Shakespearean biographer, then, is forced to make a certain number of guesses and speculations if he is going to come up with any kind of complete story for a reader.  Historically, these speculations have ranged from the mundane to the outrageous but they always must rely on the reader's trust of the author's scholarship and how it relates to our own understanding of Shakespeare.  I find Mr. Greenblatt to be a very believable biographer.<br /><br />The main reason I find Mr. Greenblatt's work to be so compelling is the correlations he finds between well-recorded historical events, what is known of Shakespeare and, ultimately, how this finds its way into Shakespeare's work.  For example, in the first chapter Greenblatt describes a visit Queen Elizabeth made to Kenilworth where Leicester puts on a grand display for her.  Now, was Shakespeare present at these festivities, perhaps even as a young country player?  There is no way to know for sure but Greenblatt quotes Robert Langham's letter describing the event and takes us to lines from Midsummer Nights Dream.  Shakespeare's recreation of the event is striking.  Perhaps he was there.<br /><br />The other reason I like Greenblatt's work on Shakespeare is that he makes him human.  Unlike Harold Bloom, for example (whose work I also greatly admire), who has a distracting tendency to deify Shakespeare, Mr. Greenblatt keeps Shakespeare deeply rooted in the real world.  No less a genius for that, Greenblatt's Shakespeare is a man whose work was influenced by his life and experiences and not pulled wholesale from the Muse.<br /><br />Again and again Greenblatt impresses with his extensive knowledge of history and Shakespeare's work.  In doing so, he takes us through Shakespeare's life and time from beginning to end.  In the end, he leaves us with a picture of a man and his times--if not a sharp as a photograph then at least as beautiful as an impressionist painting.ld.

Every year I teach Hooke's Law of elasticity to my students.  Additionally, I had been aware of the importance of his book Micrographia and, since I consider myself a bit of a student on Isaac Newton, I had known something of his conflict with Newton over the Principia.  However, I admit my knowledge of Hooke was sketchy.  As a student of scientific history, I wanted that rectified so I turned to this book.  It was certainly a rewarding experience.<br /><br />Without a doubt, I learned much more than I ever knew about Robert Hooke and I gained a new respect for the man.  Hooke's areas of interest were wide and his curiosity unbounded.  I was completely unaware of his work with Christopher Wren and his own contributions to architecture and the reconstruction of London after the Great Fire.  Additionally, I came to admire his willingness to stand behind the virtues of science (as in his prescient speculations on evolution) in the face of religious prejudice.  And, apart from learning about Hooke, this book gives a deeper understanding of what it was like to be a working scientist in the early years of scientific exploration.  It is certainly an excellent example of scientific biography.<br /><br />There are a couple weaknesses with the book that kept coming back to me as I read, however.  The first has to do with style; particularly, the style that I've noticed most often in British histories of science.  Namely, the overabundance of information.  This book is packed with detail.  Much more detail than is really necessary in telling Hooke's story.  Inwood often used Hooke's diary to make excellent points about the man often with respect to his day-to-day life, relationships and personalities but he also used it to excess in describing the myriad details of Hooke's work and investigations.  Fortunately, I'm used to this style of writing and even enjoy it to an extent but even I found some of the lists of Hooke's doings and travels tedious going.<br /><br />Still, it is the second flaw I find to be much more serious.  One of Inwood's main goals seems to be to rehabilitate Hooke and give him his rightful place among history's great scientists.  In this, I feel Inwood failed.  In England this book was published as The Man Who Knew Too Much and this seems to me to be about right.  But in America we say \\"a jack of all trades and a master of none.\\"  Hooke never comes across to me as a genius.  Extraordinarily energetic and technically brilliant, he didn't seem to me to have the kind of mind that Newton and Huygens had.  Perhaps if he had focused his abilities more he would have had their kind of triumphs but I doubt it.<br /><br />And Inwood did nothing to dispel the image of Hooke as a bitter man who tried to claim the better work of others as his own.  The repetition of Hooke's own claims to priority in his diary, letters and in the Royal Society records are probably only a fraction of the claims he made in his life and these alone are tedious.  Inwood tries to make the point that the bitter man history describes could not have maintained the kind of friendships Hooke did in his life but I find that to be an argument without merit.  Even the worst men have friends and Hooke was by no means a bad man.  Inwood's book gives a picture of a lower class man trying throughout his life to gain the respect of the upper class and basically failing.  We can sympathize with Hooke's struggles but that does not change the fact that, though often unfairly treated, many of his problems were of his own making.<br /><br />In the final analysis, however, this is a very worthwhile book for anyone interested in the history of science.  Hooke was, in his own way, an amazing man and it is fascinating to see this revolutionary time in science through the eyes of one of its most important supporters.  In Hooke we see the forerunner of every man and woman who puts their all into science and tries tirelessly to make great discoveries.  He may not be at the pinnacle but he deserves his place in scientific history.nd tries tirelessly to make great discoveries.

Often, it takes a few years before the book appears but usually it is worth it.  Certainly that is the case with this collection of poems by Mark Strand.<br /><br />The poem that drew me to Strand is \\"A Piece of the Storm.\\"  This poem is eleven brilliant lines that, in its imagery and complexity, has incredible emotional impact.  It is certainly one of the best poems I've read in the past ten years.  I'm tempted to quote it in its entirely (as I do to friends) in this review but I'll resist the temptation.  Consider just this one line that gives title to the book: \\"A snowflake, a blizzard of one, weightless, entered your room...\\"  Notice the juxtaposition of descriptions of the snowflake.  It is a blizzard, yet it is weightless.  And it is the heavy force of this snowflake that leads the poem to its emotional epiphany.  Needless to say, I will be turning the lines of the poem over in my mind for years to come.<br /><br />As for the rest of this slim volume, if it doesn't quite live up to the promise of \\"A Piece of the Storm,\\" there is much here that is worthwhile, particularly in the first half.  \\"Untitled,\\" \\"The Next Time,\\" \\"The Night, The Porch,\\" and \\"Some Last Words\\" are all excellent.  The last two sections I found much less interesting though the second part of \\"What It Was\\" is quite powerful.<br /><br />There are still those of us that believe in the power of poetry and believe there are still poets writing today worth reading.  Mark Strand is proof of that.	2004-10-18

In the past few years, The Daily Show has become a journalistic phenomenon despite the fact that they are clearly a \\"fake news\\" organization.  Now, the writers of the show have taken the qualities that make their presentation of current events so popular and turned their sights on American history.<br /><br />America is structured like an American government textbook complete with the ubiquitous \\"property of\\" label on the inside front cover to the discussion questions and classroom activities at the end of every chapter.  This text, however, reads unlike any other government book you've ever read.  After giving their own take on the founding of the United States and the three branches of government, America gets to the real heart of democracy--lobbyists, money and the media--with a glance at possible future Americas and the horror that is the rest of the world.  Even satirists seem to realize that, though our system is not perfect, its better than what's going on anywhere else in the world.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is why I believe this book and The Daily Show are so successful.  Though they poke fun at our weird world and, in particular, the strangeness that is America, there is a certain optimism in their fun.  They are never mean-spirited.  They want to point our flaws through humor but in a way that still shows an underlying liking for this country.  We could use more of that.<br /><br />America is an excellent book but by no means a perfect one.  I'm afraid it's not going to have a very long shelf life.  It's a little too focused on current events to be read much 4 years from now.  But as a source of laughs to get us through this seminal moment in America history, it's worth its weight in gold.	2004-10-17

I met the astronomy teacher there--I teach physics and math-- and we proceeded to watch what we could of the transit of Venus, the passage of the planet Venus across the face of the sun.  It dawned cloudy but we did manage to see the last half-hour or so and we got a number of excellent photographs of the event.  It was a great morning--a chance to see a very rare astronomical event.  I don't think I'll ever forget it.<br /><br />Because of my experience, when I saw this book I couldn't resist taking a look.  Sheehan & Westfall do a very good job at explaining the science of the transit, detailing views of the transit in maps & photographs, and in going through the history of the attempts at viewing and measuring the transit.  Particularly interesting is their discussions of using the transit to measure the earth-sun distance and the number of voyages of exploration undertaken (including Captain Cook's) whose primary purpose was to find a good vantage from which to observe the transit.<br /><br />Transits of Venus come in pairs separated by approximately 8 years.  These pairs are then separated from each other by better than 100 years.  Before 2004, the last transit was in 1882.  After the transit of 2012, the next won't occur until 2117.  Granted, this book is not going to hold any interest to anyone who is not interested in astronomy.  But if observing the skies is something that fascinates you as it does me, read this book.  Then put it on a shelf and pull it out again in 2012.  Prepare yourself for the next transit because if you miss it next time, you won't get another chance.  You'll have to leave the book for your grandchildren.	2004-10-10

There are just a handful of them but Margaret Atwood is undoubtedly one of them.  Every time I read one of her books I go away impressed.  Oryx and Crake is no exception.<br /><br />This novel is another novel of a dystopian future along the lines of The Handmaid's Tale.  Here we have a narrator, Snowman, telling us of his friend, Crake, who destroys human life so his genetically altered humans (called Crakers) can have the earth as their own.  Oryx is a former sex slave who Crake has found to educate his Crakers but with whom Snowman falls madly in love, leading Crake to take vengeance.  Snowman is telling us all this in flashbacks as he tries to get by in a world where he is, as far as he knows, the only \\"normal\\" human left.<br /><br />Of course, this is only a sketchy outline of what is, in fact, a novel with incredible depth.  Ms. Atwood's ability to draw for us a very possible future of high-tech \\"gated\\" communities separated from the mass of common people, a world where everyone relies on the Internet, sex, drugs and genetic alteration to make there lives livable is amazing.  She is also gifted at creating memorable characters like Snowman and Oryx, in particular, and an entire world of altered beings like pigoons (genetically altered pigs), rakunks (a cross between a racoon and a skunk) and the Crakers.<br /><br />Thematically, the fact that this horrible world Atwood creates does not seem so far away is chilling.  It makes a reader really think about everything from the social effect of the Internet to the ethics of genetic manipulation.  What I was pleased to find most of all, however, is the note of optimism.  Yes, things are horrible but, even after the destruction, human beings (normal ones and genetically altered ones) survive somehow and struggle to begin again.<br /><br />There are so many ways human beings may bring about there own destruction but I believe strongly that, somehow, people will always find some way to survive and build again even if brought to the brink.  Ms. Atwood has given us a version of this and it is plausible and well-done, if disturbing.  I recommend it.how, people will always find some way to survive and build again even if brought to the brink.

Despite the fact that I was exhausted from a long day at work, I was pleased to find that Mr. Spiegelman is a highly entertaining speaker.  During the hour he spoke on his new book, In the Shadow of No Towers, I was completely absorbed.<br /><br />Needless to say, the book itself is excellent.  It's oversize format mirrors the size of a newspaper as the book unfolds.  The first half is a sequence of 10 full-page, multi-panel cartoons that illustrate Mr. Spiegelman's experience in the aftermath of 9/11.  Living as he does on Canal Street in NYC with a daughter in a school only blocks from ground zero, Mr. Spiegelman is an eyewitness of incredible feeling--an entire spectrum of feelings he does not hesitate sharing with his readers.<br /><br />The second half of the book are reprints of ancient newspaper cartoon panels from the dawn of comics.  Mr. Spiegelman used these old strips as a comfort in the days after 9/11 and as an inspiration for his current work.  As someone who has little knowledge of these early days of comics, I found this section to be as interesting as the first half was moving.<br /><br />Mr. Spiegelman is an artist of uncommon skill.  His unique style made him a standout among the artists at The New Yorker in the past dozen years.  However, he is also a storyteller of uncommon skill.  Unfortunately, he has kept this skill under wraps since the achievements of Maus.  I am glad he has found his narrative voice again.  I just hope that it doesn't take another tragedy on the scale of the Holocaust or 9/11 to make him exercise that skill again.	2004-09-27

Though Mr. Folsom's work has never had the success of Dan Brown's, he works a lot of the same territory--thrillers with a \\"conspiracy theory\\" subtext.  The Exile is another good example of the genre.<br /><br />This novel, however, will unlikely have the success of The DaVinci Code.  In some ways Mr. Folsom is a better writer.  He certainly writes a better chase sequence--the opening 60 pages of this novel are as exciting as any I've read with an excellent red herring, slight-of-hand result.  But successful novels like this are often helped by controversy and Mr. Folsom isn't likely to generate much here.<br /><br />Though I find The Exile to be in many ways as controversial as The DaVinci Code, the choice of target makes all the difference.  Mr. Brown has religion and the Catholic Church, whose adherents were quick to jump at the publication of the novel.  It is the LAPD that receives the biggest slap from Mr. Folsom--incompetence and killing squads anyone?--but it is unlikely that anyone will feel it important to stand up for the police.  In some ways, I think that's too bad; and telling about the state of the American psyche.<br /><br />And, of course, there is the fact that Mr. Folsom's conspiracy centers around a surviving Romanov dynasty trying to come back to power in Russia.  Something that's not like to generate that much interest to an American reader despite the fact that the Romanov's seem \\"hot\\" right now.<br /><br />Still, all in all, The Exile is a good read.  Mr. Folsom is an excellent writer who does generate a lot of excitement and a pair of excellent characters in John Barron & Raymond Thorne.  Yes, the later parts of the book do get a bit predictable and he dips into the chase scene well a little too often and, in my opinion, he would have a better novel if he would have ended the novel halfway down page 701 instead of wrapping it up rather tritely.  These are small complaints, however. Readers who enjoy thrillers will enjoy this one.p rather tritely.  These are small complaints, however.

Though this novel continues her pattern of subtly eerie thrillers, I don't know if this novel stands out enough to do it for her in this world of Dan Brown-type success.  It's unfortunate because she is a strong writer.<br /><br />In this novel, Ms. Goodman's protagonist is Juno McKay, a college drop-out due to pregnancy who has spent the past 15 years bringing up her daughter alone after her husband goes mad, tries to kill them and ends up in an insane asylum.  Following in her father's footsteps, she has become a restorer of stained glass.  While restoring a window for her should-have-been alma mater, her best friend dies and she becomes swept up in the investigation of the death.<br /><br />There are plenty of twist and turns in the story though the real joy of her stories are not surprises (they aren't really that surprising) but the prose.  I may not really be able to believe that it takes Juno as long as it does to read the diary pages she finds (I mean, it's 10 minutes reading max and there's a mystery here, for crying out loud) and she's pretty dense about some things (like Neil, for instance) but, like the Hudson that flows through the center of this story (OK, I also enjoy<br /><br />the fact that for the second time now, she has placed key action in the north tip of Manhattan--places I know because I live here), it flows easily towards its wild conclusion.  It's a good read.<br /><br />If Ms. Goodman is showing an overall weakness, it is borrowing from herself.  She stays well within her safety net here: another northeast school campus intrigue with a well-educated but struggling woman protagonist.  However, it's difficult to be critical since many authors tend to stay within a certain milleau and they're always told to \\"write what you know.\\"  Still, it might be nice for her to break some new ground in her next novel.  Though I have to admit, I am interested in what obsesses her about water: The Lake of Dead Languages, The Seduction of Water and, now, The Drowning Tree.

I find the book to be fun and certainly provocative but, first and foremost, a novel.  In other words, \\"based on facts\\" or no, simply fiction.  The fact that the Church would find it necessary to defend itself against the assertions of this novel never occurred to me.  And yet, here we have a book that purports to point out all of the misinformation in this novel.<br /><br />On one level, this book does exactly what it purports to do:  it goes through a number of important points explaining the meaning of gnosticism, the Church's stand on Mary Magdalene and the divinity of Jesus, and certain historical points about Constantine, the Templars and so on.  The authors also take a stab at artistic analysis with DaVinci's painting of Mona Lisa, The Madonna of the Rocks and The Last Supper.  They make a good solid case for the Church's position and against the \\"facts\\" of Brown's novel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the authors are not going to convince anyone who is not already on their side.  The fact that this book is written with a scholarly tone and an overabundance of footnotes doesn't help but the main reason is their attitude.  Any writers who automatically dismiss and talk down to the very audience they should be trying to reach are going to lose.  These authors' obvious disdain for people who might be swayed by Brown are automatically going to put these readers on the defensive.  Of course, this may simply be a reflection of the Church's attitude right now and why so many Catholics are falling away.<br /><br />The authors would have been better served by controlling some of their inflammatory language against other authors (Brown, Margaret Starbird and the authors of Holy Blood, Holy Grail, for example) and \\"radical feminists\\" and simply making their argument.  It is unfortunate that the Catholic Church has not done a better job at educating its flock, leaving them open to being misled, but the fact remains that talking down to the flock is not going to get them back.<br /><br />What I think is so often forgotten is that the important things under discussion are ultimately matters of faith, not fact.  We simply cannot know what Constantine's motivations were.  We can argue about it and bring history, archeology and the like into play.  But we cannot know.  Or, more importantly, we cannot know that Jesus was divine and never had relations with Mary Magdalene; rather, we believe.  And if the Church is going to sway people in their direction, their going to need to be open to the fact that there actually are arguments on both sides and that \\"because we say so\\" is not convincing, especially given the Church's track record with truth.

And if the Church is going to sway people in their direction, their going to need to be open to the fact that there actually are arguments on both sides and that \\"because we say so\\" is not convincing, especially given the Church's track record with truth.  What we need to have is the better argument. <br /> <br />This book has better facts but not a better argument.  As a Catholic, I had hoped for better.	2004-09-01

Perhaps best known for his PBS show and book The Elegant Universe, Greene is a professor of physics at Columbia University and one of the theorists behind modern string theory.  In The Fabric of the Cosmos he again tries to bring string theory to the masses.  And he does a very good job of it.  However, this book does much more than that.<br /><br />The bulk of this book (the first 300 pages or so) is a science/history lesson of the best sort.  His discussion of the meaning of absolute space, the direction of time and its link to the concept of entropy may be the best I've ever read.  Not only does he give us the history of these concepts with the respective scientists who worked them out but he also takes the time to explain these concepts in depth and detail without resorting to math or technical language.  Anyone willing to put in a minimum of effort will gain a lot of fundamental physical knowledge from this book.<br /><br />And, of course, he tops it off with a very understandable discussion of strings and branes with the expected discussion of the feasibility of time machines, transporters and the like.  But this is really just the icing on the cake of the previous discussion.  He gives us a glimpse of the cutting edge of physics but he realizes that there's a lot of work left to be done and cutting edge physics is always in the process of change--sometimes very dramatic change.<br /><br />Dr. Greene deserve a special compliment for his prose.  Scientists are often mediocre writers for readers outside the field but Greene's prose is very readable.  His personality comes through and a reader cannot ignore is love of physics.  He also puts his prejudices for string theory right out on the table and reminds us all to keep an open mind when looking at science.  Any educated reader would be foolish to pass up a chance to read this book.ad this book.	2004-09-01

Many people would say I'm obsessed but it only takes a book like this one to remind myself that I'm in the minor leagues.<br /><br />Part memoir and part peek into the world of book collecting, Baxter tells of his youth in the wilds of Australia where, like many of us, he delved into the world of comic book and science fiction collecting.  He matured along the way with an interest in Graham Greene before dumping that collection and moving onto other literary interests.<br /><br />And he did not stay in the wilds of Australia forever.  He travelled and made his way up in the world of film and publishing.  Baxter has had the fortune as a film critic, writer and collector to meet a number of interesting people, from the writers he collected to eccentric bookmen like Martin Stone.  The book has a definite British flavor, though Baxter has made some forays into the United States.  Still, any book collector will see things he recognizes in Baxter's experiences and, in some cases, things we wished we could have experienced ourselves.<br /><br />Let's face it, a person with a passion for book collecting will feel some jealousy when reading of some of Baxter's finds and encounters.  Unfortunately, most of us do not have the means and/or opportunity to do some of the things Baxter has done.  But this does not totally diminish the fun in seeing how he was able to come to have the experiences he had and it makes for a great read for anyone interested in books.	2004-08-18

As a teacher of math and science, I am always looking for books that can make these subjects a little easier for my students.  I am also a big believer in math and science books for the general reader.  Unfortunately, I don't think this book qualifies. <br /> <br />That is not to say that this is not a good book.  For a college student in a logic course, this book is a godsend.  It is certainly a clear and concise development of the subject.  Indeed, for anyone with a solid background in college level math who is interested in the subject of logic, this book is excellent.  It is full of historical background (which I love) and it gives a lot of practical examples in logic, many from standardized exams but also some everyday stuff.  And Ms. Bennett does point out many common logical fallacies, which is important. <br /> <br />However, when it comes right down to it, this is a book in pure logic.  If you're not familiar with the p's and q's of symbolic logic, this is going to be tough going after awhile.  By the time we reach the truth tables, the book will seem to be a flurry of variables.  The fact is, no general reader is going to make it this far. <br /> <br />It's unfortunate, because I can see in places that Ms. Bennett has the ability to write a book about logic that anyone could pick up, read and enjoy.  But this is not that book.  If you are interested in mathematics and have the background, read this book.  Otherwise, this book is not for you.	2004-08-18

Of his novels, War With the Newts is probably the best known.  And with good reason.  It is an excellent story.<br /><br />Flirting with the apocalyptic tradition in science fiction, this novel tells the story of the discovery of large, intelligent sea creatures off a small island \\"west of Sumatra.\\"  Initially curiosities, their intelligence makes them excellent workers for underwater projects for humans.  Unfortunately for humans, these creatures are in fact quite smart enough and, over the course of a few years, develop to the point where they can challenge people for the domination of the earth.  Which they do quite effectively.<br /><br />Written in a number of styles--journalistic and scientific in addition to straightforward prose that switches points of view--it is very engaging.  Granted, the prose is a little more formal as befits a novel written in the 1930's and the translator has kept that formal feeling but I am quite fond of this style.  And Capek's perceptive examination of the politics of this period in his tale of newts and man is impressive.<br /><br />Capek is often thought of as a science fiction writer but, as is the case with many writers of this genre, his appeal is much wider.  Otherwise, why would his novels and plays still be read nearly 80 years later.  Anyone with a taste for good, intellectual writing would enjoy this novel.	2004-08-18

And the poem sequence &quot;Somewhere in Ecclesiastes&quot; also has some powerful images though it, too, never strays far from the theme of death--the death of children and &quot;unexplained death.&quot;<br />Some people find poetry of death &amp; family too heavy.  If you like this kind of poetry, however, as I do, you will likely find some poetry worth reading here.  I have yet to come across a book of poetry that is uniformly powerful on every page but Mr. Mitcham does a very good job here.	2004-07-06

Now, I just wish I had read this before visiting the Duomo in Florence some years ago.  This is an excellent description of the raising of the dome over the cathedral in Florence at the beginning of the fifteenth century led by the architect Filippo Brunelleschi.<br />There are three things that I particularly like about this book: first, it is an excellent description of the tremendous work invested by literally entire communities to raise a structure like a mediaeval cathedral.  Yes, Brunelleschi was the genius behind the dome but it took thousands of workers decades to make his vision a reality.  Thinking of the skyscrapers we raise today with the help of modern machines, raising these churches was an incredible achievement.<br />Second, this book shows how scientific and engineering discoveries are often lost and rediscovered.  The Roman methods of building aqueducts, arches and domes (like the Pantheon in Rome) had long been lost and many of their methods are still only vaguely understood.  Still, Brunelleschi was able to study these structures (much as his work is studied now), rediscover old methods and invent even better ones to produce his work.  This is something seen over and over again in the sciences: a discovery is made and, because it is not understood at the time or the explanation is lost somehow, it is forgotten, only to be rediscovered later.<br />Third, this book shows how difficult it is to understand some of the amazing achievements of antiquity.  Even today, though the dome stands as a monument to his genius, we don't fully understand how Brunelleschi was able to make it work.  Engineers and architects still make pilgrimages to Florence in an attempt to understand how this dome was built and remains standing after nearly six centuries.  Still, a full understanding eludes us.  Part of this is due to Brunelleschi own penchant for secrecy but that doesn't stop it from boggling the mind--how modern technology cannot unravel the mystery of this structure.<br />Having climbed up into the dome myself, I felt very close to what King described in this book and would recommend it as a must read to anyone who has visited Florence or is thinking of doing so.  Even without a visit, however, this slim volume is worth reading for anyone with an interest in science or architecture.chi own penchant for secrecy but that doesn't stop it from boggling the mind--how modern technology cannot unravel the mystery of this structure.<br />Having climbed up into the dome myself, I felt very close to what King described in this book and would recommend it as a must read to anyone who has visited Florence or is thinking of doing so.

First and perhaps most importantly, it is simply a good story. This type of literary thriller is very popular right now thanks to writers like Dan Brown and this tale of a book, the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili, with its codes, riddles and mysterious meanings, does the genre proud.<br />But this novel has much more going for it.  Perhaps most importantly, this novel has excellently drawn characters.  Tom Sullivan, from whose point of view we see the action of this story, may be the most realistic character I have ever read in a novel of this type.  He actually comes across as a real college student with the typical joys and troubles suddenly thrown into a rare type of excitement.  His three roommates--Gil, Charlie and, especially, Paul--are also well-drawn.<br />I was also impressed by the seamlessness of the prose.  Even though The Rule of Four is the product of two authors, Caldwell &amp; Thomason have somehow managed to find a single voice for their story.  That is a real achievement.<br />The Rule of Four is not quite perfect.  The bulk of the action is finished by this point but I found the last chapter to be disappointing.  It just didn't feel right that Tom, however much you pull for him, deserved to be on the verge of getting everything he desired.  In a book that didn't seem to stray too far from realism for the most part, could hint at this fairy tale ending.<br />Still, this is a small complaint about a book that deserves to be read.  I recommend it highly.	2004-06-30

This play, written by a pair of Czech brothers, gave us the word and the concept of &quot;robot.&quot;  (R.U.R. stands for Rossum's Universal Robots.)  It is unfortunate, however, that more people haven't read this play because it is very good.<br />Written in the intellectual ferment between the world wars, R.U.R. tells the story of a world where mechanical robots (the Czech word for &quot;worker&quot;) are taking the place of human workers.  Though the human manufacturers of the robots all seem to have noble intentions (apart from the desire to get rich), things get out of hand when the robots revolt against their human masters and destroy the human race.  The play ends with the hope for reinvention of the human race through the robots.<br />Though first produced in the 1920's, it is amazing how little this play has become dated.  There is an obvious formalism in the dialogue which places it in its period but the social themes and commentary remain pertinent for a modern audience.  The vision Capek had which is so predictive of our modern relationship with science and invention is truly amazing.  This is a play I would love to see produced.<br />Allegorical and satirical, The Insect Play has also aged well though its lack of conflict makes it a lesser experience than R.U.R.; however, with its flighty &quot;butterflies,&quot; miserly &quot;beetles&quot; and war-like &quot;ants,&quot; The Insect Play is another bit of clever social commentary.	2004-06-30

I am fascinated by the relationship between Johannes Kepler and the lesser known but crucially important Tycho Brahe.  Still, it was only about a year ago that I read Kitty Ferguson's excellent book, Tycho &amp; Kepler.  In addition, I was rather turned off by the Gilders' assertion that Kepler had murdered Brahe in order to get his astronomical data.  Ultimately, however, I felt I had to give the book a chance.<br />There is a lot of good stuff here.  Though not as in-depth as Ferguson, the Gilders produce a very readable outline of the lives and relationship between Kepler &amp; Brahe.  It is solid prose that reads very quickly and hits all of the major points.  I also enjoy their use of primary sources such as Kepler's letters and other writings.  I felt I had a much more personal understanding of Kepler--his obsessions and irritations--after reading this.  However, it is clear the Gilders prefer Brahe and, though I feel he is very underrated historically, he is by no means an angel himself.  Still, if they wouldn't have gotten into the forensic information about Brahe's death they would have written a wonderful dual biography.<br />So, what to make of this forensic evidence?  I am generally suspect of these investigations because what can you really know for sure 400 years after the fact?  Well, I found their evidence very convincing of one thing: that Tycho Brahe was murdered, most likely by mercury poisoning.  On the other hand, I felt their assertion that Kepler was the perpetrator much less convincing.  Certainly, Kepler was difficult to work with and sometimes weak on ethics where his science was concerned; however, it is a long way from jerk to murderer.<br />Brahe was a nobleman recently expelled from his homeland by his enemies now dealing with a court at Prague ruled by an increasingly mad &quot;emperor.&quot;  No one knows the extent of Brahe's household including servants and minor assistants at the time of his death.  Certainly Kepler ranked high among Brahe's assistants but the two did not really get along.  Is it likely that Brahe would have had Kepler at his side during an excruciating illness, taking a cup of mercury-laced milk from him at his bedside? I don't think so.  And could Kepler have kept this murder a secret when he was so apt to rage and verbal self-flagellation?  Again, I don't think so.<br />Ultimately, I think the Gilders have done a service by bringing out the simple fact of Brahe's murder.  I, for one, had never come across such an assertion in my reading and I am glad to know it.  But they go too far to accuse Kepler.  There is a tendency these days to fling whatever mud we can at the &quot;great men&quot; of history.

After reading that book and enjoying it, I had to come back and read this novel, the first to feature Harvard symbologist extraordinaire Robert Langdon.  I enjoyed it but I can see why this novel was initially less successful than its follow-up.<br />Certainly many of the same qualities are there: an excellently drawn cast of characters and a mystery shrouded in the mists of religion.  If nothing else, this book is worthwhile for its excursions through Rome and the Vatican, touching on many of the biggest legends of the home of Roman Catholicism.  And Brown does have a very readable prose style, ratcheting up the mystery and tension.<br />The problems I have with this novel are two.  The first is a simple one: though I can suspend my disbelief as well as the next guy, the helicopter scene near the end of the novel crossed the line for me.  So much about it was impossible that it ruined what I think is so important to the type of story Brown writes--a basic believability that allows you to accept so many of Brown's revelations.<br />The second problem is deeper.  Whereas The DaVinci Code dealt with religion &amp; art, this novel deals with religion &amp; science.  As a Roman Catholic physics teacher myself, these are both subjects very near and dear to me.  And, in fact, I usually enjoy this type of book that encourages me to think more deeply about these two loves of mine; however, my problem here is that both science and religion come off as so extraordinarily bad.  If we look at what Brown is saying, we would be led to believe that the highest levels of leadership and achievement in both fields are deeply, if not fatally, corrupted.  This steady undertone of negativism cast a pall over the book for me.  It seems such a pessimistic view of our world and I tend to be more of an optimist, I guess.<br />Still, there's a lot of interest and fun here.  Certainly anyone who enjoyed The DaVinci Code is bound to enjoy this.  And it does make me wonder where Brown is going to take Mr. Langdon next.Code is bound to enjoy this.

Back in the 70's, when I used to visit my grandmother's house, I remember spending a lot of time reading some of those early collections of Peanuts cartoon strips.  They are one of the many great memories of my youth.  Now, we have a collection of the very first Peanuts strips.  Magnificent!<br />How many of us still remember the beginning?  So many things would grow and change.  Violet and Patty (not Peppermint Patty) were Charlie Brown's &quot;girlfriends&quot; whom he could torment as much as he was tormented by them.  Violet was actually the first to pull the football away from Charlie Brown.  Snoopy was still a dog with no words.  Schroeder is very prominent as a child prodigy with his love of piano and growing love of Beethoven.  Charlie Brown is the catcher for the baseball team.  Lucy &amp; Linus make there first appearances.  And so much more.  Still, we can see this wonderful world taking shape and we can see how it will become to be this most beloved of comics.<br />This volume also contains a nice introduction by Garrison Keillor and concludes with an interesting interview of Charles Schultz, enlightening us to some of his own feelings about his strip and what has become of the world of comics.<br />As the first of a projected twenty-five volumes collecting all the Peanuts strips to be released every six months for the next twelve years, all I can say is I can't wait for volume 2.	2004-06-16

I was tempted to skip this one.  I'm glad I didn't.<br />Reunion is the story of a college professor/poet named Charles who goes back to his thirtieth college reunion.  While there, he experiences a vivid flashback to his senior year in college when he was in love with a ballerina named Juliana.  Through the flashback we get to experience this brief, fiery affair from beginning to end.  It is a wonderful experience.<br />It is not a wonderful experience in the way one might expect, however.  Really, it is a rather ordinary love affair of a 22-year-old complete with the intense range of emotions from passion and doubt to jealously and joy.  And it is in its ordinariness that this novel is so special.  Because, excepting the end where a few surprises muddle the works, its ordinariness allows Lightman an extraordinary truthfulness.<br />Charles is perhaps a more real character than any I've read.  I felt I understood this man--his reactions to his current lover, his former classmates, his memories.  I felt that he was having the same kind of emotional experiences that I have had.  And though Charles' story is his own, his emotions are universal.  This is a very difficult effect to produce and Lightman does it brilliantly here.<br />Of course, this is a brief novel but, in this case, perhaps that is best.  The quick read helps convey the intensity of the experience, particularly the flashbacks.  And though the protagonist is a man, I think the universality of the emotions will speak to any reader.  I highly recommend this book.	2004-05-31

Starring Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as a better sleuth than Sherlock Holmes, this novel takes us into New York City of 1919 for a mystical mystery that is exciting enough that I nearly missed my subway stop reading it.  I can't remember the last time that happened.<br />Doyle becomes the leader of a group of spiritualist crime-fighters including H.P. Lovecraft, Marie Laveau and Harry Houdini when the founder of the Arcanum is killed over a book that may bring about the end of the world.  In trying to solve the murder and recover the book, the members of the Arcanum discover more than they (or we) would ever expect. Or that I would want to give away in a review.<br />Mr. Wheeler clearly has a talent for characterization.  All the members of the Arcanum are wonderfully drawn.  And each of them has moments worthy of their skills.  Houdini's rescue of Lovecraft from the insane asylum, Laveau's encounter with Beltran and Lovecraft's conversations with Crowley are all scenes that will stay with me.<br />Granted, this novel is a flight of pure fantasy and it has its weaknesses.  I didn't get as much of the sense of old New York in this novel as I had hoped.  Also, it reminds me a lot of that X-files episode about the nephalim--Mr. Wheeler's movie &amp; TV pedigree is pretty obvious.  Still, I was willing to forgive a lot because this novel is a heck of a fun ride.	2004-05-30

Using family lines and maps and a good helping of historical figures, he works to give you a sense of a place through time.  He's done this for Salisbury, England in the novel Sarum and for London in the novel of the same name.  Now he's done the same for Dublin in this novel, the first of a proposed two novels on the city.<br />I enjoyed both Sarum and London.  There is much about Rutherford's style I like.  He writes big novels with a huge cast of characters.  He explains things so that you get not only a sense of how the place developed but also how things like language, names and people changed through the centuries.  On top of that, he tells a story with enough intrigue and fun to keep you going.<br />However, it may be that Rutherford's gotten a little too comfortable with what he does or I've read too much of him, but the worst of his tendencies are on display here.  His need to explain history was more obvious than usual in the opening chapters.  Unfortunately, I think the better chapters of this novel are the later ones where the plot of the story seems to come to the fore over history.  And, even though he doesn't let any of the main characters get the comeuppance they deserve, at least he sets-up readable intrigues--the best of the novel if you make it 500 pages in.<br />I think I'm most irritated by the immutability of his families from generation to generation.  Reading Rutherford, you get the sense that he believes there are &quot;good&quot; families and &quot;bad&quot; families whose nature is passed on as much as hair and eye color which Rutherford puts on prominent display.  (In fact, there is even an eye &quot;squint&quot; that gets passed on in this novel.)  In his other novels, families didn't seem so entirely unchanging though the threads are there.<br />Perhaps what I'm missing most is the closure of his previous novels.  This novel ends in the 16th century.  Unlike his previous novels, we have to wait for volume 2 to get up to modern times.  Maybe some of the surprises await us there.  I just hope enough readers are interested in The Princes of Ireland to bother with volume 2.  I like Rutherford enough to give him the benefit of the doubt.

With this look at Manhattan in the time of the Dutch, Mr. Shorto give us a rural glimpse at this most urban of islands.<br />Every schoolchild knows that Manhattan was originally settled by the Dutch and that New York City was originally New Amsterdam.  In fact, that the entire region between the English settlements in Virginia &amp; Massachusetts was New Holland.  And yet, we are also so brought up on the idea of the thirteen original &quot;English&quot; colonies that it is easy to forget the powerful influence the Dutch had on the formation of these American colonies.  By digging into the newly translated records of the Dutch colony, Mr. Shorto is able to open our eyes to more than just a few place names (Harleem becomes Harlem, the &quot;Jonker&quot; becomes Yonkers, etc.) and the bad memory of Peter Stuyvesant.  He shows the lasting cultural influence that the Dutch inroads into the Hudson Valley had on the American nation.<br />It is impossible to relate all of the eye-opening information that Mr. Shorto reveals in this book.  Needless to say, there is a lot here.  I was particularly interested in the story of &quot;the Jonker&quot; Adriaen van der Donck, the young Dutch lawyer whose liberal interpretation of Dutch law helped bring many of the freedoms we now hold dear to the American psyche.  And I loved being able to image this island as a land of villages (both Indian &amp; European) with farms and vast tracks of unspoilt land.  Mr. Shorto is really able to bring this world to life.<br />In brief, if you have any interest at all in the history of Manhattan, you would be foolish to miss this book.  Even someone interested in American history in general will want to read this book, I think.  As Mr. Shorto makes pains to point out, this island was the center of a multicultural community from day one that stretched its melting pot ideals deep into the heart of America.  It is a fascinating story.ut, this island was the center of a multicultural community from day one that stretched its melting pot ideals deep into the heart of America.

Here we find a young, Wall Street-type sucked into a search for an old, missing book by some incredibly wealthy clients.  Though intrinsically valuable, the book is more important in what is hidden in the text and some want it found while others most certainly do not.  Good conflict and good adventure.  And over a book.  What else could a reader want?<br />Also, there are a number of good characters here and Grossman has created a sequence of events that seems as if it really could have happened, even when it veers towards the extreme--I am thinking of MOMUS and its followers here.  This sense of reality is what is missing in a lot of thrillers.  Even though the sense of timing Grossman creates is a little loose, these are people I can believe in who do things that people actually do--nothing too James Bond.  This allowed me to forgive a lot of the expected predictability, though there were a few surprises here.<br />All in all, I was very pleased with this book.  It's not quite The Name of the Rose--but, then, what is?--still, it's a very good read that I would recommend.	2004-05-04

And yet, if we are to find meaning in the lives of the saints so they can help us in our own striving, isn't it important to at least try to find the reality behind the stories?  If it is, then Mr. Freeman has produced something very nice here.<br />If the truth be told, finding the facts about anyone living 1600 years ago is next to an impossible task.  But, surprisingly, we do have a certain number of facts about Patrick: he was born to a relatively well-off family in Britain, was captured and sold as a slave in Ireland where he stayed for six years tending sheep until he escaped back to Britain where he was reunited with his family.  Clearly his captivity opened Patrick's religious spirit and, after spending a number of years training with the Church, he returned to Ireland where he was bishop for the rest of his life doing his utmost to convert the natives.<br />Of course, this brief story is not enough to satisfy the human need for the extraordinary in their heroes--particularly religious ones--so stories quickly built up around Patrick: miracles &amp; snakes &amp; druids.  But Mr. Freeman puts these aside very quickly and focuses only on what we can be relatively certain about with Patrick.  Instead of legend he gives us historical background, quotes from contemporaries, and minimal speculation.  I also enjoyed reading Patrick's two letters in the epilogue which Mr. Freeman quotes extensively in his text.  I hadn't realized Patrick had produced any writings that survived.<br />All in all, this book is an excellent experience.  Brief, certainly, (only 150 pages of original text) but deeply satisfying.  Personally, I am more inspired by a human story than a miraculous one and this is the story that we get here.	2004-05-01

He is a very provocative writer on religious issues and certainly has produced another interesting volume here.  However, I wasn't as pleased with this one as I have been with his previous works.<br />In this book, Mr. Kirsch examines the triumph of monotheism over polytheism in the West beginning in the fourth century AD.  In it, he takes through the period of Emperor Constantine and those that followed him, particularly Julian.  He uses these two men to illustrate the competing factions of Christianity (Constantine) and \\"paganism\\" (Julian).  And, in many ways, he succeeds in making an important point: that, despite what we would like to believe and often put in our histories, the triumph of Judeo-Christian monotheism was by no means easy or assured.  As usual, it is a good point and one worth making.<br />On the other hand, this book has many flaws that I haven't seen in Mr. Kirsch's previous work.  The most notable, and irritating, is the self-contradictory nature of his prose.  He says that Christians were not persecuted that harshly as he goes on to describe a persecution; he says that pagans rarely made bloody sacrifices as he goes on to describe a horrific ritual; he says that sexuality was rarely part of pagan religion as he goes on to describe temple prostitutes.  Though I believe Mr. Kirsch is probably right in his assessment of polytheism and his charges of Christian hyperbole, he didn't make his point very well.<br />Ultimately, there is a theme of comparative tolerance here; namely, that Christianity brought in a tyranny of cruel orthodoxy whereas the pagans were more generally accepting of diversity.  Though this may be true on the face of it, Kirsch hits wide of the mark when he implies that the modern horrors of religious persecution and war would be absent in our modern world had polytheism triumphed.  Certainly \\"religious\\" persecution and war would be less.  But I suspect persecution and war would remain much the same.  In fact, maybe Christianity and Islam have done something to lessen the impact at times.<br />Kirsch tries to save himself when he says in the very last paragraph of the book, \\"The dark side of monotheism, of course, is not its only side.  The blessings of Judaism, Christianity and Islam far outweigh--and, we must hope, will long outlast--the curse of religious fanaticism that is implicit in the very notion of the Only True God.\\"  However, this is merely the largest and last contradiction in a book that has its best and most important points muddled by a mind that seems unsure as to whether he's really willing to make the leap his own work implies.remain much the same.

Probably one of the most important people ever to come from Quincy is Paul W. Tibbets, though it's very likely that even most Quincians wouldn't know his name.  In fact, Col. Tibbets is the man who trained the crews and commanded the mission that dropped the atomic bomb over Hiroshima.  Return of the Enola Gay is Col. Tibbets' story, told in his own words.<br />To be honest, though I very much wanted to like this book, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  Col. Tibbets prose is somewhat unpolished but his folksy, colloquial style is in the classic storytelling tradition and it is very readable.  Reading this book, I often felt like I was sitting at my grandfather's feet, listening to stories of the war.  He may come across as a little arrogant at times (like most of the great soldiers) but Tibbets' stories are always worth hearing.<br />And stories are something that Col. Tibbets has in great supply.  The heart of the story is the organization and training of the squads that will ultimately compose the strike forces dropping \\"fat man\\" and \\"little boy\\" and, certainly, hearing Col. Tibbets describe his experiences on August 6, 1945, is gripping.  However, Col. Tibbets was involved with many other important figures and events of World War II of which I was not even remotely aware.  He trained (and shot skeet) with George Patton before the war.  He piloted the first daylight bombing raids over Nazi occupied Europe.  He flew Eisenhower and other important soldiers crucial to the Allied invasion of North Africa and flew a number of raids there.<br />And even though the stories of war might be enough to make a good book, Col. Tibbets does much more.  He tells us the story of his life--the moving around, military school, leaving medical school to become a pilot, his years after the war and his ultimate retirement from the air force.  He gives us insight into many of the famous and important people he met, like Patton and Doolittle.  He describes how the Nagasaki bombing and the first nuclear test at Bikini atoll were near disasters.  In particular, I was fascinated by his insights into the politics of the military, how certain people earn promotions and assignments.  All in all, it is an absorbing account of an important period of American history told by a man who lived it.<br />A warning:  an anti-war reader looking for an apology for the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will have to look elsewhere.  Col. Tibbets is proud of his role in what he often points out are the attacks that ended World War II, likely saving the lives of millions of Allied and Japanese soldier despite what revisionist \\"historians\\" would like to say.  And, though I am leery of American tendencies to jump into war, I also think that Monday-morning quarterbacking 60 years later is an easy way to get up on a soapbox for people who didn't have to make the hard choices.

US	50946478	R30I4LMIMU80OO	0670894737	141542110	The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History	Books	5	3	5	N	Y	An Excellent Account of Science &amp; History	Perhaps the most famous plague epidemic in history is the Black Plague of fourteenth century Europe.  However, plagues have struck repeatedly throughout history and continue to do so.  In many ways much more devastating than the Black Plague was the influenza outbreak of 1918.  The first truly worldwide plague, it was also the first epidemic of the modern scientific era showing both the strength and weaknesses of modern approaches to dealing with disease.  Sadly, it is also a very neglected event in terms of written history.  Mr. Barry has gone some ways toward filling that gap.<br />I believe the first world war and its aftermath to be the most important historical period of the twentieth century.  The outbreak of &quot;Spanish flu&quot; in the last month of the war were a critical influence on the sequence of events.  Soldiers of every nation were devastated by influenza which had the surprising ability to kill men and women in the prime of life.  One of the odd properties of this outbreak, which the author is clear to point out, was that it was more like to kill in the 18-35 year-old age range whereas typical flu kills only young children and the elderly (still at the rate of more than 36,000 per year in the United States).  And this influenza may have killed as many as 100 million people worldwide (out of a population of 1.6 billion) making it--in pure numbers--the most devastating plague in history.<br />That alone would make this plague an important historical event; however, this influenza may have done more.  Mr. Barry speculates that Woodrow Wilson, when negotiating the Treaty of Versailles, whose terms led to World War II, was influenced to turn his back on his own principles and allow this treaty to be written because he caught influenza which laid him low at the height of negotiations and, though he recovered, may have done more to him that was realized at the time.  The influenza may have affected his memory and set-up the conditions that would lead to his debilitating stoke in a matter of months.  Who says disease cannot change the course of history?<br />This is only one of the surprises Mr. Barry has in store for his reader, even one as familiar with the event as myself.  He describes evidence that makes it very likely this &quot;Spanish flu&quot; had its origins in the United States--Kansas to be precise.  He describes the incredibly poor state of the medical profession in the United States at the turn of the twentieth century and how, led by the inspiration of Europe, a handful of doctors turned American medicine into a science that still was not equipped to handle this emergency though they valiantly tried to do so.  And yet, failures aside, they made great strides towards making the United States the powerhouse of modern science it ultimately became.<br />To his credit, like the best historians of science, Mr. Barry not only gives us the history--tracking the spread, giving the number, analyzing the response--but he also gives us a look into the personalities that helped create and diffuse this situation.  I am always interested in a book that gives an honest look at how the scientific mind works and how science progress because of actual people with various strengths and weaknesses.  True, Mr. Barry is somewhat repetitive but his prose is generally quite readable.  Something that cannot be said of all of his peers.<br />We often like to think that modern science has basically conquered disease and, certainly, there have been great strides made.  On the other hand, the threat of epidemic remains with us--even more so now with the threat of terrorist-generated epidemics.  At some point we will realize that science cannot ever completely eliminate the threat of disease.  How we deal with an emerging disease remains important as we have seen in recent years with things like AIDS, SARS and mad cow disease.  Looking to the past can provide vital clues with how to deal with an outbreak on every level.  Mr. Barryprovides us with a interesting and in-depth look at one of the most important plagues in history.  It is a subject I find endlessly fascinating and this is an account that should be read.provides us with a interesting and in-depth look at one of the most important plagues in history.

Growing up in a small town in the Midwest, I encountered the very occasional mouse but I have no recollections of seeing a rat until I moved to New York City.  Even then, my only encounters have been from a distance on subway tracks.  But I find the rat a fascinating creature.  Clearly, Robert Sullivan does too.<br />A lot has been made of the multitude of facts about rats that Sullivan communicates in this book and does do that but he also does much more.  He gives us a history lesson of rat migrations through history along with quite a few interesting anecdotes about the history of New York City from the days of the Revolution through the fall of the World Trade Center.  Despite his obvious respect for the rat, he blows away numerous myths about the rat (like one rat per person in NYC) and tells a lot about how to &quot;control&quot; rats, as they can never really be exterminated.  However, the real engagement in this book comes from everything being couched in the author's one year field study of the rat in a small alley in downtown New York.  Without this, all of Sullivan's informative research wouldn't be quite so interesting.<br />What we end up with is a very readable book.  I don't consider myself to be afraid of rats though I'm sure if I would put myself in some of the positions Sullivan did, I would feel every bit of a chill running up and down my spine.  Fortunately, we don't have to put ourselves face to face with rats.  Sullivan has done the job for us and written a wonderful account of the experience.  Anyone whose ever had even an inkling of wonder about these tenacious creature wouldn't want to miss this book.	2004-04-13

Though billed as a sequel to The Radetzky March, this novel is considerably different with only a handful of minor characters that overlap the two stories.  It has its pleasures but they are of a different nature.<br />Certain differences leap out right away.  First, this &quot;novel&quot; is considerably shorter than The Radetzky March.  Second, this novel is written in the first person, from the point of view of Franz Ferdinand von Trotta.  Third, the language is considerably more colloquial than the more formal structure Roth used in the previous novel.  Everything contributes to what feels like a more casual experience than The Radetzky March.<br />Still, Roth has a lot to say about the experience of pre- and post-Great War Austrians.  Von Trotta, the narrator of the story, is a pretentious young man hanging out in the coffee shops of Vienna completely unprepared for the experience of war he will soon face.  He sees little fighting, however, as he is captured early and spends the bulk of the war as a prisoner in Russia.  Returning to his wife (with whom he never consummated his marriage) and mother, he finds a world he no longer understands through which he must find his way.<br />I am always fascinated how so many things we only consider &quot;modern&quot; problems crop up in these old stories.  The intriguing lesbianism Trotta's wife engages in during his absence is one example.  The vanity and conning of Trotta's elderly mother is another.  It amazes me how we can read a novel like this and see how little human nature changes over the decades.<br />Though my personal taste leans more towards the formalism of The Radetzky March and its deep examination of the relationships between fathers and sons, there is much to enjoy here.  It certainly has a more modern flavor that will appeal to many readers as some of Roth's other novels may not.  Roth's ability to find truth in character is also on good show here.  I would recommend it highly.novels may not.  Roth's ability to find truth in character is also on good show here.  I would recommend it highly.	2004-04-08

I am a big fan of scientific histories and this is a very good one.  Gribbin takes us through the development of Western science from its roots in the Renaissance through modern threads of research.  His prose is very readable and well organized even as he takes us through the major topics of physics, chemistry and biology.<br />One of the things that makes his book so readable is that he focuses a lot of his energy on the lives and personalities of the great scientists.  Though we get a grounding in the theories, we get more about science as a human pursuit which is often forgotten in our technologically-swamped age.  It is a nice approach through which we not only get to hear about the ones everybody knows--Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Einstein, etc.--but a number of names with which even a science teacher like myself is less familiar.<br />My main problem with this book is that Gribbin's prejudices show through loud and clear.  He is clearly not a supporter of Thomas Kuhn's ideas of scientific revolution which I think have a certain validity and usefulness though Gribbin is correct in that science would progress even without revolutions; however, it would not likely have progressed in the way that Gribbin himself outlines so well.  Gribbin also clearly has some problems with the really famous scientists like Einstein and, in particular, Newton.  I'm not quite clear why Gribbin is so anti-Newton but his assertions that everything discovered by Newton and Einstein would have eventually been discovered by other scientists, while likely true, dismisses the fact that these genius certainly accelerated our understanding.  In addition, in my view, men like Newton, Darwin and Einstein had a capability to see the big picture far beyond that of any of their contemporaries.  They deserve the credit they usually receive and Gribbin's complaints often come off sounding like sour grapes from a less successful scientist.<br />Still, Gribbin makes no secret of his views and no apologies and I can appreciate that.  He has done a great service with this book.  Obviously, with all the ground he has to cover, even at 600+ pages he cannot go into much depth; however, he presents a fascinating story of the men and women who have done so much to shape our modern world.  It is worth reading for any educated person./>Still, Gribbin makes no secret of his views and no apologies and I can appreciate that.  He has done a great service with this book.

And it pretty much lived up to my expectations.<br />Too many photographers of nudes forget how important the facial expression can be.  After awhile you get tired of seeing women with these serious &quot;arty&quot; expressions.  You just want to enjoy the female form and get the impression that the woman being photographed delights in sharing with you.  And though there are serious expressions here, Mr. Einhorn achieves his greatest effects in the relaxed attitudes and the smiles.<br />Though there is very little text in this well-made little volume, I also enjoyed that he gave a brief paragraph before each selection of pictures telling the model's name and a little bit about her.  This increased the relaxed atmosphere of the book for me.<br />If there is a weakness in the book for me, it is a personal one.  I am not very fond of tattoos and many of these women have very prominent and, in some cases, extensive tattooing which ruins the beauty of the form.  Still, this is a small complaint and many of the subjects here--Cara, Christina, Diana, Jen, Julia, Kaiama, Tamara, Thuc (my personal favorite) and Chadia--are astoundingly beautiful; especially when they smile.	2004-03-21

But I recently read an article describing this novel so I decided to give it a try.  I am glad I did because it is one of the best novels I've read recently.<br />The Radetzky March describes the last decades before the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I through the story of a family, the Trotta family.  In following three generations of the Trottas we see their sudden rise to glory when Captain Joseph Trotta becomes the ennobled Hero of Solferino by saving the life of the young Kaiser Franz Joseph, we see their stagnation is the long bureaucratic career of  Franz Trotta and we see the just as sudden end of the Trotta's with the death of Carl Joseph Trotta in a battle near the beginning of the war.  In many ways, this progression is a human mirror for the rise and fall of Austria-Hungary and, for someone like myself who is very interested in World War I, this novel gave great insight into the lead-up to the war.<br />If this novel were just political commentary, however, there would be nothing special about it.  In fact, it is much more.  It is a very human story of fathers &amp; sons in changing times.  After brief backgrounds of the Hero of Solferino and his son, the bulk of the novel follows Carl Joseph's life and career before the war.  In particular, we see how Carl Joseph's relationship to his father leads him down the path that will take him to his death.  And yet, there is great love and respect between the two men.  Some of the most moving passages in the novel are those where Carl Joseph and his father spend time together.  And over both of them hangs the painting of the Hero of Solferino.  Even after his death, Carl Joseph's grandfather holds sway.  Family mold us.<br />This novel is also peppered with well-drawn minor characters including a wonderful chapter that puts us in touch with the aging Emperor Franz Joseph.  And it moves us with fascinating events such as the death of Carl Joseph's first mistress and his encounter with the woman's husband, the death of Carl Joseph's best friend in a foolish duel and an encounter with his father's old, fallen friend when father &amp; son travel to Vienna together.  So much happens here that I cannot begin to describe it all.<br />It is hard to tell what might be lost in translation, but the prose here is very well written and a joy to read.  It is more formal and stylistic than modern prose (the recurrence of the song that gives the book it's title, for example--I wish I was familiar with the tune) but I enjoyed it.  Anyone interested in classic novels or World War I would be foolish to pass this novel up; however, I would also suggest it to anyone who enjoys a good novel of father/son relationships.

I could digress into one of my harangues about how free verse not based in the forms is not poetry; however, I'll resist.  Still, there are some of us who still care deeply about the forms and I am one.  In fact, the sonnet remains my favorite of the forms.  That is why I was happy to see this book and I was not disappointed by it.<br />Baer is another who cares deeply about formal poetry.  As founding editor of The Formalist, probably the most important magazine dedicated to formal poetry, he has done much to help the forms live on.  He also does so through his work.<br />There are a number of good poems in this book.  &quot;Quarantine&quot; is a wonderful, classically flavored sonnet.  The first six lines are declarations of how &quot;he&quot; would fly to the side of his love whether she lived across the city, country or world.  But we then transition to her &quot;across the room in her sleeping gown&quot; where she is &quot;remote,&quot; &quot;a cold, unpassable, infinite distance.&quot;  Yet, he loves her and she must love him somehow despite her coldness: &quot;needing nothing but him in her companionless hell.&quot;  Nice.<br />I wish I had time to explicate more but let me just say that, of Baer's own work, &quot;Balcony,&quot; &quot;Snowflake,&quot; &quot;Monster,&quot; &quot;Pumpkin,&quot; &quot;Crime Scene,&quot; &quot;Swimming Pool,&quot; and &quot;Last Will&quot; are among my favorites.<br />Baer also includes two sections of translations is this book.  Though Baer is clearly a fan of Jorge Luis Borges, neither his couples of poems to Borges or the sequence of translated sonnets did much for me.  On the other hand, I found the sequence of sonnets by Luis de Camoes to be excellent.  Though Camoes clearly had tragedies in his life, the poetry he drew from his suffering is often wonderful.  His sonnet to the Tagus takes me back to Toledo--my favorite Spanish city--and his &quot;Dear Gentle Soul&quot; is very moving.  The peak of Camoes' sonnets, however, is the first, &quot;Curse,&quot; where we get a pure articulation of his despair: &quot;Wipe away, with death, the day of my birth&quot; which lead into a litany of curses should his time return again: &quot;Let monsters be born.  Let blood rain from the sky./Let every mother not recognize her child.&quot;  Powerful stuff!<br />This is by no means a perfect book.  I've already mentioned the Borges material and the Sermons (to Myself) section wasn't particularly impressive, though I did like &quot;Centurion.&quot;  Still, there are more than enough excellent sonnets here to make reading this book worthwhile.  And maybe, just maybe, reading this will inspire a renewed respect for this important form of poetry.sh city--and his &quot;Dear Gentle Soul&quot; is very moving.

Fortunately, I don't have a lot of criticisms to make.  I have been a Collins fan for some time, having come across a poem of his in Poetry magazine and then reading his collection Questions About Angels.  I've been reading his stuff ever since.<br />I've never read a poet who keeps me enthralled on every page and Collins is no exception; however, there is a lot of good stuff here.  &quot;Night Letter to the Reader,&quot; &quot;The Country,&quot; &quot;Velocity,&quot; &quot;Istanbul,&quot; &quot;Love,&quot; &quot;Creatures,&quot; &quot;Birthday,&quot; &quot;Albany,&quot; &quot;Litany,&quot; &quot;Bermuda&quot; and &quot;The Only Day in Existence&quot; are among my favorites.<br />I particularly like a poem called &quot;Tipping Point&quot; where Collins brings out the arbitrariness of measuring time and the subtlety of our sensations of time: &quot;...the sensation you might feel/as you passed through the moment//at the exact center of your life/or as you crossed the equator at night in a boat.&quot;  Would we want to be able to sense the midpoint of our lives?  Could we?  Any more than we could sense passing over the equator?--another arbitrary way to measure our world.  And yet, we do sense things deeply, if only in the deep dark night or while walking in the rain.<br />But Collins never dips to far into pretentiousness.  In fact, in &quot;Study in Orange and White&quot; he illuminates the pretentiousness of titles.  How many of us know that the painting generally referred to as &quot;Whistler's mother&quot; is in fact entitled &quot;Arrangement in Gray and Black&quot;?  Then why not, Collins asks, Botticelli's &quot;Birth of Venus&quot; as &quot;Composition is Blue, Ocher, Green, and Pink&quot; or, best of all: &quot;...a chef being roasted on a blazing spit/before an audience of ducks/and calling it &iexcl;¥Study in Orange and White.'&quot;  I always enjoy a poet who can bring in some humor because I find this to be a weakness in my own poetry.<br />Ultimately, as you read this poetry, you begin to realize that Collins is never far from you.  This is not confessional poetry and yet the pronoun &quot;I&quot; appears in every single poem.  But Collins is more of a friendly guide through his poetry than someone who is trying to beat you over the head with his themes.  Collins has been compared to Frost and I think there is some truth in this.  In this collection, Collins shows his Frost-like skill at presenting poems that are relatively short and very accessible in a surface reading but yield more if you want to put in some effort to dig a little deeper.  This is an uncommon skill.<br />Modern poetry is too often neglected in this country today.  That is too bad.  Here is a collection of poetry that deserves to be read.  In these rather short poems, Collins uses his personality and experiences to give his readers a share of those experiences--experiences that are worthwhile.some humor because I find this to be a weakness in my own poetry.<br />Ultimately, as you read this poetry, you begin to realize that Collins is never far from you.

His movie career continues apace with the occasional hit and he continues to develop as an author.  The Pleasure of My Company is a distinct improvement over his debut story, Shopgirl.<br />Though not noticeably longer, The Pleasure of My Company gets tagged &quot;a novel&quot; whereas Shopgirl was &quot;a novella;&quot; still, I'm willing to forgive since this book has the depth.  Martin has made a wise move by focusing on a single character, Daniel, this time around.  Martin's main talent lies in characterization and wry commentary and Daniel gives him an opportunity to do both.  This streamlines the story and makes it much more interesting.<br />Daniel is a mentally disturbed young man whose ability to leave his apartment is very limited because of his obsessions and phobias--his inability to step off of curbs, for instance, or his obsession with thinking of things in terms of magic squares.  Still, he attempts to reach out to the world around him: entering essay contests, joining MENSA, trying to meet the realtor across the street or the pharmacist at the Rite-Aid.  Eventually, as his obsessions shift and he gets a little luck, his world begins to open up.<br />Admittedly, I'm a little tired of the mentally disturbed protagonist but Daniel is an engaging character mainly because he is basically a nice guy and he struggles to overcome his problems instead of giving into them.  And the observations of the unbalanced often hold more truth than the lives of the &quot;normal.&quot;  Though there is nothing mind-bendingly fantastic here, this brief read is a good one.	2004-02-01

As we read the Songs &amp; Sonnets that head each chapter (and are often interspersed) and we listen to Jasper's speech in the final chapter we fully realize this--something we should have known all along.  Still, it's a very good disguise.<br />What ultimately makes this novel so successful is the character of Jasper, through whom we see the story unfold.  He is the calligrapher of the title, a man currently making his living copying out a selection of Donne's poetry for a rich patron to give as a gift to his girlfriend.  He is also an incredibly smooth womanizer whose thoughts on the subject of how to deal with women are  vivid and honest.  Jasper is one of the most alive characters I have read in awhile.<br />In my mind, Jasper is at his best in the opening chapters of the book when he is unrepentant in his dealings with women.  However, he only loses a bit when he encounters Madeline and we realize love is going to change this man.  And we realize where this story is ultimately going: payback.  Jasper is going to learn lessons about his dissolute life the hard way.  Still, Jasper is so engaging as he goes through his trials that I kept reading and didn't even have to stifle a groan as the &quot;secrets&quot; were revealed in the book's final chapters.  And what serious reader would regret spending some time learning about calligraphy and John Donne in the process of being told such a story?<br />Mr. Docx has written an excellent first novel and shown that he possesses the skills to become a major talent.  If Jasper, Madeline, Lucy, Will and Jasper's grandmother are any indication, his ability to create character is better than most.  I am interested to see who peoples his next creation.	2004-01-31

Even those of us considered readers do not do enough reading of what is current in poetry.  When I come across a poem in a magazine that really moves me, I try to find a book of that author's poetry and read it.  In an issue of Poetry magazine awhile back I read a poem by J. Allyn Rosser called &quot;Meeting on the Street&quot; which I think is fantastic.  That lead me to this book.<br />There is much to like in this book.  I found a number of the poems-- &quot;Square Dance, Fourth Grade,&quot; &quot;Decreator,&quot; &quot;Patience Is a Virtue,&quot; &quot;Rods and R.,&quot; and &quot;Before the Sickness Is Official&quot;--to be very good.  The poem &quot;Realism&quot; is probably the strongest poem here with its clever self-portrait hidden within the description of a friend painting the author's portrait:  &quot;...my willfully/ unwilling stillness...&quot; and &quot;I never smile except when she paints me,/ because I know her flaws, stubborn bitch,/ I know she'll go ahead an paint a smile in./ I figure it may as well be mine.&quot;  Does this tell us more about the author or the painter?<br />Though none of these poems moved me as much as &quot;Meeting on the Street&quot; (which is not contained in this volume, by the way), these poems show Rosser to be a strong poet who is only getting stronger.  If her skills continue to improve, her next volume of poetry should be extraordinary.  Still, this volume is worth reading.	2004-01-15

Of his last three books, I think Being Dead and The Devil's Larder are both incredibly good books.  On the other hand, I was rather disappointed with Quarantine.  Here, I am sorry to say, is another disappointment.<br />Genesis is the story of a man, Felix Dern, who has produced a child with every woman with whom he's ever had sex.  That amounts to six children, if we include the one who is yet a fetus at the top of the novel.  And yet, Lix, as he is called, is a timid man despite his fame as an actor.  How does he manage this?<br />It can't be because of his supposed fertility which appears a non-issue to me despite the fact that Crace keeps coming back to it.  Lix doesn't cause a child every time he has sex (which would have been really interesting.)  And he can't be afraid that every time he has a relationship with a woman he will have a child.  He doesn't even know of his first child and his child with his first love-for-a-month, the fiery Freda, doesn't explain the years of abstinence that follows this break-up.<br />Does his nature come from the repression of this unnamed city in which he lives his life?  It's hard to tell but it seems unlikely since his fame allows him a lot of freedom and travel to America.  If his home is so bad why didn't he just stay in Hollywood?<br />When it comes right down to it, I couldn't fathom Lix at all and this ruined the book for me.  Though Crace has an excellent prose style, the only place where this story really came alive for me was near the end where we got a glimpse at Lix through the eyes of his children.  Perhaps that would have been a better book.	2004-01-15

But not all.  In particular, many of the ones written before 1950 or so still need my attention.  So, periodically, I try to pick up one I haven't read and give it a go.  Having just finished reading Simon Winchester's Krakatoa, where he gives such a glowing report of this book, I pulled it down from the shelf.<br />This is a fun book.  It tells the story of a retired math teacher, William Waterman Sherman, who builds a balloon to help him get away from it all by spending a year floating through the skies.  Instead, he quickly finds himself downed on the island of Krakatoa where he finds a secret colony of people living quite comfortably.  He joins them.  Unfortunately, in a couple days, Krakatoa erupts, destroying the island almost completely.  Fortunately, the colony had prepared for the chance of eruption and everyone is saved.<br />Published in 1947, this book is filled with a little interesting science and a lot of fantasy.  If it has a weakness, it is that this book feels a little more dated than some of the other older Newbery winners.  It doesn't feel dated because of its content, however, just its prose style.  Its a little formal and relates a post-Victorian view of the world which many young people probably will not understand very well.<br />Still, I enjoyed this story and the drawings by Mr. DuBois very much.  When it comes right down to it, you can hardly go wrong with a Newbery winner.  Still one of the best signs of excellence in the world of fiction--for children or no.	2004-01-15

Though none of the subsequent books in what has become &quot;The Hinges of History&quot; series have equaled the first one, Cahill continues to write very readable accounts of the development of Western civilization.  This book, subtitled &quot;Why the Greeks Matter,&quot; is, as you might suspect, a sketch of the contributions of the ancient Greeks to our culture from Homer through the influence of Greek though on early Christianity.<br />I have a soft spot for Greek culture so I was easily won over by this book.  Though there is some value to the trend of multiculturalism that has permeated American schools in recent decades, I believe strongly that no culture has had more impact on modern Western civilization than the Greeks and we ignore them at our peril.  In examining the strengths and weaknesses of the Greeks, we can see an image of our own strengths and weaknesses.<br />I was a little disappointed to find very little discussion of the Greek development of mathematics (beyond a brief discussion of Pythagoras, focusing mainly on his philosophy).  Greek formalization of mathematics may be their most important legacy to us, ultimately leading to modern science.  Instead, Cahill focuses mainly on literature, art, philosophy and politics and, in these areas, offers a nice history.<br />Clearly, Cahill is knowledgeable and his prose is very readable despite his tendency to quote extensively in this book.  He doesn't offer us many unique or challenging insights but he does remind us of the great contributions of Greek culture.  It is a valuable thing to do.	2004-01-05

I very much enjoyed his book on the birth of modern geology, The Map that Changed the World.  Equally excellent is this book on the eruption of Krakatoa.<br />Subtitled &quot;The Day the World Exploded, August 27, 1888,&quot; this book tells the story of one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history.  This devastating eruption killed nearly 40,000 people and its effects were recorded worldwide.  Not only were its seismic effects felt around the world but also its effects on air pressure were recorded by barometers everywhere in the immediate aftermath of the explosion with tidal effects measured nearly half-way around the world.  In the long term, dust thrown up into the atmosphere altered climate and caused the dramatic atmospheric effects (particularly noticeable around sunset) noticed by artists and scientists for years afterward.<br />The excellence of this book does not lie entirely in its description of the eruption and its aftermath, however.  In fact, the eruption doesn't occur until 209 pages in.  Winchester's excellence comes in his ability to provide interesting context for the tale he is telling.  Along the way to the eruption we learn of the colonial pursuits of Western powers in Indonesia, the beginnings of the &quot;global village&quot; in the expansion of telegraph usage, the development of the theory of plate tectonics to explain volcanism and much, much more.<br />Less compelling, though interesting, is his use of the eruption of Krakatoa as a leaping off point for a discussion of the rise of radical Islam in Indonesia late in the book.  He does make some valid points but they felt a little out of place here.  Or maybe I'm just tired of the recent trend towards everyone trying to make sense of senseless fundamentalism.<br />His science and history, on the other hand, are first rate.  And his closing chapter on the new volcanic island rising over the ashes of Krakatoa is fascinating.  This is an excellent read.f senseless fundamentalism.<br />His science and history, on the other hand, are first rate.

Everyone who falls in love with a book likes to imagine how the story continues after the author decides to leave it.  A writer who challenges a reader's imagination does so at his own risk.  Failures are legion.  But that is just what Louis Bayard has decided to do with Mr. Timothy, a novel based on characters from Dickens' A Christmas Carol.<br />As the title suggests, the story focuses on Tiny Tim Cratchit, now grown-up and healthy except for occasional twinges in the leg and a slight limp.  Despite the support of the still living and reformed Scrooge, Tim is cast adrift upon the death of his father, Bob, and has thrown his lot in with a group of prostitutes where he earns his room &amp; board by teaching the madam to read and write.  While there, he becomes entangled with a young, troubled girl.  In the process of trying to save the girl he discovers a ring of slavery and murder.<br />It's quite a plot!--not original but deftly handled and interesting mainly because of the risks he takes with character.  Here are characters we know--the Cratchits, Scrooge--who Bayard has made his own without losing touch with the foundations Dickens has laid.  Despite the happy ending we might have imagined at the end of A Christmas Carol, Bayard has not hesitated handing around death, weakness and despair to the Cratchits along with strength and goodness.  He is not catering to his readers but challenging them, particularly rabid Dickens fans like myself, and he succeeds.  Whatever I ultimately felt about the plot, I totally believed that this is what could have become of the Cratchits.  Because of that, I enjoyed this novel immensely.<br />And Bayard has added a cast of new characters almost Dickensian in scope and many--Gully, Colin, Philomela, and a host of others--just as memorable.  Intertwining these characters and their stories with reminiscences of how the Cratchits got from Dickens to now, Bayard has created a powerful piece of fiction.  Having no knowledge of Bayard's other work, I had no idea what to expect from him but I am very pleased with the result and I think any reader, Dickens fan or not, will find a good read here.d has created a powerful piece of fiction.

I cannot think of a movie I've seen in the past few years that is as eerie.  Because of this, I wanted to see Ringu, the Japanese movie the American movie is based on and read this book, which started the whole process.  I have to admit, however, that I was disappointed.<br />Though I am usually a fan of linear storytelling, I was engaged by the American movie's visual power and near surrealism in spots.  Unfortunately, that was clearly an invention.  Suzuki's book and the Japanese movie were both very neat packages with the book being the neatest of all.  There was little mystery and when I finished the novel, I felt I understood everything that had happened.  And I felt a loss.<br />I also was disappointed by the prose.  It's difficult to blame Suzuki for this because, not being able to read Japanese, I don't know what's been lost in translation.  But the way we have been given this story in English is very bland, offering little in the way of fear or excitement.<br />Still, I'm glad I read it.  It is interesting to see how the story developed from novel to Ringu to The Ring.  The fundamental piece is there--the video that kills viewers after seven days--but much is developed and changed before the final form.  And I do feel reading this novel has deepened my understanding of The Ring.  For that I am grateful.  But only a real fan of the American movie will find much in this book.	2003-12-17

It is amazing that two people can look so alike.  And we can only imagine that there is a closeness there that most of us never experience in our lives.<br />Though a picture may not be able to get inside someone's mind, it can sure come close with the right artist and Mary Ellen Mark has an ability to see inside her subjects that is nearly unequaled.  And that may be why I find these pictures of twins so compelling.  Looking at these twins you cannot help but notice the similarities at first glance.  And Mark's poses encourage this: symmetries and mirror images.  But this is just a trick that lets her camera look beyond.  The more you look the more the differences--wisps of hair, injuries old &amp; new, the twist in a smile--jump out and are moving.<br />I am a big fan of photographic portraiture and Mark is an expert in the genre.  In twins she has chosen a theme that plays to her strengths.  I would encourage everyone who loves photography to take a look at her work.  And once you've studied these pictures to your heart's content, take some time to peruse the excerpts from the subject interviews at the end of the book.  It adds another dimension to what you've seen.  All in all, this is a book to add to your art book collection.	2003-12-08

But the ability to truly recreate a moment in time as it might have been is rare.  In his previous book, Fatherland, Harris showed his ability to create historical fantasy.  Now, he is warmed-up and wants to show that he can create historical fiction.  And that is exactly what he does.<br />In Pompeii Harris recreates the days before the eruption of 79 AD that destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.  He does this by telling the story of Marcus Attilius Primus, an engineer who takes over the Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct that brings water to the area around Vesuvius, when the previous engineer disappears.  As he deals with maintaining the aqueduct and learning the politics of leadership, Attilius comes face to face with the earth's--and human's--warning that will lead to the eruption and what follows.<br />There are many things I like about this book.  First, despite the fact that we know exactly what's going to happen big picture here (Vesuvius is going to erupt), Harris is able to keep us interested and excited.  Second, we get a feeling that, although we know this is fiction, this is something that could have happened.  It is not pure fantasy in an historical setting.  Finally, Harris has the ability to create characters that we care about.<br />Admittedly, Harris has chosen a subject in which I am very interested.  The eruption of Vesuvius has long fascinated me and a few years ago I traveled to Italy to tour the ruins of Pompeii.  It was very fun for me to read this book and get a feeling for what that time was like.  This novel hit no false notes with me.  If anything, I wish Harris had been willing to carry the novel past the eruption farther into the aftermath.  That said, I think anyone who enjoys historical fiction will find a lot to like here.	2003-12-08

If nothing else, the sheer number of books about him and the scientific revolution that have been published recently attest to this.  (My favorite among these being Galileo's Daughter by Dava Sobel.)  Mr. Roland has made a solid addition to this collection.<br />Mr. Roland's main theme is the correction of what he considers a misunderstanding of the real conflict between the Church and Galileo.  Whereas most people seem to believe that it was Galileo's support of the Copernican heliocentric theory of the solar system that got him into trouble, Roland points out that this was secondary.  His true conflict came because of his insistence that the scientific method was the only way to truth.  Clearly this is something that the Church could not and cannot tolerate.<br />Along the way we are treated to a nice history of the early years of scientific method as well as an outline of Galileo's career and achievements.  Unfortunately, we are also made to endure Rowland's emulation of Galileo's method of prose.  In between chapters of excellent history and commentary we have a basically irritating dialogue between the author as narrator and what I assume are the fictional characters of Sr. Maria Celeste and Berkowitz, who hold the positions of the Church and science, respectively.  Of course, in a reversal of Galileo, the nun gets the best of the argument every time.<br />And it's not that I don't like what Rowland has to say.  I agree with his thesis.  I may not feel it's been overlooked as much as he does but I certainly think his reminder of Galileo's weaknesses as both scientist and writer is timely and worthwhile, though I don't dismiss Galileo's achievements as Rowland is often wont to.  It's just that I don't feel much is achieved by effectively silencing the other party instead of presenting a truly reasoned discussion.  Certainly Galileo could be hamfisted in his prose and we are used to the kind of virtual ad hominem approach to argument that passes as debate in everything today, but I still don't like it.  A very good book would have been much better without it.<br />Still, I'm not willing to throw out the baby with the bathwater here.  With the impact--and often, admittedly, negative impact--that science has had on our world it is perhaps no surprise that we look back to the founders and foundation of modern science for answers.  Though he doesn't provide perfect insight or perfectly readable prose, Rowland has certainly made a fair addition to our look backward at this most important of periods.

Whereas in his previous book Winchester basically focused on a single relationship in the construction of this great dictionary, here he gives us the broad view of the story, from its conception by a group of philologists to its completion nearly 70 years later.  This is a marvelous book.<br />Of course, Winchester gives us the story of the &quot;great men&quot; whose vision and hard work brought this great dictionary into being--Herbert Coleridge, grandson of the famous poet; Frederick Furnivall, whose lust for life nearly buried the project; James Murray, who dedicated the better part of his life to its completion--but he also gives us much more.  He brings these men to life.  He brings the world which made such men to life as well.  It is an eminently readable tale.<br />And, beginning and end, Winchester gives us the precursors of the dictionary--Johnson &amp; Webster--as well as a taste of its impact on our world.  I cannot imagine that anyone with a love of words or reading would pass up an opportunity to read this book.	2003-11-23

But, as any reader of Irving Stone's The Agony and the Ecstasy would know, Michelangelo considered himself a sculptor above all else and had no desire to paint this ceiling.  In fact, as King makes clear in this book, Michelangelo only consented to Pope Julius II's command to paint the ceiling as a stepping stone to get back to the project he really desired--the sculpting of the figures for Julius's tomb.  And, even then, it was often touch and go as to whether Michelangelo would finish the fresco.<br />Michelangelo's artistic achievements were great, wide and varied but by focusing on this single, famous project that occupied better than three years of the artist's life King is able to give us a living portrait of this genius.  We get to see his petulance and penny-pinching as well as his fantastic work.  We get to see his fights with family, assistants and pope as well as his tireless work to better his family and amaze his observers.  We get to see a man more like us with his cares and worries as well as his triumphs.  It is a worthwhile endeavor.<br />King also makes a point to dispel some of the legends that have grown up around Michelangelo and his painting of the ceiling.  We lose the image of a single man lying on his back, covered in paint; replaced by a man leading a team of assistants of varying competence standing with tilted head to paint above him.  We lose the image of a work created as a single outpouring of genius; replaced by a man who made mistakes and tried to fix them, who learned from as well as inspired other artists and whose work improved as he worked and mastered the skills of fresco.<br />Personally, I am a more of a fan of Michelangelo's sculpture than his painting; however, I have been lucky enough to go to the Sistine Chapel and see this most amazing of frescoes.  It truly is a work of art unequaled in its technique.  It is very interesting to get a close-up picture of how it was created.  King has given us that and, though there was much more to Michelangelo's life and work than you will get here, it is worthwhile to read.get a close-up picture of how it was created.

I appreciate a well- and uniquely-constructed book.  They are works of art themselves.  However, it's all meaningless without the words inside.<br />Fortunately, Shrady has written a volume worth reading.  As a physics teacher, I often have cause to tell the story of Galileo and his motion experiments at the Leaning Tower.  (Despite the fact that these experiments are likely the stuff of fiction and legend.)  Shrady discusses these experiments in history of the tower.<br />More interestingly, however, he describes the construction of the tower and the fact that it tilted almost from the start of its construction as did many contemporary structures.  Medieval architecture just wasn't up to the task of predicting in advance what buildings were capable of being effectively constructed.  He also discusses the many fascinating attempts to fix the tower which, more often than not, did nothing or made things worse.<br />Finally, we get the story of the modern attempt in the 1990's to fix the tower which has been, as far as can be determined successful--in angle of tilt has been reduced and seems to be fixed in place.  The tower is once again open to tourists after having been closed for nearly a decade.  All in all it is a fascinating story.<br />If there is a weakness in this book it is the fact that Shrady has fallen into a common trap:  this story (as he told it) didn't quite come up long enough so there's a bit of repetition here to try to bulk things up.  And it still ends up being a slim volume.  Still, it's worth the couple hours time it take to read it.	2003-10-13

Clearly, Ms. Lords has led a tragic life of neglect and abuse and, more importantly, has managed to triumph over it.  She seems to have reached a place in her life and career where happiness is coming to her.  And she deserves it.  And I wanted to cheer for her.<br />The problem is, her writing is just not very good.  At times overwrought and flowery and at others vague to the point where I wasn't sure what was happening, her prose just wasn't equal to her own story.  Her writing didn't allow me to feel the things I wanted to feel--I couldn't share her rage at the people who had done her wrong or her joys at her successes.  At times, I couldn't even feel sympathy for her or interest in what was happening.<br />Normally, I believe strongly in people telling their own story.  In this case, however, Ms. Lords might have been better served by a ghostwriter.  She at least deserved a better editor who could have helped her control some of her poorer tendencies as a writer.  The book does improve as it goes on but I'm afraid most people won't make it that far.  That's too bad because there is a life here worth reading about.	2003-10-13

Filled with a number of moving characters, this novel attempts to show us how the intricacies of family and loyalty are strained by the events and lasting scars of persecution and war.  In this, it succeeds very well.  In other ways, however, it succeeds less well.<br />As a creator of character, Mr. Brodrick shows himself to be quite skilled.  I found most of his characters to be emotionally engaging and interesting.  His plot, on the other hand, seemed to rely more on coincidence than on real surprise and he doesn't manipulate coincidence quite on the level of a Dickens or Irving.  This is not a true mystery or thriller.<br />Clearly, it is based on Brodrick's own experience and that power remains with it.  I wonder what Brodrick has left to bring to his next novel.  Perhaps being less trapped by his own history he will construct a better one.  Still, if a reader looking more for an exploration of emotion than a perfect plot, this is a novel worth reading.	2003-10-07

I already know the reaction this review will get.  If you are liberal, you will love this book.  If you are conservative, you will hate this book.  So, if you are either of these, please don't bother to read any further.  I write this to those of us who are moderate.  To those, I say, this is a book worth reading.<br />Political propaganda has always been vicious and full of lies.  This is nothing new though many of us like to act like this is part of the current fall of the Western world.  For myself, I like to be aware of the lies on both sides.  That is why I enjoy a book like Franken's.  He points out lies both subtle and egregious.  And he does it with a calm and humor that I enjoy.  And he wears his liberal bent right there out on his sleeve.  He's not trying to convince us he's something he's not--like a &quot;compassionate conservative.&quot;<br />Though I follow politics and I always vote in major elections, I have to admit that I'm not passionate about politics.  I've gotten along well enough with both Republican and Democratic administrations of the past 20 or so years.  I also have to admit that I wasn't happy about &quot;Indecision 2000&quot; and the subsequent administration.  Perhaps that's why I'm more interested in Franken's work these days.  Though I've always appreciated his ability to point out the cynicism in people like Limbaugh.<br />When it comes down to it, however, the thing I liked most about this book was the &quot;Team Franken&quot; acknowledgments at the end.  I really like a guy who admits he has help on a project like this and puts their pictures right out there with his.<br />I won't fool myself into thinking I've swayed anyone with this review.  Liberals and conservatives alike will probably revile it and, of course, myself.  (Despite the fact they know nothing about me, really.)  But, if you've made it this far and are still in a calm state of mind, I would suggest you read this book.

What we get in this novel are two narratives: one in the present as Hollis tries to fit in with Josie, an older woman slowing succumbing to dementia; and one in the form of flashbacks told through description of pictures Hollis has drawn which tells the story of the previous summer when Hollis thought she had finally found a home.  Slowly, these two stories are drawn together as Hollis tries to protect herself and Josie as well as come to terms with the events of the previous summer.<br />All in all, Ms. Giff has written a wonderful novel.  The switching between the two plots in handled well and Hollis is a beautifully drawn character.  She is difficult and introverted, but she is an artist and is ultimately able to overcome her defensiveness and become part of a family--even an extended family.  I would highly recommend this novel to young and old alike.	2003-08-29

I always make it a point to read a few first novels every year.  Rarely do you find a gem but often you find writers with real talent that you hope will grow.  Newman is a talent.<br />I have some problems with this novel; mainly, I'm not into clever technique nearly as much as I'm into a really well written story.  I could have done without the variations in prose and shifting plot threads.  On the other hand, Newman creates some very compelling characters in Chrysalis, Ralph and Denise.  And the story, once you've pieced it together in your mind, has some very interesting aspects though her use of coincidence and relationship is not on the level of Dickens.<br />Still, this is a novel that moves along nicely and is easy to read.  In a situation like this, I'm more anxious to see what Newman comes up with next as opposed to reading this novel again.  But that doesn't mean this novel isn't worth a look.	2003-08-29

In particular, I love portraiture, which is probably why I like photographers like Jock Sturges and Mary Ellen Mark who excel at this.  They are invariably able to find interesting subjects and to photograph them in unique and beautiful ways.  I am also fond of the black and white format usually used by Sturges and Mark which keeps the focus on the figures themselves as opposed to something garish they are wearing or the color of their surroundings.<br />With the photographs in Radiant Identities Sturges seems to be experimenting.  Many of my favorite themes in Sturges' work are here.  He has \\"family groups\\"--sisters, brothers, parents & children.  My favorites of these are the \\"generational\\" pictures:  where we see a child and an adult who mirror each other as if we are seeing the future of the child.  But there are also some pictures here that have no similarity with any of his other work.  There are surprises.<br />Of course, Sturges photographs mainly nudes and is probably best known for the controversy surrounding his nude photographs of young girls.  There is no denying the erotic power of some of his pictures but Sturges is no pornographer.  He is able to capture so much more.  The arrangement of the figures tells us something (as in the \\"generational\\" pictures) and I am often surprised at how drawn I am to the eyes of his models and to the careful arrangement of the hair.  He is an artist of uncommon skill and I would highly recommend this book.	2003-08-14

It is a typical first novel.  It has a clever enough plot and interesting enough characters but it falls into many of the traps that I see in first novels.<br />Mainly, this novel is too clever for its own good.  I see this in two main things: first, Mr. Conn clearly has a wide-ranging intelligence but it takes an expert to integrate concepts from the details of pornography, the depths of Shakespeare, Joyce and Nietzsche and the subtleties of cutting edge physics.  He doesn't quite pull it off.  Second, I find Mr. Conn's variations of prose style as the book progresses to add little to the experience of the book and a bit pretentious.  Normal prose, flashback, multiple headings, screenplay format, stream-of-consciousness--it's too much.<br />On a personal note, I don't consider myself a prude but I could have done without some of the more \\"vivid\\" details of the porn industry.  I, like most guys, like a little prurient detail but after awhile it becomes a little much.  And Finn may be a prodigy but she's still only ten-years-old.  Of the many interesting characters in this novel, she was the only one I found that tested the edges of believability.<br />Still, there's a lot of good stuff here.  I love the descriptive detail of Ithaca and New York City, in particular.  I look forward to seeing Mr. Conn's next outing.  I think there's potential here.	2003-07-20

Ms. Paterson has written a number of novels (Bridge to Terabithia, Jacob Have I Loved, Lyddie, etc.) that are among the best I've every read.  This novel may not reach the heights of some of her previous books but it is still a worthwhile read.<br />I have probably shed more tears over Katherine Paterson novels than any other writer except, perhaps, Dickens.  They both have an incredible ability to create realistic characters that you can really feel for as well as a deep perception for the effect that death and abandonment can have on people.  As I began reading The Same Stuff As Stars I didn't think this novel would have the same effect but I must admit that it did. In the character of Angel, continually abandoned by everyone around her but still a strong girl, Paterson has done it again.<br />It is her ability to create these realistic characters, however, that also turned me off to this book.  I found the characters of Verna and, in particular, Bernie to be so unpleasant that the first half of this novel was nearly unreadable for me.  Once these two characters disappear from the novel, I liked the book to be much better.<br />But is it really fair to dislike a book because the characters are created too well?  It's a personal assessment but a fair one, I think.  But this book still has many things to recommend it, not the least of which is the astronomy motif which appeals to me very much as a math and physics teacher.  Another personal assessment, perhaps, but it works both ways.  Ultimately, this is a book that still rates better than just about anything out there.  I would highly recommend it.	2003-07-20

I've never lost my interest for this period of English history.  Over the years my interest has expanded, though, into readings on King John, Robin Hood and Magna Carta as well as the parents of the brood--Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine.  There are many good books on these characters, both fact and fiction, and this book by Richard Barber is an excellent example of the former.<br />What Barber has done is create a brief overview of the lives of Henry II and his many sons.  With the main body of the text coming in at around 160 pages interspersed with pictures and maps, this book only hits the highlights but it is easy and enjoyable to read.  Barber is also able to maintain a balanced approach even when discussing some of the more volatile events such as the murder of Becket and the creation of Magna Carta.<br />Despite its brevity, Barber is able to create a very whole picture of these years of Angevin rule.  Anyone looking for a good introduction to a fascinating period of history would be hard pressed to find a better book.	2003-07-13

The first major part I ever acted in a play was in The Glass Menagerie.  The largest city near my hometown when I was growing up was St. Louis.  So I have a close connection to Tennessee Williams and I admire him very much as a playwright but I had never read these short plays of his until now.  There are some wonderful things here.<br />Nearly all the plays here are quite interesting, my favorites of these play being the simplest ones where two or three characters are having conversations: &quot;Talk To Me Like the Rain and Let Me Listen...,&quot; &quot;This Property is Condemned,&quot; &quot;Auto-Da-Fe&quot; and &quot;Something Unspoken.&quot;  Slightly more complex but still plays with depth and interest are the title play (&quot;27 Wagons Full of Cotton&quot;),  &quot;The Lady of Larkspur Lotion,&quot; &quot;Portrait of a Madonna&quot; and &quot;The Strangest Kind of Romance.&quot;<br />If there is a problems with some of these plays, it is the difficulty in staging them; certainly with the kind of detail that Williams specifies in the stage directions.  Many of the theatre companies I work with simply do not have the resources to create the kind of wonderful images Williams describes.  I loved reading &quot;The Purification&quot;--a lovely verse play--but I thought it incredibly difficult to stage, which is too bad.<br />Even if you aren't considering staging the plays, however, they are worth reading.  It is easy to see from these early plays how Williams was developing the ideas that would become some of his greatest characters, particularly Blanche from Streetcar.  If you have any interest in Williams as a playwright, this is a book that should definitely be read.	2003-07-11

Einstein is who he is and deserves every accolade put upon him but, in my opinion, humankind has never produced a scientific genius as great as Newton.  He understood the world in a way that has never been equaled before or since.<br />That being said, let me also say that this is a very good biography of Newton.  It is brief so it is easily digestible by anyone.  Still, what is lacks in depth it makes up for in coverage.  We get glimpses of many parts of Newton's life, from his obsessive questioning and scientific investigation of the plague/fire years through his hiding-in-plain-sight years at Trinity through the renown of his London years as President of the Royal Society and Warden of the Mint.<br />Gleick also does not shy away from the less understandable parts of Newton's nature--his hypersensitivity to criticism, his theological struggles and his relentless alchemical investigations.  Though, as this biography makes clear, even his ability to achieve his well-known and -respected triumphs in mathematics and physics really defy understanding.  Let's face it, there is something about genius that is beyond any kind of clarity for those of us not touched by it.<br />Anyone interested in a quick look at an amazing man should read this book.  I would also suggest taking the time to follow the many endnotes that Gleick has provided.  Unlike many notes of this type, these are very readable and add to the text, though some probably could have been added right to the body of the text without much interruption of the flow.  In any case, Gleick has written a fine book about a true genius.	2003-07-09
US	50946478	RHY3C3RIEFTBH	0375505296	518214282	The Dante Club: A Novel	Books	5	7	8	N	N	A Literary Thriller	There are few things better than a thriller that's more than a thriller and Matthew Pearl has written just such a book.  By combining well-written characters with a mystery based on Dante's Inferno, Pearl has written a novel that will appeal even to readers who wouldn't normally take a serious look at what is, at its heart, the story of a serial killer.<br />The setting of this novel is Boston in the days after the end of the Civil War.  Pearl does an excellent job of capturing the feel of the era.  He is also very good giving us a sense of his characters, despite (or maybe because of) the fact that many are well-know personages of the time.  In particular, I found Oliver Wendell Holmes and James Russell Lowell to be quite engaging.  But, in fact, every character in the story seems to have a memorable moment or two except, oddly, the central figure of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.<br />The plot centers around a series of gruesome murders happening around Boston.  It doesn't take long before a group of writers--Longfellow, Holmes, Lowell, etc.--realize that these murders are the image of the punishments suffered by the inmates of Dante's Inferno.  They realize this because they are in the process of producing the first English translation of the work.  This is a process that is being fought by many important people so these poets decide to solve the mystery themselves instead of going to the police--and therein lies much of the interest of this novel.<br />To be frank, as a teacher myself I found the bickering between the administrators of Harvard (who are very against this translation) and this group of professors to be part of what makes this novel work for me.  Pearl easily captures the kind of infighting that goes on in schools from Harvard to the worst-performing public school.  It brought in that touch of realism that I enjoy in a novel like this that often has such extreme moments.  And in the basic intellectual freedom of the 21st century America we often forget how things like religion (in this case, Catholicism vs. Protestantism) can affect something like the translation of a book.  We also forget the vitriol that some people had over the loss of the classical languages and the rise of the modern languages.  I found the integration of all this to be quite interesting.<br />By the way, it should be said that the reader does not have to be an expert on Dante to enjoy this novel.  Pearl gives us everything we need to follow what is going on.  And he certainly makes Dante vivid for us.  I had read The Divine Comedy before (though not in Longfellow's translation) but I was inspired to go back and take a look at it again on reading this.  With luck, this novel will encourage other readers to take a look at some of the classics.<br />In the end, Pearl is able to keep the surprises coming up to the end of the book--always a difficult thing to do.  I do wonder, however, what he intends to do as an encore.  This novel came from his own expertise on Dante.  I hope he hasn't used up everything on this one book.  He has talent that I hope he intends to develop because he still has places to go.

I enjoyed this novel so much--more than I expected to--that I was disappointed that I didn't have all the background.<br />Seriously, what's not to like about this book?--a smart and engaging main character surrounded by a cast of equally engaging friends and enemies; secret societies and the secret lives of historical figures like Newton and Victor Hugo; a plot pushed forward by decipherable clues as simple as anagrams and as complex as the hidden meaning of Da Vinci art; the meaning of religious &quot;artifacts&quot; like the Holy Grail; the meaning of religion itself.  It all makes for an irresistible combination.  And Brown, though not perhaps the most adept prose stylist, does a good job of getting us through the twists and turns in an enjoyable fashion.<br />Of course, comfortable in my catholicism, I enjoy speculative novels like this.  I can wonder about the truth of religion without feeling my religion or myself is being attacked.  Plus, my reading has made me familiar already with many of the arguments Brown makes.  But if you are the type of person who is uncomfortable with writing that brings into question some of the basic tenets of Christianity, stay away from this novel.  You will not enjoy it.  But if you want a thrilling ride that also will make you stop and think about some things you thought you knew, this is a book to be read.	2003-07-07

As time goes on, however, Zinkoff's love of school (despite his rather limited abilities) and, in particular, poor performance at sports makes him an outcast.<br />It should be understood that this novel is basically an interesting character study of a single character--Zinkoff.  Despite the rather dramatic wandering in the snowstorm near the end of the book, there is not a lot of action beyond the ordinary day-to-day events in the life of a young man.  But this is one of the things that gives this book its charm.  That, and Zinkoff's own obliviousness to his social status.  It is nice to see a character who basically likes himself.<br />On the other hand, this is a clue to the novel's weakness.  This is basically a very sophisticated story about a boy who has social problems as well as real problems that are only hinted at.  As an adult, I found it very true and interesting but it works on a level higher than a lot of younger readers might be capable of reaching.  Teenage readers might get a lot from this novel but will they read a story about a grade-schooler?  I am afraid this novel will have a tough time finding an audience which is too bad because it is well worth reading.	2003-06-18

I was reading an article some time ago that mentioned this novel as a precursor to George Orwell's 1984.  Well, as 1984 is one of my favorite novels, I thought I should take a look at this one.  Boy, am I glad I did.  This is one fantastic book.<br />In a world where no one has a name, this is the journal of D-503.  He is a man who lives in a city entirely made of glass (since who would have anything to hide from the state?).  He may only pull down his shades if he has the proper coupon (such as a permitted tryst with O-90).  He must take his daily constitutional walk with the rest of the city and watch the films supplied by the state.<br />But D-503 is a man who believes in reason and the correctness of the state.  He chews his food the suggested number of times before he swallows.  He lives his life by the routine given to him by the state.  He works to build the Integral, the first rocket ship to take reason to the stars.  All seems perfect...until he meets I-330.<br />I-330 shows him the power of desire and soon independent thought takes over his mind.  He learns of a more primitive world that exists outside the glass walls of the city.  He even begins to believe he should participate in the revolution against the state.<br />And how does it all end?  Well, I don't want to give too much away.  Besides, there's so much more than I've even hinted at here.  Do yourself a favor and read this book for yourself.	2003-06-01

When teaching Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion, I always make sure to talk about the contributions of Tycho Brahe.  To my mind, the relationship between Brahe and Kepler is one of the earliest examples of the experimentalist/theorist relationship and, unfortunately, it is the experimentalist who is often lost to history while the theorist is remembered.  I teach my students the names of both Brahe and Kepler as a small effort to rectify this unfairness.  Kitty Ferguson has made a larger effort with this book and I hope she is able to reach a large readership.<br />Ms. Ferguson has at least given herself a chance by writing a very good book.  Her prose is very engaging.  She is detailed both science and biography and yet she is quite easy to understand even for those without a scientific background.  And she has two extraordinarily interesting characters to talk about--Brahe, the rather spoiled Danish aristocrat who brought glory to himself against the odds in a &quot;ignoble&quot; profession by becoming the greatest naked eye astronomer in history, and Kepler, the poor German Protestant school teacher who had a knack for doing mathematics and finding trouble.<br />Though I knew the broad outline of Brahe and Kepler's story, I was surprised again and again by all I did not know.  I may not be able to incorporate it all into my classes but I am glad to know the story myself.  It is always interesting to see how the great ideas came into being, mostly through more fits, starts and mistakes than most people realize.  Anyone interested in scientific history would be foolish to pass up reading this book.	2003-05-26

But, every once in awhile everyone wants a good mystery/thriller.  And this is a good one.<br />All I really ask of a book like this is that it offer some suspense.  I am not someone who is easily fooled.  I am well-known among my friends as being able to predict the ends of books and movies.  But I have to admit that Martin does a good job of keeping key elements of the story just out of reach.<br />But what raises this story above the typical is character.  Detective Terry Camel is a fascinating, well-drawn person.  He is known as the \\"human lie detector\\" but is it really a gift or is he faking or just burned out?  And if he can find out the truth, how does he use this information and to whom does he reveal it?  For a great detective, he seems more human than the type usually found in these novels.<br />Combine Camel with a good cast of supporting characters and a grizzly enough crime and you've got a entertaining read.	2003-05-26

Most books about the plague tend to focus on this period.  But Marriott's book reminds us that the plague is not gone, still popping up its ugly head from time to time.<br />In a world chilled by thoughts of bio-terrorism and SARS, most people tend to avoid books like this but I find them interesting.  Humans will always be susceptible to disease but we will always fight back.  In this book, Marriott tells the parallel stories of an outbreak of plague in southeast Asia in 1894 where two scientists--Alexandre Yersin and Shibasaburo Kitasato--tried to determine the process of this disease and an outbreak of plague in India in 1994 where he shows how panic still dominates our reactions to epidemics in our modern world.  Along the way, he reminds Americans that plague also has its claws in the United States though our medical system tends to keep things at bay.<br />Ultimately, Marriott gives us a good look into the foundations of modern medicine and how diseases came to be combated despite the combat, both intellectual and physical, between doctors of different nations and sensibilities.  He also reminds us in a rather subtle way of how primitive our response to deadly sickness remains despite our drugs and treatments--something that we need to be reminded of in a world where we could be called to respond to an epidemic on many fronts.  His prose may not be as gripping as some writers in this field (Richard Preston comes to mind) but he gets the job done in a very readable way.	2003-05-26

Certainly numbers like the primes, pi and &quot;e&quot; have properties that make them interesting to mathematicians and physical scientists alike.  Then there are numbers like 7, 13 and 666 that have other connotations for theologians, numerologists and the like.  And yet, some numbers have not gotten their due in recent years.  Phi--a number variously referred to as the golden ratio, golden section, and divine proportion among others--is one.  But Mario Livio has written a book in an attempt to remedy this situation.<br />Phi received its original definition from Euclid as an &quot;extreme and mean ratio&quot; when a straight line is cut so that the ratio of the entire line to the longer division of the segment is the same as the ratio of the longer division of the segment to the shorter.  And yet, much like the better known geometrical example of pi, phi turns out to have many more applications beyond its simplest geometrical definition.  Though measurable, phi is an irrational number with relationships to the Fibonacci sequence, fractals, the physical structure of things from plant growth and spiral shell development to the appearance of large-scale objects like galaxies, and more.  And beyond this, phi has been used as a basis applications in numerology and aesthetics.<br />Livio does a very good job of covering all this ground and more.  He is especially good at giving us a historical overview of the development of our understanding of this important number as well as explaining the mathematics in a way that is complete but easy to understand.  He is also very good at presenting the various mystical ways phi has been interpreted over the centuries, giving each a rigorous challenge--rejecting many but open-minded to the possibilities that any good Platonist would be.<br />In fact, if there is a weakness in this book, it is that Livio spends a lot of time covering these more esoteric applications of phi.  And yet, these applications are part of the history of the number and cannot be ignored whatever a reader might feel about the value of these applications.  Phi may not quite live up to the hype as &quot;the world's most astonishing number&quot; but certainly any reader with an interest in mathematics will not want to miss this book.ese applications are part of the history of the number and cannot be ignored whatever a reader might feel about the value of these applications.

Early every morning for 33 mornings a man, Emmett, gets up, makes a cup of coffee, lights a fire and thinks.  As a reader, we get to participate in Emmett's simple, yet detailed, musings on his life.  While doing so we develop a picture of a man with more clarity than most characters in modern fiction.  This is a story well worth reading.<br />Unfortunately, it is difficult for me to get past the fact that I spent [$$] on what is basically a short story.  A small book with widely spaced lines of 178 pages--I didn't do a word count but I would have been much happier if I had read this as part of an anthology of other stories.<br />I am a big fan of Nicholson Baker.  I think he is one of the best writers of prose in America today.  Therefore, I ultimately don't regret having purchased and read this story.  But if I were not a fan of Baker, I might feel a little ripped off.  It might be better to start with one of his other books like Nory or Double Fold.	2003-04-07

I find the concepts of zero and the vacuum very interesting and those are the very concepts that are the focus of this book.  Unfortunately, it did not quite live up to my expectations.<br />The first chapters of the book are quite good.  Barrow gives us a history lesson on the development of the mathematical concept of zero as well as the historical concept of &quot;nothing&quot; which science will turn into the concept of vacuum.  We get to read about the use of zero as a place holder in more complex numbering systems as well as its coming into being as a number.  We get to read about the some of the great scientists--Pascal, Newton, Michelson, Einstein--doing experiments and tossing around ideas like the aether.  All of this is interesting and well told.<br />However, about half-way through the wheels start to fall off.  Barrow is not nearly as good at explaining the modern concepts of the vacuum as he is about telling of its historical development.  Modern physics is again grappling with the question of whether or not a true vacuum can exist.  It may be that fluctuations in the vacuum caused the Big Bang and are constantly creating multiple universes, for example.  But though Barrow discusses these things, he does not do so in a very coherent manner.  Alan Guth, for instance, did a much better job of discussing these same subjects in his book on the inflationary universe theory.<br />Plus, Barrow is clearly out to toot his own horn a bit in the last couple chapters by mentioning his own contributions to the development of the subject.  It just so happens that his contributions don't seem nearly as important as other authors who have written on similar subjects.  For those readers interested in the history of zero and the vacuum, I would suggest reading this book through chapter five and then putting it aside.	2003-03-25

Her sophomore effort is a better book.<br />In this novel we have the story of Iris Greenfeder, a teacher and writer who is living in the shadow of her mother who was a successful author of two novels.  A third book in the trilogy never appeared as her mother labored over a manuscript but died without ever revealing it to anyone.  As she turns 40, bursts of small successes reconnect Iris to her mother and start her on a quest to solve some of the mysteries surrounding her mother's writing and strange death.<br />Unlike her first novel, however, this one depends much less on a \\"thrill ride\\" to keep things moving forward.  This novel centers much more on character and is interesting apart from the mysteries that unfold and get solved as the story progresses.  I also find the interpretations and reinterpretations of various fairy-tales to be quite intriguing.<br />Of course, the story still does have its weaknesses.  It climaxes in a burst of unnecessary surprise and destruction.  I get the feeling that Goodman is still unsure of herself on some level so that she has to hide her discomfort in providing \\"thrills\\" and \\"plot twists.\\"  Instead, simply letting her character studies grow to completion would produce a novel of true brilliance.  But she's making progress towards that.  I'm looking forward to seeing what she does with her next novel.	2003-03-25

I consider his novel Blindness to be one of the best novels I've read in the past five years.  The Cave only continues the growth of my respect for him.<br />I often find when I read one of Saramago's novels that I am reminded of other authors I enjoy.  Blindness reminds me of The Plague by Camus and The Cave reminds me of The Castle by Kafka.  I don't know if this is Saramago's intention.  Perhaps I am reading too much into things.  But Saramago is not writing lesser version of old stories.  He always has a unique take and, if anything, his stories are more accessible.<br />In The Cave there are two key locations--the village where the main character, Cipriano Algor, works in his traditional pottery, and The Center.  The Center is an ultra-modern complex of living and shopping whose residents never need to leave.  Even though most of the action takes place at the village, it is The Center that is the focus of the majority of attention.  It dominates the landscape both literally and figuratively.  Cipriano sells his wares there and has no control over if and what the bureaucrats of The Center will buy.  When his dishes are no longer wanted, he tries to sell ceramic dolls.  When these are not a success, he moves to The Center with his daughter and son-in-law but, after an eerie discovery, they leave The Center forever.<br />And yet, Saramago is not creating an allegory of traditional vs. modern.  He is telling the story of people.  In his unique style of long paragraphs with little punctuation, he creates a number of very vivid characters--not only Cipriano but also his daughter, Marta; son-in-law, Marcal; and the widow, Isaura.  Even the dog, Found, is a brilliant creation with a will of his own.<br />Admittedly, I don't believe I have plumbed the depths of this novel.  The meaning of the discovery at The Center that inspires them to run away is a bit of a mystery to me.  But I like a story that leaves me something to chew on.  This is a novel I will come back to and read again.  Saramago is that rare author who writes books worth re-reading.e something to chew on.  This is a novel I will come back to and read again.

In Life of Pi, Yann Martel has written a book of incredible beauty.<br />Unlike many highly praised books which rely on cleverness and complexity, the bulk of the story is a simple one.  A zookeeper's son and a handful of animals are the only survivors when their ship goes down in the Pacific.  In a matter of days, only the boy and a tiger are left.  We then get to see how the boy and tiger survive the better part of a year together on a lifeboat before they finally come aground in Mexico.  And yet, within this simple story is great depth of character and feeling.<br />To be honest, I found Part One of this novel to be the most interesting.  The world of the zoo in India, Pi's growth and participation in all three of the &quot;religions of Abraham,&quot; as well as the quirks of his family and friends makes for wonderful reading.  Once the shipwreck happens and the story turns to the survival of boy and tiger in Part Two, I thought the book lost a little.  The story continues to be a very honest and believable one with many interesting tidbits, but this kind of survival is ground that's been tread before though, admittedly, not often as well.  And despite the fact that Part Three brings the novel to a nice close, it doesn't have the fire of the beginning of the novel.<br />Ultimately, however, this book stands head and shoulders over most of what's published today.  Martel writes absolutely beautiful prose.  There are some wonderful, quotable turns of phrase in this novel which is a rare occurrence in most modern writers.  Pi is a deeply developed and sympathetic character.  And the story comes across as perfectly believable despite the strangeness of some of the events.  Martel's tone is one of incredible honesty.  This is a book not to be missed.	2003-02-18

He was a brilliant young Spaniard born into a world of religious upheaval and burgeoning science.  Though he would become a well-respected physician who was the first (even before Harvey) to discover pulmonary circulation, he ran into trouble when he passionately espoused anti-Trinitarian beliefs--beliefs deemed heresy not only by the Roman Catholic Church but by important Protestant strongholds as well.<br />The book is Christianismi Restituto.  It was in this book that Servetus argued his unitarian stand and put forth his idea of pulmonary circulation.  What was believed to be the last known copy of this book was chained to Servetus' leg as he was burned at the stake in Geneva in 1553.  Of course, the book did survive; otherwise, there would be no story to tell and Servetus would be lost to history.<br />In fact, as we learn through the pages of this wonderful book by the Goldstones, three copies of the book survived and are now extremely valuable.  As a book collector, the story of the provenance of the three surviving copies is fascinating in itself.  But there is much more of interest here than the story of a book.<br />Much along the lines of the trend started by Dava Sobel in Longitude, the Goldstones tell the story of a much forgotten but most important moment in history.  Amid the background of the development of printing and the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation, we learn of a man who made a huge scientific discovery that was basically forgotten for most of a century and re-discovered by the man who is usually credited with the discovery (Harvey).  But, more importantly, we learn of a man who is swept up in the spirit of Protestantism and yet is destroyed by the very forces he helped to create.<br />In fact, the story of the conflict between Servetus and Calvin is the most fascinating part of this book.  In a world where the word &quot;Inquisition&quot; is a staple of criticism against the Roman Catholic church, it is important to be reminded that Protestant churches were often quick to burn those they considered heretics as well.  Which makes it even more ironic that one of the three original surviving copies of this heretical book is Calvin's personal copy.<br />All in all, this is a fascinating book.  It is a wonderful history not only of a person but also of an era of upheaval and intellectual ferment.

I was attracted to this book by the subtitle: &quot;The Private Life of Sir Isaac Newton.&quot;  As a teacher of math and physics, how could I resist a book that uses one of my heroes as a main character?  Of course, I should have remembered the old adage about the disappointment in meeting your heroes.<br />In this novel we find Isaac Newton as the Warden of the Royal Mint.  The story is told through the eyes of Christopher Ellis, Newton's assistant.  The two men are investigating illegeal coining which leads them to a plot to overthrow the government.  Needless to say, they save the day.<br />The storyline of this novel is filled with murders and intrigue--interesting enough for an easy-to-read thriller.  And Kerr does a good enough job giving us a sense of London at the close of the seventeenth century.  What was missing, for me, was Newton.<br />In many ways, despite the subtitle, Newton is a secondary character in this novel after Ellis.  This is fine, on one level, but when Newton does appear he comes off as more of a poor man's Sherlock Holmes than a unique character.  Perhaps I have studied histories of Newton too much to be an objective reader, but the Newton Kerr brings forth in his novel is difficult for me to reconcile with what I have always imagined Newton was like.  Not that Kerr gets facts wrong, he doesn't.  It just feels wrong to me.  And so it was difficult for me to enjoy this novel.	2003-01-03

But these are merely the main characters in a long, Dickensian, Victorian novel that comes in at something over 800 pages.  As a reader who finds the modern trend towards novels of something less that 200 only mildly interesting pages, I was excited and hopeful to see a book like this.  It almost lived up to my expectations.<br />Faber is working in the tradition of Dickens and Hardy but he is not quite up to the challenge.  Admittedly, he had created some wonderful characters here.  Sugar and, in particular, Agnes are well-developed personalities.  Additionally, as often happens, some of the secondary characters are more memorable than the main characters.  I found William's brother Henry and Henry's friend Mrs. Fox to be extraordinarily interesting. And, at least their story is told to completion.<br />This is my major complaint about this novel.  After working our way through 800 pages we are brought to an abrupt ending of the story of our major characters.  And I am not a person who necessarily needs closure but I do need some kind of satisfactory completion to at least a piece of the story.  To be honest, I felt like Faber just got tired of writing (or his deadline was near) and he had to get the thing done.  Boom!--the novel's done.  And the paragraph that serves as epilogue to the story is nothing but a confirmation of the cop-out.  It is very disappointing to have invested so much time and energy into these characters and to be left so unsatisfied.<br />I also found Faber's technique of speaking directly to the reader to be mildly irritating.  Admittedly, this style fades away after a few hundred pages only to rear its ugly head again as the novel nears its end but some readers may enjoy this technique better than me.<br />Still, when push comes to shove, this is a book worth reading.  Finally, we have a novel that lasts long enough that the reader can really know something about the characters.  And anyone with a bent towards Victorian novels will find this novel to be a good, albeit more explicit, example of the genre.  It's worth a few shortfalls to involve yourself in the experience of this world.el that lasts long enough that the reader can really know something about the characters.

In this case, Ken Alder has decided to tell the story of Mechain and Delambre, two &quot;savants&quot; who were charged with determining the length of the meter.  Originally, the meter was defined to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the north pole to the equator.  So Mechain and Delambre set out to measure the length of the meridian more accurately than had ever been done before.<br />Like the best books about science, The Measure of All Things shows the nature of real science.  First, that science is performed by real people like Mechain and Delambre with their own strengths and foibles; it does not just appear miraculously in textbooks.  Second, the development of science is influenced by the history of the time such as the revolutionary period in France through which most of this story takes place.<br />But because this book is describing the determination of the meter--the basis of the scientific measurement system--it shows other important aspects of science that are often forgotten.  For example, the important idea that how we measure things is ultimately completely arbitrary.  Despite our natural desire to find the &quot;absolute&quot; meter, there is no such thing as Mechain and Delambre discover.  We can choose the length of the meter to be whatever we want as long as--and here's the difficult part--we get everyone to agree.  The problems of getting the meter accepted, even in France where it was developed, is a fascinating part of this book.<br />The cover of my edition of this book touts the &quot;hidden error that transformed the world.&quot;  This is a bit of marketing strategy to entice those, I think, who like to read about other's mistakes.  But, as a scientist, I see this notation of error as being a part of what science is.  Modern science understands that measurement is never error-free but this was not always understood and bothered scientists like Mechain.  It is very worthwhile for non-scientists to see how scientists learned to deal with the fact that there are always limitations to their measurements.<br />Anyone interested in the importance of measurement in science would be amiss is passing this book by.  Alder has provided a readable account of the development of the basis of our modern, nearly-universal method of measurement.

Mason takes us from the city of London through the jungles of Burma with ease and a vividness that suggests his acquaintance with the area.  Beyond that, he recreates the Victorian era with its quirks and lust for empire that has the flavor of the best of the Victorian novelists though his prose is somewhat less dense (and rich) than a Dickens or Hardy.<br />This novel tells the story of a British piano tuner who is recruited by the British army to travel from London to Burma to tune a piano for an eccentric but successful British officer at a remote outpost.  This is the novel in a nutshell but, of course, my description does little justice to the well-crafted characters--in addition to the tuner &amp; commander there are a number of fascinating encounters with the likes of the Man with One Story (my personal favorite) and Khin Myo, the tuner's enchanting helpmate in Burma.  It also does little justice to the varied way Mason lets the plot of the novel unfold.<br />I am particularly pleased that Mason is able to avoid any simple answers to the large issues he addresses.  I was sure I had an idea about how this novel was going to end and it played quite against my expectations.  This is a rare quality for me to find in any novel and I enjoy it immensely.<br />I did find the end of the story to come rather suddenly and in a bit of a rush.  Because of that, I was somewhat disappointed but I feel I understood Mason's reasons so that softened the blow a little bit.  It's almost as if he realized that if he didn't end the novel soon it was going to become so enmeshed and complicated that even he wouldn't have been able to work it out.  As it is, he stopped himself in time to create a delightful novel.	2002-12-01

Whereas Roth's prose is energetic and in-your-face, Yoshimoto's flows like a gentle stream.  Even the little tirades of Tsugumi, Yoshimoto's bratty title character, has nothing of the unsettling energy of a character like Roth's Portnoy.  Instead, Yoshimoto's stories have a beauty that is almost ethereal.  Granted, I have yet to be moved as much as I was by Yoshimoto's first novel, Kitchen.  Still, this novel came close.<br />It is the story of a young woman, Tsugumi, who has been dying since the day she was born from some unnamed illness.  Except that she continues to live despite occasional lapses into sickness.  But her seeming physical weakness and poor health has made all those around her cater to her relentlessly and she has grown into a spoiled and mean young woman.  The story is told by Maria, a friend of Tsugumi's.  Through Maria's eyes we see Tsugumi's petty cruelties but also her capacity for love and an incredible inner strength that keeps her alive, inspiring Maria to accept the challenges of her own life.<br />In some ways, Tsugumi is one of the most interesting characters Yoshimoto has created.  And she avoids many of the cliches that often seem to inhabit books where a key character is facing death.  Once again, Yoshimoto has created a slim volume of incredible beauty.	2002-12-01

An extended essay on the quirky subject of ruins is not something that I think would stand out as a potential bestseller in an editor's eyes.  Fortunately, someone took the chance and we have access to this interesting little book.<br />In it, Woodward takes us through the subject of ruins.  Not only ruins we can still see today but also ruins that have disappeared over time.  Not only physical ruins but also ruins that can be seen in and have influenced art and literature both classic and modern.  Not only an objective account of the formation and impact of the ruin but also his visceral impressions and those of other observers both famous and not.<br />One wouldn't think there was enough about ruins to fill 250 pages but this book proves that misconception false.  In fact, there is a lot here that I wasn't aware of or didn't give much thought to before.  For example, I tend to think of ruins in the classical sense (such as Roman or Greek ruins) but Woodward also discusses the effect dealing with the ruins of recent wars (in particular, WWII) has had on people.  He also discusses the trend in vogue a few hundred years ago towards the wealthy actually building ruins as objects d'arte on their estates.  I never realized that some of the ruins one can see while traveling through England and France were in reality artificially created.<br />Anyone who has ever marveled at the Colosseum or Parthenon, anyone who has ever meditated inside the crumbling walls of an old abbey, anyone who has ever wondered about that abandoned house down the street, anyone who has read Shelly's The Last Man or been shocked by the final frames of Planet of the Apes, will find something of value in Woodward's pages.	2002-12-01

Since then, I've come across mentions of the legend in a number of places, including some interesting papal histories.  However, I had never looked into the story seriously so I decided to read a few books.  One of the first I came across was this one by Peter Stanford.<br />I was reasonably pleased with this book.  Stanford appears to have done some serious research into the historical sources of the story of the female pope.  In addition, he has relates a number of interviews with important historians both inside and outside the Vatican.  Most importantly, the book is quite easy to read as he tells it more as the story of his personal search for the truth as opposed to a dry history.<br />This, however, is also the source of the book's main weakness.  Stanford is clearly prejudiced before he even begins his search.  Clearly, he believes there was such a person as Pope Joan and he is merely looking for pieces of information to back up his position.  Granted, he is honest enough to admit that there is absolutely no way a definitive answer to this question will ever come but this cannot cover his strong belief that there was such a person.<br />I, myself, believe it is highly likely a person like Joan lived at some time in papal history but Stanford's faith is distracting.  Still, he is quite thorough and makes a number of good points both pro and con.  For someone interested in the subject, this book is a worthwhile read.	2002-12-01

But after coming across commentary on him in a couple different sources, I decided to try him myself.  I am quite glad I did.<br />Structurally, this novel is a marvel.  It is the story of Alexander Portnoy as told by himself to his psychiatrist.  Written basically as an extended stream-of-consciousness rant, this story never lets up on its intensity.  I was constantly amazed at how Roth was able to maintain what I would call a \\"shrieking tone\\" throughout the novel.  As I think back on it, all I seen to remember is people screaming.  And yet, it works.<br />Granted, things seem a bit over the top in the novel.  Portnoy's obsession with his Jewish roots in New Jersey and, particularly, his obsession with sex go beyond hysteria.  But, as a reader, you're willing to go along because the structure of the novel labels Portnoy as a mental case.  Besides, Portnoy/Roth tells it all so well.<br />Of course, it is easy to see why this book would have caused so much controversy when it was published.  The Jewish community would be outraged at their depiction and many would find all the sex talk disgusting.  Fortunately, I am not easily disgusted.  Despite the hysteria of the novel, there is a lot of truth here.  I don't feel as extremely about my youth as Portnoy does and I'm not Jewish but I found myself identifying with Portnoy many times.  His feelings reflect universal ones.  People willing to take the risk will find a book filled with insight and amazing prose.	2002-11-02
US	50946478	R23DTWA9AN5PB4	0679748989	655716976	The Ghost Writer	Books	5	2	3	N	Y	Appeals to Me	The first of Roth's sequence of books about the writer Nathan Zuckerman, this novel finds Zuckerman a young man recently out of college invited to spend an evening with an author he admires, E. I. Lonoff.  While there he meets the author's wife, Hope, and his assistant and possible mistress, Amy Bellette.  As the evening progresses, Zuckerman is witness to a drama of emotion played out between these three people.<br />Admittedly, it is difficult for me to be objective about this book because it speaks to me personally on so many levels.  As an aspiring writer myself, I identify easily with Zuckerman's emotions on meeting an idol and trying to deal with the reality of the dream.  I also recognize Zuckerman's tendency as a writer to let his imagination play out scenarios of explanation to understand things he's witnessed.  To wit, his extended imagining of Amy as Anne Frank, who has somehow survived the concentration camp and hidden her identity, even while becoming one of the most famous people in the world through her diary.  As someone who reads my other reviews will realize, I'm an amateur Anne Frank historian so I found this fiction particularly interesting and, on some levels, quite believable.  Certainly it has crossed the mind of everyone who has studied Anne Frank to wonder what she would be like if she had survived.  Roth gives us a possibility.<br />Ultimately, I found this brief novel quite satisfying.  Roth's ability to write readable prose is beyond question.  So, if the summary of the story sounds interesting to you, it is definitely worth the single sitting it would take to read it.	2002-11-02

Not all award-winning books are the best books around but the Newbery has shown itself to be a consistent sign of quality.  Of course, even within this group, the excellence varies.<br />Though not my favorite among the Newberys, there is a lot here to like.  As a boy who grew up in downstate Illinois myself, there is a lot in this story that I find very familiar.  Not the least being the wonderfully drawn character of the grandmother who powers through the losses of the Depression with an iron will.<br />I have to admit that I enjoyed A Long Way from Chicago more than this one.  Still, that may be because the first novel has a male protagonist with whom I identify a little more.  Ultimately, however, this is a worthy read, especially for anyone who wants a taste of what it was like to live in the Midwest in the 1930's.	2002-10-14

Her poem &quot;Sunworshippers&quot;from her last book, School Figures, may be my favorite poem written in the past 10 years.  In this book, The Land of Bliss, Song continues to develop as a poet and presents us with another collection of beautiful and moving verse.<br />The opening poem of the collection, &quot;Pokanini girl,&quot; is reminiscent of Gwendolyn Brooks' &quot;We Real Cool&quot; but with a painful humor lacking in Brooks' sparse verse.  Much of Song's strength in her verse comes from an uncanny ability to write mature poetry with the voice of a child.  She is at once both adult and child.  And she is very connected to her family and history (Chinese immigrants living in Hawaii).  It gives much of her poetry an amazing power.<br />I am also struck by the recurrence of the color blue in these poems: poems with titles like &quot;Blue,&quot; &quot;Blueroses&quot; and &quot;The Sky-Blue Dress.&quot;  There are blue roses painted on the box in &quot;The Roses of Guadalajara,&quot; blue sleeves in &quot;A City of Sleeves&quot; and the hanging letters on pale blue lines in &quot;Book of Hours.&quot;  This color of sadness is a key to the tone of melancholy that runs through much of Song's work.  And yet the beauty remains as illustrated in the recurrence of flowers and, in particular, roses.<br />I am constantly reminding people that, yes, the poetry of the past masters is wonderful but there is also a lot of amazing poetry still being written today.  We just need to work a little harder to seek it out than the readers of past eras.  Well, if you've come upon this review you have found your way to a wonderful modern poet.  I would highly recommend this book.	2002-10-14

This is a straightforward tale of revenge.  A petty schoolboy revenge for imagined wrongs by a group of boys on a popular classmate, Ned Maddstone, accidentally unleashes a chain of events that puts Ned through a literal hell.  Years later, Ned escapes and viciously exacts revenge on everyone who was connected to the wrong done him.<br />Honestly, I ended up liking this book much more than I thought I would.  That is despite being a fan of Stephen Fry as both an actor an a writer.  He's made his name in comedy, however, and this book is not particularly humorous.  Instead, it is brutal and relentless.  It made for an interesting change.<br />This book has no surprises and that is it's biggest surprise.  I was constantly waiting for the big revelation that never came.  There are no really mysterious twists and turns.  Just a freight train that can't be stopped.  I was surprised by how satisfying I found the journey.  No moralizing about the evils of exacting revenge.  Nobody who even really tries that hard to stop the cogs of revenge.  Just the story.  But it will stick with you.	2002-08-19

My brother and I would go to the park on US Open and Wimbleton weekends and pretend we were the different pros while playing our mildly [bad] matches.  I was a fan on McEnroe's but it was always kind of a love/hate relationship because I saw my childish self in him.  I was a bit petulant myself when I played sports but, on the other hand, I was always embarrassed by my behavior and wished I could control it.  I guess I projected some of these feelings onto McEnroe.<br />It was nice, therefore, to read his book.  To be honest, I really didn't know much about him and it was interesting to get a look at how he became a tennis star.  And interesting to see what he did with his fame.  Let's face it, people like McEnroe get to do a lot more than those of us who work for a living and it's fun to live vicariously through them.  This isn't a book filled with shocking revelations, if that's what you're looking for, but it is a real romp at times.<br />I tend to read autobiographies as opposed to biographies.  I think it's usually more fun to read what a person has to say about themselves as opposed to what others have to say about them.  A person writing about their own life has an agenda, of course, just like any biographer but this just tells you even more about them.  In this book, despite the help from Mr. Kaplan, McEnroe sounds like McEnroe.  And that's what I wanted to read.  If you are a fan, you should definitely take a look.	2002-08-19

Certainly this is understandable and it is important to remember the Holocaust in the hopes that something like it will never happen again.  Unfortunately, as Ms. Power reminds us, genocide happened before the Holocaust and continues to happen.<br />Even though Powers deals strictly with the twentieth century, the slaughter of entire races and peoples is older than history.  What is sad to realize for those of us who like to believe that the human race is progressing is that this slaughter continues to happen.  In fact, it seems to be happening with an even colder efficiency in our modern age.  Americans like to believe that we are against such things (now that Native Americans are no longer a threat) but Power points out our continual failure to act in the face of the killings of the last 100 years.<br />Power begins her discussion with the attempt by the Turks to destroy the Armenians during World War I.  Technically, this was not a \\"genocide\\" because the word had not been coined as of yet.  It was, instead, a \\"massacre\\" or \\"atrocity\\" of war about which we could do nothing since we were involved in a war at the time and our resources were occupied.  As Power points out, however, this superficial excuse which has been used time and again for inaction only covers deeper reasons.  These reasons center around disbelief in provided information, American isolationism and the lack of political value in helping others in such a situation.<br />The turning point, of course, was the Holocaust.  The scale of the destruction was so great that Americans in particular felt guilt about our inaction when the slaughter became widely known.  It was in the years of World War II that a Polish refugee and lawyer named Raphael Lemkin invented the term \\"genocide\\" and worked tirelessly until his death to get the United Nations to recognize that genocide was something against which the UN needed to act.<br />And yet, the years since the Holocaust have seen the killing fields of Cambodia, the attempted destruction of the Kurds by Saddam Hussein, the \\"ethnic cleansing\\" in Bosnia and the tribal wars of Rwanda, just to name a few.  Power describes these situations in great detail and points out how, again and again, the United States has failed to act effectively, if at all, even when it was in our power to do so.  Many of these events have taken place recently despite our repeated promises of \\"never again\\" after the Holocaust.  Power is very effective in pointing out how US foreign policy has continually been unresponsive to genocide and I for one was very distressed to see our failures--a failure in which we as citizens must take our share of the blame.  But I was glad to have my eyes opened.<br />I hope a lot of people will read this and have their eyes opened.  Power is fair in pointing out that we have made some progress against genocide (in Kosovo and the prosecution of Milosevic) but that we have a very long way to go.  Hopefully, readers of this book will become more aware and be ready to push America into action when we become aware of genocide again./>And yet, the years since the Holocaust have seen the killing fields of Cambodia, the attempted destruction of the Kurds by Saddam Hussein, the \\"ethnic cleansing\\" in Bosnia and the tribal wars of Rwanda, just to name a few.

Mr. Rees does not really address this question in his book.  What he does, however, is show how our understanding of the universe is based on numbers that have to be very finely tuned indeed for our universe to be the way it is.  Just six numbers, in fact.<br />This is a very intriguing book.  Rees gives a good introduction to many of the most fundamental things in science--forces like gravity and electromagnetism, the formation and structure of matter, cosmic expansion and many other things.  Moreover, he is not afraid to give these concepts symbol and number and show how these values are determined by theory and observation.  Most importantly, he then goes on to discuss how variations in these numbers by even very slight amounts in most cases would lead to a very different universe from the one in which we currently find ourselves.  This does much to strengthen many of the arguments he makes concerning those parts of modern scientific theory that is mainly speculation.<br />If there is a weakness in this book, it is in the author's decision to frame his discussion around symbols and numbers.  As a physicist and mathematician, I myself am quite comfortable with it but some readers might be frightened off by these Greek letters and numbers that are often so large or small as to be effectively meaningless.  Even more so since these symbols and numbers are so far from what even a high school educated reader might come across in a math or physics class.  It might have been more effective to link these ideas up to some concepts a high school educated person might have seen before.<br />Still, it is part of Rees' purpose, I think, to take us to the cutting edge of physics and cosmology without trudging through every detail.  He wants to give us a taste of what are some of the most exciting and thought-provoking things happening today.  This is a fair purpose and one that he achieves very well in only 161 pages.  It is certainly worth a read.air purpose and one that he achieves very well in only 161 pages.  It is certainly worth a read.	2002-07-23

His book The Making of the Atomic Bomb remains the best book I have ever read on the subject.  He has also written interesting books on disease and the psychology of murder.  In fact, this book seems to have grown from his study of the work of Lonnie Athens, an American criminologist, who was the subject of Rhodes' last book, Why They Kill.  Here Rhodes investigates the SS-Einsatzgruppen, the teams of killers in Hitler's Germany who would begin the slaughters that would become the Holocaust.<br />When most of us think of the Holocaust, we think of death camps like Auschwitz, the gas chambers and crematoria.  What most people forget is that the earliest killings were done by groups of SS-Einsatzgruppen in the field.  Literally millions of people were simply murdered through beatings, firing squads and other \\"basic\\" methods long before the construction of the first death camps.  It was the effect of this \\"face-to-face\\" slaughter on the morale and morals of the men who carried it out that would lead to the more industrial, impersonal methods of the death camps in later years.<br />Rhodes reminds of something very important in this book: yes, the Holocaust was a horrible thing but it was conducted by human beings, not monsters.  The Holocaust did not just suddenly appear as a particularly horrible idea.  The development of the Holocaust was a process that can be traced and, possibly, understood.  And Rhodes makes an excellent stab at trying to understand what happened.  In the process, he examines the psychology of people like Heinrich Himmler and many of the other people who attempted to carry out the Final Solution.  Plus, he gives a fresh look at an important part of history that gets swamped in our knowledge of the Holocaust.  It is well worth the read.	2002-07-23

I chose it because I am a huge fan of Charles Dickens and because I've enjoyed a number of Jane Smiley's novels.  Unfortunately, I have to admit to being a bit disappointed.<br />The basics are all here--his life, his books and his death.  But it's all rather dry.  It reads like a Masters student's thesis as opposed to a book for popular consumption.  Plus, there's very little actual biography here.  It's very heavy on some rather uninsightful analysis of Dickens' novels which isn't helpful in a book that's only some 200 pages to begin with.  Certainly, it's not useful for someone who knows very little about Dickens and might have read only a little by him.<br />This book would have been better targeted at a reader who is unfamiliar with Dickens at all.  More lively stories about the man himself might actually end up drawing new readers to this fabulous author.  What is needed here is a vivid picture of a man; instead we get a rather bland portrait and literary commentary.  This book may be brief but it reads longer than a number of more ambitious biographies.  I hope other biographies in this series are better done than this.	2002-07-19

There is nothing better than a good book discussion.  Everyone who takes reading seriously has ideas on what the best and most important books are.  Certainly Harold Bloom is a serious reader and in this book he offers us his insights into some of the highlights of the past 500 years in Western literature.  Even so, in 500 pages he is able to give us only about 25 authors.  Fortunately, he also gives us a number of appendices listing many others.<br />At the head of Bloom's &quot;western canon&quot; is, not surprisingly, William Shakespeare.  In fact, I would probably agree with Bloom on the basic fact of Shakespeare's importance to Western literature; however, if there is a weakness in Bloom's book, it his constant references to Shakespeare throughout the book.  I admire Shakespeare as probably the single greatest dramatist in English but I do not think everything written since is simply a homage or reaction to Shakespeare.  Shakespeare changed all of literature after him but he had his sources.  Shakespeare was a source for writers after him but Cervantes, Montaigne, Whitman, Kafka and others altered our literature in ways that have no relationship to Shakespeare.<br />I also have trouble with the idea that Falstaff is the most important Shakespearean character or that King Lear is the most important play.  When Bloom focuses on these ideas he reveals his prejudices.  He also reveals himself as an old man.  We all relate most closely to those characters in which we can see our reflection.  I somehow doubt that Falstaff was Bloom's favorite when he was in his twenties.<br />Still, despite his obsession with Shakespeare, Bloom's intellect and experience range wide.  He has a number of wonderful insights into the various authors he discusses and I admire his belief in the importance of literature.  It is a belief that I share.  Additionally, I enjoy Bloom's digs at feminist, Marxist and Freudian criticism.  Though I feel they have made some important contributions to literary criticism, I would agree with Bloom's assertions concerning the damage they have done as well.  I agree strongly with the idea that a book must earn a place in the canon by its brilliance and originality; not simply because it was written by a woman or a minority.<br />But, ultimately, we need not worry too much about the canon, I think.  Books are suffering these days, it is true, but reading will never become obsolete and so literature will survive.  And the canon will constantly reinvent itself as books are rediscovered and authors go in and out of vogue.  (Even Shakespeare's popularity waxes and wanes.)  Still, whether in a peak of popularity or a trough, some authors and their works will always be read and studied and this is how an author makes it to the canon.  It is not a position granted by literature professors, no matter how much they wish it might be so.  But it's nice to have professor's like Bloom to keep us talking about it.literary criticism, I would agree with Bloom's assertions concerning the damage they have done as well.

Rarely do I think a book is so important and so good that it should be read by everyone.  Atul Gawande has written such a book.<br />America has the best health care in the world and yet our health care system is a mess.  High insurance rates and malpractice suits make for a situation where patients often cannot get the help they need and many doctors are afraid of taking risks because of the chance of being sued.  With a willingness to realize certain things and make some changes, America could turn it's medical services into a true blessing for all of its citizens.<br />What is the most important realization?  That doctors are human beings and even the best of them are going to make mistakes from time to time.  This is probably the most important point Gawande makes in his book.  It is a sad state of affairs when every single doctor in this nation expects to be the defendant in a major lawsuit at least once in their careers.  How many possible brilliant doctors has this single fact driven from the profession?  It is one thing when a doctor makes an error through maliciousness but a doctor who makes an honest mistake should not have to fear career destruction.  If something could be done about all this litigation, it would likely be easier to drive truly bad doctors from the profession because doctors and hospitals would be more like to start admitting when things go haywire and actually make a concerted effort to try to make things better.<br />Though his insights into what it's like to be a doctor are incredibly valuable, I find his views on the psychology of being a patient interesting as well.  His articles on the mystery of pain, the horrors of nausea & blushing (yes, blushing) and the results of a patient who has undergone gastric bypass surgery for obesity are eye-openers.  He also has a very good chapter on the ethics of medical decision-making between a patient and doctor.

This is despite the fact that it contains what I consider to be one of the best poems written in the past ten years, &quot;His Days.&quot;  This brilliant poem of a man trapped and lonely in a world of his own creation speaks so powerfully to me that I read it over and over as the years pass.  It was because I was so struck by this poem when I read it in a magazine years ago that I kept an eye out for this book when it appeared.  Perhaps my expectations were too high but there is not another poem in this book that reaches the level of &quot;His Days.&quot;<br />That is not to say that there aren't some good things here.  In particular, I find &quot;Summer Rain&quot; and &quot;from Sewanee in Ruins: Part I&quot; to be excellent poems.  The problem I think I have with many of these poems is that they are too specific and too personal to the author.  I feel outside many of the poems looking in instead of being drawn into the world of the poem.<br />Still, it is difficult for me to be too critical.  It is worth having this book for &quot;His Days&quot; alone.  If, as a poet myself, I write a single verse as powerful as this, I would be a happy man.	2002-06-21

Though I can't say it is one of the best novels I have ever read, it certainly has its appeals.  It is a book of irony and humor, with some sharp insights into the world of the Catholic Church in America.  It is the story of the struggles of Father Urban, a priest in the unknown Order of St. Clement, who progressive, dynamic approach to his vocation seems constantly in conflict with those around him.<br />On many levels, I found that this book spoke to me personally.  I know that comedy is very difficult to write and this novel is incredibly funny in places.  Also, as a young Catholic boy growing up in the Midwest that is the setting of this novel, the story constantly generated feelings of recognition in me.  The points that Powers is trying to make about spirituality, religion and the Church are worthwhile and brought out well.<br />The weaknesses I found in this book also are quite personal to me.  Though the characters are drawn quite vividly and well, I found their relentless superficiality to be very disturbing.  I don't enjoy reading novels where I find it difficult to like any of the characters but this is a matter of taste.  Many other readers might feel differently.  Clearly, Powers is telling us something important about the religious life but I think I would have enjoyed the story more if there was at least one character in the novel I found admirable.  I guess I don't think it's enough to tell us what's wrong with things.  I also like a glimpse of what's right.<br />Still, Powers has written a powerful novel.  And Urban does have his good qualities and comes to an epiphany of sorts at the story's close.  Anyone who is interested in stories of spirituality and has an interest in the Catholic Church will find this novel to be funny and thought-provoking.  It is definitely worth a read.	2002-06-21

I have read all of his major novels (some numerous times) and many of his other works.  The most important things to know about Dickens are right there in his own words.  However, the man himself is a fascinating subject from his rise through a poor youth to his triumph as the most famous authors of his age or, indeed, any age.  Certainly, Dickens is worthy of a well-written biography.  Fortunately, there are well-done ones out there.<br />I had read Kaplan's book a number of years ago and recently read it again.  It remains one of the best.  Kaplan gives us a complete and balanced portrait of Dickens' entire life.  He is sufficiently laudatory of Dickens' successes without being fawning.  Additionally, he is not afraid to point out Dickens' weaknesses--as a son, husband, father, friend and author, though his weaknesses as a author are few enough.  We get a real sense of Dickens as a human being.<br />One of the reasons I think Kaplan is so successful in his portrait is that he weaves numerous quotes from letters by Dickens and his many correspondents almost seamlessly into the text.  It gives more of a feeling for Dickens as a man of his time as opposed to looking back and trying to compose a modern view of him.  I also like the way Kaplan shows Dickens as an acute observer who integrated people and places he knew into his fiction.  There are risks in reading a novel too biographically but it is interesting to try to pin down an author's inspirations and themes.  Kaplan handles this quite well but he doesn't go into any of the novels in depth so someone unfamiliar with Dickens' books might have trouble in some places.<br />Overall, Kaplan finds an nice balance between depth and readability.  He is able to pack a lot into 556 pages.  Anyone with an interest in Dickens would be foolish not to read one of the best biographies of the man in print.	2002-06-21

One of the outcomes of the war that is not always remembered or recognized as part of this period is the worldwide outbreak of a deadly influenza in 1918.  I remember seeing a documentary on the so-called \\"Spanish flu\\" of 1918 when I was a very young child that has always stayed with me and may be part of the reason I am so interested in the period.  Finding a book that focuses on this important historical event has been difficult, however, until now.<br />Gina Kolata has written an intriguing book about an epidemic that still remains a mystery over 80 years later.  Near the end of the first world war, an outbreak of flu swept the world killing more people over a wider area in a shorter period than any other disease before or since.  At least 40 million people were killed worldwide and, strangely, this flu killed young people in the prime of life rather than the very young and old that usually succumb to flu outbreaks.  Then, almost overnight, the epidemic faded away and the world did its best to forget the destruction.<br />In the first part of the book, Kolata takes us through what little is known about how this virus was able to sweep through the world in 1918.  In the second part, she recounts how various scientists since that time have attempted to isolate a sample of the virus so it can be studied with modern technology.  This part of the story takes us to the Arctic to exhume frozen victims of the flu and to Army warehouses where preserved tissue of military victims still remains in storage.  All in all, it makes for a fascinating story of medicine's quest to understand past epidemics and hopefully prevent future outbreaks.<br />In a world that has tensions based on the concept of biological weapons and terror, this is a book that makes for an interesting read.  It reminds us that biological disasters are, first and foremost, natural happenings that can reoccur at any time.  It also points out the importance of continued research into the causes and cures for viruses that seem as simple and harmless as the flu.  We cannot get so involved in protecting ourselves from esoteric diseases and threats that could very well end up being relatively harmless that we forget to do basic research into diseases that have shown themselves to be continually harmful.l disasters are, first and foremost, natural happenings that can reoccur at any time.

Unfortunately, the only poets most of us know are the past masters we were taught about in school.  This is nothing against the past masters--I love their poetry as well.  We need to remember, however, that there is a lot of great poetry still being written.  This slim book of mostly quite short poems demonstrates that.<br />There are a lot of good poems here, especially in the first two sections.  The overall theme of the book is memory and loss, including a recognition that what we have now will eventually be lost and become memory.  There are some very powerful images here.<br />In the opening poem, \\"Women on the Shore,\\" we find in the opening line (The pills I take to postpone death/ are killing me...) and closing lines (If death is everywhere we look,/ at least let's marry it to beauty.) a kind of description of the book as a whole.  So many of these poems are memories of loss--from \\"Practicing\\" where a man wishes he hadn't given up piano lessons as a boy to \\"The Answering Machine\\" inspired by the recorded voice of a dead friend.  \\"43rd Anniversary\\" and \\"In the Garden\\" I think are also very strong poems.<br />My favorite sequence here, though, is in part 2 of the book where we find poems I've taken to calling \\"people as memory\\" poems which remind us that it is people, not things, that are our best link to the past, ourselves and our future.  \\"Family History,\\" \\"March 5,\\" and \\"The Last Uncle\\" are excellent examples of this.<br />Anyone interested in seeing some of the excellence in what is being done in poetry today would be amiss in not taking a look at this collection.	2002-06-16

The other award that I think does as well is the Newbery Medal.  As always, there is varying quality even among the winners of this award but I found this book to be one of the best of the best.<br />First of all, I always appreciate books that take me to places I've never been.  Certainly, this story of twelfth century Korea does that.  Additionally, it describes various processes of pottery-making, something else with which I was not very familiar.<br />Most importantly, however, this is a story filled with wonderful characters.  Tree-ear is an orphan who lives beneath a bridge with an old man named Crane-man.  Slowly, Tree-ear works his way into the family of a master potter, Min & his wife, by doing work which the old potter now finds difficult.  Ultimately, Tree-ear is sent on a long journey to the capital with a sample of Min's work to obtain a royal commission but, when the samples are destroyed along the way, he can only take a shard of the former pottery to the commissioner.<br />This is a beautiful story which is well worth reading--and that includes any \\"adults\\" who might be reading this.  Remember, if you can't read a \\"children's book\\" and enjoy it, then your child should probably not be reading it either.	2002-06-16
US	50946478	R2WVGKOY34RSMQ	0738205419	739926268	The Annotated Flatland: A Romance Of Many Dimensions	Books	5	72	72	N	Y	Intellectual Fun with Commentary	Flatland is a novel originally published in 1884 by Edwin A. Abbott.  It is told from the point of view of A. Square, that four-sided resident of the titular country.  The first part of the book consists of a description of what it is like to live in a two-dimensional world.  The second part concerns A. Square's encounter with a sphere and his subsequent &quot;visions&quot; of pointland, lineland and spaceland.<br />The purpose of this novel is two-fold: to introduce the casual reader into the concepts of multi-dimensional spaces (i.e. what will become the concept of four dimensional space-time) and to provide social commentary on Victorian society.  I cannot comment much on what he achieves in terms of opening the eyes of the Victorian reader to the ills of that society; however, I find his ability to illuminate the concepts of dimensionality extra-ordinary.  As a math and physics teacher, I am always looking for ways to open my students' minds to visualizing what they are doing.  Even after well over 100 years, few people have approached Abbott's clarity in helping people visualize the difference between different dimensions.  One of the best examples: a square only &quot;looks&quot; like a square to someone who can see in three dimensions.  A square itself, trapped in a plane, would see another square (or, indeed, any figure) only as a line.  This leads to intriguing thoughts on what creatures who live in higher dimensions than our own see as they look at us.<br />Of course, the story of Flatland alone is wonderful but Stewart's annotation and commentary take the book to another level.  On nearly every page, Stewart offers insight and background into the text.  Unable to resist the pun: he added another dimension to the book.  Having read Flatland many years ago and enjoyed it, I felt I understood the book much better this time around with Stewart's help.  Anyone with an interest in math and physics should not pass up the opportunity to read this edition of Flatland.and.	2002-06-02

Two of my trips have taken me through the southern parts of the country--Andalusia (al-Andalus) and its environs--that make up the setting for much of this story.  It is a beautiful part of the world and Menocal has provided us with a wonderful history of the area during the time of its greatest glory:  the Middle Ages.  From 711 until 1492, the Iberian Peninsula was the home of three different cultures--Jewish, Christian and Muslim--that were often able to co-exist in relative peace.  While doing so, they were each able to contribute to a cosmopolitan and melded culture that for a long stretch was the most advanced culture in Western civilization, producing things that remain unique to this day.<br />This \\"culture of tolerance\\" as Menocal calls it was perhaps not as tolerant as she likes to make out and, of course, it ultimately implodes as Christians and Muslims fight for possession of the country.  Still, much of the literature, science and philosophy produced of that time remains influential and many of the beautiful places remain to be see by visitors to the area.  Anyone traveling to the country would be amiss if he or she did not take a look at this book and get a feel for the achievement of medieval Spain.<br />Understand that this book is a completely optimistic account of the period and ignores most of the tragedies of the time.  Still, in our time of insecurity, it is nice to read something positive.  It is beautiful to see what can be achieved when three powerful cultures work together instead of try to destroy each other.	2002-06-02
US	50946478	RAWSZAQEAZYBH	0385494238	654180128	Amsterdam	Books	4	15	17	N	N	Brief but Satisfying	There are lots of prizes given out around the world for achievement in fiction-writing.  Some offer insight as to the excellence of a book; others less so.  That said, I have yet to be disappointed with a novel that has won the Booker Prize.  It is, in my mind, one of the best indicators of achievement in fiction.  McEwan's novel is no exception.<br />This book opens at the funeral of Molly Lane where three of her former lovers cross paths.  All are now prominent men in British society with reputations to protect and power over the lives of others.  Due to some of the revelations of Molly's estate, the morality and friendship of these men is tested to an extreme which culminates in an ending in the city of Amsterdam which, if not a surprise, is certainly a beautiful piece of comedy and irony.<br />Though it suffers a bit from that common modern literary problem of brevity and predictability, this novel shines in its humor and character development.  Even in Booker Prize winners, it must be expected that quality varies.  This may not be my favorite of past winners, but it is certainly worth the time it takes to read it.	2002-06-02

Anyone with an interest in Anne Frank would be foolish not to read this.  Written by a real friend of Anne's (who is referred to in the diary as &quot;Jopie&quot;), we are offered something in this book that cannot be underestimated--a different point of view on some of the experiences Anne describes by someone who really experienced them with her.  Quotes from the diary are expanded upon and explained and some minor mysteries are resolved by the woman who, as a girl, was with Anne when these things happened.<br />Some readers might be disappointed that this book is so brief.  I, on the other hand, was sympathetic to Van Maarsen's shyness, desire for privacy and reticence to speak so as not to appear as someone taking advantage of Anne's fame.  In fact, I think this makes her book even more compelling.  Van Maarsen speaks strictly to things she knows and experiences.  She does not try to pad the book with her own personal details and agenda.  She seems to have written this book for us--the people interested in knowing more about Anne--and not for herself.<br />As the years pass, there is the growing risk that Anne will become so sainted as to go beyond reality.  Additionally, the readers of the diary often forget that we are hearing a story entirely from the perspective of a young girl.  This does not diminish Anne's achievement but I think it is important to keep in mind that Anne was a real person with faults as well as great talent.  Plaster saints do not inspire as well as true human beings in whom we can find a reflection of ourselves.  Van Maarsen reminds us of Anne's humanity by giving us a different point of view of Anne's experiences.  It is an invaluable resource.	2002-05-09

I had just seen Henry V so this title caught my eye.  A glance through the table of contents made me think this book might be a real eye-opener.  Unfortunately, I ended up being a bit disappointed.<br />Sutherland and Watts take turns addressing what they call different &quot;puzzles&quot; in various Shakespearean plays.  The problem is, except for the rare exception, most of these questions can be answered in various ways depending on how the play is performed.  For example, is Malvolio vengeful or reconciled at the end of Twelfth Night?  Or, does Bottom actually sleep with Titania in Midsummer Nights Dream?  In both cases the ultimate answer is, it depends on how you play it.  There is no one answer fixed in the text.<br />Even questions that seem like they should have a specific answer like, who killed Woodstock in Richard II?, are given waffling answers.  There's simply no way to know.  Again, the ultimate answer will lie in how the play is performed.  Different companies will lead their audience to different answers depending on what they decide to focus.<br />Ultimately, this book has value in the sense that it points out what some of the issues are with various plays.  On the other hand, the writing here is not very dynamic.  The authors rarely take a position and, when they do, they approach it so weakly that they do not inspire a response in the reader.  Perhaps the authors felt that they didn't want to provoke any controversy with their readers but, if they had, it might have made for a more readable book.	2002-04-19

As such, many readers are probably already familiar with this title.  I, however, had never seen it before.  As a Christian and a fan of Peanuts, I found it to be a very good book.<br />One of the reasons I think I like it is that, since it was written in 1968, it's not one of these wishy-washy new-age/ spirituality books that have become so common.  Someone looking for \\"inspiration\\" should look elsewhere.  This book is a serious theological tract that uses Peanuts cartoons to illustrate various points.  I found this to be a very clever approach with which Charles Schulz himself \\"could not be more pleased.\\"<br />I also like the fact that Short is not afraid to come out and say what he thinks.  He tackles the tough questions of Christianity and gives the answers he believes are true.  He doesn't try to sugar-coat the cross that a Christian is required to carry and he tries to make his way down to the very core of Christian belief.  This is a worthwhile task.<br />On the other hand, I did find Short to be a bit repetitive in his writing.  He hammers away his points over and over.  Additionally, I have to say that I'm not a believer in everything he has to say.  That, in and of itself, is fine with me.  People willing to state their convictions make me willing to examine my own more deeply.  This is something we all--even Mr. Short--need to do from time to time if we are to keep our faith strong.	2002-04-19

His skeptical attitude towards life is one I appreciate.  I am a little more sympathetic towards theological thought myself, perhaps, but his feelings about science reflect mine very closely.  His most important idea may be his ability to draw a line of demarcation between the requirements and goals of what constitutes scientific thought and those modes of thought that, while valuable, are clearly not scientific.  People need to understand that there are rules as to what makes an idea truly scientific and that many ideas are clearly unscientific despite the window-dressing.<br />Here Shermer expands his ideas of separation of church and science a little more closely by examining what he calls &quot;the borderlands of science.&quot;  He is trying to make a distinction between those things which are on the fringe but still good science and those things that are clearly not scientific.  It is a good distinction to make since, as Shermer points out, all revolutions in science were once &quot;fringe&quot; ideas.  I was particularly taken with his example concerning aliens (i.e. extra-terrestrial life).  Though there has never been a UFO encounter with a solid basis in fact (taking all of these &quot;experiences&quot; beyond the realm of science), SETI is science, albeit science on the fringe.<br />It is in his discussions of individual scientists where Shermer oversteps himself a bit.  He tries to give us a picture of the type of mind it takes to be open to fringe ideas and still be scientifically oriented.  It is a worthwhile idea and he has interesting things to say about scientists like Darwin.  However, I found his use of the &quot;five factor personality inventory&quot; to be disturbing close to various types of pointless psychology and not very revealing.  I also found his dominant interest in Stephen Jay Gould, Alfred Russel Wallace and Carl Sagan to get a bit boring after awhile.<br />Still, Shermer is clearly a very careful thinker with important things to say.  I appreciate his support of the scientific ideal and his attempts to separate scientific modes of thought from other types of knowledge.  Unfortunately, the people who most need to read this, probably will not and, even if they did, would be close-minded to his points.  For the open-minded, there is much to gain from this book.  There are many things here to chew over in your mind.  I might point you to some of Shermer's other books first (Why People Believe Weird Things and How We Believe) which are better than this one but The Borderlands of Science remains a worthwhile read.hinker with important things to say.

Though I didn't find this novel quite to the level of her first, there is still much to enjoy here.<br />Look at Me focuses on the tensions between how a person is seen, how a person wants to be seen (or not) and what that person really is.  Egan attempts to illustrate this tension in four characters that would seem to qualify as main characters.  There are two Charlotte's--one a fashion model who has to re-evaluate her life after a car crash changes her face and the other a teenage girl trying to discover herself.  There is Michael West/ Z, the terrorist/ club owner/ math teacher/ movie director who never reveals himself to anyone.  Finally, there is Moose, the jock turned Ivy league professor turned mentally unstable historian who once was the most popular man around and is now alone with his own strange ideas.<br />The characters in this novel are very strong and there are a number of minor characters that also add to the flavor of the book.  In particular, Irene Maitlock and Anthony Halliday.  If I have any dissatisfactions with this book it is that I didn't find the brief Part Three to be a satisfying conclusion.  I have a lot of lingering questions about most of these characters that were not answered well, in my opinion.<br />But I'm willing to live with this flaw.  I have to admit that I was especially attracted to this book because it is set in Rockford, Illinois, and New York City.  I am originally from a small Illinois city not too far from Rockford and I now live across the Hudson from New York.  I was also fascinated by the appearance of this interesting terrorist character.  This book was published in October 2001 so I doubt he could have been added after 9/11 but it was an interesting stroke of luck that allowed Egan to present this interesting character at this appropriate time.<br />This book may not be a masterpiece but it is a good read nevertheless.nevertheless.	2002-04-16

Then I read his book They Whisper and enjoyed it.  Then, for some reason, I lost track of him.  I didn't read anything else of his until I came across this novel, Fair Warning.<br />The main enjoyment of this novel comes from a character study in the form of its protagonist, Amy Dickerson.  She is an auctioneer for a small but prestigious Manhattan auction house.  She has a natural ability to read and understand people which makes her very good at her job.  She is able to see what people are willing to part with in terms of both money and objects.  On the other hand, this ability interferes with her relationships both with her family and her potential lovers.  While longing for the ethereal herself, she can only see people's material wants and that includes a person's desire for her.  In the end, she must try to see her own desires most clearly and come to peace with them.<br />This is a nice little book.  Butler's prose is quite engaging and the book is short enough to be read at a single sitting.  Amy and her relationships do make for a fun glimpse into an upper class New York/Paris world.  I was tripped up a bit at the end by Alain's neo-Naked Pictures of My Ex-Girlfriends obsession which seemed a bit of a cheap ruse in an otherwise very emotionally realistic novel.  Still, it is certainly worth the time.	2002-04-06

Norwich did a much better job of going through the history and, in particular, of comparing the history to Shakespeare's plays.  Plus, Norwich's writing was much more vivid and engaging.<br />On the other hand, Saccio does a very good job of going through the history of Shakespeare's kings in a logical manner.  He does not waste words and presents a story that is quick and easy to digest.  Like Norwich, Saccio focuses mainly on the kings from Richard II through Henrys IV, V, and VI to Richard III.  Unlike Norwich, however, Saccio also discusses King John and Henry VIII.<br />For anyone who is interested in knowing what really went on in the lives of these Shakespearean kings, this book is an excellent tool.  Saccio points out some of the most important fallacies in the plays and is fair in presenting honest assessments of the realities of these characters even when they conflict with the dynamic images drawn by the Bard.  This second edition also has a nice afterward that comments on some of the Shakespearean scholarship of the past 25 years.  It is a worthwhile read.	2002-04-05

He's not afraid to ask the tough questions about the cornerstones of faith and he's open to a wide variety of possibilities both traditional and liberal.  He has a deft hand and obvious faith but his writing lacks the undercurrents (and, often, overtones) of other writers who ram particular points of view down a reader's throat.  He is the kind of writer who gets the wheels in your head turning.<br />This time out Kirsch looks at the biblical figure of King David.  He examines what we know of a man who is in many ways the key figure of the Bible.  For those of us focused mainly on the New Testament, we need to be reminded that David was the pinnacle of Jewish success and the cornerstone of Messianic thought.  It is no coincidence that Matthew and Luke are careful to trace the genealogy of Jesus through David.  And Kirsch makes a very interesting case that it is possible that the books that carry the story of David (1 & 2 Samuel) may be among the oldest in the Bible around which even much of the Torah may have had its development.<br />Certainly, Kirsch reminds us of how very human David is.  He is a virile youth and a successful warrior both for and against his countrymen.  He is an anointed shepherd who takes years to secure a kingdom which he eventually must defend against his own sons.  He is a servant of Yahweh who breaks nearly all the commandments at one time or another but repents.  He is a believer but is steeped in pagan ritual and tradition who ultimately is not allowed to build a temple to his God.  In the oldest stories, David gives us a glimpse of a people and religion that is trying to make itself into the Judaism we recognize but is still finding its way despite Abraham and Moses.<br />Ultimately, Kirsch leads us to an understanding of David and his time by fleshing out details and offering explanations for things that get short shrift in the Biblical text.  Whether or not you accept all of Kirsch's possibilities, this book is a valuable resource for anyone who wants a clearer picture of the Old Testament world.Kirsch's possibilities, this book is a valuable resource for anyone who wants a clearer picture of the Old Testament world.	2002-04-05

In it, Robert Ehrlich looks at a number of scientific hypotheses that have on some level become ingrained into the public consciousness as &quot;fact&quot; and considers the possibility that different hypotheses might be possible.  At the risk of sounding &quot;crazy,&quot; Ehrlich tries to open our eyes a bit.<br />For example, many people would probably agree that sun exposure causes skin cancer.  Ehrlich points out, however, that sun exposure has been shown to be quite beneficial on the whole.  Though there is a risk involved, for the vast majority of people the benefits quite outweigh any potential harm.<br />He covers a number of topics such as these and, even though I try to keep up with what is current in science, I found a number of interesting surprises here.  I was particularly interested in the chapter describing how it is very likely that oil and natural gas are not fossil fuels and may be much more abundant that we previously thought.  I also found the chapter on the possibility of our solar system having two suns to be quite an eye-opener.<br />Unfortunately, I found Ehrlich's abilities as a writer to be a bit lacking.  His prose is very uneven and often unnecessarily dense.  Though I found most of his topics to be quite exciting, some chapters came across as quite boring.  In the hands of a better writer this book could have been magnificent; instead, it feels rather average.<br />Still, as a science teacher, I try to stress that science is a field of hypothesis rather than a field of fact and this book illustrates that point very nicely.  It reminds us that we must keep an open mind to a wide variety of hypotheses to solve scientific questions.  Additionally, Ehrlich shows us that we cannot be open to just any hypothesis.  All hypotheses must be held up to the same scientific rigor.  Imagination and flights of fancy often lead to exciting new ideas but they must be able to be supported by data.  This is the heart of what science is and is something of which even working scientists must be reminded from time to time.t of what science is and is something of which even working scientists must be reminded from time to time.	2002-02-19

Some very good science books do their best to communicate with a general audience concerning ideas that can be highly technical.  What is rarer is a science book that does both of these within the framework of what it is really like to live and work as a scientist.  The amazing book The Double Helix by James Watson which describes the quest for the structure of DNA is one of these.  So is this book by Alan Guth on the development of the inflationary universe theory as a &quot;correction&quot; to Big Bang theory.<br />In this book Guth takes us through the basics of the Big Bang theory and then into the idea of inflation--what it is and how it goes along with Big Bang theory.  He takes a wonderful historically-developed approach and he does this without the help of (at least as far as I can recall) a single equation in the body of the text.  Instead, he uses basic numerical analysis and the help of a number of graphs and illustrations to develop these complex ideas into a very readable explanation.  He is also very frank in warning the reader of difficult concepts and directing the less detail-minded to skipping around.<br />All of this makes for a good science read; however, what I really enjoyed about this book is how he brings out the things that really drive real science, particularly when he reaches those investigations into which he was personally involved.  He points out how theory and experiment drive each other.  He isn't afraid to show the fights for priority and reputation that often push scientists.  He lets us see how the desperation for a secure job, the cockiness of the young researcher and the ego of established names is often the engine for discovery.<br />Anyone interested in the current state of research into the origins of our universe would be remiss in not reading this book.  Many people get the gist of Big Bang theory but fewer understand what Big Bang theory is really about and fewer still understand why the inflationary universe has become so important in recent years.  This book will clear away all the fog; in particular, Guth is very clear in explaining the problems with Big Bang theory (the horizon problem, magnetic monopoles, etc.) that are cleared-up with the inflation approach.<br />More than this, however, the reader will gain real insight into what it is like to be a working scientist.  It offers a peak at its excitements and disappoints, even a glimpse at the clashes and in-fighting.  Many people often get the idea that science makes grand pronouncements of fact from on high.  This book shows that science is, in reality, a continuing struggle for a more and more accurate picture of our universe and how it works.

Books like A.S. Byatt's Possession and Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose are probably two of the gems of this genre.  And I wouldn't hesitate to put Perez-Reverte's The Club Dumas near the top of a &quot;best of&quot; list either.  In fact, Perez-Reverte specializes in this field with other worthy titles such as The Flanders Panel and The Seville Communion.  Now, he adds The Nautical Chart.<br />Basically, this novel is a treasure hunt centering around the attempt to locate a sunken Jesuit ship lost off the coast of Spain in 1767.  Coy, a grounded sailor, is lured into the hunt by--whom else?--a beautiful woman who believes she can find the ship using the ancient titular chart.  Of course, there is competition to reach the lost ship which leads our narrator through most of the adventures in this novel.<br />Like all of his novels, this one is very well-written, plunging us into a vanished world our modern characters need to understand before they can achieve their desires.  There are always things to learn when reading a Perez-Reverte novel and they are always fun to read.  But there is something missing in this book that Perez-Reverte usually provides:  surprises.<br />Though intellectually stimulating, this novel is very predictable.  On some level, I think Perez-Reverte realizes this and plays it off in Coy's own foreshadowing of his ultimate fate.  Still, he has shown himself to be capable of much more in his other novels.	2002-02-11

I can predict where a novel is going very early on and I often have the movie's killer worked out before it's half over.  I enjoy having this skill but I've learned it's wise not to whisper the ending to your friend at the seat next to you when you're at the theatre.<br />In any case, nothing makes me happier than coming across a novel that offers me real surprises; unfortunately, I didn't find too many surprises here.  This does not mean this is a bad book.  On the contrary, I find it to be a very enjoyable first novel.  But it is a novel that has more joys in the experience of the prose and the unfolding of its intricacies than in shocking revelations.<br />This book traces the story of two groups of girls at an isolated boarding school.  Twenty years earlier there had been the tragic deaths of two girls at the school as well as one of the girl's brother.  Now, that tragic history seems to be repeating itself in another group of students when the surviving girl comes back to teach at the school.  Ultimately, it's up to Jane Hudson--the student turned teaching linking the two stories--to figure out exactly what is going on and to avert any further deaths, including her own.<br />Though others might find the denouncement more shocking than me, I found the brilliance of this book in the details.  In particular, as a former private school teacher myself, I think the early depictions of the teaching life to be right on target.  Also, there is a wealth of beautiful description here of both people and places.  If you enjoy a well-written mystery/thriller then, all in all, this first novel is well worth a look.	2002-02-11

Previously, I have read his book on Moses and The Harlot by the Side of the Road.  I find his books to be intriguing, informative and entertaining.  Very few books on religious subjects can be described by all three of these terms.  But Kirsch has a non-pretentious style that draws the reader in and makes it easier to consider some of the astounding things he brings out.<br />Without beating you over the head with it, Kirsch is clearly writing from a Jewish perspective.  As a Christian, I find Kirsch's books great background for what is the basis of Christian theology.  In this book, he takes for his theme the changing shape of Judaism over the millennia.  He points out how many sects of modern Judaism try to enforce a traditional religion based on the ancient practices of the Jewish people, forgetting that one of the hallmarks of the Jewish faith is how it has been able to adapt over the years and ensure the survival of both faith and people.  All religions could take to heart the idea developed in this book; namely that, despite what hard-liners want to believe, religious practice evolves through time in any religion.  Jews and Christians alike should search harder for what is right as opposed to falling back on what we've always done because it's what we've always done.<br />Kirsch offers many wonderful stories and descriptions in this book but one of my favorites is the one that is referenced in the title of the book.  What happened to the days when human beings weren't afraid to question God and God wasn't offended to be questioned?  Sarah laughs at God's promise of a son, Abraham debates with God over the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and Moses doubts and questions the burning bush.  And these are just a few examples of challenges from people beloved by God.  But these days the thought of questioning religious leaders, let alone God himself, are beyond the pale.  Has this weakened us spiritually?  I don't know the answer but it's one of the many questions inspired by this book.<br />Over time, I have come to the conclusion that books on religion are the best to read and the hardest to review.  The reviewer is almost certainly to offend someone who holds passionate beliefs contrary to the author and/or the review.  There is no way around this and I am sorry for it because I have no wish to offend anyone.  Yet, as a person who doesn't have all the answers but considers himself to be in a state of constant exploration for the Truth, I enjoy reading nearly anything on philosophy and theology.  I think any religious explorer with an open mind would enjoy this book.ut it's one of the many questions inspired by this book.<br />Over time, I have come to the conclusion that books on religion are the best to read and the hardest to review.

As a boy who grew up on one of those stops down the train line from Chicago, I felt a real connection to the story told in this book.  Of course, unlike Joey, I didn't just spend the summers in the small Illinois town downstate.  I lived my life there and didn't take the train upto Chicago until I was 17 and headed for college.  Still, Peck has certainly caught the flavor of small town Illinois.<br />The bulk of this book takes place over the summers from 1929 to 1935.  And yet, it's amazing how much of those attitudes depicted in this novel still survive.  My grandmother grew up during the Depression and much of the quirkiness and toughness balanced by family feeling shown in the character of Grandma Dowdel I remember in my own grandmother.  That's what makes Grandma Dowdel such a wonderful and realistic character.<br />And yet, there is also a glimpse of history here.  Many things from the 1930's--some good and some bad--are gone now and it's fun to travel back in time through the pages of this book.  I don't know if kids today are effected much by stories of the past. The flashiness of twenty-first century culture is stiff competition to a story no matter how well-told but I certainly enjoyed this book.  The best \\"childrens' books\\" can be read and enjoyed by adults but I hope there are some younger readers out there who give this book a try.  It will take you to a place that is sadly disappearing from the American landscape.	2002-01-27

Books	5	14	15	N	Y	Put Simply--I Laughed	What can I say?  Dennis Miller makes me laugh.  His rambling monologues filled with pretentiousness and profanity make me laugh.  He has a sharp, critical eye (which he's not afraid to turn on himself) and I often, though not always, agree with what he has to say.  You take comedy with a grain of salt, realizing that its easy to take shots and less easy to come up with real solutions to the world's problems.<br />I sometimes hesitate to give a book like this a really high rating.  Will this book change the world?  No.  Will it be read a year from now let alone 100 years from now?  Probably not.  And yet, this book made me laugh out loud more than anything I've read in recent months.  It made me laugh more than I remember laughing at Miller's earlier rants.

Now, I, being a physicist and teacher myself, actually read the book when it came out and enjoyed it immensely, though I admit it has its flaws.  His new book has many of the same strengths and flaws.<br />There is no doubt that Hawking loves his work and it is always fun to read someone who gets that love across in their writing.  He covers a number of inherently fascinating topics--the birth of the universe, black holes, time travel, etc.--and offers reasonable explanations of these phenomena.  This book also has the advantage of being beautifully made and offering much more in the way of illustrations than A Brief History of Time does to help visualize the difficult concepts he is describing.  It is in some ways a coffee table book of cutting edge physics.<br />On the other hand, the concepts described are difficult and no number of illustrations is going to change that.  Hawking himself says he tried to write a simpler book this time but he only partially succeeds.  Most of the world has a difficult time grasping Einstein's four dimensional spacetime let alone higher dimensional spaces, flexible time and branes.<br />Additionally, though Hawking always gives credit where credit is due, he's not above tooting his own horn and a current of arrogance runs through his text.  The explanations he offers are his own and he often seems close-minded to other ideas.  Not that I'm against this, per se.  As I tell my students, confidence in the fact that you can get the right answer is a main ingredient of genius.  It keeps someone like Hawking working through his unique ideas to their conclusion.  Without that confidence, no new and world-changing thoughts would find their way to us.  Still, it can be off-putting and some readers might not realize there are other theories out there.<br />Ultimately, however, this is a book worth reading.  Particularly if you like science and you can open your mind to multi-dimensional spaces.

I first read Jim Crace with his book Quarantine and I also read Being Dead--a very good book.  This book, however, is the best of the lot.  Yes, it is brief but its language is beautiful and its themes varied.  It is at times funny, thought-provoking, poignant and always lovely.<br />It is not, in fact, a novel but rather 64 short vignettes.  As the title implies, the connecting theme throughout the stories is the appearance of food in one way or another.  I had thought that I might point out what some of the better vignettes are but they are all so good and they are so varied that I can't pick just a few to discuss without denigrating others without reason.<br />This is a very short book that can easily be read in one sitting so give it a try.  Then, once you've read it once, go back and read it again, bit by bit.  It's worth it.	2001-11-16

Fortunately, it is a good one.  Certainly, smallpox is a threat and Tucker does a good job of giving us a realistic view of that threat.  On the other hand, despite the focus on the &quot;once and future threat of smallpox,&quot; I found the best part of this book to be uplifting.  Specifically, the eradication of smallpox from the world.<br />Smallpox remains the only disease that has been completely eliminated from the human race through human action.  It is difficult for many of us to remember what a horror smallpox was and how it killed and disfigured huge numbers of people around the world.  Its defeat is an amazing accomplishment of which we should be proud and one which may never be repeated.  The story of the development of the various vaccines and the quest to destroy smallpox is a fascinating one that shows what people can achieve when differences are put aside in reaching a common goal.<br />Today, smallpox only survives in the laboratory and, as Tucker reminds us, some of these strains have  likely been weaponized.  At this point such a weapon would be devastating since we no longer vaccinate against the disease.  Additionally, we do not have enough vaccine stockpiles to control an outbreak should a smallpox weapon be used.  This is a well-timed warning and one we should take to heart; however, I hope we also take to heart the reminder of our power to do good with our science.	2001-11-12

Now that the issue of bioterrorism and biowarfare is a front page issue, I decided to give it another read.  Though not as compelling as some books on the dangers of unchecked plagues devastating the world (Richard Preston's The Hot Zone is still one of the scariest books I've ever read--fact or fiction), it focuses specifically on the use of biological agents as weapons.  In this respect, it is an eye-opener.<br />Alibek was one of the key leaders and scientists in the Soviet Union's biological weapons.  Until he defected in 1992, little was know in this country about the extent of the Soviet program--a program that was supposed to be dismantled by treaty agreement in the early 1970's.  Alibek made us aware of how advanced the Soviet program was.  And he warns us that Russia still works on advancing their program despite claims to the contrary.<br />Certainly this is a frightening prospect, especially in light of recent events in this country.  Though I do not personally consider Russia a threat, it is painfully clear that Russian technology is leaving Russia and falling into the hands of people who are not afraid to use it.  One of the things I like most about Alibek's book is that he gives tremendous insight into the Russian mentality.  How even he, as a high-level soldier in the Soviet military, was brainwashed into believing the United States had an extensive bioweapons program.  (I am not naive enough to think our program is non-existent despite treaty agreements but it certainly does not compare to the Russian production machine.)  Additionally, he points out that in the trying economic times of post-communist Russia, anything and everything is up for sale.<br />I am not easily made paranoid.  I prefer knowledge and will not have my life altered by fear.  Despite the current anthrax scare, I am not afraid to open my mail or travel to Manhattan.  This book did not change any of that for me.  If you are a worry-wart, however, I would suggest you stay away from this book.

Guedj's book is a history of mathematics disguised inside a murder mystery.  It covers a lot of ground and is a lot of fun.<br />The basics of the story are this: Mr. Ruche, a octogenarian former Parisian bookseller, inherits a library of mathematics books from an old friend living in the Amazon who has died a mysterious death.  At the same time Max, a deaf child living with his family in Mr. Ruche's house, rescues a parrot from a Parisian market.  Mr. Ruche becomes convinced he can solve the mystery of murder and bird by using his new library to trace the history of mathematics from Euclid through Fermat and Goldbach.  I leave it to the reader to discover exactly what is accomplished by this tour of great mathematics.<br />One thing the reader will certainly discover is some insight into the development of mathematics.  As a math teacher I am constantly looking for books that might interest my students in the subject.  This book fits the bill.  It is somewhat slight and a bit narrow in its coverage of math's history but it does hit on a number of the big discoveries and issues.  As a novel, well...the fiction is really secondary to the math.  Still, it's a good read.	2001-10-28

Still, no matter how the literary may mourn (and I count myself as one of these), there is something to be said for the simple functionality of these twenty-six shapes that define the &quot;Roman&quot; alphabet.  As John Man reminds us, it is this concept of alphabet as a subset of writing--since writing can exist without an alphabet--that allowed civilization to develop in the way that it has.<br />As a teacher of math and science I have often given more thought to the development of number than I have to the development of the alphabet; and yet, both subjects are equally intriguing and important.  Both have contributed to the rise of our modern culture in different and important ways.  I am fascinated by many of the things that Man has to say about the development of these important symbols.  For example, it is interesting to think about how the leap was made from &quot;symbol as word&quot; to &quot;symbol as sound&quot; which is at the heart of the leap to the alphabet.  Then there is the paradigm-shift that has to take place as younger cultures appropriate the concept and develop it.  It is an incredible story.<br />And, for the most part, Man tells it well.  It seems a little brief at times but it is a good overview of a complex subject that is still advancing day by day.  Anyone interested in writing and language would be foolish not to take a look at this most readable book.	2001-10-15

I had never heard of this saint or his prophecies and I wanted to see if there is anything in them.  Supposedly given to a twelfth century Irish saint in a vision, this sequence of one-line prophecies is said to describe each successive pope from the Middle Ages through today.  Interest has been generated in these prophecies recently because there are only two left--meaning we are two popes away from Armageddon.<br />I am not a big believer in prophecy, neither its accuracy or its usefulness except in the general sense of reminding people to repent for their sins.  I am particularly wary of prophecies of the end of the world.  Not only have all predictions of the end of the world been thus far wrong (and there have been many) but also Jesus himself said, &quot;but of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father&quot; (Mark 13:32).  If the Father did not reveal the time of the Day of Judgement to his Son, I find it hard to believe that He has or plans on revealing it to anyone else until it is upon us.<br />This book did not do anything to change my feelings about the usefulness of accuracy of prophecy.  As always, these prophecies (usually consisting of no more than three or four words) are twisted into shape to fit the popes that have so far come along--sometimes referring to heraldry, the pope's name, his birthplace, the deeds of his life, etc.  If the prophecies had all referred to the same thing (such as heraldry), they would be much more convincing.  But so much happens in a person's life that it is easy to make a few words fit anyone's life and certainly these few phrases have no useful predictive power.<br />Here is where the book really falls flat.  In analyzing the two prophecies that have yet to be fulfilled, Hogue offers us numerous interpretations--almost none of which come even close to hitting the mark.  Writing in early 1998, Hogue was convinced John Paul II would be dead by 1999.  Well, it is late 2001 and the old man is still going strong.  None of what Hogue expected to be by this year has even remotely come to pass other than some general talk of floods, famines, wars, earthquakes, etc., which can fit almost any year in human history.<br />What this book seem mostly to be is an opportunity to criticize the past 1000 years of the papacy.  I have many criticisms of the papacy myself but this book is almost universally negative and, believe it or not, the papacy has generated some positive things in the world as well.  In analyzing the popes of the twentieth century Hogue is a little fairer but, in the end, the papacy suffers.  It's fun to wonder about the future but, all in all, I find this book to be useless beyond stirring the imagination a bit.  Not a bad thing, but not enough.in early 1998, Hogue was convinced John Paul II would be dead by 1999.  Well, it is late 2001 and the old man is still going strong.

This wonderful book is the story of the development of the OED. Now he has written a book on William Smith, the man who developed many of the ideas of rock stratification which laid the foundation for modern geology. The ultimate expression of Smith's genius was the production of the world's first geological map which gives this book its title.<br />Smith's story is a fascinating one and Winchester tells it well. Smith, a rural blacksmith's son, is orphaned and works his way up to being what in today's language we would call a civil engineer. As he works on the construction of coal mines and canals he see the strata of rock and collects fossils, coming to the understanding that the relationship between these things tells us about the age of the rock layers. This concept will have far-reaching repercussions in science.<br />Winchester also tells us of Smith's struggles to get his work recognized in a class-stratified world of gentleman-scholar-scientists. Along the way, Smith overextends himself financially and finds himself in debtors' prison. After that, he and his reputation seem to fade away only to be resurrected near the end of his life when he begins to reap some of the honors for his work in a field which has since passed him by.  Then he fades away again.<br />Winchester is beginning to make a habit of writing stories bringing to light forgotten people making important discoveries and doing important work that has changed our world. I hope it is a habit he continues. I am already looking forward to the next gem he digs up. He and Dava Sobel are a one-two punch of brilliant modern writing on scholars and scientists who deserve to be remembered.	2001-09-10

It is the story of young librarian, Alexander Short, caught up in a search for a timepiece to complete a collection owned by a wealthy eccentric, Henry James Jesson III.  Books, library searches, heraldry, theft, adventure and a wife who is constantly trying to seduce her husband.  Who could ask for more?<br />And, indeed, this is a fun little book.  I am particularly fond of the scenes set in the New York Public Library with its resources and its cast of interesting characters.  I also find the search for the timepiece to be an interesting one with plenty of twists and turns along the way.<br />My only complaint about this book is the payoff.  There really isn't one.  I found that the book just kind of fizzled out in the last few pages.  I have not read Kurzweil's first novel, A Case of Curiosities.  I wish I had.  I get the impression it might throw some light on this novel.  Still, as it is, it's a quick novel and well worth a read.	2001-09-10

A truly holy man, I was confirmed under his name.  And yet, his ideal of living a life of poverty and service is something I could never find the courage to emulate to any significant degree.  Still, it is heartening to read of his life.  In our modern world, we need all the inspiration we can find.  Adrian House has done a good job of using the life of Francis to provide inspiration for us.<br />One of the main things I like about House's work here is that he provides the story of man who is truly human.  I quickly tire of biographers who try to throw only good light on their subjects.  This is a particular danger when writing of a person many consider to be a saint.  Still, for saints to really inspire, to lead us towards the good, we must be able to see ourselves in them.  Like many great saints (Paul, Augustine, etc.), Francis lived the rather loose life of a wealthy young man for many years before the revelation that turned him into the man he became and House is not afraid to show us this.  Even better, House recounts instances of Francis losing his temper and making mistakes after his transformation but with the caveat that Francis, unlike most, always tried to make amends for his transgressions.  This, in my mind, is what is best about Francis.<br />The weakness of this book is that is caters a little too much to a modern, ecumenical audience.  Francis was a product of twelfth century Italy and we lose a sense of time with all the interspersed quotations from post-Middle Ages, multicultural sources which shed little light on the man Francis was.  I love to read Shakespeare, Buddha and the like, but not here.  This is somewhat a matter of taste, however.  I am already well-versed in the Christian milieu and, therefore, don't need help to connect to Francis.  Non-Christians may find this book more palatable because of House's style.<br />On the other hand, the only really modern writing I want to see is modern scholarship and, fortunately, there is that too.  House handles Francis's mystical side very well and I liked the way he points out how the Orders Francis founds get hijacked and turned away from Francis's ideal.  People like to criticize modern religions expression but we should take the time to look back at the original spirit of these groups and rituals before decide it has no value.

US	50946478	R1OVBRGMWFZHAK	0380973650	337033298	American Gods	Books	4	4	8	N	Y	Missing Gods	I have enjoyed reading Neil Gaiman for awhile now. I first read his Sandman comics and then I read his novel Neverwhere. Gaiman has a knack for coming up with extremely clever ideas of a mystical nature and carrying them off with energy and atmosphere. I looked forward to much of the same with this novel, American Gods. Though not quite up to the level of his previous stories, there is much to like here. As always with Gaiman, the idea here is very clever; namely, that when the settlers from the Old World settled America, they brought with them their various gods. Since a god's &quot;health&quot; is maintained by the amount of worship received, the Native American gods were overshadowed by a new pantheon. The thrust of this novel is that the Old World Gods--Odin, Loki, leprechauns, etc.--are being replaced by technological/consumer &quot;gods.&quot; (The television, for example, comes to life at one point.) But these old gods aren't going to go out without a fight. The story follows the adventures of a man named Shadow, a recently freed ex-con haunted (literally) by his recently deceased, cheating wife, who is hired by Wednesday, a creature Shadow slowly learns is a version of the god Odin. The two of them travel around gathering up the old gods into an army to battle the new gods. Needless to say, there are plenty of twists and turns leading to a surprise ending of sorts. There are problems here, however. One: the characters are interesting but only superficially. It is difficult to ultimately care about what happens to any of them with possibly a couple of exceptions. Two: the &quot;gods&quot; in question here are not any that most people would consider gods. The entire Judeo-Christian influence is pretty much ignored apart from some subtle imagery. I find it difficult to swallow a novel about American gods that ignores these influences. Still, the novel is a quick read and does present some ideas that are interesting to chew over. How dependent on worship is a god's power? What is the nature of sacred objects and sacred places? Is technology and consumerism taking over the role of religion in America? I just wish the characters had been a little more engaging and the story a little more energetic.d's power?

Many of them fall into one of two categories: the &quot;what if the Nazis had won the war?&quot; and all the rest.  In this first category are some brilliant novels such as Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle and Robert Harris's Fatherland.  Though perhaps not quite as good as these, The Children's War can be added to that list.<br />First off, at well over 1100 pages, this is not a novel for the weak-willed.  It is divided into three sections, however, so it really reads like three novels of about 400 pages each.  The reader should also be warned that the first section is the weakest part of the novel.  Once the second section begins, things really start to get interesting and remain at a good pitch throughout the rest of the book.  That's not to say that the first part doesn't have value but it mostly just introduces you to this modern world of a Nazi-conquered Europe: a cruel master race, subjugated populations (some enslaved and some &quot;ethnically cleansed&quot;), poverty and rebellion.  Okay, but pretty standard stuff.<br />In the second section, however, things start to cook.  Enough of the characters have been killed off so that there is a manageable cast and the Nazis become secondary.  In fact, the story narrows pretty much to a group of Polish rebels who take in a former English slave named Peter.  Peter is the character who, for the most part, drives the novel.  What makes these later parts more interesting is, first, the examination of what it is like to be a slave under totalitarianism.  Peter escapes at the end of part one and it is not until he is in (relative) freedom that we can see the deeper effects of slavery.<br />More interesting, however, is the examination of the rebels.  Most of them are young and have grown up knowing nothing but war and oppression.  What does this do to them?  Will they be capable of creating a reasonable society even if they do manage a victory over the Nazis?  Are they justified in the atrocities they commit to achieve their ends?  Much of this is brought out in a love story between Peter and a rebel named Zosia.  It is this examination of the psyches of these characters that make this novel better than the run-of-the-mill.  (If you can get past some of the amazing coincidences that allow major characters to interact in some unexpected ways.)<br />But it is difficult to describe such an involved novel in a few lines.  There are many interesting characters here both major (Richard, the Vogels) and minor (Tadek, Barbara).  There is a fascinating visit to America mid-novel that gives the chance for some sly commentary on our culture.

It shows extraordinary skill in melding together a number of diverse story lines, each of which is interesting in its own right.  It contains a number of interesting characters; in particular, Stanley and Zero as well as Sam and Kissin' Kate.<br />Unfortunately, there are certain things about this book that rub me the wrong way.  Mainly, I don't believe much of what happens in this novel could happen.  It pretends to be a realistic novel but a lot happens here which I don't find to be very real.  My main problem is that all of the action has a driving force of fate or destiny.  This kind of active destiny is just not something I believe in and so it interfered with my enjoyment of the book.<br />Don't misunderstand: this is a very good book and well worth the read.

It was a wonderful experience but I began thinking about the events depicted in these plays; namely, how historically accurate was what I saw?  This theme of historical accuracy in plays and movies has become rather popular lately, inspiring a number of books and documentaries.  In an attempt to answer this question for Shakespeare's history plays, I read this book, Shakespeare's Kings, by John Julius Norwich and I'm glad I did.<br />This is a very well-written and informative book.  In chapters alternating between history and the corresponding Shakespearean play, Norwich covers the period from Edward III through Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VI, Edward IV, Edward V to Richard III.  The history chapters are clear and concise considering the large number of people that populate them, and how they are often executed, banished and losing and gaining lands and titles.  Norwich is also quite good at offering different views on the period before settling on the view he feels is most substantiated.  He then follows the history with an examination of the appropriate play, explaining how events are telescoped and rearranged, how characters are sometimes mistaken and invented and how even history must suffer if drama is to be maintained.  I am particularly fond of the fact that Norwich doesn't let historical inaccuracies interfere with his appreciation of what a dramatist like Shakespeare needs to accomplish for a successful play.  History and drama are not the same.<br />I was also interested to see a discussion of the play Edward III which, according to some scholars, is a recent addition to the Shakespearean canon.  I had not heard of this play before nor its attribution of authorship to Shakespeare but it is listed as part new edition of the New Cambridge Shakespeare, for one.  I was very glad to discover this so I could look into the matter.  It is nice to see an author comment on the most current scholarship, however we might ultimately feel about the conclusions.<br />A final note worth mentioning to the interested reader: this book only deals with the history of the two major tetralogies.  It does not cover the &quot;fictional&quot; histories (like King Lear, Macbeth, etc.) nor with the English histories out of sequence (King John, King Henry VIII).

My experience with Africa amounts to a day spent in Morocco at the turn of the century as a chaperone to a group of students.  I loved the experience but many of the students were uncomfortable.  I think this was because the culture there is so very different from anything most Americans ever experience in their lives.  I am amazed at how well Bowles is able to bring to life this land and culture in his novel.<br />Interwoven with his portrait of this desert culture is the story of a couple, Port and Kit, who are traveling through the region with a friend named Tunner.  Port and Kit are the main characters here.  They are a pair of well-off Westerners who travel with no itinerary or time limit.  They indulge themselves not only in the pleasures of the places they travel but also in their knowledge of the other's nature.  They desire closeness with each other but create distance in their denial of their own knowledge and wants.  They try to escape in their travels but they have arrived in a land that will force them by its harshness and beauty to look more closely at themselves.  They are incredibly interesting characters who undergo very moving tragedies.<br />On top of that there are a number of wonderfully drawn minor characters in this novel.  Besides Tunner, there is the horrible and yet comic mother/son pair, the Lyle's.  There is the sick French commander, Lieutenant d'Armagnac, as an example of a man who has made his peace with Africa and enjoys it.  There is the Jewish merchant, Daoud Zozeph, as well as Belqassim who adds Kit to his harem of three other wives.  All of these, and more, populate the novel with intriguing takes on what it is to survive in this world.  I recommend this novel to anyone.<br />A final note for fans of the band The Police and their album Synchronisity.  The song &quot;Tea on the Sahara&quot; from this album is drawn from this novel.

It is a subject of which I am very fond.  And yet, even though we call the subject Euclidean geometry, very few people, even those of us who teach it, have a clear idea of what exactly it was that Euclid did.  We might use the compass and straightedge occasionally but not with Euclid's methodology.  I think that this is too bad.<br />Over the course of the past year or so, I have made it a quest to prove the propositions of The Elements in Euclid's style.  Thus far (and at a leisurely pace), I have made it through the first two books outlined in this volume.  It has been a wonderful experience that has deepened my knowledge of this subject and, hopefully, has made me a better teacher of it to my students.  I am looking forward to going through the remaining eleven books of the last two volumes.<br />Some things of which a reader should be aware: this volume only contains Euclid's first two books which, in and of themselves, are not very long; however, this volume also contains 150 pages of introduction and significant commentary on nearly every definition, postulate and proposition by Sir Thomas L. Heath.  I found much of this very enlightening and was glad to have it included.  Still, this material could easily be a stumbling block for weaker students and people interested in Euclid alone.  Heath's notes are very detailed and assume a knowledge of certain things (such as classical languages) that are not a common part of the modern curriculum.  But, remember, this commentary was written nearly 100 years ago.  Don't let it stand in your way.  It can be a bonus but, if you have trouble connecting with it, skip it.  The notes and commentary should be considered gravy for the prime component here: Euclid's text.<br />There has never been a writer of mathematics as successful as Euclid.  For well over 2000 years the work that Euclid did in compiling The Elements has been the crowning achievement of geometry and it has only been in the twentieth century that his book has been replaced by other texts.  There are good reasons for this but, on another level, it is sad that his genius is being diluted.  Anyone with a decent handle on high school geometry could get a lot from Euclid himself.  The propositions would be familiar and anyone truly interested in understanding how mathematics has become the powerful tool it is today would be remiss in not reading Euclid.nd it has only been in the twentieth century that his book has been replaced by other texts.

This book won the Newbery Medal in 1998.  I have read nearly all of the Newbery winners and my rule of thumb for these (unlike some other, less worthy prizes) is that you can expect to read a very good book.  This one is no exception.  Of course, not even Newbery winners are all created equal.  Some are truly great and some are kind of average.  This one falls in the middle of this range--let's call it the &quot;not quite truly great&quot; category.<br />Let me say first off that I personally found this to be a wonderful book.  I think it is interesting and moving.  Though not generally a fan of the free verse/prose poem style Hesse uses in this &quot;novel,&quot; I found that her words generated an emotional response that straight prose might have lessened.  I was also surprised by how detailed this world became for me while reading what is a very sparse book.  This shows real talent and stylistic strength.<br />On the other hand, though I believe strongly that the best books for children and young adults are equally readable by adults, sometimes an author shoots a little high for the primary readership.  Hesse's book is wonderful for adults but a little difficult for younger readers.  I was able to let myself be carried away by the beauty of this book because I already have a strong sense about the Depression, life on a farm, the Dust Bowl.  A child, however, will struggle with this book because, though strong on feeling, it's short on background.<br />This is not to say that this book is without merit even for younger readers.  Its style and emotion are worth a read for anyone, particularly since it is short enough to be read in very little time.  In combination with a more historically oriented book or other background on the Depression, a young reader could get even more from this book.  Without this, though, many younger readers will struggle with this book.	2001-07-30

Time after time he has impressed me with his interesting and readable accounts of subjects ranging from The Making of the Atomic Bomb to Why They Kill.  In Deadly Feasts, Rhodes has once again written a wonderful book.<br />In the late 1990's there was a slew of books published on the subject of disease and the possibilities of biological warfare thanks in no small part to Richard Preston's magnificent The Hot Zone.  In The Hot Zone Preston writes with an almost fictional intensity about a class of viruses that kill in a quick and horrifying fashion.  It was The Hot Zone that brought Ebola to the public consciousness.  Rhodes' book, too, is about killer illnesses but of a different type.  The Hot Zone presents us with what are, despite their horribleness, rather exotic diseases.  Deadly Feasts presents us relentlessly fatal diseases that might very well already be infiltrating our Western population through that most dangerous source--our food supply.<br />Rhodes' book presents the links between a disease called kuru which was passed through the women and children in aboriginal tribes in New Guinea and a rare disease that Westerners may be picking up through, you guessed it, the so-called &quot;mad-cow disease.&quot;  Kuru was transferred by human cannibalism and the disease was eliminated by stopping this practice.  Mad-cow disease is passed by the &quot;cannibalism&quot; of cows by humans.<br />Preston's book is highly intense because of the visible horror of the symptoms he describes and the speed with which victims are overcome.  Rhodes' book has an intensity that builds as he describes the progression of diseases that may need decades to incubate in humans before they show symptoms that will whittle them down over the course of months to fatality.  The horror that Rhodes describes is of diseases which are 100% fatal that some of us here in the West may have already contracted but will not see signs of for many years.  And we have contracted it through eating tainted meat.<br />But Rhodes' book is about more than the horror of disease and the dangers of our food supply. Deadly Feasts is about real science.  Not the science that scientists and historians like to present to us that lull people into thinking science is a perfect, logical progression.  Rhodes shows us science for what it is: investigation and guesswork, supported by experiment and influenced by politics and the personalities of scientists.  Mistakes are made as well as reputations.  Egos play a role.  Wild ideas make their way into fact and, at this point, still no one knows whether these diseases are caused by something virus-like or a new &quot;killer protein.&quot; As a science teacher, I can't help but like this book a lot.<br />I've heard some people say that this book turned them into a vegetarian.  Well, it didn't do that to me but, then again, I'm not the type.  What it did do was make me appreciate Richard Rhodes' skill as a writer once again.

His portrayal of Autolycus is relaxed and engaging--a campy performance for a campy pair of shows.  Then I began to realize that I'd seen him in a number of other shows: Lois &amp; Clark, The X-Files, and Army of Darkness to name a few.  I became a fan.  When I saw this book sitting on the shelf, I couldn't resist taking a look at it.  I'm glad I did.<br />I enjoy reading stories of the movie and TV business.  In particular, I like autobiographies by people involved in the business.  Obviously, you rarely get the whole truth (when do you?--even with the best biographers) but there's something about getting stories from the source that can be a lot of fun.  Until now, I'd mostly read autobiographies by more &quot;high-brow&quot; actors (Brando, Hepburn, O'Toole) but I have a great fondness for B-movies.  I grew up watching the old science fiction B-movies in particular and I loved them.  It is nice to see someone involved in the process who isn't embarrassed by it and loves the kitsch he's in.<br />And this book is fun, too.  It's a quick read--definitely worth the little bit of time it takes to get through it.  There's plenty of pictures and funny stories.  I also found his stories about how a group of boys from the Midwest raised their own money to make movies very interesting.  If you have a soft spot for B-movies like I do, I suggest you give this book a chance.	2001-07-25

The main reason is because she has written a truly great book--&quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot;--and a number of others that are nearly as great.  Because of this, there is a tendency to be a tougher judge of her books as if every new novel should be a masterpiece.  Fortunately, Ms. Paterson lives up to the challenge time after time.<br />I am constantly amazed at how well Ms. Paterson is able to write in the voice of young person, creating very realistic characters.  Though a bit older myself these days, I can identify very well with Robbie as he stuggles with the difficulties in his life.  I am particularly impressed with the depiction of Robbie's relationship with his father and how he struggles to understand him.  Also, the difficulties he has in being himself while at the same time trying to be the son of a good man who has an important and public job in his hometown.<br />Though I don't think any good book is really gender-specific to an active reader, I can see where young boys would find this book speaking to them a little more.  Still, I would encourage anyone with a love of good literature to read this book.  It is a stong depiction of an interesting character.	2001-07-20

Some people love to scribble in books.  Of course, there are those who are stridently against it.  Jackson, in the first attempt at a coherent view of the subject that I've seen, tries to show that there can be value in peoples reaction to the printed word in the context of marginalia as opposed to other methods (such as taking notes, etc.).<br />I just wish Jackson's book had been more coherent.  I have no arguement with many of the points Jackson is trying to make.  I find myself, as someone who &quot;creates&quot; marginalia in some of my books, reflected in many things she says.  I, too, generally on write in books of non-fiction on subjects in which I feel I have some knowledge.  I, too, as a book collector, came to writing marginalia late and still make it a point to keep many of my books in pristine condition because of that.  Jackson obviously has a well-researched view of her subject.<br />On the other hand, I was somewhat disappointed in her skills as a writer.  There is an incoherence to some of the things that she does in this book.  She has nice coverage of different types of marginalia and speculates on some of the reasons that people write marginalia which are nicely done, but she includes discussions and digressions on book alterations that she even admits are technically not marginalia.<br />Also, she spends a lot of time in her last chapter considering whether writing marginalia in books is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; when it clearly is not either.  It is simply a matter of personal choice.  I write marginalia in my books because I want to, the books are mine and I have no intention of getting rid of my books.  On the other hand, I almost never buy books that already have marginalia in them.  I want a pristine page for my own comments.  Am I damaging my books or reducing their value?  That depends on some future buyer and is not something I consider.  I am increasing their value to myself.  Perhaps my marginalia will have an interest to some future scholar.  Perhaps my books will end up in the trash bin.  But I won't be around to see it and I certainly don't feel there is any right or wrong to it.<br />What makes more sense is Jackson's arguement that books with marginalia should be better catalogued and more valued in scholarship.  I do believe there are things to learn from marginalia for history in general and the history of reading, a subject which is becoming more popular these days.<br />This is a good book to read for anyone interested in books or the history of reading.  If there were a number of books out there on this subject I would probably have rated this book lower because I don't find it particularly well-written.  I would also suggest that people read Boswell's Life of Johnson before they read this because she spends a lot of time talking about this book.  However, I have given this book some extra-credit for being a good first attempt that will hopefully generate more interest and better scholarship in the subject.some future buyer and is not something I consider.

Both of these towns would be familiar to anyone aquainted with Mormon history.  Every time I drove past the Gardner Museum as a boy I remember seeing one the Sunstones from the original Mormon temple sitting out in the yard.  I remember the wonderful television commercials that used to air all the time making some kind of moral point and finishing with the tag line &quot;from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints--the Mormons.&quot;  I remember meeting a number of Mormons around town and in occasional trips to Nauvoo.  I always remember thinking &quot;what nice people.&quot;<br />As I grew up, I learned quite a lot about theology.  Though I've never felt the desire to leave my own church, my experience as a boy got me quite interested in Mormonism as a religious system.  I've always wondered how people who were so strongly ethical could rationalize a theology that is often strange and inconsistent.  Reading this book was a great help in clarifying some of my thoughts and experiences.<br />The reason this book is so well done for a person with an intellectual bent towards religion is that it is balanced.  The Ostlings are do not come across as either pro- or anti-Mormon.  They present the information they have gathered and judge certain things about the Mormons positive and certain things negative.<br />Many of their judgements mesh well with my own experiences with Mormonism.  For example, they point out the strong family values that Mormons have as well as their incredible willingness to help others, particularly, though not exclusively, other Mormons.  In fact, they have well-organized systems of relief for those who are suffering.  Better, perhaps, than almost any other religion.  In addition, they have a culture of service to their church that outstrips many others.<br />On the other hand, despite the protests of many Mormon scholars, Mormon theology is clearly a break from any traditional understanding of Christianity.  They have a system of revelation which, though not a problem in principle, makes for inconsistent theological development with which it can be difficult to deal.  (I've never understood why people would believe that God spoke to prophets thousands of years ago but wouldn't now. Still, any prophet, I think, would have to meet a certain muster to be accepted by a large population.)  Additionally, Mormons are clearly secretive and very conservative which causes a lot of tension not only with other religions but also with disenfranchised groups within their church.<br />All of these aspects and more are clearly and deeply covered by the Ostlings in their book.  Anyone with any interest in Mormons or Mormonism would be well-advised to read this book.  It is a fair account not influenced too deeply by either side.rom any traditional understanding of Christianity.

Books	5	30	33	N	N	Magnificent Look at Shakespeare &amp; the Concept of Purgatory	I happened to be browsing through books the other day (as I am often wont to do) when the cover of this book caught my eye.  It is detail from a painting by Hieronymus Bosch who happens to be one of my favorite painters.  Then, when I saw the book was about Shakespeare, Hamlet and the concept of Purgatory, I was sold.<br />Of course, need I mention the cliche about judging books by their covers and so on?  There was no guarantee that I was going to like this book despite my attraction to its superficial accouterments.  Still, sometimes you get lucky.  This is a wonderful book.<br />As a Catholic, the concept of Purgatory is an integral part of what I was taught about the afterlife.  It was very interesting to see how the Christian view of the nature of Purgatory changed through time and how that view influenced (or, what is more likely, was influenced by) the literature of the Middle Ages.  Greenblatt examines a number of ballads and other pieces from as early as the 11th &amp; 12th centuries to show the change of Purgatory from a relatively restful place of waiting into a vicious hell with a time limit.<br />By Shakespeare's time, of course, the Protestant Reformation had taken issue with the many abuses of the Church with respect to Purgatory (particularly indulgences) and all but eliminated Purgatory as part of the revised dogma.  Still, as Greenblatt points out, the concept and the human feelings it addresses with respect to the afterlife cannot be eliminated by religious pronouncement.  It finds its way into many of Shakespeare's plays in various guises.  The spirits and ghosts that populate many of the plays are an instance as is the mention of chantries and &quot;poor in yearly pay&quot; of Henry V to name but a few.  The clearest and highest development, however, is the appearance of the ghost in Hamlet.<br />Greenblatt develops his ideas about the ghost in Hamlet in the last chapter of the book but this is just the peak of a wonderfully perceptive analysis of this aspect of influences on English literature.  Anyone with any interest in the development of religion, the development of early English literature and/or Shakespeare should definitely take a look at this book.of this aspect of influences on English literature.

He tries to give us a look at the entirety of twentieth century thought.  Still, though there are bound to be omissions and inaccuracies in such a book, Watson succeeds admirably in giving us a taste of the intellectual achievements of the past 100 years.<br />There is so much I like about this book.  I like the fact that he sticks to his purpose.  He stays away from the wars and politics that dominate most histories and focuses on scientific, literary, artistic and other intellectual achievements.  Not that I have no interest in our political history but it is nice to be able to give some consideration to what is often best in humankind--the achievements of the mind.<br />Also, this is a very well-written book.  It is long, but broken up into easily digestible segments with important names and concepts highlighted.  Reading too much at one sitting can lead to information overload but in short gulps this book can really educate.  I am amazed at the breadth of knowledge Watson displays in this book.  I, for one, felt that I gained a lot of insight into things of which I already had some knowledge and, in addition, picked up many new things.<br />Of course, a book like this with such a large scope can be by no means complete.  On the other hand, it achieved something that is rare and that I enjoy very much while reading--it lead me to new people, new ideas and new books to read.  I was encouraged to track down and read a handful of titles that I might never have come across without reading this book.<br />A final warning: if you are a fan of Freud and psychoanalysis, you will not like this book.  Watson does discuss the subject quite a lot (as he should, considering the influence Freud and his successors have had); however, he is not a fan and comes down rather hard on the field.  Fortunately, I feel much the same way as Watson and was glad to read such a well-articulated position on the subject.<br />Not that such a position matters much to me anyway.  Everyone has a right to a well-argued position and, agree or disagree, it is worth learning.  All in all, anyone with a desire to broaden the range of his or her thinking will find some enjoyment in this book.  I might not always agree with Watson's conclusions but it really got the wheels in my mind turning.br />Not that such a position matters much to me anyway.

US	50946478	R3GRVVSFSHU5AS	0399147454	559108275	The Muse Asylum	Books	5	20	20	N	N	Brilliant First Novel	Every year, I make it a point to read a few first novels.  I think it is important to support our literary future.  Usually, the first novels I read are good but not particularly special.  Here is an exception--David Czuchlewski has written a truly wonderful novel, first novel or no.<br />In this novel, Czuchlewski tells the story of the search for a very reclusive writer named Horace Jacob Little.  The search is carried on by a two young men--Jake Burnett, a young writer for a newspaper, and Andrew Wallace, who is certain Horace Jacob Little is out to get him.  This lands the brilliant, though unstable, Wallace in the &quot;muse asylum&quot; of the title.  The link between these two young men is Lara, the girl with whom they are both in love.<br />Needless to say, I don't want to give away any of the twists and turns of this novel.  Let me just say that the writing here is wonderful.  The characters are clearly drawn and, in Andrew, I found one of the most realistic depictions of madness in recent years.  The plot is clever and Czuchlewski sustains the tension throughout the book.  I am usually very good at predicting how novels will end but this one surprised me to the last pages.  I was especially glad that Czuchlewski opted for what I would call a &quot;realistic&quot; ending when I was fully prepared to accept the bizarre to the point of the supernatural.  Instead, I believed that everything I read could happen.<br />Even though it's not a particularly long book (and I dislike this trend towards superficial haste in modern novels), it is a deep and solid whole.  It is a quick read but better than the typical thriller.  I must admit, I'm already looking forward to novel number two.	2001-06-19

Since then, I have read just about every book she has written and I have never been disappointed.  L'Engle is one of the most consistent writers of high quality books that is out there.<br />I'm a little past the age of the target audience for this book but it is a fun little book that older siblings of new babies are sure to enjoy.  This was in my mind as my brother and his wife had their second child a few weeks ago.  In this book, the family dog has to deal with feelings of jealously at the arrival of a new baby in the house.  It is a cute and humorous little story told from the dog's point of view.  If you need a gift so that an older sibling doesn't feel left out when the new baby arrives, this is a good choice.	2001-06-17

I enjoy his novels quite a lot (such as Vox and Fermata).  They are unique and clever which is something I really appreciate; however, I'm not sure I read them because I really like the stories.  Instead, I read them because Baker is a writer whose talent jumps out at me from the page.  His writing is beautifully constructed and his passion about his ideas and characters is clear in his dynamic style.  Whether or not you like his stories or his thoughts is secondary--he makes you feel something when you read him.  I love the jolt of energy I get and I love the way my mind churns when I read something of Baker's.<br />I certainly got a jolt of energy from Double Fold.  In it, Baker describes the destruction of the physical content of many of our nation's libraries in an effort to conserve space.  Volumes of old newspapers and countless &quot;brittle&quot; books have had their contents transferred to microfilm.  Supporters of this process claim this is necessary to save the intellectual content of paper products that are literally crumbling away.  Baker argues, however, that, in most cases, this imminent loss of old books and newspapers is hype.  Paper products such as books and newspapers have a longer life than is usually assumed and the &quot;tests&quot; of their strength (such as the test that gives this book its title) are often arbitrary and poorly designed.<br />Baker also points out the loss of quality that often accompanies the transfer to microfilm.  If the effort truly is to save intellectual content, then that effort is often a failure.  Many volumes of newsprint that was to be transferred to microfilm never made it and many volumes more are so poorly filmed as to be illegible.  Additionally, as the film ages, the quality is reduced even more rapidly than an equivalent aging in the original paper.  Many films that were once readable are quickly becoming garbage.  With no originals from which to replace the film.<br />Here is where Baker's argument really struck home with me.  When these &quot;delicate&quot; paper products are reduced to film, the original books and newspapers are destroyed.  Not only are they sliced and diced during filming to make that process easier, the remains are thrown out.  I never dreamed that when I sat at my hometown public library and scanned through old issues of the Quincy Herald-Whig and its predecessors on microfilm, that, somewhere, the old, physical, paper issues weren't still around.  Maybe Quincy is lucky and someone has saved the old volumes somewhere but it seems unlikely.  In my mind, that is a sad loss.<br />I guess this is why this particular book of Baker's moved me more than anything else he's written so far.  In this particular passion, I am on Baker's side.  I love books and newspapers.  Not just their intellectual content but the objects themselves.  I live in an apartment surrounded by thousands of books and newspapers, many of which are very old and in great shape.  And, you know what?  If I could get them all magically transferred to microfilm or CDROM and be guaranteed that all of their intellectual content could be saved, I wouldn't do it.  There is a quality to the object itself that has value and is worth saving.  I am a book collector.<br />While I was reading this book a friend of mine saw me and asked what the book is about.  When I told her she said, &quot;A whole book about that?&quot;  Yes.  If you have any interest in books, newspapers or libraries, I suggest strongly that you read this book.  It is well-written, passionate and, though there is no question where Baker's sympathies lie, he presents both sides of the story. You will learn a lot and, if you are anything like me, wish you had Baker's passion and resources to start a non-for-profit company and buy up some of these things to save them from destruction.

If you can, go to see the show before it closes.  If you can't, buy this book and get a glimpse at the power of a photograph.<br />Though no expert, I enjoy the art of photography.  I am particularly interested in portraits of real people.  Mary Ellen Mark has the ability to capture people with extra-ordinary depth and feeling.  Almost without fail, her images are moving.  With a skill beyond the normal artist, however, her images have the ability to be thought-provoking.<br />Consider a photo labelled &quot;Aryan Nations, Hayden Lake, Idaho, 1986.&quot;  Three pleasant-looking, smiling women--the cherubic face of the woman on the far right particularly draws the eye--set in counterpoint to their white supremacist garb.  Or consider the series of photographs of Tiny who has clearly experienced many things in her life but who face, amazingly, holds the same soul in each image.  Or consider the contrast between the photographs of Julie d'Aquili and Cynthia Galves despite their similar poses.  Julie is a healthy young woman but her somber expression stands out starkly against the cancer-ridden Cynthia who still manages a smile.<br />I believe that I could write something about every single photograph in this collection.  Let me instead just say that these photographs will grip you and hold your attention for hours.  You will come back to them again and again.  And, unlike reproductions of paintings in a book, photographs do not suffer from the process nearly as much.  I would encourage anyone with an interest in photography to take a look at this book.	2001-06-10

This genre has produced great non-fiction (&quot;A Gentle Madness&quot; by Nicholas Basbanas leaps to mind) and great fiction (such as &quot;The Club Dumas&quot; by Arturo Perez-Reverte).  Ross King has produced a novel that is not among the best in the genre but it isn't bad.<br />This is a novel that tells two parallel stories: First, of a London bookseller in 1660, Isaac Inchbold, who is charged with tracking down a rare manuscript.  Second, of Emilia, a lady-in-waiting to the young Queen of Bohemia in 1620, who flees the destruction of Prague with the treasure-trove of books from Prague Castle.<br />Of the two, the secondary story of Emilia is the more interesting of the two.  Hearing a bit of Prague in its glory days took me back to a recent visit I made to the city and brought it to life for me again.  Also, Emilia comes off as a sometimes bewildered but ultimately intelligent and together young woman.  On the other hand, I found Inchbold to be rather uninteresting.  He seems to be intelligent but allows himself to be easily manipulated and rather slow on the uptake.  I found myself rather irritated with this character who is supposed to be our guide through this story and who allows himself to almost completely controlled by rather obvious means.  Fortunately, this novel is also peopled by quite a few interesting minor characters such as Inchbold's apprentice, Monk; Biddulph, the old Navy historian; and Appleyard, the blind clerk in the deeds' crypt.<br />Unfortunately, I'm not quite sure the culmination of the novel is really worth the effort it takes to get there.  There are some interesting revelations concerning the book that is the object of everyone's interest but the end in rather anticlimactic.  Still, this novel is an easy read and there's some interesting things here.  All in all, it's not a bad way to spend an afternoon.	2001-06-02

With that as his starting point, in this &quot;biography of the world's most famous equation&quot; Bodanis takes us through the background of each element of the equation (E,=,m,c and ^2) and leads us through their union by Einstein in 1905.  Then he takes us through some of the implications this equation has had for the twentieth century, including the development of the atomic bomb and the discovery of black holes.<br />All in all, Bodanis does a fine job with his book.  His presentation is easy enough to follow so that nearly anyone should be able to get the basics here.  Additionally, the story, as he tells it, is motivated historically which is something that I really like.  We meet a number of the important figures in scientific history (including the important women, two of whom get a lot of time in this volume--Emile du Chatelet and Lise Meitner) and learn about their contributions to the development of the theory.<br />The main weakness of this volume is that it is also too simplistic.  It serves as a great introduction for the scientifically challenged but there is very little depth here.  (To someone who has read Richard Rhodes' brilliant &quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot; this lack of depth in certain areas will stand out.)  Also, Bodanis' judgement of certain figures--Heisenberg and Hahn, in particular--is rather harsh.  I may even agree with his assessment but people's lives, especially in times of war, are more complicated that can be summed up in a few negative lines.<br />Still, Bodanis has done a fine job here.  I would encourage anyone with an interest in science to take a look at this book, especially those who think that something like relativity theory is beyond their basic understanding.  This book will show them that they can learn this stuff.  And when you're ready to handle more, Bodanis has given us extensive notes and a bibliography from which to move on to something higher.s and a bibliography from which to move on to something higher.	2001-05-21

Thank heaven!  Michael Frayn's &quot;Copenhagen&quot; is magnificent.  Then there are two plays produced by the Manhattan Theater Club:  &quot;An Experiment with an Air Pump&quot; by Shelagh Stephenson and this play, &quot;Proof&quot; by David Auburn.  I think both are wonderful.<br />After winning the Pulitzer, a shot at a Tony, and a continuing run on Broadway, Auburn really has no need for my good words; however, let me give a few anyway.  This is a cleverly written piece.  Unlike &quot;Copenhagen,&quot; this play really isn't about mathematicians and scientists.  It is just framed around them.  No math skills are necessary to enjoy this play.  Instead, it is an examination of love, trust, madness and genius presented through the lives of mathematicians.<br />In fact, the only weakness in this play is when real mathematics comes up.  I cringed when I heard the famous exchange between mathematicians G.H. Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan put in the mouth of Robert and Catherine, the father/daughter mathematicians at the heart of this play.  It just rubbed me the wrong way.<br />Fortunately, this is the only time math actually comes up.  Instead, this play takes us into the lives of four very interesting people.  I was fortunate enough to see a performance of this play on its second night on Broadway.  I was incredibly moved.  Mary-Louise Parker's performance as Catherine was particularly impressive.  Reading the script, I was carried right back to the theater and could relive the experience again.  I loved it.	2001-05-21

It could certainly be argued that it is the most influential medical epidemic in Western history.  The effect of plague on the course of history has been a popular subject for historians in this age of advanced bio-medicine.  There are a number of good books out there on the subject.  I had hoped this would be one but, unfortunately, it is not everything I'd hoped it would be.<br />Clearly Mr. Cantor knows his subject.  He makes a number of interesting points.  I was particularly interested in his evidence that the Plague may have been more than just an outbreak of bubonic plague, as is often assumed.  In fact, it may have been a combination of bubonic plague and anthrax (or something similar).  This would account for the devestation to cattle as well as humans and the fact that many who succumbed to the Plague did not display the outward signs of bubonic plague.<br />Mr. Cantor also takes on the influence the Plague had on subsequent history.  He describes the devestation that the loss of such a large percentage of the population had on the economy and politics.  He illustrates his points largely through anecdotes which mainly come from well-documented English sources.  Chapter 3, Bordeaux is Burning, is a good example.  In it, Cantor relates the crucial story of the death of King Edward III's daughter, Princess Joan, as she travelled to Spain to marry Pedro, the heir to the throne of Castile.  This stillborn effort to unite the thrones of England and Spain had incredible repercussions.<br />On the other hand, I found some of Cantor's &quot;subjective&quot; comments to be blatant and off-putting.  It is understood, of course, that no author can be completely objective.  I find it often enjoyable, in fact, to read historians who wrote in the days before &quot;objectivity&quot; was considered desirable and revel in their propagnada; however, I expect more from modern professional historians.<br />I sense that Cantor may have been consciously trying to write in a looser style in this book.  Perhaps he is trying to emulate a more entertaining lecture-style he uses with students at NYU.  It's a risk, though.  Especially when your reader doesn't agree with your assessment.  For example, he writes of &quot;the huge ugly palace the popes built&quot; in Avignon and &quot;the monstrous pile&quot; of Cologne Cathedral.  I have been to both of those places and found them both to be interesting and beautiful.  I was also disturbed by his disdain for Avignon as a city and the unneeded comment about St. John the Divine in New York during his discussion of Cologne.  These kinds of comments kept me from a better enjoyment of his anecdotes.<br />Addtionally, this is a brief book with more repetition than is necessary.  I got the feeling as I neared the end that he was streching to fulfill a minimum word requirement.

How can a writer, no matter how talented, really claim to understand someone well enough to give an overview of his life?  When the subject is a genius like Kurt Godel, whose name is known by few and whose work is really understood by even less, the job must be even more difficult.  Fortunately, people like Mr. Dawson are will to give it a shot and he succeeds fairly well.<br />In putting together this biography, Mr. Dawson has the advantage of being mathematician.  Additionally, he has the advantage of being the mathematician who catalogued Godel's papers after his death.  This gives him a lot of insight into Godel that other writers cannot have and he weaves quotations from these papers into the biography very well.  Mr. Dawson's is a well-documented and logical biography that is short on conjecture and long on footnotes.  In brief, it is a biography about a mathematician clearly written by a mathematician.  This is both its strength and its weakness.<br />Actually, I like the purely biographical sections of this book very much.  The biographical information is clear and informative, though a bit dry in the academic style favored by mathematicians and scientists.  Fortunately, having lived and worked among these people, I am comfortable with this style.  More importantly, I feel like I have a better idea now of who Godel was and what he was like from reading this book.  His focus on his work, his relationship with his family and friends (particularly his wife) and his ultimate decent into mental illness are much more in focus for me now.<br />On the other hand, the sections that deal with Godel's mathematics are much more difficult to take.  The discussion of mathematics in this book goes far beyond what most people are going to be able to handle.  I fear the average reader even with a decent math background who comes across this book will drop it as soon as the mathematics starts and that is unfortunate. (I am always looking for books to promote math even among non-mathematicians.  This one does not do it.)  A reader who can handle the math, however, will find this book revealing.ooking for books to promote math even among non-mathematicians.  This one does not do it.)

This books offers that in spades.  In fact, it is one of the best basic overviews of the field I have ever come across.<br />Mlodinow divides the history of the development of geometry into five major &quot;revolutions.&quot;  Starting first with Euclid and his Greek contemporaries, Mlodinow traces the field through Descartes and the development of analytic geometry, Gauss and the development of &quot;non-Euclidean&quot; geometries, Einstein and the physical application of these geometries, to Witten and the development of string theory--the attempt to understand the universe as a consequence of geometry.  In high school we teach the basics of plane and analytic geometry but few people are aware of how the field has matured since then.  This book takes us on that journey.<br />And it is a wonderful one.  Along the way he gives insight not only into the mathematics but also into the personalities that created it.  We too often forget that it is people who created this magnificent structure and that it was not just handed down to us perfectly formed.  Even more, we need to be reminded that the development continues and people are still contributing to it.<br />The real achievement of this book, however, is its acessiblity.  Despite the fact that most people will only have experience with the material from the first two sections of the book (Euclid and Descartes), Mlodinow's writing is understandable by anyone who has successfully navigated a course in high school geometry.  In my view, he offers one of the most lucid explanations of Einstein's work and string theory that I have ever read.  His style is engaging and very readable.  The ability to bring the importance of mathematics to a general audience is a great gift that Mlodinow seems to have.  I hope he continues to exploit it.<br />If I have a complaint about this book, it is that it could have used a few more diagrams to help the less mathematically minded visualize his explanations.  This is a minor point, however.  Overall, this book is a great piece of work.complaint about this book, it is that it could have used a few more diagrams to help the less mathematically minded visualize his explanations.

Well, if you believe Morris Berman, the answer is &quot;soon.&quot;  I don't know if I believe Berman or not, and he himself admits that there is no way to predict the future, but he certainly gives some compelling reasons why he thinks we are living in &quot;the twilight of American culture.&quot;<br />As Berman reminds us, empires fail and superpowers fade.  This is the way of history.  Babylonia, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Spain, France, England--they have all been world powers that have faded.  There is no reason to think that the United States will be any different.  To believe so is the height of ego for which Americans are proud and for which the rest of the world reviles us.  But world powers leave a legacy both good and bad and empires can last for a long time.  What will the American legacy be and how much longer can we last?<br />To make his argument, Berman makes great use of the old metaphor of comparing the United States to the Roman Empire.  Certainly, there are striking similarities.  The wide division between rich and poor and the existence of fringe groups both near and far from the core (i.e. minorities in the US and the Third World) is clearly a problem.  Additionally, one doesn't have to reach too far to see the homoginization of our entertainments and their tendency towards sex and violence as a &quot;bread and circuses&quot; opiate for our population.<br />As an educator, however, I found his comments on &quot;rapidly dropping levels of literacy, critical understanding, and general intellectual awareness&quot; to be most on the mark.  And the most troubling.  Every day I see mediocrity masquerading as excellence in our schools and people who try to promote excellence either put down as uncaring and &quot;elitist.&quot;  People in this country cringe at the terms communist and socialist but it is the heart of what is worst about communism when underachievers are rewarded equally with the excellent because we don't want to damage their fragile self esteem.  We are creating a generation of people in this country who are proud of their ignorance.  This is certainly something to be feared.<br />Ultimately, however, Berman is not overly pessimistic.  This is something I like about this book.  He believes our culture can be saved and that American culutre can rebound as civilizations have done before us.  He extends the Roman Empire metaphor into a method of saving what is great about our culture.  He calls it the &quot;monastic option.&quot;  Using the monks in their scriptoriums who saved the Greco-Roman culture from extinction as a starting point, he suggests that in modern times it will be aware individuals who will carry the best of American culture through the dark times ahead.  It will unlikely be a religious undertaking as it was before but it will be the few who again will save the history of the many.<br />I don't know if Berman is right about the future.  Berman himself gives various scenarios for what may happen.  Besides, talking of the future can never be anything more than conjecture.  Still, I like what he has to say.  Much of what he says about the present is right on the mark.  I also like that, despite the problems with American culture, he recognizes that there are things about it which are worth saving.  This is certainly true.  But only those people willing to open there eyes about what is both good and bad about our world will be in a position to save it.  Read this book.  You don't have to agree with everything in it but it will give you something to think about.<br />&quot;The word twilight, after all, implies an eventual dawn, and at some point we ae going to emerge from our contemporary twilight and future darkness, if only because no historical configuration is the end of history.&quot;--Morris Bermanally with the excellent because we don't want to damage their fragile self esteem.

This time around it was this book, Spain: A History.<br />Oxford University Press can usually be counted on to put out a good product and this book is no exception.  It is a nice coverage of the very complex past of Spain from pre-history to the present.  It is edited by Raymond Carr but the individual chapters were written by different authors.  Carr himself covers only the period from 1833-1931.<br />Ironically, it is Carr's section that I find the weakest of the book.  He wanders through so many different names and governments that I became a bit lost.  This is one of the main dangers about writing of Spain's recent past, I guess, since it seems that the leadership often changed minute by minute.  Still, the earlier sections of the book are much more engaging.<br />Overall, I found this book to be a good read.  It is quite detailed but still rather brief.  Sometimes these histories tend to get lost over a thousand pages or so.  This book can be read in a reasonalbe amount of time.  I was also pleased to see how the importance of regionalism in Spain is brought out.  For anyone interested in getting the big picture of Spanish history, this is a book for you.	2001-04-08

Fortunately, this one has all the earmarks of the best in the field.  It is clever and funny with an engaging narrator, odd characters and plenty of twists and turns.  It's a quick read and a fun way to spend an afternoon.<br />I originally picked it up because the narrator is a funeral director and I come from a family three generations into the business.  Having spent plenty of time in the environment, I thought it would be fun to see a little excitement added to the profession.  Of course, this was a mistake.  It was fun but there were things that just didn't ring true.  Fortunately, Sewell's work is only incidental to the story.<br />Other than that (apart from language that got a little flowery on occasion), I had a good time with this novel.  I'm interested to see how the characters develop in future novels.	2001-04-06

I have a special place in my heart for novels about mathematicians and this is a good one.<br />However, the mathematician in me requires that I be objective.  As a novel, it is slight.  There is not a lot of plot here and depth of character is rather limited.  For the average person looking for something to read of an afternoon, this is perhaps not the best choice.<br />On the other hand, anyone who wants a glimpse inside of the mathematical mind will find a good look here.  Additionally, you will find insight not only into the mind of mathematical genius (the standard in books about mathematicians) but also into the mind of the rest of us--we mathematical Salieris who wish for the genius but can only admire it in others.  This is a worthwhile insight that is not often found in books about mathematicians.  In the characters of Petros and his nephew, the narrator of the tale, we find the two major categories of mathematician and, in the story of Petros' attempt to prove on of the great unsolved problems of mathematics, we get a wonderful tour through many of the famous personalities and problems of 20th century mathematics.<br />For someone interested in mathematics and mathematicians this is a fun book and short enough to be read in a sitting.  For the non-mathematician who wants to know a bit about the passions of mathematicians, this is a good book as well.  For anyone else, I'd suggest you find something else.	2001-03-31

It traces the lives of a number of different characters but, even though they age as the book progresses, the day is the same.  It is an interesting structure but I don't see that it adds a lot to the story.<br />Additionally, there are many things that are hard to pin down.  Beard is constantly giving lists of possibilities.  For example &quot;somewhere in the Kingdom, in Quarndon or Northampton or Newry or York, in Kirkcaldy or Yeovil or Lincoln or Neath&quot; runs part of the first sentence of the novel.  A couple paragraphs later it's &quot;somewhere in the Kingdom, in Harlow or Widnes or Swansea or Ayr, in Reading or Glentoran or Nantwich or Hull.&quot;  This is followed by many more place-name lists.  And he doesn't just do this with places.  We're given possible advertisements, sporting events, magazines, TV shows, and on and on with the lists.  I found this to be very irritating after awhile and started breezing through these lists to get to the meat of the story.<br />And Beard does have something interesting to say here.  He is saying something about how people tend to look for a sign to help them know whether they are living right rather than making decisions for themselves.  Everybody in this novel is looking for a conversion experience (like Paul's on the road to Damascus--hence, the title) to know with absolute certainty that what they've chosen is the perfect thing.  Of course, this leads these characters to empty lives.<br />And herein lies the main problem with this novel for me--the characters.  They are somewhat interesting but mostly unlikable and then, in the last few pages of the novel, they all change.  They all somehow overcome their inhibitions and do the right thing for themselves.  The potential serial killer realizes his problems, the boy and girl overcome their fears and get together, and the man trapped indoors by panic attacks can go outside.  Perhaps they all had the conversion experience they needed but I couldn't buy it.  They just didn't seem like real people.ll had the conversion experience they needed but I couldn't buy it.

I like to believe that my own faith is strengthened when I am forced to think and examine my personal theology.  Good novels are a place to explore these things because they put a human face on what we often treat abstractly, if we think about these things at all.  This is a really good novel.<br />Angels have gone through a revival in the past decade or so but I've found most of this material to be uninspiring.  Here, however, is an angel story to get the wheels turning.  This story of a vitner who meets an angel one night and they agree to meet on the same night every year is wonderful.  Knox's imaginings of God, Satan, and the angel Xas offer interesting insights into the nature of good and evil.  The human, Sobran, whom Xas meets annually offers us insights into religion and faith and what it is to be human.  The relationship between Xas and Sobran takes both of them (and us) beyond their traditional roles in the hierarchy of creation.<br />I think this book hit me at just the right time.  It's fascinating but its exciting and easy to read.  I read the entire novel in a sitting.  Certainly outside the mainstream in terms of traditional belief about angels, it's not for everyone.  But for those who like to explore outside the theological box, it's good reading.	2001-03-18

What marks does a person leave behind when he or she is gone?  What is the meaning of these marks?  These are the questions that Saramago explores in All the Names.<br />This is the story of a aging, low-level clerk in the Registrar's office.  After decades of doing his work perfectly and invisibly, Senhor Jose begins to track the lives of famous people using newspapers and, more importantly, the information at the Registrar's office as sources.  While uncovering information about some famous person, he accidentally pulls out the information card on a woman who is not famous and he begins to track her down.  In fact, he becomes obsessed with tracking her down--ultimately discovering that her life seems in its own way to be as empty as his.  And that he loves her.<br />This is a short novel filled with ironies.  In tracking down this woman, Senhor Jose realizes how empty his life has been and yet his search gives meaning to his life.  In fact, his search begins to cause all kinds of changes in himself and in others around him.  In his search to create a real woman from a piece of paper in the Registrar's office, he creates himself instead and alters those with whom he comes in contact.<br />In All the Names, Saramago has written a strong and interesting novel.  If not quite up to the power of his novel Blindness, it is still good reading.  I am amazed at the effectiveness of Saramago style (at least as is comes across in translation).  His long paragraphs with limited punctuations containing entire conversations, including multiple characters thoughts and impressions are well done.  It is an interesting approach, especially to someone used to the traditions of direct quotation in written conversations so common in modern fiction.  The way his characters are not known by name but by who they are is fascinating.  (The only exception to this is Senhor Jose who is in many ways more faceless than characters without names.  Interesting.)  Saramago is definitely a unique stylist.  After Blindness and All the Names, I'm looking forward to going back and reading some of his older books.resting.)

On the other hand, if you like math, then there is a lot to like in this book.  And if you are currently in a calculus class--even if it's a required class--this book can help you make some sense out of what you're learning and put it in an historical context.  This book is certainly a better development of the most basic concepts than you'll find in many of those 1000+ page Calculus textbooks.  (Of course, it's just a conceptual development.  You'll find little in the way of technique and problem-solving.)<br />I think the main reason I enjoyed reading this book is because I enjoy math and it's clear that Berlinski does too.  It's always fun to read a book by someone who clearly enjoys what he is writing about.  And he's structured the book well, giving the conceptual developments of the subject as they were ispired by the attempts to solve particular historical problems.  He's also given us a taste of the personalities (Newton, Leibnitz, Cauchy, Riemann, etc.) who moved the subject forward, a look at what appears to be insights from his own experience as a teacher of calculus and mathematician, and relagated the formal math to appendices.  This is a nicely done book.<br />My only complaint is that in his historical and classroom interludes, he gets almost a little flippant.  Maybe a little too &quot;fictional.&quot;  It's certainly fun and engaging to read these sections but I began to wonder what was real and what wasn't.  When he's talking about his students and colleagues who may or may not be real people this is fine but when he's reimagining important historical figures I began to wonder about accuracy.  As a lover of mathematical history, I found this disturbing.<br />This is a small complaint, however.  This is very worthwhile reading for someone who wants to understand why calculus was developed in the first place.why calculus was developed in the first place.	2001-03-03

There is biographical material, of course, but there are better biographies of Anne out there.  This is already a very slight book and Pressler has more on her mind than biography.  She is also interested in analyzing Anne's life and, in particular, her relationships with the people she knew.<br />Pressler is an &quot;expert on the life of Anne Frank&quot; so many of her observations clearly come from a solid basis in research.  Much of it seems to be coming from the Critical Edition of Anne's Diary and from Miep Gies' book, Anne Frank Remembered. (These are two excellent books I would read before reading this.)  Still, for someone who has already formed an idea about Anne some of Pressler's opinions can be disconcerting, particularly when it comes to her analysis of Anne's sexuality.<br />This does not mean Pressler's opinions are not worthwhile.  For someone truly interested in imagining a full picture of a real person, there is a lot of food for thought in this book whether you end up agreeing with Pressler or not.  However, this book goes beyond the simple hero-worship in which Anne's memory usually finds itself.<br />In my fairly wide reading on the subject of Anne's life, this book is unique in its attempt to understand Anne as a real person beyond the character she creates for herself in the Diary.  Since this is an impossible task, all attempts are somehow tinged with futility, especially for someone who never knew Anne in life (unlike Gies and van Maarsen, for example).  This casts a pall over this book which Pressler, unlike some highly talented biographers, does not quite have the ability to overcome.  However, this book could be very important in opening up the field for a future analysis that may be better.	2001-02-24

This story of a world ravaged by a &quot;white blindness&quot; is incredibly well-written and insightful.  While reading this, I was reminded of one of my favorite books, Albert Camus' The Plague.  Saramago's book, however, goes a step beyond.<br />In The Plague, Camus creates a group of people quarantined in their city because of an infectious and deadly disease.  Saramago creates a group of people quarantined in an abandoned insane asylum because of what seems to be a transmitted but decidedly--and here's the point--non-fatal blindness.  In both novels, how those quarantined deal with their situations on a personal level as well as how they organize themselves and treat each other is the issue.  Interestingly, in Saramago's novel, the only deaths come from others and not from the disease itself.<br />Again in both novels we also see how those who on some level stand outside the disaster react.  In Blindness it is the doctor's wife (names are unknown in this novel) who remains as the only sighted person in a sightless world.  Despite being the only true witness to the horrors of this world, she somehow retains pieces of her humanity and helps those around her retain theirs.<br />I cannot say enough about the excellence of this novel.  The choice of a unique blindness for the threat in this story was very smart since it is not deadly but, additionally, puts aside the issue of attempting to cure it since the doctors do not have the eyes to examine the &quot;disease.&quot;  The cross-section of characters gives wonderful insights into people and the encounters both inside and outside of the quaratine are believable and intersting.<br />But I don't want to say too much.  Readers should experience this for themselves.	2001-02-20

I think it is very important for Catholics to be aware of both the good and bad in the Church, especially if we want our Church to survive and thrive in the next millenium.  This book certainly reminds us of some important background of some of the most important theological controversies of the last century--the nature of Mary, religious celebacy, women priests, and contaception to name a few.<br />Most importantly, the book is framed around the issue of papal infallibility and how that is part of what Willis calls &quot;stuctures of deceit&quot; within the Church.  Most Catholics are unaware of such a simple fact as that papal infallibility has been part of the Church for only about 150 years.  And yet this issue alone has allowed stands to be taken by the Church that prop up Church decisions that could be changed.  All of us in the Catholic Church need to be more open to the fact that our Church has changed and grown over the course of two millenia and, if we aren't careful, the Church will stagnate in an unhistorical conservatism.<br />The problem with this book is that it is relentless in its examination of the negative.  For someone like myself, whose faith is not shaken by a look at the negatives in the Church, this is not a problem.  But it gives a lot of ammunition to people who are anti-Catholic and could very easily shake the faith of those whose belief is not strong.  For this reason, I considered rating the book with only 3 stars.<br />Ultimately, I settled on four stars.  I think this book is important and well done but it is not for the unwary or hateful.	2001-02-20

Told in alternating points of view from Dominique, the interpreter of the title, and Nicholas, an Italian doctor living in NYC who has made a serendipitous discovery while researching luekemia, this novel is an interesting character study of two lives that come together.  Both Dominique and Nicholas are wonderful, well-developed characters who tell their own back stories as well as their individual reactions as their lives begin to intertwine.<br />One of the main reasons I think this novel works so well is that both Dominique and Nicholas are interesting individually and their love story is just icing on the cake.  This look at the world of interpreting is fascinating as is the insights into the ethically tricky world of medical research.<br />My only disappointment with this novel is how it winds up.  My friends tell me I have an uncanny ability to predict the endings of novels well in advance and this one was no exception.  I saw how this one was going to wrap up during Dominique and Nicholas's first conversation in the Frick Collection.  I couldn't quite swallow the drama of their break-up after the sensitivity of their coming together and I wished for a few more surprises at the end (I even saw that they would miss each other in Paris because of the 7-day mix-up) but 30 pages of predictablity is a small price to pay for nearly 300 pages of brilliance.  Besides, their relationship ended how I wanted it to end.	2001-01-30

It achieves the one major thing that I think a book like this must achieve: it is thought-provoking.  If people on both sides of the believer vs. athiest, science vs. religion would give this book a chance, eyes would be opened.  Of course, what are the chances of that?<br />I am a scientist and a Christian.  I am a teacher of math and physics with a firm faith in God.  I am comfortable with who I am.  How did that come about?  I can see my own path but it is interesting to read about some of the sociological and psychological paths of faith-development.<br />I also like Shermer's stress on the difference between the techniques of science and processes of faith--something which I often comment on myself.  Why do theologians (and, more often, pseudo-theologians) feel the need to apply scientific rigor to matter of faith?  Conversely, why do scientists attempt to assert scientific &quot;certainty&quot; on things that lie outside the realm of the measureable which is the heart of science.  These fields certainly have things to offer each other but they are different and require different techniques.<br />Shermer covers a lot of important ground in what is a relatively brief book.  As a summary of the state of the secular vs. religious conflict alone it is a valuable book.  He also does not equivocate about his own beliefs but still manages to give a fair hearing to both sides, pointing out where each side tends to step over the line into the ridiculous.  Of course, this is Shermer's quest and one he handles well.  It's people like him who make the rest of us shore up our arguments and stay intellectually honest.  Read this book and agree or disagree with Shermer but don't just close your mind to it because he (or anyone) thinks differently than you.	2001-01-28

I found this book browsing one day, liked the summary, and decided to give it a try.  Usually, I really enjoy books centered around academic life and its stuggles.  This one, however, didn't do much for me.<br />I think the main problem I have with this book is that the plot is way out of touch with any kind of reality.  Some might say that this is satire and that the reality of the plot is not what is important.  Others might say that I'm missing the allusions in the novel.  They may be right but that doesn't change the fact that this book is not right for me (and readers like me).  There is so much here that doesn't make logical sense and so much that is left unexplained that I couldn't settle in and enjoy the humor that Hynes develops.  And there are a lot of insightful and funny moments in this book.  But the significance of almost the entirety of Part III is lost on me.<br />I think I also had a problem with the fact that there is not a really likeable character in this book.  The ostensible protagonist, Nelson, shows himself to be very shallow from early on and so his quest becomes uninteresting to me.  None of the other characters are deep enough (or likeable enough) to be a hook for the novel.<br />Let it be said that Hynes clearly knows the academic milieu and many of his barbs are sharp; however, a more realistic and logical chain of events would have made this book more effective.  And I don't mean the main conceit of Nelson's ability with his severed finger.  That I can take.  But when you pile on the rest, it becomes unmanageable.	2001-01-28

His prose is very engaging and, even here, in a book I did not really care for, his writing has the ability to pull you along.  That made this book an easy read; however, this simply is not a high quality story--certainly no where near the excellence of The Alienist or even The Angel of Darkness.<br />Perhaps I read too much science fiction in my younger days but Carr seems a little out of his league here.  As I read this book I thought of something I'd read by a science fiction author/critic awhile back (I can't remember who--maybe Lester del Rey or Orson Scott Card?) who said that a science fiction writer was allowed one &quot;impossible&quot; thing when imagining the future--for example, faster than light travel--and everything else had to center around that.  Otherwise the reader wouldn't be able to suspend his disbelief.  The story would contain too much information to absorb.<br />That seems to be the trap into which Carr has fallen.  There are so many things that are possible that Carr has created--computer-altered assasinations, anti-gravity ships, genetically-altered superhumans, etc.--but all together in one story it is too difficult to take it all.  It seems a mismash of possible futures rather that one well-developed possible future.<br />And then he finishes with the unforgivable sin of a world changed by time-travel--and he doesn't even tell us what was changed and how it could have created this new world--and he tops it with making that new world a better one.  True, Carr gives us a lot of interesting things to think about but I guess I don't like my dystopian futures topped with a happy ending.	2001-01-25

In a sense, he's grown-up as I've grown-up and his current taste for more intellectual humor has matched my own.  His play, Picasso at the Lapin Agile, is one of the most enjoyable I've seen in awhile and is collected in book form with some shorter plays that are also quite good.  Additionally, his pieces in the New Yorker have been wonderful.<br />This novella does not quite reach the heights of some of his other work, though it is an enjoyable read.  It has its wry comic moments but this is a much more straightforward work than I've seen from him before.  It is really a character study; mainly of the clinically depressed &quot;shopgirl,&quot; Mirabelle but also of a number of other characters--boyfriends Ray &amp; Jeremy, co-worker Lisa, and her parents.<br />The plot is real and relevant enough, exploring the psyches and relationships of these characters.  It suffers from the weakness of many an ambitious novella, however.  It introduces intriguing points and doesn't take the time to flesh them out and resolve them.  Her father's Vietnam experience and its repercussions, for example, is tossed out and left unexplored.  More importantly, however, the story is rushed to its conclusion.  The early relationship points are explored and then rushed to their finality.  There is a lot more that could have been done with this book.<br />Perhaps I would have been happier with this piece if I'd read it in a magazine.  When I pay money for a book, however, I guess I want more of my money's worth.  I'm tired of short works being put in hardcover when they don't qualify.  This is a trend in modern fiction that is not to be encouraged.  Novels are getting shorter and more superficial.  It takes a brilliant writer to write a short novel of enough depth to deserve the hardback treatment.  I don't think this one is quite there.  Wait for it in paperback (and hope the paperback is relatively cheap).(and hope the paperback is relatively cheap).	2000-12-16

It fills in a gap in the writings about Anne.  There's been some nice work done on the study of the diary itself and a number of nice biographies for young readers; however, the number of serious biographies of Anne covering her entire life story can be counted on the fingers of one hand.<br />As a summary, this book works very nicely.  It is particularly good in covering the history of the Frank family upto the time of their going into hiding.  The analysis of the years in hiding is fair as well as the summary of the events following the arrest of the people of the &quot;secret annex.&quot;  I also liked the epliogue which gives a brief account of many of the people involved in Anne's life upto their deaths or the present day.<br />The weakness of this book is that is not much more than a summary of known material.  I did not feel I learned many new things by reading this book.  Additionaly, I feel some of this ground is better covered in other books.  For example, Willy Lindwer's book, The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank, is a much more detailed and more engaging book about the events after the arrest.  And anyone really interested in the details of Anne's life and the development of the diary can't do better than the Critical Edition of the diary.<br />Don't get me wrong: this is a good biography.  It is especially good for someone who doesn't know anything of Anne beyond the diary and wants to know more.  This is a good place to start.  Just keep in mind that their are other sources of material that are even better than this one.  And that the diary itself is still the best place to get to &quot;know&quot; Anne.	2000-12-11

It's centered around a church in the periphery of a Catholic diocese in the 1950's and peopled by a number of odd characters with a connection to the church--a gaggle of nuns, the parish priest whose the worse for drink and faith, a nosy rectory housekeeper, a progressive bishop with a secret.  And, of course, there's Fludd himself, who shows up at the rectory one night and becomes the pastor's assistant.  Who (and what) Fludd really is is the core of this novel's interest.<br />For the Catholics who read it, this book brings out a lot of things to think about but doesn't bang you over the head with them.  It's always a fun novel and never a philosphical lecture.  For the time it takes, it's certainly worth a read.	2000-12-11

Others are very good at putting you into history.  Both have their place.  But an author who can do the latter is special and Dava Sobel is one of the latter.<br />Her book, Longitude, was her first and is excellent, bringing to light a crucial and little known part of scientific history.  The story of Galileo is better known but often misunderstood by even science teachers like myself.  However, by framing the Galileo's story around his daughter's letters (Galileo's replies are lost) we get the feeling of being there in the early 17th century and a real taste of Galileo's successes and setbacks.<br />I suppose that many people might be put off by this style of history-telling.  It is often difficult for a 21st century person to understand the interests and cares of people 25 years ago let alone 400 years ago.  I think it's fascinating, however, to see the differences: a time when science was new, creating an awe that is lost on modern people, and religion permeated peoples lives, God's world being as present as the physical one.<br />As a Catholic, I was particularly interested in Galileo's struggles with the Church.  I have often felt this period to be in many ways a low point in Church history.  Interestingly, it turns out to be what these things often are: a struggle between both high- and low-minded Church officials, where political issues end up winning out over theological and philosophical ones.  Galileo's conviction by the Inquisition (on what appears to be a vote of 7-3) was caused by many factors and his continued support by many highly placed Catholics even after his conviction shows the lack of unanimity in opinion.  If I have one disappointment in the Church, it is that Galileo's book, Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems, was reviewed and given an imprimatur by Church officials who then backtracked and put the book on the Index and Galileo to trial.<br />In any case, despite these negatives in Galileo's life, it was nice to see the important role that his daughter, Suor Mary Celeste, played in his life.  I have stood before Galileo's tomb in Florence and yet I never realized that his daughter is buried there with him--certainly a sign of her importance to him.  And certainly a sign that Sobel has made a wise choice is how to tell Galileo's story.Galileo's life, it was nice to see the important role that his daughter, Suor Mary Celeste, played in his life.

Unfortunately, the two novels since the undeniably brilliant Einstein's Dreams have been stories of diminishing returns.<br />This is a wonderful concept for a novel.  Anyone who has ever felt very ill and not known the cause will sympathize with Bill Chalmers.  Lightman does a credible job of conveying Chalmers' fear, especially during the initial attack of amnesia.  After awhile, though, the story seems to go off track, offering a rather bland descent into job loss, lawsuit, and paralysis.<br />I was also disappointed by two things in particular.  The first I will frame as a question: Do real, educated people really misspell so obviously and often in their e-mails?  If I received e-mails from my business associates and, particularly, my doctor with the number of typos that Lightman provides, I would find myself new associates.<br />Secondly, I was disappointed in the presence of this &quot;dialogue of Plato&quot; in pieces recurring throughout the novel.  This trend of telling a parallel story intertwined in the body of the main novel is one that I have seen a lot lately (Richard Powers' and Margaret Atwood's most recent novels spring to mind) and, generally, it has not been used very effectively, in my opinion.  Certainly, the story of Anytus offers almost nothing to the story of Chalmers.  I don't understand its presence here.<br />Despite this, the novel is a quick read and not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon; however, there are many other novels I'd choose before this one.	2000-11-26

She was right.  This is a fun, touching and interesting book.<br />The main thing that I like about it is that it seems real.  I felt Jane's bewilderment in her relationships and, though her relationships are not mine, it felt like the bewilderment I often have.  I felt her companionship in the stuggle we all have to find that one person to be with.  I love the story of her relationship with her father.  Yes, the happy ending is standard fare but I am a sucker for happy endings and there is considerable tension in the last few pages as to whether she's blown it or not--tension we all feel when we've found that person we think is the one and make mistakes.<br />The twenty pages that comprise &quot;The Best Possible Light&quot; is the only section that seems really out of place.  It's an interesting tale but sticks out like a sore thumb since it's really unconnected to the rest of the narrative (despite the fact that Jane is Nina's upstairs neighbor).  I became confused when, for these few pages, Nina became the story's &quot;I.&quot;<br />This is a small complaint, however.  This is a good story with which to spend an afternoon.  That's all it should take to enjoy this gently unfolding tale.	2000-11-25

I still think it is a magnificent overview of basic mathematics.  In fact, it is one of the best overviews of basic mathematics that I have ever read.  Dunham covers a wide range of topics and he does so in a very readable and understandable manner without giving up reasonable mathematical rigor.  Someone with elementary algebra and geometry can follow all of Dunham's arguments and enjoy.<br />Of course, it is impossible to cover the entire range of mathematics in a book such as this but Dunham has chosen well.  He sticks mainly to the fundementals of the major fields.  In addition, his book reminds us that people with personalities have developed mathematics and that it's not a field created merely to strike fear into the hearts of schoolkids (and adults).<br />This book will always hold a special place for me:  it was the catalyst for an epiphany.  I had been teaching high school geometry for a few years when this book came out and I was very good at teaching the modern methods of proof and problem-solving.  On the other hand, I didn't really like teaching constructions, because, though I could do them quite well, I didn't truly understand their place and function in geometry and its development.  When I first read chapter &quot;G&quot; of this book (&quot;Greek Geometry&quot;), however, it was like a thousand puzzle pieces fell into place and I knew more than how to do constructions, I understood them and was able to teach them more effectively.<br />If you have any interest in mathematics at all, I recommend this book.  It will not disappoint.	2000-11-12

As a physics and mathematics teacher, I am very interested in this man who revolutionized 20th century thought.  However, only a portion of this already very slight book, is biographical material about Godel.  So, if you are looking for a real biography, look elsewhere.<br />Instead, this book briefly covers Godel's life, briefly covers his work, and briefly covers a few of the effects Godel has had on current thought.  In that sense, it is not bad.  A person who understands very little about modern mathematical thought but has an interest might find this book digestable and learn a bit.  Others are not going to enjoy this book.  People with strong backgrounds in mathematics are going to find it too weak and people with weak backgrounds in mathematics are going to find most of it indecipherable.	2000-11-11

I particularly like the breadth of his intelligence.  When I read his novels I get the sense that this guy knows a lot of stuff about a lot of things.<br />Ususally, however, his cleverness is reflected also in the plot and characters of his novels.  &quot;The Gold Bug Variations&quot; and &quot;Galatea 2.2&quot; were peopled by brilliant characters who gave voice to Power's intelligence.  &quot;Gain&quot; seems to be more of an explication of Powers' understanding of the history of commerce and its influence on modern life and health than anything else.<br />Not that I didn't enjoy &quot;Gain.&quot;  In fact, I found Powers' history lesson in the store the Clares quite engaging.  And the story of Laura's battle with cancer also had its moments though I didn't really care for her as much as I did the various Clares who claw their way to the top of the business world.  Powers may be trying to say something about the evils of the corporation in the modern world but her seems to me to be more attached to the corporation he develops than the character.<br />Also, I found the switches between the stories every few pages to be a bit jarring; particularly because they are only loosely connected.  Toxins produced by the Clare Corporation may (or may not) have caused Laura's cancer but this is not really enough to draw the stories together.  Not a single character intersects the two stories, even at the end to draw the stories together.  Each story has its own merits but they are really different stories.  Worth reading, but probably easier to read separately.	2000-10-23

This book, on the other hand, I thought was considerably better.  The characters were much more engaging and the plot, for the most part, was more interesting.<br />The book does go a little off track at the end of part IV.  The death of Joe's brother was too predictable to be streched out as long as it was as was Sammy's dealings (to a lesser degree) with Tracy Bacon.

After covering  &quot;How the Irish Saved Civilization&quot; and &quot;The Gift of the  Jews&quot; Mr. Cahill has moved on to basic Christianity in a book  subtitiled &quot;The World Before and After Jesus.&quot;  This book is a  solid introduction to the history of the time and I found in it a gathering  of a lot of current information that I have read elsewhere in more  technical journals and books.  For that, I think it needs to be  applauded.<br />Mr. Cahill is writing this book to a tough crowd.  Because of  the dominace of Christianity in its various forms in Western Civilization,  everyone has an opinion on it no matter how much background a person has  and these people are hard to please.  Because his first book covered a much  lesser known period and place and his second covered a much less widely  known religion (despite the fact that Christianity is descended from it),  they are more easily received.  This one deserves real consideration too,  no less because it is a book for the popular crowd and not for experts.	2000-09-04

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  Proust really seems to be about the beauty of language and description.  The sentences and paragraphs are long but they flow beautifully and I  appreciate an author who wants to say beautiful things as well as tell a  story.  Literature isn't all about plot.

Reminiscent of Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;, it, too, describes an  anti-utopian future of considerable power.  But, whereas in  &quot;1984&quot; we know the strangeness of the world we are reading about  from the first paragraph, Lowry builds the strangeness of the world of  &quot;The Giver&quot; slowly, with revelations that take the story to a  fever-pitch.  It is a wonderful book.<br />&quot;Gathering Blue&quot; has a  similar flavor to &quot;The Giver&quot; but not the power.  Whereas  &quot;The Giver&quot; reminded me of &quot;1984&quot;, &quot;Gathering  Blue&quot; reminded me of &quot;Planet of the Apes.&quot;  Now, I'm a fan  of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, mind you, but it's not the same  thing.<br />Again, in &quot;Gathering Blue&quot;, there is the story of an  anti-utopian future society.  Kira is a girl who has lost both of her  parents.  The book opens with her mourning her mother.  Because of her  deformed leg, Kira is now at risk of being killed herself as she can no  longer contribute to her society made primitive after an event called the  Ruin.  Her unequalled skill with a needle and thread, however, keep her  alive and get her close enough to the power of her society to see its  secret horrors.<br />&quot;Gathering Blue&quot; is a good story.  Certainly  better than much of what's out there.  What I like about this story even  over &quot;The Giver&quot; is that it seems almost more real.  While  reading, I felt that this kind of primitive society could really develop.  What it lacks is the tension and surprises of &quot;The Giver.&quot;  There  is little tension in Kira's trial because we know she has to live for the  story to go on.  There are a couple of surprises in the last few pages but  they are not a powerful as in &quot;The Giver.&quot;<br />It is a risk to read  a book by an author who has written one of your favorite books because it  is difficult to beat the comparison.

As a math lover and teacher myself, I really wanted to connect with Mona but I had a tough time.  All the characters are quirky enough but sometimes I really had no  clue as to what is going on.  Fortunately, the book is short enough that I  felt I could keep going and Bender pulls it all together in a very  satisfying conclusion.  It is certainly worth the time spent on it.	2000-07-26

His comedy takes at least a certain amount of intelligence and education to understand.  I appreciate having to think and  be somewhat aware of my culture and environment to get many of the  jokes.<br />I think Miller's ranting style is funny, too.  I can hear his  voice as I read the rants in his various books.  I even occasionally laugh  out loud reading him which is very rare for me.<br />This particular volume of  rants (his third) is classic Miller.  If you like his style then you'll  like this book.  Its one weakness was the Clinton/Lewinsky joke came up way  too many times.  His ability to come up with a unique skew on things is too  good to fall back on this chestnut as many times as he does.<br />This is a  small complait, though, about what is generally a very funny book.	2000-07-25

No book in history has had this kind of pre-publication mania.  It would take a great book to survive that kind of publicity.  Fortunately for  children and adults everywhere, Rowling pulls it off.<br />My biggest concern  about the book is its length.  When I heard about the size this book was  going to be, I thought Ms. Rowling might have bitten off a bit more than  she could chew.  I, for one, enjoy long novels.  In fact, one of my pet  peeves about the modern novel is that these 180 page knock-offs are being  touted as novels.  However, a long novel that is very readable, especially  when your target audience is kids, is a major task--a task Ms. Rowling  accomplishes admirably.  The conceit of the Triwizard Tournament really  keeps the book going and opens up a lot of possibilities for interaction  with the other magic schools which I think can really add something to the  future books.<br />If I have any concern about the book is that it really  leaves me wondering about the future books.  I enjoyed the &quot;school  atmosphere&quot; of the first four books which I don't think can be  sustained since a pitched battle with Voldemort must be coming.  Real life  is going to draw the focus away from Hogwarts.  I hope this doesn't happen  to a great extent.<br />Still, this book shows that book 5 will be another  bestseller, and deservedly so.  I know that Ms. Rowling writes for children  and I'm not one but I've always said that a truly good &quot;children's  books&quot; will also appeal to adults.  This series certainly does and I'd  like to compliment Ms. Rowling for a job well done.  I look forward to  future volumes with the excitement of a child.	2000-07-24
