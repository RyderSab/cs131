The characters were neither believable nor particularly likeable.  Very contrived story.  Her best asset in the early books was to make the characters so empathetic, likeable, believable and fallible too. Her story lines were so wonderful - they made you think how natural the lives of the characters were. I  couldn't wait for the next Binchy book to come out.  Sorry, this one just did not do it for me at all.	2005-05-10

This was my feeling throughout the book.  The characters were likable and their stories were interesting but the dialog was rubbish. Real people (even very religious ones) do not talk like this.  I forced myself to finish the book but I really feel that Sarah was not only a plaster saint but just \\"too good to be true.\\" <br />Summary:  Inspiring tales - horrible writing.	2005-04-14
US	47582992	R3N02DN79YU6SL	0552547344	454973847	Unarranged Marriage	Books	4	2	2	N	N	good laughs and terrrific style	The story of this book is how the protagonist plans to get out of an arranged marriage to a girl he has never seen at the tender age of 17.  The author handles the situation of a British-born young man living in a traditional and closed Punjabi environment in a special way.  The parents are lower-middle class and completely uninterested in educating their children, only getting them all married at the age of 17 to girls or boys from India whom they have never met and thereafter making a living for the whole family who all live together- at least the boys and their wives do. <br /> <br />The other side of the coin is that Manjit (or Manny a he prefers to be called)  goes to a government school and his best friend is black while his girlfriend and his best friend's girlfriend are both white.  Why this is important is that the family, especially the father, consider that mixing with anyone other than Asians is a no-no.  However, the boy is in a terrible dillema as he loves his life outside the home.  In the home he is beaten by his father until no love could possibly remain between them, if there ever was any.  He also hates his second brother with whom he has to share a room until the brother's marriage.  This brother is loud, ignorant, smelly with body-odour and a terrible bully.  In fact the author says that he (the brother) is reaching his maturity \\"like a large ape, complete with fur and fleas.\\"  <br /> <br />It is a long time since I laughed out loud at a book and I managed to do this on page 24 for a start.  His style of writing is hilarious and the subject matter is so interesting. Although  I have read many other Indian books, this is the first time I have come across the  Punjabi Sikh customs. <br /> <br />I found the names peculiar - there is Manjit and his older brother Ranjit and two of his sisters have identical names expect for the first letter.  <br /> <br />  I am definitely going to read some of his other books.  I felt real empathy for Manjit  and hemakes most of the characters so real.  Have deducted a star because the book was a little repetitive in parts.	2005-03-03

Several of the people involved, especially Cill, Howard and Louise, had the most horrendous childhoods which contained bullying, beating and parental abuse.  This part is not pleasant reading.  What I did enjoy however, is the way that Walters developed the characters and especially the interplay between George and Jonathan.

We don't have to work out who did it but why and how.  She is a creepy, illiterate woman who is deeply ashamed of her illiteracy and quite smart in finding ways to hide it.  She also manages to find people willing to help her write letters and read lists for her.  With a brain that could do this, she very possibly could have learnt to read and write if she had put her mind to it.<br />Ruth Rendell simply cannot write a bad book but this was her most enjoyable for me.  The characters are so well rounded and so believable, the suspense is high and the writing style is simply great. The pages just seem to turn themselves and the book is impossible to put down.<br />Eunice eventually befriends Joan Smith, an equally creepy, evil person who is fact turns out to be a psychopath. The Coverdale family is also extremely believable.  Eunice does not know what to make of the fact that she cannot blackmail the daughter as she is not used to people like this.<br />If there is anyone out there who has never read a Ruth Rendell, start with this one.  I envy you as each and every one of her books, in my opinion, is excellent.	2004-05-12

Ted comes across as just a numbers cruncher - surely an intelligent woman like Margaret cannot be satisfied living with this boring lump.  As for Michael, he is so one-dimensional as to be totally unbelievable and he has no backbone whatsoever. Schwarz's male characters seem to exist as cardboard cutouts in the background somewhere and their only purpose is to render one-liners to their spouses here and there to make the story more believable.<BR> I found it even more unlikely that the very bright Letty could live with and admire someone of this calibre.<BR>  <BR>I did enjoy the use of e-mails and could really &quot;see&quot; Letty through her writing of them.  She seems like the kind of person I would admire and want to be friendly with.<BR>Schwarz is very moralistic and the story had a weird and strangely unsatisfying ending.

This is one great book.  Have been painting for about 4 years and have given away paintings to friends and family members rather than selling them. I did not buy this book for advice on selling but rather because the cover caught my eye.  His style is semi-abstract and very graffic. His colours are bright, bright, bright and this suits me just fine. Have been using his paintings as start-off points and then veering off into my own interpretation of them.  Mike Svob tells it like it is. There is no pussyfooting around here.  I love his straitforward way of thinking and the fact that he does not pull his punches.  At the moment it has become a bit of a bible for me and am really loving working with this book. Can highly recommend it to artists of bright, graffic work.	2004-03-10

Jenny is completely besotted with Martha and slowly she becomes her reason for living.  The author takes us into the twisted workings of Jenny's mind and makes her peculiar and devious behaviour understandable to us.  Each chapter is written alternatively by the two protagonists and the writing is clever and very addictive.<br />Both characters are completely rounded and three-dimensional and we come to know these two ladies very well.  The other neighbours are more shallowly dealt with and the portrayal of Jenny's husband, Graham, makes him almost too good to be true.  I don't think many men would put up with this kind of behaviour and still remain loving and supportive.<br />   Unfortunately it had a very unlikely ending which I felt was a let-down.  In view of this I gave the book only 4 stars.	2004-01-13

However, a book about 4 young boys growing up together and which tells you in the foreward that 2 of them will be dead by the end of the story, is overpowering stuff to say the least.<BR>I found it absolutely fascinating reading although very cruel in parts.  His portrayal of the&quot;best father&quot; who is in reality a wife-beating, son-beating bully and coward, is very good indeed.  The boys hold him in awe for his war skills and do not see the horrible man inside.  Litt manages to round out his characters and, in particular, we see the growth of the four different main characters coming to life.  I am looking forward to reading more of Litt's books.	2003-11-12

Before reading &quot;The Little Friend&quot; I had seen some of the critical reviews but did not agree with them during the first half of the book.  Then about midway, the writing style almost seems to have changed.  The book became over-wordy, over-moody and just plain boring in parts.  A great shame as I think Donna Tartt is a very, very talented writer.  Most of the other reviews restated the plot so I will not do that here.  Suffice it to say that a.)  I hope it does not take Ms. Tartt so many years to write her next book and, b.) Hope she finds a totally different subject.	2003-11-05

Winston Graham's style is sharp and interesting.

This book was trilling from beginning to end.  Peter Abrahams has an ability to create exciting plots and very real people who take part in them.  Could not put this book down. The plot deals with the kidnapping of babies and also with detailed descriptions of scuba diving.  A very unusual combination but it works terrifically.  Few men writers are so able to get into a woman's mind.  It's really time that this book and some of his earlier works are brought back into print.	2003-09-29

I just love Abrahams' writing style.  It is surpassed only by the diverse subjects he writes about.  This man is an authority on many aspects of life, both high and low and he is particularly knowegable on most sports. As I am not really a sports fan, it is a mark in his favour that he is able to hold my interest here. This book also deals with campus life, about which he knows a lot and writes extremely well.  His style also reminds me a lot of the late Jerome Weidman who was my (then) favourite writer.  Go Peter, go, more of the same please.	2003-09-29

Strangely this book did not grab me like other Peter Abrahams' books have done, and I can't quite put my finger on why.  Having just read another review, I see that the reader did not understand the plot at all, even to the point of naming certain characters to be people whom they were not.  Anyway, I finished the book with a certain disappointment - it just did not live up to my expectations. I still intend to read all his other books that I can get my hands on as the ones that I have read have been really gripping.	2003-09-17

This book is whiny and has no plot at all.  However, it does give a lot of insight into the British prison system.  In fact, Archer, being a lord, is not really treated badly at all in comparison to the other prisoners.

He can hardly write a bad book but this exploration of young people's problems and angst was certainly one of his best if not the very best.  Goldman's style is just out of this world.

His style is brilliant, just brilliant.  As for holding the reader's interest, well, not for one moment can you put this book down.  I kept saying I'll go to sleep now but 4 or 5 chapters later, I was still holding my breath and turning the pages with awe.  Way to go, Mr. Goldman.  Couldn't we have more, please.

I love Abrahams' style.  Not for one moment is the reader's interest allowed to wane.  His character descriptions are brilliant which shows his great grasp of the human race, the so-called &quot;normal&quot; people and life's oddballs.  True, Mackie does sound a little bit too good to be true but I suppose there are people like that.  My imagination was also a bit stretched by the fact that Lianne, a wholesome, well-brought up teenager, would suddenly not only think of a crime but would be prepared to participate in it.  Other than these two instances, I found the rest very believable indeed.  Anyway, buy this book, borrow it from a friend or go to your local library.  A treat awaits you.  Also, I think it is time that Abrahams' older books were brought back into print.  I am sure there are enough other readers like myself who don't only read &quot;new&quot; books.  Yes, looking at the date of first publication is interesting, but certainly not an indication of whether the book should be read or not.	2003-08-18

It's  amazing how she gets inside the heads of her characters.  Does she really know people like this or is she simply intuitive to the nth degree?  Sandor is obsessed with Nina, Joe is obsessed with Sandor and neither has their love returned.  Unlike a previous reviewer, I found the ending very satisfying as really, how else could it end?   The character of Sandor's mother, Diana, and the character of Paul, the bodyguard, are made extremely believable.  In the case of Diana, who is a very minor character, it is truly amazing what the author is able to achieve with such a small part given over to her. The only slightly unbelievable part was that Apsoland, such a very thorough, security expert, gets fooled by 2 of the characters whom I won't name as it would give the game away if someone has not yet read the book.  I think that Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine is truly the best mystery writer alive today.  She surpasses all the competition.	2003-03-05

The story is highly enjoyable, fast, tense, humourous and satisfying, and the writing is impeccable. Philip Randall, an able, intelligent and charming young lawyer, has a dark side to him and some real selfishness in his character. The author's big achievement is, even though all his bad qualities are clear from the beginning, the reader cannot help liking him and identyfing with him.  The story really grabbed me and the characters were very &quot;real&quot;.  I was cross with myself for not figuring out the ending as there were enough clues left lying around.  Altogether a highly satisfying read and I look forward to Mr. Roughan's next book.	2003-02-10

Arnie Goldman has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis since the age of 8 and his friend, Redso, turns out to be a manic depressive.

The pages just flow one into the next. Will definitely try and get his other book.  It seems he has only written one other.  I identified with all three main characters even though Redso is not a likeable person at all.<BR>Did not really want to give the book 5 stars because the ending was a bit weak but decided that the quality of the writing and the way the story gripped me, was worth the extra star.

The book was so \\"busy\\"with all the runnings around of the crowd during the fire that it generated an uneasy feeling in me. The action snapped back and forth at an alarming rate.  Not at all a pleasure to read.  Hope she goes back to her previous style in her next book.  She used to be able to create very good psychological thrillers.	2002-09-03

Sherry Camhy writes simply but in an interesting way and especially does not assume that all her readers are beginners. She is very knowledgeable in her field and it is obvious she has done a lot of research.  I have found this book very useful and the drawings, paintings and other illustrations are superb.  Would recommend it for any artist who has been drawing and/or painting for 2,3 or 4 years.	2001-09-05

It is surpassed only by his imagination for topics to write about. The chapter on learning French had me on the floor laughing. Nearly 30 years, ago when we emigrated to Israel, we attended daily classes in Hebrew and his stringing together of sentences reminded me so much of myself at that time. Highly recommended for anyone who likes quirky humour and a great writing style.	2001-08-29

Unfortunately I was disappointed by the time I reached the fourth chapter.  All the background information seemed to be written in parentheses instead of unfolding as part of the story.  Had to force myself to finish it and do not think that the last line justified all the (unnecessary)and (repetitious) detail.	2000-11-06
