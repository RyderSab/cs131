He captures the character, the inner self, the most basic essence of a subject and capture it on black and white film. It's as if he breaths  on his photographs and they come to life. He does it for Hillary Clinton,  he does it for giraffes--all mesmerizing to look at. I wish he could  photograph everyone in the world--it would be a so much more interesting  place if all the static, cliche portraits were replaced with his vivid  work. The book includes color and magazine shoots, too--which prove the  range of his talent. Who else could capture a different facet of the  exhaustively photographed Linda Evangelista in every shot? Or make the  form, the line of a model reclining on a whitewashed wall as interesting as  the model's beauty? A really great book of pictures whose character, form,  lines will entrance any viewer.This book -- or should I say Demarchelier's  work--deserves more than five stars. How about ten?	1999-09-23

Even before Pennington suspected her husband of a secret life there  was plenty suspect about Stammberger. The guy liked to go off and climb big  mountains solo, san oxygen, and when he couldn't get a climbing permit he'd  enter sensitive, dangerous areas of the world illegally, hiking in through  rough, unpatrolled country to bag peaks. This alone would (statistics  prove) have guaranteed him a life span shorter than the one he actually  lived as a captured spy. Pennington's story is poorly written (she's s  spokesmodel, what do you expect?) and she doesn't get it that whatever her  husband was up to, whether he was a spy or not it was illegal and he WAS  NOT a US citizen--being married to one does not count when it comes to  risky rescue and investigations. She barely consults her husband's country  for help, preferring to spend years (during which Stammberger was  apparently still alive) chasing after US intelligence officers  who--obviously--couldn't and weren't required to hand over any information  about a German national's activities in dicey area of the world. What is  surprising is that Pennington gets any resolution at all--really. She  reminds me of Gennifer Flowers--tenacious, if a little dim. A weird story  that would be much more palatable if Pennington had gotten a ghost author  to help her with her 8th grade prose.	1999-09-23

You'll get on Oprah and have a bestseller on your hands for  sure. But what do we really get with &quot;The Courage to Be Rich&quot;?  Financial basics for the rank beginner--what's IRA, what does an interest  rate mean, what are points, credit card debt is bad--unless you used it for  medical care to save someone's life--then it's honorable, or  &quot;good&quot;. There's some very contradictory messages thrown in--Orman  encourages you to think rich thoughts, while at the same time telling you  to embark on penurious habits, like buying half gallons of cheap, chemical  laden ice cream instead of feeding yourself less good quality, all natural  premium pints...She tells you to try the generic of every single thing you  buy, but also says she felt she fit in her first &quot;real job&quot; only  because her mother gave her a &quot;proper&quot; (i.e., expensive) watch an  a diamond necklace to it so she'd fit in. Orman's only nod to the fact that  the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer in this country  and that tax breaks favor overwhelmingly, the already-haves is to mention  occasionally that there are fewer and fewer tax write-offs than there used  to be. But otherwise, if you're not rich it's not the economy, it's  your mind set, and your shameful credit card habits. The same woman who  tells you that you ARE the car you drive would have you diving into couch  cushions for change...are these rich thoughts or merely addled thinking?  You decide.	1999-09-20

The binding shows this book is a workhorse. It's vinyl coated  hardbound, with a covered spiral binding. In other words, it opens flat and  won't fall apart with use.The format: a generous lower margin allows you to  prop it open (flat!) in a stand to refer to as you work. Each type fabric  is presented in alphabetical order and on two facing pages--it's all there  when you're working, you don't have to skip around. An photograph of the  garment made of the fabric is included--so you can see the subtle  difference between silk dupioni and shantung...and an appropriate garment  for the fabric. Under bold, clear headings are listed the recommended  needle, closure, layout, marking, cutting, interfacing, thread, presser  foot, closures, stitch length, preshrink, pressing, hem for the fabric.  There are also fascinating tips to improve your sewing and interesting  facts about the fabric. I'll never use the same old needle and thread  again, and now know what would make some of my garments look couture  perfect rather than homemade. This truly is an essential guide for EVERY  sewer.	1999-09-03

He writes beautifully--this is the work of a top drawer journalist--and yet unobtrusively. It reminds me of Krakauer's Into  Thin Air. And like Krakauer, Ryback comes from magazine writing. A few  years ago when magazines had more room for copy and less space was used on  ads this might have appeared unabridged The New York Times Sunday Magazine  or The Atlantic Monthly--as cover stories, of course. But now, with small  hardback book bindery and clever formatting it suffices as a full-blown  book. I read it in 2 hours. Still, it is compelling. As for Martin  Zaidenstadt, I never saw him at Dachau any time I visited there (1981  onwards). He appears to indeed be a survivor of WWII and maybe of  Dachau--but he also surely is a panhandler preying on the sympathies and  guilt of Dachau visitors and (in my humble opinion!) the man is suffering  from senile dementia.	1999-08-28

No mention is made of Dodi's fiance, who was stashed on a nearby  yacht during the first two weeks of D&amp;D's six week &quot;love&quot;  affair.

I've read these graceful four line poems over and over, and every time gain fresh insight. The genius of this work is that it can be  read on so many different levels--give it to a couple newly in love and  they can read it to each other as a book of love poems. Give it to a  serious seeker of God and they will understand the love and beloved of the  poems to be the relationship between Rumi and God, and the ecstasy of real  communion with God...either way, this poems are beautiful and infinite. I  brought this book to Afghanistan (where Rumi was born) and found the love  of this poet (who they know as Bahlki) to be a bond, and we translated many  poems back and forth...there are many more. BUY this book! And buy five  copies to give to friends. Even people who think they don't like or read  poetry end up loving this book, especially if they are on the path to God.	1999-08-10

With her cultured and educated eye for style, Jackie accomplished from the start what took Princess Diana ten years to figure out: How to create a distinct look and always stand out in a crowd. Jackie had the height, the  figure, and a love of the finest quality and simplicity in all things. She  hired Oleg Cassini, who agreed to &quot;dress&quot; her only if he were her  one and only designer. Cassini had a perfect vision for the demands of  Jackie's position, and an eye for the look she could pull off. Being her  only designer meant gave Jackie a look, a continuity of style that only she  could carry off. The demands on Cassini were great--he had to produce her  entire wardrobe, and she wanted to be wearing originals. Occasionally she'd  ask for someting from his ready-to-wear line, like when she went to India  and realized the heat might force her to change her clothes three or four  times a day, but otherwise Cassini did true couture for her--he designed  and made (with the help of his atelier, of course) every single garment  Jackie wore just for her and her figure and her schedule. The result was  magic! As the beautiful photographs show, Jackie always stood out in a  crowd. Wearing sleek, simple clothes in sumptuous fabrics, everyone else  inevitably looked fussy and overdressed in comparison--even when they were  trying to copy her style. This book is as maginificent tribute to Jackie,  couture, Cassini, and personal style. I loved reading the details about the  dresses which I heretofore had only caught glimpses of in photographs.  Princess Diana could have taken a page or two out of Jackie's book; indeed,  toward the end of her life she did. Many of Diana's best clothes could have  come straight from Cassini. Catherine Walker and Lagerfield for Chanel did  a great job of reinterpreting Cassini/Jackie style for Diana. For anyone  interested in fashion and history and the magic of the Kennedys, this books  is amazing.	1999-08-07

Tish Baldrige's book lays out the effort  to update The White House for two young, modern parents who inhabited it.  She also makes a case for the art of entertaining--a dying or even lost  art--and makes me want to throw a dinner party. The Kennedy's lived like  royality, it's true. I don't know if The White House would ever get away  with the extravagance and glamour today (now that we spend all our money on  defense and security), but the more innocent time of the Kennedy  administration was ripe for the kind of magic a handsome rancouteur and his  well-bred wife could generate. Every page of this book is fascinating, and  it's the most delicious slice of history I've ever read. And with the  recipes, you too can throw the same luncheon the Kennedys served Prince  Ranier and Princess Grace!	1999-08-02

This book is breezy and gossipy and so sycophantic I have to wonder how much of it it true.  Kiki justifies and sugar-coats as much as she can (is she still getting  Onassis money???? One has to wonder...), yet you can't help but see that  the Onassis clan were an abusive, debauched, and addictive bunch. She  rationalize EVERYTHING--physical and emotional abuse, drunkeness,  profligate spending, ruthlessness, cheating...but after all, Aristio was  really a very CHARISMATIC and RICH man who'd made it up from poverty. Other  sources dispute many of Kiki's facts. If she gets even the most basic  details wrong, what else is suspect (i.e., Jackie's governess/cook Marta  Sgubin is ITALIAN, not Spanish, and her name is Marta, not Martha)?  Everything. Does that make Onassis behavior any less reprehensible? It  shouldn't. I have to say that this book makes me think the Onassis family  did themselves in, no matter how much Kiki spins it.	1999-08-02

Double adjectives, often redundant, litter her narrative. When she's  not over-explaining, she's vague and uses constructions so convoluted I had  to read them several times to understand them. But she seems to warm up to  the task as she moves through her studies, and I found myself warming up to  her. Still, she's so PC, she leaves out a lot--ask anyone who's been to  Harvard about the dramatic egotists who call themselves healers there.  Also, having worked in hospitals for years, I'd have to say that if she  thought watching ER was giving her a taste for the real thing, she's wrong.  I can list at least 20 descrepancies between what ER, the tv show and ERs  in real life. That doctors and EDs behave as in real life as they do on ER  is WISHFUL thinking. Looking forward to Ellen growing up a little, and also  hearing about the proving ground of her residency.	1999-08-02

I've never  seen anything quite like it. I also compliment the author on her writing  abililty--it becomes apparent in the &quot;educating&quot; parts of her  books. She's facile at explaining chemistry in an understandable, easy to  visualize way and NOT be patronizing. That in itself is a feat.

Eight marriages, yet there's more information  about her pets than her husbands...but then her relationships with her pets  appear to be more profound than with those of humans. Ms. O'Neill comes  across as distracted and distant and often unaware--filming  &quot;Caravan&quot; in Iran, she blithely states that the entire country  was, at the time, addicted to drugs and also that they HATE dogs. Little  asides like this were hard to take--an entire country taking in their aging  relatives simply to have access to their prescriptions for morphine-based  drugs? A country of people that, to a person, HATE dogs. More like a  country in which families--extended families--live together as a custom,  and a religion (Islam) that regards dogs as dirty (a muslim must wash his  hands seven times after touching a dog). Perhaps I'm putting to fine a  point on my critique of just a couple of paragraphs, but this kind of  misinformation along with O'Neill's other vagaries make me question her  editor and her ability for introspection and, truthfully, her intellect.  She is very beautiful, and that includes an internal beauty that she  exudes...but I don't find her moral convictions totally believable, and I  wonder why she leaves out so much about what makes her interesting in the  first place--her looks and her modeling and her acting and her many  marriages. There is no index to this book, and the only photographs of a  woman who was THE spokeswoman for Cover Girl make up for something like  thirty years appear on the back of the hardbound edition.	1999-06-30

It's clear illustrations are a strong point. I wish I had a chance to be in on editing the next edition of it. I would  elaborate on the indexing--instead of &quot;hats&quot; followed by a bunch  of page numbers that leave the reader to look up search the book for what  they need to learn about hats, I'd add many subcategories--hats:shaping;  blocking...etc. It's a REFERENCE afterall. I would also make the book a  little more impersonal--more information, less Montse Stanley. Nothing  personal against her, I just think she might write a book of her own  techniques, projects, opinions apart from this reference, and then there'd  be more room for a comprehensive index. Still, I chose this over other  references for clear directions and technique illustrations.	1999-05-06

Like when I finally saw Big Ben only to find it covered in scaffolding. Watching the brouhaha it inspired in my book club, reading the reviews, I expected much,  much more from Garland. Is this the best he can do? Then I tried to cut him  some slack--hey, he's only 26. But then, at 26 (24--whatever) if anything I  had even more imaginative visions of what paradise on earth would look  like. Work details? Give me a break. No natives allowed? Sounded more like  a foreign military base than paradise. And that it was supposed to be so  secret, yet they found it so easily (having to swim to it was an  interesting twist, granted. Nevertheless, they made it there in a trice).  And just as quickly it all falls apart. Much like the book. And that  annoying Daffy--something to fall back on. Come on! This is NOT a great  book. Mediocre at best. 2 stars--as generous as I can be. He's young. I  wanted to like it. I really did.	1999-05-04

I would have bought this book on the strength of the customer reviews so far alone, but thought I'd look at it first. I'm glad I did. Unlike the rapturous reader who says s/he'd knit any sweater in the book, I didn't  find anything I'd knit. First off, Melville favors techniques that don't  look knitted. She likes slip stitch color knitting, woven stitch (a/k/a  linen stitch), and a technique for knitting a piece and then using that  knitting as a warp for weaving in colors of yarn with a darning needles.  The many assurances of how FAST this really is to do make me suspicious--I  prefer to knit, not weave with a darning needle. An interesting technique,  but it nor any of the others (also a lot of garter stitch) are looks I'm  after. I would really appreciate a book on using odd balls--but also work  on accepting the fact that the pattern/yarn/dye lot event is a rare thing  indeed, and all those extra balls of yarn come in handy for color work,  darning, strips in small projects...but it will never all be used up!	1999-04-04

I loved the format, the range (from the first shoes, to mules, to doc martins...) and in all the places I've searched,  this is one of the few books, frivolous as it may first appear, that has  photos of authentic &quot;lotus&quot; slippers worn by chinese women with  bound feet. I wish I'd saved every pair of shoes I've ever owned after  reading this, and that my family members had, too--history! That shoes are  ART is evident here--yet they must bear the weight and gait of the  wearer--unless it's Cleopatra, I learned. Or a rich daughter whose shoes  are expected to wear out on their first, and last outing, to a dance. I  hope there's a sequel--more pictures, more history, more shoes, shoes,  shoes. I read every word and looked at every photo at least once, and would  like to see more, particularly the historical shoes.	1998-12-09

Naipaul in book, exposing it to the eyes of any old reader. But where others saw as a viscious indictment  of Naipaul, I saw as insightful and honest and interesting account of the  lives of writers, the mentor/student relationship, and the paradox of the  genius as a human being. Theroux, as usual, flays himself as well as his  subject; You certainly cannot accuse him of blindsiding Naipaul with this  profile.I think no less or more of Naipaul or Theroux after reading Sir  Vidia's Shadow. I belive I KNOW more about both of them, and this adds to  my insight while readint their works. I certainly learned a lot about  writing,and the writing life, and I was interested in how different and  similar Naipaul and Theroux are. Naipaul suffers a book, Theroux channels  words like water. Yet they are both similar in many ways. I can see how a  fan--in the truest sense of the word, fanatic, won't like this book about  Naipaul. Breath everytime you feel a hissy fit coming on, and you'll get  through it and know a lot more about Naipaul for it.	1998-11-01

It's  not cute, it's not quirky, it's not charmingly eccentric or any of the  other adjectives common TV portrayals of this illness would lead you to  believe. It is a living hell that confines Colas to her house and severes  her links from society with extreme fear and a mind bent on extrapolating  threat from every detail of life. Spots on the sidewalk? Must be disease  carrying blood. But through shoes? Well, they soles of them are worn thin  in some places...Dinner date with an attractive guy presents a dilemma:  switch your poisoned plate fo his while he's in the kitch fetching salt?  But then you might get fingered for his murder. Eat it yourself and die?  And Colas ends up marrying this guy, who ends up being part of a household  where rituals include buying six toothbrushes for colas and then helping  her inspect the outer and inner wrapping for air-tightness. Tasting her  food at restaurants to be sure there are no ground up hypodermic needles in  there...naturally, in spite of &quot;in sickness and in health&quot; it  gets to be too much. So Colas hides her fears from her husband for awhile,  successfully, until she gives it away one day when she nears the TV to  change the volume just as the character starts to vomit blood, and Colas  can't contain her terror that the TV screen character may have exposed her  to some disease...Cola's writes with candor and lack of self pity. She  dispassionately flays the mind of an OCD, and she does so in a spare,  no-frills style that includes everything you need to know and no more. It's  riveting and horrifying at the same time, and Colas has done a great  service towards the understanding of mental illness.	1998-09-17

There's a whole slew of books out that strive to inspire via &quot;happy ending&quot; stories. The prayer is answered, a mysterious stranger appears to set things right in the nick of time. But as Reynolds Price, one of the authors of in this collection writes, &quot;The answer to most prayers is: No.&quot; In &quot;Survival Stories&quot; Editor Kathryn Rhett presents unanesthized stories of the people whose lives took that hairpin turn, got the fatal diagnosis, bore the child that would never get better, lost the face to snarling huskie or the jaw to cancer, failed at marriage not once but twice...all the things you hope, pray or smugly believe righteous living will stave off, but happen any way. This book is sobering, clear-eyed, and, in spite of being filled with people whose bodies, minds, souls have been flayed, inspiring, for these authors have all gone on living. They write of the will to survive that is what you are left with once every layer has been painstakin! gly peeled away.	1998-07-25

Unfortunately, the rest of the book uses long hand--long, long, long hand--to spell out the drama between young, hip, politically correct mixed-race Jane against the ruthless, evil, mindless system. jane reports herself in excruciatingly detail (I found myself skimming or skipping these parts altogether), and the rest of her characters are mindlessly dogmatic, drones for the beef-ex corporate machine. They're wife abusing, porn-loving. They have halitosis and are overweight. Among the few million americans, Jane can't seem to find an housewife and family that are acceptable to both her sensitive mores AND those of her cloddish employers. Instead she finds Louisiana creoles who eat chittlins (not beef!) and are poor and have good family values. She finds lesbian, biracial couple who are vegetarian. She finds a! !  family who, along with the entire population of their laid-off Indiana town, miracle-cured their comatose daughter. The daughter is now an &quot;angel&quot; and town's quarry business has been replaced by a rehab center. The daughter's coming out party features...lamb. Not evil beef! I get it, ruth, I get it! Without rubbing my face in it, I get. Maybe John Sayles will do a better job with the movie version.	1998-07-16

For any serious preserver, the book is worth the price for the creative, unusual way Hassol combines fruits and spice. As for the &quot;hymnal&quot; part, well, that appears to be a way of fleshing this out into something more than just a recipe pamphlet, and some very compassionate publisher's largesse to let Ms. Hassol work out her widowhood. There are enough banal meanderings and minor errors in the text (not the recipes!) to make you wonder if the editor ever looked at the manuscript after giving it the go ahead. But like I said, the recipes speak for themselves. In addition to jams, there are chutneys, marmalades and spreads. Ms. Hassol makes a case for some of the more unusual combinations using her experience selling her wares at a farmers' market. She gives jam-making includes jam-making and canning basics, resources, and a few good tips. All of the recipes use pectin, and unfortunately, there is no non-pectin alternative directions included. Arranging the book by season is a clever strategy than any &quot;real&quot; canner will appreciate.	1998-07-11

I am very sorry for Christopher Reeve, and by the end of the book I remain as unconvinced as he does of his quality of life post-accident. It is interesting to learn how his life is managed now that he is almost totally debilitated, and I appreciate that peek into his private life. Still, most of the book is rehashing the rather charmed life he led up until his accident--the main topic of this book is his acting career, in magnified detail. And yet in spite of this obsessive detail, other times Reeve leaves big gaps...the mother to his first children (were they married or not?), that Dana was 7 months pregnant when they wed...that kind of information. It is so pathetic to see such a proud, masculine guy being reduced to his status of celebrity cripple--being called &quot;inspirational&quot;by Barbara Walters. By the end of his memoir I was no closer to understanding how he bears this, but I did realize that his survival depends on the good will of others, so I can see how it is in in best interest to act grateful.	1998-07-10

It's when she gets to the more recent times, particularly the despicable Woody Allen's predation on her adopted daughter, that she tries to be lofty and ends up sounding trite. She makes sure we know what she thinks of Woody Allen's life on the analyst's couch (a weakness--one to which she does not in her entire life succumb until the woody-soon yi debacle). She sounds like she could use a few years of therapy herself, to gain some insight into herself--why she took so long to break up with Woody, why she feels compelled to undertake adoption after adoption of handicapped children; how similar a situation she got in to with Frank Sinatra as Soon Yi did with Woody; how Soon Yi's behavior is understandable when you realize she was completely abandoned in a big city, Seoul at age 5 (or 7--no one knows for sure where she came from or when she was born), only to end up in Ms. Farrow's small private orphanage. Come one, Mia! Punch the pillow! Give it to him! He seduced your DAUGHTER! You will be forgiven for being angry about that!	1998-02-07

Driven, talented, educated, successful--if only she had been a man. But Martha's not, that makes her a ballbuster. I enjoyed this book because it was so easy to read between the lines. Martha Stewart worked hard, made the real American Dream come true-to be wealthy, powerful, and famous. It's okay for Lee Iacoca or Donald Trump to do this--but not an Irish Catholic girl child of the fifties. Maybe it's not just that she's a woman, but that she's made her way to fame and fortune through homemaking--traditionally the most underesteemed and underpaid work. In other words, women's work. I admire her immensly, even more so after reading this book.	1997-11-16

When you read all the mountaineering books you can get your hands on, as I have, you'll learn that the chances of dying on a high altitude climb are EXCELLENT. The fact that they go to an area called &quot;the death zone&quot; should be a clue to this. You'll also find that on trip after trip of &quot;professional&quot; mountaineers, climbers die-sometimes many of them (read about the '82 season on K2, or the Russian Invitational climb in Pamirs (ALL pro climbers, LOTS of deaths) for some perspective. The debate over whether the deaths on this particular climb had to do with the participation of &quot;non-professional&quot; climbers is irrelevent.Also--interesting to read the press participant Sandy Pittman has gotten. With her espresso beans and laptop computer she's just a modern version of expedition pioneers to who brought fine wines and table linens on treks. t	1997-11-07

Full of stories of parents who go to extraordinary lengths for their children, I think it might make less self-extending parents feel guilty for not doing such things.

It is wretched and brings out the worst in people. The shortcoming and the strengths of the Irish come through Frank McCourt's narrative--literate and steeped in Irish songs and poems while subsisting on stolen apples and licking the grease and salt off of discarded fish and chip wrappings. From this book I understand the harsh humor and grim stoicism of my Irish Catholic family, and I appreciate the circumstances that motivate people to immigrate to the USA. I'm grateful my relatives escaped the potato famine. Also, we have come along in our understanding of alcoholism as a disease--but not far.
