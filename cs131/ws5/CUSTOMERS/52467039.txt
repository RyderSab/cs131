Then it turned into a sappy romance, two sappy romances actually, and it lost what little appeal it might otherwise have had.<br />I now realize that, as a general rule, when the author's name on the cover is bigger than the title, the book is not one I'm going to enjoy: Tom Clancy, John Grisham, Judith Krantz, et al ad nauseum.<br />Another bad sign is a title that's a line from a song, and these seem to be proliferating. Pass them up if you like good writing.	2004-05-03

The only reason to look at this book is for the pictures, many of which I've not seen elsewhere.<br />The text, however, is gush, gush, gush. The author repeats himself ad nauseum and quotes only people who haven't a single word to say against the great, the fabulous, the one and only legend! It gets tiresome. Yes, Judy Garland was a great talent, but how many times do we have to hear it?	2004-04-05

As another reviewer said, you will enjoy it more if you're sixty plus, fond of Shakespeare, and Jewish. I qualify on two out of three. The Jewish references were beyond my ken.    For a person nearing retirement, it's fascinating to see what some people do with their lives after full-time paid employment ends. After I retire, I plan to read all the great works of literature I've missed so far, and Shakespeare is on my list.     Gollob (he must hate it that so many people can't bother to spell his name correctly) took \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" far too seriously. After all, it was a romantic comedy. It was supposed to be fun! His criticism of its historical inaccuracies is like criticizing Shakespeare for his witches and fairies.    Gollob is a little too full of himself at times, but he must have loved writing this book and gently bragging about his achievements and the famous people he's bumped against over the years.	2004-02-09

I read recently about a Houston high school student with a B average who, enrolling at the University of Houston, could not make it through her freshman year because the courses were too difficult. She dropped out and entered a trade school.<br />I also read recently that the two states in the country that have the lowest requirement for proficiency on state tests are Colorado and Texas. To be considered proficient in those states a student need only achieve a reading score in the 13th percentile. That's the bottom thirteen percent.<br />I don't know what happened in Colorado, but I have a pretty good idea about Texas. The state tests in Texas were first administered to Governor Bush and continually dumbed down until the test writers came up with a version the guv was able to pass. That's the one that's used to test Texas students.	2004-01-20

There's no one here like Francis Bacon, Charles Lamb, Montaigne, or even Evelyn Waugh or Russell Baker. Few of these pieces appealed to me.<br />One that did, in a mild way, was \\"Country Cooking from Central France,\\" by Harry Mathews, a parody of painstakingly detailed recipes and cooking methods with descriptions of the scenery thrown in for culinary snobs. Mathews's recipe is for roast boned rolled stuffed shoulder of lamb (farce double). Farce, indeed. I wouldn't recommend trying it.<br />Another essay that was at least comprehensible was by a man belittling the glitter and excesses of the Indiana State Fair, which he seemed to view as tawdry. It sounded like sour grapes to me. There's something rather marvelous about the gaudy display of almost everything once a year at a really big state fair. My reference is the Ohio State Fair, one of the largest in the country. A visit to the state fair is a rich experience.<br />However, many of the pieces are more like prose poems than the essays I'm familiar with. One, by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha: Erato Love Poetry, was deconstructed to the point of rubble, which I wasn't able to reconstruct into any kind of sense.	2003-12-04

There are no episodes in which Dickens meets his characters or dead authors.<br />I read the Edgar Johnson bio years ago and loved it. Ackroyd's book, at least this edition, doesn't seem to go into as much detail.

In this book, William Safire has collected some of his &quot;On Language&quot; columns from THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE. About three-fourths of the columns are on word origins, a subject in which I haven't much interest, and about one-fourth deal with usage. In spite of Safire's conservative political outlook (he was a speechwriter for Nixon), he doesn't drag his political views into these language columns. He even praises Bill Clinton's careful use of words in certain circumstances. On the other hand, he voices no criticisms of George W's speech, perhaps because others have pretty fully explored the subject.<br />Many people respond to Safire's columns with letters of correction or criticism. Safire calls these people the Gotcha! Gang. I have a few Gotchas of my own.<br />On page 26, he quotes a Seth Leibshohn of Washington who claims the author of Goldwater's infamous &quot;defense of liberty&quot; line was &quot;a professor of political science at the University of Ohio . . . .&quot; There is no such place as the University of Ohio nor has there ever been such a place. Ohio houses five institutions of higher learning containing the name &quot;Ohio&quot;: The Ohio State University, Ohio University, Ohio Dominican, Ohio Northern, and Ohio Wesleyan. <br />On page 32, Safire quotes the following in a letter from Jack Fruchtman of Towson University: &quot;Madison's amendment dealing with congressional pay was eventually ratified on May 7, 1792, as the 27th amendment . . . .&quot; This is an obvious impossibility. If the 27th amendment was ratified in 1792, just a few years after the Constitution was adopted, then amendments 1 through 26 must also have been ratified by May of 1792. Those would include the amendments proposed after the Civil War, prohibition, and the ban on more than two presidential terms. The 27th amendment was actually ratified in 1992.<br />On page 74, Safire writes, &quot;MetLife includes baby boomers, now over fifty, in the mature market.&quot; Virtually everyone agrees that the baby boomers were born between 1946 and 1964. All baby boomers, therefore, are not over fifty, although Safire's commas indicate that they are. Had he omitted the commas, the statement could not have been faulted.<br />This appears on page 97: &quot;But stop when you come to the inflection point, which is what used to be known as a crossroads, as in the sage advice of the Old Managers, 'When you come to a crossroads, take it.'&quot; This sounds like a misquotation of Yogi Berra's famous &quot;When you come to a fork in the road, take it.&quot;	2003-10-16

The two set out on a quest to find a trace of Lily's mother's past. When they reach their destination, the female bonding starts, and the book gets boring. The beekeeping background and the religious rites involving a black Mary don't help.<br />Foolishly, I'm now going to try &quot;Life of Pi,&quot; another best-seller with animals.

One wonders how the Victorians ever acquired a reputation for prudery or ideal family life with one affair after another and second families scattered around the globe and their children farmed out to relatives or paid nannies. Perhaps Victoria herself was the only \\"Victorian,\\" yet who knows what really went on between her and \\"Mr. Brown\\"?<br />Here are Bulwer Lytton and his wife who, after marriage and two children, discovered they heartily hated each other and spent the next forty years, still married, but living apart, violently attacking each other in the public press and neither one of them caring a whit for their two children.<br />Lytton, a man whose literary works are now virtually forgotten, was once as popular as his contemporary Dickens but didn't have Dickens's talent for self-promotion. Lytton was quick to take offense and lost friends easily. He had a dour personality and was never a happy man, always feeling slighted by friends and the public alike.<br />Mitchell explores, in separate chapters, L's upbringing; his awful marriage; his children and their fates; his literary career; his political career, first as a radical, then as a conservative, and finally as Secretary of State for the Colonies (a post in which the author claims he did an excellent job); and finally his role as a prophet.<br />In a book that seems otherwise well written, there were too many typos and grammatical errors.	2003-09-25

I've owned a couple of umbrellas with ducks' heads, but I never found one with a parrot head.<br />When Disney announced that Julie Andrews would play Mary Poppins in a movie, I was shocked and appalled.

She writes about her growing years in the forties and fifties, not only as a baseball fan but also as a Catholic and a member of a neighborhood where everyone knew everyone else.<br />DKG is four years younger than I, and our early lives had much in common. I, too, grew up a Catholic and a baseball fan (the Cleveland Indians) and lived in a neighborhood with a butcher shop, a fruit and vegetable market, and two drug stores with soda fountains. Unfortunately, I didn't grow up to be a Pulitzer-Prize-winning author of political biographies.<br />If you grew up in a middle-class suburb in the forties and fifties, this book will make you yearn for the &quot;good old days&quot; when, in spite of the threat of nuclear destruction and Joseph McCarthy, life seemed simple, safe, and solid.

Her writing was very enjoyable and even humorous, but I'm always a little suspicious of cooks who say, &quot;Oh, it's easy.&quot; These things probably are easy for people who like to cook or at least don't dislike it. <br />I don't like to cook. Unfortunately, I sometimes get hungry, and I like to eat good food. Liking good food and not liking to cook don't go together very well. Lauri Colwin devotes an entire chapter to potato salad, a chapter she begins &quot;There is no such thing as really bad potato salad. So long as the potatoes are not undercooked, it tastes pretty good to me.&quot; I'm here to tell you that is simply not true. Colwin never had the misfortune of eating some of my early potato salads. For years, I made really bad potato salad, and the potatoes were not undercooked. What exactly was wrong with my potato salad? I wish I knew. I followed Mother's recipe. She made great potato salad, but mine tasted like dirt. Have you ever tasted dirt? It's nasty. Finally, I gave up potato salad (I don't care for supermarket potato salad) and just regarded it as a gourmet treat whenever someone else served it. About five years ago, I decided to try again. It was delicious. Now I'm not ashamed to take my potato salad anywhere, and it often gets compliments.<br />Sometimes I think the food knows when you don't want to have anything to do with its preparation and refuses to cooperate. I have a very long list of foods that don't want to cooperate. Reading Lauri Colwin's book isn't likely to make me a better cook, but at least it made me think it might be pleasant to be one. Her breadmaking saga is especially entertaining.	2003-09-12

Parts of this book read like an exciting novel: hunting episodes in Africa; lawsuit pitting him and wife Jean Simmons against Howard Hughes (the Grangers unexpectedly won but asked for no settlement except expenses); a western battle with his crooked ranch manager. He drops his share of names just to prove he can, but some people with \\"names\\" were actually his close friends: Michael Wilding was his best friend; Laurence Olivier was a close one. Granger was generous to his friends, with money, time, sympathy, and favors.<br />Like Robert Mitchum, Granger didn't have much respect for bad movies. He minded more than Mitchum having to do films he didn't like, but he always needed money.<br />One reviewer called Granger a B-movie star. \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" and \\"Scaramouche\\" were no B movies. Even Clark Gable was forced to make a few bad movies.<br />Granger, Mitchum, and Gable were always on time and always knew their lines. Granger and Mitchum didn't hesitate to speak their minds on the set when they thought something wasn't right, and for this they were termed \\"difficult\\" by some directors.	2003-09-02

We learn only the bare outlines of Minnelli's life with Judy Garland and little about any other romantic interests. His attitude toward Judy was one of sympathy, but he really didn't know how to cope with her. She was a difficult person to live with. You can tell Minnelli really dotes on daughter Liza, and he even lets her voice into this book, quoting a lengthy interview he and she gave to a reporter. Liza sings well, but I've never enjoyed listening to her talk. I've never heard her say anything interesting about herself or her life.<br />Minnelli, on the other hand, has many interesting things to say about his life and career. He begins with his boyhood and tracks his career to the present. His approach is much like that of star biographer Gary Fishgall. Every job, every Broadway production, every film, and his role in completing each is described in satisfying but modest detail. He includes his failures as well as his successes. I find this much more interesting than who slept with whom.	2003-08-25

I wouldn't go that far, but it was pretty exciting. I started reading this book at lunch on August 14, the day of the blackout from New York to Detroit. In the story, there are frequent blackouts, though none as long-lasting as the New York blackout. The difference is that in the city of Ember, when the lights go out, there is no sun, moon, or stars to alleviate the pitch blackness. The generator that supplies power to the entire city was built to last 200 years, but 240 years have passed, and it can't last much longer. Food and other supplies are becoming scarce.<br />The original builders of the city left \\"instructions for egress,\\" but over the years these were lost until one day a baby finds them and starts chewing on them. The instructions are rescued by the baby's sister, but not before the baby has consumed parts of the message. Will Lina and her friend Doon decipher the message in time to escape?<br />The book, as I said, was very exciting, but thinking too hard about the unanswered questions in the story could ruin it for you. It's not so important to know why the city was built under these conditions. I can accept that there must have been a good reason. It's harder to accept that people are eating the contents of 200-year-old cans of food. A can of fruit recently bulged at both ends and leaked a foul-smelling liquid in my cupboard, and it wasn't even 20 years old. There are huge gaps in people's knowledge.

Wells tells everything that's known about Shakespeare's life and speculates on additional possibilities. All that could have made a book by itself, but it's only about a third of this volume.<br />He also goes on to tell about the writing of the plays and their staging through the centuries. Something I've not seen elsewhere in one volume is a discussion of the many famous actors who've played the major Shakespearean roles. <br />Above all, this book goes down easily.

He's written about James Stewart, Burt Lancaster, and Gregory Peck. Fishgall seems not very much interested in [physical activity] and social name-dropping, which is fine with me. He gives the bare facts of the actor's social life without the juicy and sordid detail for which many people read star biographies.<br />On the actor's professional life and accomplishments, Fishgall is excellent. He covers childhood and youth thoroughly as it relates to the future career. He discusses every professional job the actor ever had. You learn not only about the big successes, with which you may already be familiar, but also the small successes and the failures. Nothing relating to the professional life is left out. You learn what the subject thought about his coworkers and what they thought about him.<br />I have now read two of Fishgall's bios and plan to read the third. This is just the kind of information I find fascinating. If you enjoy any of Fishgall's bios, you may also enjoy Vincente Minnelli's \\"I Remember It Well.\\" Minnelli's story-telling mode is very similar to Fishgall's. He dwells on his professional life and downplays the personal.	2003-08-08

Parts read like Thoreau's &quot;Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers.&quot; Those parts contrasted oddly with the humorous parts, which drew forth an occasional chuckle and told of the adventures of three ill-prepared men on holiday traveling up the Thames because they thought a week on the water in a boat would be a pleasant excursion. The trip was not an idyllic one, though it had its moments. The misadventures suffered by our three incompetents are what give the book its chuckles.<br />I like Jewett, Thoreau, and an occasional chuckle, and this book gave me a couple of entertaining evenings. <br />The subtitle of this book is &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog.&quot; I don't know why the dog was dragged into the story. He added nothing, and I found the parts about the dog annoying. At least, the dog parts were few.	2003-06-27

People who find out I read a lot sometimes ask, &quot;What's the best book you ever read?&quot; That is a question that's impossible to answer. I might be able to name the best baseball book I ever read or the best Jane Austen novel or the best biography of a political figure or the best historical fiction set in the middle ages or the best teen-age romance. But if anyone ever asks me, &quot;What's the funniest book you ever read?&quot; this one will be my answer.<br />This is the only book I've ever read that made me laugh out loud so hard I cried at the same time. This happened during the scene in which Adrian is contemplating running away and/or committing suicide and feeling exceedingly sorry for himself. I felt at the time it was cruel of me to be laughing over this poor adolescent's pain, but that just made it funnier. I was sitting at the kitchen table at the time, and the other members of the family who passed by thought I was nuts and said so.<br />Everyone's sense of humor is different. I like my humor dry and understated. I can't stand slapstick. I was about forty when I read this. Maybe you have to be old enough to look back on the agonies of adolescence and not give a rat's tail to enjoy this book.	2003-06-24

One doesn't circulate, and the other is always out, so I broke down and bought this. I only wanted to read it because I love gossip. I didn't expect much of the writing because this is an oral history, and I wasn't disappointed. However, you wouldn't want the authors/editors to do too much editing, or the voices wouldn't sound natural. But when one of the people from the show who's labeled \\"writer\\" says, \\"Each one was their own boutique,\\" I cringe. <br />Some of the reviewers don't give the compilers of this volume much credit. I think they deserve more. First they had to do a lot of legwork just to get interviews with these people and get them to talk about meaningful stuff. I assume they taped all this. Words don't just jump from an audiotape to the printed pages of a book. All the \\"and-ums\\" had to be deleted. Probably some of the language had to be cleaned up. Useless repetition had to be cut. All this editing had to be done without killing the spontaneous feel of the material. Seems like a big job to me. My only complaint about the authors is that they're a little too reverential in their short pieces between the speakers.<br />The first time I ever saw Saturday Night Live, I thought the musical act was one of the comedy sketches, and if I hadn't been told differently, I'd think so still. My son-in-law tells me he's heard other people say the same thing. If the musical acts are supposed to be taken seriously, they're completely out of sync with the rest of the show, none of which is to be taken seriously.<br />The one thing that almost every speaker dwells on is the fame and money garnered by the players who went on to become big names in entertainment. Fame and money are their gods. There's no mention of whether these successes ever did anything of quality. ... Not one of them has been on a level with Walter Matthau, Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams, or Bill Cosby. And no one ever even mentions the one Oscar nomination to come out of this company: Dan Ackroyd's performance in \\"Driving Miss Daisy.\\"<br />I've never been a big fan of SNL. My favorites were Gilda Radner and Phil Hartman. I absolutely loathe(d) Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, Chris Kattan, Rob Schneider, David Spade, and John Belushi. They are or were all loud, stupid, vulgar, and disgusting. But I still watch occasionally, hoping to see something funny. I seldom do. The commercials are overlong. The music is awful. The humor is never subtle. When did vomit become funny?<br />Nevertheless, I think the book is worth a read, especially for those who are just aching to know what went on among these people after hours. It's a long book but a fast read.	2003-06-24

We learn that Annie Oakley did not deliberately lose a shooting match to Frank Butler as she did in &quot;Annie Get Your Gun,&quot; a product of the unfeminist fifties.<br />The information on the trials of Oakley's early life was especially interesting. I felt the book bogged down when the author began trying to fit Oakley into a feminist straitjacket, relating everything she did and didn't do to its connection with women's rights.

They didn't even have names but were referred to by their jobs.<br />Their discoveries on a strange planet were also not interesting. One could hardly make any sense of them. When the men finally learn what the planet is all about, that, too, is disappointing and not interesting. <br />The only reason I give this book two stars instead of one is that the writing wasn't terrible.	2003-06-03

The memories were generally happy ones, no abuse, no divorce, no deaths. One reviewer called Zippy's family dysfunctional. I didn't see them that way. The father gambled and drank and had no visible job, but these facts hardly seemed to affect Zippy. Her mother spent all her time reading, and one year the family's artificial Christmas tree was still up in late March. Sounds perfectly normal to me.<br />Some reviewers complained about the incidents of cruelty to animals and Zippy's lack of any religious principles. Neither of these aspects of the book bothered me. I thought the animal incidents and descriptions were the only boring parts of the book. So what if she had no religious feeling. If you haven't got it, you haven't got it. I could sympathize with Zippy's boredom in church.<br />The book was mildly entertaining and a fairly pleasant way to fill a long afternoon.	2003-05-27

No one else has read it. That's because it's almost unreadable. The type is very small. The author cannot have omitted a single scrap of his copious research. His selection skills need honing. People with only remote connections to EG, and many with no connection at all, are discussed in tedious detail.<br />This book is definitely not for the common reader. The details may interest other scholars, and the author is probably justifiably proud of all the new facts he's unearthed, but these do not make for compelling, or even interesting, reading by ordinary fans of literary biographies.	2003-05-23

But I am a reader, and I've read and enjoyed most of P. D. James's books and the other books she discusses.<br />James kept a diary during the year she was seventy-seven. She records what's happening in the present and reflects on aspects of her past. In the present, James is constantly traveling, giving talks, and spending time with friends old and new. She appears to be a very busy person. All this traveling about, though not exactly boring, is not exactly fascinating either. To me, the more interesting parts were about the past and especially her thoughts and opinions on other writers, mainly mystery writers. Ms. James is another big fan of Jane Austen's, and an appendix gives the text of a talk she gave to the Jane Austen Society on mystery in EMMA.<br />Ms. James's outlook on life is that most things were better in the past (with the big exception of sanitary protection). She appreciates her relatively good health and independence and is grateful for each day, storing up good memories to sustain her as she grows older.<br />James is too refined to speak ill of anyone and is unwilling to reveal personal details about her life with a mentally ill spouse. She is quite willing to share her opinions on public issues, but she's reluctant to give us the inner P. D. James.<br />Still, I was more interested in this book than the other one I was reading at the same time, V. S. Naipaul's A HOUSE FOR MR BISWAS.<br />If you're a mystery fan, you'll probably enjoy James's remarks about other mystery writers of the past.	2003-05-20
US	52467039	R2BWRZ421IJ3SC	0374186294	40376325	Byron: Life and Legend	Books	3	25	41	N	N	Legend, Yes, but Why?	This is a very good biography, full of facts and devoid of speculation. However, reading this biography of Byron, one gets the feeling that perhaps he should have been castrated at birth. Women begged him for his sexual favors and young boys were not immune to his amatory attentions. After a few hundred pages, the litany of B's conquests becomes tiresome and almost boring. Readers who are not interested in the sexual excesses of famous poets won't find much to engage them here.<br />The author's subtitle is \\"Life and Legend,\\" but if you are one who admires Byron's poetry, I'd suggest avoiding this book. It might make you admire Byron the person much less. The book doesn't really make clear why Byron's poetry was such a sensation or what made Byron a legend. Perhaps he was charming, but we see little evidence of his charm in this book.<br />Elizabeth Taylor once said that when she first met Richard Burton, she resolved not to become another notch on his belt. She succumbed anyway. Byron, apparently, never met a woman--and few men--who didn't pant to become a notch on his belt.<br />Chapter 22 begins \\"...[Byron] was sick of promiscuity.\\" About time! He is now 31 years old, but any resolve to avoid promiscuity that might have attached to this sentiment didn't last long. He and Teresa Guiccioli (a married woman) jumped into bed at their third meeting. At least he stuck to her longer than to any of his previous amours, though not uninterruptedly, and she was no saint herself. It all sounds quite sordid.<br />Byron's death is very affecting. The doctors probably killed him with the barbaric contemporary practice of bloodletting.<br />The author quotes occasionally from Byron's poems but doesn't discuss or analyze any of them.<br />A more generous use of commas would have improved the readability of the text.	2003-03-28

I'm usually not much interested in descriptions of scenery, but in SFOC, I found them enjoyable and integral to the plot. Here, the descriptions just sat there, doing nothing.<br />Here is a man who is planning to kill himself but gets quite bent out of shape when he cuts his head in an auto accident (wasn't he wearing a seat belt?). I laughed out loud.<br />He seems quite concerned about his injured dog but seems to have no feeling for the birds he wantonly shoots. <br />The story went nowhere, and the few possibly interesting characters Ben meets along the way are not developed.	2003-03-07

Even a science dummy like me should have heard of the possibility. This novel was not set far enough in the future (about 2020 for the trip) to make the space travel believable.<br />Many reviewers have complained about the quality of the writing. I hadn't realized so many s-f fans cared about writing quality. To me, the writing didn't seem any worse than the writing in most contemporary fiction, although two instances of \\"ahold\\" did take me aback.<br />Like many others, however, I found the character of Anne Edwards irritating--a universal mother hen as well as an outstanding professional in her work, a great cook, and an enthusiastic sexual being in her sixties. People like that may be comforting in real life, but in fiction they're always irritating.<br />Then there's the main character, Sandoz, a Jesuit priest who can't understand a God who lets bad things happen to good people. Get over it already! Bad things have been happening to good people ever since Eve was tempted by the snake. What's new? Physical torture and sexual abuse occur on a daily basis all over the world. Why should they be so much more terrible because they happened to him?<br />Then there was the unjustified and unmotivated antagonism of the ecclesiastical authorities back on Earth who were ready to believe the worst of Sandoz on very flimsy evidence before they'd even heard his side of the story. Shades of the Inquisition in 2060!<br />Then there was the music that first attracted the group of humans to the alien planet. They thought it was beautiful and spiritual, but it turned out to be poems in praise of torture and pornography set to music. Some music critics!<br />In spite of the many irritations, the book did keep me turning the pages.	2003-03-07

There is room for legitimate argument here, and I prefer to call such a word a possessive adjective. To me it is far more adjective than noun and so the noun part of it can't be an antecedent for a later pronoun. Therefore, I agree with what the reviser of Follett's book says rather than with what he does. Another man, who was once an English professor at Ohio State (Corbett, I think), and for all I know may be there still, also frowns heavily on the use of a possessive noun or possessive adjective as an antecedent. One must simply find a way to reconstruct passages that tempt one to break this commandment.<br />I once read Follett's book from cover to cover. The man (not he) was an elegant writer. Nowadays I dip into it to refresh my memory and to find passages to use as arguments in pointing out the writing faults of others.<br />Description is a fine thing, but I'm a member of the prescriptive school and so am perfectly happy with Follett's edicts. When several people are working together to produce a single book or series of books, they must all be following the same path.<br />My only objection to Follett's book is the lack of an index. His section titles are not always straightforward or descriptive, so some things are hard to find.	2003-02-26

I discovered Miss Read last year in a Christmas display at the library and have now read ten of her books. Miss Read is the kind of writer you want to read lying in a hammock on a summer day or wrapped in an afghan on a winter evening or in the spring or fall when the sun is making patterns on your wallpaper.<br />There are no dysfunctional people among Miss Read's characters, no sex, and no crime. But these omissions do not make Miss Read's stories sappy or sentimental. Miss Read's characters are ordinary people living ordinary lives, and they are delightful. Her stories are completely satisfying and full of simple pleasures. (This sounds disgusting, doesn't it?) But Miss Read has a bit of an edge that keeps her characters from becoming excessively sweet.<br />If you like Jan Karon, you may like Miss Read. I myself could not read Jan Karon because she was too treacly.	2003-02-25

No one sets out to be a hero; it is something thrust on a sports star by fans and the media. Both fans and the media will lick a player's boots one day and spit in his eye the next if he doesn't live up to their image of him, on or off the field. (In Columbus, Ohio, this is a weekly occurrence during the college football season.)<br />So DiMaggio wasn't a nice guy. He wasn't much of a talker. He was dull and boring. His friends were low-class punks. He was sexist. He was unfaithful. He was mean spirited. All of this you will learn from Cramer's book. But you will also learn the details of DiMaggio's glorious baseball career: game-by-game accounts of his 56-game hitting streak; details of his hitting, fielding, and base-running styles; running commentary on big games. If you're interested in DiMaggio's baseball career, this book gives you a lot.<br />When I read the words \\"elegantly written\\" in the Amazon review of this book, my jaw dropped. This is one of the most inelegantly written books I've ever read. Open the book anywhere, and you'll find examples like these:<BR>p. 152: Big games, it was like the whole city went.<BR>p. 153: Hell, by that time the early birds already had half a load on.<BR>p. 153: ...if you didn't like them, why'd you come to his joint?<BR>p. 154: Toots...would drink with them till they got their full load on.<BR>p. 156: The way she dressed, classy.<BR>p. 156: That's what paid the freight.<BR>p. 156: Joe wasn't the kind who could scratch that itch for her.<br />This is elegant writing? Perhaps Cramer wrote the book with the audio version in mind. His slovenly and annoying diction probably sounds better than it reads.<br />My advice is to read this book for the baseball and take the rest with a grain of salt or skip the nonbaseball parts entirely.	2003-02-21

I kept wondering who would read this book, but I see from previous reviews that quite a few people, both children and adults, read it and enjoyed it.<br />All the characters have strange names--Hermux Tantamoq, Linka Perflinger, Tucka Mertslin, Ortolina Perriflot (alias Blanda Nergup), Pup Schoonagliffen, to name but a few. Why is that, dear author?<br />Occasionally the author forgets himself. He has Hermux with paws on one page and fingers on the next.<br />Basically, I enjoyed the story, a fast-paced mystery with plenty of action as well as tender moments.<br />What I really longed to see were some illustrations of the many fascinating characters. Although Hoeye does an excellent job of describing their clothing and appearance, I yearned for some pictures a la The Wind in the Willows.	2003-02-12

I find it difficult, at best, to visualize the progress of battles, even with maps provided, but if this sort of thing is your cup of tea, you should enjoy the book.<br />Magnuson is a fine writer, but this book contains little in the way of human interest.

Like Gross, I love books about books. Like Gross, I read a lot of comic books in my youth (mainly Wonder Woman) and, later, mysteries (all of Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie and many more). Like Gross, I thought there would always be time later to read the classics, and also like him, I tend to pick up whatever catches my eye at the library. Now I'm 63, and although I've read much of the great stuff, there's still much to be read. My tastes don't run to T. S. Eliot and Gross's moderns but backward to the nineteenth-century English novelists and beyond.<br />Gross has a pleasant, low-key style and, it seemed to me, a realistic take on childhood and its memories.	2003-01-16

Both used the word &quot;lucky&quot; in their titles. Both had strong, supportive fathers whom they loved. Both had serious diseases, though Fox's is fatal and Channing's was an apparently curable cancer.<br />The big contrast between the two books is in the quality of the writing, the depth of emotion, and the self-understanding. In spite of the fact that Fox was a high school dropout (though he later got his GED) and Channing spent two years at Bennington College, Fox's book is wonderfully well written while Channing's is just as gushy as you would expect if you've ever seen her on or off stage. <br />Michael J. Fox has been through a lot. He had the good sense to get himself help for his alcoholism and his emotional problems and to profit by that help. Now that he's exposed his Parkinson's, he shows no signs of sniveling or begging for sympathy but is out there beating the bushes for money for research to help everyone with PD now and to come. He's not embarrassed to let the world see what PD is doing to him and to others. Underneath the shallow exterior he exhibited in his TV and movie roles, this guy is as solid as a rock.<br />Fox also had the intelligence and maturity to see the showbiz world for the unreality that it is and not to fall victim to it or let it overwhelm him. Another contrast with Channing is that the parts Fox sees as unreal appear to be the only &quot;real&quot; life Channing has.<br />You've really got to admire this man.	2003-01-14

It is written in understandable English. As another reviewer has pointed out, Stone's version is most like the medieval one in its structure, its use of alliteration, and the rhyme scheme of the bob and wheel. Tolkein, in an appendix to his version, gives a clear and enlightening explanation of the principles of this kind of poetry. Once you've read Tolkein's explanation, your appreciation of the poem will be greatly enhanced. Nowadays, many poets and others turn up their noses at alliteration, but I love it. So the language is one of the things that make the poem such a pleasure to read.<br />Another thing that makes Gawain a great read is that it is just a darn good story. When a green man riding a green horse and carrying his own green-haired head gallops into Arthur's dining hall, you know there's going to be some drama in this tale. And there is! There's some hunting and killing of animals for the sportsperson and the bloodthirsty. There's romantic temptation, and there's suspense.<br />One reviewer speculated on possible symbolism in the novel. The search for deeper meanings might interest some readers. For me to &quot;get&quot; a symbol, it has to jump out of the book and bite me on the nose.	2002-10-10

Then I read some of the Amazon reviewers' comments and began to read more critically. <br />In the photo section is a picture with the caption \\"Pregnant on the fields and downs of Dorset, 1921.\\" Maybe I read the first part too fast, but I don't recall anything about a pregnancy. Two photos share the caption \\"Recovering from her operation on the porch of Eugen's house in Croton.\\" What was the operation for? Did I miss that, too?<br />There is a hint that Millay's mother, Cora, may have had affairs during the periods when she left her three daughters alone.

JWH's autobiography has none of the former and plenty of the latter, yet it is exactly right for what it is, the autobiography of a notorious gunfighter who thought the easiest way to solve any problem was to kill the problem. You only had to look cross-eyed at Hardin, and you were a dead man. Yet, as John Wesley tells his story, every one of his forty-odd killings was justified. The reader almost feels sympathetic...	2002-10-04

It's also published, without illustrations, in five paperback volumes. I read only THE TUDORS AND STUARTS, which had no illustrations other than two or three maps and graphs. The first half of the book, about the Tudors, was written by one man, and the second half, about the Stuarts, by another. The volume was short, only 142 pages. <br />This is my favorite period of British history and the one with which I am most familiar, but still, I found the text confusing. I think there were several misplaced lines of type in the second half. Maybe a writer can't do much in 70 pages to elucidate a period, and probably the illustrations would have distracted from the sketchy text. The writing was not lively.<br />The very last section is called \\"Intellectual and Religious Life,\\" but it was mostly about religious life. Literature is almost totally ignored throughout the volume. Pepys is never mentioned.<br />There is no index. Perhaps the complete, one-volume version has an index, and the publisher didn't want to go to the trouble of compiling indexes for the individual volumes. Still, a history book without an index is unthinkable.<br />On the whole, the book was disappointing.	2002-09-26

Derwent May has written a 550-page tome (not including index and bibliography) tracing the 100-year history of the Times (of London) Literary Supplement. I once had a trial subscription to the TLS and enjoyed reading it but couldn't afford the subscription price. The best comparable thing we have in the U.S. is the New York Review of Books. (The NYRB, though it's less expensive, gives you only 20 issues a year while the TLS gives you 52.) The London Review of Books is not a good substitute: Fewer than half its pages are devoted to actual book reviews, and this periodical has the annoying habit of not following any rules for breaking words at the ends of lines. The New York Times Book Review is unsatisfactory because the reviews are too short. The New Republic is a good read if you want some politics and current events along with your book reviews. Amazon.com is a great place to get book reviews if you want the opinions of John and Mary Doe. But I digress.<br />May divides his book into convenient time periods. For each time period, he first discusses the people who were employed by the TLS, the format and format changes of the TLS during the period, and then the reviewers and important books reviewed. This last is the best part of each chapter, although the other parts are also interesting.<br />Two sections of photos show TLS personnel and reviewers and four photos of the TLS itself as its format changed over the years. I would have liked to see more photos of the paper itself.<br />The index could have been expanded to include the titles of books reviewed. One can't look up a favorite book to see if it was reviewed (and what was said about it) in the TLS.<br />On the whole, CRITICAL TIMES is a thoroughly enjoyable read.	2002-08-12

The authors of this book claim that the study of the classics (Greek and Roman) is dying, or already dead, in American universities. This may very well be true. But beyond that, I failed to get their point.<br />First they argue that no other civilizations have anything better to offer for an explanation of the life we live today than the classical Western ideas of Greece and Rome. No argument there. That is why the West is dominant in the world and why others envy us and many wish to emulate us (or destroy us).<br />One chapter quotes many books and articles by modern classicists. These quotations are laughable in their incomprehensibility. This, I believe, is the authors' point, and it is well taken. But so what? No one but other academic classicists could read this stuff, and they probably don't understand it either.<br />They seem to believe that no professor of classics actually wants to teach but only to find ways to get time off (with pay) to write incomprehensible books and articles.<br />The authors have a lot of spleen to vent in regard to the study and teaching of the classics, and they've vented it. I hope they feel better. They have my sympathy, but it's unlikely that their book will have any practical effect.<br />They go on to say how difficult it is to learn Greek or Latin and that without visiting ancient sites and soaking up classical history, the student can't really \\"know\\" classics. It seems a lot of work for someone who just wants a college education to secure a better job. Most people can't afford to luxuriate in the classics for four years only to find themselves without a usable degree.	2002-08-09

Her views sometimes differ from those of other well-known critics, but her reasoning seems sound. For example, many critics believe that Jane Austen failed in her portrayal of Fanny Price in MANSFIELD PARK by making her too good. Waldron argues that Austen knew exactly what she was doing and that a careful reading shows that Fanny is not as good as she appears on the surface. The famous Austen irony is at work in Fanny's character.<br />Waldron, thankfully, refrains from Marxist, feminist, and Freudian critical readings of Austen's texts. She uses no incomprehensible jargon. Perhaps she is part of a trend. We can hope.	2002-07-30

One is about the relationship between the author and his wife. The second is about the politics of medical funding. The third is about Parkinson's disease, its symptoms, its progress, and its treatment.<br />The first story is mildly interesting. I find the ambitious Kondracke more interesting than his wife. I used to read Kondracke's pieces in THE NEW REPUBLIC and watch him on THE MCLAUGHLIN REPORT. He hasn't exactly ended up with the life he thought he wanted. In spite of his devotion to his wife, he must have occasional regrets about the things he hasn't achieved. He chose Milly, and he's sticking to her. It's what any decent person would have done, but many of us are not so decent.<br />The politics of medical funding was the dullest part of the book, and as a previous reviewer has said, no disease is without its advocates. It would be great to fund them all to the max, but it's not going to happen.<br />To me, the most interesting part of the book was the information about the disease itself and its effect on one real person, how she coped, and how she fought. <br />The Kondrackes appear to have plenty of money for additional caregivers, household help, and educations for their children. Everything is easier with money. I do not mean to belittle the suffering of this family, but I wonder what this experience is like for those who are less well off.	2002-07-23

If you just looked at the sample pages provided by Amazon, you'd think it is nothing but a collection of quotations of people's opinions of Jane Austen. Well, there are a lot of opinionated quotations, from people you've heard of and people you haven't heard of. There are also Q&A interviews with knowledgable JA fans and actors who've played JA roles. There are quizzes.<br />Most of the pieces are short, so it's a good book for readers with limited attention spans. The book also has a magazinelike format: the pages are bordered, and there are insets and decorative separators between chunks of text.<br />I was delighted to learn that two columnists I admire, Miss Manners (Judith Martin) and Edith Lank, who writes about real estate and appears in our local house-and-garden section every Sunday, are big fans. That explains why I like them.<br />There's quite a lot of information in this book in spite of its \\"light\\" look, and it's entertaining, but if you prefer sustained discussion and development, you'll want to choose another book.	2002-07-22

A young English nobleman, a second son, though his father's favorite, decides to see something of the world and begins traveling on the continent with a friend. He signs on with the troops of Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, who's aiding German Protestants against, I think, the Catholics. This ten-year period occurs near the end of the Thirty Years War. My knowledge of seventeenth-century European history is practically nonexistent, so I didn't really understand the issues involved and didn't learn much more from this book.<br />In Part II, our nameless hero returns to England, where the Civil War between the Cavaliers (the king's troops) and the Roundheads (Puritans) is about to get underway. (It was at the end of the Civil War that Charles I was beheaded, after which the Commonwealth took over for eleven years until the restoration of Charles II in 1660.) I thought this part might be more interesting, as I do know something about English history, and it was.<br />Like A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR, this book, too, has a fictional narrator in a historical setting.

It does not take on the &quot;cultural catastrophe&quot; or deal with the &quot;revival of higher education.&quot; Hart has his favorite works of Western thought and literature and discusses them intelligently and entertainingly but does not relate them to what is now going on in college classrooms, as his title suggests. What he does is relate religious thought and texts to secular thought and texts  throughout the centuries. He compares and contrasts the religious ideas of the Judeo-Christian tradition to the secular ideas of the Enlightenment and modern works as embodied in Homer, Moses, Socrates, Jesus, St. Paul, Augustine, Dante, Hamlet, Moliere, Voltaire, Dostoevsky, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. If you're interested in the ideas of these people and their works, you should enjoy the book.<br />Of course, the title Hart chose (or maybe his publisher chose it) is more likely to sell books than a more accurate title would.<br />Hart's only reference to cultural catastrophe is this line in his afterword: &quot;multiculturalism is an ideological academic fantasy maintained in obvious bad faith.&quot;	2002-06-10

Gallafent makes a plausible case for continuity and development from one musical to another. Even as you find his arguments logical and believable, you know Hollywood doesn't work that way. Few people expect or want anything more from an A & R movie than the unalloyed pleasure of the singing and dancing. Gallafent even manages to connect the films Rogers did without Astaire (of which there were many more than I had realized). In spite of his quirky premise, Gallafent is interesting and entertaining throughout, and the book is chock full of stills from the films.	2002-06-10

Fanny Trollope was the mother of Anthony Trollope, perhaps the most prolific English novelist of the nineteenth century and my favorite. Fanny's husband was ineffectual in the breadwinning department, but fortunately for the family, Fanny herself was energetic and enterprising. She took one of her sons (not Anthony) and an artistic young man to the United States. She was planning to join a friend of hers who was a mover in setting up the utopian community in Harmony, Indiana, but the place turned out to be squalid, and she didn't stay long. <br />Fanny spent most of her time in the U.S. in Cincinnati and in her book is very hard on the city and its inhabitants. She especially objected to the pigs' role as garbage collectors. (In those days, pigs roamed the streets freely, like sheep grazing.) Fanny felt most of the people she encountered were loud, dirty, vulgar, and fanatically patriotic. It is her vivid descriptions of the physical conditions and the people that give this book its historical and entertainment value.<br />While she was living in Cinci, she opened a retail emporium and filled it with rather shoddy merchandise sent from England by her husband. She also attempted to bring culture to the inhabitants. Not surprisingly, both ventures failed.<br />After Mrs. Trollope returned to England, she supported her family by writing novels that were quite popular at the time, though they haven't become the classics her son's have. She spent her final years living in Italy with another son and his wife.	2002-04-03

It begins a couple of years before the Depression. The Rileys (Pop, Mama, sons Gail, Ken, and Frank, and daughter Mary) have just bought a new home and are set to live happily ever after. Pop has a heart attack and loses his job. He and Ken repair radiators out of their basement. The Depression sets in. Gail goes to Oklahoma to work in the oil fields. Frank mows lawns. Mama takes in washing. Gramaw moves in and does sewing. They manage to continue meeting the mortgage payments of $33 a month. On a trip home from the grocery, Ken and Frank are held up by a black man with a gun. (His family is hungry.) The boys give him half their groceries. The Klan finds out about it, beats up the black man, and drags him over to the Rileys for identification. Ken lies and tells the Klansmen they have the wrong man. The Rileys are Catholic, and the Klan hates Catholics almost as much as blacks. When the mortgage company goes belly up, the new mortgage holder (a Klansman) demands full payment ($2000) of the Rileys' home loan, and the family is forced to give up their home and move to a rental in a poorer section of the neighborhood. <br />Throughout these troubles and others, the family support each other. This novel contains no abuse, no alcoholism, no sex, no four-letter words. It is entertaining, well written, and satisfying.<br />I see Bickham has also written some fifty other books: mysteries, westerns, books on writing, but few people seem to have read him. It is their loss.	2002-03-28

Traill wants to dislike Schliemann, and he succeeds. Is the author biased, as a previous reviewer believes, or was Schliemann really such a rat? It's hard to trust this writer.<br />It was a struggle to get through this book. I wanted a life of Schliemann without so much about the technicalities of archaeology, which I found confusing and uninteresting. Only brief glimpses of Schliemann the human being appear.	2002-03-20

Shays's Rebellion is referred to as both Shays Rebellion and Shays' Rebellion. <br />I thought this book might more appropriately have been marketed to the young adult market. Its lack of specific detail and its repetition diminished its interest for me. We are told that Abigail managed the farm while John was away, but what exactly did she do in managing the farm? We are told that she taught her children at home for a time, but what did she teach them? Perhaps such details are not available, but that doesn't excuse the repetition. How many times do we need to be told that Abigail missed John when he was away from home? Once or twice would do it for me.<br />I'm afraid I admired Abigail Adams more before I read this book than I do now. This is not a biography that makes you feel as if you're living with the subject, and the writing is pedestrian.	2002-03-19

My title refers not to the book but to the idea that millions of people buy and, I suppose, read this kind of stuff. I made it to page 132 but could not bear to read another sentence. Mindboggingly unrealistic characters, dialogue, and action. Perhaps it takes a male reader to appreciate Cussler, Clancy, and Ludlum.	2002-01-23

In my opinion, both teens and adults could read it with profit. It covers much of the same ground as Bud Kliment's book but goes into a little more detail. All the photos are grouped together in the middle of the book, which is probably a less appealing placement for teens.

I have known three people (one of them my father) who had one leg shorter than the other since childhood and walked with distinct limps. Their limps never prevented them from doing anything they wanted to do. It seems highly unlikely that this boy would have been permitted to stay out of school. <br />Second, the descriptions of the music didn't make me feel anything; they were just words. I've read writing that sounded like music, but this wasn't it.<br />Third, there was no explanation for the parents' behavior, why they left, or why they returned. In real life, the boy would likely blame himself for their leaving.<br />It has occurred to me that the last page and a half may be meant to take place in heaven after the boy has died of starvation.	2001-10-29

If you're a bad speller, it won't help you any more than all the rules you were taught in school but never learned. If you want to spell correctly, consult a dictionary or a good speller.	2001-03-23

It is unusually designed and weirdly illustrated. It's great to have all these wonderful prefaces in one handy volume, but Gray, who supplies an introduction and many of the glosses, writes in a kind of shorthand, staccato style that is unpleasant, and he has weak control of comma usage. I might have bought this book except for Gray's writing style.	2001-02-05

This is one of those biographies in which the writer assumes that the subject's life is reflected in her fiction. It's a chore to separate the fictional quotations from the actual life. It's also one of those annoying biographies that is full of phrases like &quot;She may have. . .&quot; and &quot;We may assume that she. . . .&quot; When the biographer has no facts, she puts her subject into the contemporary scene and then suggests activities for her that she may or may not have engaged in. This method of writing biography is dreadfully out of date.	2001-01-22

The reviewer said he couldn't put the book down. I didn't have that problem. The book was average in every way. I got the impression that these sisters were quite shallow. The most startling thing in the book was the discussion of the Boer War and its aftermath without a single mention of the black South African population.	2001-01-11

Perkins and Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Marvelous	Max Perkins was the emperor of editors. I'm an editor myself (of textbooks), and Editor to Author, a collection of Perkins's letters to many of his writers, taught me how to deal with authors in order to get the best out of them. Two things about Max and Marjorie especially struck me. One was the difference between then and now in speed of communication. We'd never have these wonderful letters if Max and Marjorie had been using email or the telephone. The other was the insensitive attitude toward blacks. These were two educated and sensitive people. They didn't even realize what they were doing or saying. It seems horrible now.<br />I have worked on textbooks in which the writing process is a prominent feature in teaching students, and it is made to sound deadly dull, but the writing process makes a fascinating subject when it's discussed by Max and Marjorie.<br />I gave up a night's sleep because I did not want to put this book down.	2000-10-17

Too many references to Vidal's good looks: twice in the same paragraph in addition to every dozen or so pages. Too much repetition--of the good looks, of the dropped names, of the  same old childish feuds reopened and redissected too often.<br />And yet there  seemed to be some serious omissions. No mention of whether Gore's  grandfather, T. P. Gore, was related to the Tennessee Gores. No mention in  almost 800 pages of the House Un-American Activities Committee or Joseph  McCarthy and his infamous hearings, although Vidal was a person intimately  involved in both Hollywood and politics.<br />I rarely think a book is too  long, but for this one, I'll make an exception. The book was too long.	2000-05-17

Ride with Me was nothing but an excuse for Doig to make a little money from all he knows about Montana, a state whose geography holds no interest for  me. The characters were unpleasant, and the plot was thin. The old man is  nasty and cantankerous without justification. The lovers end up exactly  where they began, so all that happens between them during the novel cancels  out. The hours the characters spent driving around in that truck brought  back many painful memories of the boring vacations my sister and I were  forced to take with our parents to see the country. Dull, dull, dull! I'd  have given this a minus score if that were a possibility. Zero is too good  for it.	1999-08-02

When a murderer goes to the trouble of doctoring his corpse to prevent dental or fingerprint identification and then leaves a note identifying the victim, something is fishy. But no character questions this odd  discrepancy. Where are the real police in this story, the ones who should  be investigating the murder? This is just the first of many unrealistic  details throughout the book. When the real villain and murderer finally  reveals himself, he talks too much. I suppose this is Lott's way of letting  the reader in on what the point of this tiresome tale has been, but even as  the villain himself says, it was just boring old money.	1999-07-28
