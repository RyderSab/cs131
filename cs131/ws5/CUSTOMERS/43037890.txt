I now no longer feel like I'm fumbling around in the dark about dietary suppplements and MS!  Dr. Bowling thoroughly and objectively examines supplements and their effects on MS!  How empowering it is to know that certain supplements have the side effect of nausea, which is my most frequent and bothersome MS sypmtom and the one thing I simply can't cope with.    No more Evening Primrose Oil for me!  I've replaced it with Flaxseed Oil, which does basically the same thing, but unlike Evening Primrose Oil does not have nausea as a side effect!    I would gladly trade more physical disability if I just could find a way to do something about the nausea!    And even more important information, supplements that stimulate the immune system.  Also of importance is the information on which supplements can cause liver damage, particularly important for those of us who are on one of the interferons!       With Dr. Bowling's excellent book in hand I am adding herbal supplements to my regimin, and I do notice a measurable improvement in my overall condition!    However, as all us MS'rs know, our lovely little disease has a tendency to go through periods when it kicks our butts less than at other times, and with that knowledge, I'll do an update on this review towards the end of this year.     Obviously, highly reccomended to anyone with MS!  I'd pretty much put this in the category of a must-read book for my Sisters and Brothers with MS.    Doesn't having MS absolutely STINK?????    10/19/05  As promised, I'm updating this review.  Well, so far the improvement is continuing.  Actually, I think it's a combination of several different things.  I feel that the fact that I workout 4 to 6 times a week is also very beneficial!  So this book still rates a 5+ with me!	2005-07-07

As a femminist I should object to the way this book portrays womyn, but this book is just so darn good, who cares about the other stuff.<br /><br />Ever since I first read this book when I was around 9 or 10 years old, Rebecca has haunted me.  Is she angel or devil, victim or vllian?<br /><br />Here's an interesting spectulation.  Perhaps she was a Lesbian forced into marriage with a man.  The book certainly makes it clear that Mrs. Danvers was in love with Rebecca.  And when Maxim is telling the second Mrs. DeWinter his version of what Rebecca was like, he even says that Rebecca wasn't normal.  And given the time this book was written, homophobia was completely acceptable, perhaps even, coupled with male pride, a justification for murder.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is the way Manderly is another character in the book.  The presence and energy of Manderly are  just as crucial as the humans in the story.<br /><br />What an incredible job Daphne DuMaurier does in creating her claustrophobic little world.  A world, which in spite of everything is full of glamour and romance.<br /><br />How I long to have tea under the chestnut tree at Manderly on a perfect summer's afternoon!  I think I'll wear my new summer frock with the flowers and that wide floppy hat...I wonder if Frifth will serve.<br /><br />And, of course, Rebecca is simply the most perfect hostess...Aren't the DeWinter's the perfect couple?<br /><br />What lies beneath the surface of Manderly?  Read Rebecca and find out.	2005-02-23

My ex friend parted us.  I've always had the feeling that \\"we were meant to be.\\"  I've also always had the feeling that I've been her mother, because I felt so very maternal towards her.<br /><br />I did the Lifetime Convergence spread and found out:  1.  I've been both her mother AND her father.  2.  It was Divine Fate that brought us together.  3.  The nature of our Karmic Bond is to help each other grow and learn.  4.  Also, as I've suspected she and I have never had any romantic bond between us.  It's always been a blood bond, except for this lifetime.<br /><br />This is just a suggestion about a way to get the most out of this book.  In my opinion, using a non-traditional Tarot deck works better with these kinds of spreads.  I use my Shapeshifters deck or my Arthurian Tarot for the spreads in this book.  Those two decks really seem to lend themselves to past-life and karmic explorations.<br /><br />So if you want to really explore you past lives using Tarot, this is a great book for doing it!	2005-01-29

This book is many things.  It is packed with fascinating historical facts and loads and loads of good information.  The writer does a fairly good job of reporting the facts, but that's pretty much the only thing he does do a good job on!<br />By the same token, here is the main thing this book is not.  It is not objective!  While it is obvious that Dr. Hutton did a lot of research for this it's a real shame he has so little objectivity about his subject matter.<br />If a person is writing a scholrarly book on a given subject they should be objective!<br />He categorically dismisses modern \\"earth mystics,\\" of which I am one!  His attitude towards Neo-Pagans is unfailingly condescending and patronizing.  He devotes a fair amount of this book to praising Christianity and trashing the religions he is writing about.<br />He also makes sweeping generalizations.<br />He also contradicts himself.  He states that the Sheila-Na-Gigs found in such abundance in Ireland could not possibly be of ancient origins because they are quite ugly.  But the pictures included of ancient Deities are just as unattractive as the Sheila-Na-Gigs!<br />There are numerous other contradictions as well.  If you read this book, keep an open mind and come to your own conclusions.<br />One last thing that I found quite annoying.  He routinely referred to pre-historic figures of males as Gods, while figures of females were rarely referred to as Goddesses.	2003-09-02

This book has one main point to make and makes that point ad nauseum!  Basically, this book seems to say that there is absolutely nothing that can't be completely healed by Reiki, including cancer and problems with animals!<br />The writer's state that the effects of Down's Syndrome, which they call Mongoloidsm, can be healed with Reiki!  The mere fact that they refer to Down's Syndrome as Mongoloidism is offenseive.  This book was written in 1985 and by then that term wasn't used anymore.<br />Then there's the constant use of he, him, his,  and mankind to refer to all humans male and female.<br />There is some valuable information in this book, but not a lot.  They state that Reiki cannot be taught by reading a book.  So I wonder why they wrote it.  This is the first book I've read on the subject and I'll probably buy more books and videos since I'm interested in the subject.	2003-09-02

As a femminist Wiccan I figured that since this was about Biblical figures, I wouldn't like this book very much, but this book is so wonderful that it transcends anything like that!    Now this is my kind of mythology, tons better than the actual Bible!  Dinah's story is so moving and powerful.  I can't imagine any Wombon of any faith that would fail to be deeply moved by this WONDERFUL Mistresswork.    My favorite parts are the times when they are in the Red Tent and sharing Wombonlore and Goddesslore.  I also really, really, like the parts about the different Birthings that take place.  The Birthing Song is lovely!    I like this book so much that I've ordered a copy for myself!    If a die-hard, radical femminist, Witch like me likes this book, you know it must be good!	2003-07-11

The parts where she describes the postulant being naked, blindfolded and bound, not to mention being scourged, sound more to me like bondage and S and M, NOT A RELIGOUS PRACTICE!    And there's the ritual where Death scourges the High Priestess and she falls in love with Death, after he beats her is quite offensive to me!    I also find her claim that this stuff is ancient to be somewhat suspect! It's pretty much been proven that Wicca is a new religion! She also uses the word \\"warlock!\\" That word is an insult to male Witches, since it means oath-breaker!    Some of the other things I found objectionable was one of the so-called Laws where it states that men should rule womyn!    As I said, I'm glad I only read this book out of curiosity. It is interesting and the parts I like are the different rhyming spells she has. I'll probably make use of some of the rhymes.    To sum it up, my objections to this book are it's sexist and degrading attitude towards womyn and her claim that Wicca is an ancient religion.	2003-05-09

The only thing in it that's at all different from every other book on basic Wicca is the part about mind-reading.    The main problem with this book is the witer's claim that \\"dark is not evil\\" is an original premise.  One of the main things about Witchcraft is the balance of dark and light, night and day!    To anyone who is at all familiar with the Wheel Of The Year, the Dark and the Light are celebrated equally!    The only thing of any interest are his mind-reading techniques.  That would be interesting to try and see of they work!    Other than that the book is valueless. Don't waste your money!    But in all fairness, I don't think his target audience is 46 year-old womyn! Perhaps young men might enjoy this book.	2003-02-26

I'm a Wiccan and so am used to the metaphysical books I read giving me credit for being a grown-up!  In other words, they SUGGEST, rather than COMMAND!<br />I also feel that it would have been more inclusive if she hadn't repeatedly used the word \\"God\\" to refer to Deity and the personal pronouns \\"he\\" and \\"him\\" instead of the unoffensive and non-sexist s/he and him or her, which are, again, what I'm used to in the metaphysical books I read, unless the books are aimed specifically at one sex!<br />Also, her attidude is very, \\"Oh, let's just all be light all the time!\\"  An example of this is her instruction to use a flower as a means of psychic self-defense!  In my opinion, that's not very practical.  I generally use mirrors!<br />But if you can get past all of that stuff the book has a lot of valuable information on how to maintain your aura and chakras.  It also has a lot of good stuff on releasing issues, people, past events, etc.<br />Since her attitude is very annoying, I doubt I'll buy another book by this writer!  So if you're a Christian or a member of a religion who uses the word \\"God\\" as the only word to refer to The Divine and doesn't mind The Divine Female being completely excluded, you might enjoy this book!<br />If you're a Wiccan, or indeed a member of ANY Pagan religion, you might find this book annoying!	2002-12-27

This book is really, really good AND really, really boring and predictable!    What's good about it are the parts where the author, who obviously did a lot of research, writes about the customs and the life-style of the Anaszi.  As a Wiccan who is interested in the Ancient Ways and Native American beliefs, I really enjoyed that part.  I feel I learned a lot of things that I can incorporate into my own practices.  However, I found the potrayal of the Anaszi as ignorant and superstitous rather offensive!    As a life-long, voracious reader, I just want to say that I don't like romance novels!  Damsels in distress bore me!  Especially if they're in distress because of some incredibly stupid thing that they did to GET themselves into distress.  I also prefer heras(femminine of hero)who rescue themselves without a BIG, STRONG(and of course, INCREDIBLY HANDSOME,(who is also a passionate and expert lover)MAN to save them!  I find the romantic adventures of Kwani(She's a wee bit promiscous!  The time span of the novel seems to be appx. a year and a half and she has five lovers over the course of it.)boring!  I also think that she's an idiot for getting together with Okalake when Woshee(one of the few people who treats Kwani well)has volunteered to share in any punishment that Kwani may incurr by breaking any of the rules of the Eagle Clan!  See what I mean about getting themselves into distress!    When I read the book, I found myself hurrying through the parts that were about the loves of Kwani-Who-Doesn't-Seem-To-Remember-That-For-Every-Action-There-Is-An Equal-And-Opposite-Reaction.  I know that this particular law hadn't been discovered yet, but the Anaszi obviously believed in the interrconnection of ALL life, which is pretty much just another way of stating it!  This book is fairly long, but it is fast reading!    Basically, this book is just a long romance novel with a twist!	2002-08-12

This book is very absorbing and well-written. Ms. Moura is obviously very knowledgable on the subject she is writing about and since she has an MA in history that is not surprising! The things I like best about this book are the way she reveals in a logical, believable, manner how the whole much-touted \\"Judeo-Christian\\" religous system is based on myths borrowed and/or stolen outright from what went before! I also found very enlightening how she explains that the reason that European Paganism strikes a deep chord of familiarity in people who are European or of European descent is because of the simple fact that we are European or of European descent and not Middle Eastern or of Middle Eastern descent! I always wondered why ever since I found Wicca I was so easily able to accept all the teachings. It's nice to know why Christianity NEVER worked for me or made sense to me, even when I was a child attending Catholic schools. A lot of the other reviews trash her research methods. I find her conclusions and her INTERPRETATION of the facts to be logical and reasonable. The only objection I have to this book is simply a difference in personal preference. I felt there was a little too much emphasis on The God and all of His attributes and not enough emphasis on The Goddess and all of Her attributes. In other words too much Shiva and not enough Shakti! This book also does a great job explaining how the whole power of religous orthodoxy got started and why. One last point, isn't it unbeileiveably ironic that the rantings and ravings of the piece of human garbage known as adolf hitler about the superiority of the Aryan \\"race\\"(on this planet there is only one race and that race is the citizens of the Planet Earth human and non-human alike)and how horrible and evil the people of the Jewish race (funny, I thought Judiasm was a religion)are when it turns out the Jewish people are actually of Aryan descent! I don't know whether to laugh, cry or scream!  Update:  I've just been reading through the other reviews and most of the people who trash this book use the religously bigoted terms of BC and AD instead of the terms BCE and CE that Ms. Moura uses throughout her book!  That pretty much makes their credibility and objectivity level non-existant!  Don't let their narrow-minded reviews stop you from buying this excellent book!	2002-02-28

I am in the process of buying and reading all of the books in a book called The Well Read Witch and this book is one of the books mentioned in that book.  I would agree with it's inclusion as a must-read for Witches.  My review states the reasons.    This book is very interesting and quite accurate in the way it explores the INCREDIBLE DIVERSITY of the Neo-Pagan movement and of the people who are Neo-Pagans!  She keeps her own views to a minimum and simply reports on the movement as a whole.  I find it very telling that Ms. Adler did not start out as a Pagan, but simply set out to write a book about the Neo-Pagans and ended up becoming one herself!  It is absolutely true that most of us tend to believe that the other people who share our spiritual beliefs also share our political and moral beliefs, too.  But it ain't that way!  This book is a must-read classic for all Neo-Pagans and it would be nice if people of other religions would read it, too and learn about who we really are and what we really do!	2002-02-28

When I first started this book it got on my nerves a little bit because of the writers' penchant for telling Witches things like, \\"since you're a Witch, you should feed the wild animals.\\"(Witches DO NOT like being told what to do!)  Then as the book went on and this tone continued, I started to get really annoyed!  So when I got to the part where the authors' warned that \\"you shouldn't work with a Dark Deity because it might be dangerous,\\" I was really, really offended.  Hecate and Badb are awesome!  Then when the authors stated that you could worship Jesus as God and still be a Witch, I really questioned the thinking of the two womyn who wrote this book!  I wonder how they can work this into the teachings of Judeo-Christianity which state amongst other things, \\"Thou Shalt Have No Other Gods Before Me!\\" And the Christians also warn against practicing Witchcraft.  As I understand it, belief in Jesus as God, automatically makes one a Christian.  How can you be a Christian if you don't intend to follow some of their basic principles and teachings?  If you want to read a good book about basic Witchcraft, read books by Edain McCoy or Ann Moura's Green Witchcraft series.  Don't waste your time or money with this one!  However, if you want to keep this book on hand to convince uneasy friends or family members that Witchcraft is just a harmless diversion, buy this book!  The information it presents is fairly accurate on the whole, but for the above-mentioned reasons I feel that this book is quite worthless!	2001-12-10

Am I the only Witch who finds the idea of Witches worshipping Jesus illogical?  If one believes that Jesus is God, that automatically makes one a Christian.  And the Christian religion certainly does not accept Witches!  I also find the terms BC and AD offensive. How about using BCE and CE, especially if you're a Witch? If this were the first book someone read on Witchcraft, they would get the impression that Witches worship Jesus and might decide to stop exploring The Craft. The information in this book is pretty basic, although it does cover a wide range of topics. If you want information on basic Witchcraft, then read books by Edain McCoy or Ann Moura's Green Witchcraft series! Don't waste your time or money on this one! One last point: Oh, let's all just be light all the time, which is the attitude of this book, is hardly realistic, and is perhaps even somewhat dangerous!	2001-11-13

The title of the book is The Law Enforcement Guide To Wicca and it's by Kerr Cuhulain. In his book he talks about the author of this book, and I use the term author loosely! The following information is taken from his book. Fact 1: Elaine's full name is Edna Elaine Moses and she is a confirmed fraud who was never a Witch. She has several aliases. Some of them are Edna Moses, Edna Bailey, Edna Gnost and Elaine Moses. She made many claims which could not be substansiated. Fact 2: &quot;Dr.&quot; Rebecca Brown's real name is Ruth Bailey. The Medical Licensing Board of Indiana met on 10/2/1984, to consider Bailey's license to practice medicine. They revoked her license (#29402) for misdiagnonosing patients. &quot;Dr.&quot; Brown claimed that her patient's illnesses were caused by demons, devils and other EEEVIIIL (emphasis mine) spirits. Bailey was found to have administered massive overdoses of Demerol and Phenobarbital (does the term drug addict mean anything to you?) to herself and to her patients and to have falsified patient's charts and hospital records as well as misleading other medical professionals regarding her patient's condition. A psychiatrist appointed by M.L.B. diagnosed Bailey as suffering from demonic delusions and/or paranoia schizophrenia. After losing her medical license, Bailey adopted the name Dr. Rebecca Brown and she and Elaine began to tell the story of how Elaine was a former High Priestess of a Satanic cult and how Dr. Brown had rescued her from a hospital full of Satanic cult members. I only wrote this review to inform Christians with a firm grip on reality of the facts about &quot;Dr.&quot; Rebecca Brown. And please find out the truth about Witches! We worship Nature and the Scource Of All Life and not Satan, we don't even believe in Satan! Bright Blessings To All!	2001-08-24

A better title would be something like: Group Dynamics In Wiccan Covens And How To Deal With Interpersonal Conflicts In A Wiccan Coven.<BR>The part of this book that includes an evaluation of how dangerous a given group is was quite funny. Turns out that the the mainstream religions are far more &quot;cult-like&quot; than Wicca. So when you tell someone you're a Wiccan and they tell you that you belong to a cult, give them a copy of the evaluation form in this book, and watch 'em squirm, at least if they evaluate their own religion honestly! This book is an absolutely essential book for coven leaders, and members, to read. Along with Covencraft by Amber K, which IS about the nitty-gritty, day-to-day stuff on how to start, organize and run a coven and Inside A Witches Coven by Edain McCoy, which is a wonderful book in helping a person decide if they should join a coven or not, these three books contain invaluable information.<BR>I cannot stress enough the need to find out everything you can about coven life before you decide to join or start one! Speaking from personal experience, when everything is working being in a coven is of the best experiences a Witch can have. When everything is not working out, being  in a coven is one of the most painful experiences a Witch can have.<BR>These books will make you think of things you would probably not have thought about on your own. Don't be naive enough to assume that all Witches will act ethically and kindly all the time, lest you end up sifting through the wreckage of a group you helped found!<BR>All three of these books should be in any coven's library! Thank Goddess I found them and the three of us are who are left are now in the process of rebuilding our group.	2001-08-22

But it does a great job in helping someone decide whether or not to JOIN a coven and what kind of coven to join.<br />I have two other books on Wiccan covens, Covencraft and Wicca Covens.  Each one offers something unique.<br />Covencraft is about the nitty-gritty, day-to-day, business of running a coven.  Wiccan Covens is about the psyhco/social aspects of coven life.<br />But if you're not sure if you want to join a coven or not, you should read this book. It's a great place to start exploring covens.	2001-08-22

And what a glorious past it was!<br />A past when The Great Mother was revered and worshipped by all, instead of by isolated pockets of Womyn (and non-patricarchial Men), a past which honored Our Sacred Womyn's Bodies, a past in which all of the Mother's creatures, human and non-human alike were treated with respect, a past in which Her rivers ran free and Her skies were clear and Her Sacred Breath smelled sweet...<br />How amusing to see our world through the eyes of that fabled creature an Amazon Warrior! How ridiculos we look!<br />But the religion of The Great Goddess is being Re-Birthed!!! And I am helping it to happen!	2001-08-14

Edain McCoy is one of my favorite Wiccan authors and this is one of her best books.<br />As always, her writing is very readable and is very reassuring to those just starting to read Wiccan books who may still have some misconceptions about the Craft.<br />My understanding of this book is that is her take on Celtic Womyn's Spirituality today and EMPHATHETICALLY NOT INTENDED to be a book on how Celtic Womyn actually MIGHT have practiced their spirituality before the Burning Times!<br />Many of the things are truly lovely and I've used some of her ideas in planning rituals for the Dianic coven I'm a member of.	2001-08-09

I've loved Dark Shadows since I was ten and, along every other kid I knew I watched it every day!<br />This book is interesting because it tells the story of Angelique's childhood on Martinique and what happened in her life before she came to Collinsport.<br />I am an actual real-life Witch and the things that Angelique does aren't even close to what we do.  We are bound by the Wiccan Rede to &quot;Harm None,&quot; and I don't think she ever cast a circle when she did a spell!  We also don't worship, or even believe in, Satan.<br />This is a great book, but highly innacurate about Witchcraft.  She will always be, in my opinion, the most interesting of all the Dark Shadows characters and I never liked Josette much anyway!  What a spoiled brat!  How Barnabas could ever have chosen Jossdette over Angelique...go figure!	2001-08-01

I am in the process of buying all of the books mentioned in a book about books, called The Well Read Witch.  This book is included in that book.  I agree it is a must-read for Witches.  I give the reasons in my review.    All Womyn should read these extremely beautiful, empowering and life-affirming meditations.    I've used some of the wonderful \\"found Goddesses,\\" in spells I've done and it's been quite effective!  My favorite is General Terminatrix!  Great for banishing rituals!	2001-08-01

But her information on candle colors is good and her information on crystals is very interesting, although again I question why she has info on crystals in a book that is supposed to be about candle magick!<br />I still think that some of the spells are positively revolting! The worst one involves taking a dead toad or frog(I forget which one)and putting the carcass under a dung heap until all the flesh is eaten away by maggotts and then using the bones in a spell!!! (Hmmm...next time I find a dead toad or frog, I think I'll take the body and save some of my dog's dung)! How much dung would I have to collect to make a dung heap and just how much could it stink? I can't imagine the neighbors objecting!<br />This is the kind of stuff that gives Witches a bad rep!<br />It's obvious that the author is very knowledgable, but this book should definetely have a different tile!	2001-07-31

The mere fact of it being an all-female deck is fabulous! Hmmm...wonder if they have something comparable for Men.<br />I think this deck could be used very easily for meditation and spellwork as well divination.	2001-07-31

The coven I belong to, and helped found fell apart recently, leaving us with three members, one of whom is currently on a Sabbatical.<br />I wish I had read this book BEFORE my friend and I had started our group! I'm currently going through the book page-by-page and when I'm finished the other active member will do the same. Then we'll start to look for more members.<br />NEVER, NEVER, start a Witch's coven without first reading this book!<br />Particularly helpful is the section on Coven Offices and By-laws. Also the section of problem personalities is quite enlightening, having encountered the Adoring Accolate and the Drama Addict in two of our former members.<br />There are two other excellent books which should also be part of any coven's library.  They are Wicca Covens:  How To Start And Organize Your Own by Judy Harrow and Inside A Witch's Coven by Edain McCoy.  The title of the first book is somewhat innacurate.  A better title would be Group Dynamics In Wiccan Groups And How To Handle Disputes.  The second book, Inside A Witch's Coven doesn't have a lot of information that I consider useful in starting or running a coven, but it is a great book to read if you're thinking of joining a coven and helping you do decide what kind of coven to join!	2001-07-31

Edain McCoy is one of my favorite Wiccan authors and there is nothing wrong with writing stuff for beginners! After all, everyone has to start somewhere!<br />I find the book to be well laid out and the information to be useful. The Witch Bottle works, but if you're going to do it, use a VERY small jar(unlike me)!<br />I also had some very magickal experiences while doing the elemental meditations.<br />The reviewer who suggested reading works by Crowley neglected to mention that Crowly was a Ceremonial Magickian and not a practicioner of Natural Magick! Ceremonial Magickians have Elemental Weapons instead of Elemental Tools. They tend to command rather than request, summon rather than invite.  They are not bound by the Harm None Rede of Wicca.	2001-07-31

It intrigued me so much that I am planning to find out more about it!<br />I don't know if it's the first book people who have just become Witches should read, I think it might be a little too complex for absolute begininners, but it's a great book for someone who already has some basic knowledge about The Craft of the Wise.	2001-07-27

I don't think it's as good as some of her other books, but it certainly isn't horrible! Several of the other reviews say she invented Witta, actually she joined an already existing Wittan coven in San Antonio, which she talks about in her book Inside A Witch's Coven, which is an excellent book. The information in her book isn't unique, but the prespective is. A kind of an Irish Green Witchcraft might be a good way of describing this book. The section on knot magick is interesting and informative. However, if you want to see Edain at her best read Celtic Women's Spirituality or Making Magick: What It Is And How To Do It, which are both 5 plus star books. Also really good by her are The Sabbats: A New Approach To Living The Old Ways and A Beginners Guide To Astral Projection. Older isn't neccessarily better! And since Paganism was pretty much destroyed by the early Jews and the Christian Inquisition, no matter how much research we do, we can only guess. Even if Paganism hadn't been pretty much destroyed, people wouldn't still be practicing it it the same way as they did ten thousands years ago! The only constant in life is change. So give her a break or, better yet, write a book about Witchcraft and see if you can get it published!	2001-07-25

For instance:  defining pantheism.  Even though the book is basic, she covers a lot of information and makes one want to explore more complex paths.<br />I agree with her view that humans don't need any intemediaries between themself and the Divine Creatrix.  I also really like her Back To Basics approach to Witchcraft.<br />Even though I'm not a solitary, all of the rituals can be adapted for group use and I've certainly cast circles and done spells by myself!	2001-07-24

This book is one of the books listed as a must-read for Witches.  I wholeheartedly agree with that and list the reasons why this is such a good book in my review.    This book is full of lots of ideas on how to celebrate each Sabbat.  I can't imagine someone not finding at least one idea they like a lot for each Sabbat!    I like the way she includes recepes in most of her books!  My coven uses this book as a starting point in planning our Sabbat rituals!    As always, her writing style is readable and enjoyable.  Edain McCoy is a very reassuring writer for a new Witch to read who might still have some lingering fears or misconceptions about The Craft.	2001-07-24
