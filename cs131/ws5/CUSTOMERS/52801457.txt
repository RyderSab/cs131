I enjoyed the character development of the main character.   This is something that Ian's has developed since in his writing.

I'm glad people want to remember the positive parts about Judy.   I think the positive parts out-shined the good parts.   But, at the same time Judy was not an angel.

My trouble with the book is that it could have been so much more.   Both female characters could have had whole novels written about them but we never get beyond of the surface of either one of them.   You got a favor of the riches and depavity of old Indian culture but no details.   Again my major fault is not that the book was bad but that the book itself hinted at what it could be but wasn't.	2001-09-06

Always wanted a fictional account of this affair that didn't borrow heavily from Marlow.   My main flaw is that I was never drawn into the story.   I really never care about the characters.   In this  sense, the characters were too historical and not fictional enough.   It is  difficult to write an engaging fictional account about the people of an  interesting historical event.  Although Hunt does this better than most  people, I still felt like I was reading a great history book rather great  fictional novel.	2000-07-06

In fact, I wished Spong had  talked about the churches in the United States that have allready gone down  the path that Spong suggested and what has happen to them, i.e. Christain  Science and Unity.

In fact, most people who haven't studied economics in college seem fasinated by the idea.   However, because of the way most Economics  are taught in College, most people who have studied Economics want nothing  to do with it.   I know many intelligent people who hated Economics in  college and have steared clear of economics every sense.   This is a is the  sorry state of Economics that has to die as Paul so clearly writes about in  his book.    I don't think, however, that the orginal intention of  economics, the study of how to allocate scarce resources will ever die.    His book, about its death really gives me hope that Economics will come  alive again someday once we rid economics of all the ego driven,  engineering models, that bore people to death of economics.	2000-05-31
