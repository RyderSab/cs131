We dont like to admit it is true or admit that we are shallow and superficial, but as a society, we are.   I've seen relationships break up, simply because one of the partners gained weight. We are living in a era where the media constantly provides us with an \\"ideal\\" and we are programmed to seek that \\"ideal\\". This is a great book in terms of motivation to lose weight and other forms of self improvement.  Overweight people are facing a lot more than just health risks, they are being judged negatively and labeled. This affects their lives on many levels .i.e. career, income potential, sexual desireability and the list goes on and on.  The author encourages people to upgrade their appearance, because, like it or not, that is how we are judged. Appearance is the first \\"filter\\" that people use, to determine how they will interact with you or IF they will interact with you. A good book for overcoming the denial thinking that looks dont count. think-again	2005-02-17

First of all, this book is funny and well written. The thing that really stood out for me in this book was that it gives you an accurate idea on what to expect from age 50 on. Being in my late 50s, I can see from personal experience that these authors know what they are talking about.  Living in Las Vegas I see men with what we call in Las Vegas  \\"buffet bellys\\" (huge gut) I seen old people so overweight and out of shape that the only pleasure they have left is gorging themselves at buffets.  The science in this book makes very good sense.  This book should be a \\"must read\\" for anyone entering their 50s-60s who is intrested in staying alive, possibly missing some of the scairest of the diseases and being able to have a sex life in their later years. I cant recommend the book enough for that age group of men and women. I meant to give this book 5 stars, but I cant seem to change the ratings	2005-01-16

The premise of the book is that nobody wants a doormat.  There are a lot of \\"nice\\" men who get dumped for being too nice and end up being male \\"girlfriends\\" to women, instead of lovers. The super nice, sweet, overgiving, aways available male ends up destroying  \\"chemistry\\" in relationships. The few male dating gurus use a lot of similiar ideas that are found in this book, altered to a male's prespective. The bottom line is simply nobody respects doormats (male or female) over the long haul: ...PERIOD.   Women also lose interest in \\"wimpy/wussy\\" men ( translates: needy) just the same as men lose interest in overgiving, super needy women and move on to some \\"bad boy/bitch type respectivly. This is an excellent book to understand and clairify these psychological principles. We have been taught by society to try harder, be more available, be more of a \\"friend\\" etc.  Obviously, with a 56% divorce rate..something is very wrong with those basic tennants..without respect, there can be no long term lasting relationship of any kind.	2004-09-27

This book is very good and a novel approach to losing weight.  I think this book is especially good for the past fifty crowd. Its easy and fun.   The pedometer that comes with the book is pretty cheesy..I would recomend getting a better one from a sporting goods store.  Overall the book is well written clear, except in figuring out the mega-steps.. That could have been written a little clearer.  Overall the book tells the truth about weight loss and gives a plan to keep it off.  That is the problem...keeping it off.  Much better than the fad diets that get the weight off but since they are so restrictive the weight eventually returns and then some.  This book gives you the tools and knowledge to only have to get the weight off one more time and then know how to keep it off. Excellent book for anyone stuggling with obesety.	2004-09-18

Iam really getting close to actually being completely debt free.  I would have never believed it possible, five years ago.  It is such a fantastic feeling to know that you do not have to work a 9-5 everyday just to survive. This course truly gave me my life and freedom back. There are people with vested interests; who would prefer you never know the information contained in this set.  I noticed the financial planner's negative review. With John's program you dont need the \\"service\\" of a  finanical planners..saving a lot of money right there. This program is designed for the average person who does not understand what a heavy debt load really means to your future. A reviewer mentions homes going up in value and thus a great investment,  Homes do go up in value, and yes, you can make a  profit, but replacement homes also go up in value so the profit increase usually means breaking  even, unless your moving to the country. In addition, living in Las Vegas, I ve seen homes almost double in value in 15 months and I seen the market crash again and people upside down on their homes and losing their tail.  Again, incurring massive debt is the sole REASON  people are stressed out, cash poor and total slaves to a job,living in constant fear they might lose. Who needs it?? If you have $2000-$8000 in living expenses going out every month, that is really  your personal freedom draining out and when you realize that 80-90% of this is usually interest that is making someone other than yourself very wealthy, it should make you more than a little angry. This course is the very way of thinking to obtain your freedom. This course is your ticket out. I cant recommed it enough. Update: in regard to the Ludwig review following mine. No, I am not the author, and I have no vested interest.  Mr. Ludwig's attack on myself and the book, suggests he has a strong interest in trying to steer people away from the widsom contained in this course.	2004-07-28

This book is just a continuation of the Castanada myths. This is a difficult book to take serious, unless your new and naive to Castanada's writing and are still entralled by the myths. Donner's book is just another typical Castanada story with a slightly different twist to it, in order to sound original and credible. This technique has worked well for a whole slew of parasitic writers that re-write the basic Castanada themes and present them as original and make a ton of money off the gullible.

Also there is an excellent chapter on what type of relationships to avoid and learning the history of potential partners to predict the future of the relationship.  This is not a woman bashing book in any sense and women would be well served to read this great book..It really gives the nuts and bolts of what happens in relationships and how/why they go wrong.

The problem about becoming friends before entering a relationship is it becomes very difficult to go from a friendship into a romantic relationship.  I believe that this book is written by a man, that has been influenced by what he thinks women want.  The fact is most women dont know what they want. This leads to the problem of trying to be something that may or may not be right.  Women, like men want to be turned on by someone...they are not looking for friends,  ideally during the process you become friends and lovers but the platonic/advice giving/exchanging type relationship goes nowhere 90% of the time.   In fact, if you develop a good friendship first with a woman, she will not let it become intimate because of fear of \\"ruining the friendship\\"  this is a well intentioned book, but not helpful in  the real world.	2001-11-15

The Return of the Warriors is a useful book in terms of explaining the basic of Toltec thought.  This is very important.
