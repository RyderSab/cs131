I thought it was a beautifully written and insightful slice of an era.  That being said, this book is really pointless.  The characters are no longer new and fresh and the whole novel feels forced.  Why did the author not leave well enough alone?  If he had something new to say, this could be excused.  But the book seems to have no reason to exist except to make money.	2005-10-08

They must be 'plants' from the publisher because this was truly one of the worst books I've ever read.  I'm a huge fan of historical fiction and this seemed like a great scenario.  But the writing is horrific.  The author can't string a coherent sentence together.  But worse, I blame the editor for this mess.  Having the point of view shift in mid-paragraph is not only infuriating, it's complete incompetence.  Do yourself a favor and skip this!!	2004-06-04

There was no need to write a sequal -- and this book seriously damages the wonderful feeling I had about this author.<br />What was muted and understated in Plainsong feels merely shallow and undeveloped here.  There's no addition to the perfectly formed characters of Plainsong that cried out for this nonsense.  Granted, it's pleasant enough to read -- but in comparison to the shimmering brilliance of Plainsong this book feels like a cheap way to cash in on a good thing.<br />Do yourself a favor if you really loved Plainsong -- SKIP THIS!!	2004-05-07

My problem is with the lack of any tension in the plot.  Nothing happens!  We have a story of a boy in the middle of nowhere who is unconditionally accepted by his father, gay friends and relatives.  Heck, even the children in this story never question his lifestyle.<br />Although it's nice to see such a perfect world without predjudice and homophobia, it just doesn't make for particularly interesting reading.	2003-10-12

Another Paul Russell novel, another story of older lecherous gay men draining the lifeblood out of teenagers.  Does this author have the ability to write characters with any dignity?  Do all of his gay characters need to live in a rarified world where the hunt of sex justifies any action no matter how deplorable?<br />Beyond the distastefulness of the subject matter, an even larger issue is the author's inability to give his characters (gay or straight!) any depth.  They are merely cardboard cutouts acting without any genuine motivation.  Max, Perry, Kyle, Donna, Leanne, Elliot are all one-note characters that act simply as plot devices to move along a laggard storyline, rather than showing any kind of complex thought or emotion.<br />There are some wonderful gay novels out there that don't whitewash the gay experience, yet don't debase it either.  And there are some wonderful gay authors who take the time and have the ability to put the human experience in deeper, fuller context.	2003-09-12

But maybe I set my expectations too high.<br />While this book has many glimpses of insight and lovely writing, it ultimately is a letdown.  I found that changing the story's point of view diluted the impact of all of the characters.  And Rose remained an enigma until the very end.  It never realistically told us WHY Rose had to run away.<br />Enjoyable on a certain level, but nowhere near the transcendence of Magician's Assistant and Bel Canto.	2001-11-30

But this was the most ineptly written book I've read in years.  The characters are so incredibly one-dimensional that you can't remember a single point of their lives.  <br />The plot, though, is the bigger problem.  What could have been a fascinating story about a subject most people have never encountered is instead turned into a series of awkward speeches.  It reads more like an educational treatise on tolerance than a novel.  A huge waste of time -- not even enjoyable as mindless reading.	2001-11-16

The characters are ridiculously 2-dimensional, without a  genuine characteristic among them (a HIV-infected, former porn star?  Give  me a break!!)  The writing is an embarassment -- when the author is not  using every cliche known to man he's ridiculously mixing his metaphors.   And he has taken every overused plot devise he could possibly think of --  AIDS, murder, competition between brothers -- and thrown them all together  as if this were some kind of literary blender.<br />There's nothing I like  more than historical fiction.

US	51355684	R2XPARSLOTEVUM	0312263031	543338950	The Coming Storm	Books	1	9	41	N	N	Skip it at all costs!	I can't remember ever being so outraged by a book.  Once I got through the  mind-numbing, bloated, sludge-like prose (which is the least of the novel's  problems), I found the storyline reprehensible.  For some unknown reason,  the author felt the need to justify the protagonist's pedophilia.  But even  more repugnant, Russell describes the sex scenes between teacher and  underage student in such graphic, salacious detail that it borders on  kiddie porn.  The author tries to make a case that the student was a  willing participant.  But how can a child who is still wetting his bed be  in any position to make an emotional judgement that will affect him for th  rest of his life?<br />The fact that this is a gay novel is irrelevent.   Whether gay or straight, this kind of book is the most repulsive,  irresponsible garbage being printed.  Without debating the issue of  censorship, the publishers have a responsibility not to glamorous such an  insidious issue.  It baffles me how anyone could accept blatant (and  illegal!) sexual titillation and call it art.  And unlike other provocative  artistic statements such as Mapplethorpe's photos, this involves a  defenseless child.<br />Consider yourself warned.	2000-09-06

But try  and look a little below the surface (and this book is all surface) and see  that it's really unbelievable and very shallow.  The characters are so  thinly drawn, that they have only one characteristic each (Gus is  forthright, James is reserved.  And what about Kate?  Was she anything more  than a plot device that popped in and out as needed to forward the story?)   The telling monents, such as Emily grabbing Chris's hand immediately after  she is born is so contrived it's cringe-inducing.<br />I know a lot of pople  will tell me I'm heartless for not being affected by this story.  But when  something is this blatantly manipulative without offering any genuine  insight, I can't fall for it.  But obviously, there are plenty of people  who like to be emotionally manipulated.<br />Is it entertaining?  Yes.  Is it  well written?  Absolutely not.	2000-08-04

Unfortunately, the writer uses a tone that is oddly distancing from the action of the novel -- you never become fully absorbed in the time and  place.

He came out, his friends and  family accepted him and he found the love of his life at 15 years old.  And  while it's lovely that he lived that life, it drains all dramatic pulse  from the beginning of the book.  <br />I'm not totally hard-hearted, the book  is really quite moving.
