This book was wonderful...<br /><br />I laughed.<br /><br />I cried.<br /><br />I was saddened by the ending, as one of my favorite characters died (or so it seems). Will J.K. follow in the footsteps of Tolkien and Lewis, or will she forge a brave new path, with heroes who are laid buried, stay buried?<br /><br />Now - if I can just figure out:<br /><br />Should I be jealous or pleased that I have to wait years for #7 while my grandchildren will be able to read it right away?<br /><br />Take time with your children, J.K.

This is a tough book to review, so I'll highlight the good and bad from my perspective.  Ms. Wallace tells a story that needs to be told, but sometimes the impact of the story was lost in the quagmire of details.<br /><br />Good<br /><br />* I respect the author's courage for writing this book.  It must have been very painful to write.<br /><br />* It's important that more people speak out on the psychological damage that participating in a cult does to people<br /><br />Bad<br /><br />* The book needs a sharper editor.  The backstabbing goes on for about 50 pages too long (either the author has a photographic memory or took excellent notes through the duration of her participation with this group, or she (like Castenada) must have made up a tremendous amount of dialog.<br /><br />* The author's pop psychology analysis of the process grew weary at times.<br /><br />* The author cited the excellent book, \\"The Guru Papers\\", several times, but, based on other things she wrote in the book, seemed to miss the wisdom and insights of much that \\"The Guru Papers\\" offered.<br /><br />I am amazed at people who can read this book and still claim that \\"the jury is still out\\" as to whether or not Castenada told the truth.  What, the guy was completely honest about meeting and training under don juan, and then turns into a sociopathic leader who lied almost constantly?  (...ain't gonna happen...).  This book was very similiar to \\"Enlightenment Blues\\" - another book written by someone who was hurt by a spiritual teacher.  The process and \\"feel\\" of hurtful cults seem to be quite similar.<br /><br />Finally, I would encourage the \\"how-could-she-be-so-stupid\\" reviewers to be a touch more gentle.  Speaking as someone who has been involved with a hurtful, narcissistic teacher - the process evolves slowly, becomes quite hurtful, and it is only in retrospect that I could even question why I put up with the teacher for so long.  There but for the grace of God....	2005-05-29

(I have suggested the book to a number of my clients who have found it quite helpful as well.)<br /><br />Dr. Kepner looks at the PROCESS of treating trauma, something that seems to be left out of the literature in our modern day rush to overprescribe medications and search for quick fixes.  I have found this book and the model he describes in it, to be very helpful as a \\"road map\\" of sorts in my own work.<br /><br />Finally, I have had the great priviledge of being able to study directly with Dr. Kepner.  I find him to be highly intelligent, insightful and passionate about the work that he does.  Dr. Kepner and his colleague Carol DeSanto have been creating an energetic process of working with trauma that they have called \\"Nervous System Energy Work\\".  For anyone interested in subtle energy (such as Reiki), I would invite you to learn more about NSEW at Dr. Kepner's website: [...]	2004-12-30

I dreamed about being a herptologist as a boy, and my children's interests in reading about snakes revived my boyhood curiosity.  I found this book in the library, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  (And personally, I was glad that Mr. Seal was NOT a member of the club....:-)<br /><br />I appreciated Mr. Seal's openness about his fear of snakes (one that I share).  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in snakes.<br /><br />A few random comments:<br /><br />1.  I was thrown off by a few British-isms scattered throughout the book.  (Some sentences didn't make sense to my American ears.  I suppose the same charge could be leveled at American authors.  Still - I would encourage Mr. Seal to be more cautious about the use of slang in future books.)<br /><br />2. Mr. Seal (or the editors) broke up the stories - I imagine in a way that was supposed to build tension in the reader.  While I appreciate that device in some books (mostly fiction), I found it annoying in this one.<br /><br />3.  I found the sections on the fundamentalist snake holders to be fascinating  (that STILL happens in America?!?), but I'd urge the author to be cautious of the conclusions he draws - America is a big country, with many different perspectives.<br /><br />Not wanting to sound nationalistic.  Just a few thoughts I had while I read the book.<br /><br />Again - overall, I enjoyed it, and look forward to other books by the author.  :-)	2004-08-13

Hoping to gain some insight into the behavior of Corporate Exec gone bad, I picked up this book........<br />MISTAKE!<br />This book is the National Enquirer of books.  Ridiculous pop psychology that would make a first-year psych. student howl with laughter (It was the testosterone!  No. Wait.  It was because his mother called him a punk!)<br />The footnote system is insane.  Memo to Mr. Bryon: the use of metaphors (such as Lillith) typically do require footnotes to explain them.<br />Conclusions and assumptions made by others are pushed aside to give more room to Mr. Byron's equally fallacious assumptions and illogical conclusions.<br />Poorly written.  Poorly edited.<br />All this, plus, Mr. Byron sets the men's movement back 20 years with his male-bashing biological reductionism and stereotyping.<br />Too bad.  An insightful book on this topic is sorely needed.  Anyone know of one?	2004-07-20

I would recommend it to others who do holistic counseling or spiritual direction.<br />I found some of Dr. May's logic to be slightly fuzzy.  Part of this is due, no doubt, to the dualism in our language.  However, in describing Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross's perspective, Dr. May attempted to collapse several stages of religious experience into one level.  I would refer any interested reader to the works of Ken Wilber - most notably in this case, &quot;The Atman Project&quot; and &quot;Up from Eden&quot;.<br />Using Wilber's frame of religious experience, Dr. May collapse Sambhogakaya and Dharmakaya together - and 'Teresa and John' (as Dr. May often refers to them) - were clearly in the Dharmakaya level.<br />Using some of Wilber's distinctions would have made this a clearer work<br />I'm looking forward to reading Dr. May's other works.	2004-07-09

I haven't read a trilogy like this in many, many years.  Broad of scope, filled with fantasy and magic, an adult fantasy (in all senses of the word &quot;adult&quot;).  And the eroticism doesn't read (as in some novels) as eroticsm soley for the sake of titilation, but Ms. Carey has blended the eroticism as a solid part of the overall story, just as eroticism is a solid part of human existence.<br />By creating a world that is similar to, but slightly different from the one we inhabit in our waking ours, Ms. Carey offers - inadvertently or no - an interesting commentary on our own culture.<br />Wonderful read!	2004-01-28

I would agree that the first 100 or so pages in this book was a wee bit tedious to get through, but Ms. Carey is laying the foundation for an amazing trilogy, so the reading time is WELL worth it.<br />Ms. Carey's inner world must be phenomenal to give birth to such a story.  And I can only begin to imagine the joys and difficulties that writing such a trilogy would offer the writer.<br />So - on behalf of fantasy lovers everywhere - thank you, Ms. Carey for bringing forth this trilogy	2004-01-28

The day \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" came into our home, it immediately became a volleyball between myself, my wife and my 8 year old son.  Woe betide the person who put this book down to grab a bite to eat or something to drink, because it would be immediately snatched up for avid reading by one of the other two.<br />After several days (and one SERIOUSLY late night of reading), I just finished the book............<br />EXCELLENT!<br />Ms. Rowling's writing is improving with each book (which is to say nothing at all bad about the writing in the first one).  In \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\", I think she has wonderfully captured the rollercoaster of emotions that Harry goes through as an adolescent male.<br />The story is getting more intricate (and darker) and the characters are developed nicely.  I particularly like the attention she gave to deepening both Ron and Hermione (and WHEN are THEY going to kiss?!?  Clearly there seems to be some mutual attraction developing between the two of them. :-)<br />The magic is marvelous and the spells are spectacular.  A slight aside, I continue to be amazed at how Harry continues to struggle with trusting Dumbledore......and withholding information from him.  Dumbledore has saved Harry countless times, so the trust seems well-placed.  Personally, I think it's time to lay this literary device to rest.<br />And yes, one of the characters dies.  A loss to the story line, but (whew!) not one of my favorites......<br />All in all, just a wonderful read.<br />I can't wait for the next volume to come out and I wish \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" was longer.<br />I can't think of any higher praise.<br />Thank you, Ms. Rowling for the sweat and tears that went into this book!<br />Cheers!	2003-06-25

Now, years later, I picked up this book in the library and found out that (GASP!)

He struck me as a truly brilliant and inquisitive person who did not take much at face value, but seemed to question the underpinnings of everything.<br />The highest praise that I can give for this book is that, in reading it, I thought that Mr. Adams must have been an interesting friend, and a fascinating conversationalist (all of which I consider high praise, for what better way to spend an evening that with good friends, intelligent and convivial conversation, and good food?  :-)<br />We lost a great writer when Mr. Adams died.	2002-11-22

I won't review the content of the book, as it has been done repeatedly in the previous reviews.  As I scanned through the reviews, I was struck by how people seemed to either really like this book or really hate it.  I put myself in the former category.<br />Some of the things that I enjoyed about this book were: (1) I enjoyed getting an individual perspective on that period of time in China; (2) I appreciately the writer's willingness to talk about experience in her family of origin; (3) I cannot read, speak or write Chinese, but I enjoyed the writer's use of Chinese phrases (with translation).<br />Several previous reviews have commented on the fact that the author's family wealth basically saved the author from having to suffer abandonment, child prostitution or other similiar horrific fates.  I would like to respectfully point out that, sadly, we will never see the written life experience of those people.  So in many ways, the author's family wealth also supported her in bringing her story to the world.<br />I did struggle with parts of this book (and I'm sure that this is more telling about me than the author :-).<br />I found that the author tended to gloss over her wealth. (Her description early in the book about her family gathering to hear her father's will seemed unneccesarily over the top in the description of the family's wealth.)  While she readily wrote about the deprivations (and their ensuing effect on her), she wrote in (what appeared to me) a rather off-handed manner about the priviledges that she had in being able to study and travel abroad.<br />I also found the author's continued efforts to gain acceptance with her family to be somewhat confusing without having the author share with us her understanding/experience of the process as it unfolded.  I would have been curious to hear more of her internal process around her family process.<br />Overall, I would recommend this book, and I thank the author for being willing to go through what must have been a painful process in order to write her story.been a painful process in order to write her story.	2002-08-22

The author provides concise overviews of the various branches of family therapy, and I found her conclusions and critcisms to be accurate and well-thought out.  I was intrigued by the author's thesis that &quot;the modern family of the West is both patriarchal and father-absent&quot; (p.18).<br />I am familiar with psychoanalytic literature, but I am new to feminist literature.  I thought the author blended both very well.<br />The author states &quot;And if this book made no other additon except to help some therapists contribute a bit less generously to the reproduction of misogyny, it would have succeeded beyond it's author's dreams.&quot; (p.279)<br />This book has changed the way that I approach therapy, so the author can consider herself successful (at least in my case). :-)<br />As excellent as I found this book, there were several reasons why I did not give the book 4 stars.  (However, in the overall scheme of the book, these are minor criticisms, and I would encourage anyone interested to read this book):<br />1. The author generally would build her arguments in a logical, supported way, providing references and citations.  In my opinion, the author builds her arguments as strong as any other author that I've read recently.  However, periodically through the book, the author would make a very strong statement that would seem to come out of the blue, without any supporting statements and/or citations.<br />2.  While I am not admittedly well versed in the object relations school, I do not think the author made a strong enough case for why object relations best suits feminism.  The arguments that she uses could support a similar argument for Jungian analysis, or even Gestalt therapy.  So - why object relations specifically?<br />If anyone knows the author, please express my thanks to her for writing this book.<br />If anyone has any other suggestions for books that I could read on feminist therapy, please e-mail them to me.ggestions for books that I could read on feminist therapy, please e-mail them to me.	2002-08-22

As a psychotherapist and seeker, I found this book to be very important in my own thinking toward Christianity and suffering.<br />For any therapist who works with childhood sexual abuse, Chapter 5 \\"The Unblessed Child\\" alone is worth the price of the book.<br />I would, however, like to address a point raised by a reviewer below, who criticized the book for not answering the questions that it raises.  I think this is unfair criticism. The issues of suffering and violence are vastly complicated, and it is my opinion that by raising the questions and examining them in light of Christianity this book provides a great service.<br />Given the educational levels of the authors, I felt somewhat daunted when I began the book.  To their high credit, the authors have taken complicated, emotionally charged information and have made it very accessible.  I applaud the authors' courage at being willing to step forward and to tell their own stories, and to explore how their own life experiences have impacted their theology.<br />I look forward to hearing more from both of these authors.	2002-05-19

Make a mint julep?  What temperature DO you cook a yam at, anyway?  All this and much more is in this book.  This book has easy to find sections on meats, fish, poultry, drinks, desserts and much more, and many many recipes.  It also has a provides a fairly exhaustive definition of almost anything cooking related from types of crabs to buy all the way to the various types of sugars available on the market.<br />When I'm at a loss for what to serve for dinner, I just flip through this book for ideas.  The same goes for when I am experimenting and creating some new japanese-creole dish to subject my family to!  :-)<br />This is a LARGE book, with no flashy pictures or anything like that (there are some basic drawings - for example, what part of the cow gets cut up for what kind of meat.  Things like that), so you are getting a lot for your money.<br />I would highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys spending any time in the kitchen.  I enjoy it so much that I'm buying another copy as a gift for my little sister's wedding shower!  :-)	2001-07-14

As a therapist who is new to the Gestalt, I have found this text to be a wonderful introduction into the philosophical underpinnings of Gestalt.  Dr. Crocker is a philosopher by training, and she writes with a clear philosopher's hand - using language precisely, defining terms and using metaphor to help the reader understand complex phenomena.  As a trained therapist, she also provides some good clinical case examples to illuminate her discussion.<br />If you like philosophy, and are interested in Gestalt therapy, I would recommend this book.  If you are interested in phenomenology, I would also recommend this book.<br />I believe that this book is one that I will re-read in the future, and each re-reading will help me understand Gestalt at a deeper level.	2001-02-02

I'm not a professional salesperson, so I won't weigh in on the pro's and  con's of the previous reviews.  I found myself in a position where I needed  to do some selling, and a friend recommended this book to me.  I didn't  have time to wade through a huge book with lots and lots of details on  selling.<br />  I would highly recommend this book.  It's an easy read, and  focuses on basics and getting your message across.  As a psychotherapist by  profession, I even found a few suggestions that are helpful for my  practice.  By focusing on basics, Fox avoids the trap of falling into  smoke, mirrors and tricks - which in my experience, both salespeople and  therapists fall into from time to time.<br />Again, I will leave to the  professional salespeople the debate about the merits of this book inside  the field.  However, if you need to know about selling, and don't have a  great deal of time to devote to it, I would suggest that you read this  book.	2000-09-18

I would highly recommend this book to  anyone interested in mythology, psychology, sociology or multi-cultural  studies.<br />When a friend gave me this book, I was a freshman in college -  studying business and intent on a career with computers and technology.  For me, reading this book was like being taken aloft in a airplane - my  head was soon spinning with enormous vistas of thoughts and imaginings of  which I had only dimly been aware.  And at the same time, with almost each  page that I read, a resounding &quot;Yes!&quot; arose from the depths of my  being - confirming in my mind thoughts who's edges I had only brushed up  against.<br />I couldn't put the book down.<br />This book changed the direction  of my life (I ended up graduating in psychology), and the direction of my  thoughts.  I wore out the paperback.  Now, 15 years later, I still return  periodically to the book and re-read it, and find new depths to plumb.

If you lean more toward a romantic  philosophy of life, I would highly recommend this book - especially the  sections on recognizing the invisibles in our lives.  No witch hunt, I  believe that Hillman is trying to go in a completely different direction:  creating respect for those invisibles who support us without falling into  the concreteness of either superstition or empirical science - both of  which render the invisibles invisible.	2000-09-17

After reading it, I can say that the pictures are wonderful, and the text compliments them well.  It is not a heavy-reading book - more of a coffee-table book, but wonderful none the less.  Anyone who has visited an Aikido dojo has probably seen pictures of a serious O'Sensei staring out at them from the shrine. This book has wonderful pictures of O'Sensei late in his life, &quot;at the summit of his career as a spiritual seeker.&quot; as the book describes him.  The pictures showed me a side of O'Sensei's spirit that I hadn't experienced before in other books.  In these pictures, O'Sensei seems to glow, looking at time like a Taoist sage, and at other times like a playful imp (this written with the utmost respect for O'Sensei).  The pictures of him smiling are a delight to see.  I would encourage anyone interested in Aikido to look at this book.	2000-05-17

I have been waiting eagerly for this book since reading Dr. Brooke's previous book (Jung and Phenomenology) several years ago.  And I am absolutely thrilled with the results!  The introduction and the first two  essays alone are worth the price of the book.  I am a very avid reader, and  have been reading a number of Jungian books recently.  Outside of the  classics, Dr. Brooke's current work is the best piece of Jungian literature  that I have read recently. I am also a practicing clinician, and this book  has helped me to deepen my clinical practice and understanding of the  issues I face on a daily basis.  The phenomenological analytical  psychology that Brooke is discussing in his books is, in my opinion,  groundbreaking work that accurately identifies some of Jung's theoretical  shortcomings, as well dreaming Jung's dream onward.  One area of clinical  specialization that I practice is integrating the body and somatic  experiences in psychotherapy.  Dr. Brooke's current book lends itself  extremely well to the support of (dare I say it) holistic work such as  this.  In closing, anyone interested in Jungian psychotherapy and/or theory  would do well to read this book. (And for any Gestalt oriented therapists -  you will also find that this book has a great deal in common with a Gestalt  phenomenological approach)	2000-03-22
