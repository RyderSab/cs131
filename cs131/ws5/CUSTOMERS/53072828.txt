US	53072828	R32NOSDWCS4ZGN	0345284488	632735833	The Devil Wives of Li Fong	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Adventures of the Snake Women	This is a light, enjoyable tale about two snake demons who want to become human.  The story begins when they have achieved human form as a reward for centuries of good works.  In their quest to become fully human women, they meet and marry Li Fong, an apothecary's apprentice.  The household prospers with the help of the snake-women's magic.  Unfortunately, their domestic bliss is threatened by a dishonest Taoist magician and a misguided Buddhist priest . . . .   <BR> <BR>Price seems to have a rather stereotypical view of women that makes it obvious that the book was written in the 1970's (most likely for a male audience), and his characters tend to be somewhat flat.  However, since the snake-women are not &quot;real&quot; women, it isn't too objectionable.  I found myself more than willing to overlook any deficiencies in characterization in favor of the imaginative and entertaining plot.	2004-05-10

It even has nice maps of the commuter train system extending out to the western suburbs, down to Indiana, and up to Wisconsin.  It's also good for orienting yourself before visiting friends in an unfamiliar neighborhood when traveling by public transit. <br />The book's major failing is that it doesn't cover the west and south neighborhoods in the City even though it covers the suburbs of Oak Park and Evanston.  (Nothing in the book is further out than about 3200 west or 63rd street to the south, and it cuts out almost everything found to the southwest of a diagonal line running from the south edge of Logan Square to the west edge of Washington Park.) Maybe the creators of the book thought that the demographic that would be buying the book wouldn't be interested in reading about Beverly or Edison Park.  Nevertheless, I recommend the book.	2004-03-21

For example, the section on bridesmaids has one page per decade, each page with three or four short paragraphs and one illustration.  Other information is rather general: the section on vintage wedding flowers is a list of flowers that were popular from 1910 to 1950, with no breakdown by decade.  Why not include more specific information, such as the fact that when Grace Kelly was married in 1954, she carried a bouquet of lilies of the valley and a small bible?    There are decent suggestions of things to consider when planning a wedding with a period feel (i.e. if you want someone to design a period wedding dress for you, find someone who knows what he or she is doing), but they don't go into more detail than one might expect in a magazine article, assuming one could find an article on the topic.  The glossary is for the most part a pointless waste of space.  For example, it contains definitions like &quot;boot: men's or women's footwear that covers the foot and part of the leg&quot; and &quot;short sleeve: a sleeve length that comes to the middle of the upper arm.&quot;  It does not include definitions of terms like &quot;tarlatan,&quot; which are actually used in the book, such as in the reprinted 1949 directions on how to make a nosegay bouquet.  (In case you are wondering, tarlatan is a kind of open-weave muslin/cotton organdy that has been stiffly starched.)  I have no doubt that someone who needs to have &quot;chiffon&quot; defined (which is included in the glossary) would also need to have tarlatan defined. <br />More potentially useful is the list of historic venues for weddings.  The list is quite scanty (I know for a fact that there is more than one suitable venue in Iowa) but might serve to jog one's memory to think of more in one's own area.  It appears to have better coverage for sites in California.<br />This would be a good book for someone with a general desire to have a wedding with a vintage feel, but who doesn't have a handle on what kind of things were fashionable in different periods.  Someone who already is interested in a given period (particularly if that interest lies in fashion) probably already knows most of what is in the book and probably knows where to look up everything else.  Might be useful as a starting point in the early planning stages.	2004-03-01

Books	5	4	4	N	N	Entertaining	Highly entertaining story for teenagers set in ancient Rome (story begins in 58 BCE), though adults will enjoy it as well-- I just reread it.  Gaius Aemilius Durus is a &quot;pretty man&quot; of the equestrian class, whose dissolute life is spent-- or more accurately, wasted--on all-night drinking bouts and &quot;calling on idle ladies of fashion-preferable married ones of easy virtue.&quot;  Gaius is saved from all that by becoming friends with an older Roman, Tiberius Rufus.  Tiberius and his mother are the embodiment of the traditional Roman virtues.  Tiberius teaches Gaius a number of character-improving things. However, Gaius' father is murdered, the family fortune is lost, and Gaius goes to Gallia to join Julius Caesar's legions.  Fortunately, Tiberius' lessons stand Gaius in good stead, and he has a number of adventures in Gallia and Brittania.<br />I read one of the other book in this series, &quot;With the Eagles&quot; when I was in junior high school-- my father gave me the copy he had as a kid and I loved it.  When I was in my freshman year of high school, I discovered the rest of the series in the library and enjoyed them just as much.<br />For those who are recommending the series only for boys, I want to point out that I'm female (though I had a particular interest in ancient Rome as a kid).  For what it's worth, &quot;Swords in the North,&quot; written in 1935, is a bit more female-friendly than &quot;With the Eagles&quot; which was written in 1929: it actually has some female characters who are more than incidental to the plot.	2003-02-08

As a non-chemist who is certainly not the intended audience of this work, I realize that my opinion about it is of limited value.  However, I found it extremely helpful and interesting.  I'm a bit confused by the &quot;2nd Edition&quot; and &quot;1992&quot; publication date listed above-- as best as I am aware, the second edition of this book was published in three volumes sometime in the 1970's by Wiley-Interscience.  (Needless to say, it is probably a little bit dated.)  Nevertheless, since the authors &amp; title are the same, I feel confident I know what book I am talking about.<br />Because I am merely an interested layperson, I'd hesitate to buy the book at full price-- I was fortunate enough to find a used copy.<br />This book was written for professional cosmetics chemists, and contains information about various toiletry products, from toothpaste to hair dye, from shaving cream to lipstick, from hand lotion to contact lens solution.  Each chapter briefly discusses the history of the cosmetics product in question, and how it is intended to work, and what are considered to be desirable qualities in a product of that kind.  In many cases, formulas for different versions are given.  Each chapter has extensive references at the end, and each volume also includes a glossary of trade names for the various products.  This glossary is helpful if you are also using older &quot;make cosmetics at home&quot; books (as compared with most of the modern book which are all about smearing guacamole all over your body), as many of these list their ingredients by trade name.   <br />A great book to learn more from if you are the kind of person who really enjoyed &quot;Creating Your Own Cosmetics&quot; by Nikolaus Smeh.	2001-06-08

My father and uncle had this book when they were children, and my father gave it to me when I was in junior high school.  It tells the story of a young man whose family was killed by bandits and is left alone in the world.  He joins the Roman Legion, serves under Julius Caesar, and has exciting adventures.  I reread it many, many times.  In the story, virtue (including courage, industriousness, and resourcefulness) is rewarded, which gives it an uplifting message.  I recommend the book highly: not only does it have a good story, but the author had researched the ancient Romans extensively and it goes a wonderful job of presenting history and Roman life in a palatable fashion.  <br />Fortunately, this is but one book of a series!  (The series is called Roman Life and Times, and some of the other books have been reissued-I believe &quot;Swords in the North&quot; is now available in paperback.)	2001-03-08

Fully one-third of the book is devoted to a list of various plant &amp; their extracts used in perfumery and what they smell like to the author.  Some of his spellings for herb  names are archaic. The other two-thirds consists of recipes for potpourri  of various types, with four pages devoted to incense.  All the information  is presented in an anecdotal style, and is very general.  Strangely, though  the author/publisher lives in Glenwood, Illinois, all of the suppliers he  lists but one are far away (New York, California, etc.) even though many  suppliers exist much closer to his home, in Chicago and the surrounding  area. However, there are some useful recipes in the book, and it is as  informative as many more expensive books that devote way to much space to  color pictures that add nothing to the information and serve only to  increase the price of the book.  A good book for the price.

I am very excited, this is a reissue of the 1978 edition which has been unavailable for so long!  The book is a facsimile (with translation) of  &quot;Libro de Geometria,  Pratica Y Traca&quot; (Book of the Practice of Tailoring-- Measuring and  Marking Out) by Juan de Alcega, printed in Madrid in 1589.  Alcega was a  master tailor.<br />The book was apparently intended as a guide for journeymen  tailors, to help them figure out economical ways of cutting out garments,  as well as giving them diagrams for some standard styles of garment.  For  each garment, there is a cutting diagram (much like the cutting diagrams  that come with modern patterns), an estimate as to how much fabric is  required (in Castillian ells) and brief directions on how the garment goes  together.  He also includes charts to help figure out how much fabric is  needed based on desired length of the garment and fabric width. <br />In  &quot;Patterns of Fashion&quot; Janet Arnold cites this book extensively  (the '78 edition), though she complains that the translation is not as  perfect as it could be, because the translators were not costume scholars.  Any Spanish speaking folks doing graduate work in this area?  Here's your  chance.  However, at least after a cursory examination, the translation  seems good enough to me. And Arnold commented that it was extremely useful  even without a perfect translation.<br />The first 4/5 of the book is a  facsimile of the original, the remaining 1/5 is a translation, glossary,  and notes (including a conversion table for Castillian ells to  centimeters).<br />The book contains diagrams for 73 garments, plus a diagram  for a &quot;war banner,&quot; and two diagrams for &quot;silk saddle  trappings for jousts.&quot;  The garments are for both men and women.  The  men's garments include ceremonial cloaks and church vestments.  There are  no diagrams for trousers, because trouser-making was apparently a differentcraft in Alcega's time.	1999-04-25

The characters and situations are just off enough to be funny, but not so much so that this doesn't work as a science  fiction novel.   However, be aware that the first chapter is much more  humourous than the rest of the book.  My only real quibble with this book  is that the primary female character, Y.T., who is allegedly a 15-year old,  acts *nothing* like any real girl of that age would.  I don't have a  problem with her athleticism as a skateboard courier, after all, most  Olympic gymnasts are teenagers.  But, her sexual self-possession cannot be  explained away by the ownership of a device that makes rape impossible.   There is something about the way she acts generally that interfered with my  ability to suspend my disbelief when reading the book.  And I'm not the  kind of person to complain about characterization.  <br />My guess is that  Stephenson was trying to write the female equivalent of the typical  resourceful teenage male character that you find in these types of books,  but just plain didn't know enough teenage girls to know what they are like.   (Note, his later book, &quot;Diamond Age&quot; does a much better job with  the female characters, while in his earlier book, &quot;Zodiac&quot; his  female characters might just as well be cardboard cutouts.)<br />Anyway, read  the book!	1999-04-23

I was very disappointed.<br />It is a decent book, especially  for theater use, but it lacks the excellent understanding of period cut  displayed the 1500-1800 book.  I expected mush more from Hunnisett.<br />There  are many poorly-drawn illustrations which manage to get the point across,  but they do not always show what is really in the paintings they purport to  be redrawn from.  No explanations are given for some of her more unusual  cutting decsions, such as the use of big obvious darts on 15th cent.  bodices.  In other cases, period garments are pictured next to pattern  layouts that could never produce anything resembling them-- almost as bad  as Hill &amp; Bucknell.  None of the example costumes shown in the book are  actually intended as authentic-looking medieval dresses-- all are more or  less fantasy-inspired.<br />If you are looking for a general book on how to  make pseudo-medieval fantasy costumes (that look like tie-dyed nightgowns),  perhaps for children's theater, this is an okay book, but not great--  nothing inspiring here.  If you are looking for a book showing an expert  cutter's conjectures on period cut to use as a starting point for  developing an authentic-looking costume, either for theatrical or  historical reenactment use, don't bother with this one except to check the  one page bibliography in the back, and the single useful one page spread of  15th cent Italian sleeves.  The rest is nothing special at all.  Like so  many of these books, you must take everything she shows you with a big  grain of salt.<br />On the other hand, I cannot recommend &quot;Period Costume  for Stage &amp; Screen, 1500-1800 Vol 1&quot; highly enough.	1998-10-07

However, as a costume reference it is extremely good.  The book is very  well illustrated with pictures of people, and includes many pictures not  shown in &quot;costume books.&quot;  Worthwhile, if you are seriously  interested in the period.	1998-08-27
US	53072828	R2CBFZM2KDIW60	0887346405	865884279	The Art of Arabian Costume: A Saudi Arabian Profile (English and Arabic Edition)	Books	3	15	16	N	N	Lots of color pictures	This book would be a useful resource for middle eastern dancers looking  for costume ideas, but is not as helpful for those looking for exact  information about how the garments are made.  Many of the poses used by the  models are very dramatic (or even high fashion) and attractive, but make it  difficult to make out the details of the garments.  Historical information  is sketchy. However, the wide variety of garments shown and the fact that  they are shown in color, together with the extensive commentary in the  text, makes this a useful book.  There are few books covering Bedouin dress  this extensively.	1998-08-13
US	53072828	R11ERTMZGF6NAU	0963183303	712062129	Chameleon	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Charmingly illustrated story in rhyme.	The story is pleasant to read aloud, and the rhyme makes it easy to memorize.  It describes an adventurous chameleon who changes his colors to match everything from a strawberry milkshake to a zebra. <br /> The pictures are adorable.  My favorite is the one where the chameleon has blended to match a redwood tree-- he has turned bark-colored, is swinging by his tail, and is holding leaves in his mouth and all four feet.  It is really cute!	1998-02-15

You can also get the stuff at [...]  Using the simple directions given in the book you can make shampoos, sunscreens, moisturizers, etc.<br />       Because the book includes extensive discussion of what various cosmetic ingredients are and what they do (both &quot;chemical&quot; and &quot;natural&quot;) it would also make interesting reading for someone who is curious about just what they are putting on their face, and what the possible effects of those ingredients are.  This would make a good companion book to Paula Begoun's book, _Blue Eyeshadow Should Absolutely Be Illegal_.<br />       I haven't tried any of the recipes yet, but I'm going to as soon as I can get the ingredients together.  The recipes appear to be easy to follow.	1997-07-15
