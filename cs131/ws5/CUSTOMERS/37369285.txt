Mr. Badger's Birthday Pie contains many repetitive elements, such as \\"you run in front, I'll run behind\\" and \\"but the fox ran faster\\".  The pattern builds and builds until the greedy fox is tripped up by Great Uncle Ram.  The story is a good one for retelling but I have to say that even I am confused by the ending.  It's supposed to provide a satisfying conclusion, but it really doesn't make sense.  If there were two pies all along, why did Miss Poppy go to such extremes to chase the fox?  And, yes, it's a happy ending but a child that's too young will be surprised that they're all eating pie when we clearly saw it smashed... This book works best for 2-3 year olds.  Anyone older will get hung up on this mysterious second pie, not mentioned until the end.  Where was the other one set to cool?  She is described as making \\"the\\" pie and setting it to cool, not \\"a\\" pie.  So, I guess if you're picky (like me) you could use it in unit about indefinite and definite articles.      By the way, you can also use this book with older children to introduce recipes using plants we now consider weeds.  A good accompanying book, if you'd like to make your own homemade dandelion wine, is The Dandelion Celebration by Peter Gail.	2005-10-13

I agree with the previous reviewer, we just got it out of the library for the cover and didn't expect it to be about slavery.  But I'm glad I got it.  Even though I'm not sharing it with my daughter now, this will definitely be a book for when she gets older.  Sissy's husband-to-be, a free man, walks from far away to their wedding but Sissy's owner refuses to give them a preacher or to do anything to validate the couple.  Undeterred, Ma'am (her mother) gathers every scrap of white fabric she can find and stitches together an all-over dress of white and conducts the ceremony herself.  \\"She decides she'll be the one/To pray them, sing and bless/For she's miracl'd something already/and out of next-to-nothing/Stitched a wedding dress.\\"   They have to take the dress back apart after the ceremony and return all the cloth:  \\"In the kitchen, jelly net spilled through fingers/ I'm the wedding dress, I'm the wedding dress.\\"  When John Bee comes back with enough money to buy Sissy's freedom, her mother and sister have to stay but they know that he will return when he has saved up enough money and one day they all can be together.   <br /> <br />This is a wonderful story, celebrating the strength of family, determination in the face of adversity, and finding joy where you can.  I think it should be a part of every elementary school library and read often, not just in February.	2005-10-13

I never thought twice about the life of a crocodile!  Every page pulls you deeper into a sultry swamp, teeming with life.  The illustrations are rich and deep, but it's the text that really makes this book something special.  You are truly holding your breath as you turn each page, drawn into the magic and mystery of this amazing animal.  I recommend this book to anyone wanting to share the natural world with a young child.  Crocodile is intense, not scary, and beautifully done.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a strong 11.	2005-10-13

I have vowed to make notes on all of the library books we check out each week so that, should I have a book faintly perched on the edge of my mind, I will be able to scan back through my reviews until I find the one I am remembering.  That said, this book has been the naptime request of my 4 year old for several days and she \\"read\\" it to a pillow on the sofa just yesterday.  She especially loves the phrase \\"Where, oh where, is my child?\\"  She got that one dead-on.  This is an excellent book for retelling and could be acted out very successfully in a short dramatic play in kindergarten.  The plot is simple and fun and leads to great discussions about how humans prepare for winter (gathering the harvest, preserving foods by canning them) vs. animals who hibernate (that would be the bear).  This book is, of course, need I say it????  A winner.  You won't be disappointed if you purchase this one.  And little Sal (Sally?  It's a girl) is as cute as a button.  With such wonderful 1940's illustrations, and a warm message, this book is a cozy reminder of days gone by.	2005-10-12

Bo has a very special relationship with his Grandpa -- they don't see each other often, but when they do it's very high quality time.  Playing ball, taking walks, gardening, cooking, listening to records, weaving baskets, carving statues out of a bar of soap... Bo's summer spent with his Grandpa is full of perfect childhood moments.  And Grandpa has just the right attitude towards life.  Every animal and tree is his friend and they give them all names.  Bo's dearest wish is to see a shooting star before the summer ends.  And they do, on the very last night.  The illustrations are warm and perfectly match the tone of the book.  One of Kevin Henkes' earlier books (copyright 1986), you can definitely see him emerging as a strong writing talent.  This is a story to treasure about the love between grandparent and child.	2005-10-12

Books	5	14	16	N	N	an easy new Sunday morning routine	I think a lot of families make pancakes as their special Sunday morning breakfast; we never did until I read this book.  It makes it so easy!  While I was setting up the ingredients my husband read this book to my daughter.  Then we cooked them just like the book said.   <br /> <br />I really recommend the Swedish Pancake Mix by Lund's for this instead of Aunt Jemima since the Swedish mix you have to stir and stir to get all the lumps completely out.  You can even pour it into a jar and shake it to get it smooth, which is a great task for a four year old.  If you have several kids, they can take turns stirring, passing it back and forth forever and you don't have to worry that \\"overmixing will toughen pancakes\\" like with Aunt J.  Even better, you take the Lund's mix and add milk (not water) and an egg which is just like the book... and they make tiny little pancakes which are just kid size.  You only use a tablespoon of batter at a time.  (And jam on pancakes, like in the book, is easier for kids to eat and less messy than syrup... perfect all around, since they'll want to do it like Jack does). <br />   <br />Pancakes Pancakes made a great Sunday morning at our house even better!  And I really like how, if you read it every week, your children will take different things away from it each time, from a small child learning that milk comes from cows/eggs from chickens, to an older child discovering the entire process of threshing wheat.  Eric Carle has written a classic which will grow with your family.  I really recommend making this book a part of your own traditions.	2005-10-03

We have moved three times this year and my 3 1/2 year old daughter, who hasn't sucked her thumb since she turned two, has started it up again.  So I thought perhaps it's a moving-related thing.  I was right!  Not because she has articulated this to me as such, but because she has asked me to read this book 10 times a day since we got it.  It has a calm explanatory tone (no scenes of toddlers throwing fits) which describes why you move, how you move, how you feel, and what the good things are about your new home.  The pictures are wonderful; photographer Jim Judkis follows one family and their little boy from the time they first tell him about the move all the way through the process.  Anyone who's moved can really identify with the photographs.  Tripping over boxes in the kitchen trying to make dinner, friends coming over to help load things into the trunks of their cars, sitting in a new house with bare walls and empty bookcases...  This book has filled the niche perfectly.  It evens talks about how your old house is still there, which is something that had been bothering my daughter and I never would have thought to explain to her.  She's happy now that she knows a new family will be living in it.  I recommend this book highly and am so grateful that I found it when I did.	2005-09-28

It is listed (not this book specifically, but this story) in Beyond the Rainbow Bridge as being an early fairy tale, suitable for 3 and 4 year olds.  It has a good message about the consequences of being greedy.  The only thing which I didn't really understand was when the little girl came back to halt the porridge pot, she yelled \\"Stop, little pot, stop!\\" four times in a row.  I suppose this is because she has to undo the damage her mother caused by using the incorrect magic words four times (halt, enough, no more & cease) but it is a little awkward to read aloud.  This would be a good book to introduce the use of synonyms to an older class as well -- each word in essence means the same thing and yet there are subtle differences between them.	2005-09-28

Brave Martha and the Dragon is based on a Provencal legend and has much more cheerful illustrations (collages of cut paper and fabric) as well as a happier overall tone.  The dialogue is humorous and it's a fun book to read aloud.  Of course, Martha tames the dragon, which is the basis of a celebratory festival in the French town of Tarascon each year.  This would therefore be a good book to read when studying either French culture or dragon legends from around the world.  Some of the collages are a little sloppy or confusing which is what prevents me from giving it 5 stars but this a good not-too-scary dragon book which even a young child would enjoy.	2005-09-28

Set up as a simple chapter book, the tale is, in fact, complex and drives the action forward through the use of amazing drawings by Stephen Gammell.  In the early morning mist, a young boy is drawn to a lake from where, as he has heard from the elders in his tribe, the buffaloes are supposed to come.  He indeed sees them rising from the mist and is inspired to cry out to them.  They are entranced by him and suddenly move forward, all in a mass; he struggles to leap on his pony and run ahead of their advance but they thunder down upon him until he is running in the midst of their herd.  A band of rival Indians, having been about to attack his people, cannot escape the massive buffaloes and so the tale becomes one of legend and the boy is always remembered for saving his people.  It's an amazing story and I cannot wait to share it with my children as they learn about the Plains and the Plains Indians.	2005-09-28

Yesterday we took a Nature walk and my daughter found a white feather lying on the ground.  When we got home and put it on our Nature table, I remembered that I had this book and we read it together; it turned out to be the perfect complement.  Grandmother Winter collects feathers all throughout the Spring and Summer from her flock of geese.  In Autumn, she stitches together a quilt and stuffs it with the soft feathers.  The arrival of the first snow means that Grandmother Winter has shaken her quilt over the world from high in the sky and then she goes to sleep and rests through the Winter.  Many other animals also take shelter for the Winter -- this book talks about frogs, fish, bears, earthworms, butterflies and many other animals (including, of course, Grandmother Winter's geese) and how they make it through the Winter.  This book is a perfect blend of storytelling and natural history and I would recommend it to any family watching the seasons change.	2005-09-28

The artwork made it seem like it would be something new and different (from the cover page:  \\"The full-color artwork was prepared with charcoal, pastel, and colored pencils.  It was then scanner-separated and reproduced in red, blue, yellow, and black halftones.\\") -- but the story itself is like a pale shadow of Little House on the Prairie.  How they packed, camped, slept outside, forded a river... the part where Pa drove away every day down to the river and cut down trees to bring back and use for the logs to build their new home... it's all exactly the same.  Winter came and the snow was so deep that Pa tied a rope between the house and barn and held onto it to go back and forth and do his chores... and so on and so forth.  I disagree with the review below that the author didn't do any homework; but it looks to me like he/she only read ONE book -- and I'd rather read the original!  Skip this book and get the real thing.  Laura Ingalls Wilder did a better job.	2005-09-28

I'm glad the other reviews here are all 5 stars -- I definitely agree -- but they aren't very compelling.  I think this book is a must-read for any child interested in fantasy.  And I'll give away part of the plot, in hopes of convincing you.  Two dragons from Wales decide (who knows why; dragons aren't usually curious) to travel to America and see some of the sites they have heard tourists mention.  While there, they are seen and attacked by some humans and are forced to leave their unhatched egg behind when they escape.  100 years later the egg hatches and a new dragon (Orm) is sent from Wales, given the task of retrieving the hatchling as stealthfully as possible and without loss of human life.   <br /> <br />From the human standpoint, a wonderful mystical object was discovered on the shores of a lake and the family has cherished and passed this unusual possession down through the generations.  Henry Berg is the one who is there when it hatches and his mom (typical distant parent-teenager relationship) refuses to believe his story.  He then comes up with a lie which is that he bought a new lizard at the pet store; she allows him to keep the baby dragon who he names Vincent.  No one knows what kind of animal Vincent truly is.  When the adult dragon shows up to retrieve the baby, all kinds of trouble starts... <br /> <br />The story has a good plot about respect for creatures other than ourselves and I love the ending where they (Henry and Millie, an adult friend who gets pulled into the fray) figure out a way to return the baby to the mountain of Wales where he belongs.	2005-09-25

I sure do.  Rainbow Bird tells an aboriginal folktale from northern Australia which explains that, long ago, fire was the exclusive domain of one animal:  Crocodile.  He held fire in his mouth and refused to share it with any one.  Men and animals were cold and had to eat their food raw; they begged him for fire but Crocodile didn't care.  He was greedy and selfish and didn't want to share.  One day he accidentally yawned so wide that Rainbow Bird was able to quickly dart down and take the fire from his maw.  She had always felt it should be shared by everyone so she quickly put fire \\"in the heart of every tree\\".  Crocodile is still to this day opening and closing his jaws in frustration.  I think this is a beautiful story and my daughter and I enjoyed both the tale and the wonderful illustrations.  I would recommend this book as the perfect read for a snuggle by a campfire and to take an opportunity to be thankful for all we have been given by nature.	2005-09-08

I believe she is even replacing Eric Carle (whose work has begun to feel more sporadic in quality).  The Lion and the Little Red Bird would be a wonderful book to introduce a unit on painting if you're  an art teacher.  Depending on the age of the children, you can go into the history of cave painting, the use of ocher, making paints and stains with berries and other natural materials, etc.  You could talk about how brushes are constructed and what materials they have been made of throughout history.  What is it that makes us decorate the walls of their homes?  Is it the necessity of recording culture and historical events?  An urge to be creative which runs as a common thread throughout humanity?  One's personal need to believe you have created something which will exist after you have left this earth, to make your mark?   <br /> <br />Or, you can read it with a preschooler with the goal of celebrating the triumphs of friendship and the joy we all feel when creating something we can call our very own!	2005-09-08

The Paper Princess goes extremely well with another favorite book - Soul Mate Dolls.  If you have a daughter who will immediately want to make a paper doll after you've finished reading The Paper Princess, get Soul Mate Dolls as well.  This story is so good I feel a strong urge to buy every one of Elisa Kleven's other books, sight unseen (I might, in fact, since we also checked out The Lion and the Little Red Bird in the same week and that one is extraordinary as well).

I picked it out from the library since I was looking for stories about owls but this tale turns out to be more a story about minding your own business.  I read it to my daughter a few times on days when she had been getting in trouble for being nosy; I thought it would be a gentle humourous story that lets her know that everyone is nosy sometimes,  so it's not just her being singled out.  Of course, the story also sends the message that you don't want to take your interrupting and rudeness too far!  She was almost 4 at the time and always got very serious and sober after the story.  After the third time, she asked me not to read it anymore.  I suppose this is because she felt it was speaking directly to her and it made her uncomfortable.  I personally thought the book was humorous and beautifully illustrated.  It would make a nice addition to a unit on Native American studies for older children.	2005-09-08

I'm somewhat ashamed to say that I had never had the courage to bake yeast bread before this book, even knowing that it's supposed to be a wonderful, almost spiritual, soul-enriching experience... This book changed my mind and gave me the confidence to proceed beyond zucchini bread and muffins.  Uncle Jon's faith in the pleasures of baking one more loaf - even though, as his wife points out, their kitchen is filled to the brim with baked goods and there's no one around to eat any of them - as well as the marvelous rich lifelike illustrations, got me straight into the kitchen.  Baking bread is worth it all on its own; the question of whether there's anyone around to eat is strictly a moot point.  And lo and behold, as the story goes on, the enticing smell of the baking bread does wake up people and animals who come sleepily wandering into Uncle Jon's kitchen from all around the countryside.  My daughter and I hummed and sang as we kneaded and waiting, punched down and braided, and (of course) ate our delicous bread.  This is a wonderful addition to any family's library.	2005-09-08

This is a collage which is then inked and printed on an etching press, and the resulting print is then colored once again to emphasize details.  The illustrations add richness to the simple yet profound topic.  According to the author, she was visiting France when a little girl asked her:  do you have a moon in America?  is it the same moon we have here?  I always love books which help children explore questions we adults have already forgotten to ask.  The text is lyrical and creates beautiful imaginative pictures of different regions, animals, and lifestyles around the world.  My only small quibble with the book is that, towards the end, it states that once each month, on a special night, there is a full moon which can be seen all around the world by everyone.  This nearly undermines the entire book by making it seem as though the moon can ONLY be seen by everyone around the world when it is full; however, I think the overall quality of the book still makes it a must-own.	2005-09-08

In The Hat, a small hedgehog accidentally gets tangled up in some winter woolens which are hung to air out.  Each animal he meets laughs at him but, upon hearing Hedgie's clever replies, becomes convinced that he too needs a \\"hat\\".  On the left sidebar we see the movements of the little girl, completely unaware of what is happening to her clothing outside.  On the top we see the line of laundry, first full... then slowly more and more pieces of clothing begin to disappear.  The foreshadowing continues with the right sidebar, first showing each animal who is about to approach Hedgie, then towards the end of the story we can see each animal struggling to get into the piece of clothing they have taken off the line.  My daughter loved this book and caught on to the joke right away - I think this is the first time she's noticed that the illustrations contain more information than just what the text directly states - and gleefully shouted \\"clothes aren't for animals!\\" as it became more and more apparent what direction the story was heading in.  I think this book is better than The Mitten; we enjoyed it very much.	2005-08-20

Step by step, with one chapter devoted to each part of the maple syrup-making process, the black and white photography and clear text leads you through a wintery world of magic.  I sat down and read this book cover to cover and then immediately read it all over again, not wanting to leave the peaceful world of the sugarbush (a grove of maple trees).  The crisp and snowy wonderland setting does not mean that sugaring is easy, however; it is intensely hard work spread out over a four week time period.  Maple syrup is harvested in March, in that break between coldest winter and earliest spring, when the days are above freezing and brightly lit but the nights are still cold.  The direct, strengthening light of the sun warming the trees after the vernal equinox gets their sap flowing and it is from this sap that the syrup is made.  That part I knew but everything else about this book revealed a world that was new to me, from the exact temperature sap becomes syrup and what happens if you hit too high or too low, how long the sap will last before it spoils, how the syrup is tested, the precise density it must be to store properly, even how old you have to be before your parents let you Really Help (which is, of course, the part most interesting to small children).  This is a world where everyone travels by ski or by sled, which is amazing to me; I can't imagine that depth of winter.  The text is as warm and delicious as maple syrup itself:  \\"The sparkling sap, clear and bright, runs like streams of Christmas tinsle.  They each take a lick and wonder how so much crystal sweetness can come from a gnarled tree older than all their grandparents put together.\\"  Close-up pictures of all steps of the process as well as the exact equipment used makes this book as informative as it is enjoyable.

The illustrations are lively and charming; the tale is retold simply and well.  This book also does an excellent job of conveying what a cobbler does, if you are looking for some books to bring history alive.  Not many children now think twice about where their shoes come from.  Above all else, the illustrations really bring the tale alive.  The quality of the expressions on each character's face is truly incredible and any small child can easily \\"read\\" along by seeing the delight on the faces of the customers, the patience and careful work done by the elves (you can practically hear them whistle as they work), the astonishment and gratitude felt by the shoemaker and his wife.  This heartwarming story is a must for any preschool or first grade classroom.	2005-08-20

The illustrations are suberb, the concept is lovely and, as it says in the author biography in the back, Janell Cannon was a librarian who developed quality summer reading programs specifically to educate about animals and alleviate myths about those often disparaged.  If you are doing a unit on fruit bats, certainly, Stellaluna would be a wise choice.  For the rest of us, however, I have to say that the text is quite thin and I, myself, like books about friendship which are a bit more subtle (see my review of The Rusty, Trusty Tractor for an example) and don't knock me over the head with a cudgel declaring \\"But we're friends.  And that's a fact.\\"  I do like the illustrations quite a bit which consist of one full color full-page on the right and one smaller pen and ink above the lefthand page of text.  The smaller illustration shows Stellaluna's mother diligently searching for her baby as the story travels onward, which I think is sweet.  Overall, though, I think this book got most of its press for being about bats and less for the writing itself.  When my daughter tore up our library's copy my heart sank and I thought, oh, no, this isn't a book I want to buy!!!  They didn't make me buy it but that feeling still remains.  I liked Verdi a lot more; check out some of Janell Cannon's later books for more tales which spotlight little-known animals in a kind and perceptive way.	2005-08-20

The Fortune-tellers is a story of an old fraud whose prophesies for every customer are identical and very tongue-in-cheek.  For example, the young man who comes to hear his fortune is told that he will become rich provided he can earn a lot of money, live a long life assuming it is not cut short by an early demise, and will marry his true love on the condition that he meets her, proposes to her, and she accepts him.  The young carpenter is overjoyed by the good news of his future and runs back with more questions; however, he finds the room empty and when others come in, they assume that he is the fortune-teller transformed into a younger body.  As the carpenter had been wishing for another trade, he takes the place of the old man, giving out the same advice which had been given to him.  When this advice proves very popular he, in fact, achieves the wealth, happiness, and long life which had been \\"foretold\\" and often thinks fondly of the man who had seen the future so clearly.  We learn of the fate of the real fortune-teller as well, who fell out of a window and spent the remainder of his life plagued by troubles.  The humour in this story is great and will be enjoyed the most by older elementary or middle-school children who \\"get\\" the jokes.   <br /> <br /> <br /> I can't finish this review without commenting on the wonderful illustrations.  The Caldecott medal-winning illustrator, Trina Schart Hyman, based them on her travels to Cameroon and they are truly exquisite.  Rich and full of detail, each page is tapestry of colors and textures.  This story is a perfect teaching tool and is a window for children onto the beauty of Africa and the bountiful humor and wisdom of its people.  An entire unit could be developed from identifying and learning more about the foods, household items, clothing and fabrics, buildings, professions, landscape and animals shown in the amazing paintings found in this book.  Even if you aren't able to develop such a unit, this book is an excellent choice to build interest and begin a discussion about West Africa.	2005-08-20

As Micah gets caught up in the world of new shiny tractors at the showroom, he too starts to hint that perhaps they should replace their old one.  But Granpappy stands firm, saying \\"this is my old friend, and friends don't let each other down.  You remember that.\\"  Throughout the plowing, planting, mowing, and baling of the hay, Micah watches Granpappy treat his fifty-year old tractor with kindness and respect, talking to it and whistling songs and - even though \\"plain and simple, no way is that tractor going to tow a hay baler\\" - the old tractor comes through.  The enduring children's book theme of the power of friendship here receives a new unexpected treatment and the results are outstanding.  The farm equipment theme immediately got my daughter more interested in farming and she began to ask questions too about construction equipment.  This book is a wonderful, warm addition to any child's library with uses in any unit about friendship, the seasons, or farming.	2005-08-20
US	37369285	R1A31WOJTHX33B	B0007XWMUG	609560296	Verdi	Books	4	1	1	N	N	the search for eternal youth	This book would make a wonderful tongue-in-cheek gift for your friends who are trying to outrun time by dyeing away those gray hairs.  Verdi knows that he will lose his brilliant yellow skin and turn green as the forest when he gets older and, being a typical young know-it-all, declares that he won't let it happen.  Of course, age creeps up on all of us and Verdi finds that he has become a large green snake after all, content to lie on a branch and observe the world as it passes.  I like Verdi as a character very much; we cheer him on through the story in his quest for eternal youth and we enjoy his calm acceptance when he does relax and let his body change as it will.  The only reason I'm giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because of some of the language; I don't like how the younger snakes are rude to the older ones.  Verdi stares, fidgits, and interrupts his elders and so do the young snakes we meet at the end of the book who are belittling him - \\"Get a load of that old green guy,\\" one of them whispered.  \\"Do you think he ever moves?\\"  The other snickered.  \\"I seriously doubt it.\\"  I don't really appreciate this atmosphere of disrespect filtering into my home but I think the rest of the book is good enough that I intend to continue to check the book out from our library.  I don't know if I would buy a copy, though.  I do think that this story has potential in first grade to go along with an introduction to Form Drawing - Verdi, in his younger days, has a penchant for leaping from trees and forming shapes in the air such as a spiral and a figure eight.	2005-08-20

This is another book (like Fledgling, previously reviewed) which isn't obviously charming when glanced through but comes into its own in the read-aloud.  It gained a lot of attention for its illustrations but I think the story line is even better.  The simple text is charming and perfect.  You can't help but hold your breath as you follow along with Kitten's ups and downs, trying valiantly to reach that \\"little bowl of milk, just waiting\\" in the sky.  And, of course, the happy ending with its fairy tale quality... who can help but believe that those who truly deserve it find their happiness in good time.  Buy this book for the science of it (full moon, reflections) or for the fun of it, but don't hold back.   I give it a million gold stars.	2005-08-11

It is a tale of a small lion prince who was born with wings but never taught how to use them.  One day he accidentally catches the wind blowing through his room and sails out the window, crash landing in the territory of the rival king.  This king is kind to him and helps tend his broken wing, while teaching the little prince to read.  When the prince returns home, he shares his newfound treasure with his friends as no one in his kingdom had previously known of the existence of books.  It's a nice story to introduce the idea of learning to read to your child, since it emphasizes that being able to read is a real gift, but I thought the text was a bit simple and the illustrations didn't always follow the pacing of the story.  Overall, you might want to borrow this from the library but it's not a must-own.	2005-08-11

Books	4	2	3	N	N	Sly fox loses again	The perennial story of a sly fox trying to trick other, more innocent animals is given a new chapter here.  In this story, the fox attempts to persuade mother duck that he is a duck as well, so that he can sneak up on her ducklings and have one for lunch.  Mother duck asks the visitor to prove himself by quacking, waddling, eating bugs for lunch, and - finally - diving headfirst deep into the pond, whereupon the fox decides it's not worth all the trouble and heads for home.  Children who don't know that foxes eat ducklings might find the story to be a bit over their heads.  I think my daughter, who is 3, was too young to really enjoy it.  This book would be perfect for a second grade classroom studying animal tales and Aesop's fables.	2005-08-11

This is the story of Hope, whose grandfather recently passed away.  She doesn't want to attend the funeral because she doesn't want to be reminded that she'll never see him again.  Her aunt Poogee talks with her and asks Hope to remember a good time she spent with her grandfather, saying that she will be able to see him again in her mind's eye.  As Hope remembers the day they went blackberry picking, she is reassured that her grandpa is not lost forever - whenever she thinks of him, hears family stories, or makes the blackberry stew that he loved so much, he will be there with her.  This is a very sensitive child-appropriate book about losing a family member that isn't preachy or too obvious.  The majority of the story details the day spent picking blackberries and their surprise encounter with a snake (I love how grandpa tells Hope that the snake is nothing to be afraid of and that he is their friend, keeping mice away from the house, and encourages her to touch him).  My daughter asked for this book over and over again.  It would be a good one to have in your repertoire if your child is, or may shortly be, dealing with death.	2005-08-11

The illustrations are breath-taking and the tale is sweet and tender.  Joshie Otter ventures off by himself looking to play but finding no one among the various animals of the Aleutian Islands who is interested.  Suddenly he realizes that he has swum too far from home and doesn't know how to get back.  Over the waves he hears his mother's voice singing to him and, guided by her song, he finds his way home.  The words and music for the song are included at the end of the book.  This is a sweet bedtime book for any baby and would be an especially wonderful gift for a little boy named Josh.	2005-08-11

I save the really juicy task of reading the books cover to cover for when I get home.  This book, both during the flip-through and the first reading alone, didn't really appeal -- but I found when I went to share it with my daughter that in reading aloud this story comes alive!  There are only a few words on each page but, since the text is the thoughts inside Fledgling's head as she ventures out into the city on her own, flying for the first time, you really feel that you are taking the flight alongside her.  The urban scenery is detailed and realistic although my daughter, never having been on the subway, missed most of the action when the inhabitants of the subway car frantically try to shoo away the confused and frightened bird.  The story also has a reassuring message; when Fledgling realizes she doesn't know where home is, she hears the sound of her family calling her and returns safely.  This is a fantastic book for any nature lover, or to teach your child about some of the wildlife that has made our cities their home.	2005-08-11

The illustrations are wonderful, all silhouettes of the action against an ever-changing sky from daylight to dusk.  I wasn't entirely prepared for the story which is a bit odd but sure to become a classic.  Remember Harold and the Purple Crayon?  Where the Wild Things Are?  This book falls in the same category.

Jane Dyer, a favorite illustrator, doesn't disappoint.  In each illustration, an animal mother is tucking her baby into bed with a simple rhyme.  The close-up of the bee is a favorite; I also like how some other unusual animals are included such as snake and fish.  My only quibble with the text is that sometimes it's \\"little sheep\\" or \\"little deer\\" and sometimes it's \\"little calf\\" or \\"little foal\\".  Switching back and forth from the proper name of the baby animal makes it hard for an older child, who knows her animals, to try to read along.  For the illustrations alone, get this book.  And I would love someone to put out a series of these illustrations framed for use in the nursery.  They are truly marvelous.	2005-08-11

I can't wait to give this book to them as a gift along with a set of child's gardening tools.  This book is a heartwarming tale for any child to read, however, so don't hesitate to ask your librarian for this one.  The book carries a young child along with the cycle of planting and growing things in the garden.  Every part of the cycle is the time for something, \\"digging time\\", \\"thinking time\\", \\"planting time\\", \\"weeding time\\", \\"resting time\\", etc. and this message is an especially good one for a child beginning to absorb the unhealthy concept of instant gratification - teach your children that everything happens in its own good time and to enjoy ALL parts of the cycle.  In terms of gift giving, this is a good book for the winter holidays since it shows that the cycle of growing begins in the winter, not in the spring, as the earth rests and renews itself in preparation. The illustrations are joyous although they might be a little to loosely painted for some; we all have our own tastes in this regard.  I loved this book and can't wait to read it each winter to remind my daughter of all the riches hiding in the earth down under the snow, waiting, waiting to be set free in the springtime...	2005-08-11

This story dates from the 1950's and is a simple tale of all the things that are wonderful about trees.  I could start quoting it but I'd quickly have the whole text in here which is probably illegal.  Suffice it to say that any elementary school classroom which does not have this book is lacking.  The entire list of what we use trees for: play forts, sticks to dig in the dirt with, houses for birds, escape route for cats, shade from the hot sun, windblocks for our homes... I'm surprised the Arbor Day Foundation doesn't give this book away for free instead of a dozen trees which are sure to die - it would certainly do better to promote its cause that way.  The book ends with describing how to plant a tree of your own, as well as the pride you feel in watching it grow for years and telling everyone you know that \\"I planted that tree\\"; then \\"They wish they had one so they go home and plant a tree too.\\"  Okay, so I couldn't refrain from quoting it a little after all!  This book demonstrates a real respect for nature and, by the way, it also won the Caldecott Medal.  Of all the library books we got out this week, this is my must-buy and I'm going to place my Amazon order for it right now.	2005-08-11

But as I read further along, I found additional tales translated from Danish, French, Swedish, German, and Japanese.  I have definitely found some new favorites with this collection, especially in the few Japanese stories.  Uraschimataro and the Turtle is wonderful.  I also loved Peter Bull!  I wish there were more Japanese stories but, as this is the first volume of this collection I have read, I am hopeful to find more in another one of the series.  Depending on your existing collection of fairy tales, this may not be a must-own but it is certainly a must-read.	2005-08-03

Patricia Polacco is an extremely talented author but I don't completely understand where she was coming from with this one.  The classic story of the Fisherman and His Wife here receives a new treatment where Luba, previously \\"full of joy and free from care as all children should be\\", saves the life of a little enchanted wren and is pressured by her parents to request more and more gifts in return.  In the traditional story the fish, tired of granting wishes to the never-satisfied wife, states that the couple will get what they deserve and it turns out to be their original house.  This story has a slightly different ending where the parents ask to be \\"as Gods\\" and the wren grants their wish saying to Luba, \\"Go then, my child... it is already done\\".  She returns to find them with their original humble dwelling and station in life returned to them, yet content with their lot, as they embrace their daughter warmly.  I'm not sure how the parents being happy at last (although it's a nice touch) constitutes their wish being granted.  Overall I'd say to stick with the original when you choose to share this story with your children.	2005-08-03

When I read it again to my daughter, I turned to the page where \\"Alas, that very day, the King of the elephants had eaten a bad mushroom\\" and thought wow, I remember that!  The resurging memory of that illustration is so keen in my mind, it's as if twenty-plus years had just fallen away.  And next comes my very favorite line, for its old-fashioned text and neatness of phrase:  \\"It poisoned him and he became ill, so ill that he died.  This was a great calamity.\\"  Which is not to say that the story of Babar dwells on sad things, because it doesn't.  Whatever happens to Babar he deals with it with grace and moves on.  Endlessly adaptable, this is an elephant who so charms the ladies that he woos and wins Celeste in just their brief drive home.  The only sticking point for some parents who are encountering this book for the first time and therefore don't have their eyes all misting over with tender rememberances of their own childhood is that Babar is chosen to be the new king of the elephants because he is considered to have \\"learned so much living among men\\".  If you are trying not to teach your children that humans are above and beyond all other animals, you may not want this subtle message.  Overall, I think this book is wonderful and, at the end, when he and Celeste fly away in a hot air balloon to begin their honeymoon, it is clear that the story continues.  This can be taken in the vein of allowing for endless opportunity of sequels but I prefer to think of it as the beginning of your child's opportunity to answer \\"what happens next\\" and regale you with their own series of stories about the adventures of Babar, the little elephant.	2005-08-03

A recipe for both baked and steamed nian-gao is included at the end.  In the reading aloud, this book has a subtle message about sharing and compassion although I think the text gets a little irritating when, over and over, \\"something incredible happened\\".  Just as a description is not made more so by the endless use of \\"very\\", an event is not made more incredible when it is announced in advance that it will be incredible... and, in fact, it detracts a bit from the magic.  I think the text could be a bit more sophisticated but, overall, this is still a wonderful story to share.	2005-08-03

I would use it with older children -- elementary age -- to discuss the life cycle of an annual, the role of the seasons, and the challenges of reproduction which must be overcome by all plants.  The Tiny Seed introduces us to many of the hazards faced by seeds and seedlings as they attempt to grow (from falling in water and drowning, being eaten by birds or mice, being overshadowed by large weeds, being stepped on by children, and more) and shows how the ideal environment is a necessity.  It covers the role of sunshine and rain, how the seed swells and bursts open, how the plant develops as it grows, and how it produces and disperses its seeds to carry on the next generation.  It's not a book for small children, though, since its mostly non-fiction tone is dry, the phrases are stilted, and it doesn't read aloud well.  I find it difficult to \\"cheer on\\" the tiny seed; where others see him as a hero facing difficult odds, I think the book is too grimly determined to be educational and becomes boring for the youngest child.  If you want a book to introduce a unit on seed dispersal, this is the one.  If you want to talk with your three year old about the cycle of the seasons, you'd be better off with the Spring/Summer/Autumn/Winter collection by Gerda Muller.	2005-07-24

Cut paper collage illustrations depict a variety of animals and the way they move.  There is just one word on each page.  For a few movements, most of which the child can act out as you read, more than one animal is shown.  I especially like the illustration for \\"burrow\\" which shows a fox, family of rabbits, badger, mice, worms and other animals all living underground.  Another favorite is \\"cling\\" with mommy and baby koalas; this is nice to act out with your child.  The illustration for \\"waddle\\" is a group of penguins so we will read this again after watching March of the Penguins, if it ever comes to a theater near us.  If not, I'll still be happy we got this book as it made a short and sweet transition to naptime.	2005-07-24

This one followed in 1991.  After reading it, I have the strong feeling that Eric Carle was pressured to do a companion volume and hastily threw this out onto the market.  The composition of the artwork is not nearly as strong as his other works; in fact, I would go so far as to say that this is his worst book.  The selection of poetry is meager and nearly all of the poems are dismissive of the creatures as silly or non-existent.  The subtitle of the book is \\"& other creatures which never were\\" which put my hackles up right from the start.  I don't think any of us have been around for long enough to judge what is \\"real\\".  Perhaps this is my Philosophy major talking.  Anyway, that coupled with the intro which is William Blake, \\"O!  how I dreamt of things impossible\\" and the conclusion page which is a quote from A Midsummer Night's Dream regarding the \\"weak and idle theme\\"... I cannot think of a more dismissive characterization of the rich legends held by many cultures around the world.  I was actually offended by this book and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.	2005-07-24

It can be used by teachers and homeschooling families to discuss the different sections of the rain forest canopy and the animals which inhabit it, camouflage (the jaguar), erosion and other effects of deforestation, the native peoples of the rain forest, the role of trees in producing oxygen, the concept of habitat, the concept of pollination, predators and prey, and the idea that our actions have an impact on all generations which succeed us.  This can be tied in to a study of restructuring urban development to avoid sprawl, or the political debate over economic growth versus preservation of natural resources.  New research is coming out about potentially valuable medications that can be made from engangered species which inhabit the rain forest; have your child analyze what might be gained versus what might be lost if we destroy this habitat.  Discuss the depletion of the ozone layer.  Although we don't know whether the tree was to be cut down to make way for development, to be used as lumber, or to make paper products, you can use this book to introduce the very real impact of recycling.  Purchase some Seventh Generation paper products and read the quote from The Great Law of The Iroquois Confederacy:   <br /> <br />\\"In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations.\\"   <br /> <br />The story of The Great Kapok Tree can be tied in with a social studies or science curriculum at nearly every grade level.

It would be a nice addition to a collection of books about Turkish culture, especially for the time period in which he lived; however, I found it a little heavy-handed in the morals department.  The tale is humorous and makes its point well but Demi pushes the text to reinforce the point over and over until it makes your head swim, \\"If you want to look deeply, look at the man and not as his coat.  You can change the coat, but you cannot change the man.  A coat may be fine, but a coat does not make a man.  Outside a man may wear a sheepskin, but inside he may wear the heart of a wolf!  Many a good man may be found under a shabby coat.  With coats, new are the best.  But with friends, old are the best!\\"  The illustrations are nice but not as magical as I have found in her other books.  Keep this one on the shelf under Turkish Culture or in a collection of Fables, Parables, and Other Moral Tales.	2005-07-24

The story begins with \\"Shhh, listen --\\" and the illustration of the girl stretched out with her ear pressed down to the floor listening to the train approach is so accurate, it pulls you straight in to her world.  It's easy for any young person to feel that she is there right alongside the girl in the book.  The author conveys the sights and sounds of a train ride so well that I am always transported back to my own train journeys, even though I myself have never been stuck on the tracks in the middle of a blizzard (the events of the book are based on a true story).  The details and imagery are vivid and perfect and the actions of the young girl riding alone so wonderfully recall what any of us would do at that age -- marvel at the astonishingly perfect shape of sugar cubes, wave at the cows as we pass, press our nose to the glass and watch the snow magically soften and whiten the world, slide off the seat and bump-tumble to the floor when the train suddenly stops...  This book is wonderful to share with any young child and will increase their appreciation for trains, for travel, and for the up and down feelings that come when doing something new as well as the ultimate joy and triumph of achieving something on your own.  An enthusiastic 5 stars.	2005-07-24

He thought I was being a little silly, reading him a picture book, but ended up really getting into it and laughing out loud at the climax.  This book does contain \\"broad humor\\" so, although you could read it to a younger child, they wouldn't catch on to many of the subtleties.  The message that you shouldn't be rude to people still comes through.  I believe that taking fairy tales out of our modern curriculum has had the unintended effect of eliminating the teaching of values.  The way your face widens to a smile when the simple country lad teaches the pompous king a richly deserved lesson is an indication that the resolution is satisfying and pleasing even to an adult.  It just makes you feel good, like all is right with the world, and the message is universal - you get what you deserve.  This book is an excellent addition to any elementary or middle school classroom, as well as your own home.  Don't let your family miss this one!	2005-07-24

I snuck The Egg and I off for our weekend at the beach cabin, thinking I was up for a delightful Life Among the Savages (Shirley Jackson) type book.  No.  Not even close.  This woman comes off as being so snobby, racist (the nasty comments against Native Americans will make you cringe), and whiny, I'm stunned that it is the same brilliant author who gave us Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle.  This book isn't a light-hearted treatment of adjusting to rural life on a chicken farm.  It is an unending stream of complaints.  I don't even get the feeling that she likes her husband and, as a tale of the early years of matrimony, hearing her complain that he looks at her shoulders more for the burden they can bear than for the sake of admiring the shoulders themselves, I think she deserved every vomiting puppy she got.	2005-06-29

I started with, remember that book with the girl who was orphaned so she could only wear grey and lavender? (yes, Victorian era all the way)  And there was a little seashore and all the boats had black sails?  And Robin lived underground and his mother didn't have a mirror, just a round piece of copper?  The images in this book are so striking, they will stay with you 20+ years after reading.  Yes, the archetypes are there, but they aren't anything to be afraid of.  Masterfully written, this is a book to be devoured in one sitting.  The Little White Horse pulls you deep into its world -- and it's a fantasy world you want to be in (unlike Lemony Snicket, I might add).  This is my favorite Elizabeth Gouge book and I would recommend it to any young girl, especially preteen or early teen.  I rate it *Simply Delicious* and A Classic, definitely worth sharing with the next generation.	2005-05-13

It slowly and thoroughly works through the progression of skills from first using clay to creating finished sculpture.  The chapters include information for teaching the skills, multiple examples of professional artwork that can be studied to view the technique at hand, tons of pictures of student work with the age of the student identified (very helpful for knowing how to set your expectations at a realistic level) and every chapter includes free exploration ideas as well as specific exercises.   <br /> <br />Chapters: <br /> <br />Before You Begin <br />Explorations <br />Making Sculpture <br />Sculpting in Relief <br />Animals <br />Heads and Faces <br />Figures <br />Improving Sculptures <br />Finishing and Displaying Sculpture <br /> <br />I have taken classes with Cathy Topal; she teaches in the Education department at Smith College, helping prospective teachers learn how to teach art.  The care and attention she has taken to laying out the exercises in this book clearly reflect this experience - she can think both like an experienced teacher of art and like a mentor to new teachers.  This book is a valuable purchase for any art teacher or homeschool family and can be used with students from age 4 to high school level.  It will grow with your child and can be used over and over to explore topics in more depth in subsequent years.  I give it my very highest recommendation.	2005-05-11

Instead I found a workbook for students, complete with spaces to write in your answers to the questions.  In many activities, the directions include waiting for the teacher to pass out certain materials such as specific cards to complete the activity.  Since there is a student workbook, there is no template for or description of the cards - I am left with no idea of what the exercise was supposed to accomplish.  In addition, this book is billed as having \\"authentic\\" math activities but learning fractions by dividing an imaginary pizza among the students is overused, weak, and not particularly authentic.  I was very disappointed by this book, especially considering the high price I paid.	2005-05-10

It is so difficult to teach children that metamorphosis doesn't just mean when a caterpillar becomes a butterfly - that it happens to all insects.  Observing the metamorphosis of more than one animal is the key.  This book is simply splendid alongside the Ladybug Land product from Highlights.com where you purchase a ladybug habitat and larvae and observe the process for yourself.

I remember hearing this book read out loud to the neighboring 4th grade class a few years ago; they didn't like it, neither did I.  Maybe this falls in the category of if you liked it when you were little, you like it as an adult due to the memories it brings back.  I decided to give the book another chance after reading all the positive reviews on Amazon and boy was I disappointed with my purchase.   <br /> <br />Why?  The plot is thin to say the least.  Here it is in a nutshell:  The weather brings the townspeople their food.  One day for no reason the weather stops giving them good things to eat so the people all move away.   <br /> <br />For no reason!!  That's not my idea of a plot twist.  The story ends with all the people living in a new town and adjusting to shopping from the grocery stores.  Hmmm.  I just don't get what all the fuss is about.  Yes, the illustrations are clever but I think that isn't enough to carry the book.  When the Sky Is Like Lace is a much better spin on the idea of weird weather and, since it's back in print, I recommend that you buy that one instead if you're looking for a fun quirky book to share with your children.	2005-04-21

From the reviews and the title and description of the book, this one seemed like a good candidate.  It arrived today and I opened it up; right on the cover page below \\"cool yoga, stretching and aerobic exercices for cool kids\\" it adds \\"ages 6 - 12.\\"  Well!  I wish I had known that before I bought it.<br /><br />Then I looked through the book and it lost another star.  Overall, I this book is geared for preteen kids to read to teach themselves yoga and I think the author underestimates the ability of this age group to tell when they're being talked down to -- this is based on the illustrations and descriptions of each pose.  The text is simplistic and the illustrations even more so.  They are cartoonish drawings, not even real photos of children doing the poses.  Like a Fish in Water by Isabelle Koch would be much better for this age group.	2005-04-21

I was a little surprised to read so many reviews which focused on the baby carrying aspect of this book.  Yes, in every example the child is carried by a family member.  Children are woven into the fabric of our lives and this books shows that very well.  But what I find most fascinating about this lovely book -- and what my daughter loves too -- is the sheer diversity of regions and lifestyles covered.   <br /> <br />Each two page spread (one large illustration, one page of text) contains two paragraphs of detailed kid-friendly information.  In just a few sentences you learn where the people live, what their climate and culture is like, and how they support their families.  Although it is extremely informative, the tone is very warm and not at all dry -- your chid will not feel as though he is being subjected to a geography lesson!  Many pages talk about the gathering of food and I find it fascinating to see the number of differences among us.  Yet each family is tied together by the shared love of their children.  It is a wonderful and reassuring message: we are different yet we are the same.  Another thing I especially like about this book is that it takes place in one day -- the pages go from dawn to dark -- and you can see how the day unfolds all around the world.   <br /> <br />The inside front and back covers of the book show a map of the world and the location of each family.  The last few pages of the book also give additional information about each culture.  The author and illustrator did an excellent job of demonstrating true  diversity.  Although we are used to seeing \\"multiculturalism\\" in the form of token comments about other regions of the world (often the same regions each time!), this book does an outstanding job.  No one culture gets more exposure than another and the information is presented in a respectful way.   <br /> <br />Lastly, the peoples shown in this book are:  the Maya, the Balinese, the Mbuti, the Tuareg, the Inuit, the Mandingo, the Hmong, the Yanomama, the Nepali, the Papuans, and the Quechua.  I highly recommend this book for all young children.  It could also be used very effectively in teaching, as was pointed out in an earlier review.	2005-03-15

This is because children experience color in a more vivid and emotional way than many of us.  Most adults have lost what they knew about color as children, having been taught that what there is to know about a color is its name and nothing more.  The seemingly simple task of preparing to paint is divided into five steps which are discussed in detail; tips for materials are also included.  Later chapters give ideas for setting the stage for a painting experience -- such as stories, poetry, seasons, or the moods of nature.  Innovative ways to introduce color mixing are also presented.   <br /> <br />The entire theory of how children perceive color, and its ramifications for introducing painting, is well expressed.  I found this book inspirational and would especially recommend it to any homeschooling parent.	2005-03-12
