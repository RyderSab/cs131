I don't think that I could give this copy that I bought away!  I bought it to buy baby products, starting with a simple crib and carseat.  I was more concerned about how the brands ranked...unfortunately the writers of this book were not.  The good thing that they did offer were tips on how to select a good crib/stroller/carseat/etc.  So if you want the how tos on buying this is a good reference.  If you want the &quot;what to buy&quot; stay away.  <br />I went out and bought the book &quot;Baby Bargains.&quot;  I found it extremely useful in telling you the history of brands and rating them all clearly on a A to D scale.  However that book wasn't very helpful in tips on how to check for a sturdy crib, or strong carseat.	2002-08-22

It is filled with color pictures, and a great section on \\"breaking the news to your boss\\" that I noticed my other books lacked.  It answers a lot of questions that books like \\"What to Expect When Expecting\\" don't really go into detail on such as the different types of chairs/positions for birth, the differences and effects of the pain medications, etc.<br />RE: Breastfeeding.  If you happen to be a woman who doesn't intend on breastfeeding, skip this section.  This section is why I dropped my rating on the book.  This woman admits to breastfeeding her child until 23 months you can hardly listen to much of her advice.   Outside of that she sees no possible reason to not at least try...<br />Besides that it is a great book.	2002-08-15

It gives them forms, step by step instructions, and may be a good reference for anyone in an HOA (Home Owners Association), but it doesn't give answerws that you may want, such as...&quot;If I ask the condos to fix the stairs leading to my condo, how long do they have to respond? How much can they leagally raise the rates each year?&quot; And other questions like these. It doesn't really tell you what to do if you feel that your rights have been violated either.

It takes place in Germany, with a group of men that have just returned from the holy wars to push out the infindels. It takes an honest approach to the destruction the catholic church wrecked on the world and on the lives of men (so I wouldn't recommend it to a person of this faith unless they can accept some critisism of the decisions of some popes). It talks about what means the pope used to put kings in power. The primary focus of this book is good versus evil. The man who falls into paganism versus the man who thinks he is doing God's work, only to find that it is doubtful. This book addresses the lineage of Jesus' brothers and sisters, politics in midevil Germany, and has a truly passionate love story between a man who loves his duke and loves a woman who insists on 100% of his allegence. I don't usually read anything but historical fiction, and I am very glad that I made the exception. It is also a beautifully bound book, that looks great on your shelf.	2001-08-28

It talks about the danger they were in and the predjudice they faced. I read it before an exam in religion to help me understand the new testament better...it worked! The story follows a young man who was illegally enslaved and then had his freedom purchased by Luke so that he could produce a silver chalice with the likeness of all of the prophets. In order to do so he has to travel around to their lectures and speeches, stay in their homes and become friends with them. It is very insightful. A nice long book, that should keep you busy for quite a few hours of reading time.	2001-08-28

Ms Winsor takes her main character, Amber through adventures that fit so believably into her plot that it is no wonder this book has become a classic.  She shows us parts of London that most authors only mention, the inside of the prision (not the tower of London, but where the commoners went), theaters from a courtisian's view, London during the plague, and what it was like to be a lady in waiting.  This book is an inside looking out story about a farmer's daughter who wants nothing more than to be close to royalty and the love of one man.  While it is known for being very risque, I found it tame by todays standards, and really nice to read.	2001-07-18

Mary of Scots is already her prisoner, and the Catholics are plotting against Elizabeth.  A beautiful woman named Kat forces her way on an adventure with her brother to spy for the queen's intelligence.  Unfortunately she falls in love with the man, Justin, that she is spying on. Justin catches her spying, yet he doesn't know who she is working for.  So he keeps her with him on his tratirous journey to Spain and the home of his Catholic cousin.  This book is well researched, historically accurate, a great story!  There are a couple of chapters that make you yawn, but for the most part you will be up all night.  She is good in the way that Sharon Kay Penman is.	2001-01-31

She begins  when Mary is born.  The book follows her to France and through the death of  her first husband.  It follows her from Queen of France to Queen of  Scotland.  George explains the strife between Queen Elizabeth and Mary,  explains Mary's suspicion in her second husband's death, explains the  rumour that her child (later to be King James) was from the wrong side of  the sheets.  A very catholic woman she managed to cause revolutions,  mismanage a country, be kidnapped multiple times, have a world famous  affair and adventually lose her head for loving the wrong man.  This is a  must read!!  Only slightly better than George's Henry VIII and equally as  good as Cleopoatra.  This is a thick book...something to last the most avid  reader at least a week.	2000-09-13

A woman who is  escaping the French Revolution runs to her wealthy cousin at Nethergate.   The cousin, Rosaleen, is jealous of her and due to the information given by  her maid Pratt, she marries her off to an abusive returned soldier.  The  story follows her to an inn, through murder, into the service of a girls  school, and back to Nethergate where Pratt now lives as a painful reminder  of her past.  The story is facinating in the way that Pulp Fiction is.  You  really don't know where it is going at first but you can't put it down.  I  would have given it 5 stars, but Norah Lofts always seems to ruin her own  books in the last couple of pages.	2000-08-23

This book is fun to read, and like all Norah Lofts  books-relaxing.  It isn't very taxing to read, but it is a great book  anyhow.  The only down side to the book is that the main female character,  Daisy, is an idiot.	2000-08-15

Its main characters are his  Lute Player Blondel, his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, his wife and her  sister.  This work of fiction carefully follows the thread of history,  explaining actions that Richard was criticized for, and filling in  history's blanks.  The book plays out during Richard's crusade.

From the pope's cousin that poisons people, to the mistresses of kings.  This book was cute and witty.  It has  black and white sketches.  This is not a good reference book, but it lets  you know about women that you've never heard of.  She included the smallest  incidents, such as the woman who sold bad meat from her cart to big  incidents, such as the young girl who organized her family to stab her  father to death (the lout deserved it).

I've never  read a more insightful book about any of the Bonapartes.	2000-04-27

Her depiction of Richard the III is unique as well as a pleasant change.  Her theories are well supported by fact, and make far more sense than the simple stamps of &quot;hunchback&quot; and &quot;murderer&quot;  placed on Richard the III by his enemies.  This book is followed by an  author's note supporting her novel as fact, and explaining any  discrepancies the book contained.  Overall a great read, a wonderful  reference, and a fabulous window to the mystery of the two princes in the  Tower of London.	2000-04-27

She truely gives you the affect of &quot;his side, her side and what really happened.&quot;  She shows the strength of Simon de Monfort, and the liberal views of his wife.  This is a wonderful read for any history buff,  anyone researching this era but tired of reading documentaries, or anyone  who would like to read good literature.  It is an acurate account followed  by an author's note to explain any liberties that she took in writting.	2000-04-27

It doesn't go much into gossip, it simply highlights the facts.  This would be a great reference book for the library of an adult down to the library of an young  adult in their early teens.	2000-04-27

I took it to school to prove to my friends that Unicorns did exist.  The photographs are so realistic and so enchanting.  Now as an adult I leave it on my coffee table.  It is gauranteed to tempt the curiosity of visitors who always pick  it up and comment on the quality of photographs and the beauty of the  beasts.  If your child is enchanted with unicorns or you are, take this  opportunity to slip back into the enchanted world where beautiful white  horned horses stand majestically on hill tops.	2000-04-27

It starts slightly before Stephen, Maude's cousin, swipes the throne right out from under her.  Although a good king, he was soft.  This book shows the damage that his  soft heart mixed with her steel backbone wrecked upon England.  Their  battle over the throne put the country into civil war.  This book is an  acurate discription of the lives of two amazing people.  A wonderfully fun  read as well as an inspirational book for a highschool student who tends to  dislike history.	2000-04-27

Great reading for a lazy Sunday afternoon, although not a very good biography.  This is a fictious story, based loosely on facts and evidence, not to be mistaken for a biography.   Although it is a very nice read.  It skips years quite quickly, and I would  only recommend it for someone who is already familiar with this period of  time, so that you can follow what is going on.	2000-04-14

Like Mary of Scots she became involved in a high profile affair.  This book is well researched, emotionally moving, and written with  a nearly extinct flare.  A very good read!	2000-02-01

While it is not as long as her more popular books, it was fabulous to have such a fun story that takes you into the lives of the average people of London and how they lived-not just the royalty.  As a mystery it was  charming, but not the best.  As a no brainer book with an educational  background-it was great.	2000-02-01

It was wonderfully researched, easy to read, captivating and flowing-very unique traits for a  &quot;history report.&quot;  It is filled with black and white pictures of  the Queen and other people in her life, giving you a face to the names.	1999-12-23
