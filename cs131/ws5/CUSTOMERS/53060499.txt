Tired of yelling at your counterpart in politics? <br /> <br />This books has some interesting insights into what makes them tick and gives each side an idea of how to better listen to one another. <br /> <br />His use of a family model is particularly interesting as his theory is that conservatives hold to a \\"strict father\\" model and liberals to a \\"nurturing parent\\" model.  Many of his examples fit perfectly into my experience in trying to convince conservatives with facts that they easily pass off as \\"liberal\\", \\"uninformed\\" (when it is them who rely solely on Fox for their \\"news\\") or something less polite. <br /> <br />One element that he does not address is that conservatives lack the ability to think in abstracts as well as liberals do - hence liberals longer explanations for things and conservative's tendency for bumper sticker slogans; \\"No Child Left Behind\\" - when it doesn't get any money it leaves ALL the children behind! <br />\\"Tort Reform\\" - cutting down on lawyer's earnings to defund the Democratic party.  \\"Tax relief\\" - Can you join a country club and pay no dues?  Then why expect our country to run smoothly when people are not contributing what they are able? <br /> <br />A must read for both the right and the left!	2004-11-07

Contrary to what your local GOP headquarters would like you to beleive...Democrats are NOT evil, or traitors or commies.  They are nice folks who value community over the individual. <br /> <br />This is a great read...as usual.	2004-10-31

Long but very informative and interesting finding out how one scientist's discoveries helped, or hindered, another's.<br />Great information about scientific ideas and break throughs throughout the ages.  I have used several ideas in this book in sermons.  For instance: If you enlarged a single atom to the size of a cathedral the nucleus would be the size of a house fly BUT 1000 times HEAVIER than the cathedral!<br />Our entire existance is made up of &quot;empty&quot; spaces!  Very mind blowing stuff on what we take for granted.	2004-03-15

Ever try to get through a Stephen Hawking book?  Then you know what I mean.  Bryson is witty and engaging and links together discoveries over the ages that have led us to where we are today.  Great reading and very illuminating - makes me want to learn more!<br />This one is a keeper.  I usually read and relist and sell here, but this one I'm keeping for future reference!	2004-02-19

Some of it was fairly boring but the idea of meeting different people for different REASONS (the REASON, not the person, being the main idea) was thought provoking.<br />I finished this in one day.	2004-02-11
US	53060499	R8Q9X9BIAPBDD	0525947647	857217799	Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them	Books	4	12	15	N	Y	Treason, this ain't	Mr. Franken relates his PERSONAL interactions with the likes of Ann pimping-for-the-right Coulter, Sean I-can-talk-louder-than-you Hannity and of course everyone's favorite blowhard Bill splotchy-face O'Really?.<br />Unlike Coulter's slanderous tome, this one actually talks about personal experiences and not conjecture leading no where.  I've read both this book and &quot;Treason&quot; and all I can say is that I was able to get past the first chapter in this book without wondering aloud, &quot;what is your point?!&quot;.<br />There is a bit too much profanity in this for my taste.  I guess Mr. Frankin wanted to witness to his ire or add shock value.  He did not succeed in either case, I don't beleive.  <br />Still, with Mr. Franken's &quot;psycho&quot; personality (walking up to people and asking them pointed questions, rather than the softball stuff they get on talking head shows) he does hit some obvious vulnerable spots of the Right - particularly their self imposed &quot;moral authority&quot;.  Mr. Franken, rightly proves, that they have neither the morals they claim, nor any type of real leadership/authority (as the Iraq bumbling has once again proven).  The Right is made up, primarily, of blustering empty suits who do just as many underhanded things as the Left (if not more) all the while saying all the culturally PC things that their side wants to hear (and believe about them).  The list, for instance, of Rightwingers who have cheated on thier spouses is every bit as long as the Left's - yet the Christian Right continues to support AND FORGIVE them, but not their counterparts.  This book clearly points out the hypocrisy in that very action - the ability to forgive one on your side but deamonize, ala Coulter and Rush Got-any-Drugs Limbaugh, others who disagree with you.  Rush's hypocrisy is not on display here, but with Rush, as with most Republicans, it is only a matter of giving them enough rope/power.	2004-02-09

As the author points out - all of which should be respected (except maybe the having sex with 70 virgins version).<br />The lessons learned deal with things we can do now - letting go of hate, learning to love, forgiving etc.  It is a very thought provoking small book. I got it yesterday and finished it today.<br />It may not change your life, but it just might change your mind...about life.	2004-01-27

Funny how Alterman calls for a more mature discourse in 1993 and Coulter's drek comes out years later calling for the exact same thing....but then goes on a trashing dance all over those she opposes.<br />Alterman just calls for less BS, ala Coulter and Drugboy Rush, and more honest &quot;where are our similarities?&quot; discourse.  Of course the overly moralistic Right takes offense at being called on the carpet for their lack of adult ideas, but hey, the truth hurts.<br />When our leaders can begin to think outside the box for solutions (considering all the &quot;conservative&quot; ideas have gotten us to where we are today) about what ails our world, then we might find some solutions.  Getting &quot;tough&quot; on things has not worked on drugs, poverty or crime.  Why anyone thinks it would work on terrorism just shows the neanderthal thinking that comes into play when people have been convinced, ala Bush et al, to be afraid of one another.<br />Until there is a change in leadership in America, we will be doomed to continue to commit the same mistakes over and over and over again.  Cold war &quot;warriors&quot; (people who got wealthy off of the defense contracts paid by you and I) can think of no better solution than to &quot;go to war&quot; for everything from &quot;defense&quot; to economic stimulation.  When in fact developing alternative fuels (a &quot;liberal&quot; idea) would make us more indepedent of the fuel in the Middle East, would dry up the money there and would dry up the funds being filtered to Al Quida from such areas.  As long as we feed the monster of the Middle East, we had better be prepared for it to continue to bite the hand that feeds it.  But that is just so much &quot;liberal&quot; thinking....an so out of the box!<br />Alterman nails the Right for being Wrong, on so many levels - which is something they can not stand.  Just look at the arrogance of Cheney, Rumsfeld and the like who, due to their old whiteman/priveleged status think that everyone should believe them, no questions asked.  They ARE life long politicians aren't they?  Or are only life long democrats/liberals the ones who lie?  To take the word of ANY life long politician is to naively follow at one's peril.	2004-01-08

Heaven, Hell, the millenium, eschatology, revelation are all ignored. For Cone, Christian Theology means nothing if it doesn't help free the oppressed in America now.  The promise of a far off heaven where everything is wonderful does nothing to releive that pain that oppressed Black Americans feel today. He asks if he should stand by and watch the children suffer while telling them to be patient and wait for the promised land. Cone connects Jesus with his plight when he says that God chose to reveal himself as a poor, oppressed Jewish carpenter-not some one wealthy and powerful.<br />  He admits his own shortcomings in the preface for not dealing as effectively as he could have with women's and other minorities issues. His focus is freedom for Black America-for this he makes no apologies!	1997-10-31
