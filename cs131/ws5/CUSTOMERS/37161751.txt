Ms. Bird's book is quite interesting if you were an avid follower of the Peterson trial.  Since she met the Petersons as an adult, she was able to form an initial mature opinion about the Petersons and happily for everyone, it was positive.  Being the good and devoted sister she strived to be, she continually gave Scott's smooth, cunning and odd behavior benefit of the doubt regarding the disappearance of his much-loved-by-everyone wife, Laci.  Anne's husband soon had reservations about Scott's guilt and peculiar alibis, but Anne remained consistently insistent of his innocence to the detriment of her marriage.  Gradually, her perception and eventual decisive realization and acceptance of Scott's true character forced her to see him as he truly is: pathological liar, sociopath and double murderer.      Ms. Bird's book is not dynamic, but it is interesting.  I'm sure it was very therapeutic for her to write it and it offers the public another perspective into this riveting, extremely sad incident and all the people involved.	2005-03-22

TESTING MISS TOOGOOD is enjoyable but it did not quite live up to the book's description of a promising great read.

I felt it was overall underdeveloped and the secondary characters were not explained well enough to know who they are and where they exactly fit.  The mystery aspect of the villain, Le Chat Soyeux and hero, Brother Juste is an interesting aspect, but I felt it took too much from the main storyline of the romance between Lord Dominic and Fleur.

Wisconsin, Summer 1840 <br /> <br />Handsome, hardworking and wealthy eight-month-old widower Josh Ingalls knew why he couldn't seem to find and keep a decent nanny.  The several previous nannies either had marriage in mind or they couldn't withstand his four rambunctious and unruly children.  Three girls and a boy: Ginny-age eight, Cassie-age four, Hannah-age eight months and Drew-age somewhere in between. <br /> <br />Because of her distressed family's grave situation and dreadful scandal, tall, forthright and trouser wearing Annie Martin desperately needed the job of weeding Josh Ingalls garden.  One day while doing this back-braking job in the hot sun, Annie suddenly felt a severe sting in her rear end.  Seeing that the little hellion Drew shot her with a slingshot, Annie chased after the escaping children and caught up with them under a tree.  What she didn't know is that she reprimanded the little devils within earshot of the foreboding Mr. Ingalls.  Hearing the scolding, Josh approached Annie and the children and immediately demanded to know what the problem was and where in the hell their nanny was at!  Josh knew he'd have to fire another nanny.  Damn!  Another nanny wouldn't work out!  This is when Annie decided she wanted to apply for the recently vacated position. <br /> <br />Annie Martin never set out to become a nanny, but she needed the better paying position and by darn she was going to make the best of it!  No matter what!  And besides, if she could bring the Ingalls together and help make them a loving family, she knew it would all be worth it.  What Annie didn't expect was to fall in love with this dysfunctional family but she knew there would never be a permanent place in their lives for her.  There was just no way anyone could be expected to overlook her secret shameful scandal.  Or could they?  <br /> <br />THE NANNY is another delightful book by Judith Stacy!  It's quick and easy to read.  A winner! <br /> <br />THE NANNY is one in the Returnto Tyler series.
