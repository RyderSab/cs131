References to a 'Pope Joan' or 'Pope John' appear in some medieval sources, but they are not part of official church history. \\"Pope Joan\\" by Donna Woolfolk Cross tells the story of what might have happened. A young woman disguises herself as a man and uses her quick wits and gifted mind-as well as a hefty measure of luck-to rise from humble origins to become the only female pope. .... This is 'ripped from the headlines' stuff-tangled and improbable, yes, but it's also finely written and satisfying. Some readers will quibble with the number of fortunate coincidences, the love story thread, and the sheer improbability of the premise, but Cross' \\"Pope Joan\\" is also a well-researched depiction of medieval European life, especially the strictures placed on women. Even if you don't buy the story, you should buy the book.	2002-02-21

There is not an iota of sappy sentiment in \\"Ironweed\\". In fact, the story of Francis Phelan, former third baseman for the Washington Senators, now a 58-year-old alcoholic bum, can be downright depressing, but not relentlessly so. Although Francis is living with the legacy of his lifetime of mistakes, big mistakes including three deaths and the specters of those he wronged in life, he somehow manages to maintain some measure of dignity and self respect, as do his king-of-the-road cronies. Francis, while flawed, symbolizes belief in the possibility of forgiveness and hope of redemption. Highly recommended.	2002-02-21

It is dark, weird, and confusing, but that's not all it is. In &quot;Borderliners&quot;, Peter Hoeg has absolutely captured the rush and the crush of adolescence, with its attendant aching, uncertainty, and urgency. The twist in this story, and what is likely to frustrate many readers, is Hoeg's use of time as a plot device. The characters, teenagers in a mindnumbingly banal but wickedly punitive correctional boarding school, discover an ability to manipulate the passage of time, which both benefits them, and subjugates them further to authority. Repeatedly, Hoeg deviates into long-winded passages about the philosophy of time, which do nothing to advance the story, and only served to irk me. I didn't like it, but if you were a paranoid, obsessive teenager, and enjoy revisiting your adolescent angst, &quot;Borderliners&quot; is your story, and you're welcome to it.	2002-02-19

As other reviewers have said, I found Anne Fadiman remarkably evenhanded when relating either the Lees' story, or the health care professionals' stories. Neither parents nor doctors did all the right things or all the wrong things, even for the right reasons. Fadiman also brought me right into the story. I could sympathize with the Lees' bewilderment and frustration with Lia's doctors, and I completely understood the doctors' frustration with the Lees. I read this book eagerly, which is not all that common for me with nonfiction. Pick it up. You won't regret it.	2002-01-03

I got the point, and I think the premise was ingenious, but it was such a wierd and twisted story about dull, self-indulgent, and mean-spirited characters (Oly excepted, mostly) that I just couldn't make myself care about it. I'm no stranger to either the wierd or twisted, but there just wasn't much to like in &quot;Geek Love&quot;.  <br />Unlike my book group, which hated this book so much that not only didn't read it, they didn't even show up to complain about it (most unlike them), I found it compelling enough to finish. I kept hoping for a flash of wisdom or true beauty, but Dunn didn't deliver.<br />Maybe my expectations were too high. I was sort of hoping that this would be another &quot;Ballad of the Sad Cafe&quot; and it so wasn't.	2001-12-27

I'm interested in the afterlife, and certainly interested in accounts of near death experiences, but &quot;Passage&quot; felt ... contrived. The premise that researchers had come up with a drug that could induce a near death experience was very interesting to me, and the book sounded great, but in my opinion, it just didn't deliver. As other reviewers have said, Connie Willis may have missed the boat, symbol-wise, and various little subplots popped up, but really didn't go anywhere. I found the main characters likeable, but not particularly deep. My biggest quibble with the book was its pace, which was sluggish at best. I've read that Willis wanted readers to puzzle along with the characters, but I didn't enjoy the puzzling. It just made me impatient. So many people have raved about her, that I'll try another of her books, but &quot;Passage&quot; just didn't win me over.	2001-12-27

I can't remember ever having read a romance/vampire/mystery. And I would never have expected it to be good! I picked this up from a friend's bookshelf as I was headed for the subway, and was so hooked that I missed my stop. Laurell Hamilton can really tell a story. Her ability to matter of factly mix supernatural details into a detective story is impressive, and I liked the way she has created characters with heart and humor, who are not at all cute. So many authors can't do this well at all. Although this book was a departure for me, I'll be reading more of this series, and I'll be reading it eagerly	2001-11-30

The premise is great, but the execution doesn't hold up as well. Gimbel is a strong writer, and her narrative is evocative and moving, but she organized her material in the wrong way. Instead of a memoir, she should have just written about someone else. What's really interesting here is the story of Fidel Castro's lover Naty, her mother Dona Natica, and Naty and Castro's daughter Alina. It's got everything: passion, intrigue, mystery, and betrayal. If Gimbel had concentrated on Naty and the Revuelta family, the book would have been much stronger. For example, by inserting her own maternal abandonment issues into Naty's story, she weakened the book overall. On the other hand, it can't have been easy to try to pull the truth out of these women who each wanted to control their stories, none of whom were above changing details to make themselves (Dona Natica and Alina) or Castro (Naty) more sympathetic or more impressive. Although flawed, &quot;Havana Dreams&quot; is a poignant, romantic tale, much like that of Cuba itself.	2001-11-16

In this case, it was worthwhile. Anne Tyler sometimes turns me off with concerns too domestic for my taste, or just so bound up in their own problems that I don't find them interesting. Beck was different for me. When she had occaision to stop and think about her life, she did a little mild exploration, and then rethought her hypothesis and its outcome. And she did all this in the same stalwart, responsible way she'd really lived her whole life. I liked her, and her story.<br />Most of us don't launch our lives with grand plans that explode into something even more grand. We spend our lives, just livin'. Doing whatever seems right at the time, like Beck.<br />\\"Back When We Were Grownups\\" is not a family saga on an epic scale, but it does touch on certain universal truths. At some point in our lives, we all look around and wonder, \\"How did I wind up here?\\" Poppy said it best on his 100th birthday, &quot;There is no true life.

It helped me learn about love, and, in fact, it helped me learn how to love. Carson McCullers' description of the quality of love perfectly expresses why or why not we find the experience of love satisfactory. In fact, the grubby wierdness of the story underlines the premise that true, noble love transcends and transforms the individual. If you've never read it, or if you were a youngster when you did, pick up this book, just for &quot;Ballad of the Sad Cafe&quot;. You won't regret it.	2001-11-14

It's hard to read about love that's without humor, without happiness. It's especially difficult to read about a twisted, obsessive love that spirals out of control. And when emotional chaos seems to span generations, the reading gets particularly bleak. At the same time, Anita Shreve's \\"The Weight of Water\\" is a fascinating read. Partly the isolated and soulless location which infects even the reader with same depressing hopelessness felt by the characters, partly the brutal violence at the core of this story of tortuous passion and fierce suspicion--I read this at a frantic pace, caught up in this vividly awful story. Even months afterward, merely catching sight of the cover again put me right back on Smuttynose. Right back in the mare's nest of emotion which shattered a family. Not a pleasant book, but powerfully affecting.	2001-11-12

Readers who loved the original WoO may be disappointed in a darker, more adult &quot;Wicked&quot;, and readers who've been served up too much of the publicity hype are going to feel that it was overrated. Not to mention all the fantasy readers who feel that Maguire doesn't cover any new ground. Given their biases, they've all got legitimate points of view. <br />Me, I'm somewhere in the middle. I brought it to my book group and consequently, they felt they'd &quot;discovered&quot; it, and they really enjoyed it. Really, they all loved it, and they don't ALL love anything, except for maybe &quot;The Sparrow&quot; (Mary Doria Russell).<br />Maguire is a clever writer, and he's fleshed out Oz in a pretty complete way. Although it's not without flaws, &quot;Wicked&quot; is so much better written than so much of what gets printed today, it's not surprising that so many people really took to it. <br />I liked it too.	2001-11-06

I thought this book was great, especially since it made my reading list as a &quot;should&quot; not a &quot;want to&quot;. Reading this novel, and keeping track of all the players, with a full understanding of all the political issues of the time made me feel smart. (Trust me, I realize how dumb you think I am now.) This is what the other reviewers are talking about when they describe &quot;Scandalmonger&quot; as being what history class should have been like, and when they describe how engrossing they find each episode. Safire engages the reader by providing enough information on each character to bring them alive, and his explanations of the motivations of the characters make them believable. He is also highly successful in revealing the story-behind-the-story, which readers always love. Add &quot;Scandalmonger&quot; to your reading list. You won't be disappointed.	2001-11-06

I've heard people rave about this book, and it is a charming little story, quite lovingly written. I understand why some readers have responded so enthusiastically to this and the spate of other novels that have come out recently that involve Dutch painters. Others are &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot; about a fictional Vermeer painting, &quot;Johanna&quot;, about the widow of Van Gogh's brother and even &quot;Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister&quot; which includes a character referred to as 'the Master' (really the best of the bunch). It seems a little mean-spirited to criticize this book too harshly because I enjoyed it too, but the story is small, and the characters' concerns are uber-domestic. Even the writing is simplistic, verging on Hemingwayesque, not a plus. I'd give it a B-, and since somebody has probably already optioned the rights to it, I recommend waiting for the movie.	2001-10-09

I was disappointed in Mariette in Ecstacy, but was pleased to find Hitler's Niece a much stronger book. (Mariette was just too darned atmospheric with too little plot or resolution for me.) <br />One of Hansen's strengths, in my opinion, is his ability to render a convincing portrait of an environment dominated by men (probably has something to do with why I prefer the westerns). He's quite successful with Hitler and his inner circle. Hansen's Hitler, manipulative, cowardly, and vain, suited my existing point of view. I also found it oddly satisfying to see Hitler's cronies depicted as loony, dysfunctional social misfits. <br />This story is a train wreck, of course, I knew that Geli would come to a bad end and it would be Hitler's fault, but I kept reading anyway. The weirder the relationship became, the more interested I became, and consequently, the more believable I found the story. I enjoyed it.	2001-08-23

However, the characters are all so estranged (and to be frank, strange) that it is difficult to care about them. Instead of pulling together to weather the strife of civil war, these characters, and the communities they inhabit, withdraw and hide from danger and uncertainty. <br />Michael Ondaatje succeeds in making me feel a bit of the anxiety and uncertainty of the Sri Lankan experience, but at the cost of engaging me in the story. I got the point, but don't want to do anything with it. <br />Ondaatje can sure turn a phrase, and he can capture a mood like no one else. If you're a serious word person, who reads for love of language, or if atmosphere alone is enough for you, don't miss this novel. On the other hand, if you're a recreational reader who enjoys a linear story, Anil's Ghost isn't for you.	2001-08-22

Meeting the challenge with an engaging, well-researched novel is an even bigger accomplishment. <br />My book group read this recently and gave it a big &quot;thumbs up&quot;. Each reader responded to different aspects of the book, but they all enjoyed it because it really is a great read: well-rounded characters, interesting plot, finely told details. Consensus of the group: &quot;It took us to a time and place where we'd never been.&quot; <br />If you've got a biblical bent, the story of Rachel and Leah (as it might have been) will be fleshed out for you, and you'll get a new look at the relationship Joseph (coat of many colors) might have really had with his brothers. <br />Even if you're not up on the Old Testament, you can enjoy this sprawling story of a family just as it is.	2001-08-16

I was actually so interested in the characters, that I looked up photos of them so that my mental picture would be accurate. It's not easy to make blow-by-blow battle accounts engrossing, but Shaara manages this and more. Even though I knew the outcome of the battle, this was still a suspenseful account. <br />One book won't make me an expert on it, but this novel really brought the Civil War to life for me.	2001-03-12

All too often, new mysteries are just variations on the same old formula, but this was one  good novel; well-defined characters, vivid setting, and a complex plot, not  to mention a main character sleuth who experiences growth throughout the  novel. I'd recommend it to anyone.<br />I've already picked up &quot;The  Sculptress&quot; which I happened to catch on PBS more than a year ago.

(Betty J. Eadie's &quot;Embraced by the Light&quot; and James Redfield's &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; had  similarly let me down on a long flight.)<br />I find that much of contemporary  spiritual literature, although frequently heartfelt and sincere, is glib  and unsubstantial. &quot;The Cloister Walk&quot; was different. It was  thoughtful and aware, but maybe better than that, it was smart. Although  the author's preoccupation with her status as a tortured poet was less than  riveting, I appreciated the context that Kathleen Norris' scholarly  impulses provided and I found that I could agree with many of her various  points of view. (That whole virgin martyrs phenomenon does have a wierd  legacy.)<br />As I read, I felt much of my self-generated tension drain away  from me. Norris took me along on the journey with her, and I was glad to  go. She offered me a sense of the peace I so desperately craved.<br />Let me  say this, I'm a voracious and consumptive reader.
