For years he has been doing a dead-on impersonation of William Faulkner.  He has legions of prestigious admirers, most of whom probably don't note the impersonation because they haven't read or haven't remembered Faulkner.  This book is McCarthy's answer to SANCTUARY, Faulkner's crack at writing a potboiler.  As usual, McCarthy's narrator sounds like he's straining--like Rich Little after one show too many.  McCarthy is affected, inauthentic, and shamelessly derivative.  He does have a way with violence; the book is blood-soaked, like Blood Meridian, McCarthy's bid to outdo the ILIAD on the gore meter.  There are some novel touches--the killer uses the tool they use to puncture the skulls and brains of cattle--and the book put me off beef.  But McCarthy's argument (evil and bloodshed are destined to dominate the world; man is the basest of creatures), though heartfelt, is nothing new.  The book, which Scott Rudin has optioned, feels like it was just begging to be made into a successful film, unlike All the Pretty Horses.  McCarthy's a fraud but, as someone once said, sincerity is the most important quality.  Once you learn to fake that, you've got it made.	2005-09-03
US	52468382	R2CRLBB5AGHQO1	0316172324	968642731	Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking	Books	5	6	8	N	N	One of the Best Nonfiction Books I've Read	Blink discusses and describes the value of intuitive thinking, but it explains that intuition is not ESP but the result of a vast amount of knowledge and experience properly ordered to facilitate an immediate \\"still small voice\\" (my quotes, not Gladwell's) of certainty that we should heed.  Gladwell goes on to explain what happens when intuition seems to fail, and why, and how to avoid that.  He uses as an example of failed intuition the tragic shooting by police of Amadou Diallou and the analysis is superb.  His chapter of facial recognition and discerning exactly what someone is feeling or thinking from the briefest flickers of expression is worth the price of the book, which is a fascinating read superbly written.  Never dull, informative, highly useful.	2005-02-21

The book is infused with feeling, fully-realized characters, stinging insights and observations, a compelling if repulsive protagonist, and the textures, smells, and temperatures of the characters and their city.  Told in first person, it feels at times like one has stumbled on to a diary written by a figure who is an unpdated Raskolnikov.  David Sedaris said on NPR that one of the reasons he feels life is worth living is the hope that Sharma will write a second novel.  I was very curious to see what kind of book could live up to that praise.  The answer is, this kind of book, a great novel, that deals with ugly, unpleasant specifics and tacitly forces the reader to confront his or her own failings, sins, crimes large and small, immoralities, and humanity.  As for the negative reviews on this site, readers shouldn't blame the mirror for providing an accurate reflection.	2005-01-30

Because there's a mass of iron below the handle, the weight is unbalanced, and it's up to you to wield it right, which isn't easy.  So what's the big deal?  The big deal is, learning to handle and exercise with kettlebells works virtually every muscle in the body.  It gives you a terrific cardio workout.  And it gives you what they call \\"functional strength,\\" which is the kind of strength a wrestler needs to gut-wrench an opponent, or a mother needs to lift and carry her kid.  I've trained with weights for over 20 years, and I was skeptical when I first read about kbells.  I took a chance and bought the book, then a (roughly 32 lb.) kbell.  The first workout had me gasping, dripping with sweat, and feeling like I'd been wrestling five bears.  After a shower, though, I felt great.  Like I COULD wrestle five bears.  And I gained size and definition--fast.  Now, 32 pounds is no big deal for me.  A 32 lb dumbbell is like a toy.  But the kbell felt like it weighed 60 lbs. because of the weird displacement.  Anyway, the book took me through the basic exercises, and gave me a fitness tool and technique that's time-tested and wonderfully effective.  It's a good idea to get the DVD that goes with the book so you can see the exercises and get a real idea of the cadence and form, but the book in itself is excellent.  Pavel is a masterful trainer and an engrossing, amusing writer.  This book, and the kbells it talks about, are fitness tools worth their weight in gold.  If I could give it 7 stars I would.  The only caution is this:  kbells are not easy.  They can be dangerous if you don't follow the book's directions.  And they're not for anyone who's looking for a relatively easy and pleasant workout, like cycling to CNN.  But if you want a kick-butt workout that will give you real results for your effort--and I mean effort--this is the best deal in town.	2004-08-29

The diet boils down to this:  eat as little as possible during the day, eat as much as you want at night, and try to train on an empty stomach.  The rest is the science or pseudo-science supporting those recommendations.  I can't say yet from personal experience whether the diet works for me, but it's good to go to bed feeling full and guilt-free--I know I'll burn it off the next day; at least, I hope so.  But the most intriguing thing about the book is this:  Hofmekler is the nutrition guy for Dragon Door, the publisher.  Dragon Door is also the publisher for Pavel Tsatsouline's books and products (WHICH ARE EXCELLENT).  Yet Pavel, in Power To the People, recommends something called The Anabolic Diet Book (no, it has nothing to do with steroids) by Mauro DiPasquale, M.D.  (I ordered the book and am waiting.  I'll give you an update when it arrives.  Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't stock it.)  So, long story short, go to your local bookstore, browse Warrior Diet, make some notes, save $24.95, and if you want to give it a go, shut your mouth until dinner, then chow like a champ.	2004-07-04

But when you link the poses with a connecting movement called a vinyasa, the prana is amplified and strengthened.  I never understood before why Ashtanga and Ashtanga-based yogas emphasize vinyasa.  That said, this is a good basic book on Ashtanga-based yoga by a gifted practitioner.  Whether I would choose this over, say, Power Yoga, is a hard question.  Apart from the vinyasas, much of the information is basic stuff contained in a dozen other hatha yoga books.  If you're looking for the best book on classical Ashtanga practice, I recommend skipping this one in favor of David Swenson's (Doug's brother) masterpiece ASHTANGA YOGA, THE PRACTICE MANUAL.  David Swenson's videotapes also are excellent and, having had the good fortune to take a class with David, I can tell you he's also a very nice guy.  Caveat:  if you are in fact looking for a book on Ashtanga yoga or Ashtanga-based practices and cannot find a good teacher, videos are a must.  You have to see the movements and the coordination with the breathing to understand it.  So, if you are a collector of yoga books, Doug Swenson's MASTERING THE SECRETS would be a fun addition to the collection.  If you are seeking a text to learn from, it's a good book but you'll need supplemental materials and are probably better off with his brother David's most excellent book--so good, it's even bound to remain opened to whatever page you're using as you work out so you can refer to it easily.  Doug's book is nice.  David's is a truly great work on this subject.	2004-01-31

Norbu Rinpoche articulates the ineffable.  His emphasis on going beyond the limitations of any particular dogma or tradition is also so refreshing and, in my experience, unusual that I knew I was reading the words of a master.  The book is inspiring.  It made me want to put its teachings into practice.  It's also highly practical and written to be completely clear.  Norbu Rinpoche's unadorned, down-to-earth way of communicating sublime and subtle concepts is wonderful.  His reputation is superb and this book is a good example of why he is so highly regarded as a master teacher.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  It's just great.	2004-01-10

In prose that is wonderfully clear, the Dalai Lama explains the fundamentals in theory and practice.  Everything is concise, logical, and practical.  Not everything is easy--particularly the part about having compassion for one's enemies--but it all makes complete sense.  You also get a sense of the Dalai Lama's enormous warmth and wisdom, which inform every sentence.  It's brief, clear, persuasive, user-friendly and useful.	2003-12-31

It's a tough topic.  But this book is a primer on a gift-basket of techniques in Tibetan Buddhist meditation.  Clear, encouraging, simple instructions make it easy to read and easy to use.  I'm a lousy meditator with a mind that loves to start jumping from topic to topic.  This book is the first tool to help me start developing past all that.  As another reviewer pointed out, this book is teaching in a specific tradition.  If you have some knowledge about Tibetan Buddhism and know it's not for you, skip this book.  If you're new to meditation, or open to techniques in this tradition, this book is a gem.	2003-11-25

In a small town near Rome I had one of the most memorable meals of my life.  In Naples I had a plate of spaghetti with fresh tomato sauce and basil so good if I'd dropped dead right then and there, I would have died a contented man.  When I got home, I wanted to recreate the food I had in Italy.  This book, and all the others La Place has written, showed me how.  I have other Italian cookbooks and I love them all.  What distinguishes LaPlace's books is that she makes cooking a simple, quick undertaking so you don't feel like every meal's the final exam at Cordon Bleu.  Along with speed and simplicity, she captures the improvisational, unpretentious essence of the best Italian cooking.  Flavors are allowed to speak for themselves, they get amplified, not sauced over or cooked out of existence.  The results of her recipes are dishes so fresh, easy, and authentic if I sit back afterwards over a cup of authentic Italian coffee (made according to La Place's directions in the excellent La Bella Cucina), I can almost hear Vesuvius rumble, almost hear the waves in the Bay of Naples.  No one who buys any of La Place's books will regret it.	2003-11-11

I'm not sure what Cervantes would have made of some of Faulkner's more troublesome work, but the world has designated Don Quixote the Father of the Modern Novel and perhaps the greatest novel ever.  I'm a fan of this book and a habitual (some would say neurotic) comparer of translations.  Since I don't read of speak Spanish, I have to rely on the English translations that have been published.  There are three that are worthwhile:  Ormsby's, Samuel Putnam's and now Edith Grossman's.  Grossman, who is the translator of Garcia Marquez's books into English, has produced a translation that's contemporary and authentic--somehow, not an oxymoron.  It has a fresher feel than Putnam's (the translation Nabokov used when teaching the book), though I wouldn't say it supplants Putnam.  If you're looking for a copy of Don Quixote in English, Grossman's translation is a good first choice.  She manages to maintain the feel of the language Cervantes wrote in (as far as I can tell) yet her translation, as the NY Times reviewer noted, is as readable as the latest novel from Philip Roth.  You can't go wrong with Putnam or Grossman, but on this one, I have to give the nod to Grossman.	2003-11-04

If I knew as much about anything as he knows about everything, I'd be in good shape.  I also have a problem with a guy who's clearly overweight telling me how to lose pounds.  All my life I've struggled with weight.  I continue to struggle with it.  And this book didn't tell me anything I didn't know.  If you have very little insight into your eating patterns, this might be a good buy.  It will make you examine why you eat, how you feel about your weight, exercise, etc.  If you don't need that kind of thing, this will probably end up taking valuable shelf space.  Full of Phil's tough love, rah rah approach to dieting, the book is focused on the psychology of fatness and eating.  Not to oversimplify, but I'm fat because I really love to eat, I'm a terrific cook, and when it becomes a choice between sensible portions, unappetizing foods, and slimness or the sheer animal joy of wolfing down a bowl of spaghetti with tomato sauce and bacon, then chicken marsala followed by gelato, I've been sliding toward gluttony.  I know that.  To re-stoke the fire of discipline, I have to put my mind to it and get off the couch and exercise.  I know that, too.  And if you feel like a kindred spirit, save your money and buy a jump rope and a padlock for the refrigerator.  Meanwhile, Dr. Phil ought to lay off the pork chops himself.	2003-11-02

These are the most expensive home-learning language courses on the planet.  But you can find them at greatly reduced prices if you shop around on the internet or buy them used.  And even at full price, they're worth it.  The lessons are ingeniously designed.  There's no reading, no writing.  You learn by listening and speaking.  It's not so much a rote process as an installation.  The language slowly but surely gets installed into you, so you start thinking in it, and listening to it without having to translate it into English to understand.  I recently started Level III and am greatly satisfied.  But I did find that I felt a need for some extra help with verbs, so I bought Italian Verb Drills, which is superb.  Rather than blowing a lot of money and time traveling back and forth to an Italian language school to get to an intermediate level, I strongly recommend Pimsleur Levels I to III, Italian Verb Drills, a dictionary, and either 500 Italian Verbs or Teach Yourself Italian Verbs.  I don't what I'll do after finishing Pimsleur III, but spero la fare en Italia.	2003-11-01

The kind of laughs that bring tears to your eyes and pain to your stomach.  This guy is truly funny, and all of his humor is based on truth.  The book is also written with tremendous warmth, and could be subtitled &quot;Pasta Fazool for the Goomba Soul.&quot;  It's actually inspiring.  And--how's this for a plus--it contains some fantastic and easy recipes.  I feel like I got more than my money's worth from this book--laughs, inspiration, and some great Italian meals.	2003-10-05

As a trial lawyer and former assistant district attorney, I read this book expecting to learn the nuts and bolts of cross-examination.  What a disappointment.  The book is obsolete and contains virtually nothing of any use to today's trial lawyer.  It's a fun read, and it's interesting to see some of the examinations excerpted, but using this book to learn to cross-examine is probably close to malpractice.  There are excellent books and tapes on the topic if you want practical &quot;how to&quot; info.  This isn't among them.  Still, it's worth reading as a piece of legal history.	2003-10-03

The name Duse has been synonymous with the highest possible attainment in acting, even though she is little known outside the theater.  Helen Sheehy has written a detailed, even scholarly biography that stands head and shoulders over the other previous bio in English, by William Weaver.  Sheehy succeeds, as far as one can, at analyzing and dissecting otherworldly Genius.  But the excellence of Sheehy's book also makes it an unbearable tease.  Duse was a stage actress.  No traces of her greatness remain, save one thirty minute film that is maddeningly difficult to obtain; for some reason, showings of the film are as rare as UFO sightings.  In my mind the film has attained the status of a relic.  And I've yet to see it.  Frustration aside, Sheehy does much to unveil the very private views of her subject on art and life.  I certainly wouldn't recommend this bio to anyone with only a casual interest in acting or theater; however, for anyone with a substantial interest in dramatic art, this bio is simply a must.	2003-09-22

This is the real thing.  The exercises work, and fast.  I found myself coughing and (hopefully) cleansing my lungs after the first time trying the book's basic breathing exercise.  I started adding the physical movements.  The effect is more profound than that of any other system I've tried.  It's hard to describe.  Yoga leaves me feeling strong and calm.  Tai chi leaves me feeling centered and powerful and grounded.  Seamm-Jasani leaves me feeling healthy but also incredibly clear-headed, as if my ability to see into situations and things has been markedly improved, my anxiety relieved, my ability to get things done dramatically enhanced.  I also strongly recommend The Five Tibetans.  Bottom line:  this book is worthwhile, to say the least.  It's authentic, highly effective, and fascinating.  The explanations are clear and the movements are graduated so the early ones are particularly gentle (but supply quite a workout) and suitable for just about anyone, of any age or gender.  I particularly recommend this book for people who are elderly or frail and looking for a system to help restore them to health.	2003-09-13

On the other hand, if I do them, I find I have a high but even level of energy all day, as opposed to when I don't do them, and feel like I could fall asleep on a bed of nails, any time.  I just find it hard to believe that they're as potent as the testimonials say.  Also, the book's story of the exercises' discovery seems to me to be pure bunk.  I'd be willing to bet Peter Kelder, whoever that was, assembled or was taught four exercises widely taught in various forms of yoga and calisthenics, and added the other &quot;spinning&quot; exercise based on observation of dervishes, lore, etc.  Still, if you're willing to give it a whirl, no pun intended, the book might have a lot to offer you.  I certainly find the exercises very valuable, the testimonials--assuming they're authentic--are spectacular, but talk to me in ten years; if my hair's gone or gray, or worse, I'll write to the publisher for a refund.	2003-09-10

(You can't go wrong!)	Fugeddabout it!  The best way to learn to speak Italian.  Took these cassettes to Italy with me when I was about a third of the way through them.  I had no problem getting around and communicating, even in towns where little or no Inglese was spoken.  I couldn't hold a deep conversation, or a lengthy one, but to be able to survive in a foreign language when still completing level I was really gratifying.  And recently I bought Ultimate Italian as a supplement.  It's good, but nowhere near Pimsleur.  Pimsleur is brilliantly designed to lock the learning into your memory.  You find yourself thinking in Italian, not translating back and forth in your head.  There are, of course, less expensive vendors of Pimsleur to be found on the internet, e.g., languagelovers.com.  But the course is worth every Euro.  I can't wait to start Level II.  If you can afford it, and your interest is chiefly speaking Italian rather than reading and writing it, this is tops.  If, on the other hand, you want to read and write in Italian, you should look for a different course or supplement this one.	2003-08-23

Probably no one has been the cause of more bloodshed than Christ--not Christ the rabbi and, for some, the savior, but Christ the Idea.  From the Crusades through the enslavement of the Jews, the proselytization of Hindus, Muslims, etc. the Christians have thrust their understanding of their cult down the world's collective throat.  And it stands to reason.  As the Bible explains, Esau would create a nation that would be the eternal enemy of the Jews.  The nation was Rome, and the method of bequeathing the anti-semitism to future generations long after the fall of the Empire was Catholicism as distorted by the Vatican.  This form of Christianity was and is an effort by the descendants of Esau to reclaim the birthright he sold to his brother.  Pagels excavates Christianity from political and economic agendas.  She strips away the dogma intended to divide and conquer and shows that the message of Christ is enduring, true, and inspiring, irrespective of one's religion.  This is an important book.  While no one will ever adduce conclusive and irrefutable proof of Christ's life and teachings, Pagels gets darn close with arguments and supporting documentation that are  durable, persuasive, and sound.  A mind opener.	2003-08-10

That doesn't mitigate their guilt for hastening the information to our enemy.  The Rosenbergs weren't tried for what they believed.  They were tried for what they did.  And they were killed for what they did not do--which was recant.  Sworn communists, they chose death instead of life.  A selfish, stupid choice that placed a worthless ideology over the needs of their two young children, who have written worthwhile books about growing up as orphans of two of the most infamous American traitors.  This book ends the speculation that they were innocent, that they had no chance to save their lives by recanting.  Here are the latest facts and the fullest account of a chapter in American history that continues to be a vital flashpoint for people on either side of the political spectrum.	2003-06-21

He's a wonderful teacher.  Even hardcore taiji types--who often disagree on everything--seem unanimous:  Master Lam is the Real Deal.  The first volume he published, The Way of Energy, is probably the best book on QiGong I've read.  Doesn't mean there are aren't others as good, but based on what I've read, Way of Energy is tops.  Volume Two, The Way of Healing, is very good, but reiterates a lot of Volume One.  Now in Volume Three--Way of Power--Master Lam offers advanced QiGong exercises that were devised for fighters seeking to increase their power.  But a by-product of increased power is increased stamina, health, and sexual energy.  This book is highly recommended for anyone with a serious interest in qigong.  And if you're over forty, as I am (sigh), the by-products include an increase in sexual energy and vitality the likes of which remind me of being nineteen.  Forget the Viagra.  Get all three volumes and train.  (Just be careful not to waste your qi--a topic Master Lam doesn't cover in detail.  Check out Chia's Awaken Healing Energy or Daniel Reid's Tao of Health, Sex & Longevity.)	2003-05-25

It's like &quot;Any pose you can hold, I can hold better.&quot;  Worse, I've left class, or home practice, only to wait for the train or bus in a fit of impatience.  I've meditated only to find myself procrastinating over doing something that needs to be done--six months ago.  In short, I've practiced a lot of hatha yoga and meditation, and benefited from it, but there was no carry over into my life.  Which is what it's supposed to be about, not an end in itself.  And the Sutra's of Patanjali are nice, poetic semi-haikus but forget about applying them on the A train.  Here comes Iyengar veteran Lasater with a book on integrating yoga into everyday life so you don't leave it all on the sticky mat.  Every chapter deals with handling different emotional qualities, from developing courage to conquering fear and impatience.  Lasater gives examples from her life.  It's reassuring to read how an accomplished yogi and teacher struggles with the same issues.  And the yogic methods she's found to overcome them.  This book is an excellent complement to the standard books on the technique of yoga.  Don't let the title fool you.  This isn't a soft-headed New Age primer full of platitudes.  This is a how-to manual full of practical guidance.  So good it should come with a karma-back guarantee.	2003-05-22

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Never mind the house, bring down an editor	A gripping story told in prose redolent of Sidney Sheldon and Jacqueline Susanne, I enjoyed the book immensely but reading it gave me the feeling I get from bingeing at Mickey D's.  I fear that if Mezrich listed his favorite writers, they'd be the people banging out those books with shiny silver covers in the paperback rack at the airport.  At times the prose is so annoying it knocked me off track from the story, which is the book's strength.  Mezrich never met an adjective or adverb he didn't like.  Cliches abound, too.  \\"Kevin's heart thumped as he saw the roll of bills.\\"  \\"Then, suddenly, a bright glow erupted, first formless, then mushroom-shaped.  In a moment, the city became visible, the amazingly bright lights of downtown feeding into the long, radiant Strip and its mammoth hotels . . . the newly opened, sleek, dark glass Luxor Pyramid . . . the shimmering, emerald-green MGM . . . the Mirage, its bright red volcano spitting flames into the sky.\\"  The people in the book count cards to win money; someone should have counted Mezrich's modifiers and blue-penciled them out to make this a first-rate read.  Still, the story is so interesting the book is worthwhile.  Too bad that Mezrich makes flesh and blood people seem like ink and gel cartoons.  The book is a guilty pleasure, one you shouldn't deprive yourself of if the subject matter is the least bit interesting for you.	2003-05-13

The basics are explained with clarity.  Then Phil discusses the math, game theory, and strategy in various poker games with an emphasis on Hold 'Em, the most complex (most interesting) and most popular form of tournament and casino poker.  If you're already an Eagle (Phil classifies players according to type, such as the Mouse, the Elephant, the Jackal, etc.  Eagles are birds capable of feathering their nests with millions of dollars from poker) this would be an interesting book for the insight it provides into the mind of another certified Eagle.  If you're a beginner or intermediate with Eaglelike aspirations, this is the best primer around.  It's not the only book you'll need to read, but it will teach you the language and strategies of poker.  Then the manuals written for advanced players will make sense and you'll gain much more from them than if you just jumped in to one of them.  One caveat:  before you jump into a game for real money, finish the book.  Don't get fired up after a chapter or two and hit the poker room at the Bellagio expecting to clean up.  In poker, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  FINISH THE BOOK before you open your wallet.	2003-05-09

His memoir, which I understand is being made into a movie (Nicholas Cage reportedly wants to play Slim), should broaden his audience.  Slim's distinctive voice is in every sentence, and it's a voice that makes you want to listen forever.  One of the startling things that comes through, though Slim doesn't push it at all, is the fact that this man has an amazing mathematical mind (I'd bet his IQ is well north of &quot;Exceptional&quot;).  Coupled with an insight into people that would make Freud envious, Slim has all the right ingredients for a millionaire gambler who made his first million at nineteen--while serving a tour of duty in the Army.  This book could be required reading for the business crowd who gobble up books by CEOs and politicians.  Except you won't find palaver in here about corporate spirit, etc.  Slim is a lone wolf who chose, in his words, &quot;a hard way to make an easy living.&quot;  Henry Miller said that for him, reading I.B. Singer was &quot;like eating pie,&quot; pure pleasure that went down easy and made you want more.  That's what reading this memoir was like for me.  I have the attention span of a gnat, but once I started reading, I didn't want to do anything else.  When the book was over I wished I could have opened Volume Two.  The literati might treat this book with condescension, like it's a novelty item.  If gripping narrative, life lessons, laugh-out-loud humor and sheer honesty don't add up to literature, I want to stay clear of the Critics' Picks.  This is a memoir that conveys the entirety of the writer on every page, and it does it without a drop of pretension.  If you dislike gambling, this book might not be for you, but if you like gambling, or are indifferent to it but enjoy books that deal with business strategy and tactics, I think you'll like this a lot.  It made this New Yorker want to move to the Lone Star State, put on a tengallon hat, and make regular trips to Vegas for some action.	2003-05-08

Since virtually every dedicated player has read it, to play without reading it is to put yourself at a disadvantage.  Sklansky focuses on the math of poker--how to calculate odds, pot odds, reverse implied pot odds, etc.  It's not a fun read; it reminded me of some of the college textbooks I dreaded, but it rewards hard work with a new depth of insight that will make you a smarter, more insightful player.  It deserves five stars but I gave it four because it can be so dreary.  No colorful stories of how so-and-so went all in with a pair of fours only to [take out a set on the River, etc.  Sklansky is so professorial in tone it's hard to imagine him at smoky poker table betting the farm.  And in truth, he's more noted as a theoretician than a player.  But if you want to play poker for serious stakes, this book is required reading.	2003-05-05

McManus interweaves the story of the trial with the story of the tournament and the game itself.  Along the way he explores the more feral nooks and crannies of humankind.  I don't think I can do the book justice other than to say it's like Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil--only this is great writing from someone who was there.  A better comparison is with In Cold Blood, Capote's groundbreaker.  Positively Fifth Street is Cold Blood for the new millenium, a factual account that reads like a novel.  I don't care if you've never even played a hand of solitaire.  This book will take you by the throat and keep you reading and won't let go.  The book's ancestors, like Tony Holden's Big Deal and Alvarez's Biggest Game, are excellent.  But they never transcend the subject, nor do they try to.  McManus has hit on something so specific but so universal it's Shakespearean.  Literary journalism at its peak.	2003-04-21

Garner is leading what might be a Quixotic charge to make lawyers write clear, clean, unambiguous and even interesting prose.  This book is a recent addition to the Garner arsenal, which includes the excellent The Winning Brief and A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage.  The anonymous writer from New York who slams Garner is wrong.  He claims that traditional legal drafting has stood the test of time and is readily understood by judges, who ultimately have to interpret it.  If the writing were clear to begin with, the parties wouldn't get to a judge.  They'd likely settle.  And that writer ignores the fact that there are thousands, perhaps millions, of legal decisions over contract disputes, almost all arising from documents that were &quot;traditionally drafted.&quot;  And different judges can decide differently about the meaning of a clause.  That writer askes rhetorically whether Garner would insist that mathematicians use prose to make their work clear to laypeople.  The rhetoric ignores the fact that mathematics is its own language.  Legal writing is written in English, the same English used to buy groceries, talk lovingly to your spouse, and complain to the doctor about what ails you.  There is no valid reason a contract should be beyond the comprehension of a layperson, other than lawyers' need to feel like they're elevated professionals with a grip on arcana.  And the writer's praise of &quot;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary&quot; as an incantatory phrase in contracts overlooks an obvious improvement:  &quot;DESPITE anything in this agreement to the contrary . . . .&quot;  Garner is a brilliant, insightful teacher who cares deeply about the language and its highest and best use.  We know what happens with legalese:  litigation and contention and noncomprehension.  Give plain English a try, with Garner as your guide to Aquinas's trinity of wholeness, harmony, radiance, and of course clarity clarity clarity.	2003-03-31

A page turner, it reads like a sci fi thriller.  Words from a true spiritual giant.  Nevertheless, I agree with the reviewer who said this is not the best edition.  Self-Realization was founded by Yogananda and they reshaped the text somewhat to promote their organization.  But if this is the only edition you can get, buy it.  Whatever their faults, Self-Realization keeps the book affordable and in print.  One warning:  throughout the book Yogananda keeps talking about the marvelous technique of kriya yoga.  I kept waiting for him to explain how to do it.  He never does, referring interested readers to an authorized teacher.  I found that frustrating.  For readers who want to learn the technique, or at least variations of it, check out Paulen's SACRED SCIENCE.  Paulsen, a disciple of Yogananda, teaches the technique there.  For the Taoist approach to the technique, check out Chia's  AWAKEN HEALING ENERGY THROUGH THE TAO or Yang Jwing Ming's QIGONG FOR HEALTH AND MARTIAL ARTS.  All available from Amazon.	2003-03-30

Elkin is to writing what Cirque du Soleil is to entertainment.  If you like well-plotted books that will leave you with a moral or a memorable story, Elkin may not be for you.  If you like language for language's sake and appreciate sentences sculpted by a lingual Michelangelo and marvelous displays of craft, try this book.  Elkin is a limited writer and an acquired taste, but within his limitations he was the best.  I know of no other writer who could, for example, write a novel about terminally ill children (The Magic Kingdom) and make it funny and moving without ever getting anywhere near sentimentality or the kind of somber earnestness you'd expect.  If you like this book, try Magic Kingdom and also Criers and Kibbitzers, a short story collection of his.	2003-02-23

He offers insights of an inspirational, philosophic nature on writing.  He's interesting even when he rambles, and the book is full of aphorisms that are encouraging and incisive.  The book is worthwhile.  It's the thinking and advice of one of the Twentieth Century's literary masters about his field of expertise.  There's also plenty of advice about fields beyond his expertise, but Mailer eventually makes it all relevant to writing and, more important, to living the kind of life he feels necessary to produce great or very good writing.  Mailer is like a great coach in this book, inciting the reader to be braver, to work harder, to  want more, to cultivate appetite and a certain recklessness that is an antidote to what he calls the &quot;paranoid perfection&quot; imbued by writing programs.  I think Anne Lamott's Bird By Bird is a kinder, gentler counterbalance to Stormin' Norman's inspiring hectoring to step up to the plate--in life and in writing--and is also an excellent book on writing.  Where Lamott is compassionate, gentle, a chamomile tea-offering, hand-holding tutor, Mailer is a grizzled veteran exhorting us to throw ourselves into the mix, to take chances, to aspire to more than we may ever achieve.  Good advice from someone who's lived it, and produced some of the most influential writing of the last century.	2003-02-23

If you've never read him, this is probably the best of his late fiction.  Profane Friendship and Runaway Soul are all but unreadable.  This Wild Darkness, which was edited by his wife, possibly for intelligibility, is a fantastic memoir and meditation on living and dying.  I'd recommend, for a good blast of Brodkey the fiction writer, First Love and also Almost Classical Mode.  The former presentes lucid, moving, beautifully written stories.  The latter offers mandarin, inaccessible prose that seems to be trying to capture the mind as it oscillates from thought to thought, feeling to feeling.

Posner also examines the inconsistencies in Cardozo's thinking and opinion-writing.

There's nothing difficult to understand or apply.  But the material will probably change the way you practice.  It certainly did for me.  I've been practicing yoga, on and off, for about ten years.  I've taken classes with terrific teachers and even an agonizing series of 6 a.m. seminars with K. Pattabhi Jois.  Yoga never got beyond the physical for me until I read Schiffman's book.  Sometimes I wondered what the real difference was between a good hatha yogi and a contortionist.  That question has been answered.  Schiffman teaches the internals of yoga.  His focus is on mobilizing the body's intrinsic energy--qi or prana--in each posture.  The postures act as energy templates, he explains, but it's necessary to understand the lines of flow and circulation.  He makes this very easy to understand and apply.  And when you do, the external technique improves and you become precise without thinking about every distracting detail.  Also, Schiffman's approach is beautiful.  He teaches you to sense your limits and learn when you want to stay well within them, and when you want to push them.  This is a method of gentle, &quot;occasional healthy pain, tremendous gain.&quot;  Schiffman is schooled in the Iyengar and Desikachar approaches.  Precision is important to him.  But he's taken it a quantum step farther.  With Iyengar's Light on Yoga and Donna Farhi's Yoga Mind, Body &amp; Spirit, Schiffman's book completes a trinity of the three most impressive, helpful books on hatha yoga I've seen, regardless of which style you practice or your level of skill.	2003-02-03

James Mason, the suave evil boss, consoles her with a drink and an apothegm:  \\"You don't get paid to do your best,\\" Mason says.  \\"You get paid to win.\\"  That scene (expertly written by David Mamet) explains the legal profession in America and provides a summary of Kronman's argument. Kronman, the current Dean of Yale Law, bemoans the extinction of lawyers of sound judgment, prudence, and a concern for a range of interests--the client's, the law's, society's, etc.  Lawyers who were actively involved with their community and their country, who were looked to as figures of wisdom, not avarice.  But Kronman is more diagnostic than prescriptive.  He's right--that breed of lawyer has all but vanished.  Still, he provides little in the way of practical suggestions for correcting the problem.  And his focus is on the profession and the law schools.  His focus should be on the free market.  Elite American law schools are catering to the needs of the large firms, which are catering to the needs of their corporate clients.  To graduate marketable lawyers, the schools have to create skilled technicians.  The hiring partner at a Wall Street Firm wants to know that an applicant has the stamina necessary to put in the hours, and the intelligence and tools needed to grind out competent work.  No one is interested in his or her views about what might be a more prudent approach to the client's problem; his or her judgment is not only not demanded, it's unwelcome.  Kronman's focus is too narrow.  The legal profession has become the law business.  Because that's what's demanded by clients, who pay the tab.  So I think he should have examined the underpinnings of the free market system, which I favor but which is responsible for the shift in legal education and law practice.  Also, how does one teach prudence?  How does a vocational school--or perhaps any school--instil sound judgment?  Furthermore, prudence and judgment are qualities that, like beauty, are in the eye of the beholder.  Finally, Kronman's assertion that much of the problem arose when the large Protestant law firms started hiring Jews, African-Americans, women, and associates from the working classes and from second and third-tier schools sounds not only wrong, but bizarrely priggish and elitist in all the wrong ways.  Kronman, as far as I can tell, has never practiced law for any length of time, nor has he toiled as a judge.  He's spent his career locked in the Ivory Tower of academia, and his book is the high-toned result.	2002-12-20

A friend who studies tai chi told me about this book.  I've done some tai chi and was open to reading the material which, though not tai chi, concerns exercises for cultivating and regulating internal energy.  Particularly since tai chi is supposed to lower blood pressure, it made sense to check it out.  After two months of doing no other form of exercise but the standing exercise in this book--but doing it daily for up to thirty minutes at a time--my blood pressure dropped to 120/74.  My stress test rated the medical equivalent of an A+.  That was four years ago.  When I stop exercising from laziness, the b.p. creeps up.

This is Volume III of the Iron Shirt series.  As far as I know, there is no Volume II unless you count a videotape Chia produced.  Anyway, Volumes I and III belong in the library of any enthusiastic tai chi/chi gong practitioner.  But the techniques in these volumes are dangerous.  Read the books for the theory, learn what's been held back by teachers for hundreds of years, but do not try any of these exercises unless you are working one-on-one with a master teacher, preferably one with training in Asian medicine.  Chi packing is very dangerous and it forms a central part of the practices in Volume I.  Lifting weights with your genitals is equally dangerous, if not more so, and that's featured in Volume III.  Some chi gong teachers shun these practices entirely as unnecessary and unhealthy.  Others believe they are enormously beneficial if practiced correctly.  If the books pique your interest, find a great teacher and work with him or her on this stuff.  Otherwise, keep the barbells at the gym and the book for purely intellectual gratification.	2002-11-26

If you want to learn the technique of kriya yoga, you'll get a recipe for disappointment.  Schmidt doesn't teach technique at all.  He muses and rambles in a soft-headed, soft-hearted way, about a lot of New Age Old Hat amalgamated with quasi-Christian notions.  If you're a member of Schmidt's immediate family, by all means, buy it.  Otherwise, try The Sacred Science by Paulsen.	2002-11-19

Based on my experience, and on the unanimous opinions of some high-level tai chi teachers, Lam is the Real Deal. The book's practices are safe and potent. They work as a kind of general tonic, curing what ails you, infusing energy, strength and vitality. Nothing here is complicated or subject to misunderstanding. Lam's book is clear and the exercises are almost impossible to do incorrectly. Whether you want improved health, energy, vitality, sexual stamina and desire, fighting skill or all of the above, The Way of Energy belongs in your hands.	2002-11-18

Carpender is not a physician, just a person with a weight problem, a solution to it, and scads of practical advice.  Unlike the various M.D.'s who've written low-carb diet books, Carpender has no axes to grind, no &quot;my diet is better than their diet&quot; crankiness.  She reviews the leading low-carb diets and opines on each, basing her conclusions on her and her friends' experiences.  Evenhanded and clear, Carpender offers a synopsis of each diet so the reader can try them all and select the one that proves most beneficial.  I felt like I was reading the unbiased, untendentious prose of a charming person who would get me closer to the truth of low carb dieting--and get me fitting back into those bespoke suits a client made for me thirty-five pounds ago.  So far, Carpender's advice has been right on the money.  Buy the other low carb books if you like, but be sure to buy this one first.  It's fun to read and the information can make you healthy, fit, and slender.	2002-10-21

I bought this book, \\"The Spiritual Science...\\" hoping the technique would be explained. It isn't. He explains pretty much everything else in Yoga, and does so quite well; the book is a good compendium of techniques. But the actual Kriya technique is only taught if you go visit his ashram in Chicago, according to a wispy-voiced woman I spoke to there. If you want to learn a straight version of the actual Kriya technique, buy The Sacred Science by Norman Paulsen. He's thrown in a lot of Christian theory and jargon, but the technique itself is what he learned from Yogananda, and he gives it to you in a clear and practical form. However, keep in mind that there is some controversy about whether the version of the Kriya technique that SRF teaches, as taught by Yogananda, was simplified for a western audience. Having learned another version of the technique from followers of Swami Hariharananda, and having read the SRF version, I can say only that the version I was taught seems more complete. The key difference being that, in the SRF version, in the core exercise the energy and breath are moved up and down the spine, as if the spine were a straw. In the version I learned, the breath is moved up the spine, around the top of the head where it passes through the crown chakra, and then down the front of the body, chakra by chakra, and up and around again and again, with other steps following the basic pranayama, and preceding it. Now, I cannot say whether one is more effective in inducing meditation, stilling the mind, raising the kundalini, fostering spiritual growth, and I suspect that it might be an individual thing. But the reader should understand that when one says \\"kriya yoga,\\" the techniques differ considerably, with the guru who claims to be teaching Babaji's kriya yoga teaching still another variation that is quite dissimilar from what I have described. This of course leads to controversy: which is authentic? My advice: read as much as you can, then find a teacher with a solid lineage and learn that version of the technique first hand. While I have had an excellent experience with the Hariharananda group, I'm sure there are other teachers, including the SRF and those who studied there and started their own schools, as well as the author of this book. Meanwhile, practice what you read and see if it helps your meditation.hould understand that when one says \\"kriya yoga,\\" the techniques differ considerably, with the guru who claims to be teaching Babaji's kriya yoga teaching still another variation that is quite dissimilar from what I have described.

Sometimes he's so good with syntax and diction he can make you swoon.  But if there's a heart beating under all that icy, finely machined prose, it's hard to discern.  And so the problem with Underworld is that it's a bit like spending weeks hugging a glacier.  Humor, insights, compelling characters are supplanted by DeLillo's way with words.  Language for language's sake.  Language is the real character and concern of the novel, and finishing it bestows a sense of accomplishment, as if one scored a personal tour de force nearly as laudable as writing it.  But it likely won't leave you changed in any measurable way.  Diction and irony are fine, but not at this length.  Underworld seems to have a message.  If it only had a heart.	2002-08-09

The late-Roth triple-header of Human Stain, American Pastoral, I Married A Communist or(even better than Communist, Sabbath's Theater) has assured him a place in history untainted by the sensationalism that accompanied Portnoy's Complaint, the book that got the public to take notice, the rabbis to denounce, and the media to enshrine Roth in fame/notoriety.  Portnoy's Complaint, however, is a book with perfect pitch.  The humor and volcanic energy of an Elkin is combined with sheer readibility, accessibility, and the stench of a psyche spraying the page with candor.  This is a great book.  Unlabored, unforgettable, and true.	2002-07-21

This book does nothing to undermine that hypothesis.  Rabbi Kaplan, arguably the most prolific, cogent, and accessible of writers on Jewish esoterica and mysticism, explores how the Torah's Prophets used meditation as a tool to foster their prescience.  The book also serves as an incisive gloss on aspects of the Torah, explicating the esoteric meaning underlying various elements of it.  The section on Psalm 119 alone is worth the price of the book.  Kaplan's objective in all of his works is to get at the heart of Judaism, to use the form to understand the substance.  Meditation and The Bible is an important part of his oeuvre.  Irrespective of one's religion, this book instils the sense that the reader is being let in on secrets of The Bible previously unknown to all except true Initiates, whoever they might be.  Add it to your Kaplan collection.  If you don't have a collection of his other books, this should inspire you to start one.	2002-07-21

Berger, whose contributions to humankind and Judaism are slim at best, decided to make his mark in the time-honored tradition of knocking his betters, in this case, Rebbe Schneerson, one of the greatest sages, spiritual leaders and rabbis.  Berger's arguments are obsolete.  They were eviscerated back in the 1800's when Chassidism began to take hold.  His complaints could be directed to virtually any Chassidic sect, but he chose Chabad largely because it is likely the most visible Chassidic group in this country.  Maybe what Berger sees as Orthodox indifference is actually Orthodox wisdom and insight, traits Berger lacks.  I'm pleased to say I found a copy of this book in a stack of discarded books and magazines on the sidewalk near my apartment.  Had I paid to read this I would have been embarassed.  If you plan to purchase this book, take the money and give it to charity, spend it on ice cream, go to a movie, or throw it out the window, but find a better way to waste it.	2002-06-27

The detail and liberal use of Hebrew can be intimidating, particularly if you're a \\"new Jew\\" like me--a baal t'shuvah.  For those of you seeking a more elementary text, I highly recommend Steinsalt's book on prayer, Reuven Hammer's \\"Entering Jewish Prayer,\\" and Donin's \\"To Pray As a Jew.\\"  But this book belongs on your shelf.  It can be skimmed, read closely, or consulted for in-depth analyses.  It will be there waiting for you (and, baruch Hashem) for me when the day comes that I'll be able fully to appreciate and apprehend it.  I may not understand the book in its entirety, but I know a masterpiece when I see one.	2002-04-04

No self-willed stylistic twitchings, no self-conscious twisting and burnishing of sentences or opacity.  Pure brilliance, sentence by sentence and, more important, story by story, is what the collection comprises.  Somehow, Singer writes page turners that gratify the heart as much as the head.  Even if you're a fan of post-modern ironists, take a look at these stories.  You'll probably love them.  And you don't have to have a working knowledge or, or interest in, Judaism.  Beware, however.  Disaffection for this collection is a strong indication of a mind in search of a soul.	2002-03-19

Beautifully, sparely written by the son of writers Edna O'Brien and Ernest Gebler, this memoir is an engrossing account of life with a cold, emotionally brutal father who, post-divorce, does his best to set the kids against their infinitely more loving, kind and (much to her ex-husband's despair) successful mom.  Gebler's father is less deliberately cruel than blind to his shortcomings as a father and a human being.  Still, his ignorance doesn't stop the reader from despising him until, by the book's end, the same transformation of consciousness the author underwent takes hold in the reader.  Pity replaces contempt, as we grow along with Gebler into someone who comes to understand, and even forgive, the unforgivable.  All of it rendered in a lean and quick prose that's flawless but never showy.  Far and away the best of the current crop of memoirs.	2002-01-28

They're not kidding when they call it the ultimate review.  But if you're a solid intermediate in the language and want to freshen your chops, you won't do much better than this title.  The material is clear, with exercises that boost your communication skills (unlike the stilted palaver I was force fed in my first few years of French--e.g., &quot;J'ai un crayon.  Mon crayon est jeune.&quot;  Very useful in conversation.) And the authors include contemporary advertisements and brief articles to get you used to the language as it is actually used today.  On the other hand, if you are a beginner, and have the money, buy the Comprehensive Pimsleur French tapes (cher, mais excellent) and this book.  The only other thing you'll need is France.	2002-01-10

In clear photographs explicated by easily followed instructions, Alfred Huang's book makes it possible to learn this tai chi form on your own.  If you're already familiar with any style of tai chi, your progress will be  rapid, as you'll already understand subtleties of weight shifting,  breathing and alignment that are nearly impossible to fully convey in cold  print.  Whatever your background, the effort is worth it.  This version of  the Wu style instills a soft, buoyant energy; you can feel your body being  healed and strengthened as you run through the movements.  There are  relatively few books around on this style.   Although a little weak on  illustrating certain transitions, COMPLETE TAI CHI is one of the best, and  Huang's teaching is saturated with authenticity.  He knows his stuff and  teaches it beautifully.	1999-03-04
