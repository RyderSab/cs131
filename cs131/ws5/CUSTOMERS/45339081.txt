Books	5	36	37	N	N	The Season's Smartest Gift/Toy/Book/Game	Reviewed by Carolyn Howard-Johnson, award-winning author of This is the Place, Harkening: A Collection of Stories Remembered and The Frugal Book Promoter and a chapbook of poetry called Tracings<br /><br />This may be the most colorful, most useful, most fun little 10 x 10 cube a parent will ever run across. The Cranium Big Book of Outrageous Fun may also be the best 20 bucks they ever spent. It terms of entertainment. In terms of education. If I still had elementary kids living at home, I'd buy a half dozen or so of them and keep them on a closet shelf as a year's supply of birthday and Christmas gifts!<br /><br />As a former teacher, I have always had a thing about education being fun. I also believe that children should think so, too. Ideally, they should be having so much fun at learning they won't know that they are being educated. This is the item that will do it. Billed as \\"The Write-it, Draw-it, Sculpt-it, Act-it Game-in-a-Book-in-a-Game,\\" it includes a great guidebook full of fun stuff like maps and fascinating tidbits all beautifully put together with color tabs and great illustrations by Baseman. It also includes \\"Cranium Clay\\" for sculpting, a miniature hourglass timer, game cards, a spinner (that you can see through a cutout on the front of the box), an erasable marker, game pieces and game board and a marker in this toy/book's fave color, purple. How the publisher, LB Kids, stuffed all this into one box is part of the fun.<br /><br />Cranium is suggested for kids seven and up. I'd say way up. It's been awhile since I did homework with kids. Some of this information was very good review for me, too. And there is no age limit on creativity.	2005-09-01

I could describe In the Shadow of Suribachi by Joyce Faulkner with wordslike \\"heartfelt, consummate skill, emotional and bloody,\\" fool a bit with the caesuras and stresses and--perhaps--give readers a better sense of the soul of the book.<br /><br />Having said that, there is more to this work than its essence and prose will work better to explain that. Here the author assembles disparate events like the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane in Islmorada, Fl, the infamous kristallnacht, the 1942 circus fire in Cleveland. Each real-life event is told from the point of view of a character and may--at first--feel as if they are separate stories. If the reader listens carefully, however, she will hear the intimations in each of how these young men's futures will connect, how what has gone before will affect them later as Marines fighting and suffering in Iwo Jima in 1945.<br /><br />This book is neither beast nor fowl. The stories (and story) are based on interviews and careful research so it is nonfiction. They are told with all the craft of a fiction writer; that makes it creative nonfiction. They are assembled in a way that would qualify it as a literary novel. A literary novel, after all, tells of the human condition. Characters in literary novels must be carefully drawn and readers should draw something from one that lives long after the last page is turned. This book, published by a new traditional press called the Red Engine Press, qualifies.<br /><br />Readers should know that, though they may well be mesmerized by this story (stories), it is not easy reading. Endorsed by professionals from the Army's 101st Airborne Division to history teachers, it captures what Lt. Col. Dave Grossman calls \\"the reality of human aggression and combat.\\" This is a time when we, as a nation, need to fully understand what we are sending our young men and women to do.

I read it so long ago that I had to look up the author's name.  Perhaps when I read it I was not yet in the habit of paying attention to the names of authors. Back in the third grade I thought what folly it was to be required to memorize one more inconsequential fact when a teacher insisted that the writer's name be included in a book review.<br /><br />  I also remember loving the Cinderella quality of this little girl-protagonist's life (and girl-protagonists were not so easy to find in those days--NANCY DREW  and LITTLE WOMEN are about the only ones that come to mind but there must have been others!)<br /><br />  Never-the-less, the garden itself was the star for me. I still think of bulbs--I seem to remember they were tulip bulbs--as magical because of this novel.<br /><br />  My mother remembered SECRET GARDEN from when she was a child (she is now 87) and \\"swiped\\" it from me when I brought it home.  Perhaps that I was deprived of it for days until she finished makes it all the more memorable for me.  At any rate, I plan to read it this summer.

Reviewed by Carolyn Howard-Johnson, award-winning author of This is the Place, Harkening: A Collection of Stories Remembered and The Frugal Book Promoter.<br /><br />This is a book that cares. Todd Parr and his publisher, the Little Brown for Young Readers division of LB Company, have introduced a book that supports the work of a wonderful literacy organization, Reach Out and Read. They've done it with Reading Makes You Feel Good, an imaginative book that explores how reading can empower a child--can empower anyone, for that matter.<br /><br />The illustrations are in Crayola colors and remind me of the bright little cut-out puzzles from Europe made with wood. You know, good Danish or Swedish design. Each picture-page includes not only the story narrative but pictures of things with words in them. That association between words and how they can label objects is a subtle message for toddlers and beginning readers.<br /><br />The only advantage for reading that Parr misses in this simple but well-written story is that reading prepares one for writing better, for writing other books like Parr's that will help children learn, writing reviews like this that will help parents pick the very best of books for their children!<br /><br />-------<br /><br />(Carolyn Howard-Johnson's first literary novel, This is the Place, has won eight awards and Harkening, a collection of stories, has won three.

Here we have a man whose life's work has been instrumental in the quest for a cure for AIDS, whose roots in Jamaica have permeated many parts of the world, who has experienced celebrity--of his own and of those whose elbows he has rubbed.

It is a chronicle that parallels that of The Great Depression, World War II, the growth of the film industry and Los Angeles itself. We meet again celebrities we haven't thought about in years like the adorable dimpled Jon Davison, the memorable Vincent Price and even run across pop culture icons like Frank Gorshin.<br />Occasionally this book is burdened with glitz-town detail that only a dedicated film buff might adore but these moments are rare. Like a super hero, Corman--now 75 and still going--is resilient because he is multi-faceted. The same can be said for screenwriter cum UCLA instructor and journalist Beverly Gray. The two seem admirably paired in that way. Gray uses her many experiences and talents to tell the story of a man of many parts.<br />(...)	2004-06-07

She was interviewed in Time Magazine; in it she explained the title this way:<br />&quot;I went to a college reunion. It was an all-women's college, and we were all in our 30s. We were in that high-stress zone. We were trying to make it in the workplace; we were making it in our marriages; we had small children. We were just torn apart by the demands of our lives. We were trying to make everything work. I remember one classmate stood up and wailed...&quot;When is it going to be my time?&quot; That stuck with me.<br />The important thing here is that aging and its benefits are being recognized and becoming desirable. This is especially important for women who have historically dreaded the first wrinkle.  Hoo Ray for Trafford!<br />--------<br />Reviewed by Carolyn Howard-Johnson, award-winning author of THIS IS THE PLACE and HARKENING.

But more about that later.<br />Near and dear to my heart is that the protagonist and narrator, Ginger Wannamaker, has grandparents who are anything but the kind of stereotypes that should have disappeared from literature(but didn't) in the 70s. Her grandfather whizzes around southern Indiana in his carefully groomed MG and her grandmother-though she is frequently seen preparing delicious breakfast-- does so to the beat of rock `n' roll.<br /><br />It also approaches fiction with the curiosity-no pun intended-of a child. Once a youngster has been introduced to a subject-wire haired terriers, as an example, or buffalo nickles-she wants to know more about them. This book provides a fascinating nonfiction element about those things in a kind of index that entertains called \\"Learning More.\\" It even includes adorable pictures of the author's real life and oh-so-perky dog, Laird.<br />Mostly, however, this story is an adventure complete with spooky old homes, secret passages and part of America's history come alive. If a grade school child has lots of \\"Curiosity,\\" she'll enjoy reading this book herself. Younger children will learn from it, too, if their older siblings will only read it to them.	2004-04-19

Like a good rubdown refreshes cranky old bones, such a habit will rejuvenate perspective and technique. For beginners it will work like essential balm, teach what even careful reading sometimes fails to disclose.<br />The reason that I am so sure of this is that I had occasion to spruce up an excerpt from my first novel This is the Place. Connie Gotsch, host of a literary program on KSJE, a radio station that caters to classical music lovers in the four corners area, asked me to read from both my books. It reminded me of the days when the whole world tuned into drama a la The Haunting Hour and Fibber McGee and Molly.I decided the chapter should be trimmed so it would entertain in the same way that these programs had in the Golden Age of Radio.<br />I had just read Writing Dialogue and was surprised at how many changes I made in my already published dialogue as I was trimming the except. Before reading it, I was convinced that it wouldn't teach me much. I've studied long and hard, done my homework. That turned out to be hubris. The changes I made were subtle to be sure, a kind of tweaking that would not have been possible without Chiarella's insight.<br />Chiarella covers everything from grammar and  the punctuation of dialogue to listening. He is most valuable, however, when he dissects dialogue and paints pictures of whole new ways to hear it, then to write it. He even includes tips like having characters interrupt themselves, back up and repeat and suggests ways this can be used to better characterization.<br />Writers should not borrow this book from the library. It will be better read, dog tagged, underlined and sitting on their desks where they can reach for a kind of writing-massage on a moment's notice.<br /><br />(Carolyn Howard-Johnson will teach at UCLA's Writers' Program in the fall of 2004.

Stucki is an M.D. Even with that background, he acknowledges another physician who helped him with questions of internal medicine. Naturally, I trusted his science; I learned to trust his keen sense for character when I read his first book, BOY'S POND, so I expected no less from this one.<br />That this novel is set in southern Utah takes it out of the realm of mysteries set in more traveled, better-known spots. The \\"foreignness\\" of the place and its people are rare occurances in literature. Many novels set in Utah are not written by natives but have been researched--dare I say sparsely?  It is a state dominated by a much misunderstood culture. Most know the area is beautiful (red, iron rich plateaux, wind swapt canyons reminiscent of the Grand Canyon, volcanic action aplenty)  but relatively few have sampled it to any great extent. HUNTING FOR HIPPOCRATES may give a reader a taste for learning still more about it.<br />(Carolyn Howard-Johnson's first novel, This is the Place, has won eight awards.

It is even more important that each faced down a challenge that could possibly be our own story.  Disease.  A stroke of bad luck.  The fact that our culture still has double standards for women.<br />Gloria Killian served sixteen years in prison for a crime she did not commit.  Her story is one of my favorites partially because it is about one woman helping another.  Joyce Rider heard of her plight and with the aid of the congregation of All Saints Church in Pasadena fought the state for Gloria's freedom.  Gloria was released in August 2002 and  devotes her time to helping convicted women fight for justice.<br />Although each of the twelve women Powers chose to feature in Paths (some well-known, some next-door-neighbor types)  has survived extreme adversity, each story is uplifting. Each learned from her personal challenges.  Each successfully learned to follow her dream.<br />It is my belief than anyone who chooses to learn from the success stories of these women will benefit.  They will find in these pages compassion, understanding and, yes, even fear. Fear will come from the realization that the rich and easy lives we live may only be temporary and that, to succeed, we each must find our own strength and our own path.

At the same time, what fun all this stuff is!  My grandson calls anything spooky \\"oooo-eee, oooheee\\" and likens it all to Stephen King.<br />Now he may have a new author connection.  James Crowley has written a novel about the mysterious bond shared by identical twins.  The acknowledgement of this extraordinary link and ability to communicate without verbalizing has been recognized and admired through virtually all cultures through all times, is perhaps even older than our Halloween traditions that go back at least to the Celts and maybe beyond.  The Magic Hour explores the possibility that this bond between birth mates may remain unbroken even in death.<br /> Crowley presents a compelling story of a nine-year-old boy who discovers he can still communicate with his identical twin even after his brother has passed away. This same young boy learns of the ancient practices surrounding the Halloween tradition and embarks on a quest  to find out if the spirits of the deceased really do return to visit their loved ones on the night of All Hallow's Eve.<br /> The author draws upon various ancient beliefs, superstitions and folk tales to give this work depth and texture.  He has adapted the old northern European folk tale The Erlking for the 21st Century.  It casts a broad shadow of fear over the young minds in the story and serves as a catalyst for key plot turns.<br />As Dickensesque as this book is, it is much more than a mere moral fable.  Crowley weaves the themes of love--brother, parental, romantic--together, embroiders these with his own illustrations and they become a work of imagination with, Boo!  an unexpected ending...	2003-10-14

That poetry has been a theme for so many makes approaching the subject very tough indeed.<br />No matter.  Reed succeeds in bringing us, certainly, lovely poems on many subjects but her success was most vivid for me when she attempted to compete with all those who have sung about poetry in the past.  Starting on Page 17 she begins with a mini-essay on poetry (little rills of prose on different subjects are liberally sprinkled throughout the book) and then includes a poem where she wishes for a &quot;poetry spray-gun.&quot;  Don't we all?  Even if we write fiction?  Even if we are readers only?  We curl up with a book in our hands to feel the weight, smell the ink and we hope for an unforgettable image.<br />Reed builds other bridges for the reader as well. She is at her best when she puts her poet's brain to struggle, including widowhood and addiction. Her excellence also blooms when she is in a nostalgic mood.  Truly a builder of bridges, this one!<br />--------<br />(Carolyn Howard-Johnson's first novel, This is the Place, has won eight awards.

That includes The Princess Diaries, Maid in Manhattan and other Cinderella stories that pretend to have an up-to-date twist for the modern woman. We have fashion designers exploiting women's desire for the glass slipper with five inch heels that will trash her posture and disintegrate her spine. Now we have The Princess Principle but it is not part of a trend toward exploitation.<br />Instead it is full of essays by eighteen women who share their hope, joy and expertise. The title may attract the very woman who needs it. It is an authentic inducement because our culture has made the idea of being a princess a part of our psyches that we might as well turn to our advantage.<br />The editors, Jana L. High and Marilyn Sprague-Smith, M. Ed., have assembled literate, well educated women with different stories and different angles on how we might improve ourselves and still live with-even accept-what now may appear to be our natural urge to be a princess. For these women, The Princess Principle isn't about being rescued; they know we are beautiful and important in the ways that count.<br />As a writer considering my own anthology I must also comment on the format of this book. It is rare among anthologies. It gives each contributor full and complete billing including her name on the front cover, her picture on the back. It is also careful to credential each author so the reader has a sense for who each of them is and how she might best approach that writer's views.<br />This book  might even be a resource for readers because some of the authors act as coaches, therapists, or advisors in real life.<br />In the spirit of this exceptional format here are the contributors:<br />Lorri Allen<br />Sue Bergstrom M.Ed.<br />Julie D.

Books	5	2	2	N	N	Move Over Judy Blume	Reviewed by Carolyn Howard-Johnson, award-winning author of This is the Place and Harkening: A Collection of Stories Remembered<br />  So many Christian writers get so caught up in espousing good, old-fashioned values that they forget that fiction is about story-telling. The author of &quot;If I'd Only Known...&quot;, Edee Wilcox, is not one of those writers.<br /> At first it is not evident that his book was written for a Christian audience, or, perhaps, for a lapsed Christian audience. Religion doesn't seem to be an issue for the protagonist, a 10th grader with popularity on her side but little self-confidence to go with it. Her problems do not seem to be earth-shaking, but the usual 15-year-old stuff; she and her mother tend to fall into patterns quite prevalent in today's culture. Disaster, of course, is the result and, in the tradition of Judy Blume, Wilcox does not shirk from describing the results of these failings honestly.<br /> That our heroine gets off lightly bothers me. &quot;If I'd Only Known...&quot; would have benefited from a parallel story about a young girl who was not so lucky, perhaps one whose parents were not open to honest communication and who suffers for it. Still, this book is a page-turner, one that most parents would want their daughters to read. It is also one that a young girl will enjoy reading. That is a battle hard-won in its genre and gratefully so.<br /><br />(Carolyn Howard-Johnson's coming-of-age story, This is the Place, has won eight awards.

It is a bit mystery, a bit futurist, a bit literary, a bit fantasy, a bit mainstream, a bit historical, a bit contemporary and a lot compelling. The story lines are woven like threads in a tapestry; they intersect one another in imaginative ways.<br />Each story is told from the character's own point of view, carefully labeled and dated. Some of these \\"chapters\\" are only a few paragraphs long, some much longer, but all leave the reader wanting-needing--to learn more, to turn those pages as fast as she can.<br />This book is for the mystical, the political, the literary, and even the fantasy-lovers among us. There is no way that a reader will turn that last page and think &quot;Mysticus&quot; is like anything else she's read. It is daring and original. Randall Silvis takes chances with his writing and the result is exquisite-palpable and yes, mystical.<br />(Carolyn Howard-Johnson's first novel, This is the Place, has won eight awards.

It is the darling of the big time reviewers, as well it should be.  Still, I think that readers ought to be warned.  It seems to be misbilled, as it were; that may be why I was tempted to shelve it before I became entranced.  I want my gentle readers to resist the urge.  That's why I'm mentioning this petty little annoyance in the face of what some are calling a work of art.<br />  Life of Pi is a combination of Kon Tiki, (Remember Thor Heyerdahl?), Moby Dick and The Old Man and the Sea.  A fine tradition to be sure.  It is well written but I just couldn't get a handle on point of view right away.  Nor could I immediately discern whether this book was, in fact, a novel as the cover proclaims, or a creative biography, a memoir or...Well, you get the idea.<br />  Hang in there. Once Pi, our hero, is on a lifeboat with a tiger, you won't care what kind of book this is, whether the tiger is a symbol or real.  You'll just want to be there for the ride, be there for the amazement.  Still, I don't advise you to skip those first 70 pages.

She's right, of course.Because we memorize the alphabet when we are young, we think we are naturally alphabetical animals. We are wrong. We had to learn specific skills for using a dictionary or putting a Rolodex into order, but we group and classify the entire world rather naturally.<br />I found that one of the most useful ways use Kipfer's combination dictionary and thesaurus is look up a word in my old thesaurus and then cross-reference what I found there to this new one.  If you look up &quot;receding&quot; in a thesaurus and find &quot;retrogression,&quot; you could go to Kipfer's book and find other entries that were, indeed, in your thesaurus, but you'll also find &quot;crablike.&quot;  That certainly suggests a simile better than another Latinate word like &quot;reflex&quot; or &quot;retrograde.&quot;<br />I also was in awe of Kipfer's approach to categorizing in her addendum.  She calls it a &quot;Quick Word Finder&quot;.  It uses very broad categories like Appealing-Unappealing. There one finds everything from the mundane (affluent, alluring, yummy) to the really off-beat (fiddle-footed and Circean.)<br /> (Carolyn Howard-Johnson's first novel, This is the Place, has won eight awards.

Reviewed by Carolyn Howard-Johnson, award-winning author of This is the Place and Harkening: A Collection of Stories Remembered<br /><br />Writer's Online Marketplace is one of the few review copies I have that will stay on my desk within easy reach.<br /><br />Debbie Ridpath Ohi has compiled a book of informative articles-sage advice from other writers--to go with a section of very complete Market Listings, all paying!  It covers everything from the very basics to \\"Insider Views.\\"  It even has a section that addresses \\"Online Promotion,\\" my favorite subject.  Its strength, however, is that list of more than 300 sites that pay their authors and the advice it gives on how to trace down sites that have changed addresses.<br /><br />Each entry in Online Marketplace is very complete; that is a boon to writers looking for new markets because it curtails the amount of research they must do for themselves. Because the entries are so complete, the book would benefit from some easily spotted codes or icons at the beginning of each listing.  Perhaps we can look forward to that in the next edition.  I'm sure there will be one.  Authors will want to keep on top of this rapidly changing market in yearly editions.<br />----<br />The reviewer is the author of the HowToDoItFrugally series of books for writers.	2003-06-16

Jaimie Hall and Alice Zyetz have arrived.<br /> They've edited a collection of essays called &quot;RV Traveling Tales: Women's Journeys on the Opne Road&quot; that will appeal to anyone who knows--deep down in--that women are sisters and should help one another to a more fulfilling life.  I liked \\"City Girl Takes a Hike\\" by Cathi Tessler.  It convinced me that traveling in an RV is not necessarily for someone else, someone less citified, someone less prissy.  After all, who wouldn't like the change from \\"waking up to the incessant ringing of the alarm at 4:45\\" to \\"waking up to...birdsong.\\"<br /><br /> The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Americans will be staying closer to home this year than in the past.  That may mean more RV travel.  That may mean all those Americans will be reading RV Traveling Tales.  Let's hear it for Thelma and Louise and Jaimie and Alice!  They've done their part to convince women to strike out in any direction that beckons to them!<br /><br /> (Carolyn Howard-Johnson's first novel, This is the Place, has won eight awards.

Having published many articles in the national and local media, I was afraid I wouldn't find a good one, that I would be too tough a critic.<br />Now I'll have to eat my fears.  If that is similar to eating crow, so be it.  Having published more than 2500 articles herself, Kawa-Jump's book is thorough and knowledgeable. It's also both basic enough for beginners and advanced enough to be a good review for accomplished writers.  Seasoned article writers might even find a new tidbit or two that will help them with marketing, with their contracts or with building their careers.<br />What I liked best about HTPYA is that it gives a mini insider's view of how an article reaches a publication's desk and it does it for categories from large consumer magazines to e-outlets.<br />I was surprised that the chapter I found the most rewarding was all about goals.  Obviously, my retailers who choose to pursue writing articles in their area of expertise are going to have to narrow their goals very drastically.  If it will work for someone with such a strict objective, it's sure to do even more for writers with big dreams.<br />  --------<br />(Carolyn Howard-Johnson's first novel, This is the Place, has won eight awards.

We are shocked, disgusted, and appalled.<br /><br />Honor Lost is a memoir, a first person account of just one of those legalized murders in Jordan.  Author Norma Khouri lived through the horror of seeing her best friend-a part of her heart, soul and life-cut down in her prime by her own family.  That is an amazing story but there is another.  Ms. Khouri escaped to the West to tell about it.<br />Jordan, a democratic country where such heinous crimes are not only disregarded but encouraged, is led by royalty that opposes these deeply-rooted customs but is powerless to make a difference. Efforts by the UN and humanitarian agencies have also been ineffective.  This author hopes to achieve what they can't with the power of her pen.<br />She tells her story and that of her beloved friend clearly and dramatically. Although the prose is not faultless, the story is as riveting as a finely wrought novel, the language simple and honest.  Khouri includes an afterword that explains the tribal beliefs and politics that foster this horrendous outcome of intolerance, along with short descriptions of similar documented cases from her country. She tells us that the practice is not declining but growing.  Her book ends with a section titled &quot;Farewell&quot; that seethes with the melancholy experienced by those who have no home.<br /><br />The book does not include a section offering steps that each of us might take to begin to mitigate these crimes against humanity. I know they exist.  Perhaps this information will be addended in the next edition.  Perhaps it could be placed on her publisher's Website along with the excerpt they provide.  Concrete suggestions would be the brilliant cut diamonds in the crown of Ms. Khouri's cause.<br /><br />(Carolyn Howard-Johnson's first novel, This is the Place, has won eight awards.<br />Her newly released Harkening: A Collection of Stories Remember has won three.<br />Both are about loving a home one cannot easily live in.)eleased Harkening: A Collection of Stories Remember has won three.<BR>Both are about loving a home one cannot easily live in.)	2003-05-16

She has been there, done that. She is an ideal guide through what is often a limbo of survival by hook or crook because she has a sense of humor.<br />  Marcell teaches by example.  With a light heart she tells of her own experiences with an aging father and with a system that can be far more exasperating than dealing with her difficult father.  The light heart did not come easily.  Because of the hard-earned know-how Marcell shares in \\"Elder Rage,\\" the process will be much easier for you.<br />  This book has been endorsed by many self-help gurus including John Bradshaw and Bernie Siegel.  It has a succinct and well-written addendum on treating dementia by Rodman Shankle, MS, MD.  He is the former medical direct of the University of California at Irvine's Alzheimer's Center.<br />  Occasionally Marcell lapses into lingo that may be too hip for some; because of that, it might not be understood by some of those in-between generations who aren't suffering from Alzheimer's (yet!), but mostly the humor comes through loud and clear and does exactly what it should do.<br />Pain and love are often inextricably intertwined; following Marcell's story is like reading any good memoir.

That Littlefair's predictions for that country and the world might actually come true makes this story fascinating and devastating.<br />Ty Campbell is a geologist who has finagled his way into being paid by an obscure US government agency to live with the silent rocks and aquifers in the heart of eastern Africa.  The opening chapters tell of the isolation, quiet and mineral deposits he loves are exquisite. They are a mind-numbing contrast to the bedlam that is about to engulf the world with tentacles so pervasive they reach out even to Campbell's self-imposed isolation in the desert.  There are some restrained romantic interests.  He comes to know several women of substance who personify the different ways that people might try to make a positive difference in the world.  He comes to know some men who are doing their best to undermine world order.  He learns a lot in the process.<br />Littlefair's imaginary (I sometimes wonder if it isn't more clairvoyant than fictional) world is, at times, difficult to follow.  The ins and outs and ups and downs of politics, the underworld, and the human traffickers aren't immediately clear.  This book is about international intrigue and I'm not sure it wouldn't lose something if the reader stopped to trace every intricacy.  Further, I don't feel it is necessary to catch every relationship and motivation to understand and to love a story..  I thought this one was well worth the ride.<br />--------<br />(Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"	2003-01-09

It is the outcome of the author's living in a Bedouin community in northern Egypt (the Western Desert) for two years, a feat of no mean proportions.<br /> Lila Abu-Lughod came to a deep understanding of such aspects of the culture as blood ties, veiling and poetry not only because of her talent and training but also because she has ties to that culture. She calls academics like herself \\"halfies\\" because they belong both \\"inside and outside the communities they write about.\\" She realizes that such a situation benefits them in terms of gathering knowledge within close cultures.<br /> The veiling of women (or rather women's veiling of themselves) is an important topic because of recent events including world politics and of the ongoing research in feminism.  It is also important because it is so often misunderstood and so difficult to understand even when it is explained.<br /><br /> After reading Abu-Lughod's renowned (in the world of academics) book, \\"Veiled Sentiments,\\" I think I have a better handle on veiling than I ever would have had otherwise.  It was not easy to absorb the concepts that surround it.  That it took ¼ of a 315 page book to do it (a conservative estimate) is a testament to the intricacies of and the psychological motivations behind this cultural /religious practice.<br /> Learning more about veiling alone made this study one well worth reading.  But the surprise for both the reader, and-as explained by Ms. Abu-Lughod-the author herself is the discovery of this culture's use of poetry.  To take it one step further, the insight into how societies in general (at least ours and that of the Bedouins) similarly use their poetry and relate to it.<br /> Abu-Lughod finds that poetry is used somewhat differently among women in the Awlad ` Ali tribes than it is used by men. Because I am writing my own book of poetry called \\"Skyscapes: A Woman's View,\\" I was especially interested in this aspect of \\"Sentiments;\\" it also was, by the author's own admission, an amazing and important cultural discovery. A group of women in China have their own secret language apart from the men; now this anthropologist brings to our attention how the poetry and veiling customs of these women reveal their emotions and are rooted in the traditions of a society in which they live quite separately from men.<br /> Though this book is not meant for mainstream readers, I hope that many who have no ties to anthropology will make an effort to read it. I believe that women will find it especially interesting but men will also find pertinent information for today's political climate within its pages.  No amount of travel could impart the depth of understanding of this culture, and-by extension-similar cultures that this book does.<br />(Carolyn Howard-Johnson is the author of \\"This is the Place...\\" )was, by the author's own admission, an amazing and important cultural discovery.

The English speaking world has been mightily affected by the metaphor of Oz.  \\"Hey Dorothy You're Not in Kansas Anymore\\" does not disappoint.<br /> A young woman loses her father in a freak accident.  She is one of a family with enough peccadilloes among them to keep any reader fascinated.  She decides she will sleep her pain away, her mother decides she will run away with a cult, and brother decides to bury himself in his achievements and try to ignore the whole mess.  The pain in this family is palpable but so is their zest for living.  Those who loved \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" may like this book even better.  It has the snap of the new genre called chick lit to which \\"Diary\\" is a prominent member; like \\"Diary\\" it explores the pain that twenty-somethings often experience in a society that isn't keen on letting them grow up.<br /><br /> What makes this novel better is that Our Dear Dorothy is just more likeable than Bridget. She is not quite so needy, quite so miserable, is just less of a cookie-cutter character all around.<br /> What makes this novel move along so quickly is the authors background as a playwright.  The dialogue is quick and convincing.  The grounding is much like a theater production.  The settings are sufficiently presented but do not dominate.<br /> Mostly the humor is so natural.  I laughed out loud three times in the first two chapters and chuckled even more often.  All in all, it's a good lesson that the absurd may be found in the most agonizing of situations and that it works ever so well as a healer.<br />(Carolyn Howard-Johnson is the author of \\"Harkening: A Collection of Stories Remembered.\\")	2002-12-27

It's a title.  It's a title  that states the obvious. Because I once owned collectible gift  stores, I know-without the benefit of formal research-that most  humans are genetically coded to be packrats. Our history shows that  we were once hunters and gatherers with the emphasis on the  gathering.  Though we also saved the efforts of our hunt, at least  the parts we didn't eat.  We saved and used the bones, the quills,  the fur, the teeth and tusks.  It's in our bones so we might as well  know how to turn that fact to our advantage.<br /> It's much easier to  train our children up to be effective collectors instead of trying to  break them of a habit that is only the outcome of their natural  curiosity. Dan and Mary Hubley's book, \\"Kids Collect,\\" will do  that.<br /><br /> As a former teacher, I especially liked the chapters  on using collections for science fair projects and the teacher's  guide.  There is another that serves as an aid to parents and an  excellent index as well.<br /> As the author of two books based on my  own genealogy, my very favorite chapter is on collecting family  history.

Its proprietress reads lips.  She is rather like an all-seeing stage-manager in \\"Our Town\\" excepting that her life is intricately plaited with those of her customers and relatives.  Ella Brady is young and so impressionable she lets her hormones make decisions about love and life just as many of us have.  She falls for a loveable cad. She has a gaggle of friends and they have loves (or not).  Throw in the unlikely story of Quentin who gave his name but little else to the restaurant that he owns and a wealthy New Yorker who also happens to be Irish and, er, well, you get the idea.<br /> My advice is to forget trying to make all the fine connections and just go along for the ride.  Maeve Binchy is a superlative plotter who knows how to braid and knit intricate plots and how to write characters as well.  This bunch of mad Irish men and women are well worth following.  Pretend you are in a restaurant-much like Quentins-and are watching the people at the other tables and those passing by outside the window near your table.  You'd be entertained, right?<br /> \\"Quentins\\" is the same way.  It's a little like eating a holiday dinner peopled by a huge, talkative Irish family.

Like an hour, it can be singularly beautiful, a momentary flash and very long indeed.  Like the hours of our lives, it can feel fragmented, full, and intact--in increments or all at once.<br /><br /> Michael Cunningham has written a literary novel firmly revisiting the 1920s, Virginia Woolf and her novel, \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" I thought I would remember enough about Woolf's work to do justice to \\"The Hours.\\"  I was wrong. You, too, may want to reread the book to which \\"The Hours\\" pays tribute, if you are determined to get the most from it, hear the lingering whispers, find the subtle innuendoes, recognize the implications.<br /><br /> The story is told primarily from the viewpoint of three women whose lives we find are inexplicably intertwined.  A reader must be prepared that Cunningham-who has paid his dues-randomly breaks the rules that we, as new millennium readers, have come to expect. Most of us are not accustomed to a story told in first person, present tense. Many of us have not read a work that uses stream of consciousness since we read Faulkner in college. Cunningham jumps-effectively but unfamiliarly-from point of view to point of view.<br /><br /> Perhaps it is time that those of us who have gotten rusty extend ourselves a bit, both to improve our skills and our understanding.  This is a story about death and resurrection.  It seems an affirmation of lives that we may find trifling, insignificant.  Somehow, gently-very gently-Cunningham makes us see that existence is, after all, promising.

From at least the time of Shakespeare, pundits have been decrying the lack of class.  Noel Coward did it with such wit that it became an amusing pastime.  Lerner and Loewe distilled the concept into speech-both its sound and patterns-in the popular \\"My Fair Lady.\\" And now we have James A. Fisher who makes the same point in an effort to improve matters if we will but cooperate.<br /> Fisher is determined that we should speak impeccable English for success's sake. In \\"Talking Correctly for Success,\\" he aims to teach us how to avoid the most heinous pitfalls of our language in a very funny book.  Thus, he makes it easy to order at a French restaurant without sounding as if we grew up learning to read phonetically and believing the rest of the world did, too.  He decries \\"Slurvian,\\" our tendency to say \\"Djoo Eet?\\" for \\"Did you eat?\\"  He even tackles my personal ear-irritant, the incorrect usage of \\"lie\\" and \\"lay.\\"  And he does it in a practical and memorable way.<br /> This little paperback was originally copyrighted in 1996.  It has since gone into its 2nd edition.  For very good reason.  Even those of us who pride ourselves on our ability to use the English language can learn something from it.  It's just as important that if we choose to do it, refining our command of the English language with \\"Talking Correctly\\" will be a really fun pursuit.

The witch hunts are not pretty.  They may, however, speak to us several hundred years after a radical and closed society made them part of our heritage.<br /> This story is told from the viewpoints of three different family members.  We see a deluded sixteen-year-old plagued by guilt for her indiscretions, her father, Lucas Fowler, who is trying to be a good man but is caught up in mass hysteria, and her aunt who has brought not only her own physical beauty to town but an independence not frequently seen in either men or women in these times.<br />Sometimes I found both modern motivation and reasoning lacking in this novel and that was troubling. Then I stopped to reflect that it was not the fault of the author but of the subject matter.  I also began to wonder if there really is that much of a difference between these characters' actions and much of what we see in the world today.  This story is part of our own history.  Is what we see there really so different from what we are witnessing in our own world and even our own time?<br />Perhaps, then, this book is one that is right for this time and this place. Perhaps it is one that will not only entertain but remind us how important it is to guard our separation of church and state, our right to independent thought.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"	2002-11-13

Walt Brasch has something in common with Bill Clinton.  They both play sax.  That same Walt Brasch has something in common with me.  We've both been columnists.  What better excuse, then, for him to put together a book of his columns called \\"The Joy of Sax\\" and for me to write about it?<br /><br /> The \\"Joy of Sax\\" is subtitled \\"America During the Bill Clinton Era.\\" It couldn't have been assembled better by anyone. For one thing, Walt knows his stuff.  He covered part of the Clinton-Gore bus tour during their first campaign.  For another thing, he has good reporter skills.  He also wrote a lot of columns and that makes for a nice, fat book.  But mostly it's because Walt Brasch has a sense of humor.  If more people had a sense of humor during the Clinton years, we'd all have had a jollier time.  After all, we were all rich compared to the last couple of years.  For that matter, if we all had a better sense of humor now....<br /> But I digress.  Back to Walt's book.  Sometimes his humor is blatant.  Other times he lets you figure out what he's getting at but it's still funny as heck.  My favorite column is called \\"Singing Off-Key in the Starr Chamber\\" and it's my favorite for the first nine paragraphs that go like this:<br /> \\"When President John Adams imposed the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798...and violated the First Amendment, no one required him to testify before a special inquisitor.<br /> \\"When President Abraahm Lincoln suspended several Constitutional rights, no one required him to testify before a special inquisitor.<br /> When President U.S. Grant pleaded ignorance that his own cabinet was one of the most corrupt in history....\\"<br /> The next paragraphs include heinous \\"violations\\" by Warren G. Harding, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and the first George Bush.  I was rolling in the aisle and Brasch was only being droll.

Thankfully, they mostly disappear in favor of a lovely story based on a young woman's diary the author inherited from her grandfather.<br /> I say \\"thankfully\\" because the ghosts are never fully realized.  Ghosts, after all, have a tendency to be ethereal.  I say \\"thankfully\\" because the meat and bones history of a small mining town in Utah are much more interesting that ghosts. I say \\"thankfully\\" because the sweetness in this Utah town is not the ghosts but its tendency toward acceptance of all, regardless of color or religion.  And the story of how this town called Sweet Pie very nearly lost its innocence is of much greater value than any ghost story I've ever read.  I say \\"thankfully\\" because the protagonist, one Miss Cecily McKinsey, is of far more interest as a real life girl of her time than the eerie winds that whistle through the underground mines in her town ever could be.<br /><br /> Marilyn Brown is an author steeped in love for the history of her state.  She brings it alive in this unaffected novel about love and how it can be endangered by pettiness and how it can triumph when good people stand firm in the face of evil.<br /> The author's sensitivity is apparent in her language and her characters.  She is also the author of \\"Statehood\\" and \\"The Earthkeepers.\\"<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"	2002-10-21

Peck's first book did just that. After a lapse of many years, I started writing again, my health improved and yes, I attribute that to Peck's first &quot;Road Less Traveled.&quot;<br />I don't know how this second one will affect my next decade for I haven't yet walked down that road.  I expect that it will make some major difference for me. I suppose it might for anyone who reads it with a willing spirit.<br />One of the things I learned from Peck is to consciously be open to new ideas or to refamiliarizing oneself with good, old ones. Being quick to find fault is often nothing more than a defense of old practices that may allow us to protect ourselves so that we feel oh, so comfortable. Growing pains are sometimes preferable to warm fuzzies.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"	2002-10-14

A teacher in novel writing might suggest that it isn't long enough or fleshed out enough to be a full-fledged novel; it's not quite a memoir either. It reminds me more of a long short story.

Somehow, \\"First the Raven\\" appears in print just when interest in its subject matter is high, precisely when its message is needed.<br /> The characters in this lovely first novel by Leora G. Krygier are Israeli transplants on Los Angeles soil.  Their experiences in America are so germane to this moment in geopolitics it is difficult to imagine a more perfectly timed release. It is as if this little volume was sent to us so that we might better understand not only the immigrant experience, but also that we might see Israeli divisions that we have never before observed-at least not up close and personal as this story presents them.<br /> The narrative centers on a journey of redemption for Amir that begins when he befriends Rosenberg, an elderly Holocaust survivor who he identifies with the Israeli politics that Amir was only too happy to leave behind.  Amir's relationship with a wife he loves is unraveling and his daughter is entangled with the kind of legal and moral morass that every parent fears the most.  Amir longs for the freedom he once felt as a parachuter, feels a vague disease with his new home, a longing for his old.<br /><br /> Amir's new friend is also emotionally detached from his wife and his son.  The two strangers come together in a small restaurant in a Jewish section of Los Angeles only because it is so popular they must share a table.  In spite of Amir's reluctance to associate with the old Orthodox Jew, Amir slowly accommodates Rosenberg's loneliness and in so doing finds someone who has just the right connections and character to help him through the explosions that he must face in the days ahead.<br /> In turn, Amir's virility, common sense and vulnerability combine to offer something the elderly Rabbi is not finding in his other relationships.  We see how differences can heal rather than divide, a very real lesson for today's world.<br /><br /> Krygier tells this story with sensitivity and with a command of language not seen in many mainstream novels. Consider this poetry in prose:<br /> \\"(Amir) remembered his first jump, looking up into the fullness of the canopy, its lined geometry, the softness of its membrane.  The flapping fabric was gossamer-thin, like a wing...\\"<br /> \\"....she flirted with him...with competence, as if she were following her grandmother's recipes for yeast cake-just a little but not too much.\\"<br /> \\"Through the peephole...he could still see her, sitting on the step, round, through the fisheye, as if she were floating in an amniotic sac.\\"<br /> \\"It was an altered sky, cloudless and mute, tinted with faint paper-white strokes.\\"<br /> Part of the power of Krygier's passages may be credited to experience.  She was born in Tel-Aviv and grew up in Philadelphia.  She now lives in Los Angeles, and descriptions of that city ground the work; there is not a city street or a vista out of place.  Her experience as a referee in the juvenile division of the Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles also gives her first-person insight into the system that young offenders must confront when they stray.<br /> First the Raven is the kind of story that gives us something to take away with us once we have turned its last page.  It may or may not change a readers' perspective, but it certainly will give her comfort and confidence in the future.  It's hard to imagine that we could ask more.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"oday's world.<BR> <BR> Krygier tells this story with sensitivity and with a command of language not seen in many mainstream novels.

I've read how-tos that could help in one's personal life (like &quot;Word Works&quot;) and how-tos like Syd Field's that give great advice for screenwriters and also might help novelists.  I've also contributed to an e-book called &quot;Musings&quot; that ruminates on life, love and the written word. This, however, is the first I've seen that is quite this flexible.<br /> As a former teacher, I can see &quot;The Playful Way to Serious Writing&quot; by Roberta Allen as a tool for elementary teachers, art teachers, photography teachers, English and creative writing teachers.  Allen is a photographer and artist as well as a writer and this book is the most visual, the most appealing and the most practical exercise book yet.<br /> That it is also fun is definitely a plus.  I shall probably use my copy when speaking to genealogy groups about how to turn their heritage into readable stories.  I plan to take a couple of the exercises in the book to my critique group (boy, will they be surprised!) and I plan to use a couple of Allen's graphically delightful pages when I tutor my Korean students.  These pages weren't meant for that but think of the ESL possibilities in phrases like &quot;a goatee&quot; and &quot;a potbelly.&quot; Immigrants often have the English basics. It is the colloquial phrases that throw them.<br /><br /> If you happen to run across this book on the shelf of your bookstore, grab a copy and open it.  Leaf through the pages.

So is this small book of poetry and art called \\"The Breathing Field. The poetry is by Wyatt Townley; Eric Dinyer is the artist.<br /> \\"Slide under the scars where meteors dug their graves in us a millennia ago,\\" it advises.  And then we do.  As we read, we discard the accoutrements that we no longer need, and breathe life.  I suspect that this will be so even for those who do not know yoga for the images are accessible, beautiful and touching.<br /> Although I know yoga, I do not think that one must know it to imbibe.  Poetry is meant to reach out.  This poetry may convert some to drinking of yoga's serenity; others may be touched only in the moment.  That is, after all, what poetry and yoga are about-the moment.<br /> Townley's images are simple, beautiful and understandable. \\"Here, inside the chest,\\" she says, \\"a tiny fear is folded neatly like a sweater.\\" I've always ascribed to the theory that poetry should be close kin to our every day speech.  It seems Townley might feel the same way.<br /> Unfortunately, I can hardly impart a sense of the images by Eric Dinyer. They are exquisite. They feel like painted photographs, remind me of those patterns one sees behind one's eyelids, deep within the realm of ourselves where reality and soul reside.<br /> What a lovely gift this small book of 72 pages has given to me.  What a lovely gift it would make for someone else.<br /><br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"	2002-10-04

She calls it a \\"how-come\\" book, but by virtue of the fact that humankind has a tendency to handle itself better when it understands a process, it becomes a how-to book. The quintessential how-to book.<br /><br />This is a book that teaches self-defense and assertiveness and...well, you get the idea. It is mostly a book that helps women understand why we are \\"beauties\\" that must \\"bite\\" the beast and how that can be changed to benefit us all.<br />The author is well equipped to give advice. She received her J.D. degree at a time when women attending her Loyola Law School were in a small minority.  She is a self-defense advocate and instructor.  She is an actress, a producer, and a director.  She rails-humorously-against injustices each week as a columnist for the \\"Pasadena Weekly\\" and she is a professor of Communication Studies at California State University at Los Angeles.  Communication is, in fact, the crown that \\"Beauty\\" wears that covers all of these pursuits.  &quot;Beauty Bites Beast&quot; is the culmination of Snortland's abilities and need to communicate in an area that-even after several decades of progress-still has room for a whole lot of improvement.<br />Oh!

When Rogers waves his wand of philosophical and psychological wisdom, a writer's frailties are diminished, her strengths magnified.<br /><br /> Though a writer is certain to find this book a precious talisman for the pursuit of the written word, it should also discourage her from attempting another book of the same sort.

They are somehow both removed and concrete. The author has included special notes on their chronology.  The images in the earlier ones are more evocative, more substantial, than in the later ones.  Time and memory are important themes.<br /> For the average reader, the value in these poems will be that they echo those periods when each of us feels hopeless, listless or unconnected.  We felt that way even when we were young--if we stopped long enough to consider our emotions then-and their presence becomes more pronounced as we age.  If we follow Koethe's lead, we will not deny these thoughts-then and now, now and then--for who are we if not what we think?<br /> Koethe himself says \\"disappointment surrounds these poems.\\" And yet there is enlightenment in this book because his poetry is proof that when we think these thoughts, we are not alone.  In spite of the melancholy, \\"North Point North\\" is an affirmation.<br /> Koethe also says that words \\"still pass (es) for celebration...\\" In the words between the covers of this book, there is a both an absence of celebration and a commemoration.

Many readers searching for their first literary experience may choose it, reasoning that it must be one of the more accessible examples of \\"literary\\" because it is so popular.  I worry that if an inveterate romance, crime or science fiction reader picks up this book, she's not going to try literary again.<br />If, in fact the difference between a \\"literary\\" novel and genre fiction is that literary is character-driven and not plot-driven then this book is, indeed, literary.  However, many literary novels focus on character and still have plots that carry the reader in rapt attention from beginning to end.<br />Joy Luck will not do this.  It is beautifully written.  The voice is superb.  There may (arguably) be no other book that gives its reader a sense of the Chinese culture in America, of the oriental mindset of many of our Asian sisters as well as this one does.  It also tells stirring stories and therein lies the problem, it tells several of them.<br />In fact it might have been better billed as a collection of stories.  There is a thread between them, but so is there in many short story collections. The thread in \\"Joy Luck\\" is not linear and it will take a conscientious reader to track the relationships between the story tellers in each chapter.  If a reader unfamiliar with \\"literary\\" works should take this book as the norm, she sadly may turn away from others.<br />Those seeking a poignant afternoon or two of reading should consider this book.  Those who might want to test literary waters might do better with a book that is more consciously aware of pacing, that leans more toward traditional narrative, say Anna Karinina by Tolstoy.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"	2002-08-05

These two giants (Massie and Peter) propelled the City on the Neva to my list of top ten must-see places in the world.<br />I have had the hardcover (ISBN 031210443) in my library since 1981.  Since I read it, Massie's call to Russia has been nagging me.<br />This summer I finally went with a program called Summer Literary Seminars.  I pulled my tattered copy from my bookshelves and reread it.  I warn those who are looking for light reading that this is a real history, full of detail. It is also exciting and thoroughly awe inspiring.  Massie is a consummate historian but he could not go wrong with Peter as his subject.<br />I advise those who are interested in this period and this place to get their hands on the hardback.  It contains maps and pictures that will increase both understanding and enjoyment.  If, however, the paperback is the easier choice, my recommendation should not deter you from reading it at all.  Given a choice, paperback is better than nothing.<br />Buy a nice lemon-yellow highlighter before you curl up with this book.  Part of the fun will be keeping a record of the places you will want to go, the things you will want to see when-not if-you get to St. Petersburg, Peter's (and Robert's) city of canals, seagulls and art.

I'll bet if anyone bothered to ask Mr. White, he might have a soft spot in his heart for people in general, Mormons included.<br />If I have any criticism of \\"Higher Authority\\" it is that, though the basics are researched, it is soon apparent that Ambrose didn't live in Utah long, if at all.  It's not that he gets anything in terms of description or background really wrong, just that it somehow feels incomplete.<br />This is, however, how genre fiction is often written.  And this book IS fiction.  The author does not claim that this story actually happened. Nor does he suggest it will. He is spinning a tale and he does it well.  \\"Higher Authority\\" is not a philosophical treatise. It's a novel.  A GENRE novel. Read it an enjoy it for what it is.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"	2002-05-19

The subtitle says &quot;SOME Instructions on Writing and LIFE.&quot; What you see is what you get.<br />This book is a perfect introduction to writing for beginning writers just as, I suspect, LaMott's courses are.  More advanced writers should get out their Hi-liters and pay attention not so much to WHAT she says but HOW she says it.  It also wouldn't hurt to look at her self deprecating humor (I don't see where these readers are seeing all that self-absorption stuff--I truly don't!)and her honesty.<br />Could some of this be professional jealousy? This is a book that gives what it promises and more!  And yes, some of the advice is similar to advice that has been given by others.  Writers' books are sort of a genre of their own--in the vein of King's and others.  A little memoir, a little humor, a little advice.  How much new can be said about how to write anyway?<br /><br /> Writers or wanna be writers should find this a nice, savory little book to be read a little at a time, bird by bird.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"	2002-05-10

So here it is.  In spite of the fact that some of the characters in this novel don't have the depth I prefer in literary novels, this one is so full of plot, so full of lessons to be learned (no preaching, of course!) that I can't help but love it.<br />When you read it, note that the protagonist had doubts about the man she marries.  Not the normal things like, \\"This is a huge step, do I really want to do it?\\" but bigger ones that point, in this case, to a dishonest nature.

The protagonist and his new wife lose themselves (rather stupidly but oh so humanly, I thought) in a cave and the protagonist spends some thoughtful moments--both in the cave and later--trying to discern what he had learned from the experience.  The conclusion he came to seemed a bit contrived, as if it didn't follow naturally from the experience.<br /><br /> All in all, though, this is a warm and wonderful book and Karon is a first-rate writer.  Delightful characters are hard to find these days, as hard to find as readers with long attention spans.  If anyone can keep a reader riveted for three whole books, it may very well be Jan Karon.	2002-04-12

Penguin deserves credit for publishing a work that may be to the taste of very few.<br /> Still, there are some problems.<br /><br /> 1.  Four tapes with no direction at the beginning of each tape makes for way too much fumbling at speeds over 40--and one is likely to be listening to these cassettes in the car.

The first book has to have an ending but not so much of one that the reader won't want to follow the characters they have learned to know on to the next book.  The author faces the same task with the second.<br /><br /> A Light in the Window is Jan Karon's second in a series.  It was originally a trilogy (at least in the set I purchased), but is now a series.  Karon does serialization very well not only because her characters are likeable but also because she understands that, if a book can't have a nice, tight ending, then at least it had better have a satisfying premise.<br /> \\"Light,\\" the second book in the series about a small town in the Carolinas, is really about commitment and fear.  Although the characters and place seem almost to be from another century, the theme is well-grounded in the problems that many of us face today.  The story does seem to unfold gently in another time and another place, even though it is firmy let in the present.  Still, it is not \\"only\\" a tender tale but contains a lesson or two for most lives today.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"	2002-03-08

Many of the books geared to the business world are fat, ugly, and bone-dry.<br /><br /> Jeff Tobe has taken his book on creativity, marketing and sales quite a few steps beyond that. He has been thinking , creating, and \\"Coloring Outside the Lines.\\" He presents basic approach to business within a slim, memorable volume.<br /><br /> The author polishes up a dull subject with images from the sports world and from children's games. He supplies an intriguing diagnosis of stale business practices he calls BPIP (Business Professionals Innovation Deficiency) with all its symptoms.  These include Past-a-Plegia, Internal Myopia, and Psycho-Sclerosis, all of which make anthrax seem innocuous.  You will want to learn about these because they are diseases anyone can contract.<br /><br /> The book itself is a tribute to Tobe's own philosophies.  The cover looks more like an Easter egg than a business book, the typeface is positively enchanting (and readable) and his advice is anecdotal, not built with dry-old, tired-old businessese.  His message is to achieve success by thinking differently; this book illustrates this very premise.

Here we have a story that combines a whodunit with some memorable characters, a little romance and a straight-forward attack at moving a mystery along.

Yes.  Is it entertaining?  Absolutely.  Will you like the characters?  Sure.  Are you going to carry the story with you always?  Probably not.

One of my writing teachers from UCLA, Michael Levine, once said, \\"Grisham is a master at setting up scenes.\\" I am a master at taking good advice so I decided to check out his technique.<br /><br /> We all struggle with first chapters.  Grisham's is masterful.  He uses first person which was a bit of a surprise for a novel in which courtrooms and legal finagling are cornerstones.  But what a way to get up close and personal, to draw a reader in.<br /> In this chapter Grisham sets up an ideal legal situation, a ploy that sets the tone for the entire book. He also does something very daring.  He kills off the person from whose viewpoint the story is being told.  Yes, the first person narrator dies at the end of the first chapter leaving the reader wondering what the heck happened and how he is supposed to get from first chapter to last with his aging, recalcitrant first person storyteller dead and gone.<br /> Grisham is willing to do all of this in order to get the reader in a stranglehold and never let him go but he risks creating exactly the opposite effect.<br /><br /> In the second chapter Grisham jumps to the more usual third person and never returns.  This all works because, though Troy Phelan, the original narrator, has committed suicide, the entire book will still revolves around the machinations that he has set in motion and we still get the third person we have come to expect with this kind of story for the rest of the book.  Grisham took a risk when there was a benefit to doing so.<br /> I also liked that Grisham used symbols that were unobtrusive. Nate, the alcoholic protagonist who has seen way too much water flow under the bridge is out on the adventure of his lifetime and observes, behind his boat, \\"a view of the wake and the muddy brown water bubbling behind him.\\" Don't even suggest that this is accidental.  It is intended for sure, but it seeps into the reader's subconscious instead of smacking him between the eyes.<br /><br /> Grisham's work is not intended to be terrifically literary.  He is short on symbol, metaphor, and philosophy.  Some would argue that this is all to the good and it is certainly one of the reasons his scenes move along quickly.<br /><br /> Unlike some of my favorite authors (like John Updike) Grisham's vocabulary is very familiar.  It would be unlikely for a reader to find one word (I did; it was \\"scintilla\\") that he or she isn't absolutely sure about it.  I personally think there is nothing wrong with stretching the reader a bit and I don't think it necessarily slows down any but the most exacting of readers.  Grisham, I think, chooses not to do this in the interest of perfect scene structure and a fast-moving story.<br /><br /> I also find Grisham's work short on detail.  It is not because he can't do it.  In one place he notes that, \\"blood filled in the mortar cracks and ran in perfect right angles down a gentle slope.\\" Can't get more vivid than that.  I think he chooses not to use his gift for seeing detail in order to keep his chapters and scenes moving along.  One is sacrificed for the other.  Which you choose, as a writer, depends on what you are trying to do.<br /> It's pretty much the same when making a choice as a reader.  What do you want more?  A fast moving story or something to chew on for years to come?  Choices. Choices.  It's all about choices.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"f his lifetime and observes, behind his boat, \\"a view of the wake and the muddy brown water bubbling behind him.\\" Don't even suggest that this is accidental.

The very name of the series conjured up the delights one might find inside.  The covers were shiny and new and smooth and were a metaphor for the gift of reading. The size indicated that it would not take long to find the jewels within. Alison Stine's &quot;Lot Of My Sister&quot; is much the same sort of book.<br /> A slender chapbook, it is clothed in a cover that is a delight to touch and not so brilliantly colored that one will expect exlosions within its covers.  This is a book of poetry, after all, and one comes to it expecting a different kind of experience.<br /> By any standard, this is a lovely book of poetry but it most touching when Stine describes the special sounds of being deaf.  When she touches on this aspect of her own life, the poems become close and personal.  As she says, they &quot;come back to me as music.&quot;<br /><br /> Consider this:<br /><br /> From &quot;Fields Beyond Fields:&quot;<br /> &quot;...one hand memorized<br /> the closed mouths of lockers...&quot;<br /> This slim volume is also full of moments when we share other bits of humanity with the author:<br /> &quot;...the swallow of our morning cups.&quot;<br />and the image of a cancer survivor:<br /> &quot;eyelashes like tea leaves<br /> in her morning cup?&quot;<br /> &quot;Lot Of My Sister&quot; is a little books that offers twenty-five pages for twenty-five moments of respite--moments that anyone can &quot;work in&quot; to their schedule and so enrich their lives.<br /><br /> I could have used twenty-five more delectible pages, twenty-five more memorable moments.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"	2002-01-25

The gold is repeated on the fly leaf and the blurbs are surrounded with a border depicting the heavens atwinkle with stars.<br /><br /> For those who enjoy a thoughtful book, the interior will match the beauty of the exterior.  Sobel, the author of &quot;Longitude,&quot; has done her homework and has a way with words besides. She brings Galileo and his friend and nemesis, Pope Urban VIII, alive.  She opens ones eyes to Galileo's science and religion and even his beloved city, Florence.<br /> There was one disappointment: in spite of the fact that the book is built around the letters of Galileo's daughter, it is not really about her.  Instead the daughter's letters hold a mirror up to her famous and brilliant father.  What those letters reveal about her seem practically incidental.  One can read between the lines but Sobel does very little of that for you.  She is a writer interested in the big events, the philosophical issues of the time.  The quiet, dutiful daughter gets short shrift-even in a book titled after her.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"	2002-01-25
US	45339081	R1Z0QPO7YRN1YV	0151004722	910037782	Soulsaver	Books	5	13	13	N	Y	For Readers Interested in Writing	A novel that uses first person, present tense is not easy to find, probably because there are not many convincing reasons to use it.  In Soulsaver,  James Stevens-Arce does it well.<br /><br />  This book is an interesting and fast-paced satire.  The protagonist, Juan Bautista Lorca, is a callow youth blinded by the society in which he lives.  That Stevens-Arce chooses to tell his story from this little twerp's viewpoint is daring for the reader doesn't take immediately to him.  Stevens-Arce carefully mitigates that problem in several ways.<br />  First, he doesn't get inside his head much until the character begins to change, and to grow.  We can never be certain but I believe this was a conscious decision because poor Juan doesn't have a deep thought stored anywhere in there, anyway.  It is a perfect approach to this kind of character building.<br /> One of the difficulties of using this method is that the reader gets less insight into the character than we have become accustomed to.  Any we do get comes from the dialogue and/or what is happening around Juan.  There is an advantage here, as well.  The action moves forward very quickly and we find ourselves immersed in the time (The Year of Our Lord 2099) and the place (San Juan, the capitol city of our 52nd state).  And, surprising, this is enough.  The author has carefully balanced what the reader is likely to miss with what she gets.<br /> As Juan develops and finds his own depth, we find that Steven-Arce is a writer with a first-class instinct for words as well.  For those of us who long to see, hear, and feel when we read, this novel is not a disappointment. We must wait, but we get wonderful similes like, \\"...the sun...looks like a communion wafer pasted against the sky,\\" and  \\"...the Swiss cheese of pigeon holes cut into the ancient wall...\\"  Stevens-Arce has crafted a book where there is only straightforward, uncluttered writing until the reader is hooked.  Only then do we find passages that are pure poetry.  By that time we find ourselves literally gobbling it up.<br />  Stevens-Arce has one more trick to keep the reader hanging in there while this shallow youth ogles breasts, bounces to the music blasting into his headphones and relishes his own benign happiness with himself and the god-awful world he doesn't see around himself.  He uses present tense.  I hate present tense.  Yet I hardly noticed.  It propels the novel forward when it needs momentum.  After it has done its job the reader becomes so used to it, it is no longer a factor.<br />  If I were still teaching English, this book would become one of my texts.  It's not often that one finds first person, present tense put to such carefully crafted use.  It's also not often that one finds a book that lauds the often-maligned ability of thinking for oneself.  Next to Holden Caulfield, Juan Bautista Lorca may be the best literary example for youth in recent times.are pure poetry.

At first they are subtle like the ones we have in our own lives.  We hardly notice that they dwell among us; they nestle in our busy lives unnoticed.<br /><br /> Soon, however, we notice the secrets in this book. They come faster and faster, piling up like compounded interest. There are secrets of all sorts.  Some are kept because of blackmail, some because of guilt.  There are secrets that are only disguised prejudices, secrets that surround a legend like the aura of perfume.<br /><br /> Grisham's protagonist, six-year-old Luke Chandler, becomes so inundated in secrets the pressure builds like it does in the cooker his gran and mother use to \\"put up\\" tomatoes and beans. \\"Lots of secrets,\\" he says, \\"and no way to unload them.\\"<br /><br /> Finally the book is about telling secrets as release.  That can be done in a myriad of ways, too.  If one is an author, he might fictionalize secrets and put them in a really good book. The trick is to find the perfect voice, just the right time, and just the right audience.  Grisham does just that.<br /> This may be the book John Grisham always wanted to write.  If he's not careful he may soon have the whole nation reading literary novels as freely as they do romances or mysteries.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"	2002-01-24
