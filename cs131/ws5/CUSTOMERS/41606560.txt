That aside, this work was well written. <br />To those who are familiar with the tendencies in Bennett's plays and works for films.... the themes to be found in this book shall come as no surprise. British snootiness, clashes between generations and their values, clashes between the sexes, nationalism, sex humor, and bathroom humor are once again in Bennett's work.<br />The Ransome's return home from a night of listening to Mozart to find their home completely empty... toilet paper and all. During this time, they find themselves of having to get things to reidentify themselves. But along with the purchase of these things comes the questions... who do I really want to be and what do I want to be characterized by? At least these questions plague Mrs. Ransome as she runs across foreign stores that she would have never considered before. The book delves deeply into the awakening of identity of Mrs. Ransome and the resistance she meets from her husband.<br />This is one of Bennett's more interesting and solemn works. Though not a great in literature, it does capture a snapshot of British life in an age of transition.<br />Crazy James	2001-11-15

In fact, everyone in his family has suffered from his cursed &quot;dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-grandfather&quot;. Currently Stanley Yelnats in at Camp Green Lake a reform camp for boys who have the option of going there or going to jail. A sorry choice for a boy who is found guilty of a crime that he did not commit. <br />But hey, Camp Green Lake sounds likes a nice place though right? Well, it does sound nice except for it is in the middle of nowhere in the hot blistering sun. The residents each day have to dig a five foot hole five feet in diameter at the bottom. Perhaps this is not so bad in and of itself, except for the rattlesnakes, tarantulas, and the yellow-spotted lizards (they are the only animals whose bite means certain death)... Did I mention that there was no lake at Camp Green Lake anymore?<br />Sachar brilliantly blends in narrative from the past of Stanley's family with the history of Camp Green Lake in conjunction with present circumstances that makes for a truly captivating read. I would recommend this book to anyone.<br />Crazy James	2001-11-14

Though written over 30 years ago, The Pigman is a book that has proven it can withstand the test of time. John Conlan and Lorraine Jensen are pranksters who both come from dysfunctional families. Lorraine's mother is a single parent who is afraid to death of men and thinks all that is on their mind is sex. John Conlan's dad is an alcoholic stock trader who wants his son to follow the family profession rather than developing an increasing fondness for beer. Through accident, or perhaps through destiny they meet the Pigman. <br />In the Pigman, they finally find out what it means to be carefree, and to have fun like a child. Through their relationship with the Pigman, Lorraine and John's perspective of their lives is forever changed.<br />Crazy James	2001-11-13

Brooks includes a supernatural element of incredible players joining a less than average team the day after one of the players creates a baseball card for that player. The argument of the book is that it is better to have a team that plays poorly than to have a group of players who may win but are still not a team. The argument, though decent in and of itself is one of the most poorly executed I have run across to date.<br />It took me about an hour to read Throwing Smoke... It was a quick read, but not quick enough for me to say the book wasn't a waste of time to read. My advice to baseball fans is to read some books on baseball by Will Weaver.<br />Crazy James	2001-11-13

But no place has been quite as charming and yet as curious as their new house on the end of Crescent Lane. After all, in what other neighborhood, would a young man and his dog mysteriously appear and disappear. And in what other neighborhood would you discover that odd things are happening not only at your house but your neighbors' houses as well. Finding clues to these disturbances leads Jenny not only to the discovery of a fifty year old secret, but also what it means to be truly part of a neighborhood.

Imagine if you were a bright, beautiful, and popular teenager from a rich family.

Imagine that your teachers will not do anything about your insanity because they are too scared of your parents. Imagine desperately trying to find a way to call out for help when most authority figures ignore you. This is the situation that Lisa finds herself in. It is her friends who try to remedy the situation and save Lisa from herself.<br />I found this book to be both dated and implausible though perhaps more possible thirty years ago than today... I am not positive. The story is trying in the beginning but ended decently. For teens interested in psychological novels, this book might prove to be a pleasing read. I do believe I would more likely recommend Cut by Patricia McCormick and Stop Pretending: What Happened When my Big Sister Went Crazy by Sonya Sones.<br />Crazy James	2001-10-30

Beginning in the city of Dawson in the Yukon, Jason and his dreamgirl, Jamie, paddle a canoe in a race to Nome against hundreds of others!  The time is the gold rush at the turn of the 1900s in the Yukon territory. The setting is colorful, with nods to the gambling, drinking, and dancing that took place during the time. Names from the old west, such as Wyatt Earp and Calamity Jane appear in the tale that gives a good sketch of what was taking place at the time.<br />The story begins well with a confrontation between the brothers and the Sydney Mauler and carries along well, but it did not seem believable. When Jamie and Jason venture to race together, I wondered how a teenage boy and girl travelling together would have been perceived and was somewhat disappointed that this aspect was ignored. Though Down the Yukon is the sequel to Jason's Gold, it most defnitely stands on its own as a story, and for that Will Hobbs is to be commended... I look forward to reading more of his work.<br />Crazy James	2001-10-30

The title does indeed say it all: Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales. The book stinks and the tales are stupid. I honestly feel like I have wasted my time for having read it. The only reason that I gave it two stars is that some of the art has creative redeeming value with the picture of the table of contents crashed, having some pages that are blank, and blanks spots where reluctant characters have run away. The art work and the text layout are worth studying. The text reads like a series of poorly executed campfire stories with the ugly duckng simply growing up to be an ugly duck and instead of having the sky not fall... the table of contents falls and crushes all of the characters in Chicken Licken...<br />Crazy James	2001-10-30

Lirael is Garth Nix's continuation of Sabriel which shall apparently be followed by a third book by the name of Abhorsen. With Lirael, he begins flesh out the world created in Sabriel  and lays down the groundwork for what could be an epic series that could perhaps stretch across numerous volumes. Lirael is probably strong enough to stand on its own... though it is highly recommended that one begin with Sabriel in order to catch the richness of Nix's world that includes a wonderful play between two areas: one steeped in early twentieth century technology and the other basking in the heights of fantasy.<br />In the course of the book we discover Lirael, daughter of the Clayr who wines because it seems she will never meet the desires of her tribe because she lacks vision to see into the future. We also run across Prince Sameth, who is scared of his expected destiny as Abhorsen-in-waiting (a necromancer whose job is to keep the dead, dead). Aside from the pity parties that fill a good portion of the book, there are numerous exciting encounters with monsters... though none of them seem to be as dark and forbidding as the encounters in Sabriel.<br />Lirael is well worth the read, though it is not quite as exciting as Sabriel. I look forward to Abhorsen and hopefully some more exciting plot developments.<br />Crazy James	2001-10-23

This book was most defnitely an interesting to read, if not altogether a delight. The intricacies of the relationships that Helen Keller experienced with Annie Sullivan, her mother, Alexander Graham Bell, the socialist party, the Roosevelts, and John Macy, were given careful attention that have been lacking in many of the other books that I have read on Helen Keller. Helen proved to be an extremely fascinating woman rather than just the product of Annie Sullivan's genius at teaching.<br />Joan Dash's work is to be highly commended. If there is one flaw with her work, it is that some of the sections are slow and cumbersome to read in comparison with the rest of the book. It misses the five star mark only because it is not an altogether smooth read. Nonetheless, Dash's work should be viewed as a treasure amongst Helen Keller biographies for decades to come.<br />Crazy James	2001-10-19

Through the collection of the poems, we not only see the reactions the younger sister has at home, amongst friends, and at school, we see the reactions of her family, and how the older sister's treatment is progressing. <br />The book is well written with a fast flowing pace... though some of the poems do not read like poetry. Some of the poems are more realistically sentences put in poetry format. However, there a number of poems that arre beautifully poignant, such as one that describes the older sister being carried away during a family visitation after throwing a Monopoly board into the air. The book is thought-provoking without being preachy. It is also an extremely quick read. Silently, I read it in less than forty minutes... and if, like me, you like to read poetry aloud... it can be read in less than two hours. All in all, Stop Pretending is a very pleasing read.<br />Crazy James	2001-10-19

Arlene the Sardine is very close to this line in dealing with the issue of death. Those who are scared of the potential of suicide might be very frightened by this book and would rate it low accordingly. The book, about a young fish who wants to become a sardine deals with death in an exceptionally playful manner... so playful that some could consider it macabre. This is a book one will either love or hate. Though, I was somewhat disturbed by the book... I believe that the book is exceedingly well done, with beautiful illustrations, and a playful narrative. It seemed reminiscent of the fairy tales of old... which were far more dark than today's Disney versions. It is a book definitely worth checkig out from your local library.<br />Crazy James	2001-10-19

In a friendship that grows Lindsay learns about the world of the mole people or downsiders from Talon. Talon comes to learn of the topside world because of the relationship as well. But what may seem to be an innocent friendship at first could be the pin of a grenade that is pulled resulting in a war of downsiders against topsiders.<br />The book does have a rich premise, with wonderful details, and charming characters... but it suffers from having an implausible group of cows running through the underground of New York and a weak ending. Downsiders, is a good book that Shusterman and his editor should have spent more time on in order to make it a great one.<br />Crazy James	2001-10-17

She is determined to maintain her values. She is determined to rise above the circumstances of having an alcoholic father, an alzheimer-ridden grandmother, and a little sister that is of little support. Jenna sells shoes. Or at least she sells shoes until the president of Gladstone Shoe Stores, Mrs. Gladstone hires her to drive her from store to store from Chicago all of the way down to Dallas where the big stockholder meeting is held. Along the way, Jenna does not only learn about the value of shoes, but the value of holding onto quality both in purchases and in character. It is this value of quality that lead Mrs. Gladstone and Jenna to try to resist a corporate takeover by business guru Ken Woldman, and Mrs. Gladstone's son, Elden. The book is well written, though the characterization lacks depth at points. The book is a feel good story if there ever was one... but it does not make the mistake of getting overly sappy and ridiculous. Rules of the Road is definitely more than worth the read.	2001-10-17

The humor in Falconer's work is contagious with its harmonious blend of illustration and text. The illustrations are done in a &quot;limited&quot; palette of black white and red with an occasional brown thrown in. Please do not make the mistake of thinking that this book may be handicapped because of its limited palette. It merely serves to increase the reader's delight in Olivia and her world.

Sid Fleischman's A Carnival of Animals has some cute stories that are joined loosely together under the premise that a carefree little tornado passed by the area near Barefoot Mountain and a number of animals' lives were changed accordingly. <br />One of the main problems of this collection of short stories is other than that a number of them relate to animals, the stories in actuality do not always mesh by a underlying thread while others seem to relate to each other. Some of the stories are cute such as the story of what happened to the clumsy frog that ate too many Mexican jumping beans, but some just seem to fill time and space.<br />The pictures are mediocre and not particularly inspiring. All in all, this book would be a welcome respite from the tedium of a doctor's office, or of passing interest for a night's read... but it is certainly not destined to be a widespread childhood favorite.<br />Crazy James	2001-10-10

The story, by adult standards is choppy in its progression, but is quite charming in its childlike perspective of the harshness that the pilgrims must have faced both on the Mayflower and in the founding of Plymouth including the time of the Thanksgiving feast. The story is sandwiched between pages that give interesting details of the ship, the voyage, and the people and events of the time that would be certain to satisfy the curious reader or listener.

The truth is that though I love the Alice series and halfway was amused by the writings of Louise Rennison on Georgia Nicolson, Truth or Dairy had all the flavor to me of a glass of wheatgrass juice.

She works at a juice and ice cream shop by the name of Truth and Dairy, makes vague attempts at being a vegetarian, and refuses to go out with a guy for the school year. <br />There are some bright moments of reprieve in the book, such as when she admits how lame of a person she is in her diary and when her friends liven up the diary by adding their own entries. The supporting cast of characters: her brother Bryan, her friends Beth and Jane, nice guy Grant Superior, and others add just enough saving grace to keep from wanting to return this concoction of words for a refund. <br />Crazy James	2001-10-10
