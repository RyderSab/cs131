Narration and perspectives alternate among these women, on how they are trying to help Grace, as well as dealing with their own personal lives and inner conflicts. <br /> <br />It's an interesting soup of love, families, and friends. One faces divorce, another is having an affair,  yet another is separating from her woman lover, and the last one seems to have it all. Yet they come together to be there for Grace and her daughter. <br /> <br />But Grace and her illness seem to be weird in many ways. The friends starts to get bewildered by things that do not add up. In their effort to help her, things get out of control.. and the story gets really interesting, what with the speculation and anticipation! Not being truthfully honest somehow spoils the otherwise beautifully reciprocal true friendship. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, it remains a mystery. The author justifies this by highlighting that in real life we don't always know all there is to know. But I want to know the story, as whole as possible, and  aren't books suppose to transport us to a world of more understanding? But the catch is maybe the author is trying to show that not knowing the whole story is one way of understanding..	2004-08-08

That's because Islam is mostly portrayed negatively by the media, particularly when it comes to women! <br /> <br />I could only imagine how families, especially the mothers, react to the conversion. They surely care and want the best for the daughters. However, it is a long and difficult process to let them go on the path they choose, no matter how well-meaning the families are. <br /> <br />This book provides some explanation to the Faith and the Practices - the concepts and reasons. I suppose if would help the family make sense of it all, in order for all parties involved (the daughter, her husband, and her original family) to understand each other. <br /> <br />Carol Anway and her Muslim daughter, Jodi, did a study based on a survey where questionnaires were answered by 53 American women from different background and age who converted to Islam. The feedback was used to identify the common problems faced by them and their families, as well as the workarounds that could be useful to others. <br /> <br />Carol also speaks from her own experience. The book gives suggestions to the families on how to arrange for things, how to accept the changes, and how to accomodate for the \\"different\\" needs. It also provides suggestions to the Muslim daughters (and the husbands) on how to maintain good relationships with the families. <br /> <br />I think this is a very useful book for those in the situation. And for the rest of us who care - it's simply enlightening and interesting!	2004-08-08

I was disturbed by the reality of our life. What's wrong with us adults..?<br />This is not so much about the pregnancy or the birth. 17-year-old Kate is secretly pregnant and her younger sister, Tyler, delivered the baby. That concludes early in the book. So does the half-mystery of \\"who's the father and why the secret\\". (I won't spoil)<br />But this is more about the events that happened and how the people involved responded to them, which eventually resulted in the sad mess. The girls' mother, Diedrie, succumbed to breast cancer two years ago. Their father, Davis, broken, couldn't stay in the house because he misses her so much. So most of the time the girls are left alone in the house, tending to themselves. Fear of total abandonment and potential repercussion made Kate decided to keep the baby a secret inspite of the health risks.<br />When the secret is uncovered, also quite early in the story, the rest of the book moves from one character to another - pondering about what each has overlooked, selfishly neglected, misunderstood, mistakenly acted, and the consequences of it all. Somehow it revolves around the dead Diedrie and her untimely death.<br />I hope we learn something from stories like this.<br />I have to say that Inclan's writing is almost extraordinary. Characters are developed well, nevermind how hopelessly pathetic but unfortunately realistic they are. She's able to present to us the deep thoughts, fragile emotions, and hidden subconsciousness of the characters. This kind of storytelling only books can deliver.	2004-06-01

Sometimes I do feel I want a baby more than a husband. And it strikes true when the heart rules against the sensible mind - wanting so much for the perfect one (a perfect someone for me, not the perfect man). You want to kick her and knock her head, and yes I want to kick myself too. But OK, don't judge me for that.<br />Berg seems to know how it all feels and and she describes the emotions well. Her language is awesome and so very true.<br />However, I have to say the storyline could be better. Certain things seem to be too convenient making it much less interesting.<br />I'm thinking of reading her other books.	2004-04-20

How many times we hear parents say \\"I wish you're more like your brother!\\"? Every child is different and each should be treated differently accordingly. This book explains how they differ, and guides us on how to more effectively deal with it. Parents could also avoid unnecessary or even damaging reaction/treatment to the differences.<br />Since the personality of an individual is innate, recognizing it in a child is easier. And critical. It is beneficial to start early in harnessing the potential - sharping the good side of it, and smothering the negative one. Make the best of the different personality.<br />Emotional health developed during childhood has great impact throughout a person's life. I think it would be a loss not to read this book.	2004-03-16

Here's Briony, a 13-year old girl, with creative imagination and the talent of writing. The elder siblings are back for the summer. Come the cousins from a troubled family; an enterpreneur guest; and a long-time friend who increasingly seemed to be crazy and scary. Events are cleverly built up to the center of story. It was such a tragedy when Briony's complex messed with the adult world. What a heart-breaking turn of events!<br />Contemplative issue.<BR>How long does it take to atone?

The story is full of interesting, lovable characters. The narrator is Scout a bright, bold, young girl who lived with her older brother Jem and their lawyer father, Atticus.<br />Respectable Atticus was a gentleman who raised the two children with the help from Calpurina, the day cook. Against some of the prevalent social senses, he taught them the principles and values he lived by. <br />With Dill around during the summer, things were more interesting. They had the hermit neighbor who remained the mysterious subject of the children's acts of curiosity. Their interaction with other neighbors like Ms Maudie and Mrs Dubose was always capped with lessons to learn.<br />And there was a case of a black man Atticus defended against the charge of raping a white girl.  Atticus' integrity and the people's classic prejudices were demonstrated in events related to the case.<br />The storyline and language are awesome. Narrations by children are always interesting in the way curiosity, frankness, and innocence do. And the book is full with values we adults could always relearn.

There she learned first-hand how brutal and inhumane Israel oppressed the Palestinians - things the media had failed to tell the world.  <br />When she returned to Britain, she didn't stop there. She set up the charity organization, Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), and return to Beirut a few more times within a few years.<br />She tells the story of the Sabra-Shatila massacres 1982, the Ramadan war 1985, and the Bourj el-Brajneh 1986-87 seige.

Heartrending	This is the first time I read a book about Muhammad (pbuh). This book is rather comprehensive, chronologically covering the historical background up until the demise of Muhammad. This includes: <BR>- overview of the Ka'ba, Mecca, and the Quraysh<BR>- Muhammad prior to the First Revelation<BR>- the early days of Islam in Mecca<BR>- the migration to Medina<BR>- the battles of Badr, Uhud, Trench<BR>- the treaty of Hudaybiyah<BR>- the spread of Islam<BR>- the conquest of Mecca<BR>- the return to Medina<br />The events were told entwined with the verses as they happened - providing a good brief background to the verses.  The story-telling is nice and easy, sometimes direct and matter-of-factly yet heart-rendering.  The language is a bit archaic, but understandable.<br />A bonus for me is that the book provides some understanding of the cultural practices of that time and place, as well as references such as the family tree of Muhammad, (consisting of key people), and the map of the Arabia during that time. So it greatly helps me comprehend some of the things that seem foreign, such as the practice of sending babies to suckling mothers. I still struggle to identify the many different characters especially when it comes to the customary \\"Abu\\" and \\"Umm\\" names, though :-)<br />In short, this is a very good book on the subject. It made me appreciate the wonders of the Prophet, his Companions, and their tireless struggles. I intend to read other books on the subject as well.	2003-10-10

It explores some of the questions that usually concerns people who approach religion intellectually and answers them with impressive explanation not lacking spirituality itself. It's a balanced combination of faith and reason. Lang tries to address some questions considered taboos in the traditional Muslim minds, and discusses them according to his understanding. Compelling.<br />The book explains about the fundamentals of Islam and how the very basic of the tenets work together to provide a comprehensive guidance to the believers. Understanding the concepts and the virtues makes them more meaningful to practising Muslims. Very interesting. He stresses on the need to approach the Islamic practices for their universal values while adhering to the path, instead of taking everything literally without considering the applicability in the current context and situation. Pretty thought-provoking.<br />Lang talks about some of the things he found prevalent in Muslim communities, which either weaken themselves or even contradict the teachings of Islam. He suggests some actions to take in order to put Islam as the moving forces to the existing communities as well as the truthful way to be projected to new converts and to the non-Muslims.<br />I'm born Muslim, and indeed it is a humbling read. Although I'm not an American nor am I a resident, I lived in Ann Arbor in mid-90s. Some of the things he speaks of can be applied elsewhere too. <br />All in all, I'm very satisfied reading it.

So this is not her whole life, but wow.. what an amazing story!<br />A girl is blind and deaf, and I would probably give up on her. But I'm ashamed of myself for that. Helen Keller was deaf and blind and yet this didn't stop her. She's bright and strong-headed. The power of self-determination combined with the great help from the wonderfully patient teacher in Anne Sullivan opened the door for her. Her desire to communicate with people, and her passion to \\"be normal\\" made her who she had accomplished to be.<br />How did she \\"listen\\"? How did she \\"speak\\"? How did she write? She did all that and was good at them. Astonishingly unimaginable. And with such a kind heart, she could easily make a more complete person that we \\"normal\\" people can.<br />\\"Helen sees more with her hands that we do with our eyes.\\"<br />Simply admirable.	2003-05-23

I feel sorry for him to so badly want to love God he somehow got it messed up.  The inter-faith dialog incident is simply hillarious!<br />Then the misadventure... what an amazing one. Pi ended up in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific ocean.. with a number of zoo animals.  His perseverance and endurance for survival against not only the sea but also the fierce, dangerous animals are candidly written and and elaborated in details. His knowledge gathered as a son of a zoo owner proves handy, and helped him beat the odds many times.. really fascinating.  And this is from someone who doesn't like animals!  There's sufficient elements of surprise and a nice touch of curiosity for me to keep turning the pages.<br />A book with very good story-telling to carry us along with the amazing tale.

Legal turns took place and for all the struggles and fights, the bruises and triumphs, he came to realize that Keefer's interest was the most important thing.<br />It exemplifies how a baby can change people's lives - physically, mentally, and emotionally; and how a family stand together for each other.<br />This book made me feel for the characters - their sorrow, anger, gratitute, relief, happiness and everything in between.  The details are the essence. It also made me see many aspects of adoption from inside.<br />Family stories can be too familiar sometimes, but the storyline of this book is compelling and captivating.

SOUL LOVE is the ultimate love, according to Kingma. Search within yourself, acknowledge what you really need, believe in the agenda of the soul, and you'll see the way. <br />This is a good book to help us console ourselves.<br />On the other hand, this book also challenges what most people believe in - social norms and expectations that seem to put things in order.

US	37150176	R13W63Z9BH1UEY	014028155X	897584228	Mendel's Dwarf	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Unusual but Interesting	4 stars because this is quite an unusual novel, what with the added footnotes on some of the genetic traits.  Unique.<br />Being a dwarf, Dr Lambert is practically a lonely person.  A celebrated scientist, but beyond his profession, he retreats into his own cave.<br />His thoughts are illustrated in such a frank manner they can be sarcastic, pitiful, yet bold.  The writing teases our curiosity and plays with our own perceptions.  We get to read deep into his feelings and empathize in the process, although Dr Lambert is proud enough not to keep feeling sorry for himself.<br />Recommended for people who would like something different both in the style of the writing and in the perspectives offered by the storyline.	2002-08-18

Nonetheless, I bought the book because I had been asking myself the same question.<br />If you're looking for some possible answers to the question yourself, bear with his preaching.  Some truths are indeed hard to swallow.  Yes, I laughed a lot at myself reading his sharp bullets.  And he's funny too.  The author provides simple, direct, and unpopular suggestions.  Take it or leave it.  I got tired with some of the ideas presented repetitively, but it's probably for emphasis.<br />A bit orthodox, of course.  But definitely a must read for people who are wondering about the same thing.  You never know what you'll discover.  Sometimes his points echoed in my mind just when I was looking for something. I kept the book for reference when in need!	2002-07-20

Some people may reject the idea of being generalized for fear of losing their individual uniqueness.  But the idea is to acknowledge the advantages of such generalization and at the same time to be aware of variations within the individual categories.<br />And this book tremendously helps us to understand how we are different from others, and how we can understand the differences.  Understanding is a bliss.<br />It also provides some suggestions to appreciate our strengths, while also knowing our weaknesses and working on them.<br />A must read for our peace of mind in general.  And to save us unnecessary problems arising from personality conflicts.	2002-07-20

Such a heart-breaking memoir, we can feel the sadness and frustrations.  The language was uniquely simple although can be confusing until we understand his style.  Frank and funny, I couldn't help wondering how he could be so matter-of-factly about the sorry state of the childhood.  But that's life.<br />A very good book for the simple pleasure of reading and getting your heart captured.<br />I haven't seen the movie said to be so-so.  But as they say.. don't judge the book by its movie.	2002-07-20
US	37150176	R4K1YJ5VA3PGI	0684847248	962464879	The Road Less Travelled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth	Books	4	4	5	N	N	A Very Good Book	This book caught my attention because somehow I cross upon some people reading it, or mentioning it in delight.  So I finally bought myself one.<BR>Indeed, it's a very good book.  It shows how we can see things differently.  Too many 'acceptable', expected norms in our lives are actually destroying our minds and souls.  Only if we have the courage to defy them.  Hence the LESS TRAVELED.<BR>And it explains why certain many things do not meet the eyes.. how our very subconscious manifest itself, sometimes against our conscious, in many ways.<BR>If you're looking for something to help you get a fresh, great outlook in life, consider this book.  I'm glad I did.  It sure enrich my mind.	2002-03-12

Such a profound story-telling and believable plot I had suspected that this is a true story.  It wrenched my heart to read some of the parts - when The God of Small Things was brutalized, and when Estha was parted from Mother.<br />Anyway, the language confused me a lot, probably because of the context and culture I'm not really familiar with.  The story got better as I went along.  Also interesting to read how things are as seen by the twin.  Frank and sometimes funny, but always delightful<br />I read the book twice just to recapture the enjoyment of reading it.	2002-03-01
US	37150176	R3A8STR599LB4L	0671510053	357229344	The Shipping News	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Disappointing	I simply bought the book a few years back because of the Pulitzer prize.  The book starts off with interesting, non-ordinary points.  However, it gets boring, what with the uncommon, if existing, words.  After some chapters, it was abandoned because it was no longer appealing to me.  I only continue reading it because of the upcoming movie.  Of course I would hate it if I see the movie without finishing the book.<BR>Maybe the expectation is raised because of the award, so it suffers the disappointment.  Her sentences are unique, OK, but it's not fair for people who do not expect such complex prose-writing in the first place.	2002-02-20
