This author focuses on Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, who have been growing quickly in recent years. In the past decades mosques &amp; temples have been poping up all over, even in the most Christian parts of this country.

I wanted to know more about the countries that some of my ancestors called home and their traditions (especially religious) Unfortunately, although this book was easy to read, the author seemed to bash Eastern Europe. For me, it was saddening. I wanted to know more about my history and didnt find anything too pretty in this book. Maybe the truth just hurts, but I am moving on to some other books about Eastern Europe and Orthodoxy to get another opinion. This was disappointing as the first book I read on Eastern Europe. The author did work hard though, and I did learn at least one side of the story, so I have to give some credit.	2001-06-18

I couldnt find another History book on Irish culture like it. One of my major in studies is World Cultures, although I found some misrepresentations, the majority of facts seemed accurate, from what I have studied. I am not Irish nor do I have any special study in Irish Culture. This is, as another reviewer noted, a history book you actually want to keep reading. Nice reading, but I would use this book as a beginner book on Irish Culture/History and follow up with another book. (just to compare notes)A great book for anyone with Irish blood to pick up, and discover why they should be proud of their roots, and get a feel for who their ancestors were.	2001-06-18

I learned a lot of interesting facts about Orthodoxy, although this book doesnt go into Orthodox history deeply. A handful of campus ministers search for the true church, and find their home in The Orthodox Church. I recommend reading a book about Orthodox history along with this book.

The book contains stories of Christian martyrs from biblical times to modern day, as well as a section about Christian persecution in other countries, and what we can do. I found it to be someone one sided, more of a Protestant book, as other Christian sects, Catholicism &amp;Orthodoxy didnt really get much of a say in this book. The information in the book was very helpful, and lets one see that Christians arent always the ones persecuting. In other countries where Christians are the minority, we get more than our share of ridicule.	2001-06-18

The author did an  excellent job compiling information from many sources, not just LDS, to  make his point. He glorifies the bible, and brings truth to the Book of  Mormon.  This book will help a non-member see how The Church of Jesus  Christ of Latter Day Saints is a biblically Christian religion.
