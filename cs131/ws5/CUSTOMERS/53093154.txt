J. Jacobs, a Jewish New Yorker in his mid-thirties who has decided to spend five hours a day for about a year reading the 2002 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, all 33,000 pages, 65,000 articles and 44 million words of it. His aim : humbly to become the smartest man in the world or, as he more honestly admits, to « get some fun facts, have something to say at cocktail parties, increase my quirkiness factor, maybe learn a little about the nature of information » (p361.)<br /><br />Raised on MTV and E !, sitcoms and celebrity biographies, and working as editor for a trendy magazine for men, Jacobs seems to approach his 32 volumes with an enthusiasm for breadth (if you arrange them on a bookshelf) or height (if you pile them up), but none for depth, except for the snippets of wisdom he likes to gather to give himself an alibi (all of them summarized in the last paragraph of the book), and just as much for structure, which he does not seem to consider a fundamental characteristic of the cosmos we live in (in his most mystical moment, he sees the world « as a collection of moving, pulsating, caroming facts. »)<br /><br />His selections of EB trivia tend to focus on sex, feces, counterintuitive information and the more sensationalistic science and history that make it to the documentary channels (such as « unusual expirings » and « absurd wars »), while his views on the bigger issues, even more than halfway into the alphabet, are remarkably shallow. Religiously speaking, he defines himself as an agnostic (his first book was about « the eerie similarities between Jesus and Elvis »), but he observes that « it is cool that Judaism allows you to have sex...  there is wisdom in Judaism- so I'll just pick and choose the parts I like and hope I don't go to Jewish hell. » Economically speaking, even though he labels himself a « capitalist » (which he seems to define as someone who enjoys the benefits of the affluence society), he believes man has created poverty and capitalism is somehow responsible for third-world famines.<br /><br />About two-thirds into his quest, he seems to realize it is not getting him where he initially thought it might : « I'm still having a hell of a time processing all this information, figuring out what it means. I can't see the forest for the trees.... I'm looking for answers- and there are answers... The problem is there are too many answers, thousands of them, and they all seem to conflict with one another... I want a guide, someone to tell me this is right, this is wrong » (not Jesus of course, but then maybe Elvis ?) And by the last entry in the encyclopaedia, Zywiec, he is left with « a weird and anticlimactic feeling » and the sad realization that « at this moment, I've got more information than I ever will. »<br /><br />I did not read *The Know-It-All* for its humour, though I enjoyed some of it, but for guidance, as someone who has been contemplating reading his own encyclopedia- though not to compete in some TV Quiz Show, outdo my father and/or stepbrother (both of whom are very similar to the author's), enter Mensa or write a money-making book about the experience. I was curious as to the life-changing potential of such a mammoth undertaking, as to the maturity, breadth of vision and genuine knowledge it might impart.<br /><br />But the author does not seem to receive much of these benefits through his trek across the EB, though he does manage to « clutter his attic », to borrow the Holmesian metaphor he is fond of. I tell myself maybe he did not do it the right way. Maybe he should have done some preliminary reading, to acquire some structure on which to hang his newly acquired knowledge. Maybe he should have adopted a lifestyle more consistent with his quest. Maybe he should have reformed what he calls his « still-adolescent mind » so as to enter the project with a more discriminating filter. Maybe he should have worked on method in ways more productive than speed-reading and memory-improvement seminars. Maybe the EB gives more to those who have than to those who have not...<br /><br />*The Know-It-All* has not convinced me that it is an altogether silly idea to read a good encyclopaedia in alphabetical order. As Jacobs informs us, not just fashionable journalists do that, and his more illustrious predecessors (men like George Bernard Shaw, C. S. Forester or Richard Feynman) may have owed some of their genius to their completion of the quest. However, there are serious contenders to the endeavour, like Britannica's own Great Books series or John A. Hardon's *Catholic Lifetime Reading Plan* (more of a list, actually), into which I have already dipped with some profit, and which I hope some day to confront with the kind of determination Jacobs teaches by his example.<br /><br />(NB : As the School Library Journal considers the book suitable for high school pupils, parents might like to be informed that the author is very liberal in his use of the F-word, among others, and makes very casual remarks about his own masturbatory activities and consumption of « recreational » drugs.)ethod in ways more productive than speed-reading and memory-improvement seminars.

A. A. Long's *Epictetus* belongs to the latter category : it is the perfect introduction to the thought of Roman Stoic philosopher Epictetus (c.50- c.130) and what little has survived of it (I was particularly distressed to learn that  what I knew as his Discourses are only about half of the original text, as only four of the original eight books have survived.) <br /> <br />A leading proponent of Late Stoicism (the phase of Stoics during the Roman Empire (19)), converted by his teacher Musonius Rufus, Epictetus may well be the most attractive figure of the movement. Unlike Seneca, he was a practicing teacher (11) and had no fascination with suicide (204.) And unlike Marcus Aurelius, he was not involved in the persecution of Christians (In his brilliant *The Founding of Christendom*, historian Warren Carroll writes that Marcus Aurelius would never have approved the hellish tortures inflicted on the martyrs of Lyons in 177, yet they were inflicted on his authority (p488.)) <br /> <br />Moreover, contrary to the pantheism of most members of the school, he had a personalist conception of God (21) which makes his thought much more germane to the worldview of modern Christians, as this tends to replace the point of view of the [impersonal] universe cherished by Aurelius with a much more benevolent and purposive divine point of view as a frame of reference (205.) Epictetus's understanding of Providence and of the Natural Law should also appeal to modern conservative Catholics. As for his saying that No one is free who is in error (108), it finds a clear echo in its more famous converse :  the Truth shall make you free. <br /> <br />Long shows how central Epictetus's concept of God was to his whole philosophy. The structuring principle of the entire universe, God was the ultimate role model for the Stoic sage, the paradigm of the virtues humanbeings are equipped to achieve (145.) He is rational perfection itself, and understanding Him and His plan is a prerequisite for understanding our duties : our reasoning powers and moral sense are an `offshoot' of the world's divine governor, whose cosmic order is a pattern for the harmony we should try to replicate in our thoughts and actions (26.) Even to grasp the Stoic ideal of the life according to nature requires that we focus our lives on God : the nature that interests [Epictetus] is exclusively animate, under which he includes not only human beings and other animals but first and foremost God (143.) To live `in accordance with nature' is to play one's specific part within the structure of the divine plan (174.) <br /> <br />As the subtitle of the book indicates, Epictetus was not only a Stoic, but a disciple of Socrates. Long even goes so far as to say that he appropriates Socrates more deeply than any other philosopher after Plato (8), making him more prominent than any other predecessor, including the Stoic Zeno and the Cynic Diogenes (57.) Devoting a whole chapter to this influence, Long counts no less than 100 references to Socrates in the extant corpus, and claim that Epictetus knew Plato's *Gorgias* more or less by heart (70.) <br /> <br />In a fascinating glimpse of student life under the Stoic master, Long tries to reconstruct the kinds of readings that would have supplemented the lectures, which would have been addressed to students 18 to 25. He helps the reader understand Epictetus's teaching methods by identifying three distinct styles : protreptic (or exhortative, admonitory, giving advice and displine on making progress as a Stoic (61)) ; elenctic (or Socratic, challenging and correcting beliefs and emotional attitudes (id.)) ; and didactic (or doctrinal.) And he fleshes out the three successive fields of study in the Stoic curriculum : the regulation of desires and aversions, ethics and, last but not least, logic. The idealsage was not only to have reached apatheia, but also to possess a skill in logic so powerful that he would be immune from the slightest risk of error (117.) <br /> <br />Epictetus's ambition as a teacher was to provide his students with a systematic plan of life that would, ideally, assure purposefulness, serenity, dignity and social utility at every waking moment, irrespective of external circumstance (20.) He did so by stressing the need to care for nothing but what is up to us, i.e. our rationality and our moral character. By his careful and sympathetic treatment of this powerful ideal, A. A. Long's book provides a golden opportunity for modern readers to make their first steps on this path. <br /> <br />Another reference on the same subject is A. F. Bonhffer's *The Ethics of the Stoic Epictetus*, but it is a much less accessible work than Long's, containing as it does much untranslated Latin and Greek. Also highly recommended is Richard Sorabji's *Emotions and Peace of Mind* (2000.)  <br />	2004-12-30

Are they felt movements occasioned or caused by our judgements, as held by the founder of the Stoic school, Zeno of Citium ? Are they our mistaken judgements themselves, accompanied by felt movements, as argued by his successor, Chrysippus ? Or do they sometimes originate in some irrational part of the self, as claimed by Posidonius, «the Stoic who deliberately reverted to Plato's tripartite psychology» ?<br /><br />Should we eradicate them, as most Stoics and some Church Fathers advocated, or should we merely moderate them, as the Aristotelians and most Church Fathers held ?<br /><br />And what methods of control and/or eradication are available to us ? What works and what does not ? Is it sufficient to reappraise the situations we are confronted with as indifferent and to consider it inappropriate to react emotionally to them, as Chrysippus taught ? Should our emotions be purged by catharsis as Aristotle believed ? Or should we play them off against each other in order to get rid of unwanted moods, as the Christian Desert Father Evagrius recommended ? Are some aspects of emotion- the so-called «first movements»- unavoidable, as modern neurophysiology seems to prove ? And do they pose a threat to the Stoic program of eradication, or can they be meaningfully defined away as non-emotions ?<br /><br />These are some of the highly challenging questions Richard Sorabji, Professor of Ancient Philosophy at King's College London, addresses in this sweeping survey of classical theories of emotions and emotional control, from Plato to St Augustine.<br /><br />The author himself is not a Christian : he rejects the doctrine of Original Sin, which he quaintly describes as «dear to Jerome and Augustine» ; defends «models of marriage more favourable [ ?] than Augustine's, for example Plutarch's» (which is presented as more « romantic » and as seeing «sex as a treaty whose renewal enables you to put up with the annoyances of daily living») ; and regrets the Pelagians did not win the «political battle» for orthodoxy against St Augustine. But though he evinces the modern scholarly antagonism to the latter's view of lust, he does recognize him as «a philosopher for whose genius I have repeatedly expressed my admiration.»<br /><br />Neither is Sorabji a Stoic. But he goes so far as to admit that «the case against eradication [of the emotions] is not so obvious as one might take it to be at first», which has the merit of turning a modern prejudice back into an open question.<br /><br />The book will be of interest both to historians of ideas, who seek to understand how (mostly Stoic) Pagan views of emotion were developed and enriched across the centuries, and how they were absorbed into and reformulated by the Christians of the Patristic age ; and to anybody who has begun to question the appropriateness of having whatever emotions he happens to have and aspires to a more ordered affective life.<br /><br />Though dense, highly detailed and occasionally very technical (as in its 20-page analysis of the formation of the modern concept of will), *Emotions and Peace of Mind* is a very accessible book which spares the reader untranslated quotations or terms. Whatever Greek or Latin words are used in the text are always well-defined and/or translated, and it is very easy to get along by jotting down a short glossary of less than a dozen recurrent Stoic terms (like horme, oikeiosis, proairesis or akrasia.)<br /><br />Another recently published treatment of Stoicism I highly recommend is A. A. Long's *Epictetus : A Stoic and Socratic Guide to Life*.the Pelagians did not win the political battle for orthodoxy against St Augustine.

US	53093154	R2EOTBOLF59HNR	0520243862	751883435	The Case for Animal Rights	Books	3	15	28	N	N	Overlong, out of focus and dangerous, but still recommended	What surprised me the most about this new edition of Tom Regan's 1983 classic \\"The Case for Animal Rights\\" is how little of the book bears directly on the animal issue: while chapters 1 through 3 are concerned with such questions as whether animals are conscious, have beliefs and desires, and can be considered to have a welfare; and the last chapter deals with the application of Regan's moral philosophy to the treatment of animals, the great bulk of the book (chapters 4 through 8, more than half of the volume) is devoted to what I understand modern philosophers call \\"meta-ethics\\", i.e. the kind of thinking one has to engage in before one actually gets to the point and starts fleshing out actual moral principles and rules. <br /> <br />This discrepancy between what the title announces and what the book actually focuses on is all the more annoying as Regan keeps avoiding what appear to be highly relevant issues by claiming they \\"fall outside the scope of the volume\\", so much so that one almost feels now and then that he is using animal rights as a selling point for a book whose main preoccupation is flogging the dead horse of utilitarianism (or as an excuse for the cute Durer rabbit on the cover.) <br /> <br />\\"The Case for Animal Rights\\" does have its virtues, though, if you are prepared to be patient with its inordinate length and ad hoc redefinitions of its scope. First, its \\"rights view\\" approach to the animal problem is an improvement over Peter Singer (a.k.a. Dr Death)'s utilitarian defense of animal welfare, the many flaws of which Regan convincingly points out. And second, the fine-grained conceptual distinctions Regan develops do help the reader clarify his thinking on the issues raised, though he himself misses a few distinctions he should have made (his attack on what he calls the \\"innocence principle\\" for instance ignores the principle of double effect and therefore targets a straw man.) <br /> <br />However, I was very dissatisfied with several points ofthe book. For instance, Regan claims his approach is not anti-human. But this is belied by his (Darwinian) assertion that humans are in no fundamental way different from the beasts, and that some beasts are actually superior to some humans (any belief to the contrary being \\"speciesist\\" and based on \\"prejudices... insulated by... religious beliefs.\\") <br /> <br />I also found Regan's attack on what he calls \\"perfectionist\\" ethics (according to which \\"what individuals are due, as a matter of justice, depends on the degree to which they possess a certain cluster of virtues or excellences\\") to be based on nothing more than a politically correct, leftist penchant for egalitarianism, and an inability to recognize that the two kinds of system are not mutually exclusive, but complementary. Classical liberalism for instance, is politically egalitarian and economically perfectionist. (Perfectionism is then redefined p325 to give it much more unsavoury connotations, perhaps because Regan himself felt he had a weak case against it.) <br /> <br />Most objectionable of all is the idea that \\"the harm that death is, is a function of the opportunities for satisfaction it forecloses\\" (p324.) Though this enables Regan to reassert that humans are generally more worthy to live than beasts (since they can enjoy types of satisfactions that elude even our closest mammalian cousins) and can therefore throw the odd dog out of the lifeboat, it is a huge step back from the Christian respect for the sanctity of human life, all the more so as this position is compatible with the idea that \\"the death of a normal, adult animal is... a greater harm, than the death of a less aware, retarded human\\" (p314.) <br /> <br />\\"The Case for Animal Rights\\" is not the definitive treatment of the subject I expected it to be. While it presents itself as *the* \\"rights view\\" on the issue, it is only a rather idiosyncratic approach within that category, one that will not fit a Christian framework without major modifications. However, though I am very concerned with the potential consequences of some of Regan's more objectionable principles, I think it is a step in the right direction, given that the natural law tradition is utterly deficient on the issue, and modern defenses of animal welfare had so far been made from points of view utterly inimical to this tradition.	2004-11-22

Morton is the author of two excellent self-published books on the subject of man's origins that strive to be both scientifically and \\"biblically\\" accurate: \\"Adam, Apes and Anthropology\\" (1997) and the present volume, \\"Foundation, Flood and Fall\\". <br /> <br />\\"Foundation, Flood and Fall\\" is divided into two parts. The first half, entitled \\"The Traditional View\\", is a scientific refutation of YEC (young-Earth creationism) and global Flood theories, based mostly on geological arguments, such as the analysis of varves, cyclical annual deposits that reflect the alternation of the seasons, or the structure of the fossil record, which turns out to be very different from the predictions of the \\"hydrodynamic sorting\\" model put forward by Flood theorists. <br /> <br />One of the most startling conclusions of this section, based on the data on modern genetic diversity (as measured by the number of known alleles for specific genes) and the estimated rate of DNA mutation, is that the \\"genetic bottleneck\\" posited by anthropologically universal Flood scenarios cannot have occurred less than 600,000 years ago. And since modern paleoanthropologists seem to agree that modern humans appeared only 150,000 years ago at the southern tip of Africa, this would mean that Noah couldn't have been a homo sapiens, nor a fortiori could Adam and Eve. <br /> <br />Having refuted YEC, the possibility of a global Flood and five more or less \\"literal\\" interpretations of Genesis 1 prevalent in fundamentalist circles, Morton then offers his own exegesis of Genesis 1 and his own Flood theory in part II, \\"The Novel View.\\" <br /> <br />Morton's interpretation of Genesis 1 falls into the \\"Days of Proclamation\\" category: it posits that the six days actually refer to six 24-periods that preceded Creation, during which God declared what he was about to do, though not in the order he would do it. This interpretation has one single redeeming feature in my mind: it entails that Genesis 1 is totally irrelevant to scientific inquiry about what has happened since the Big Bang, making the \\"Days of Proclamation\\" theory superior to the other five interpretations Morton rejects. Other than that, I think it is both philosophically absurd (it is meaningless to speak of 24-hour periods prior to Creation or of a \\"time before time\\", as Morton does) and exegetically unwarranted: Morton claims that \\"Let there be...\\", an imperative referring to the act of proclamation, is grammatically distinct from \\"And there was...\\", a preterit referring to the act of creation, and assumes that the difference in tenses is textual support for his proclamation/ creation dichotomy. However, the subordinate clauses in the imperative are all introduced by verbs in the past tense: \\"And God said: Let there be...\\", which robs Morton's position of its main exegetical basis. <br /> <br />Much more stimulating (though, I believe, still false) is the author's original Flood theory. Though no longer a YEC, Morton still holds to the idea that the biblical Flood, though not geographically universal (which is a geophysical impossibility), must have been anthropologically universal (a premise I no longer hold to be true, especially after reading Davis Young's \\"The Biblical Flood.\\") Therefore, he is committed to the view that it must have occurred more than 600,000 years ago. (My current position is that it can't have, and therefore can't have been anthropologically universal.) <br /> <br />Morton's scenario (which he admits is just a scenario) is to have the Flood coincide with the filling of the Mediterranean basin 5.5 million years ago, an event of gigantic proportions that dwarves even that of the Black sea, another proposed real-world translation of the Flood which Morton rejects because it could not have been anthropologically universal. Eden therefore must have been located on the ante-diluvial, dessicated Mediterranean basin, and Adam, Eve and Noah must have been very primitive hominids, probably of the australopithecine variety. <br /> <br />This scenario, I believe, is false, and if it is the last fall-back position for an anthropologically universal Flood, its falsification would mean that the Deluge only destroyed part of humanity, or was just a story after all (though this would create problems with Mt 24:37, where Jesus apparently refers to \\"the days of Noah\\" as historical.) <br /> <br />One of the greatest difficulties of the theory, in addition to that of showing that australopithecines could be meaningfully considered as human (which Morton does his best to defend in this volume and in \\"Adam, Apes and Anthropology\\"), is that even if one admits that God could have privately revealed the facts to Moses or whoever wrote the Flood account, it seems inconceivable for oral tradition to have preserved the story over *millions* of years with an accuracy sufficient to explain the parallels between the Bible account and the Gilgamesh epic written centuries before. <br /> <br />In addition to these major flaws with Mr. Morton's thesis, the book suffers from many other problems, some of them attributable to the self-publication format, others to the author's Protestant approach, and yet others having to do with his tendency to find physicalist \\"translations\\" for every single entity or event mentioned in the Bible, to the detriment of the original, spiritual sense (for instance, he believes the fruit of the tree of knowledge must have contained some psychoactive substance similar to LSD, in order to explain why it affected both Adam and Eve's minds and their genes.) <br /> <br />However, all these errors and untenable theses do not make the book less than excellent. Particularly admirable are the author's iron-clad honesty, as reflected in his courageous abandonment of YEC at a high personal cost, his contagious enthusiasm for geology, and the boldness of his speculations, which reminded me of the best hard-science novels I have read. <br /> <br />Despite my dissatisfaction with the author's conclusions, I highly recommend this book as a well-informed and conscientious attempt to combine a conservative reading of the Bible with the latest findings of modern science. <br />	2004-09-08
US	53093154	R1KH83CWYPEEFM	1890740101	843779715	The Great Facade: Vatican II and the Regime of Novelty in the Roman Catholic Church	Books	3	56	91	N	N	Interesting data, some dubious positions	\\"The Great Facade\\" purports to be an expose of what has really been going on in the Catholic Church since Vatican II. Rejecting sedevacantism, its authors forcefully deny that the conciliar Popes have been heretics, since they do not seem to be guilty of any \\"obstinate post-baptismal denial or doubt of an article of divine and Catholic faith\\" (p12.) However, being pillars of The Remnant, a magazine that belongs to the hardest core of Catholic traditionalism, they denounce alleged \\"conservatives\\" as \\"right-wing liberals\\" who, by focusing their defense on a handful of essential doctrines, have tragically negotiated away an enormous amount of so-called \\"non-essentials\\", thereby letting the Church destroy its own immune system. <br /> <br />Ferrara and Woods' thesis, therefore, is that the Conciliar Chuch is not dead, it merely has AIDS : it is still the Catholic Church, since none of the \\"articles of divine and Catholic faith\\" have been rejected, but it is doing such a thorough job of self-destruction with the liturgical reform, the oecumenical movement and inter-religious dialogue that it has become necessary for true Catholics to \\"resist it to the face\\" and urge a \\"total restoration of the ecclesiastical and apostolic traditions ... and a return ... to the uncompromising Scholastic clarity and vigor of the preconciliar Magisterium\\" (p26.) <br /> <br />This whole position rests on the belief that the \\"postconciliar novelties\\" have failed to \\"rise to the level of formal, binding doctrine\\", thereby stopping short of heresy, but have merely gnawed away at \\"non-propositional\\" traditions. Heresy, say the authors, \\"is a propositional offense.\\" Therefore, so long as you have not \\"declared\\" anything and have merely misbehaved, which is what they hold the Conciliar Church to have been doing, you cannot be guilty of it. <br /> <br />This, I think, is a half truth. Orthodoxy implies orthopraxy, and conduct itself may be a sure sign of heresy. A friend of mine once told me that the Conciliar Church no longer believed in the real presence. This sounded extreme to me, for I have heard few explicit denials of this doctrine from Church officials (for instance, a priest from the Netherlands once said he did not participate in processions because he could not see the point of \\"walking behind a piece of bread.\\") But then my friend said : \\"Just look at the way they treat the Host.\\" That made me think. And if you do not find communion in the hand blatant enough, the authors of the book themselves have very good anecdotes about the way hosts are dealt with during the World Youth Days (p389.) <br /> <br />Another problem I have with the book is that it is not always fair to its opponents. For instance, quoting Ratzinger as saying that \\"Paul teaches not the resurrection of physical bodies but of persons\\" (p270), Ferrara and Woods launch into an indignant defense of the Catholic doctrine of bodily resurrection, as if Ratzinger had just denied it, while it seemed to me he had just been saying that Resurrection Day would not be a remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", that we would not be zombies or revivified meat, but true persons, i.e. minds integrated to bodies. <br /> <br />Third, I was also appalled by the two or three pages attacking the doctrine of evolution and the idea that modern humans are bodily descendants of pre-sapiens hominids. The authors suddenly turn sarcastic and very unpleasant towards the defenders of theistic evolution, mocking the \\"grotesquery that Adam (and Eve) had animal parents- which would mean that Christ himself is descended from animals\\" (p270.) I find this attitude irresponsible in the extreme, all the more so as Mr Woods, whom I greatly respect as an economist and an historian of ideas, has written articles condemning the social doctrine of the Church in the name of Austrian economics, and thus seems to respect the authority of science within its own sphere. I for one see nothing wrong with Jesus Christ being descended from australopithecines. After all, wasn't he like us in everything but sin ? <br /> <br />It might seem unfair of a reviewer to condemn a whole book for a mere three pages that might be considered peripheral to its main thesis. However, I am beginning to realize that virtually all the traditionalists I know of hold to Ussher-like chronologies and consider Adam to have been created from inanimate matter around 4000 BC, with the Deluge being a complete drowning of the globe in water. I do not know if this is what Ferrara and Woods actually believe, but this is certainly what their attacks on paleoanthropology seem to entail : if Adam did not have animal parents, and he was the first human, where could he possibly have come from, except a literal lump of clay? And this, I think, is not only anti-scientific, but anti-Catholic in its dogmatic self-certainty, since even such an orthodox , pre-Conciliar work as Ludwig Ott's \\"Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma\\" leaves open the position Ferrara and Woods laugh at. So is it truly the \\"preconciliar Magisterium\\" they want Catholics to return to, or some sinister collection of doctrines of their own concoction ? <br /> <br />To conclude, \\"The Great Facade\\" has failed to convince me that the Conciliar Church is historically continuous with the Catholic Church, though it has reinforced my belief that it has done a lot of evil ; and it has made me even more uncomfortable with Catholic traditionalism, as I realize its most vocal defenders are guilty of the same denial of reality as their Protestant counterparts- including those who, like Thomas Woods, are capable of perfectly rational thinking in their own scientific fields.	2004-09-04

The problem, as Davis Young remarks (px) is that the Bible is not self-interpreting: it must be, as it has always been, interpreted within a certain context of \\"extra-biblical knowledge\\", i.e. our knowledge of the world around us which, being God's work, has a lot to say about Him. <br /> <br />That context of extra-biblical knowledge, fortunately, has not stagnated since men first attempted to make sense of the Bible. It has kept expanding and expanding, as observations and improved theories have accumulated in such sciences as geology, biology or geography, requiring ever finer and more informed interpretations of the texts. <br /> <br />In the process, a Biblical book or passage that may rationally have appeared to be historical to some of the greatest minds of the Church may now be revealed to be nothing more than a story, and just as fictional as one of Jesus's parables, whose value does not depend on our finding the bones of the Good Samaritan or the well-preserved oil-lamps of the foolish virgins buried somewhere on mount Ararat. <br /> <br />Taking the story of Noah as an example of the way increasing extra-biblical knowledge has transformed our understanding of Scripture, Young does for it what Jaki did (less charitably perhaps, but with a sounder ecclesiology) for Genesis 1, retracing more than two millenia of intellectual perplexity and progress in order to shed light on modern controversies. <br /> <br />Young clearly shows how problematic certain interpretations have become in the light of what we now know of the way things work: for countless evidential reasons, none of which have to do with \\"the rationalistic preconceptions of recent centuries\\", or any bias inherent in modern science other than a fondness for keeping one's eyes open, a literal reading of the Noah story has become untenable, all the efforts of the Woodmorappes of the world to make the impossible look plausible notwithstanding. <br /> <br />The book is not without its flaws. Being a Protestant, the author seems to believe in a Frankenstein monster of a \\"church\\" consisting of the Catholic Church until 1517, and then of the collective body of Protestants after that date, seen as having some sort of organic unity and as being continuous with the pre-Reform Catholic Church, while virtually none of the members of the post-1517 Church are deemed worthy of intellectual discussion, let alone of inclusion in the list of the \\"premier minds\\" of \\"the church.\\" <br /> <br />Interestingly, when it comes to determining which aspects of the interpretation of the Bible are \\"non-negotiable\\", i.e. impervious to reinterpretation in the light of new evidence, Young has to fall back on pre-1517 decisions of the Catholic Church, since it seems hard to imagine how his patchwork \\"church\\" could ever produce any \\"settled interpretations\\" of its own (p308.) <br /> <br />That said, I highly recommend \\"The Biblical Flood\\" to anybody who wants to know what to think of the very vocal and self-assured defense made by certain modern Christians of a geographically or anthropologically universal Flood.	2004-09-01

Anthony Zimmerman's *Evolution and the Sin in Eden* is an attempt to revise and tone down the Catholic concept of Original Sin in order to give modern man a much more optimistic and relaxed vision of his condition. <br /> <br />Though the title suggests the book might be heavy on science, only the first four chapters are actually concerned with a confrontation of the doctrine of Original Sin with evolutionary science, with chapter 10 trying to integrate the concept of concupiscence with neurological data. The remaining two thirds of the book are mostly an examination of scriptural, patristic and conciliar texts. <br /> <br />To locate Adam and Eve on our evolutionary tree, Fr. Zimmerman follows a simple argument : to have been punished by God for their sin, Adam and Eve must have been responsible moral agents ; this requires logical thought, which in turn presupposes fairly advanced linguistic capacities, which were also a prerequisite for a meaningful dialogue with God. <br /> <br />Based on the theories on the emergence of language put forward by Philip Lieberman, who later wrote a book entitled *Eve Spoke*, Zimmerman concludes that Adam and Eve must have been homo sapiens, because earlier hominids like Habilis, Erectus and Neanderthal probably spoke too slowly ( perhaps one tenth  of our own speed, he speculates rather recklessly) to have had the required cognitive apparatus for sin. These hominids however probably did have eternal souls, whose fate he hopes was similar to that of unbaptized children. <br /> <br />Fr. Zimmerman therefore surmises that Adam and Eve were a couple of African homo sapiens who became isolated from the rest of the population between 140,000 and 290,000 years ago according to the recent findings on mitochondrial DNA. He seems to be unaware that the so-called mitochondrial Eve and the father(s) of her children cannot have been the sole parents of the human race, if we consider the genetic diversity existing today. As Glenn R. Morton shows in *Foundation, Flood and Fall*, even a historical group of eight survivors of an anthropologically universal flood would have to have lived more than 600,000 years ago to explain modern genetic diversity (p70.) In other words, even Noah could not have been a homo sapiens, since the genus appeared less than 200,000 years ago. (This in turn implies that if Zimmerman is right about the emergence of language and Morton is right about genetic diversity, Adam and Eve can't have existed.) <br /> <br />Having reached this rather unsatisfactory scientific conclusion, Zimmerman gives his own highly symbolic interpretation of Genesis. Eating of the fruit of the tree of good and evil means deciding for oneself what good and bad are, or treating good and bad alike. As for the tree of life, it symbolizes  what is positive and good , i.e.  God's grace.  Genesis 2 is therefore read as primarily a moral lesson, teaching us  that man the creature has an obligation to obey God.  <br /> <br />Two chapters are then devoted to a detailed examination of the debates of May-June 1546 that led to the canons of the Council of Trent concerning Original Sin (DS 787-792.) Here Zimmerman shows an unconscionable disregard for evidence. His own thesis is that Original Sin merely deprived Adam and Eve of sanctifying grace and did not affect their natures. However, Trent teaches that  Adam was transformed in body and soul for the worse , which Zimmerman tries to downplay using various specious arguments. For spurious  pastoral  reasons, he also wants to discredit the notion that bodily death is a consequence of original sin, which has been a Church dogma for centuries (Pius XI took it for granted in his 1929 Encyclical *Divini Illius Magistri*, cf. DS 2212) and is even presupposed in the first two canons of Trent on Original Sin, which speak of a death that is not spiritual only but physical also, since it is placed on the same level as  the punishments of the body.  <br /> <br />Perhaps even more questionable is Zimmerman's statement that  Trent does not teach that concupiscence started suddenly with original sin , for the Council asserted that concupiscence was  from sin  and Original Sin, as its name indicates, was the first sin. So how could concupiscence have started gradually before that ? <br /> <br />Zimmerman then tries completely to neutralize the concept of concupiscence, which he identifies with  our spontaneous and vigorous natural drives , i.e. a healthy sex drive, not an inclination to sin as defined by Trent. This to me seems similar to an error of Abelard's condemned by the Council of Sens (see DS 386.) <br /> <br />Another thesis of the book is that Paradise was not that paradisiacal. This is  folklore theology ,  an archaic view not accepted by outstanding theologians of today . Zimmerman claims that Adam and Eve's  nakedness without sin  was itself sinful, since nakedness always connotes  weakness... disgrace... punishment for sin  in Scripture. But this argument begs the question in that it generalizes the connotation of nakedness after the Fall to what obtained before, forgetting that Original Sin introduced a radical discontinuity in human history and that any such leap is unwarranted. <br /> <br />At bottom, Zimmerman considers Original Sin as  just another mortal sin , with no more effects on man's nature than any mortal sin today. <br /> <br />Much of the book is devoted to a refutation of St Augustine's very pessimistic theory of Original Sin, using the Humean neurology of the triune brain theory to show that Augustine's angelic Adam, who had  motor control  over his emotions, is a neurological impossibility :  Such an Adam would be a piece of biological junk.  He then explains that Original Sin merely  shattered [the] solidarity of the human race in the practice of virtue , forgetting that Adam and Eve were supposed to be the only humans on Earth and not symbols for an entire population, as he established in chapter 4, and talking of an  entire community ,  none of the members [of which] was ignorant of God.  <br /> <br />As an antidote to St Augustine, Zimmerman revives the theories of St Irenaeus, whom he considers to be a more reliable witness as he was much closer to Jesus than Augustine (being a disciple of St Polycarp, who received his doctrine directly from St John and the other Apostles.) Irenaeus viewed Adam as  a baby just learning to walk  (a metaphor that seems to contradict Zimmerman's initial stress on Adam's moral maturity in the early chapters of the book) and Original Sin as  an almost necessary stepfor the education of mankind.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, I fail to see in what way Zimmerman's own position avoids the heresy of Pelagianism, which he himself summarizes in chapter 15 :  The sin of Adam is not at all transmitted to descendants by some kind of inheritance... Descendents do indeed imitate Adam's sin... [D]eath and concupiscence are natural to humans, not a punishment for Adam's sin.  Isn't that precisely what Zimmerman has been arguing all along ? And doesn't this explain why he is so adamant to discredit Canon 1 of the Council of Carthage (a council that met precisely to condemn pelagianism, cf. DS 101-8) ? <br /> <br />Under the guise of a synthesis of modern evolutionary science with Catholic doctrine (a synthesis which I believe is sorely needed), *Evolution and the Sin in Eden* therefore seems to be an attempt to put forward a heretical understanding of Original Sin, bolstered by a biased and misleading use of sources. <br />	2004-07-28
US	53093154	R10E6G5FBFCF9U	0804201250	267035064	The Meaning of Creation: Genesis and Modern Science	Books	3	27	37	N	N	Syncretistic, modern approach throws out too much	Conrad Hyers's slim volume, *The Meaning of Creation*, attempts to put an end to the Creation / evolution debacle by offering a fresh but purportedly conservative approach to Genesis 1 and 2. <br /> <br />According to Hyers, the actual conflict is not between Creation and evolution (both of which can be and are true), but between two ideologies, both of which are false : atheistic evolutionism (dinosaur religion) and scientific creationism (religion as dinosaur.) Though it is neither good Bible nor good science (p20), the latter has sought to impose itself as *the* orthodox approach to Genesis, outside of which lies heresy. Its literalist demands have thereby been brought to the text, confused with the text, given the authority of the text, and absolutized along with the text, requiring the same allegiance as the text itself. (p23) <br /> <br />Even though they may seem to be diametrical opposites, these two ideologies share the same premise : a projection of modern science onto Scripture. Both substitute certain modern categories and concerns for those actually present in the biblical texts, and imagine ... that these contemporary problems are what the texts are about. (p8.) <br /> <br />Instead, Hyers offers what he considers to be a truly conservative approach to Scripture, one which actually tries to conserve ... the primary and original meaning of the text, in its own terms and historical milieu (p8.) Seen in this light, Genesis does not contradict science because it is shown to belong to a different literary genre, type of knowledge and kind of concern and therefore to have little to do with science : it is not concerned with what arch-Creationist Henry Morris ludicrously calls God's methods of creation, but with the ultimate source of ... being, meaning and direction (p33.) <br /> <br />Quite perceptively, Hyers remarks that under a show of strict adherence to the text, literalism actually misses the symbolic richness and spiritual power of what *is* there (p29), a flaw one encounters even in solid old-earth creationist writers like Glenn R. Morton. <br /> <br />To access that richness, we must understand Genesis as a *theological* picture of the universe, and the respective places of nature, humanity and divinity within the *religious* order of things (p38), a picture which attacks idolatry by demythologizing nature and showing the creatureliness of the sun, moon and stars deified by the Pagans. <br /> <br />Both scientific literalism and scientific symbolism must therefore be rejected in favour of religious symbolism. Genesis is a cosmological account, interested in God's imposition of order on chaos through the separation of entities from one another (p89.) In particular, it uses numbers numerologically, not numerically ; the six days are neither 24-hour periods nor geological eras, but a liturgical-calendrical model based on the sacred division of the week and the observance of the sabbath (p75.) <br /> <br />Hyers does not seek to reduce the Genesis accounts to a set of legends or fairy tales. He considers them to be myths, i.e. vehicles of supreme truth (p107), figurative expressions of the most basic and significant truths of all, which give meaning, purpose and value to existence (p104.) He does claim that stories such as Cain and Abel, the Flood, and the Tower of Babel ... have a strong historical base (p125), but when he actually spells out that base however, it turns out to be less than strong. For instance, Eve's first eating of the tree of knowledge, which led to farming and eventually to urbanization, may have some historical basis in the probable origins of agriculture in simple plantings by women (p101.)  Similarly, the flood story... is based in the flood experiences of the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys... It is quite possible that some people escaped into boats and took animals with them (p102.) <br /> <br />The serpent itself is seen as a personification of the Baal-worshipping Canaanites, leading Hyers to a far from Catholic interpretation of God's promise about Eve's seed : While Israel bruised the head of the Canaanites in conquest, the Canaanites continued to bruise the heel of Israel in corrupting its pastoral faith and desert virtues (p123.) <br /> <br />As for Biblical inerrancy, little is left of it after Hyers' remark that the Cannanites and their agricultural rites are given a long and dubious history (p124) as the descendants of Cain. <br /> <br />Much is made of the opposition between Genesis 1 (the Priestly account), which Hyers believes was composed in the 6th century BC (p51) and Genesis 2 (the Yahwist account), which is said to be from the Solomonic period (10th century BC) and is therefore much earlier. The latter reflects pastoral, nomadic values and is critical of the abandonment of the ways of the Patriarchs which followed settlement and urbanization, and more especially the corruption of monotheism through the cosmopolitan polygamy of the royal and palatial Solomon (p142.) <br /> <br />By combining the Priestly and Yahwist worldviews, Genesis... offers contrasting portraits of human existence : the urban and pastoral Adam and Eve, the royal couple and the servant pair... This very juxtaposition suggests that to acknowledge both sides of our Adamic nature is to be whole, to be fully human (p151-2.) The resulting text therefore avoids both cynic and promethean extremes. Indeed, the Priestly author, though positively related to civilization, is not a radical progressivist ; and the Yahwist, though critical of civilization and its evils, is not a radical primitivist (p162) <br /> <br />The last chapter of the book tries to defend a vision of Creation as a controlled accident, God using chance as part of the very process of Creation rather than controlling every single step. Creation is thus redefined as an artsy, avant-garde mix of design and arbitrariness (p181), a kind of jam session where God lets things happen as much as He makes them happen (p175), almost as if He wanted to be surprised by His Creation. <br /> <br />It is at this point that Hyers departs most from conservative positions, as he falls into some frankly blasphemous sort of feministic theology : Divine foreknowledge, let alone divine predestination, would have no absolute place in this vocabulary. These are masculine concerns, attributed to a masculine god (p175.) <br /> <br />*The Meaning of Creation* is at its best when trying to recapture the mindset of the inspired writers of Genesis, but it errs on the side of modernism in the interpretations it offers. It should therefore be read not as a final answer to the problem, but as an introduction to a more empathetic exegesis for all those whose minds are entrapped in scientific literalism. <br />	2004-07-27
US	53093154	R10BXUJSW6H7JF	1897713002	805052219	Genesis 1: Through the Ages	Books	5	23	23	N	N	Drawing the lesson from two millenia of exegesis	Stanley L. Jaki is a Hungarian-born Benedictine priest with doctorates in theology and physics, and the author of about forty volumes or so dealing mostly with the relationship of science and theology.<br />*Genesis 1 Through the Ages* is one of his more exegetical studies, along with *The Keys of the Kingdom: A Tool's Witness to Truth* and *And on This Rock: The Witness of One Land and Two Covenants*. His aim here is to survey two millenia of commentaries of Genesis 1 and offer his own interpretation in the last thirty pages or so. Potential readers of the book should be reminded that chapter 1 of Genesis, also known as the Hexaemeron, is only concerned with what is known as «the work of the six days». Fr. Jaki's work, therefore, has nothing to say about the creation of Eve from Adam's side, the Fall or the Flood, all of which are dealt with in the subsequent chapters of Genesis.<br />The survey itself is divided into eight chapters, beginning with the «Jewish sages» (from Philo and the Talmud to Maimonides, the Cabala, Spinoza and Umberto Cassuto) and concluding with the latest efforts of 20th century Christian scholarship, on which Jaki delivers a rather skeptical verdict : «On the one hand they claim that Moses, or whoever else, wanted to say something all-important about the totality of the physical realm, including himself, and in such a way as to be within the reach of simple fools. On the other hand, they portray Moses as one lost in myths and incredibly complicated schemes» (p256.)<br />Sandwiched between these two more or less chronological termini are chapters on the Patristic Age (which saw such a genius as Saint Augustine exclaim after years of work : «I collapsed under the weight of a burden I could not bear»), the Middle Ages, the Age of Reformers (where protestant exegetes like Luther and Calvin had to pay the price for «replacing the infallibility of the Church (and of the papacy in particular) with the infallibility of the Bible»), the New Age of Science (in which Descartes, Leibnitz, Buffon and Kant- a joke as a scientist, as Jaki is fond of showing- broke their teeth on the Six Days) and the Age of Cosmogenesis, when increasingly atheistic physicists failed to pay attention to James Clerk Maxwell's dictate that «one of the severest tests of a scientific mind is to discern the limits of the legitimate application of the scientific method.»<br />After teasing the reader for 260 pages or so, Fr. Jaki delivers his own interpretation of the Hexaemeron, trying to put it «at safe remove from ... the merciless grip of science» by rejecting the root error that thwarted its correct interpretation for two millenia: concordism, i.e. the projection onto the biblical text of «cosmogonies taken for the last word in science » (p42.) As he states bluntly, «there is no world-making whatsoever in Genesis 1 in the sense of a scientific cosmogenesis, however inchoate» (p260), thereby echoing the teaching given by Leo XIII in his 1893 Encyclical *Providentissimus Deus* that «the inspired authors did not mean to teach about the workings of nature» (p216, in Jaki's paraphrase.)<br />Serenely accepting that Genesis 1 is predicated on an obsolete vision of the world as a flat disk covered by the solid dome of the heavens and surrounded by the upper and lower waters, Jaki nonetheless manages to offer a non-mythical interpretation he considers «valid for all ages», based on exegetical clues found in such books as Jeremiah and the Psalms.<br />*Genesis 1 Through the Ages* follows the same kind of method as Jaki's excellent *God and the Sun at Fatima* (which convinced me that something truly miraculous did happen there on October 13, 1917- and that it did not involve the sun itself): a painstaking crawl through dozens upon dozens of documents to finally reach a clear and simple truth which nobody seems to have grasped before. My only reservation is that Jaki may be a little uncharitable in making dozens of history's greatest minds playWatson to his own Sherlock, leaving the reader with the impression that nothing worth reading on Genesis 1 was ever written between the 13th century BC and the present book.<br />But this, in my opinion, is a minor flaw when compared to the immense benefit one derives from understanding that the «six days» need not be interpreted in any of the several dubious ways concocted by the literalists, be it the traditional six-day view, the gap theory, the day-age theory, «progressive creation» or the days of proclamation theory (to use the classification proposed by Glenn R. Morton- himself a defender of the latter and by far the most innocuous- in *Foundation, Fall and Flood*.)<br />My mind at least is at rest, free to tackle the much thornier issues of monogenism, original sin and the Flood.	2004-07-12
US	53093154	R33HJOL8KGPAFI	1932589007	140262213	Origin of the Human Species	Books	2	30	42	N	N	Promising book undone by lack of method	Dr. Dennis Bonnette is a Catholic, a thomist and a theistic evolutionist. As such, I expected him to have written a masterful treatment of the subject of human evolution, enlightened by the magisterium of the one true Church, structured by the intellectual rigor of the best philosophical system I know of, and spared the necessity of ignoring or distorting scientific evidence which plagues all creationist writings. Those expectations were all the higher as *Origin of the Human Species* seems to have received almost nothing but glowing reviews.<br />Unfortunately, Bonnette is not particularly interested in what the magisterium of the Catholic Church has to say. He does devote one chapter to it, but it is awkwardly located (in the middle of the book), less than nine pages long, and mostly based on the decision of the 1909 Biblical Commission, with scanty references to the Council of Trent and Pius XII's encyclicals Humani Generis and Divino Afflante Spiritu.<br />Bonnette's thomism, moreover, seems to have been shaped to a large extent by the writings of a 20th century Australian philosopher, Austin M. Woodbury, whose books unfortunately exist only as unpublished manuscripts; and those of Jacques Maritain, whose very Kantian distinction between dianoetic and perinoetic knowledge Bonnette makes extensive use of to undermine the certainty of scientific knowledge.<br />As for the scientific validity of Bonnette's arguments, it is much undermined by his endorsement of Vedic scientists Michael Cremo and Richard L. Thompson, whose books try to rewrite the whole field of paleoanthropology by using allegedly suppressed evidence and various paranormal techniques such as past-life regression.  (Readers curious to learn more about Bonnette's attitude towards Cremo's books can read his own five-star reviews of two of them on this very site.)<br />Bonnette also claims that his evaluation of the emergence of intellect in man is «consistent with the work of anthropologist Thomas Wynn», but Wynn is not mentioned anywhere in the body of the text, the bibliography or the index, and I had to do a search on this site to learn that Wynn is the author of a 120-page study on «The Evolution of Spatial Competence» (1989.)<br />Summarizing his evaluation of the science in the first edition of the book, Glenn R. Morton (author of the very stimulating *Foundation, Flood and Fall* and *Adam, Apes and Anthropology*) wrote that «Bonnette's anthropological knowledge is positively paleolithic, the average age of his anthropological references being 1980 with only three references to the literature of the 1990s. Indeed, the average age of the scientific reference is 1978. Because of this, the book abounds with falsified claims.»<br />But perhaps the major flaw of the volume is its lack of method. Rather than a full-fledged book structured by an overall argument, with each chapter resting on what the previous chapters have established, *Origin of the Human Species* is much closer to being a collection of articles. Indeed, the longest and most praised chapter of the book, «The Significance of Recent Ape Language Studies» (with whose conclusions  I wholeheartedly agree) was initially published in 1993 as an article in the Christendom Press periodical *Faith &amp; Reason*.<br />The chapters themselves are often unstructured cacophonies of quotes from authors of various persuasions, generally leading to unconclusive assessments by the author. Chapter 1, for instance, on «Darwinian evolution versus scientific creationism» ends with Bonnette's willful suspension of judgment and a determination to leave to others the «ongoing great debate over the general scientific validity of biological evolution.» In chapter 14, Bonnette even confesses his fear that because of Cremo's work, his whole «effort might be in vain.»<br />Finally, the style is often atrocious, as Bonnette overuses the possessive case and noun determination and seems to be allergic to the definite article, creating such monstrous phrases as «gradualistic human intellective emergence» or sentences like «inability to determine presence of spontaneous movement or sense organs reveals present inability to make a definitive determination, not absence of a demarcation line within organisms» or «in alteration of DNA macromolecule genetic micro-structure, germinal material organization suffers confluence of two-fold agency». So much for the lucid and easily accessible language one of the reviewers praises. (To be honest, I must admit that these are the most horrid excerpts I came across and fortunately much of the book is better written.)<br />I am not saying that *Origin of the Human Species* is all bad. On the contrary, I am almost tempted to say that most of it is good. But a book should not be a grab-bag of truths, anymore than a military campaign should consist in roaming about in enemy territory and firing in all directions, which is more or less what this book feels like.	2004-07-10
US	53093154	R3H60FY2U5YIJX	0879735112	302246947	Evolution and Creation: A Catholic Understanding	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A clear, dispassionate and very accessible introduction	Published in 1986 by the Catholic editor «Our Sunday Visitor», *Evolution and Creation : A Catholic Understanding* is a 155-page introduction to the Creation/ evolution debate whose non-scholarly approach is justified by its intended readership: « those parents who must react wisely when their children return from school and announce that `the Bible is wrong'. »<br />The author of the book, Father William Kramer, C. PP. S., was then Professor of Chemistry at St Joseph's College in Rensselaer, Indiana, whence he retired in 2000. Ordained in 1944, Kramer seems to have had a lifelong interest in the Creation/ evolution debate, as the book recalls an argument he had on the subject as early as 1940. His own position is that of theistic evolution, which he defines as the idea «that a transcendent Being totally distinct from nature created the universe from nothing and causes it to develop according to the laws he designed into it » (p133.) A corollary of this position is a nuanced understanding of the inerrancy of Scripture, holding that «the Bible contains no error in what the sacred writer intended to teach. But he presents his message in popular language and stories which reflect the views of the people of the time. God did not correct [his] views of nature» (p6.)<br />The book is divided into eight chapters, the first of which narrates the «fundamentalist story», showing that fundamentalism is a distinctly 20th century, Protestant phenomenon, though it has also seeped into Catholic traditionalism. Kramer shows how eerily similar it is to the flat-earth movement Samuel Rowbotham launched in 1865, in its ill-advised and self-defeating assimilation of Christianity with a discredited scientific position, Darwin having replaced Newton as the scientific antichrist.<br />Chapter 2 is a systematic refutation of 33 creationist theses collected from the writings of Henry Morris, the modern Pope of creationism, most of which are shown to be «not direct evidence for ayoung earth but a possible difficulty arising from an old one», «possible» itself being a diplomatic adjective since all the objections are answered in a paragraph or two.<br />In Chapter 3, Kramer tries to clarify the debate by distinguishing three types of evolution (stellar, telluric and biological) and three understandings of the concept (as a natural process, a scientific theory and an ideology), spending the most time explaining and defending biological evolution by refuting such objections as the «missing link» argument or the argument from the second law of thermodynamics.<br />Chapter 4 demonstrates that the evil of evolution lies not in the science but in the ideology it has been turned into or in its recuperation by atheistic and materialistic ideologies such as Marxism. Amusingly, Kramer explains that Marx offered Darwin to dedicate *Das Kapital* to him, but Darwin refused. <br />After a short and rather weak chapter dealing with the philosophical concepts of design and chance (a chapter which begs the question since it virtually equates structure or identity with design), Kramer summarizes the Catholic response to evolution from the First Vatican Council to John Paul II, giving an overview of the thinking of Catholic theologians like Gerald Molloy, Herman Schell, Teilhard de Chardin, Ernest Messenger, Ernesto Cardinal Ruffini, Raymond Nogar, Karl Rahner and Hubertus Mynarek, more than half of whom I had never heard of. Interestingly, he explains that Catholic scientist St George Jackson Mivart (who was excommunicated in 1900) was granted a doctorate in philosophy by Pope Pius IX after writing a book entitled *Genesis of Species*, which tried to demonstrate, among other things, that «nothing in Evolution generally was necessarily antagonistic to Christianity.»<br />Chapter 7, On Creation, is a summary of Aquinas's five «ways» to show the necessary existence of an omnipotent creator, reformulated for modern readers. I was particularly surprised to learn that according to Aquinas, reason cannot tell us that the world has begun «in time», i.e. is not eternal. But having read his arguments in the Summa Theologica (ST, I, q. 46, a. 2), I did not find them potent enough to overcome the problem of the actualized infinite implied by an eternally existing universe.<br />The last chapter briefly summarizes the history of paleoanthropology, arbitrarily adopting homo sapiens as the race for Adam; suggesting that the rib episode may be nothing more than a poetic way of saying that «man and woman have one nature and are therefore suitable mates»; and examining the problems of monogenism vs. polygenism and of animal suffering in an evolving creation.<br />Though very basic and almost simplistic at times, *Evolution and Creation: a Catholic Understanding* is a clear and level-headed introduction to the subject for people who do not have time to read much and may not have the intellectual equipment or the patience to absorb more advanced exegetical, scientific or philosophical works. Moreover it defends what I believe to be the true position on the subject and delivers a correct verdict on both «creationism» («their theology is misguided and their creation science a disaster») and materialistic evolutionism (which it calls a «destructive ideology.»)	2004-07-10

Probably every Catholic ecclesiastic and theologian must have felt like an employee in some venerable public company that had just lost its legal monopoly, and was suddenly forced to adapt to the rigorous demands of the free market, by confronting the competition on its own terms and responding to consumer demand.<br />Michael Schmaus's six-volume *Dogma* was born of that revolution. Published in 1968, it cites as its most revered authorities such names as Yves Congar, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Henri de Lubac, Hans Kung and above all Karl Rahner, all of them intellectual pillars of the Conciliar Church.<br />Schmaus's main contention seems to be that the message of the Church can be divided into two parts : a core of unchangeable truth, and a whole gamut of historically determined, changeable (one might almost say disposable) expressions of that core. Because man's mental categories are constantly being reshaped, no single expression of the faith can be considered as valid for all ages, not even Jesus's own words, for Jesus, after all, «is the child of his people, speaks their language, lives as they live and prays their prayers... His thoughts move in a form which is different from the western way of thinking, since the latter is determined by the classical Greek forms of thought.» (p46)<br />Schmaus therefore has decided to offer modern man a translation of Catholic dogma compatible with his thought patterns ; a translation which, he assures us, will simply be a new formulation of pre-existing truths, since «nothing of the old faith shall be eliminated, nor anything added; it shall be presented unabridged and unfalsified» (p xii.)<br />The major aspect of this translation, the one which determines the whole structure of the work, is the abandonment of what Schmaus calls «the theology of concept or of essence», characterized by «ontological thinking », in favour of an «existential» theology, which «interprets truth primarily not in its being but in its relationship to man» (p xiv.) In other words, rather than asking what things are, Schmaus tries to answer the question : «What's in it for me?»<br />When applied to the theme of the present volume, this approach leads to a redefinition of Revelation as a «salvific dialogue between God and humanity» (p5), which must be understood not so much through a rigorous analysis of its content as through a contextualized history of its development. In the interest of existential pertinence, dogma is therefore reduced to its soteriologically relevant components, while salvation itself is surreptitiously naturalized («In the world of today, salvation is seen above all in welfare, in freedom, in education, and in peace», p139.)<br />For some reason, I did not hate the book, though because of its lack of clarity and somewhat rambling structure, my eyes occasionally tended to glaze over, and I would be at a loss to summarize its overall argument (if any) or to single out any forceful point the author may have made (and not contradicted in fact or in equally forceful statements.) The general effect of the book is of a big blur that never goes anywhere specific but does appear to be moving in some direction : reading it will not make your mind stronger or more accurate, only more flexible and therefore more apt to bend over backwards for ecumenical purposes.<br />Having read only one volume of this series, and being relatively new to the subject, I cannot decide whether Schmaus's approach to dogmatics (which, he tells us, is in the tradition of Augustine, Bonaventure and Newman) is a valid one, or whether it is just another learned contribution to the work of post-conciliar destruction. At best, I suspect it can only serve as a complement to the more classical «ontological» approach, as exemplifiedby such works as the highly regarded twelve-volume Pohle-Preuss series. I do intend to read the other five volumes of the collection to make up my mind, as part of my attempt to give the Conciliar Church a second chance, though I will also seek some critical ammunition in such books as Robert C. McCarthy's *A Critical Examination of the Theology of Karl Rahner* and Cardinal Siri's *Gethsemane* (in addition to Romano Amerio's brilliant *Iota Unum*, which I have already reviewed for this site.)	2004-03-03

He thereby established the immutability of the Truth, of the Moral Law and of the Revelation from Old Testament times to the Last Judgment.<br />But immutability does not sit well with modern man, whose fondness for discarding iotas has affected many within the Catholic Church, to the point that one may wonder whether it is undergoing a crisis comparable to the Lutheran secession, the schism of the French clergy during the French Revolution or the modernist heresy at the turn of the 19th century.<br />Having defined a «crisis» as a rejection of the very principles of the Church *from within*, as opposed to the world at large, Romano Amerio (1905-1997) searches ecclesiastical history for clear-cut instances, establishing standards with which to judge the present situation. He then surveys the preparation for Vatican II, of which he speaks with some measure of authority, since he was the peritus for the bishop of Lugano and «got to know all the documents»; the course of the council itself; and finally the immediate post-conciliar period under the pontificate of Paul VI, a pope whose renunciation of authority made him rather unfit for the post, leading to a proliferation of abuses sheepishly condemned by ineffective words.<br />The book then adopts a more thematic approach, dealing with such issues as the crisis of the priesthood, liturgical absurdities or increasingly outspoken, heretical and obdurate dissent within the Church. It is easy to picture the author painstakingly collecting thousands of articles from the Osservatore Romano and the religious press, building up his case over two decades of meticulous research. But what he offers us is no mere enumeration, no disjointed «horror file», but a methodical diagnosis of the evils he describes, down to their metaphysical and theological roots.<br />Amerio has a gift for identifying «-isms», or ideologies that are displacing traditional pillars of Catholic thought. «Mobilism» is the self-contradictory, romantic «mentality that values becoming more than being, motion more than rest, action more than the goal», holding that «to be forever aspiring is better than attaining». Feminism he aptly shows to be a «masculinism». «Discussionism» is the egalitarian cult of dialogue which has replaced proselytism; «juvenilism», the adoration of youth that surfaces in some naive pontifical statements; and pyrrhonism, the root-and-branch skepticism that is engulfing the Church built on a rock.<br />A master logician, Amerio dissects what he calls (after Giordano Bruno) the «circiterisms» of the reformists- a generic name for the fuzzy, «more-or-less» thinking that characterizes much of post-conciliar rhetoric. He is dismayed by «that dulling of logical thought, which stems from losing a sense of the difference between the natures of things, and which leads to a confusing of one thing with another», as evinced by the non-missionary vocation of modern missions; the «hybridization of faith and hope» in theological discourse; or the priests and married men who perceive their very identity as a constraint on their liberty. Particularly noteworthy is Amerio's discussion of Heaven and Hell as the eternal vindication of the distinction between right and wrong.<br />*Iota Unum* is more than 700 pages of sheer intellectual brilliance. Not only is Romano Amerio a highly cultured man, and a specialist of such writers as Antonio Rosmini, Campanella (on whom he wrote his PhD thesis) or Manzoni (whose *Observations on Catholic Morality* he published a critical edition of), but he is also a luminously clear, deep and systematic thinker, a distinction which years of teaching philosophy, greek and latin can only partly explain. There is probably no university left in the world where you can learn to think like that.<br />Considering this work to be definitely one of the best I have reviewed for this site, I have already bought a copy of the author's *Stat Veritas*, a much slimmer volume of commentaries on the apostolic letter «Tertio Millennio Adveniente», fortunately translated in French; but as for the rest of his bibliography, which I would have gladly devoured, Amerio has simply made me add Italian to the list of languages I wish I could read.	2003-09-17

But this assumes that to be rational is to have «no needs, desires, goals or aims», which is itself false and therefore irrational. (Then again, can't you view your own ends and needs themselves from a cosmic perspective ?)<br />And finally, the classical model advocates an exaggerated cautiousness which often leaves the thinker in limbo: «Rationalists are committed to seeking knowledge, and when they cannot meet high standards of evidence, they value suspending belief rather than accepting ill-founded beliefs.» But since life has to be lived, this is also unworkable.<br />The classical ideal, therefore, must be abandoned, which Nathanson promptly does, opting for an instrumentalist, pragmatic conception of rationality in which what matters is getting results. If it works for you, it is rational, even if it involves self-deception or other forms of untruth which the classical ideal rejects on principle: your reason must be the slave of your passions andhelp you maximize the satisfaction of your desires.<br />But as the resulting model of rationality turns out to be a little messy and potentially self-destructive, Nathanson scavenges a few provisos from colleagues and abandons the maximization of desires in favour of acting in one's best interests. He argues that our ideals should not be inconsistent, immoral, bizarre, harmful or based on false beliefs and ends up with a definition or «rationality within reason» as «acting for the best» or making «the best use of our cognitive powers in striving for things we take to be good»- a formula subjectivists should find much to their liking, all the more so as he explains that «a pure egoist, from this perspective, coul act for the best from the rational perspective and yet act in a way that is grossly immoral.»<br />Though written in a non-technical style by a person who seems to be honestly trying to get somewhere, *The Ideal of Rationality* shares many of the flaws of modern philosophy books: it starts philosophizing in midair, prefers philosophical patchworks to system-building and ends up in a middle-of-the-road position that looks like a horse designed by a committee.<br />Though Nathanson argues that to be rational is to act efficiently in one's own best interests, he fails to acknowledge that determining where one's interests lie first requires us to answer certain fundamental metaphysical questions, such as: Do I have a soul ? Do I have eternal interests ? And do my actions here on Earth influence those eternal interests ? For if I do, these interests will outweigh my temporal ones in any utilitarian calculus I can think of.<br />Nathanson implicitly answers all these questions negatively, assuming a fashionably materialistic point of view. This is why he cannot but conclude that rationality does not require us to think of others in our deliberations. But since «criticism of factual beliefs... is one way in which ideals can be rationally assessed», hisideal of rationality stands or falls with the «factual beliefs» the truthfulness of which it takes for granted.<br />The first questions we should answer according to the author's own conception of rationality are therefore the very questions his book leaves unanswered.	2003-08-25

Hallett of the National Catholic Register «a definitive history of the Lefebvre case down through 1976», *Apologia Pro Marcel Lefebvre* is the first of a three-volume series covering the Archbishop's life from 1970 to 1982.<br />Having devoted a mere ten pages to Marcel Lefebvre's exemplary life from his birth in Tourcoing, France in 1905 to his would be retirement from public life in 1968, Michael Davies moves on to what is the real focus of the book: the so-called «Econe affair» and the ensuing conflict between Mgr Lefebvre and the Vatican.<br />In 1970, Mgr Lefebvre founded the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX) and its seminary at Econe, Switzerland, with full canonical approval (contrary to later claims that it was a «wildcat seminary.») In the post conciliar climate, however, this seminary was perceived by the liberals as a threat to their on-going dogmatic and liturgical revolution, because the Archbishop was forming priests along pre-Vatican II lines, trained to say the Tridentine Mass and fully cognizant of the tradition.<br />A Visitation was ordered by the Commission of Cardinals in 1974, hoping to find something wrong with the seminary. The report however was full of praise for the work being done at Econe. Only the leaking of a document called the «Declaration» provided any grounds for action against the SSPX: originally written for the seminarians and not intended in any way as a rebellious manifesto, it expressed Marcel Lefebvre's rejection of «the Rome of Neo-Modernist and Neo-Protestant tendencies», as evinced in the Visitors' heretical statements in favour of a married clergy and against the immutability of Truth and the Resurrection of Christ.<br />Mgr Lefebvre was summoned to an «interview» with the Commission of Cardinals, which later turned out to have been an informal trial, the only one he ever got. On the basis of the interview, the SSPX was suppressed, only two months before the final examinations at Econe, and theArchbishop was left without any possibility of an appeal because of some canonical subtlety involving the Pope's fiat.<br />Considering the suppression of his society to have been perhaps uncanonical and obviously unjust, Mgr Lefebvre demanded to be tried by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (the modern Inquisition), arguing that his society and seminary should not be penalized for whatever personal opinion he might have expressed. This was denied to him. Confronted to the Vatican's closed and rather devious attitude, he simply chose to await a genuine trial and went on with the work of the SSPX.<br />*Apologia Pro Marcel Lefebvre* is a chronologically arranged documentary history of the whole «Econe Affair», which truly enables the reader to understand the dramatic series of events leading to the Archbishop's willful disobedience to Pope Paul VI. Not only has Michael Davies collected an impressive array of letters and articles, but he also offers brilliant contextualisations and analyses of the various documents presented, demonstrating a real gift for philosophical detection.<br />The book also includes a twenty-page diary of the author's 1975 stay at the Econe seminary and a first hand account of the 1976 mass in Lille, which he personally attended. The 90 pages of appendices include a chronology of the events; parallels between Mgr Lefebvre, St Athanasius in the fourth century and Robert Grosseteste in the thirteenth; a history of pontifical abuses showing that Popes, although infallible when speaking ex cathedra on matters of faith and morals, are nonetheless not inerrant or necessarily just in their decisions; and, among other things, an in-depth article by Reverend Dr. Boyd A. Cathey on the «Legal Background to the Erection and the Alleged Suppression» of the SSPX.<br />Like all of the works by Michael Davies I have read so far, *Apologia Pro Marcel Lefebvre* is a book that really helped me clarify my thinking on the topics covered. Anythingby Michael Davies is worth purchasing and studying, and I certainly look forward to reading the next two volumes, also available from Angelus Press. As for those looking for a full biography, watch out for a translation of the recently published «Marcel Lefebvre: Une Vie» by Mgr Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, one of the founders of the SSPX.	2003-08-24

As the Council opened, though, the so-called «Rhine group», liberal bishops from Germany, launched a «blitzkrieg» which enabled them to hijack the Council and impose their agenda.<br />Having taken control of conciliar procedure and packed the various commissions, they started planting what Archhbishop Lefebvre called «time bombs» in the various documents: carefully worded ambiguities which would enable them to explode infallible dogmas and well-established customs in the name of a Council which describes itself as merely «pastoral» and denies having issued any infallible teaching.<br />Michael Davies documents how the press and Protestant «observers» further influenced the Council in the direction of liberalism and protestantism; how Pope Paul VI's devotion to Jacques Maritain's «integral humanism» is echoed by the *Constitution on the Church in the Modern World* and underlies the Council's refusal to condemn the most vicious ideology ever devised by man, Communism; how, contrary to liberal claims, the Church is being infiltrated by Masons in full sympathy with the so-called «spirit of the Council»; and how Vatican II can be held responsible for the debacle of the Catholic Church in the last third of the twentieth century.<br />*Pope John's Council*, like all of Michael Davies's books, is a dense, well-organized, objective, no-nonsense treatment of its subject and it is probably one of the best introductions available to what really went on at the Council. It should be read in connection with the author's *The Second Vatican Council and Religious Liberty*, which deals specifically with *Dignitatis Humanae* and its contradiction of previously established Church teaching. <br />Among the relevant readings the author recommends are Mgr George Kelly's *The Battle for the American Church*; Fr. R. M. Wiltgen's *The Rhine Flows into the Tiber*; Dr. Von Hildebrand's *Trojan Horse in the City of God*; Jules Meinvielle's *De Lamennais a Maritain*; and Dom Paul Nau's *The Ordinary Magisterium of the Church Theologically Considered*.	2003-08-24

Are you sure?	*Virtuous Passions* has an interesting theme: the ethics of the passions, or the idea that one has to learn ?how to be moved (angered, shamed, delighted, drawn) by the right persons and things, to the right extent, for the right reasons, in the right way, at the right time.? Most people do not think of passions as things that can be right or wrong, but as mere givens about which morality has nothing to say. This is perhaps why Stoicism and eastern spiritualities have so much appeal: because they actually have something to say about the passions and what to do about them.<br />The author being a Jesuit and writing as such (as the S. J. after his name on the cover indicates), I expected this topic to be treated from a Catholic point of view. But despite the chapters on Aquinas's Treaty on the Passions (or Harak's doubtful paraphrase of it) and Ignatius's Exercises, it is not. To put things bluntly, Harak is a heretic, a wolf in sheep's clothing.<br />At first, I was merely annoyed by the inescapable ?inclusive talk?, which leads to such weird writing as ?We cannot really comprehend God, so God reveals God's self to us?, simply because the author will not refer to God as a ?He? and to God's self as ?His self.? This made me wonder what Harak's prayers must sound like. ?In the name of the Parent, and the Child, and the Holy Ghost? ? Surely some feminist must have thought of that one...<br />Then, there is the intellectual sloppiness, this fuzziness about concepts which contrasts blatantly with the scholastic mode of thought. Harak is a man who likes to blur boundaries, to ?melt things? like Phoebe's long lost brother, so that concepts acquire a Dali-like quality in the book. ?Passions? for instance are more or less defined as ?our experience of being moved by the other? (?the other? referring alternatively to people, God and peanuts), so that when your spouse is driving, this must count as a passion...<br />Conceptual distinctions are anathema to the author. For instance, he resolves the mind-body dichotomy by resorting to Karl Pribram's model of memory as spread out throughout the body (not just the brain)- the so-called ?holographic paradigm? which is so popular among New Agers. He explains that ?once we have dichotomized mental and physical, we have no way of explaining how the mental would ever act on the physical and vice versa.? In other words, he confuses a conceptual distinction with an ontological one, and assumes that dualism is necessarily bankrupt, when Catholicism is dualist.<br />Based on this ?mind-body meld?, Harak seems to be saying that violence for instance is memorized in our very cells, nervous and non-nervous, so that if you practice martial arts or play console games, you write violence into your biological structure.<br />The man / beast distinction is also one he disapproves of : ?Humans used to think of themselves as the only subjects... But evolutionary science has changed that, giving us a sense of commonality.? Too bad the beasts cannot read Darwin: the sense of commonality would be mutual, and mosquitoes might stop biting us.<br />Where Harak diverges most from Church teaching is in his ethics of absolute non-violence, which dissents from the clear just war tradition of the Catholic Church, as stated in its latest official Catechism. ?The self violates itself in preparing weapons that violate another?, he writes. I just wonder how he expects the police to protect law-abiding citizens. By creating human chains around houses and waiting for criminals to beat them down? But then again, there probably will not be any police or government in the utopia Harak dreams about, as he sympathizes with the feminist goal of destabilizing ?the existing social order and its hierarchies of power- religious (!!!), social and economic.?<br />The Church, by the way, is always referred to as the ?church?, Harak's covert way of rejecting the Catholic structure as it stands today in favour of some mystical body of his own conception, including Martin Luther King, Mahomet and Gandhi as its luminaries.<br />For the Catholic Church as we know it is all wrong, according to Harak's premises, though he lets the reader draw his own conclusions. Embracing radical feminist critiques, he explains that ?the understanding of power as hierarchical, competitive and exclusivistic [is] the theoretical undergirding for the injustice of violence which so plagues our world.? Hierarchical bodies intrinsically generate violence, in other words, so much so that ?those with a passion for non-violence will be marginalized, and even persecuted? by them. Now since the Church is the arch-example of a hierachical structure, the reader is free to consider the implications.<br />Traditional Catholics might also be put off by Harak's extreme ecumenism. In an interview, he declared that ?there are thousands of ways of coming to God? and in the present book, he likes to quote non-Christian sources, such as the Qu'ran, George Fox or, for that matter, the popular musical Les Miserables or the Pointer Sisters, who have very relevant things to say about being moved by the other and not being able to conceal the fact.<br />*Virtuous Passions* is a very disingenuous book, though I would not have hated it half as much if it had been written by a non-Catholic (a Quaker for instance) or better, by a declared enemy of the Church. As such, however, it has got me worried enough to add three books to my reading list: Donna Steichen's *Ungodly Rage : The Hidden Face of Catholic Feminism*; Malachi Martin's *The Jesuits* and Joseph Beccker's two-volume *The Re-formed Jesuits*.	2003-08-08

The historical part, for instance, which represents about three fifths of the book, could have been written by a really gifted philosophy student abstracting the relevant portions from Frederick Copleston's *History of Philosophy*.<br />One fact I particularly appreciated though is that Paul Haffner is a «disciple» of Stanley Jaki, a Benedictine monk with a PhD in physics and one in theology whom I consider to be one of the greatest living minds, and one of the few authors I know who I believe have got virtually everything right (which, I have come to realize, is much more important than simply being brilliant.) The author of *Creation and Scientific Creativity : A Study in the Thought of S. L. Jaki*, Haffner quotes his mentor copiously, and his general viewpoint can best be described as «Jakian.»<br />A related book on my reading list is Edward Grant's *God and Reason in the Middle Ages* (2001).	2003-08-07

As such, its primary purpose it to demonstrate the student's mastery of a particular field of study to a panel of professors. It therefore has more in common with, say, a demonstration of horsemanship than with a book which genuinely attempts to enlighten the minds of its readers.<br />Its purported audience being a small group of people who are supposed to have more general knowledge and even perhaps more specialized knowledge of the subject than the author herself, it cannot be considered a good introduction to Aquinas's theory of the intellectual virtues. Itis written in technical language, contains numerous untranslated passages in latin, French and German, and would probably be most profitable to someone who has already read the relevant portions of the Summa and has a good grasp of Thomism in general, and especially of thomistic psychology.<br />A related book on my reading list is Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski's *Virtues of the Mind : An Inquiry into the Nature of Virtue and the Ethical Foundations of Knowledge*.	2003-08-07

I therefore had only a very faint idea of its contents, believing it to be a wholesale attack on «values-free education» combined with an attempt to understand the causes of the general malaise in the educational system, of which I am a firsthand observer.<br />But James Demers' book is much more focused than that. It can best be described as a semi-autobiographical series of vignettes charting the development of Canadian education and mores from the fifties to the nineties, interspersed with more structured chapters relying mostly on quotations to document the deeper origins of the decay.<br />As a Catholic, Demers concentrates on religious causes: the abandonment of the Baltimore Catechism, with its clear-cut answers, in favour of bland, relativistic New Age catechisms, in which sometimes as little as 3% of Catholic dogma was covered; the dumbing down of the traditional Mass and its replacement with an impoverished, feel-good, clap-your-hands mockery of the liturgy; and above all, the imposition on children in the «latency period» of highly explicit sexual education stressing mechanics and shedding morality.<br />According to Demers, all these developments can be traced to the hijacking of the Catholic Church by a small network of «dissenting clergy and renegade theologians» who have betrayed both the faithful and the upper echelons of the Church hierarchy in order to swamp the world with their own brand of modernism, rationalism and liberalism, based on specious interpretations of Vatican II documents.<br />Demers blames this fifth column, and such collaborators as meddling sociologists, «the feminist movement, Planned Parenthood, gay-lesbian equal rights activists, abortion advocates [and] jackbooted ex-nuns» for our modern despair and its myriad manifestations, from drug-addictions to sexual promiscuity, suicide, pornography and pedophilia.<br />*Children of Winter* is very different from the more dispassionate scholastic works I am used to reading. It is not the kind of book you reward with a «cogently argued and well researched» accolade: a compulsive underliner myself, I left the volume unmarked. The best way to get an idea of its tone is from the presentation of the author as «a broadcaster, teacher, and playwright with 25 years experience in education and the arts.» With his flair for drama, characterization, telling anecdotes, pop-culture references and high-impact images, Demers writes in a style much more reminiscent of a Stephen King than of a Catholic scholar like, say, Michael Davies.<br />The result is as good as modern journalism gets, which in my opinion deserves three stars, or the equivalent of two (frozen) thumbs up...	2002-07-05

In 1879, a year after his inauguration, he issued an encyclical- a circular letter in Latin addressed to all high Church officials- in which he urged his «Venerable Brethen, in all earnestness, to restore the golden wisdom of St. Thomas, and to spread it far and wide for the defence and beauty of the Catholic faith, for the good of society and for the advantage of all the sciences» (*Aeterni Patris*.) Out of this encyclical, and other efforts of the Pope such as the preparation of a new edition of the works of St. Thomas in the 1880s or the foundation in 1891 of the Institute of Philosophy of Louvain, came the great neoscholastic revival of the late 19th century, one of whose fruits was the publication of a book which finally convinced me of the existence of God.<br />*Aeterni Patris* is only one of the documents reproduced in this thick, 580-page volume, which offers a selection of Leo XIII's epoch-making encyclicals, as well as a few apostolic letters and personal letters, arranged chronologically.<br />According to the *Catholic Enclyclopedia*, the function of encyclicals is to «condemn some prevalent form of error, point out dangers which threaten faith or morals, exhort the faithful to constancy, or prescribe remedies for evils foreseen or already existent». Potential readers of this book should therefore be warned that encyclicals are not merely presentations of Church doctrine, but that they are also composed to a large extent of orders, exhortations, advice, prayers, congratulations, condemnations and other non-argumentative passages.<br />Among the most important encyclicals collected here are those dealing with the social doctrine of the Church, from the repeated, unequivocal condemnations of socialism, communism and anarchism, to a strong criticism of the separation of Church and state or a defense of the sanctity of Christian marriage against the encroachments of the state. Conservatives and classical liberals might wish to have the following words engraved in gold letters on their mantelpiece: «The first and most fundamental principle if one would undertake to alleviate the condition of the masses, must be the inviolability of private property» (*Rerum Novarum*, 1891.)<br />Of great relevance to modern discussions of «civil rights» is the Apostolic Constitution *Officiorum ac Munerum*, which briefly summarizes the history of Church control of the press and contains the text of the «General decrees concerning the prohibition and censorship of books», spelling out the general rules to be observed by Church officials and the faithful generally concerning various sorts of potentially dangerous publications. As for the principle behind these rules, it is best summarized by a short sentence in the Pope's 1908 *Review of his Pontificate* : «the rights of truth [...] are superior to the demands of liberty», an unpopular position in our relativistic age, which often explicitly rejects certainty for fear of its political consequences.<br />Other historical landmarks include an apostolic letter on the Anglican Orders (1896), which declared absolutely and for all eternity «that Ordinations carried out according to the Anglican rite have been and are absolutely null and utterly void»; and the Apostolic Letter Vigilantiae, which established the Biblical Commission, based on the principle that «God has not delivered the Scriptures to the private judgment of the learned, but has confided the interpretation of them to the teaching of the Church.»<br />*A Light in the Heavens* is a collection of documents that deserve to be read by all Catholics. Those documents, however, are widely available on the net, and apart from its rather cursory four-page preface and the fact that it is bound, the present book offers no single advantage over a homemade printout. There is no index, no introduction to the various documents (one of which is not even dated) and no elucidation of obscure references and technical terms (such as subreption and obreption.) It is also difficult to know just how complete the documents are. For instance, according to the *Catholic Encyclopedia*, one of the purposes of the encyclical *Au Milieu des Sollicitudes* was «to guard against the dangers of the new style of apologetics founded on Kantism and now known as Modernism .» However, the present text merely deals with relations between Church and state in France.<br />Readers interested in more systematic (and indexed) treatments of the social doctrine of the Church based on the teachings of Leo XIII might be directed to Rev. E. Cahill's *The Framework of a Christian State* and Rev. Denis Fahey's several volumes on the Mystical Body of Christ, both of which contain copious extracts from the encyclicals featured in the present volume.made printout.

US	53093154	R1MA8UFL0EOERC	0961297026	244651270	Beastmarks	Books	5	15	15	N	N	If I were you...	Most of A. A. Attanasio's writings belong to vast ensembles, like his Radix Tetrad, his Irth trilogy or his Arthurian (or rather Arthorian) tetralogy. Even a shorter work like *The Moon's Wife* is filled with echoes of earlier novels, like the pierced stone from *Hunting the Ghost Dancer*, the fascination with the Earth's magnetic field or the charged creatures that inhabit the ionosphere.<br />It is therefore an uncommon experience for the Attanasio devotee to dip into these seven much briefer pieces, the shortest of which is no more than two and a half pages long, making up a total of 120 pages.<br />All the stories are described by the author as «stories of trespass» dealing with «a consciousness that is in a place where it doesn't belong.» As in the rest of his fiction, where he has striven to explore all the varieties of consciousness, from subhuman to human to superhuman and all that's in between, Attanasio seems to be driven by an urge to experience the world from the vintage point of other subjectivities, the more alien the more attractive. His main preoccupation as a writer is to understand what it is like for someone else - or something else - to be present to the world, from the «bear dreaming of a salmon-wild river» in «Nuclear Tan» to the «7th-dimensional consciousness» snatched out of its «antibaryon universe» by a frenzied hypertube and brought into contact with Earth dolphins in «Over the Rainbow».<br />This urge to lift himself out of his mental patterns he seems to have inherited from Keats, whom he himself quotes in «The Answerer of Dreams» : «Through his imagination [Keats] felt he could `enter into the identities of other beings' and find the `essential beauty' in the *anima mundi*, the soul of all things.» What matters to Attanasio is not to reach an abstract, conceptual cognition of others, but empathically to feel their inner being. «It's not understanding you must seek,» says one of his characters, «but receptivity [...]flexible, open awareness.»<br />Often, the author follows characters who are themselves forced to experience the world through the medium of a foreign form of awareness. In «The Last Dragon Master», set in China in the Period of the Warring States, Yu Ching undergoes a kind of illumination even taoist monks do not want to be poisoned with. In «Sherlock Holmes and Basho», Conan Doyle's thinking machine is confronted to the intuitive outlook of the eremitic Japanese aesthete, some of whose haiku you may have heard in Takahata's *My Neighbour the Yamadas*. While in «Monkey Puzzle», explicitly fictional psychic beings are trapped into human bodies and minds by some curious gravity they cannot fathom.<br />But my favorite two pieces are the longest and last of this collection. «Matter Mutter Mother» is a futuristic tale reminiscent of the Radix universe, with its lynks, psybots and other technological wonders. Once more, it deals with an alienated consciousness: a woman trapped in a man's body; a «shortsighted man living in a mechanical and dangerous life» who has made the mistake of experiencing enlightenment and is lost. Written backwards, in a series of vignettes moving from effect to cause, the story might seem to have a very contrived and deliberately confusing structure, like most of the modernist fiction that seeks to do away with linearity. But the device actually makes for very moving reading and is not so counter-intuitive. For after all, do we not often experience sequences of events this way, the past making the present clear with a delay ?<br />As for «The Answerer of Dreams», it is a transhumanistic love story filled with more staples of Attanasio's futuristic visions- olfacts, pleroma music and yet more psybots. It illustrates how, despite the revolution technology is wreaking in men's bodies and minds, their souls retain the same basic longings. «The world endlessly reinvents itself, yet the language of love remains trite.» Here the authorintersperses the narrative with his own reflections in the midst of the creative process, a literary device that might a priori appear to be an annoyance but which, rather than detracting from the enjoyment of the fictional world, actually enhances it.<br />Many readers might be turned off by the versatility of Attanasio's imagination, his penchant for the weird, the other-wordly, the cryptic, the insane and the impalpable. As for me, *Beastmarks* only whetted my appetite for more of his short stories - and I know there are at least thirteen others out there waiting to be collected, another number that does not divide evenly into a circle.	2002-04-10
US	53093154	REMXNEX7CZE12	0691047200	740380042	Jefferson's Literary Commonplace Book: (Princeton Legacy Library)	Books	4	18	19	N	N	A superb edition of an interesting document	Published as part of the *Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Second Series*, *Jefferson's Literary Commonplace Book* is the definitive edition of a collection of about four hundred quotations Jefferson gathered from his more literary readings during his student years. It represents, according to the editor, «one of the few surviving documents from Jefferson's formative years» and reveals a transitional, private facet of a man most of us know through his mature, public years.<br />«Commonplacing » seems to have been one of the practices of the readers of Jefferson's time: it consisted in copying the most eloquent or profound passages one encountered in one's readings into a notebook one would presumably read over and over again. If I remember correctly, John Locke also commonplaced, and Jefferson himself left us more specialized notebooks, such as the legal ones he produced in the mid 1760s.<br />Most of the quotes in the present volume are from works of «imaginative literature»- mostly poems Jefferson enjoyed in his youth, from Homer to another favorite of his, «Ossian», whom he believed to be a genuine third-century Celtic bard but who was in fact a fabrication of his eighteenth-century «translator», James McPherson. Most of the quotes are in English, but a substantial number of them are in foreign languages Jefferson was fluent in: ancient Greek, latin and French, all of them translated in the footnotes. Two criteria seem to have presided to their inclusion: their felicity of expression and very often the little gems of wisdom they contain - on the law of identity: «If white, & black, blend, soften & Unite/ A thousand Ways ; is there no black or White ?» ; on the virtue of productivity: «without employ/ the soul is on a rack ; the rack of rest» ; or on objective reasoning: «He who has judged aught, with the other side unheard, may have judged righteously, but was himself unrighteous.»<br />Perhaps more interesting to the historian of ideas, this literarycommonplace book also contains thirty pages of extracts from Bolingbroke's essays and letters, which almost singlehandedly shaped Jefferson's religious outlook and help explain the «self-evident» standards Jefferson applied in his heretical selective rewriting of the Gospels. Bolinbgroke's crucial influence on Jefferson's philosophical outlook is stressed by the editor in the highly helpful thirty-two-page «Register of Authors» which follows the excerpts : «the major tenets of Bolingbroke's philosophical program were ultimately adopted by Jefferson as his own: a thoroughgoing materalism; a rejection of metaphysics and all speculation that ventures beyond the reach of human apprehension; an uncompromising commitment to reason as the final arbiter of knowledge and validity; a disposition to regard churchmen and theologians as the corrupters of Christianity; a distate for the doctrines of Plato and his influence on Christian teachings; and a strong skepticism regarding the historicity of biblical accounts. » (p156)<br />In addition to being a window on the young Jefferson's soul (or lack thereof), this volume is remarkable for the thorough and careful work of its editor (except for a grammatical error in a French quotation from Racine, in §395) and will be beautifully complemented by *Jefferson's Extracts from the Gospels*, published in the same series.	2002-04-08
US	53093154	R2K2VQ6PL26PL2	0931888182	872442549	The Founding of Christendom (A History of Christendom, Vol. 1)	Books	5	73	78	N	N	An outstanding Catholic alternative to Will Durant	«History is a cosmic battleground between Heaven and Hell.» - Warren H. Carroll<br />The first of a projected six-part *History of Christendom*, the next three volumes of which have already been published, *The Birth Of Christendom* is history with a difference : as its author, Warren H. Carroll, PhD, confesses at the very outset, it «is written by a Catholic, from a Catholic perspective, with the conviction that Jesus Christ founded a church and that the visible church He founded is the Roman Catholic Church which, through its succession of Popes in particular, has remained, and always will be his Church.»<br />But a history of Christendom- of which this is, according to the author, the only example ever published in the twentieth century- is not just a history of the Church: it is the history of the «Christian public order», which «includes as a major element the lay or temporal order insofar as it is penetrated and influenced by Christianity. The greater the degree of this penetration or influence, the more significant is the temporal history so affected, for the historian of Christendom.»<br />*The Birth of Christendom* therefore begins much earlier than with the birth of the Church, with an account of the events, Divine and human, that set the stage for «The Incarnation of the Lord» (to borrow the title of Chapter 14), the most momentous of which being Creation and Original Sin.<br />The first thirteen chapters of the book are predominantly a history of Israel, for the Jews were after all God's Chosen People, the one with whom He made His first Covenant, and to whose prophets He provided some foreknowledge of the coming of His Son.<br />But Carroll does not neglect the Providential role played by two Pagan civilizations, the Greek and the Roman, and more especially by two men, Alexander and Octavian : the former's Hellenization of the East «provided a cultural unity» and a common language that paved the way for evangelization, while the latter's establishment of the Pax Romana came at the appointed time : «The central event of history was drawing very close. The Prince of Peace needed to begin His work in a time of peace.» (p279)<br />Carroll's interest, therefore, extends also to «the world which revelation had not yet reached». The Gentiles and Pagans he often characterizes as inspired by the devil (like the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, «those masters of satanic cruelty») and more occasionally as glorious, though Pagan virtue can only go so far, and « cosmic despair ... lies at the end of every pagan road, even the most brilliant». India definitely belongs to the former category : its «strange doctrines» and «convoluted mysticism» evince «a satanic spiritual climate». However brilliant the Buddha and the Mahavira may have been, and however benevolent their moral example, India's metaphysics destroys the very possibility of rationality : «in that world, there is no choosing, no either-or, no law of non-contradiction, everything and anything can be true, nothing is false.»<br />Ancient Greece on the other hand is to be praised : «Second only to the Jews, the Greeks are the most extraordinary people in history... Only our people, which has lost so much else, has lost or is losing its respect for the Greek mind and achievements.» Part of their brilliance the Greeks owed to «the incomparable Aristotle», in whose philosophy «the mind could know itself, know that it knew external, objective reality, and know *how* it knew that reality- an achievement of enormous magnitude for one man so early in the history of thought.»<br />But the focal point of the volume is of course Christ. There is no entry for «Jesus» in the index. However, the reader will find two pages of references on JESUS CHRIST, OUR LORD AND SAVIOR, the only capitalized entry. In the three chapters and more than one hundred pages that are devoted to Him, Carroll throws away all the skepticism of «our present age of secularismand apostasy» to present a fully orthodox image of Christ as the Incarnation of God, born of a consecrated virgin, miracle-maker and the Redeemer of mankind. Though fully knoweldgeable about modern controversies, Carroll makes a very strong case for a return to admirable scholars of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, showing how many sound and unrefuted arguments have simply been forgotten «in our change-obsessed age.»<br />From then on, the book becomes a chronicle of Christianity's spread through the Roman Empire, with a history of the Popes and martyrs up to the reign of Constantine, whom Carroll rescues from much inimical scholarship and presents as a genuine convert to Catholic Christianity and the Founder of Christendom proper.<br />*The Founding of Christendom* is an extremely well-researched and well-argued work, at once scholarly and exciting, and never afraid to swim against the tide. Particularly praiseworthy is its wonderful, twenty-two page annotated bibliography, a true gateway to the best scholarship on the period (the origins to 324 A.D.), stating the religious orientation of most volumes and Carroll's estimate of their scholarly worth.	2001-12-23

The rather ugly Bakshi movie was the first one I went to see without my parents, and the novel was virtually the first one I ever read that was not a children's book, except for Jules Verne's *Mysterious Island*. Just like many Tolkien fans, I became a lifelong devotee of the fantasy genre, and explored the more promising of the other Middle-Earths, from Lankhmar to the Dark Shore, Lyonesse, Majipoor, Amber, Earthsea and the world of the Hyborean Age.<br />But of all the fantasy series I ever read, the only that ever compared to Tolkien's masterpiece in my opinion was Gene Wolfe's *New Urth* tetralogy. The others were fun, imaginative, full of action and adventure, but they either failed to maintain throughout the literary and spiritual power I had found in *The Lord of the Rings* or to equal the richness of its world-building.<br />Interestingly enough, however different Tolkien's and Wolfe's epics might be, they share two profound similarities. First, both were written by Catholics and infused with their author's faith. With Tolkien, all the trappings of religion are evacuated from the world itself while the story is saturated with religious symbolism. With Wolfe, on the contrary, Christianity is still very present but transformed, as if through layers and layers of rewriting, into a distant shadow of itself. There is only one God, Pancreator or Panjudicator ; an almost legendary «Conciliator» walked the earth eons ago and is still venerated by the order of the Pelerines ; and priests, rituals, sacred items and guilds abound, as in the Golden Age of Christianity.<br />The other similarity between the two sagas is the spiritual nature of their ultimate magical item. In *The Lord of the Rings*, the object is the ring itself, each successive use of which is a step on the path to damnation - conferring power on Earth in exchange for another fraction of the user's soul, as witnessed in the various states of spiritual decrepitude of those who have succumbed to the temptation. In *The Book of the New Sun*, the most powerful item is the Claw of the Conciliator - «the most valuable relic in existence», a gem that «performs miraculous cures... forgives injuries, raises the dead, draws new races of beings from the soil, purifies lust and so on. All the things [the Conciliator] is supposed to have done himself.»<br />In other words, Tolkien's ring is the Devil ; Wolfe's Claw is God : an interesting symmetry.<br />The texture of the two worlds, however, is very different. Middle Earth seems to be set in a distant past, barely threatened by the first premises of industrialization. Urth on the other hand is our own world millenia hence, a decaying planet waiting for a promised rebirth, frozen in some static medieval social order, incapable of producing any complex artefact except by magic, and borrowing fragments of more advanced technologies from its own past or from the mysterious hierodules, elusive offworlders who only have transactions with selected individuals on Urth and seem to be guiding the world's destiny in some occult fashion.<br />Tolkien was obviously not Wolfe's major influence. The world Severian, his first-person narrator, so entrancingly describes seems to be a mixture of Jack Vance's Dying Earth and Peake's Gormenghast, a labyrinthine urban world rather than an enchanted primeval setting, filled with Lovecraftian horrors and filtered through the literary sensibilities of an admirer of Jorge Luis Borges.<br />So if you know that you will not recapture the wonder of *The Lord of the Rings* by reading any of its countless rehashes, and are seeking for an original voice of comparable eloquence, the *New Sun* cycle is for you : open the gate to the necropolis, unsheathe *Terminus Est* and come drink the analeptic alzabo.<br />*Shadow and Claw* brings together in one volume the first two novels in the series, *The Shadow of the Torturer* and *The Claw of the Conciliator*. It is followed by *Sword and Citadel*, the conclusion of the original series, initially published in two volumes, and *Urth of the New Sun*, which I have not read yet. Wolfe further expanded the saga with the books of the Long Sun and Short Sun, comprising seven volumes so far. And readers who have fallen in love with his universe will also be interested in *The Castle of the Otter* (1983), a collection of essays he wrote on the *New Sun* cycle ; *Lexicon Urthus*, a New Sun encyclopedia ; and GURPS New Sun, the role playing game based on the series.law of the Conciliator*.

That is why Western society is in the same early stages of dysfunction that preceded the fall of Greece and Rome.» Gary T. Amos<br />Like the author of this book, though not from college professors but from my own readings, as I am self-taught in this area, I first accepted and taught the consensus theory of the United States as «the nation of the Enlightenment». In my own case, I was being deluded by my Objectivist mentors, for whom faith being the very poison of reason, and reason the only possible basis for the existence and recognition of individual rights, Christianity cannot have had anything to do with the founding of a nation based on the protection of these rights.<br />To give an idea of the kind of ideas I used to accept, John Ridpath, Objectivism's foremost intellectual historian, recently declared that the theory that «America is rooted in religion» is «a tragic error and a vicious smear of the greatness of America» ; «America was founded on Enlightenment principles, on an Aristotelian perspective of the world, on an understanding of the role of the independent rational mind, and on an understanding of the need for freedom, property, industry, and science. But this has never been widely understood.»<br />Here is not the place to refute this lie and the false dichotomies it is based on : a whole book would be necessary, and this is precisely what Gary T. Amos has offered us with *Defending the Declaration*. Trying to show «how the Bible and Christianity influenced the writing of the Declaration of Independence», Amos, who is presented as holding «a Juris Doctor degree» and degrees «in history and theology», focuses on the political philosophy of the document, devoting one chapter to each of its principles, and tracing their origins to the Bible and Christian thought.<br />Returning to primary sources instead of blithely swallowing the concoctions of secular historians, Amos shows that the political ideas expressed in the Declaration are at least as old as the 11th century and such Catholic scholars as Manegold of Lautenbach, who in 1080 wrote : «No man can make himself king or emperor. The people raise a man above them in this way in order that he may govern them in accordance with right reason, give to each one his own, protect the good, destroy the wicked, and administer justice to every man. But if he violates the contract [pactum] under which he was elected, distrurbing and confounding that which he was established to set in order, then the people is justly and reasonably released from its obligation to obey him. For he was the first to break the faith that bound them together.» (p132.)<br />Such quotations will come as so many shocks to those who believe that Jefferson's political philosophy was no older than the late 17th century and Locke's *Second Treatise on Civil Government* (itself falsely attributed to a Deist, if not to an crypto-atheist.)<br />In addition to its historical and theological lessons, *Defending the Declaration* has given me a lesson in intellectual humility. It has shown me that by deliberately ignoring the Christian tradition, I had made myself blind to the depth and pervasiveness of its influence on the history of Western ideas. And second, that in order to support my own flawed philosophy, I could be just as self-deluded as any other college professor.	2001-12-02

A believer in the «eternal divorce» of religious opinion from civil authority, he was just as wary of the curtailment of individual freedom of conscience by the tyranny of public pressure, castigating the tyrants with clean hands who «altho' the laws will no longer permit them... to burn those who are not exactly of their Creed, ... raise the Hue and cry of Heresy against them, place them under the ban of public opinion, and shut them out from all the kind affections of society.» Afraid of any undue influence on other people's opinions, and jealous of any interference with his own much abused tranquility and reputation, this man who was «in a sect of my own» refrained till the end of his life from any public disclosure of his beliefs in divine matters.<br />However, his silence did not extend to those among his closer friends whom he suspected to be receptive to his unorthodox opinions, and in addition to his correspondence with them, time -seconded by the efforts of the editors of the present volume- has preserved for us two remarkably revealing documents : «The Philosophy of Jesus», which he composed in 1804, and «The Life and Morals of Jesus», which produced about fifteen years later.<br />These two pamphlets, the former in English, and the latter in four languages (Greek, Latin, French and English), evince Jefferson's enduring dedication to what he believed to be the restoration of Christ's authentic life and message. Their method of composition, matured after reading and rereading Joseph Priestley's radical, Unitarian treatises on the subject (such as his *History of the Corruptions of Christianity* and his *History of the Early Opinions Concerning Jesus Christ*), was simply to rewrite the Gospels by cutting out anything smacking of the «idolatry and superstition» of the «vulgar, any reference to the supernatural or to Jesus's divinity, and retaining only the «diamonds» that were his sermons and parables.<br />These two pamphlets tell the story of a child, born to a Jewish couple, who grows up in wisdom, preaches for a short while a reformed (one is almost tempted to say «Enlightened») version of the wicked faith and morality of his people, and is put to death by the civil and religious authorities, a martyr of the unholy alliance of church and state. This man never rose from the dead nor performed any miracles whatsoever, and if he ever claimed to be divinely inspired, the error was excusable : «Elevated by the enthusiasm of a warm and pure heart , conscious of the high strains of an eloquence which had not been taught to him, he might readily mistake the coruscations of his own fine genius for inspirations of a higher order.»<br />Jefferson deeply regretted his revered Jewish reformer died «at about 33, his reason having not yet attained the maximum of it's energy», but he nonetheless considered the system of morality he had begun to develop to be «the most benevolent and sublime that has been ever taught ; and eminently more perfect than those of any of the antient philosophers». He saw in this system the ultimate guarantee of the one value that seemed to matter to him above all others : social «utility» or harmony, the state of generalized peace and goodwill which is achieved when men refrain from initiating force against each other and love each other as Jesus loved them. And he saw in it too, the one common denominator in all the preachings of the myriad Christian sects, the one hope of their ultimate reconciliation and of an end to centuries of religious wars and persecutions : for only dogma, that crazed concoction of corrupt, «overlearned professors» and priests, divided them.<br />But *Jefferson's Extracts From the Gospels* contains much more than reproductions of his heretic selections from the Evangelists. It also includes a highly competent and sensible introduction to Jefferson's religious evolution, from the influence of Bolingbroke to that of Priestley; and, perhaps my favorite section of the volume, a one-hundred-page collection of letters written by or to Jefferson from 1800 to 1825, and revealing his opinion of Plato («a Graecian sophist... dealing out mysticisms incomprehensible to the human mind»), Epicurus (whose doctrines «contain everything rational in moral philosophy which Greece and Rome have left us») and Calvin («a madman... on whom reasoning was wasted. The strait jacket alone was [his] proper remedy») ; of the Quakers (whom we should all imitate, opting to «live without an order of priests, moralise for ourselves, follow the oracle of conscience, and say nothing about what no man can understand nor therefore believe») and the Unitarians (whose «advances towards rational Christianity» would soon convert the whole nation) ; of the Apocalypse («the ravings of a maniac») and the «incomprehensible jargon of the Trinitarian arithmetic, that three are one, and one is three.»<br />I would not recommend this book to anyone seeking answers to the ultimate questions, but if all you want to know is what Jefferson believed in, I cannot imagine a better source.	2001-10-20

Part I covers the ideological background of the creation of the US system of government, evaluating the respective influences of Calvinism, Puritanism, Deism, Freemasonry and science, and presenting the main ideas of the political thinkers who influenced the founders - Locke, Montesquieu, Blackstone, Grotius, Pufendorf, Vattel, and other defenders of the Natural Law tradition.<br />Book II, representing about three fourths of the total volume of the book, examines the religious beliefs of thirteen major founders, as revealed in their lives and writings. Eidsmoe's selection - Witherspoon, Madison, Washington, Hamilton, Jay, Gouverneur Morris, the two Adamses, Patrick Henry, Roger Sherman and those two religiously unorthodox figures, Jefferson and Franklin- is unbiased, containing as it does six Federalists and seven Republicans, and «representing a geographic cross section of New England, Middle Atlantic and Southern States.» The author's cautious conclusion is that eight of these thirteen fouding fathers were «strongly Christian», three were «probably Christian» and two were «probablynot Christian», though members of all three groups believed in a providential God who intervened in men's lives, in a future life of eternal rewards or punishment, and in the unsurpassed moral excellence of the teachings of Jesus.<br />This second book must be praised for the fairness of its conclusions. Eidsmoe is not one of those religious conservatives who seeks to turn every American leader into some pious knight in shining armour. His conclusions are well-supported by the evidence he presents, and do not contradict anything I personally know of the Founders beyond the information he provides. Some of the quotes are particularly fascinating. For instance, John Adams's diaries reveal that in his early twenties he was troubled by the possible existence of intelligent extra-terrestrial beings and their place in God's plan of salvation : «[E]ither God almighty must assume the respective shapes of all these different Species, and suffer the Penalties of their Crimes, or else all these Being[s] must be consigned to everlasting Perdition ?» (p263.)<br />Book III provides an overview of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, stresses the Biblical origins of several formulations and principles of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, and concludes with a series of considerations on the evolution of legal doctrine in the U.S., its possible future developments, and the role Christians should play in preserving original intent. Recognizing the importance of a general understanding of the principles of U.S. government, Eidsmoe directs his readers to the primary sources, such as *The Federalist* or Madison's journals of the Constitutional Convention, and the publications of such organizations as the National Center for Constitutional Studies, the Foundation for American Christian Education, American Vision and the Mayflower Institute.<br />Even though I am no Protestant myself and consider literal Creationism (which Eidsmoe apparently endorses) simplyaberrant, I found *Christianity and the Constitution* to be a sober, cogent and well-informed vindication of America's religious roots, written in a clear and lucid prose.	2001-10-17
US	53093154	R1PWI9NT7FXWOD	0925279579	447555613	Original Intent:	Books	3	79	140	N	N	Weak on specifics, but globally interesting	 The First Amendments wording is explicit : Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion. Yet, amazingly, most of the contemporary rulings currently proceeding from that Amendment involve neither Congress nor the making of a law.  - David Barton.<br />Most books usually present their author and his credentials, but surprisingly, nothing can be learnt of David Barton from this third edition of *Original Intent*. I had to visit the publishers site to learn that he is a former  educator and school administrator  and the founder of Wallbuilders, a group whose purpose is  the restoration of the moral and religious foundation on which America was built . Barton is therefore neither an academic nor a professional lawyer, and his books are avowedly designed to give intellectual ammunition to the Religious Right.<br />Under its former title, *The Myth of Separation*, *Original Intent* was the object of a controversy that cast doubt on the reliability of Bartons scholarship : even though Wallbuilders pride themselves on the accuracy of their research, based on a library of  thousands of first-edition works of our Founding Fathers , Barton admitted that the book contained about a dozen erroneous or unconfirmed quotes, all of which were withdrawn from the present edition.<br />From these facts alone, it is easy to guess that *Original Intent* is not exactly the authoritative work that its serious-looking cover and its 184-page scholarly apparatus suggest.<br />Indeed, the book suffers from two major flaws. First, it is unfocused and poorly structured, as a simple glance at its table of contents will reveal. Divided into eighteen chapters, the book has no overarching argument and seems unable to stick to what its earlier title suggests is its main thesis : that the Founding Fathers erected no such thing as a  wall of separation  between Church and State, and that this wall is a modern creation based on the unconstitutional 1947 Supreme Court decision of *Everson v. Board of Education*.<br />And second, many of the arguments in the book are simply not cogent. Barton is guilty of many logical fallacies and his quotes, however numerous, are often irrelevant to the points he is trying to make. For instance, he reiterates an argument he made in another book, *America : To Pray or not to Pray*, that the victory of legal positivism and the rejection of Biblical Natural Law in the Supreme Court in the years 1962-3 is responsible for higher rates of crime and violent behaviour in the U.S., and a general decline in morality and educational achievement. Even though I do see the two phenomena as related, Bartons argument is simply a case of post hoc ergo propter hoc.<br />Instances of a faulty use of quotations can be found in Bartons use of extracts from eulogies to prove the virtue and piety of selected Founders and his repeated attempts to prove that the Founders held it to be a duty of a good government to support religion by accumulating quotes stating their belief that religion was the necessary support of good government.<br />Some of Bartons facts would also need to be verified. He says that Lockes First Treatise on Civil Government contains 1,349 references to the Bible, and the Second one, 157, while John Eidsmoes figures for the same books are 80 and 22 (*Christianity and the Constitution* p61.)<br />Despite all these flaws, I greatly enjoyed Bartons book and will probably keep it in my library. For if it fails cogently to support many of its specific claims, it does give a much better overall picture of the Founding Fathers positions than the politically correct, liberal volumes Bartons opponents would have us read instead. The selection of quotations and the conclusions reached by the online atheistic groups that deride Bartons scholarship are much more misleading than any of his fallacies, which never seemed to me to involve any outright dihonesty. In addition, whatever inaccuracies the book may contain, they will soon be corrected if the reader follows Bartons wholesome encouragements to read the primary sources of the Founding Era.<br />For a well-reasoned treatment of the opposite, separationist position, I would recommend Leonard Levys *The Establishment Clause* ; and, for a more logical defense of the same position, John Eidsmoes *Christianity and the Constitution*.	2001-10-09

(English and Latin Edition)	Books	5	26	26	N	N	A timeless classic on the moral basis of Civilization	\\"Those who write treatises of natural law, can only declare what their own moral sense and reason dictate in the several cases they state. Such of them as happen to have feelings and a reason coincident with those of the wise and honest part of mankind, are respected and quoted as witnesses of what is morally right or wrong in particular cases. Grotius, Puffendorf, Wolf, and Vattel are of this number.\\" - Thomas Jefferson.<br />Better known under his latin name, Grotius, Hugo de Groot (1583-1645), a Dutch protestant jurist, is generally considered the \\"father of international law\\". Another great father, that of the U.S. Constitution, praised his \\"genius and erudition\\", while U.S. historian George Bancroft saw in \\"the admirable Grotius\\" \\"the first political writer of his age\\", though he was a contemporary of the more widely known Thomas Hobbes. And yet here am I, writing the first Amazon review of his masterpiece, *The Rights of War and Peace*, published in 1625.<br />In his introduction to this first volume of the beautiful collection, \\"Universal Classics\\" , published in 1901 by Walter Dunne, David J. Hill provides a fascinating portrait of this precocious genius : \\"At eight he wrote Latin verses which betrayed poetic talent ; at twelve he entered the University... and at fifteen he defended with he greatest applause Latin theses in philosophy and jurisprudence... at the age of seventeen he was admitted to the bar\\".  As for the present treatise, a document discovered in 1868 revealed that \\"the entire plan and even the arrangement of the *De Jure Belli ac Pacis* were in the mind of Grotius when he was only twenty-one years of age.\\" <br />To summarize the main thrust of his argument, Grotius believed, in Hills apt words, that \\"war is never to be undertaken except to assert rights, and when undertaken is never to be carried on except within the limits of rights.\\" These two fundamental requirements, without which no war can be called just, organize the two majorsections of this three-book work : Book II, which articulates the just causes of war, namely \\"the defense of person and property\\" ; and Book III, which describes the just prosecution of war, by identifying \\"what is lawful in war.\\" (The two quotes in this sentence are the titles of the first chapters of each book.)<br />But to reduce this treatise to these two questions would be unfair to the scope of Grotiuss intellect. For the Dutch jurist digs deep, not only philosophically, as when he discusses the foundation of property rights, the moral nature of oaths or the relationship between the law of nature, Gods commandments and positive law ; but culturally, offering a magisterial survey of mankinds treasuries of knowledge and wisdom, from Scripture to Homer, Aristotle, Thucydides, Livy, Ulpian, Justinian, Cicero and Seneca, among others.<br />*The Rights of War and Peace* should be on the reading list of all American patriots, who cannot ignore such a landmark in the Natural Law tradition. Grotiuss discussion of the right of self-defense is strong ammunition for a libertarian interpretation of the Second Amendment. And his treatment of \\"pirates and robbers\\" applies perfectly to modern terrorists, those \\"atrocious malefactors... [whose] calling... is to extort terms by fear.\\"  Reading this book in the week that followed the destruction of the World Trade Center, I was fascinated by its relevance to the whole situation, and how its clarity can help refute the whitewashing of bin Ladens acts by some perverted muslim intellectuals, preying on a West disarmed by moral relativism, ignorance and confusion.<br />Of course, Grotius is not \\"modern\\" in all his opinions. He does not seem to recognize a peoples right to rebel against an unjust monarch, for instance, though a James Otis managed to quote him in support of American independence. But Russell Kirk, in a passage of his *The Roots of American Order* praising Montesquieu, went too far in reducing him tothe idea \\"that a conqueror has the right to slaughter or perpetually enslave a whole people whose armies he has defeated.\\"  Doesnt Grotius write that \\"No one can be justly killed by design, except by way of legal punishment, or to defend our lives, and preserve our property, when it cannot be effected without his destruction\\"? Doesnt he beautifully affirm that \\"it is the characteristic of bravery to esteem our opponents as enemies, while contending with victory, and to treat them as men, when conquered\\"?<br />Let us not distort the thinking of this prodigious individual by dropping the context and putting an undue emphasis on the errors he shared with his time. Let us rather concur with James Madisons assessment : \\"Grotius is not unjustly considered, as in some respects, the father of the modern code of nations. Great, however, as his authority deservedly may be, it yields, in a variety of instances, to that of later jurists; who, to all the lights furnished by this luminary, have added those derived from their own sources, and from the improvements made in the intercourse and happiness of nations.\\"<br />(Note : The editor, A. C. Campbell, made a few cuts in the original text, mostly of what he considered to be redundant or too technical or obscure paragraphs, but included a certain number of interesting footnotes drawing parallels between some of Grotius's points and the writings of Vattel and Blackstone, through whom, when not directly, Grotius influenced the Founding Fathers.)	2001-09-23

It is divided into two parts : « Emotion » and « The Nature of Psychological Categories », the second of which contains a fifty-page digression on « natural kinds » with only a thin theoretical connection to the main topic of the book.<br />Griffiths does a good job reviewing the major modern theories of emotion and showing how the least defective of them do explain some of what folk psychology means by « emotion ». But his main thesis is that the latter category has to be rejected because it does not « carve nature at the joints » and actually covers a very heterogeneous collection of psychological phenomena. Griffiths proposes to replace it with several distinct categories like « affect programs », basic, stereotyped, transcultural and even transspecific responses ; more complex emotions that vary across cultures ; « socially sustained pretenses » based on some form of self-deception ; and « moods », a concept he parachutes in the last chapter.<br />The book contains a few interesting remarks on the nature / nurture dichotomy, explaining how even genetically encoded behaviour is not immune to environmental influences.<br />The more epistemological chapters, however, are typical of modern philosophy in their embarrassment with reality, their vacuous neologisms and their wonderfully droll verbal contorsions (« My concept of cat is about cats because its existence depends on cats by the particular kind of causal pathway appropriate to being about »). A particularly funny by-product of the absurdities blurted forward by modern philosophers is that commonsense gets to be « discovered » by even hipper philosophers who refer to it with such obscure jargon that you might not even recognize grandpa's down-to-earth wisdom. For instance, « Boyd 1991 » originated the principle of the « metaphysical innocence of theory construction », which tells us among other things that « the decision to classify certain events fifty years ago as child abuse has no effect on those events because no natural causal mechanism can reach them from the present. »<br />My favorite new concept is that of « causal homeostasis », which Griffiths introduces in an attempt to get rid of reality in his account of natural kinds. A category is said to have causal homeostasis if the correlations it identifies among its referents have « some underlying explanation that makes [the category] projectable », i.e. if the « theoretical significance » of these correlations is such that they can be extrapolated to « unobserved instances ». Apart from the jargon, this is not altogether silly. However, Griffiths uses it to give the concept of essence a « less metaphysical » (i.e. less reality-oriented) definition as « any theoretical structure that accounts for the projectability of a category »...<br />As a review of the psychological theories currently in vogue, this book can serve as a starting point for an exploration of these theories, if you really have to. But this is the most I can say for it.	2001-06-27

It is divided into five books: Aegean Prelude (3500-1000 B.C.); The Rise of Greece (1000-480 B.C.); The Golden Age (480-399 B.C.); The Decline and Fall of Greek Freedom (399-322 B.C.); and The Hellenistic Dispersion (322-146 B.C.).<br />Unlike the first volume, which (among other things) devoted from one to three hundred pages to the histories of India, China and Japan from the origins to the 1930s, this second volume, though shorter than the first (670 pages, not counting the bibliography and index), is much more focused and can afford to narrate in greater detail the political and military events that make up most of the bulk of traditional history books.<br />As if suffering from an excess of testosterone, Greek civilization was bellicose, extroverted, virile and sensualistic, down to its very modern hysteria over spectator sports, but it redeemed itself with a plethora of literary and philosophical geniuses after whom very little significant intellectual progress remained to be made: at best, we can boast improved measurements, judging by Anaxagoras's wonderful statement that &quot;the sun is a red-hot masss many times larger than the Peloponnesus&quot;.<br />A recurring phrase in the book is &quot;so old is...&quot;. Between them, for instance, the systems of Democritus, Empedocles and Epicurus contained virtually the whole philosophical import of modern science. &quot;Realism and nominalism, idealism and materialism, monotheism, pantheism, and atheism, feminism and communism, the Kantian critique and the Schopenauerian despair, the primitivism of Rousseau and the immoralism of Nietzsche, the synthesis of Spencer and the psychoanalysis of Freud- all the dreams and wisdom of philosophy are here, in the age and land of its birth&quot; (p670.)<br />Durant, the author of an acclaimed &quot;Story of Philosophy&quot;, is particularly brilliant at essentializing the various philosophical systems of the period. For instance, he explains in a footnote that &quot;in Plato's theory of ideas, Heracleitus and Parmenides are reconciled: Heracleitus is right, and flux is true, in the world of sense; Parmenides is right, and changeless unity is true, in the world of ideas&quot; (p516) - a brilliant remark which I thought Leonard Peikoff had been the first to make.<br />Regretfully, however, Durant underestimates the philosophical stature of Aristotle, proposing to &quot;consider him chiefly as a scientist&quot; and noting almost immediately that &quot;it is in biology that [he was] most at home&quot;: &quot;All in all, the *History of Animals* is Aristotle's greatest work&quot;. Durant's pragmatic and often derogatory conception of philosophy (in volume three, he refers for instance to &quot;the deserts of logic and metaphysics&quot;) and his defensible conviction that &quot;there are no beginnings&quot; may be partly to blame for this injustice which, anyway, does not seem to affect his solidarity with the &quot;master of those who know&quot;. Indeed, it is hard not to perceive self-reference in such statements as: &quot;When a man covers a vast field many errors may be forgiven him if the result adds to our comprehension of life.... When all deductions have been made, [Aristotle] still remains... a comforting inspiration to those who labor to bring man's scattered knowledge together into perspective and understanding.&quot; (p537)<br />Will Durant's *The Story of Civilization* is a brilliant illustration of the excellence a scholar can achieve with the best liberal education and a long-term acquaintance with the greatest historians from Herodotus to the present. Durant's opinion of Sallust (in volume 3) may be applied to him (&quot;He deepened his narratives with philosophical commentary and psychological analysis and carved out a style of epigrammatic compactness and vivid rapidity which became a model&quot;) as well as the compliment that he is never boring, probably because he was an academic who did not write for his peers (as he comments on the Hellenistic period: &quot;Poets began to write for poets, and became artificial; scholars began to write for scholars, and became dull.&quot;)<br />(Note: to compensate for the dearth of illustrations in the book, I had to rely on the maps provided in the Herodotus/Thucydides volume from Britannica's *Great Books of the Western World*; and bought copies of Gisela Richter's *A Handbook of Greek Art* and Peter Connolly's *Ancient Life in Classical Greece and Rome*, both of which were highly recommended to me.)	2001-05-25

They even befriend a young, abused pauper, Bill, whom Ransome, in a Dickensian vein, portrays more lovingly than any of the recurring characters. And quite significantly, instead of referring to such novels as *Robinson Crusoe* or *Treasure Island*, the children (and especially the one I identify with the most, Titty) are now enthralled byHakluyt's and Columbus's accounts of their voyages.<br />*Peter Duck* may lack the simplicity and freshness of the first volume, as well as the feeling that nothing serious could happen to the children, but it is a wonderful adventure story which I wish I had read (or been read) as a child. And for those who don't know Jack about sailing, it is also very didactic, containing several explanatory illustrations and footnotes by Captain Nancy herself.	2001-05-09
US	53093154	R1K8WPGL6W00HR	0736655409	869892259	Our Oriental Heritage : Vol.1 : Parts One&Two	Books	5	176	184	N	N	The spirit of the Enlightenment lives	&quot;A nation is born stoic, and dies epicurean.&quot; - Will Durant<br />*Our Oriental Heritage* is the first volume in Will and Ariel Durant's eleven-volume history of civilization from the Sumerians to the Napoleonic era - the work of a lifetime, or rather two of them, as its publication spanned no less four decades (1935-1975) and eight years were spent on these first nine hundred pages alone.<br />Although well integrated by Durant's systematic approach, *Our Oriental Heritage* is actually four books in one (or five, if you include the opening ninety-page essay on the nature of civilization): the first one deals with the Near East -  Sumeria, Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria, Judea and Persia - from the fourth millenium to the third century B.C. (275p); the second, with India from the Vedas to Gandhi, who was then still alive and, well, maybe not kicking (245p); the third, with China from the &quot;Age of the Philosophers&quot; to Sun Yat Sen (190p); and the fourth, with Japan from its mythical Shinto birth to the invasion of Manchuria (105p).<br />The organization of the book is more thematic than chronological. Though Durant does divide the histories of the various civilizations into periods and tries to follow their evolution, he limits himself to well-chosen historical highlights, seeking rather to understand the soul of each civilization by an analysis of its major cultural achievements. His focus is always on the big picture: as the title indicates, he is trying to assess the contribution of each major civilization to the progress of the human species (which he misleadingly refers to as &quot;our race&quot;), and never shies away from the kind of inter-cultural comparisons which our relativistic age stigmatizes (of Indian drama, he says for instance that &quot;we cannot rank [it] on a plane with that of Greece or Elizabethan England; but it compares favorably with the theatre of China or Japan.&quot;)<br />Durant sees civilization as a complex of eight elements(economic, political, moral, religious, scientific, philosophical, literary and artistic) which serve as his conceptual framework to describe each era. His definitions of morality and religion reveal the most about his own outlook: the first he sees as merely instrumental to the cohesion and survival of the collective, defining it as &quot;a law built into the spirit, and generating... that sense of right and wrong, that order and discipline of desire, without which a society disintegrates into individuals, and falls forfeit to some coherent state&quot;; and the second he defines most skeptically and cynically as &quot;the use of man's supernatural beliefs for the consolation of suffering, the elevation of character and the strengthening of social instincts and order.&quot;<br />Durant's own philosophy is not stated explicitly, but it is certainly less corrupt than his calling this discipline &quot;that brave stupidity&quot; might suggest. Of all the philosophical schools presented in the volume, he seems to have the most sympathy for Confucianism, which is perfectly understandable given his conception of the functions of morality and religion, while the Upanishads, he says, &quot;are full of absurdities and contradictions, and occasionally... anticipate all the wind of Hegelian verbiage&quot;.<br />Maybe Durant could best be defined as &quot;Voltairean&quot;: his project is reminiscent of the Encyclopedie, and seems to be his own answer to Voltaire, who wanted &quot;to know what were the steps by which men passed from barbarism to civilization&quot;; the ninth volume of the series, dealing with the Enlightenment, is reverentially entitled *The Age of Voltaire*, and the complete works of the philosophe (in 32 volumes!) are one of the fifty or so bibliographical references Durant specifically recommends for further study.<br />Unfortunately, Durant's Voltaireanism also extends to his politics, and he seems to have a peculiar fondness for so-called &quot;enlighteneddespots&quot;, the measure of their enlightenment being dictated by what we might call the author's acadian liberalism. Each time he finds an instance of a well-oiled bureaucratic machinery, fixing prices, taxing every single profession, managing the whole economy and throwing in a few welfare measures, he is ecstatic. He does care about &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;civil rights&quot;, but he has absorbed so many marxist fallacies (about &quot;exploitation&quot; and &quot;imperialism&quot; mostly) that he cannot help praising the planned economies of the oriental tyrants and always ascribes the disasters they caused to the ill-will of their opponents or some unfortunate combination of natural circumstances. I guess he must have been very satisfied with America's &quot;enlightened&quot; despot of the moment.<br />But politics and economics are only two of the seven elements of civilization, and Durant's treatment of the other five is brilliant. My main regret, actually, is that he spent too little time on the histories of China and Japan (he himself apologizes for his &quot;unwilling haste&quot;.) The Ming Dynasty is dealt with in one paragraph, as are all the classics of the Chinese novel, which Durant lists without any summary, euphemistically commenting that &quot;they are recommended to the reader's leisurely old age.&quot; As for Japan, neither Miyamoto's *Book of Five Rings* nor the *Heike Monogatari* are mentioned. I also think Korea would have deserved a chapter of its own, instead of being treated as Japan's distant cultural father.<br />But a book that should have been longer is a book that deserves to be read. In the words of the *New York Times*, *Our Oriental Heritage* is a &quot;magnificent and monumental&quot; work, which will appeal to those who are bored with today's hyper-specialized and minutely detailed factual history, and believe with Kaibara Ekken, a Japanese philosopher of the 17th century, that &quot;The aim of learning is not merely to widen knowledge but to form character. Its object is to make us true men, rather than learned men.&quot; (p869)	2001-05-05

That was the thing that spoilt *Robinson Crusoe*. In the end he came home. There never ought to be an end.&quot; - Arthur Ransome.<br />Even though I am quite knowledgeable about children's literature, I had never heard of Arthur Ransome, until Helen McCarthy's book on the master of Japanese animation taught me that this English author of the early twentieth century was one of Hayao Miyazaki's favorite writers for children, together with Rosemary Sutcliff and Philippa Pearce. As the director of such masterpieces as *My Neighbour Totoro*, *Kiki's Delivery Service* and *Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind*, Miyazaki had to know what he was talking about, so I ordered the first half of this twelve-volume series, based only on his opinion and that of Amazon's enthusiastic reviewers. Knowing that the British even have their &quot;Arthur Ransome Society&quot;, &quot;formed in 1990 with the aim of celebrating his life and his books&quot;, also made me very confident in the power of his novels.<br />As I read the first few dozen pages of the book, I first thought Ransome might have been a little overrated by readers who had grown up with him and were merely being nostalgic. I also had to acknowledge that I am not an outdoors person, and that camping and sailing have never had much appeal to me: I'd rather stay at home with a good book. So at first, *Swallows and Amazons* merely felt like a cute story about four brothers and sisters spending a few days on a little island on some unidentified English lake, putting up their tents, preparing meals and exploring their surroundings, their vision of the world transfigured by the influence of such novels as *Treasure Island* and *Robinson Crusoe*.<br />But gradually, the novel grew on me. I started to be drawn into this little universe, rediscovering the curiosity and the sheer joy of being alive I had experienced as a kid: the same delight at watching birds go about their business, being caught in a thunderstorm or playing the part of whatever hero I fancied.<br />*Swallows and Amazons* is not a highly introspective book, but it brilliantly manages to capture the sense of life of pre-adolescent children. Most interesting is the protagonists' use of the word &quot;native&quot;: at first, I thought they were merely applying the word to the locals, as they were pretending to be explorers on an uncharted sea. But then I realized the concept had many layers, and actually signified any person - child or adult - who would not participate in the world of make-believe children live in. Talk or any other behaviour can be &quot;native&quot;: it merely has to spoil the fun by its practicality and lack of inspiration.<br />I can understand why the politically correct crowd should boo Ransome's novels. Of course, his characters are white and middle-class, but there is also a deeper epistemological reason at work: the children in these books are shown to be doing exactly the same kind of thing as the advocates of PC, i.e. renaming the various objects in their environment in order to indulge in a kind of shared fantasy. Uncle Jim is turned into &quot;Captain Flint&quot;, ginger beer into &quot;grog&quot; and water lillies into octopuses. Therefore, quite unexpectedly (and anachronistically), the novel can be read as a parody of political correctness, as even children are never completely fooled by their own word games and are quite capable of reverting to &quot;native talk&quot; whenever the situation calls for it.<br />If you enjoyed Richard Donner's *The Goonies*, *Swallows and Amazons* will take you on the same kind of juvenile adventure, only it is not a Spielberg production of the mid-1980s, but an English novel of 1930. I particularly recommend it to Objectivist parents who are looking for good books for their children, because it presents independent and honest heroes without ever praising religion or the virtue of self-sacrifice.f-sacrifice.	2001-04-27

To paraphrase a famous review of Louis Cha's much superior *The Deer and the Cauldron*, *Bridge of Birds* is &quot;Ancient China meets Monty Python&quot;, only Monty Python makes me laugh. It is to *The Monkey King* what *The Life of Brian* is to the Gospels. So anyone looking for the beauty, complexity and refinement of Ancient Zhong Guo will be disappointed; Hughart laughs at everything, including mutilation and rape: &quot;Lady Wu, whose beauty was said to rival that of the semilegendary Queen Feiyen, was carried into the bushes by a creature who had no ears or nose, and whose eyes were as yellow as his teeth. We all have our little weaknesses, but I must question the judgment of Cut-Off-Their-Balls Wang when he abandoned his fellow hooded monks to disport in the bushes with Lady Wu. He missed a great deal of excitement.&quot;<br />But the primary target of Hughart's &quot;humour&quot; is China herself, of which he seems to have a rather patronizing and derogatory opinion, best summarized by one of his characters, Master Li: &quot;Take a large bowl. Fill it with equal measures of fact, fantasy, history, mythology, science, superstition, logic and lunacy. Darken the mixture with bitter tears, brighten it with howls of laughter, toss in three thousand years of civilization, bellow *kan pei* - which means 'dry cup'- and drink the dregs... You will be Chinese.&quot;<br />Even more irritating is the fact that the novel, which is supposed to be written by the protagonist, Number Ten Ox, makes no effort at capturing the style or outlook of the era. Sometimes, Hughart even forgets his narrator is a Chinese of the Tang Dynasty, and has him write such anachronistic comments as: &quot;The abbot was dancing a jig while he bellowed, 'Namo Kuanshiyin Boddhisattva Mahasattva', which is how good Buddhists say 'hallelujah'.&quot;<br />As for the style, it is simply atrociously amateurish. Hughart's idea of speeding up the pace is to write a series of independent clauses connected by a series of and's. His similes are all cliches: from afar, people look like ants; and clouds resemble sails speeding across the sky. Fat people invariably are &quot;enormously big&quot;. And to describe a gargantuan meal, Hughart finds nothing more digestible than to pile up thirteen subordinate clauses introduced by the phrase &quot;which was followed by&quot;.<br />*Bridge of Birds* is a typical product of modern culture: a hip, glib and totally inconsequential novel, designed to entertain but utterly devoid of any deeper meaning of philosophical import, and written in a lazy, unpolished style without the slightest trace of poetry or genuine love of anything. I am even almost certain that if Hughart set his book in a &quot;China that never was&quot;, it was merely to save himself the effort of historical research.<br />Ayn Rand once said that &quot;the best drawn character in anyone's writing is the author himself&quot; (*The Art of Fiction, p120). Well, I guess I don't have much sympathy for the novel's best drawn character.	2001-04-22

You are writing because you *want* to write; and if you do not want to, you do not have to, neither today not ever. Remind yourself that it is all for your own happiness, and if you truly dislike the activity, do not try it. Writing is too difficult to do with a half-intention.&quot; - Ayn Rand.<br />Books that purport to teach you how to write abound, so why pick Ayn Rand's?<br />First, she herself was a master of the art of writing. And just as the unequaled excellence of *The Fountainhead* and *Atlas Shrugged* should make anyone curious to read *The Art of Fiction*, her demonstrated ability to combine logic with emotional power in countless articles is the best recommendation one could find for the present volume. *The Art of Nonfiction* is a reliable guide for the same reasons that  books on martingales written from a trailer are not.<br />Second, not only was Ayn Rand an experienced and highly talented non-fiction writer, but she also had the kind of mind that enabled her to make sense of her ability. Just because someone can do something does not mean he can explain how he does it. Dogs can catch balls, but they are poor teachers of ballistics, and many writers, when it comes to explaining their art, are no better.<br />What makes Rand a first-rate teacher of the art of non-fiction is first of all her epistemology. The author of *An Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology*, Rand developed a theory of concepts which she summarizes here in very simple terms: &quot;only concretes exist... abstractions are merely a method of classifying concretes&quot;. Based on this theory, she formed her concepts deliberately and consciously, and she had an uncanny ability, best described by her student and heir Leonard Peikoff, to &quot;oscillate&quot; between various levels of abstractions, from simple percepts to the highest &quot;abstractions from abstractions&quot;. Such a capacity she shows here to be essential to non-fiction writing.<br />Ayn Rand also laid the foundations for a science she called &quot;psycho-epistemology&quot;, which she defined as &quot;the study of man's cognitive processes from the aspect of the interaction between the conscious mind and the unconscious&quot;. This science is absolutely necessary to understand the process of non-fiction writing, which is essentially a collaboration between the conscious and the sub-conscious - the former dealing mostly with the outline and editing stages, and the latter, with the actual writing. The whole secret of Rand's writing technique is the skillful management of these co-workers in the writing process.<br />*The Art of Nonfiction* is a slim but dense and very well organized volume which will be of particular interest not only to professional writers, but to amateurs, from the student with a paper to draft to the techno-freak who wants his webpage actually to be, and not merely look, good. As for those whose opinion of Ayn Rand has been entirely shaped by about half a century of smears, they will be astounded by the clarity, the honesty and the benevolence of the woman they have been lied about for so long.	2001-04-22
US	53093154	R1LLIHGK3Y3SRL	0781261368	112705211	George Washington (2 Volumes) (BCL1 - U.S. History)	Books	5	7	10	N	N	Biography at its best and most brilliant	&quot;The true moral, if any, to be drawn from [Washington's] life, is that one should dress as magnificently as possible and indulge in every luxury available, including the dance, the theatre, the ballroom, hunting, fishing, racing, drinking and gambling, observing in all of them temperance, justice, honesty and pride, while avoiding excess and loss of dignity. And a fine code it is.&quot; - Rupert Hughes.<br />Despite my general admiration for the Founding Fathers, George Washington is not a figure of whom I would have contemplated reading a multi-volume biography, at least not until I had already done the same for Jefferson and Madison, to whom I feel much closer in temperament, and had plenty of time to spare. I thought Richard Brookhiser's informative but unexceptional biography of him (*Founding Father: Rediscovering George Washington*) contained everything I would ever want to know about the man.<br />But then, while reading Kenneth Roberts' literary autobiography, *I Wanted to Write*, I came across the following remark, extracted from the August 22, 1931 entry of his diary: &quot;Read from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. in Volume 2 of Rupert Hughes's *George Washington*- history at its best and most brilliant.&quot;<br />Given the scantiness of Roberts' praise of historians, and my own steady admiration for him, this was enough to make me order the three volumes of Hughes' biography right away.<br />It is composed of three volumes, covering the first five decades of Washington's life and leaving out the last two, which include his presidency. They are titled respectively: &quot;The Human Being and the Hero, 1732-1762&quot;, &quot;The Rebel and the Patriot 1762-1777&quot; and &quot;The Savior of the States 1777-1781&quot;. So far, I have only read Volume 1, but it is enough to make me second Roberts' verdict about the book: not only is it well-researched and reliable, but it goes beyond those virtues of small books and rises to the level of great literature, rich with thekind of wisdom that makes you feel you are going to return to it again and again for more than just facts.<br />Hughes himself was a friend of Roberts. They first met at MI-4 during World War I. As Roberts writes in his autobiography: &quot;It was my great good fortune to have as a commanding officer Major Rupert Hughes... If Major Hughes could have been given as free a hand with Military Intelligence as General Donovan was later given with O.S.S., the United States would long ago have had a genuine Intelligence Section.&quot; One also learns that at that time, Hughes was deaf, the father of two children, and &quot;working furiously on galley proofs of a novel.&quot; Later on, he introduced Roberts to the man who would become his lifelong best friend, Booth Tarkington, and helped him out with his historical novels of the Revolutionary War by lending him volumes from his own well-endowed library.<br />Actually, Hughes has authored exactly the same kind of biography of Washington that Roberts would have written had ever ventured into this area, hence the latter's admiration: like Roberts in *Trending Into Maine* or *The Battle of Cowpens*, Hughes often prefers to let source documents speak for themselves; he has a writer's eye for the telling detail, for factual consistency and for the complexity of the human soul; and he is particularly brilliant at debunking myths and rescuing the truth from a jungle of misapprehensions and outright fabrications.<br />I was also particularly seduced by his personal philosophy, the benevolence of which is evinced by his view of business and money-making. But for its ambivalence, the following passage would sound almost Randian: &quot;It has been overlong the custom to assume that epic poetry flies out of the window the moment business comes in at the door. We should realize the truer truth that all great business men and business triumphs have been, when understood, epic in virtues, epic in sins, aglow with poetic imaginations bothof horror and beauty, tragedy and triumph.&quot;<br />Hughes' biography of Washington is a brilliant portrait of a multi-faceted man - military commander, land speculator, slave owner, lover and bon vivant. In addition to its richly detailed depictions of military life and military campaigns, it contains a very enlightening annex about Washington's religious fervour (or lack thereof) and a haunting treatment of his enduring passion for Sally Fairfax, the married woman he was more ardently in love with than he ever was with his own wife.	2001-03-30

Still searching for the eight copies of the *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections*, about which much more is now revealed, he visits the northern Wutai Mountains, where evil Tibetan lamas try to kidnap the lost father of the young Manchu Emperor; confronts the perils of Snake Island, where he is initiated into the Sect of the Mystic Dragon; stays at the Shaolin Monastery, from whose assortment of rather ridiculous monks he does not seek to learn much kung fu; and is finally sent to the south-western Yunnan province, where a conspiracy is afoot to overthrow the Qing dynasty.<br />The first one hundred pages of this Second Book are perhaps the most addictive of the two volumes and the action remains fast-paced throughout. However, Trinket's assumption of more and more false identities and his rapid promotion in the various milieux he infiltrates tend to become a little formulaic. The general tone is one of derision, and the only truly noble figure in the whole series is the White Nun, who might have been interpreted, in another era, by a Xu Feng or a Cheng Pei Pei. As for Trinket's increasingly sophisticated Machiavellianism, it is often disturbing, as he murders enemy after enemy in the most dastardly ways (usually by poison or back stabs), disposing of the bodies with his &quot;decomposing powder&quot;. Even his sex life, and particularly his sado-masochistic relationship with the berserk Princess Ning, is repulsive. I am not talking of light B&amp;D, which I would have rather enjoyed (especially with the woman on top), but of the heavier stuff of which the following might give you an idea: &quot;Dear Laurie [Trinket's false identity as an Imperial Eunuch], Prince Laurie, you can go on beating me if you like, but please first put my joints back!&quot;. And I am not mentioning in what horribly mutilatedcondition Trinket finds one of his friends at the end of the novel. Had the tone been a little less over-the-top and tongue-in-cheek, such scenes would have sickened me.<br />Nevertheless, *The Deer and the Cauldron* remains an extremely enjoyable read, and I hope Oxford University Press will not fail to publish the Third Book. I aspire some day to find more uplifting, mystical and literary martial arts novels, in the vein of the King Hu movies I worship, but in the meantime, Louis Cha (a.k.a. Jin Yong)  is the closest literary equivalent I have found to a really good kung fu film.	2001-03-23

Apart from the first two books of *The Deer and the Cauldron* (and of course such classics as *The Water Margin*), I have only been able to find a translation of Li Shanji's (a.k.a. Huanzhulouzhu) *Blades From the Willows* (Wellsweep Press, 1991), which I found so dumb I could not finish it (it is actually closer to the worst Japanese monster TV series than to any martial arts movie from Hong Kong); and a French translation of a novel by Gu Long (Picquier, 1990), which was better, but not particularly memorable.<br />Given this lack of competition, I would not be paying *The Deer and the Cauldron* much of a compliment if I said it was by far the best martial arts novel I have ever read, so I will simply state that it is the most addictive novel I have read since the early 1990s, when I discovered *The Fountainhead* and *Atlas Shrugged*.<br />Louis Cha's (Jin Yong's) *The Deer and the Cauldron* is the story of Trinket (Wei Xiaobao), the thirteen-year-old son of a Yangzhou whore, in the Eastern province of Jiangsu, who finds himself caught up in the political intrigues of the early Manchu era, in the mid-1660's. A crafty, lazy, unprincipled opportunist, Trinket ingratiates himself with a member of the Triads, which in those days were not a mafia, but secret loyalist societies opposing Manchu rule and seeking to restore the Ming Dynasty; and becomes friends with the Emperor of China himself, another lad of thirteen. Set mostly in Beijing's Forbidden City, the novel involves a quest for copies of a sacred buddhist text, the *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections*, whose importance is only revealed in volume two; an evil Imperial eunuch seeking vengeance for murders most horrid; and power squabbles among the various Triads.<br />The novel is written in a very lucid and unostentatious style, focusing on telling the story rather than on describing the settings. Louis Cha's main interest is in the plot of this wonderfully convoluted tale of deception and false identities: he sees his genre as a Chinese cousin of the historical fictions of Walter Scott, Robert Louis Stevenson, Alexandre Dumas and Prosper Merimee. Unfortunately, the use of foul language, the frequent references to bodily functions and the numerous murders and mutilations described make the novel unsuitable for younger readers, who might otherwise have enjoyed this brilliant adventure (the most recurring term of abuse is &quot;turtle&quot; which, one learns in the glossary of volume 2, is a euphemism for penis; as for &quot;tamardy&quot;, I haven't a clue.)<br />The Second Book of this excellent series (Louis Cha's last work) was published in 1999, also by Oxford University Press, and if you hate cliffhangers, you might want to buy both volumes at once. The translator, John Minford, who also worked on the Penguin edition of *The Story of the Stone*, initially intended to publish a third volume, together with two other works of Cha's, *Book and Sword* and *Eagles and Heroes*. I sincerely hope none of these projects has been abandoned or postponed.<br />(This volume contains a map of Ancient China, a glossary of people and places and a glossary of terms - all of them extremely helpful.)	2001-03-17

Robbins defines Clark's philosophy as &quot;scripturalism&quot;, a doctrine according to which &quot;all our thoughts- there are no exceptions- are to be brought into conformity to Scripture, for all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are contained in Scripture.&quot; Among the corollaries of this position are the idea that evolution is &quot;the greatest superstition of the twentieth century&quot;, and an extremely negative (Popperian) view of science, according to which &quot;all the laws of science are false, and all have the same probability: zero&quot; because they are &quot;conclusions of logically fallacious arguments&quot;.<br />In Objectivist terms, he is a pure intrinsicist: he believes that we have access to infallible propositional truths, which are delivered to us directly from the mind of God via Scripture, and that all our knowledge either comes directly from Revelation or from logical deductions from it. A pure rationalist, too, he totally rejects empirical evidence as a possible basis for knowledge, and reduces logic to deduction, denying even the possibility of induction (&quot;Truth cannot be derived from something non-propositional, such as 'observations'. Unless one starts with propositions, one cannot end with propositions.&quot;)<br />Most people - and especially most Objectivists - would be tempted to dismiss him as a wacky fundamentalist, but I personally respect Christians and even admire some Catholics, and I even share some of Robbins' ethics and politics, so I was willing to listen.<br />Actually, *Ayn Rand and the Close of her System* contains excellent points against Objectivism, some of which I had already arrived at by my own thinking. I particularly liked, for instance, Robbins's argument that what the &quot;primacy of existence&quot; actually means is &quot;the primacy of unconsciousness&quot;; his identification of the bias inherent in the &quot;indestructible robot&quot; example used to justify the concept of life as the root of value (the robot is assumed to be impassible and unchangeable); or the argument that Rand's ethics would &quot;seem to permit, if not require, murderers to fight against their just punishment&quot; and is &quot;completely compatible with a pro-death, pro-suicide point of view&quot; - among many other highly interesting points.<br />I am not saying that Robbins has refuted Objectivism, only that some of his points corroborated or even refined my own understanding of the problems of the philosophy and raised objections I am currently unable to answer. Of course, not every argument is of a high caliber. Robbins occasionally resorts to ad hominem, sarcasm or straw man arguments. Moreover, even though he does understand many of the points he discusses, he is prey to a certain number of false alternatives, assuming for instance that the non-intrinsicist is necessarily a Kantian subjectivist or that a volitional theory of consciousness must necessarily exclude the possibility of automatic processes at all levels, including the sub-conscious.<br />In fact, if true, Robbins' critique would be devastating not only for Objectivism, but for modern science (including psychology and psychiatry, which he rejects as &quot;pseudo-science&quot; and &quot;witchdoctory&quot;) and  the whole empiricist tradition in philosophy. He is particularly virulent against Aristotle, whom, contrary to Rand who saw in him &quot;the first of our Founding Fathers&quot;, he calls an &quot;explicit totalitarian&quot; and a &quot;fascist&quot;. But Rand's interpretation is vindicated in such Objectivist works as Robert Mayhew's *Aristotle's Criticism of Plato's Republic* or F. D. Miller's *Nature, Justice and Rights in Aristotle's Politics*. As for Robbins' attacks on the Objectivist politics, it seems to focus on rather careless statements of the theory, and might not be as effective against the more scholarly derivation of the Objectivist position in Tara Smith's *Moral Rights and Political Freedom*.<br />Even though Robbins' own point of view is untenable and he is not always a very nice person, I think his book is worthy of close scrutiny and deserves a systematic Objectivist answer.	2001-03-11

I also knew that his book *Steel Titan* (1975), was the major source Burton Folsom used for his chapter on Charles Schwab in *The Myth of the Robber Barons*. So when I opened my copy of his *In Defense of the Corporation*, I knew I would be in good company.<br />The book can be roughly subdivided into two halves. The first half is mostly an historical argument against the &quot;concession theory&quot; of the corporation, showing that the conception of the corporation as a &quot;creature of the state&quot; operating by privilege is an anachronism inherited by mistake from the feudal era. On the contrary, Hessen defends what he calls the &quot;inherence theory&quot;, which shows the corporation to be reducible to the individual rights of its owners.<br />I was particularly interested in the refutation of the attacks on the so-called &quot;privilege&quot; of limited liability, which can even be found in the writings of such a conservative historian as Clarence B. Carson. Hessen shows that there are two kinds of limited liability. The first one, limited financial liability, can be explained quite simply as an implied contract between the corporation and its creditors. And the second one, limited liability for torts, is shown to be perfectly reasonable as far as shareholders are concerned.<br />The second part of the book is a defense of the freedom of incorporation against attacks made by Ralph Nader in two books he published in the 1970s. Nader advocated the federal incorporation of &quot;large&quot; corporations and the turning of their right to engage in interstate commerce into a privilege which the federal government could then use as a stick to make them comply with socialist legislation.<br />Hessen brilliantly exposes the illogic and arbitrariness of these recommendations, and casts doubt on the value of Nader's scholarship by demonstrating how he resorted to &quot;phantom footnotes&quot; (&quot;that is, citations which prove to be unverifiable and either bogus or deceptive&quot;) and used unreliable sources to support his claims.<br />Against Nader, whom he shows to be another modern disciple of Rousseau, Hessen concludes that corporations &quot;are created and sustained by freedom of association and contract, that the source of freedom is not governmental permission but individual rights, and that these rights are not suddenly forfeited when a business grows beyond some arbitrarily defined size.&quot;<br />Robert Hessen, who recognizes his &quot;intellectual indebtedness to Ayn Rand&quot;, refers to her *Virtue of Selfishness* and quotes from her *Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal*, has written here an essentialized and conceptually clear defense of the corporation from the perspective of individual rights.	2001-02-28
US	53093154	R3TNH0AHCFP375	093855848X	765128294	Sweet Land of Liberty	Books	5	46	46	N	N	A splendid colonial history	*Sweet Land of Liberty* is a reprint of an 1881 young people's history of colonial America initially titled *Old Times in the Colonies*. It is an intermediary volume between Charles C. Coffin's *The Boys of '76*, the narrative of the battles of the American Revolution he published for the centennial, and his *Story of Liberty*, which chronicled &quot;the struggles of men in England and Europe against the tyranny of emperors, kings, popes, archbishops, bishops and inquisitors&quot;. It covers the whole period from Columbus's discovery of San Salvador in 1492 to the French and Indian Wars, with chapters on the establishment of the various colonies and the major events of the era.<br />This volume was reprinted by religious conservatives and will be of particular interest to homeschoolers. Coffin had a &quot;Providential view of history&quot;, believing that &quot;the settlement of America&quot; revealed  a &quot;design in Providence for the illumination of the ignorant, and the emancipation of the slavish part of mankind all over the earth.&quot; As a Frenchman, I view this hopeful vision of history with more than a little skepticism, as my own country shows no sign of sharing in any divine plans for liberty on earth. And I think Coffin himself would have been much more reserved if he had witnessed the evolution of his country in the century following the publication of his book.<br />But even for those who do not share the author's faith in Providence, which surfaces only occasionally, this colonial history will be a delight to read, accompanied as it is by hundreds of black-and-white illustrations artfully documenting the buildings, the landscapes, the costumes, the people and the events of the period. Together with Coffin's flair for the concretization and dramatization of history, these illustrations will &quot;take you there&quot; just as surely as any good work of historical fiction. The only technical flaw of the book is its maps, which never seem to be at the right place or to feature the locations you are looking for, and lack the often brilliant visual design of modern maps.<br />As far as the text is concerned, it tends to focus mostly on the issues of freedom of conscience and popular government. Though strongly inimical to the Catholics in general and the Jesuits in particular, it is not one-sided and often plays the devil's advocate. The presentation of quakerism, for instance, helped me understand why its devotees were often targeted as the victims of religious intolerance; and the chapter on the Salem Witch Hunt, by giving the whole American and European context of the episode, made it seem much less bizarre and unexplainable than it is generally made to be. Particularly interesting are the numerous accounts of Indian atrocities, which would never find their place in a modern, politically correct textbook. In their gory detail, however, they may make the book unsuitable for younger readers.<br />If you loved Edward Eggleston's beautiful *History of the United States and Its People* (recently reprinted by the Lost Classics Book Company), you will certainly enjoy this volume just as much. I also recommend it as a more concrete and anecdotal supplement to the first volume of Clarence Carson's *Basic History of the United States*. And as it ends with Robert Rogers' retaliatory attack on the St Francis Indians, it can also be read as a preface to Kenneth Roberts' excellent historical novel, *Northwest Passage*, which begins with the same incident.right place or to feature the locations you are looking for, and lack the often brilliant visual design of modern maps.<br />As far as the text is concerned, it tends to focus mostly on the issues of freedom of conscience and popular government.

US	53093154	RSEM3LC7TVFC3	0736633170	358793133	Edison:  Inventing The Century	Books	4	33	35	N	N	Interesting, but probably not *the* biography of Edison	&quot;The electric light is the light of the future- and it will be my light, unless some other fellow gets up a better one.&quot; - Thomas A. Edison<br />The author of lives of artist Man Ray and poet William Carlos Williams, Neil Baldwin chose to devote his third biography to a practical-minded genius: Thomas Alva Edison, one of America's most venerated icons. Beginning with the history of Edison's ancestors in the new world, this thick, 500-page volume has its subject come to life on page 17, and chronicles his prodigious accomplishments until his death in 1931, with numerous highlights on his two wives (the first of whom, Mary Stilwell, died at 29), children and in-laws.<br />The tone of the book is generally sympathetic, though Baldwin deliberately attempts to eschew the hero-worshiping of some earlier works in order to achieve a more &quot;balanced&quot; and sober view of the man. A lot of stress is laid on the consequences of Edison's incredible working habits on his family life and the emotional development of his children, and one cannot help thinking that the author blames him for his single-minded devotion to the pursuit of technological progress. Indeed, the metaphors used to describe Edison's industriousness and concentration are often borrowed from the vocabulary of pathology: he is presented as a &quot;workaholic&quot; rather than a hard worker, with &quot;obsessions&quot; rather than ambitions or passions. Even the division of labour in Edison's West Orange research center, says Baldwin, &quot;physically epitomizes the schisms in Edison's psyche&quot;.<br />The book is not overladen with technical minutiae, as the author seems to be more attracted to period detail than to hardware. His understanding of the science underlying Edison's experiments and theorizing did not strike me as particularly deep, anyway. Quoting Edison's speculations about the origin of the solar system, for instance, Baldwin exclaims that he was &quot;tantalizingly close to the fringe of a Big Bang theory&quot;. Of course, one should not demand too much from a PhD in Modern American Poetry.<br />The author's political philosophy is not too intrusive, but it annoyingly crops up at some points. For instance, he says that the great industrialists of the late nineteenth century might as well be called robber barons, &quot;depending on which side of the dialectic is preferred&quot;. His presentation of Edward Bellamy's utopian novel, *Looking Backwards*, as part of his attempt to convey the intellectual flavour of the age, is extremely positive: Bellamy's society is described as &quot;a place of abolished inequities and cultural efficiency, not wasteful production and underconsumption&quot; where &quot;the venerated 'unremitting toil' so characteristic of the competitive, unorganized and antagonistic 1880s would be supplanted by a commitment to equal sharing of the nation's wealth&quot;. This is more than slightly disturbing, considering that what Bellamy had drawn was a communist blueprint for America (see for instance Clarence Carson's *Flight from Reality* for an interesting analysis.)<br />But whatever the author's biases, they are completely overshadowed by the brilliance of his subject. Edison is simply a delight to read about, forcing admiration from his early childhood exploits to his discovery of an indigenous source of rubber in his seventies. <br />Everybody should read at least one biography of Edison, to acquaint himself with the possibilities open to man. Having only read this one, I cannot say whether it is the best choice. Edwin Locke, the author of *The Wealth Creators*, seems to favour Matthew Josephson's *Edison: A Biography* (1959), which is apparently less ambivalent in its admiration for its subject. As for the ABC-Clio CD-Rom on *American Business Leaders*, it also lists Ronald William Clark's *Edison: The Man Who Made the Future* (1977); Robert D. Friedel's *Edison's Electric Light: Biography of an Invention* (1986); RayPhillips's *Edison's Kinetoscope and Its Films: A History to 1896* (1997) and Wyn Wachhorst's *Thomas Alva Edison, An American Myth* (1981).<br />Edison has been an inspiration to many, including the greatest of all businessmen, his friend and admirer Henry Ford. But perhaps the most significant tribute that was ever paid to him, and the best characterization of his personality, was Ayn Rand's. In a letter to Tom Girdler dated 1943, she wrote: &quot;No humanitarian ever has [equalled n]or can equal the benefits men received from a Thomas Edison or a Henry Ford. But the creator is not concerned with these benefits; they are secondary consequences. He considers his work, not love or service of others, as his primary goal in life. Thomas Edison was not concerned with the poor people in the slums who would get electric light. He was concerned with the light.&quot;	2001-02-13

Carson was known as the author of several volumes on American intellectual, political and economic history, including *The Fateful Turn*, which chronicled America's abandonment  of individualism in favour of collectivism in the years 1880-1960 and *The War on the Poor*, an examination of the disastrous effects of government programs to &quot;help the poor&quot;.<br />But Carson felt that a much longer work was needed to fulfil his intellectual mission: a complete history of the United States that would correct the errors and distorsions of those available on the market. For Carson was very dissatisfied with the existing histories of the U.S.. As he wrote in The Review of the News in December 1982:  &quot;For years I have cursed the darkness, so to speak, as I have examined and reviewed history book after history book. On rare occasions, I would examine one with rising expectations as I made my way through the early part of the text... But, from the Civil War onward, even the best of them tend to go downhill into the miasma of leaden accounts of industrialization, mass production, the class struggle, the magnification of the alleged injustices of the American system, until by the time they reach the New Deal, they read as if they were written by press agents of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Indeed, some have been&quot;.<br />What he wanted was to avoid the biases of &quot;Marxists, socialists, anti-Americans, skeptics, humanists, and many, many others with axes to grind&quot;, by committing himself to telling &quot;as faithful an account as I could make it of what had actually taken place.&quot;<br />This effort was to have been published by a private foundation, Western Goals, whose purpose was &quot;to build and strengthen the political, economic and social structure of the United States and Western Civilization so as to make any merger with totalitarians impossible&quot;. But Carson's supporter in the foundation,U.S. Congressman Larry Mc Donald, was killed before the first volume had even been published: in an ironic twist of history, he died on board the Korean airliner that was shot down by the Soviets in 1983, along with 268 other innocent civilians.<br />Undaunted, Carson the academic turned into a businessman, creating the American Textbook Committee, and went on to publish the rest of his work independently, relying mostly on word of mouth and the eventual promotion of his writings by conservative or libertarian bookclubs.<br />The resulting history of the United States is definitely my favorite. While most modern historians assume that what the Founders created was a &quot;democracy&quot; which protected &quot;civil rights&quot;, and that their efforts were finally crowned by the establishment of the welfare state in the last century, Carson does understand that the United States are a constitutional federated republic based on the classical doctrine of individual rights.<br />For this reason, among many others, as Carson hoped it would, *Basic American History* succeeds in &quot;arousing anew that sense of mission and purpose which brought these United States into being&quot;.	2001-02-10

Flynn<br />In 1997, in that excellent newsletter of the Ludwig Von Mises Institute, *The Free Market*, one of my favorite historians, Robert Higgs, published a brilliant article entitled *No More &quot;Great Presidents&quot;*, in which he reviewed the results of a poll of thirty historians asked to rank America's presidents on a scale of &quot;failure&quot; to &quot;great&quot;. Among the select three who were thought to deserve the accolade &quot;great&quot; was Franklin Delano Roosevelt.<br />And this is not merely the consensus of the liberal historians in academia, who, as Higgs remarked, &quot;worship political power, and idolize those who wield it most lavishly in the service of left-liberal causes&quot;. As John T. Flynn explains, Americans generally tend to see FDR as a &quot;noble, gentle, selfless, hard-headed, wise and farseeing combination of philosopher, philanthropist and warrior&quot; who &quot;performed some amazing feat of regeneration for this country&quot;. They perceive him as the providential knight in shining armour who saved America from that evil spawn of unbridled capitalism, the Great Depression, and the world itself from that dark and alien evil from Europe, nazism.<br />I for one never fell for the Roosevelt myth. By the time I knew what he did, I had enough moral, political and economic common sense not to feel the slightest admiration for him. To be frank, I have always considered him the worst American president ever. So when I started Flynn's *The Roosevelt Myth*, I did not expect to have any illusions of mine destroyed.<br />The book did change my perception of Roosevelt though. I had always assumed he had been some evil genius who destroyed the Constitutional basis of freedom inAmerica in a conscious, calculating and utterly insidious way. I saw him as some malignant mastermind who had thoroughly bluffed a gullible American citizenry and robbed them of liberties which they were too unintellectual (or, alternatively, too intellectually corrupt) really to understand and cherish. In other words, I perceived Roosevelt as an Ellsworth Toohey, when he was closer to a James Taggart.<br />True, Roosevelt was a power luster. As Flynn explains, he was a pure politician, if you define politics as the art of winning votes. But this is all he was. In this lay all his intelligence. In all other matters, except perhaps maritime history, he was just a snobbish dilettante, completely unread and devoid of curiosity.  His knowlege of economics and political science was &quot;a total blank&quot;. He was nothing but a small, shallow man whose naïveté, ignorance, overconfidence in his own charm and complete lack of principles made him a mere puppet in the hands of the reds and pinks who swarmed in his office or interacted with him on the international scene.<br />That he was corrupt to the bone, there is no doubt: he was corrupt to a degree I thought had only characterized the White House since the Kennedy administration. But he was politically evil only by default, because of his ineffectiveness, his blindness, his vanity, his fatuousness, his lust for power and public adulation. All the evil I saw in him while studying his speeches did not originate in him, for they were all ghostwritten: he was only lending his &quot;golden voice&quot; to the string pullers in his administration, the actual &quot;thinkers&quot; of the New Deal, the genuine Tooheys.<br />*The Roosevelt Myth* is not a well-structured book. It is not chronological, it does tend to repeat itself, and it may be a bit confusing for someone who is not familiar with the broad outlines of the New Deal to begin with, as it is very detailed and swarms with minor figures. But it is an important book,the work of a first-rate journalist who examined tons of material on the President and his accomplices, some of whom he personally interviewed, and reached his conclusion based on a thorough, uncompromising examination of the record.<br />Prefaced by Ralph Raico, published by that generally excellent editor, Fox &amp; Wilkes, *The Roosevelt Myth* has been corroborated by independent scholars (Raico mentions Robert Nisbet's *Roosevelt and Stalin: The Failed Courtship* as further reading) and is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding this watershed era and the man who best symbolizes it.	2001-02-10

(I would like to seize the opportunity publicly to apologize to Scooby Doo for my misspelling of his name in my earlier review of the latter book.)<br />Despite the presence of the two aforementioned characters, I found this volume less appealing than the first, in part because of the style, which resorts too frequently to incomplete sentences, and in part because of the supernatural elements, which somewhat undermine the didactic purpose of the series (all the more so as the historical note does not actually refute the legend of the curse of King Tutankhamun's tomb, ambiguously stating that &quot;of course, respectable scientific opinion has dismissed this idea as nonsense&quot;.) I welcome the supernatural in the Indiana Jones movies, for their aim is to entertain, but the Young Indiana Jones adventures are supposed to have an educational vocation and therefore should stick more closely to reality.<br />My main disappointment with the book, however, was that it is not continuous with the TV series, and seems to have been written without any foreknowledge of its story arc. This trip to Egypt is presented as Indy's first, when the TV series has him meet Howard Carter in May 1908, during his excavations in the Valley of the Kings. Fortunately, as the series progressed, the authors added references to the *Chronicles*- such as the inclusion of Miss Seymour in *The Titanic Adventure*.	2001-01-30
US	53093154	R1VP76OTCR71BE	0892724676	767676490	Captain Caution	Books	3	31	36	N	N	A good old-fashioned serial, but not Roberts' best	At slighly more than 200 pages, *Captain Caution* may be Roberts' shortest novel after *Boon Island*. Its historical context- privateering during the War of 1812- makes it very similar to *The Lively Lady*, which I consider a superior novel for its handling of the love story and its potent evocation of Dartmoor Prison. However, a more discriminating reader will probably admit, with Booth Tarkington (Roberts's closest friend) that it is &quot;about an entirely different sort of privateering, and about a phase of war imprisonment wholly unlike the sorry interlude of Dartmoor.&quot;<br />The plot is rather simple: returning from Canton and unaware that war has started between America and Britain, the merchant barque *Olive Branch* from Maine is captured by a British ship and its crew sent to Europe. Among them is the hero, Daniel Marvin, a.k.a. Captain Caution, and the Captain's daughter, strong-minded but easily blinded Corunna Dorman, whose budding attraction to Daniel appears to be crushed by her holding him responsible for her father's death during the capture. As always in Roberts' novels, the two lovers are separated by external forces and the book is basically a story of the hero's undaunted efforts to regain his dulcinea.<br />*Captain Caution* was a tough sell for Kenneth Roberts, and for the right reasons, I think. Carl Brandt (who must have been Roberts' agent) said that &quot;the absence of the heroine for such a long period... would make monthly magazines reluctant to use it.&quot; And reluctant they were. As Roberts noted in his diary on October 25, 1932, &quot;*Captain Caution* has now been to every slick magazine in the United States, and has been unhesitatingly rejected by all of them&quot;. Even the editor of *Adventure*, a magazine which Roberts said did not &quot;pay much&quot; and was therefore a &quot;last resort&quot;, commented that &quot;slackening of interest in the principal characters had killed all possibility of making *Captain Caution* into a serial&quot;.<br />Indeed, the main characters are much less endearing than Roberts' other creations. Daniel Marvin is first shown as a rather powerless victim and only begins to show the resourcefulness and endurance of the typical Robertsian hero much later into the book. As he puts it himself, &quot;I've always looked for easier ways to do things, and almost always there's an easier way. It appears to me most people make things as hard for themselves as they can.&quot; His inventiveness, in the course of the novel, leads him to come up with modern boxing, the gangway pendulum and a winning formula for roulette (in whose efficacy Roberts, who was later completely duped by dowsing, may well have believed.)<br />For all this deluge of creativity, however, Roberts fails to give Marvin the enduring personality traits of the other fictional natives of Arundel he so lovingly protrayed. As for the love interest, Corunna Dorman, she is so deluded about both the hero and the scheming villain, Slade the slaver, and is so consistently wrong and angry, that her redemption falls rather flat.<br />In fact, I really thought that she would be another red herring, like Mary Mallinson in *Arundel*, while the much more lively niece of Talleyrand's would turn out to be the novel's Phoebe Nason (I consider the scenes between her and Marvin as really the most delightful of the whole work.) I found the combination of youthful naiveté and deep wisdom in her character really brilliant, and her advice to Marvin priceless: &quot;You are doomed to be an unhappy young man if you think that no woman is a good woman unless she has made no mistakes and had no desires, ever; and in case you wish that sort of good woman, you must be careful to marry a plaster saint out of a church.&quot;<br />It does seem as though Roberts was more inspired by his minor characters than by his protagonists this time: Lucien Argandeau, the bragging, loquacious French privateer and ladies' man, ranks among Roberts' best drawn supporting characters, up there with Cap' Huff and King Dick.<br />*Captain Caution* also lacks the historical texture of Roberts' longer pieces of fiction, and feels more like a Patrick O'Brian novel, focusing on plot and dialogue rather than on immersing the reader in the period by richly detailed descriptions (indeed, O'Brian may have been inspired by this novel: at one point, Marvin escapes capture by pretending he has cholera aboard, a trick which Maturin uses in *Master and Commander* with the same effect.) In other words, if you want painlessly to absorb the equivalent of a dozen historical volumes, you would be better off with *Lydia Bailey* or *Rabble in Arms*.<br />This said, *Captain Caution* is a rather enjoyable book, though definitely of a lighter sort than the rest of Roberts' fiction.	2001-01-30

The description of the battle which was published as the fourth volume of the *Kenneth Roberts Reader of the American Revolution* was his last piece of historical writing. It was published in an abridged version by *Collier's*, and reprinted in 1976 as a booklet by Herbert Faulkner West. West also included a five-page extract from a piece written by Roberts in 1936 and originally published in *Modern Book Collecting for the Impecunious Amateur*, describing Roberts' method of historical research and setting forth his belief that historical novelists, by the nature of their art, are often much more careful with their historical sources than professional historians.<br />*The Battle of Cowpens* itself, an eighty-page essay, starts by describing the general context of the battle, with Clinton first occupying Charleston then leaving Cornwallis in charge of South Carolina, and Cornwallis disobeying Clinton's orders by deciding to strike at Virginia, resulting in the defeat of Horatio Gates at Camden, South Carolina. (Those who have read *Rabble in Arms* know Roberts' opinion of Gates, which he reiterates here.) The two protagonists of the Battle of Cowpens are then presented: Daniel Morgan, the leader of the American troops, whom Roberts compares to his hero of the Northern Army, Benedict Arnold; and Banastre Tarleton, &quot;an incomparable cavalry leader&quot;, who later became a member of Parliament and died in 1833, aged seventy-eight (contrary to the fictional character of William Tavington in Gibson's *The Patriot*, who was loosely based on him.)<br />The battle itself is described in detail, sometimes polemically or in a dramatized way, with extracts from Nathanael Greene's orders to Morgan, and from Morgan's and Tarleton's own accounts of Cowpens (the latter wrote a *History of the Campaigns of 1780 and 1781 in the Southern Provinces of North America*, which Roberts used as a source.) Strategic and tactical maps are included at the end, together with a profile of the Cowpens, as relief played an important part in Morgan's battle plans.<br />The booklet is just as gripping as an episode from the British TV series *In the Line of Fire*, with Roberts' evocative style doing the work of the computer graphics. It is definitely a good place to start for those who have seen Mel Gibson's *The Patriot* and wish to know what really happened at the battle that inspired its climactic action sequence.	2001-01-24

As the actors matured, I supposed Lucas intended to have them explore the early 1910s and 20s. Unfortunately, the series petered out, and all we are left with is a collection of fifteen young adults books that fill the gap between the Carrier and Flannery periods, from the Spring of 1913 in this volume to December 1914 in *The Eye of the Tiger*.<br />*Young Indiana Jones and the Plantation Treasure* has thirteen-year old Indy join young Lizzie Ravenall (who returns in *The Curse of the Ruby Cross* and *Mountain of Fire*) in her quest for an ancient family treasure that has them trace a slave of her grandfather's through the remains of the Underground Railroad. The plot is pre-formatted Scoobidoo but, faithful to the vocation of the TV series, it manages to marble in some information on the antebellum South. Moreover, the slim volume contains five bibliographical references for kids who want to find out more, and a four-paragraph historical note which tells you that, contrary to the TV episodes, which always featured at least one important historical figure, &quot;the main characters in the book are all made up&quot;, but that abolitionist Garrick Lloyd was based on William Lloyd Garrison and the slave Indy and Lizzie are looking for, Harriet Stoneman, had a real-life equivalent, Harriet Tubman.<br />All in all, it is a rather sympathetic adventure that might conceivably stimulate interest in history among younger readers.<br />(One continuity error I am having problemswith is the allusion to the hat &quot;that man gave me in Utah&quot;, a reference to the Utah, 1912 segment of *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade*, in which an eighteen-year old River Phoenix played a thirteen-year old Indy. It is really hard to picture the hero of this book as Phoenix one year older. But then the fault lies with the movie, not the book.)	2001-01-24
US	53093154	R13NQJZL8386S3	0393307050	680723399	Master and Commander	Books	3	4	7	N	N	This first volume did not captivate me, but I'm no expert	Colin Wilson once wrote that &quot;the will feeds on immense vistas; without them, it collapses.&quot; And immense vistas is one of the main elements I look for in novels. Historical fiction being my favorite genre, I asked fellow fans to direct me to the work they considered to have the greatest historical and geographical scope. The *Flashman Papers* cropped up, but I was particularly seduced by the reference to Patrick O'Brian's twenty-volume Aubrey / Maturin series, which, I was told, not only covered all of the planet's seas and oceans, but touched upon an enormous variety of topics, including music, medicine and zoology. This was enough to make me purchase the first three volumes, plus the accompanying atlas and dictionary.<br />*Master and Commander* opens in 1800 with the first meeting of the series' two protagonists: Jack Aubrey, a minor officer in the Royal Navy, and Stephen Maturin, an impoverished doctor. Their initial impression of each other is one of mutual dislike, but as Aubrey gets promoted, he becomes a much more sociable fellow and convinces Maturin to become his ship's surgeon aboard H.M.S. Sophie, &quot;almost the only quarterdeck brig in the service&quot;. There follows a cruise on the Mediterranean in which Aubrey convoys merchant ships, makes captures, storms a fort and engages in various battles against enemy ships.<br />As an amateur screenwriter, I love plot and drama, but I found virtually none in this first volume of the series. *Master and Commander* is episodic at best: it has no theme to speak of, and therefore feels like a loosely integrated tale (O'Brian's own term for his novels), randomly moving from one sea encounter to the next. One of the rare threads running through the book is Maturin's attempt to make Aubrey and his Papist Lieutenant James Dillon recognize each other's value, but the effort peters out, Dillon dies and the thread is not resolved. The same goes with Aubrey's affair with the wife of a superior officer, the effects of which on Aubrey's career are of no great  importance.<br />The book's lack of direction partly comes from the characters themselves. Aubrey, a tactical genius at sea, a decent musician and a complete fool in all other matters, is a naïve, awkward and often ridiculous character whose sole ambition is to take part in heroic naval actions and be promoted for it. But he doesn't have any strong motivation or value that might dynamize the novel, even though I rather enjoyed his joie de vivre, his pride in his own prowess and his refreshingly childish enthusiasms. Maturin is a well-read Englightenment physician and naturalist, but he seems happy merely to go along, spotting the occasional rare animal or plant. Even their friendship felt rather shallow to me, although of course twenty volumes should leave it ample time to develop. For the moment, though, both Aubrey and Maturin seemed to remain in their own worlds, with Aubrey not being able to see very far into Maturin, and the latter generally seeing past the former.<br />Another feature of the book I found regrettable is that all its wisdom is incidental to the unfolding of the events, being relegated to often rambling dinner conversations and monologues. This, however, seems to be common in the type of fiction that is generally recognized as literature nowadays.<br />Finally, O'Brian is not interested in scenery, which I found disappointing as part of my interest in the series was touristic. He does not really attempt to make you see the places he takes his characters to, like Port Mahon, Malta or, even more blatantly, Alexandria. Roughly speaking, the book can be divided into two types of scenes: naturalistic dialogues overflowing with vocabulary, foreign language and cultural references, and action scenes, described in extremely technical naval jargon.<br />As for the style of the book, even though I deplored as always the occasional use of fragments (i.e. incomplete sentences), I was relieved to find it lessmodernist than O'Brian's friendship to Picasso might have presaged. <br />To be frank, I was rather impatient to be finished with the book and move on to something else, though I do intend to give Aubrey and Maturin another chance some day. However, I doubt I will ever enjoy O'Brian as much as I do Kenneth Roberts, who tackled the genre with such novels as *Rabble in Arms*, *The Lively Lady* and *Lydia Bailey*, or A. A. Attanasio, who tried his hand at high-seas adventures with *Wyvern*.<br />(If you intend to read this series, I strongly suggest you purchase Dean King's *A Sea of Words*, which elucidates most of the jargon and cultural references. I found the same author's atlas to the complete novels, *Harbors and High Seas*, a little less necessary but nevertheless very handy, as *Master and Commander* does not include any maps.)	2001-01-19
US	53093154	R3P6DAWDAW0C7Q	0870004565	699928853	The world in the grip of an idea	Books	4	6	6	N	N	An extraordinary work marred by its eighth book	&quot;They talk of planning economies, of controlling business, of controlling prices and wages... But they are always using power upon and controlling people, and not just some of the people either, but all of them.&quot; - Clarence B. Carson<br />According to historian Clarence Carson, the 20th century was characterized by one major phenomenon: it saw the whole world fall under the sway of a single idea, which Carson refers to as &quot;collectivism&quot; or &quot;socialism&quot;, though it often borrows other names.<br />Whatever its form, this idea fundamentally proposes &quot;to achieve human felicity on this earth by concerting all efforts toward its realization&quot;, which requires that we &quot;root out, discredit, and discard all aspects of culture which cannot otherwise be altered to divest them of any role of inducing or supporting the individual's pursuit of his own self-interest&quot;. And because men are not naturally inclined to sacrifice themselves to the alleged &quot;good of the whole&quot;, force must be introduced into the equation: the instrument to be used to perform these twin goals cannot be other than government.<br />This idea has two major variants, the revolutionary and the evolutionary. The former is what we call communism, as theorized by Marx and Engels and put into practice on the Russians, Chinese and countless other victims. The latter Carson calls &quot;gradualism&quot;, though it has also been called &quot;Fabianism&quot;, &quot;progressivism&quot;, &quot;liberalism&quot;, &quot;democratic socialism&quot; or, most disingenuously, &quot;democracy&quot;.<br />In this book, which according to him is less about the idea than its grip, i.e. its spread and implementation, Carson analyzes first revolutionary socialism (with the bolshevization or Russia and the nazification of Germany), then evolutionary socialism (from its genesis in England to its power grab in Sweden and the United States) and their clash known as the Cold War.<br />After WWII, Carson explains, the two variants of socialism split the world into two blocks: communism dominated the block centered in Moscow, and gradualism, the block centered in Washington. It is these two ideologies, and not communism and &quot;capitalism&quot; or &quot;democracy&quot; that were embroiled in the Cold War.<br />This revisionist analysis of the Cold War (in Book VII) is all the more brilliant as the old theory of a conflict between &quot;capitalism&quot; and communism has been replaced in some circles by a much more perfidious interpretation: &quot;revisionist historians... declared that the conflict was all a product of American hysteria, that communism had not so much fomented it as been victimized by it. Communism, in this view, was a bugaboo invented by Americans so far as its aggressiveness and threat to world peace was concerned.&quot; (p375)<br />On the contrary, Carson says, the West did fight against an expansionist, bellicose and tyrannical ideology. It is the nature of what it was fighting *for* that has been misconstrued: the so-called &quot;free world&quot; was in fact on the evolutionary road to socialism. In other words, the two blocks did not differ in their ultimate ideals or goals, but in their tactics, which explains the self-restraint of the alleged opponents of communism.<br />*The World in the Grip of an Idea* is the work of a man who, like Ayn Rand, is able to recognize the fundamentals of various belief systems and is therefore fooled neither by the kind of classification by non-essentials that identifies nazism as &quot;right-wing&quot;, nor by the orgy of renaming that would have us believe that some variant of socialism is actually not socialism but, say, American pragmatism. His analysis is so penetrating that the reader is finally able to make sense of that politically infamous century, the twentieth.<br />Unfortunately, in Book VIII, Carson, in an attempt to rescue the individual from its modern enemies, proceeds to launch an attack against what I would consider to be bugbears: &quot;machines&quot;, &quot;numbers&quot; and &quot;the corporation&quot;. Even though I always perceived him as a defender of nineteenth century liberalism, he calls the latter &quot;that pallid offspring of the French Revolution which has done already what it could do.&quot; Even though I have always seen him praise the free economy, he now claims that the world must not return to &quot;laissez faire capitalism&quot;, which he claims &quot;was a theory for leaving the capitalist free to do what he pleased, and leaving the rest of us free to do what *he* pleased.&quot; Turning into a Naderite, he even demonizes advertising, which he says is used &quot;to persuade the consumer that what the machines produce is what he wants&quot;...<br />In this unfortunate Book VIII, Carson seems to have fallen prey to a mixture of paranoia and package dealing, seeing ominous implications in the addition of a zero to his insurance policy number, and assimilating control by force to control by wages, thereby turning &quot;control&quot; into an anti-concept (for a refutation, see Ayn Rand's review of Skinner's *Beyond Freedom and Dignity* entitled &quot;The Stimulus... And the Response.&quot;)<br />Carson's attack on the corporation seems to be based mostly on leftist misrepresentations and sheer naïvete. He sees the emergence of the factory system as &quot;a retrogressive development&quot; and goes so far as to claim that &quot;the organization of workers is inessential to production&quot;! I think any sound economist or business historian could easily demolish this statement. (See for instance Reisman's *Capitalism*, Chapter 11, Part B on &quot;The Productive Role of Businessmen and Capitalists&quot;.) Carson also claims that &quot;organization&quot; in itself is evil, a destroyer of initiative, responsibility and ability, because he mistakenly assumes that &quot;organization&quot; means &quot;control from the top downward&quot; which &quot;insures that what will be accomplished will be restricted largely to what can be determined and directed from above.&quot; He does not seem to understand that &quot;organization&quot; is the division of labour applied to the company. And since 1776, we all know how essential division of labout is to wealth creation.<br />I did learn a lot from this book, as from all of Carson's other works, and I highly recommend it to anyone who can get a copy of it. However, the book also taught me that I was not a &quot;Carsonian&quot;, but an incurable Randian.	2001-01-06
US	53093154	R3HX7DN67IR01L	9997558472	955084979	Trending into Maine	Books	3	11	12	N	N	Enjoyable, but definitely one of Roberts' lesser works	Historical novelist Kenneth Roberts was a proud State-of-Mainer who found most of his inspiration in the exploits and quirks of his Maine ancestors. In late 1935, he was asked by Little, Brown and Co. &quot;to write a book on Maine&quot;, and his diary records that on February 24, 1937, he &quot;assembled material..., wrote the opening paragraph, and settled on a title.&quot;<br />The resulting effort, *Trending into Maine*, is an idosyncratic collection of articles and documents, most of them of a highly anecdotal nature, ranging from vignettes of early Maine colonists to a philippic against the defacement of the state by billboards in the 1930s.<br />At least half of the material in the book is not in Roberts' own hand, but consists in miscellaneous source documents, from letters of a sea captain's wife in the 1840s to eyewitness accounts of Maine exploits during the Civil War, all of them carefully edited and introduced by Roberts. Some of the figures portrayed in the book actually served as inspiration for characters in Roberts' novels, such as Mary Storer (the basis for *Arundel*'s Mary Mallinson), Mary Littlefield (the source for Phoebe Marvin) or Stephen Harding, who became Steven Nason in *Arundel* and *Rabble in Arms*.<br />Perhaps the most interesting piece for fans of Roberts' historical fiction is the chapter entitled &quot;Road to the Past&quot;, a digest of the author's *March to Quebec*, in which, as an outgrowth of his research for *Arundel*, he had gathered all the extant journals of members of Arnold's 1775 expedition. If you ever contemplated retracing Arnold's footsteps, you should find all the information you need in this mini-travel guide.<br />The book also contains a chapter on Maine food and recipes, and evocations of two of Roberts' favorite hobbies, hunting and fishing, complete with a six-page list of the best fishing spots in the state- though some of the fish may have moved or died since 1938.<br />On a more serious note, *Trending intoMaine* gives a few inklings of Roberts' political philosophy. From *I Wanted to Write*, I already knew him to be a staunch anti-communist and an opponent of the welfare state. Given his rather unphilosophical and concrete-bound character, I was curious to know what these political inclinations stemmed from, and in the chapter on &quot;Seamen and Sea Serpents&quot;, I found the answer.<br />Roberts simply absorbed the popular wisdom contained in such maxims as &quot;You cannot have your cake and eat it too&quot;, &quot;Diligence is the mother of good fortune&quot; or &quot;A penny saved is a penny earned&quot;. And he saw Roosevelt's New Deal policies as a complete inversion of the good sense and sound morals they encapsulate, replacing them with &quot;such warped maxims as... 'A government handout is better than a good name or riches'; 'Absence of competition is the life of trade'; 'You can eat your cake and have it too', 'Waste a lot in order to have business a lot'; 'Waste and laziness are the parents of good fortune'; 'What a man has, so much is he unsure of, and so much should he be made to disgorge by unsound laws'; 'Rome was created in a day by hasty and crack-brained legislation'; 'Leap first and look afterward' [the most concise summary of pragmatism ever]; 'Be sure you're wrong, then spend four billion dollars going ahead.'&quot;<br />For those of you seeking to document the ruinous blundering of the Roosevelt administration, there is an excellent chronicle of the W.P.A.'s botched-up Quoddy Village project, which Roberts describes as &quot;a relief measure that didn't relieve: a rehabilitation measure that didn't rehabilitate: a piece of New Deal planning set in motion by half-baked irresponsibles who had neglected to work out their plans.&quot; Roberts is at his most journalistic in this piece, and at his wittiest: commenting on the withdrawal of promised &quot;federal&quot; funds, he remarks: &quot;Perhaps the White House thought it ought to have a monopoly on spending money improperly&quot;.<br />Roberts was not a consistent libertarian, though. At certain points in the book, for instance, he advocates or supports regulatory measures aimed at preventing behaviour he disapproved of, such as zoning measures to keep loud vacationers away from Maine or laws banning  &quot;the killing of ducks, geese and all other waterfowl&quot;, simply because the poor birds are too easy targets, as against the resourceful Maine partridge.<br />*Trending Into Maine* is too eclectic and uneven to feature among Roberts' greatest works, but if you have already read and reread the latter, and are looking for insight into the man himself, you might definitely enjoy this collection, which the Boston Herald once described as &quot;an exhilaratingly lyrical book, with a warm glow over it, and a clean wind through it, and an unspoken challenge and invitation in it that sets a man's eyes gazing northward.&quot;	2000-12-27
US	53093154	R1KAFKXQZWAFKU	0385042167	510548905	I Wanted to Write	Books	4	12	15	N	N	The labours of a literary genius	My favorite authors of the twentieth century are Ayn Rand and Kenneth Roberts, and I have always been conscious of the similarities between them. Both started publishing huge, richly plotted, classically written novels in the 1930s. Both had an almost religious reverence for America, with Rand's being more abstract and systematic, and Roberts' stemming more from his sense of life. Both were fascinated by larger-than-life heroes: Rand's were literary creations, while Roberts' were recreations of such figures as Major Robert Rogers and Benedict Arnold. And both were self-taught geniuses in their own field (Rand in philosophy, Roberts in history) who heaped impatient, acerbic remarks on their professionally trained counterparts. Who could tell which of them wrote the following statement, for instance: &quot;Can't *any* American historian write anything but dull facts with all the essentials left out?&quot;. (Hint: it wasn't Rand.)<br />As I started reading *I Wanted to Write*, I was therefore curious whether I would discover more similarities between them, or whether those I had observed would prove to be isolated and purely superficial. The two areas I was most intrigued by were Roberts' politics and his literary likes and dislikes.<br />In politics, Roberts turned out to be just as fervent an anticommunist as Rand was, and just as early on. Of course, his personal experience with the communists in Siberia during WWI was much less extensive than Rand's prolonged endurance of them. But it was conclusive enough for him to say that &quot;Communism was an aristocracy of superboobs, determined to impose their own murderous and destructive beliefs on the whole world.&quot; He even wrote a play ironically entitled *The Brotherhood of Man* about the brutal murder of the imperial family by the bolsheviks.<br />Of course, I wasn't much surprised by this, Roberts being generally a man of good sense (though he did fall for dowsing in his later life.)  More unusual were Roberts' remarks about welfare statism.<br />There are several references to Franklin Roosevelt, one of the four horsemen of the welfare-state apocalypse in the U.S. (with JFK, Johnson and Clinton), and all of them are highly derogatory. Sent to the capital by the Post, Roberts described Roosevelt as &quot;amusing himself at the expense of the Washington correspondents, contemptuously ignoring their questions, or urging them to don dunce caps and stand in a corner.&quot; Roosevelt is also included in Roberts' list of &quot;prominent corner cutters who have botched foreign relations for the United States&quot;- &quot;corner cutters&quot; meaning compromisers, another type Rand abhorred. Roosevelt's 1920 statements on the League of Nations and communism were also characterized by Roberts as &quot;ludicrously incorrect&quot;.<br />More to the point, when Roberts was sent to England to write an article about &quot;Sir Oswald Moseley's British Union of Fascists&quot;, he found them &quot;annoyed at President Roosevelt because he had, they insisted, stolen Moseley's ideas for his New Deal without making acknowledgment&quot;.<br />Regarding Roosevelt's 1937 attack on the Supreme Court, Roberts had this to say: &quot;In the Paris Herald, read Mark Sullivan's account of Roosevelt's announcement that he proposed to retire all Supreme Court justices at seventy, and have a fifteen-man court which would make him a virtual dictator. It was the best character news story I ever read, describing the 'voluptuous pleasure' with which Roosevelt read his plans to the press, and the 'cruelty' of his attacks on the Old Men of the Supreme Court.&quot; (I must get a copy of this article!)<br />Finally, Roberts recounts that his wife read a book about a certain Italian island, Giglio, the residents of which &quot;were among the laziest people on earth because of the ease with which they obtained relief from the Dukes of Florence.&quot; Roberts' 1937 comment on this is most enlightening: &quot;Anybodywho thinks that history doesn't repeat itself needs only to watch what will happen to those who are going to get government relief for the next fifty years or so- or until intolerable taxes bring about another revolution in America.&quot;<br />As far as literature was concerned, Roberts was also strikingly similar to Rand. Hugo, who was to Rand's literary pantheon what Aristotle was to her philosophical one, is one of the few authors whose books Roberts read &quot;straight through&quot; on discovering them, together with such other Randian favorites as Kipling, Dumas and Sienkiewicz. Rand considered the latter's *Quo Vadis* as &quot;technically one of the best-constructed novels every written&quot; (*The Art of Fiction*), while the literary work which is mentioned most favourably by Roberts is Sienkiewicz's *Fire and Sword* trilogy. Rand also admired *Gone With the Wind* as &quot;an example of the skillful integration of plot to theme&quot; while Roberts said it was &quot;a bully book: one that well deserved to sell the 1,300,000 copies it's already sold.&quot;<br />Just as convergent is their opinion of fashionable naturalist authors. Roberts read a few of their novels, and concluded: &quot;They are all about sex and syphillis: all grimness and starkness: not a ray of humor or insight: two unclothed authors committing nuisances in a public park&quot;. He also favourably quoted Booth Tarkington's ironical description of Faulkner as &quot;satisfactorily confusing in ways that demonstrate greatness.&quot;<br />Such a remarkable convergence of literary opinion can only be explained by the sharing of esthetic standards. This is most clearly illustrated by Roberts' comments on a naturalistic film he once saw, which he described as &quot;a movie abortion... laid in a brothel, though supposedly depicting the cloak-and-suit trade- a story dirty, false, meaningless, plotless and without virtue&quot;: a scathing review which could have been extracted from Rand's journals.<br />There are many more parallels between the two authors. Roberts' excellent article on &quot;sophisticated girls&quot; echoes what Rand had to say about the second-handers, though Roberts always remained at a lower level of abstraction than Rand. But I don't want completely to spoil the pleasure of potential readers of *I Want to Write*. I just hope that if you admire Rand, this review will make you more than a little eager to discover Kenneth Roberts.who thinks that history doesn't repeat itself needs only to watch what will happen to those who are going to get government relief for the next fifty years or so- or until intolerable taxes bring about another revolution in America.&quot;<br />As far as literature was concerned, Roberts was also strikingly similar to Rand.

I made the same kind of peremptory judgement, based on just as unrepresentative a sampling of the genre, when I discovered King Hu's *Touch of Zen* about fifteen years ago and called Hu the best author of martial arts movies ever - and I have never felt the need to reconsider.<br />Made famous for his brilliant epics of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812, and his exalting evocation of the life of Major Robert Rodgers in *Northwest Passage*, Roberts was often asked for advice by aspiring writers and finally decided to answer them all by writing what might be called a professional autobiography, i.e. a portrait of Kenneth Roberts, the author, at work.<br />Rather than beginning with Roberts' childhood, *I Wanted to Write* opens with Roberts' birth as a writer (marked by a series of articles he contributed in 1904 to Cornell University's humorous magazine, *The Widow*), then chronicles a journalistic career that took him to Japan, Siberia, Europe and Washington, and finally recounts the painful gestation of the ten volumes of fiction and historical documents he wrote, edited or translated, with copious extracts from his diaries of the 1930s.<br />Because of the focus of the book, you will find very little about &quot;Roberts the man&quot;, insofar as he can be distinguished from &quot;Roberts the author&quot;. His wife Anna, for instance, appears as little more than an insubstantial figure, a secretary, a thrifty consort, and a generally unobtrusive and supportive presence. Much more significant are the two men who seem to havebeen Roberts' best friends and professional mentors: George Horace Lorimer of the Boston Post, an editorial genius whose biography by John Tebbel, Roberts says, &quot;should be an inspiration and a guiding star... to would-be writers&quot;; and Booth Tarkington, the fellow novelist who egged him on, advised him and shared so many nights with him reading and rereading Roberts' manuscripts.<br />*I Wanted to Write* is the professional testament of a man whose life was guided by two ideals: the love of truth, which made him swim against the tide and contradict the historians of his time (whom he generally considered as incompetents); and the love of his work done his way (to paraphrase Howard Roark, a fictional character with whom Roberts had much in common), which made him devote countless hours to researching, writing and rewriting his heavy volumes.<br />And it is precisely those two ideals, rather than technical recipes, which Roberts has to offer to those who would follow him on the path to literary greatness. For writing is not for idlers and, as he concludes with Thoreau, &quot;any truth is better than make-believe&quot;.	2000-12-23

The best in the series so far	Though a great admirer of Clarence Carson's works in general, I had found the first four volumes of his history of the United States slightly less interesting than more thematic essays like *The Fateful Turn* or *The Flight From Reality*. Maybe it is because Carson is more at home in pure intellectual history, or because I myself prefer concepts over facts and chronology.<br />However, Carson's *Basic History of the United States* remains in my opinion the most reliable on the market. As a professor of American history, it is the only one I personally recommend to my students, and the best of the six complete histories of the U.S. I have read so far.<br />The six-volume series is divided into the following periods: 1- The Colonial Experience 1607-1774; 2- The Beginning of the Republic 1775-1825; 3- The Sections and Civil War 1826-1877; 4- The Growth of America 1878-1928; 5- The Welfare State 1929-1985; 6- America in Gridlock 1985-1995.<br />The fifth volume itself is comprised of ten chapters: The Great Depression, The Thrust of the New Deal, Toward the Welfare State, The Coming of World War II, The United States in World War II, The Cold War, Welfarism at Home and Abroad, A Second Radical Reconstruction 1960-1975 and The Conservative Response.<br />To those of you who are sick of the deification of FDR and JFK and the vilification of Hoover and McCarthy, you will find a treatment of these key figures that radically departs from the established liberal gospel. Hoover's exceptional charity after World War I is brilliantly documented, and his refusal to enact welfare reforms on a large scale is attributed not to a lack of compassion but to the fact that &quot;as President of the United States, he was the head of the government, not theretofore thought of as a charitable organization&quot;.<br />Roosevelt, on the other hand, is presented as &quot;a candidate seeking votes, not losing them by presenting hard choices&quot;, who in his campaign speeches, dishonestly presented himself as an opponent of government expansion: &quot;I accuse the present [Hoover] Administration of being the greatest spending Administration in peace times in all our history. It is an Administration that has piled bureau on bureau, commission on commission... I regard the reduction of Federal spending as one of the most important issues of his campaign.&quot;<br />Carson goes on to show how the Constitution was brutally abused by the New Deal, approvingly quoting from H. L. Mencken's hilarious &quot;Constitution for the New Deal&quot; and concluding with a chapter on &quot;New Deal Hoopla and Harsh Reality&quot;.<br />Carson's characterizations of the major political figures of the era are masterpieces of concision and lucidity. Of Roosevelt's wife Eleanor, he says that &quot;she never shook off the settlement house mentality. As a President's wife for many years, she was inclined to view the whole United States as a social work project&quot;. As for Eisenhower, Carson says that although &quot;he referred to himself sometimes as being 'basically conservative'&quot; and &quot;favored a greater separation of powers than recent presidents had practiced&quot;, he soon abandoned all pretense to being an opponent of socialist legislation, as his administration &quot;shifted away not only from any foray toward dismantling the Welfare State but also from vigorously restraining it. Indeed, Eisenhower was detectably moving toward modest extensions if not expansions of welfarism.&quot;<br />Kennedy is shown as a &quot;somewhat inept, inexperienced and at best mediocre&quot; president who was turned into a national hero by Johnson's politically motivated exploitation of his televised martyrdom.<br />As for &quot;McCarthyism&quot;, instead of describing it as a paranoid and totalitarian witch-hunt, Carson shows how liberals managed to shift public indignation and fears from the very real threat of Communism to McCarthy's occasionally excessive methods, and have used what Ayn Rand called the pseudo-concept of McCarthyism as &quot;a convenient weapon to beat anyone over the head with who begins to gain an audience for charges against&quot; communists.<br />But the greatest treat in the book is Carson's chronicling of the intellectual and political rebirth of conservatism from the 1940s to the 1980s. Here you will find information on the pillars of modern conservatism, from Friedrich Hayek to Ludwig Von Mises, Ayn Rand, William F. Buckley, Russell Kirk, Leonard Read and others I had never heard of, and the various books and reviews in which they defended their ideas. Carson's treatment of Rand is unfortunately unfair and not very well informed. He presents her as an emigrant &quot;from Europe&quot;, for instance, instead of stressing her first-hand experience of Soviet tyranny. And like many critics, he fails to grasp the difference Objectivism makes between altruism and benevolence.<br />But such flaws as Carson's *Basic History of the United States* evinces are so minor in comparison with the massive distortions of liberal textbooks that this six-volume history stands high above any of its competitors.at Ayn Rand called the pseudo-concept of McCarthyism as &quot;a convenient weapon to beat anyone over the head with who begins to gain an audience for charges against&quot; communists.<br />But the greatest treat in the book is Carson's chronicling of the intellectual and political rebirth of conservatism from the 1940s to the 1980s.

US	53093154	R3FE8ZOLXCFJ4C	0310226554	938771460	Case For Christ - Journalist's Personal Investigation Of The Evidence For Jesus	Books	3	184	246	N	N	An exciting but unconclusive book	As its title indicates, this book defends the case *for* Christ and does not purport to be an impartial examination of the evidence. Lee Strobel had made his mind before he wrote the book, and this volume is a reconstruction, in the form of a series of interviews, of his own conversion, which took place over a two-year period of intensive reading after that of his wife.<br />Precisely because Strobel is now a Christian, the fourteen scholars he chose to interview are all devout Christians themselves; they are all presented in a favourable light as rational, well-informed and benevolent individuals; and they all assert that their study of the archeological and textual evidence for Christ has strengthened their faith in his divinity. Whatever counter-arguments are presented in the book seem to have been included merely to make the book more convincing, by showing that all the &quot;hard questions&quot; have been dealt with.<br />This said, the book is indeed a fascinating inquiry into what is perhaps the greatest historical mystery of all. Using his background as a journalist at the Chicago Tribune, Strobel opens each chapter with an account of a criminal case that illustrates the importance of a careful examination of the evidence. This of course is a rhetorical device intended to present Strobel himself as a hard-headed, no-nonsense inquirer. And even though it does help clarify some of the aspects of rational proof, it has the unfortunate effect of associating Christianity with rather grizzly news items.<br />Some of Strobel's points, I think, are irrefutable: Jesus did exist, his life is much better documented than that of any figure of the same era and he did not merely swoon on the cross, but actually died there.<br />However, I found some of the key arguments for his divinity, resurrection and miracles less than convincing. For instance, one of the scholars interviewed, J. P. Moreland, argues that the best circumstantial evidence for Jesus's resurrection is theconversion of &quot;an entire community of 10,000 Jews&quot; to Christianity within five weeks of his crucifixion. This is all the more striking, he says, as the Jews' extremely resilient beliefs and religious practices have survived over the millenia.<br />I find this argument deficient on at least two counts. First, the practice of baptism was not originated by Jesus, but by John the Baptist who apparently attracted large crowds (at least in the movies I've seen ;-) even though he did not perform any miracles and certainly was not resurrected. Second, to argue that just because the Jews *as a group* are very strongly attached to their beliefs, the defection of many *individual* Jews requires a miracle is to commit the fallacy of composition.<br />I also think that the number and dedication of a religious leader's followers are irrelevant to the factual or moral truth of his teachings. Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon Church, for instance, was a documented bum and quack whose fabrications are so ludicrous that they are not even worthy of scholarly refutation. And yet the Mormon Church counts about eight million members today.<br />I do recommend *The Case for Christ* though, both as a good counterbalance to the sometimes misinformed dismissiveness of many TV documentaries, and as probably the best place to start with on the subject. Though the occasional Creationist creeps in, Strobel's bibliographical recommendations at the end of each chapter seem to be generally excellent. I have for instance begun reading Craig Blomberg's *The Historical Reliability of the Gospels*, and it is a work of a much higher caliber then Strobel's, which even refutes some of the arguments Strobel considered as decisive. In the last paragraph of his introduction, for instance, Blomberg refutes C. S. Lewis's 'trilemma', with which Strobel chose to conclude his book.<br />And whatever the ultimate decisiveness of its arguments, *The Case for Christ* is an exciting book that shouldbe of interest to all those who love a good mystery.<br />(Another reference on the subject which was recently recommended to me by someone for whom I have the greatest respect is Nicholas T. Wright's series *Christian Origins And The Question Of God*, two volumes of which have been puslished so far: *The New Testament And The People Of God* and *Jesus And The Victory Of God*.)	2000-12-19

What this second part amounts to is a brilliant history of philosophy in 130 pages, with very powerful refutations of the most influent philosophical systems.<br />The last 170 pages or so are devoted to an attempt to learn as much as possible about what the uncaused cause is - or, more precisely, is not - and to determine whether the God of the Christians could be this uncaused cause. Based on Aquinas's theory of the &quot;four orders&quot; (physical, intentional, existential and cultural), this last part is essentially a work of Christian apologetics, dealing with such issues as the meaningfulness of the concept of the Trinity (which is shown not necessarily to involve a violation of the law of non-contradiction), the problem of evil or the compatibility of God's omniscience and omnipotence with human free will.<br />As an Objectivist, I found this book just as enlightening and challenging as all of the author's books I have read so far. Objectivism considers with Aristotle that the universe is eternal and requires no explanation outside of itself, and therefore treats it as an uncaused cause. The only discussion of the concept of God in the most authoritative presentation of the philosophy (Leonard Peikoff's *Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand*) occurs as an example in the chapter on &quot;The arbitrary as neither true nor false&quot;, and is therefore very dismissive.<br />One of the basic epistemological principles of Objectivism is that &quot;the onus of proof is on him who asserts a negative&quot;. Like many Objectivists, I was under the impression that so long as theists have not *proved* the existence of God, I need not concern myself with the question. However, as Grisez's treatment of the onus of proof principle made me realize, what theists need to do in order to shift the presumption is merely to make the existence of God *plausible* (otherwise, when would discussion ever take place?)<br />If *Beyond the New Theism* did not make a theist out ofme, it has convinced me that the God of Christianity does not &quot;contradict all the fundamentals of a rational philosophy&quot;, and has saved me from the misrepresentations of Christianity that flourish in Objectivist circles. Grisez does not say that &quot;the meaning of 'God' is beyond the power of language to specify&quot;, but treats his argument as a way of specifying it. He does not espouse altruism, but rejects it as a &quot;false ideal&quot; (p355). And he does not use the concept of God to belittle man, but argues with Aquinas that &quot;To detract from the perfection of creatures is to detract from the perfection of divine power.&quot;<br />I highly recommend this books to anybody who is more committed to the truth than to his own beliefs.	2000-12-02
US	53093154	R3HHZC6LRMH0LK	0786100990	11382629	Basic Economics (Library Edition)	Books	5	46	48	N	N	An excellent introduction to economics for historians	&quot;Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as paper money, any more than there is such a thing as a paper horse, paper potato ... paper man or any other commodity, except paper paper, which is clearly a redundancy.&quot; - Clarence B. Carson<br />The author of several &quot;basic&quot; volumes (*Basic History of the United States*, *Basic Communism* and *Basic American Government*), historian Clarence Carson steps out of his own discipline with *Basic Economics*, a well-structured introduction to economics that should be of particular interest to students of history.<br />Organized in three parts, this 390-page volume begins with something one rarely finds in an economic textbook: what Carson calls the &quot;framework of economics&quot;, or the metaphysical, ethical and political  preconditions for the existence of economic activity and economic science. One of these, contrary to what anarcho-capitalists claim, is government. Indeed, Carson explains, the functions of government, by their very nature, cannot be performed by private firms, mostly because they do not involve the provision of goods or services, but of products which according to him might better be called &quot;bads&quot;.<br />Part II is devoted to economics per se, i.e. the production and distribution of goods and services. Beginning with the concept of scarcity and a refutation of the fallacy of abundance, it examines the four ways of &quot;getting what we want&quot; (i.e. gifts, production, exchange and force), and then covers such fundamental issues as the origin and functions of money, the determination of prices on the free market, competition and monopoly, the three elements of production (land, labour and capital), entrepreneurship, the various sources of revenue and international trade.<br />Finally, Part III consists in an examination of the six major politico-economic systems: feudalism, mercantilism, free enterprise, capitalism, welfarism and communism. Contrary to Ludwig Von Mises andAyn Rand, as this classification suggests, Carson consistently refuses to use the term &quot;capitalism&quot; to denote the free economy, because this would suggest that the latter favors capital over the other factors of production, and that the opposite system, communism, is somehow &quot;anti-capital&quot;, which Carson demonstrates it is not.<br />The book also contains an appendix with a glossary of economic concepts, biographical sketches and an index.<br />Even though there are many excellent introductions to economics on the market (from Carl Menger's *Principles of Economics* to George Reisman's *The Government Against the Economy* or Henry Hazlitt's *Economics in One Lesson*), Carson's is the one I would recommend more specifically to students of history, who are prone to absorbing erroneous economic notions from the Keynesian or Marxist assumptions of history textbooks. Here, economics is laid flat, so to speak, so that its internal structure and its basic arguments can be examined rationally and explicitly, within the context of numerous historical examples, mostly borrowed from US history.<br />Some of the author's positions are invalid (he would probably have retracted his criticism of speculation if he had simply read Reisman on &quot;The Specific Productive Role of the Stock Market&quot;, pp466-7 of his magnum opus, *Capitalism*), and I am still uncertain about some of the issues he raises (such as fractional reserve banking and limited liability companies). However, I found much of interest in this book, and apart from George Reisman's aforementioned *Capitalism* (a massive volume which definitely requires much more time and effort), I cannot think of a single work on the subject I would recommend more enthusiastically to the uninitiated.	2000-11-26

Keeley<br />For Lawrence Keeley, the study of prehistory (a period which, for some peoples, ended only a few dozen years ago) has been torn between two paradigms: the Hobbesian and the Rousseauian. According to the former, primitives are warlike, and need the institution of the state to put an end to the nastiness and brutishness of their lives. According to the latter, civilization is the corrupter, subverting the harmony and peacefulness of primitive life with overpopulation, greed and the encouragement of exploitative behaviour.<br />For several decades, the Rousseauian myth has ruled academia, where swords have been &quot;beaten into metaphors&quot;: omnipresent fortifications are interpreted as expressions of &quot;the symbolism of exclusion&quot; and weapons as a form of money or status symbols, so that- to paraphrase Keeley- the obviously bellicose becomes the arcanely peaceable.<br />But what the civilization-bashers had not counted on was that their Big Lie would ultimately be exposed by objective scientists working on the basis of incontrovertible facts: the archeologists, whose patient, reality-oriented detective work completely refutes the fashionable whitewashing of primitive peoples.<br />What bones tell us is that wars were more common among the primitives than among modern nations, that proportionately more people were involved in them and died in them. Admittedly, those wars were waged on a smaller scale than modern man's, because primitive economies could neither support the large populations nor the impressive logistics that enable modern nations to sustain long-term and wide-ranging war efforts. But relative to their population figures, primitives are a much more violent breed than civilized men.<br />As always, of course, statistics tell only part of the story. Just as enlightening are the picture of the corpse of a U.S. cavalryman, horribly mutilated by the Cheyenne, or the simple description of what a Tahitian warrior would do to his vanquished enemy's corpse: crush it flat with his war club, then cut a slit through it and wear it as a poncho. (Horror is mitigated by irony when one considers that, in the 18th century, &quot;the explorer Louis de Bougainville reported that Tahitians exactly fulfilled Rousseau's predictions&quot;...)<br />*War Before Civilization* is an excellent illustration of what the application of logic to reality can do to dispel the myths woven by evaders and ideologically motivated revisionists, and so long as the author sticks to his own discipline, he shines as a beacon of perspicaciousness and objectivity. Outside of his own field, though, Keeley is less brilliant: his recommendations for the preservation of peace in our age (such as compromising with our enemies or letting foreign powers monopolize resources we could produce ourselves) are examples of fallacious induction; his choice of Hobbes as the antithesis of Rousseau creates an unsavory alternative between two proponents of absolute power (which is all the more regrettable as Locke would have served the author's purposes just as well); and his endorsement of the theory that &quot;real&quot; war is total war makes him mistake the moral constraints of civilized warfare for a lack of realism or even inefficiency. As for his analysis of the causes of the academic distortion of the prehistorical record, it would have benefited from a familiarity with Ayn Rand's Objectivism, and Gross and Levitt's debunking of the academic left in *Higher Superstition*.<br />If you are the kind of person who always feels compelled to put such words as &quot;civilized&quot; and &quot;primitive&quot; in quotes, Lawrence Keeley's book is the best therapy I can think of, along with Robert B. Edgerton's *Sick Societies* and Ayn Rand's *Return of the Primitive*.	2000-11-04

[They are] wrong.&quot; - Clarence B. Carson<br />Clarence Carson's *The American Tradition* is an attempt by the author to counteract the efforts made by modern intellectuals to innoculate American students against an understanding of their country's true essence. For the basic ideas of the Founding Fathers, Carson argues, &quot;did not just slip away because of defective memory&quot;, but as a result of the concerted efforts of modern liberals at &quot;undermining, distorting, obscuring and defaming the American tradition&quot;.<br />By &quot;tradition&quot; Carson means &quot;a body of beliefs, customs, habits, ways of doing things which are handed down from generation to generation&quot; (p22), originating in the convergence of popular practices, just as a trail in a forest is shaped by repeated use. This he contrasts with ideologies, which are exhaustive models of reality, originated by intellectuals and generally imposed by force on the rest of the population.<br />Using these two concepts, the author divides America's history into three stages: the colonial era, during which an authoritarian tradition prevailed; the late 18th and 19th centuries, which were characterized by the emergence and preservation of a tradition of freedom; and the late 19th and 20th centuries, during which collectivists ideologies systematically displaced the specifically American ideals, resulting in the statist onslaughts of the thirties and sixties, and the modern socio-democratic status quo.<br />&quot;Lest we forget&quot;, Carson attempts to salvage the original American tradition of freedom, discarding the anti-concept of &quot;democracy&quot; and the treacherous identification of Americanism with &quot;pragmatism&quot;, and reviving such crucial notions as the Higher Law; Republican government; federalism; individualism; political equality; individual rights; voluntarism; and internationalism - all of which together represent the core of the American tradition.<br />Even though I do not completely agree with the author's analysis (I think that he underestimates the role of intellectuals in shaping the classical liberal tradition, for instance; and I found his discussions on &quot;rights and responsibilities&quot; dangerously close to justifying conscription), I believe this book should be read by all Americans today, especially those who have not yet realized how far their country's founding principles have been betrayed by its intellectuals and political leaders for several generations. To quote Carson, what such people &quot;do not perceive is the illusory character of what is said to be preserved and the very real uses of power which have been introduced.&quot;<br />Virtually all the chapters abound in penetrating insights, but I particularly loved the last one, where Carson tries to identify the mistakes that were made by the Founders when drafting the Constitution, reminding me of the similar work being done by Judge Narragansett at the end of *Atlas Shrugged*. But while Ayn Rand's fictional character identified contradictions in the document and added at least one crucial clause, the flaws Carson points out are mostly errors in formulation, which left the Constitution open to subversion by misinterpretation.<br />The similarities between Carson's and Ayn Rand's views are striking, all the more so as Carson is a Protestant with a rather negative opinion of Rand as a philosopher. I wonder just how much influence she had on him. In his *Swimming Against the Tide*, his volume of &quot;Memoirs and Selected Writings&quot;, he expressed his opinion of Rand as a &quot;great artist&quot; and an able defender of the Free Market, but rejected both her atheism and her defense of rational egoism (which he misconstrued.) But whatever their differences in metaphysics and ethics, their analysesof political, economic and intellectual trends are extraordinarily convergent, making Carson's books a welcome addition to any Objectivist library.	2000-10-21

But a privileged few have been enjoying his movies for more than two decades, from the cheap, non-stop-kung-fu flicks he first starred in to his more recent and more expensive cop movies and period pieces.<br />*I Am Jackie Chan* is the story of the making of these movies and of the man who made them possible: a first-hand, first-person account of Jackie Chan's eventful life, from his training at a Peking Opera school, where we discover the overweight bully who was to become &quot;big brother&quot; Samo Hung, to his second and hugely successful attempt to conquer the American public.<br />The book unravels the rather bumpy ride to stardom of this atypical martial artist who always preferred being beaten up by the bad guys to the other way around, who repeatedly risked his life to perform the most incredible stunts ever filmed (Jackie stop! We don't want to lose you!) and whose happy-go-lucky persona finally eclipsed that of Bruce Lee himself.<br />I really loved this success-story, set in a world whose death warrant was signed in 1997 when the Communists took control of Hong Kong. Jackie has seen it all, from the Shaw Brothers to Golden Harvest; from the greatest of all Hong Kong directors, King Hu, to that smug, overbearing, cigar-smoking individual with a penchant for &quot;bathroom humor and clumsy slapstick&quot;- Lo Wei; from the evil Triads to the elitist clique of the movie stuntmen, who lived in the present because their future didn't even have a wire to hang on to.<br />If for you the names of Cheng Pei Pei, Michelle Yeoh (pre-Tomorrow Never Dies) and Yuen Woo Ping (pre-Matrix) have more magic to them than the equivalent Hollywood names, then you will enjoy this unique, exotic auto-biography, which really begs for a screen version in the vein of *Dragon: The Story of Bruce Lee*.<br />A good companion to this volume is the 75-minutevideo documentary entitled *Jackie Chan: My Own Story*, which shows rare footage from his films, bloopers and interviews with Jackie Chan, his closest associates and the American stars who count themselves his fans. At the end of this documentary, Chan says that he has fulfilled his three dreams of personal success, but that he now has a fourth one: world peace. I think we definitely ought to give him that. He deserves it.	2000-10-17

And even when he errs - as when his deeply held religious beliefs make him disparage man's creative abilities or when he reads a Platonic dualism in the Declaration of Independence - his errors have a way of remaining localized, leaving the flow of his arguments uncorrupted.<br />Just as importantly, he is able to give you the substance of past thinkers without any distortion or gross misrepresentation, refusing for instance to label the US form of government a &quot;democracy&quot; (&quot;the democratic features of the American political system are accidents... [Its] essence... is limited government&quot; pp257-8) and providing a clear and accurate knowledge of the original intent of the Founders that puts to shame the more in-depth and usually more myopic scholarly studies.<br />Published in 1973, *The Rebirth of Liberty: the American Republic 1760-1800* covers about the same ground as the first volume and part of the second volume of Carson's *Basic History of the United States*, or section II of his *Basic American Government*, though with a more chronological approach. It deals with the influence of the English heritage, the colonial experience and the Enlightenment on the political ideas of the Founders; chronicles the failures of Great Britain's mercantilism and the consequent acts of rebellion of the colonies, culminating in the winning of the War of Independence; and finally moves on to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the ratification debates and the adoption of the Bill of Rights, ending with two short chapters on the important political decisions made during the first few presidencies, and slightly overstepping the bounds of the subtitle with such court decisions as Marbury vs. Madison and Fletcher vs. Peck.<br />Though he is at his most penetrating when dealing with intellectual history and tends to prove less brilliant and original as soon as he stoops to the more factual levels, Carson delivers here an excellent account of the founding of the US government which provides the reader with the essential context for understanding the beliefs and intentions of its creators- an effort that is all the more laudable as those beliefs and intentions have been drowned in the liberal misinterpretations of the twentieth century.<br />The book is complemented by 60 pages of landmark documents, from the Declaration of the Stamp Act Congress to Jefferson's Inaugural Address.	2000-10-17

The divergence between the two universes  occurred when Jefferson chose to include *one* additional word in the  Declaration of Independence: &quot;government derives its just powers from  the *unanimous* consent of the governed&quot;. Why this divergence? Because  in the alternate universe, Jefferson &quot;chose to think&quot;, which he  apparently did not at this point in *our* universe. (Smith borrowed his  theory of free-will as the choice to think or not to think from Ayn Rand,  who by the way was president of the US in his parallel universe, though  prior to the action of the novel.)<br />The &quot;butterfly effect&quot; has  its fascination. But I personally doubt that Jefferson could have inserted  the word &quot;unanimous&quot; at this place (let alone have been out of  focus while writing *our* Declaration), since he was such a devoted reader  of Locke, and certainly recognized with him that unanimity is practically  impossible to reach in a representative government, where some form of  majority rule must take its place. Locke writes for instance in the *Second  Treatise on Civil Government* (Section 98) : &quot;nothing but the consent  of every individual can make any thing to be the act of the whole: but such  a consent is next to impossible ever to be had...&quot;<br />Perhaps more  importantly, I found it very unfair of Smith to package-deal Madison with  Hamilton as arch-enemies of freedom, just because Hamilton was the most  statist of the Founders and Madison collaborated with him on *The  Federalist*. Madison had a completely different psychology and political  philosophy than Hamilton, and he was undeniably one of the greatest  defenders of individual rights ever, perhaps even greater than Jefferson  himself. As for the idea that the Constitution was a statist document,  while the Articles of Confederation were more libertarian, it is a very  biased opinion: anarcho-capitalists simply like the Articles better because  they were much more decentralized and messy (and, come to think of it,  because they required unanimity of the member colonies, thus virtually  paralyzing legislation and approximating anarchy.)<br />Proselytizing for  anarcho-capitalism, Smith claims that in his alternate America, the  standard of living is about fifty times as high as in the real, statist  America; that people live about four times as long; and that there are only  a dozen violent deaths per decade due to the generalization of  gun-ownership, from kindergarten on. But it is easy to assert anything in  fiction. Much more telling as to what would happen in such a universe are  the documented differences between North and South as far as the use of  guns was concerned: the North accepted the English common law, which  considered duels criminal and encouraged each individual to back out of  conflictual situations rather than use guns (&quot;in any dispute  threatening violence, the threatened subject had a legal duty to retreat  from the scene if possible, and failure to do so was culpable, if homicide  followed&quot;, Paul Johnson, *History of the American People* p545); while  the South, on the other hand, had a very strong tradition of dueling. The  result, pace Smith, was much greater violence in the South.<br />Finally, I  neither liked the style nor the basic ideas of &quot;The Probability  Broach&quot;. The narrator being an anti-hero a la Mike Hammer, who likes  to parade his wit and his ability to generate &quot;colourful  metaphors&quot;, the novel tends to resemble a parody of detective fiction,  using a lot of street slang and very impressionistic descriptions.<br />To be  fair to Smith, though, I did like the first two Lando Calrissian  adventures. But then, that was years ago.	2000-08-25

In a 1975 article, she wrote that the &quot;anti-abortion stand&quot; was &quot;an indication of a fundamental evil in a person's convictions&quot; (*The Ayn Rand Letter*, November-December 1975.) Nineteen years later, in a very influential lecture on *The Right to Abortion*, a leading Objectivist, Andrew Bernstein, argued that a fetus, at whatever stage of its development, is just a part of the mother's body, and is consequently hers to do as she wishes. Abortion, therefore, according to Objectivism, should be legal up to the last minutes before birth.<br />According to James Campbell, however, this position is &quot;fundamentally antithetical to basic principles of Objectivism&quot;.  He accuses both Ayn Rand and Andrew Bernstein of concrete-bound thinking, the stolen-concept fallacy and what he calls the &quot;fallacy of the reification of the One&quot;. By the latter, he means &quot;the practice of valuing a particular attribute of a thing to the exclusion of its other attributes&quot;- which, in this case, leads to reducing man to one of his attributes, rationality, to the exclusion of all others. (Had Campbell listened to the Q&amp;A period of Bernstein's lecture, he would have been forced to recognize that Bernstein is just as adamant as he -or any Objectivist for that matter- to reject the reduction of a concept to its definition. Bernstein even considers that a brainless child is still a man: the reified attribute, therefore, cannot be rationality.)<br />Campbell's main argument is that Objectivists tend to drop the context by adopting a view of man that neglects his developmental dimension: &quot;man&quot; is too often identified with &quot;adult human being&quot;, forgetting that a single individual is in fact a sequence, from conceptus to blastula, fetus, neonate, infant, child, adolescent, adult and ultimately geront. Based on this developmental vision of man, Campbell argues that a life begins at conception, and that therefore abortion is murder from that point on. <br />Campbell is not a philosophical genius, and he is at his weakest when presenting the possible exceptions to his positions, which he does in a purely ad hoc manner. Even though I do disagree with the Objectivist position on abortion and consider a fetus to be a human being at least as early as its nervous system is fully formed, I did not find in this more radical pamphlet much material to support my own position.<br />A lot more needs to be done to validate even a moderate anti-abortionist position. In particular, a complete argument would have to deal with the underlying epistemological issues.  For instance, the official Objectivist position holds that an organism cannot be considered an individual unless it is physically separated from the mother, and perceptibly so: there is no such thing as a human being inside another human being. But Ayn Rand in her *Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology* writes that an entity is &quot;that which is welded together physically and about which we can learn something, to which we can ascribe certain properties, as a whole&quot; (p268). And she discusses the example of &quot;inbuilt furniture in a room&quot;, which, she says, &quot;doesn't become entity-less by being attached to the wall; it's still a separate entity, only it's attached to the wall.&quot; (p269) I think this is definitely one of the levels to which the debate on abortion needs to move.<br />Finally, I think Campbell has underestimated the implications of his stand on abortion for the rest of the Objectivist ethics. He does write that &quot;the arguments offered in this essay... have other implications that should lead to explorations in areas in which Objectivism has been notably inadequate&quot; (p8), but he does not really discuss the matter any further. What about Rand's statement that there are no unchosen duties? And if we admit that a woman can be forced by law to support a fetus (to the potential detriment of, say, her own career), aren't we opening the door to altruism, and running the risk of giving moral legitimacy to the welfare state?<br />As far as I am concerned, I believe that the Objectivist position on abortion is much more crucial to the integrity of the philosophy than Campbell (or any other Objectivist) recognizes. Moreover, I think that all the debate on when the fetus becomes a man, the &quot;piece of protoplasm&quot; rhetoric, the potential vs. actual distinction and the discussions on the size and complexity of the fetus are sheer misdirection, as the egoist foundation of the Objectivist ethics logically entails a woman's &quot;right to abortion&quot; *independently* of the status of the fetus, i.e. whether it is human being or not.<br />After all, if we have no moral obligation to forgo even our luxuries to support the starving children of the Third World, why should a mother be obliged to sacrifice her own values- however futile- to the survival of a fetus?<br />For a much more thorough and sophisticated thomistic defense of the strong anti-abortionist position, I recommend Germain Grisez's excellent book *Abortion: The Myths, the Realities and the Arguments*.	2000-08-25

Edgerton argues against tworesilient premises of modern anthropology: cultural relativism and adaptivism.<br />Cultural relativism is the doctrine that there are no universal, objective criteria for evaluating societies, and that cultural beliefs and practices can only be judged from within, relatively to the culture in which they inhere.<br />Adaptivism is the assumption that whatever long-standing beliefs and cultural practices can be observed in a given society must contribute to the adaptation of the members to their environment, otherwise either the beliefs and practices or the society members themselves would have perished.<br />Against these two doctrines, Edgerton argues that it is possible objectively to evaluate all existing societies, based on how well they serve human needs and therefore contribute to the longevity, health (both physical and mental) and happiness of their members. Societies are more or less efficient at serving man's life, from the unsurpassed rationality and productivity of modern western societies, to the superstitious, taboo-ridden and dismally poor communities which anthropologists tend to admire.<br />Examining dozens of examples of so-called &quot;folk&quot; (i.e. small and primitive) societies, Edgerton shows that, contrary to popular belief- and scientific propaganda- they are not necessarily more socially cohesive, peaceful or healthy than the urbanized populations of the West- quite the contrary in fact. More importantly, he demonstrates how the cultural beliefs and practices of the society members themselves are responsible for the evils individuals endure, from depression to sexual mutilation, suicide, starvation, alcoholism, homicide and madness.<br />*Sick Societies* sometimes reads like a catalogue of cultural maladaptation and expert opinion, and would have benefited from a more rigorous organization of its material, a more transparent outline and a better classification of the phenomena described. Though he rarely errs, Edgerton makes the mistake of package-dealing actual cases of exploitation (involving force or political power) with alleged cases of economic exploitation, implicitly giving credit to Marxist dogma. Some of his statements are also very curious: &quot;Child abuse is often a nonrational behavior&quot; p80; &quot;The exploitation of children... has been... exploitive&quot; p81.<br />Despite these very minor flaws, the book is a wonderful case for an objective anthropology, which will fill you with amazement and horror at the extremes of human folly and brutality. I was particularly stunned by the description of the 238 state-supported inhabitants of Duddie's Branch, whose degenerate community could have originated in the dystopian visions of an Ayn Rand, although had she invented it, she would have been accused of political caricature and man-hating hysteria.<br />As companions to this volume, I recommend Keith Windschuttle's *The Killing of History* and Ayn Rand's *Return of the Primitive*.

To be rational, an  individual's ends must not only be &quot;mutually compatible&quot;, but  also &quot;compatible with the requirements of living&quot; (see for  instance Tara Smith's lectures on *Rationality and Objectivity*, published  by Second Renaissance).<br />In Richardson's conception, on the other hand,  rationality is reduced to coherence, and reality is thrown out of the  window: &quot;rationality in deliberation is largely a matter of the mutual  fit among commitments&quot; (p277). What he is concerned with is &quot;a  rationality relative to individuals' initial commitments&quot; (p231).  Connection to reality he considers to be something else than rationality  which he calls &quot;objectivity&quot;, the &quot;possibility&quot; of  which he discusses in chapter 48, page 304 of this 307-page book.<br />As a  result, what Richardson's theory of rational interpersonal deliberation  boils down to is a theory of compromise, or the &quot;dialectical  softening&quot; of &quot;hardened positions&quot;, which recommends  starting from some proposition on which the two parties can agree and then  expanding outward, both abstracting and concretizing the proposition to  enable a rough agreement on the question at issue.<br />The example Richardson  chooses to illustrate this process, a debate between a Western liberal and  a traditionalist Sunni on the question of rape, I personally found  unconvincing. According to the author, both parties can initially agree on  the fact that &quot;rape is wrong&quot;. However, since they have different  definitions of what constitutes rape and of the concept of  &quot;wrong&quot;, I fail to see how this can count anything more than  verbal agreement. And second, if rationality truly is merely a matter of  making commitments fit, I was disappointed to see the author  &quot;softening&quot; the Sunni's &quot;hardened positions&quot; and not  the Western liberal's. It would have been much more enlightening to see  Richardson attempt to show how a &quot;rational&quot; fit between  commitments could have been achieved by making the liberal come to the  conclusion that after all, it was proper to have 13-old Jehan Mina flogged  and imprisoned for five years for having been gang-raped.<br />All things  considered, even though Richardson does make a few good points on the  concept of final end, the incommensurability of ends and the futility of  explaining choice by invoking &quot;preferences&quot;, I found the book  typical of most modern academic philosophy, consisting mostly of platitudes  interspersed with much hair-splitting and scholarly references to such  academic idols as Quine, Wittgenstein and Rawls.<br />If you are really  interested in rationally selecting your ends, I would rather recommend such  books as Tara Smith's *Viable Values* or Germain Grisez's books on ethics,  which have the merit of starting from reality and human nature instead of  initial personal commitments.	2000-08-15

But it was  probably her experience with *Music of the Spheres*, almost completely  rewritten and then published under the title *Probe* without any  explanation, which led her to shun the Star Trek franchise and develop her  interest in the Vulcans in a new context. Thus she created the Others,  extraterrestrials sharing with the Vulcans not only their philosophy of  pacifism, vegetarianism and devotion to science, logic and emotional  control, but also many physiological peculiarities (such as the pointed  ears and the mating cycle) and cultural traits (such as, for the initiated,  the equivalents of kas wahn and tal shaya).<br />In the *Others* trilogy, this  offshoot of the Vulcan race (who knows itself to have been seeded on the  planet by offworlders from a desert planet) has undergone the same process  of cultural evolution as its forefathers: hundreds of thousands of years of  bloody warfare until their conversion to a life of peace of logic. But this  hard-earned peace may not last forever, for the Others are not the only  inhabitants of the planet: far from their prosperous and technologically  developed Archipelago, on the Mainland, lives an indigenous race, the  People, similar in many respects to the humans, in whose midst, out of  sheer curiosity, the Others send their Monitors, cultural observers bound  by some equivalent of Starfleet's Prime Directive.<br />The protagonist and  narrator of this saga, an &quot;intellectually challenged&quot; (by Other  standards) woman named Lingri the Inept, who describes herself as &quot;a  poet among a race of scientists&quot;, is one of these Monitors, and the  *Other* trilogy is the story of her life and the fate of the two  civilizations as the People finally discover the existence of the  Others.<br />The *Others* trilogy is a strange literary entity. Modernist in  its style, it is written as a collage, in the manner of John Brunner's  *Stand on Zanzibar*, alternating elements of narration with extracts from  documents internal to the world described- such as Chronicles, news  reports, etc. The narration itself does its best never to be linear, though  not to the point of dissolution, as in many modernist novels: the main  thread is always interrupted by stories within stories, flashbacks,  intruding memories, giving to the series a very introspective dimension,  verging on rumination and what I would be tempted to call emotional  pornography (i.e. a kind of almost obsessive wallowing in intense  emotions.)<br />The potential reader of this series should also be warned  about the author's aggressive feminism, her penchant for wordplay and  sometimes pointless neologisms, archaisms and typographical oddities, and  her morbid fascination with torture, genocide, rape, famine, prostitution  and all the extremes of human (or Other) suffering. Those who already found  *Dwellers* harrowing, for instance, will probably meet the limits of their  endurance, all the more so as, contrary to the professionally published  Star Trek novels, the *Others* is not limited in its use of foul language,  explicit sexual references, scatology and depictions of &quot;graphic and  gruesome&quot; brutality.<br />However delighted I was to discover a treatment  of the Vulcans emancipated from the stifling editorial policies of the Star  Trek novels, and however haunting and rhapsodic I concede the series to be,  I must say my overall opinion of it is very mixed, and I would only  recommend it to amateurs of (superior) modernist literature, women with a  deep-seated resentment of their male counterparts and, of course, Vulcan  completists.	2000-08-06

It is, if you want, a kind of  field-test for Grisez's thomistic ethics, as he tries to answer two hundred  real-life moral questions &quot;not yet the subject of explicit or clearly  applicable Church teachings.&quot;<br />Refusing both the authoritarian  approach to moral guidance, which either gives people a rule and tells them  to obey it or grants them an exception to such a rule, and the subjectivist  approach which merely tells them to &quot;follow their conscience&quot;,  Grisez offers detailed answers, fully justified in terms of the moral  principles developed in the first two volumes. The book devotes about four  pages to each question, each of which is presented in a personal letter,  detailing the &quot;purposes, difficulties, commitments and apparent  options&quot; inherent in the situation. Grisez then offers a one-paragraph  analysis of the question, before presenting an in-depth, three-page  treatment. Though there are no chapter divisions, the questions are clearly  thematized, ranging from questions about sexual morality to problems  arising in the practice of business, medicine, education and law.<br />The  book also includes two very interesting theoretical appendixes updating the  reflections presented in the first two volumes. In the first of these  appendixes Grisez recognizes that his previous treatment of the &quot;modes  of responsibility&quot; was unsatisfactory, and that some of them are  reducible to others. Interestingly, this defeats Grisez's attempt to  identify the modes with the Beatitudes, which I always believed to be an  exercise in futility and wishful thinking.<br />I recommend *Difficult Moral  Questions* to two different kinds of readers: first, those with limited  acquaintance with thomistic ethics, who will discover an extremely  fine-grained system of moral decision, much more subtle and sound than the  thou-shalt-nots we usually associate with religion; and second, those who  want to confront their own moral principles to difficult real-life  scenarios, so as to see what kind of guidance- if any- these principles  offer.	2000-08-05

Tibor Machan has published many volumes, but I wonder whether he has ever written a *book*, i.e. a work evincing the architectural virtue of  integrity which Howard Roark stands for in *The Fountainhead*. In my review  of his *Ayn Rand*, I deplored a lack of system and hierarchy, attributing  it to the fact that the volume is a hastily put together collection of  disparate articles. As I opened *The Business of Commerce*, I expected to  find a much more tightly organized work, deserving of a more glowing  review. But what I realize now is that I have been much too generous with  the former volume.<br />What Machan is trying to do, in effect, is to give us  Objectivism without the structure. This he does by writing (or co-writing)  volumes such as this one, which follow no logical pattern but circle round  and round, coming back again and again to the same topics and quotes,  always &quot;suggesting&quot; (a favorite verb of his) but never ever  *establishing* anything.<br />*The Business of Commerce: Examining an  Honorable Profession* is supposed to offer a panorama of business bashing  in Western culture, together with an analysis of its roots and a refutation  of its premises. There is indeed a kind of panorama, but it is at best  impressionistic and widely scattered. There is an analysis, identifying a  dualistic view of man as the basic root of hostility to business, but it is  so rambling and redundant that it exasperates more than it enlightens. As  for the refutation of the premises of business bashing, it is always  tentative, hypothetical, referring the reader to other works or further  chapters (where a point is said to be &quot;discussed in greater  detail&quot;), never concluding anything and ultimately leaving the various  remarks floating in some sort of undifferentiated intellectual  goo.<br />Machan and Chester never really *develop* their arguments: they  content themselves with accumulating (and reiterating) a series of  unintegrated, out-of-context points which never definitively answer the  positions they are supposed to be refuting- all this, I suppose, to avoid  the ultimate intellectual sin of dogmatism, of which Machan probably  considers more disciplined Objectivist philosophers, like Leonard Peikoff,  to be guilty. The authors' recommendations for the teaching of business  ethics seem to apply just as well to their own work: &quot;Here some  measure of thoroughness and even-handedness in the presentation and  discussion is about all that can reasonably be achieved. It is improper to  avoid this difficulty [i.e. the divergences between different moral  systems] by simply becoming an advocate of one's own position...&quot;<br />I am  not saying that Machan and Chester are ever really *wrong* on any specific  issue. As they are merely rewording Ayn Rand's conclusions and arguments,  on the contrary, they are most often right. But the book is so unstructured  that it is almost impossible to remain in focus while reading it- an  impression I also got from Machan's *Ayn Rand*, but which I attributed to  the fact that I was familiar with most of the material and hence was  occasionally bored.<br />In addition, Machan and Chester seem to be reluctant  to admit just how much their own philosophy owes to Rand. When stressing  that values presuppose living entities, they quote Karl Popper. When  asserting that man's basic freedom is the freedom to think or not, they  quote Emerson. And when defending the value of money, they do not even  quote Francisco d'Anconia's money speech in *Atlas Shrugged*, even though  most of their points are in it.<br />My recommendation, therefore, is to save  your time and money and go directly to the source.	2000-08-02

Machan<br />Unlike most independent Ayn Rand scholars, who tend to consider themselves as superior  professionals correcting the childish blunders of an incompetent amateur,  Tibor Machan, as the above quote suggests, is a respectful commentator who  correctly recognizes that Ayn Rand was a major philosopher and that most of  what Randian scholars today can hope to accomplish is to polish up some  aspects of her philosophical system, develop new applications of it and  confront the latest batch of criticisms from academia. As far as his  personal philosophy is concerned, he seems to have accepted most of the  fundamentals of Objectivism, and in most contemporary philosophical  battles, he is generally on the right side, defending free-will against  determinism, ethical cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism, the free society vs.  welfare statism and marxism, and the morality of business against leftist  and conservative smears. I would therefore consider him an estranged friend  of Objectivism, to be distinguished from the self-styled &quot;sympathetic  observers&quot; of the philosophy who in the next breath call Rand a  pseudo-philosopher.<br />Unfortunately, Machan tends to suffer from a lack of  system and hierarchy in his writings, and nowhere is this clearer than in  the present book. Compared to Peikoff's *Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn  Rand* or even Gotthelf's *On Ayn Rand*, which are beautifully structured  and clearly distinguish fundamentals from derivatives, Machan's *Ayn Rand*  is much less integrated and systematic.<br />This lack of system of course  need not be a reflection of Machan's own mental functioning, even though he  does have a penchant for pluralism and eclecticism, but is probably due to  the way the book was put together: *Ayn Rand* is essentially a disjointed  collection of articles previously published in various reviews, newsletters  and books. Chapter 4, &quot;Rand's Rational Individualism&quot;, for  instance, is a slightly edited copy of chapter 10 of *The Philosophical  Thought of Ayn Rand*.<br />Machan's lack of enthusiasm for philosophical  hierarchy does sometimes affect his conclusions, though. For instance, when  he states that &quot;in some parts of his moral philosophy and in politics,  Kant was closer to [Rand's] own ideas than are most other  philosophers&quot; (p117), he clearly shows his rejection of the  Objectivist tenet that one cannot understand a statement out of the whole  hierarchy of a man's philosophical ideas. This may also explain why he  feels sympathetic to the libertarians and leans to the &quot;moral  tolerationist&quot; wing of Objectivism.<br />Anyway, I do recommend this book  as a good overview of Objectivism, and perhaps as a better *introduction*  to this philosophy than Gotthelf's very compact volume (though the latter  is a more reliable statement of the content of the philosophy). Machan   makes interesting comments on the distinction between derivation and  deduction and he identifies a few contemporary philosophers whose views are  very similar to Objectivism. His more haphazard reflections on  &quot;Problems Left for Objectivism&quot; however suffer from a lack of  familiarity with the more recent taped material and simple  misinterpretations of Objectivist tenets. (For instance, though he has read  *We The Living*, he asks: &quot;Cannot a work of art be quite excellent,  yet... sad? Tragic?&quot;, perpetuating a common caricature of the  Objectivist esthetics.) Finally, I must say I found some of the statements  in the book cryptic or highly dubious: &quot;Rand's foundationalism can be  characterized as post-epistemological&quot; or &quot;Rand's approach is  also consistent with... an (almost) anything-goes, (almost) Feyerabendian  laissez-faire attitude towards the methods of factual investigation&quot;.	2000-07-31

Flew takes the following statement from *The  Fountainhead*: &quot;No man can live for another... It is impossible in  concept&quot;; interprets it as meaning that no action can be unselfish and  self-sacrificing; easily refutes the latter; and then blames Rand for her  &quot;false conclusion&quot;, her &quot;lapse&quot; and the  &quot;mess&quot; she got herself into. Unfortunately for him, Rand was not  saying that it is impossible ever to *act* in a self-sacrificial way, but  that it was impossible consistently to *live* for another, which is totally  different, and which I do not think Flew would be able to refute. As for  his comment that &quot;Rand is... mistaking it that all human relationships  are or should be trading transactions&quot;, I surmise it is based on too  literal an interpretation of the &quot;trader principle&quot;, which is the  Objectivist alternative to predatory egoism and altruism. Finally, the  refutation of the Objectivist principle that there is no conflict of  interest among rational men is based on an unjustified reading of  &quot;interest&quot; as synonymous with &quot;desire&quot;.<br />But the nadir  of this collection is probably Wallace Matson's &quot;Rand on  Concepts&quot; which claims to reformulate the Objectivist theory of  concept-formation in a way that &quot;preserves what is of value in Rand's  treatment&quot; and then proceeds to get rid of concepts altogether,  claiming they are a dispensable &quot;mysterious and subjective... third  entity between word and thing&quot;!<br />Of the ten essays included here, I  would say that the five written by the better-informed Ayn Rand scholars  are worth reading and often contain interesting observations and criticisms  (though none that are so earth-shattering as to really threaten the  structure of Objectivism), while the other five, when they are not  off-topic, are generally lame.	2000-07-31

Using Aristotle as  her starting point and foil, she shows what insights the three Hellenistic  schools added to his psychology (such as, for instance, the crucial  discovery of the unconscious), what dangers they identified in the  passionate life he advocated, and what ways they found to avert them. One  thing I learned in this book for instance is that the original Skeptics  were not as nihilistic as their contemporary equivalents, but that their  all-encompassing doubting was a means of protecting themselves from  intellectual vulnerability and fostering a eudaimonistic  equanimity.<br />Rather disturbingly, Nussbaum concludes that each individual  has to choose between a life of deep emotional commitments that might lead  to destructive anger and a life freed from the risk of such anger at the  cost of his humanity. She herself seems to favor the former.<br />*The Therapy  of Desire* is unlike most modern philosophy books in that it attempts to  move philosophy &quot;beyond the academy to take its place in the daily  lives of human beings&quot;. Combining abstract arguments with insightful  real-life illustrations and the literary analysis of works such as  Lucretius's *De Rerum Natura* and Seneca's *Medea*, it weaves a very  intricate picture of man's emotional life and the profound moral choices it  involves.<br />My only reservation about the book concerns the author's  feminist and Marxist leanings.<br />The former manifest themselves in an  obsessive infatuation with the pronoun &quot;she&quot; (to the point of  inserting it in quotes from the Stoics) and occasional diatribes against  our patriarcal society which &quot;turns half of its members into  possessions, both deified and hated, the other half into sadistic keepers,  tormented by anxiety&quot;.<br />As for Nussbaum's Marxism, it reveals itself  in citations from Marx and Engels' writings, which seem designed solely to  give them visibility, and a general tendency to see people as &quot;victims  of false social advertising... convinced in their hearts that they cannot  possibly live without their hoards of money, their imported delicacies,  their social standing, their lovers&quot;. According to her, &quot;nothing  is more urgent in contemporary society than the reasoned critique of  limitless wealth-maximizing and power-seeking&quot; (notice the package  deal). Moreover, Nussbaum's sympathies for ancient philosophers seem to be  dictated mostly by the openness of their schools to women and &quot;the  excluded&quot;- which means that even though she turns out to be closer to  Aristotle than the other schools, she clearly dislikes him. As for her  brief forays into political philosophy, they remain strategically vague,  but it is not difficult, given the context, to guess what she means when  she advocates &quot;a politics of gradualism and mercy&quot;.<br />For all its  biases, I highly recommend this marvellous exploration of hellenistic  philosophy. But I sincerely hope that in the future, scholars  uncontaminated by Marxism will intervene to prevent the recuperation of  Epicureanism and especially Stoicism by the academic left.<br />(As antidotes  to Nussbaum's attacks on &quot;greed&quot;, I recommend Edwin Locke's *The  Prime Movers*; George Reisman's *Capitalism*; and the complete works of Ayn  Rand.)	2000-07-29

They attempt to merge Justice and Mercy by dissolving them in sentimental goo. Mercy is blinded by the goo, and  Justice can see. In consequence, injustice becomes pervasive, and merciless  government preys upon the citizenry in the name of Justice.» - Clarence B.  Carson.<br />A few years ago, while riding on a train, I heard a teenager  explain to a group of friends: «As I see it, to be right-wing is to be for  the rich, and to be left-wing is to be for the poor.»<br />Unfortunately, the  political philosophy of most adults today- including many college  professors- is not much more sophisticated. Everybody «knows» that if there  are so many homeless people around, it is because, contrary to  «laissez-faire rhetoric», wealth does not «trickle down», and because  stingy right-wingers in the government are blocking the necessary  legislation.<br />Well, think again.<br />In *The War on the Poor*, Clarence  Carson shatters the myth that the left is «for» the poor, showing how the  failure of decades of government programs to eradicate poverty is due  neither to insufficient funding nor to the corruption of government  officials, but to the simple fact that, by its very nature, poverty cannot  be eliminated by redistribution or any other use of force (which is all the  government, as such, is capable of.)<br />Originally published in 1969, four  years after the second major wave of federal welfare legislation originated  by the Johnson administration, and reedited in 1991 with a new preface and  two additional chapters, the book starts with a profound truth: just as  raising prices are not inflation but a symptom of it, the lack of money is  not poverty but a consequence of it. Poverty Carson shows to be the failure  to support oneself by one's own productive efforts, «the failure to produce  what is wanted [by other producers] in sufficient quantity to rise above  the level of poverty.»<br />He then goes on to demonstrate how the various  forms of government intervention in the economy send innumerable false  signals to producers and would-be producers, resulting in the misallocation  of resources and, therefore, impoverishment. And, this is the crux of his  thesis, to those false signals, the poor are especially vulnerable.<br />As  with all of Carson's books, the arguments do not consist in pure theory,  though the author, who is familiar with both classical and Austrian  economics and benefited from the advice of his colleague Hans Sennholz, is  far from incapable of such theorizing. No: what you will get is a very  common-sensical and down-to-earth treatment of the subject, documenting the  whole chain of cause and effect from socialist ideas (which Americans will  always welcome with open arms so long as you manage to find a catchy name  for them), to government programs, to the elderly woman who gets mugged in  the street and her daughter's nervous breakdown.<br />Denouncing the evils of  government «aid» to farmers, people removal in the name of «urban renewal»,  union violence against non-unionized workers and business-destroying  regulations, Carson makes a vibrant and humane case for the repeal of  welfare legislation and other forms of interventionism, demonstrating that  in the war on the poor that is being waged in the world today, the  pretended philanthropists of the left are the hawks, and the allegedly  heartless and reactionary classical liberals, the doves.	2000-07-25

Hill: Empire Builder of the Northwest (The Oklahoma Western Biographies)	Books	3	35	43	N	N	An interesting biography of a business genius	«The wealth of the country, its capital, its credit, must be saved from the predatory poor as well as the predatory rich, but above all from the predatory politician» - James J. Hill.<br />In her 1962 lecture, «America's  Persecuted Minority : Big Business», Ayn Rand distinguished two types of  entrepreneurs, whom Burton Folsom Jr. was later to label  «economic» and  «political»: «self-made men who earned their fortunes by personal ability,  by free trade on a free market» and «men with political pull, who made  fortunes by means of special privileges granted to them by the government.»  And according to her, James Jerome Hill was an arch-representative of the  former group, because he built his transcontinental railroad, the Great  Northern, «without any federal help whatever.»<br />Michael P. Malone's  admiration for Hill, on the other hand, is much more moderate (and for  those who think such moderation unjust, he is kind enough to direct us to  Albro Martin's «highly laudatory» two-volume biography of Hill, *James J.  Hill and the Opening of the Northwest*)<br />For instance, he puts the phrase  «self-made man» in quotation marks when applying it to Hill, for, he says,  Hill's fortune «sprout... from the rich seedbed of federal subsidy»: by  completing his first large scale project in time (the Manitoba railroad),  Hill managed to reap the «seventh largest of the original seventy-five  railroad grants», located mostly in the fertile Red River valley.  Therefore, Malone says, we should forget the «hoariest, and most  mischievous, of all the many legends surrounding Hill»- the one perpetrated  by Ayn Rand and, after her, Burton Folsom Jr.- which «rhapsodizes about how  he built a great transcontinental line without the benefit of a federal  land grant.»<br />Was Hill therefore just another political entrepreneur? I  don't think so.<br />First, Malone here seems to be conflating federal  subsidies and land grants. A federal subsidy, in myunderstanding, is a  transfer of money or produced goods, which by its very essence involves a  forced redistribution and is therefore immoral. A land grant, on the other  hand, consists in the granting of a non-improved natural resource to its  actual developer, in a good approximation of the Lockean ideal of  acquisition through labour. What makes it a form of «federal aid» is only  the government's assumption of the power to acquire land  by some  non-Lockean process (i.e. by fiat, or in this case, purchase from another  government that had acquired the land by fiat.)<br />Second, the lands granted  to the railroads actually owed most of their value to the building of the  roads. As Clarence Carson explains in *Throttling the Railroads* : «the  lands granted [however fertile] were worth little to nothing on the market  at the time they were granted.» This was so because cultivating those lands  would have been economically hopeless without the cheap transportation to  population centers provided by the railroads.<br />And third, Malone's  metaphor makes it sound as though Hill's fortune merely grew out of the  «soil» of federal subsidy by some natural, automatic process or, to mix  metaphors, a snowball effect. Actually, the building of the Manitoba  railroad is only chapter 2 of the biography, and there are 6 more chapters  to go in which Malone himself offers ample illustration that the building  of Great Northern and the rest of Hill's achievements did not simply  «sprout» from the government's bounty.<br />Whatever the motivations for  Malone's very mixed final estimate of Hill, he does grant his subject a  certain number of admirable character traits, which confirm Edwin Locke's  conclusions in *The Prime Movers*. For instance, Malone singles out the  following as Hill's distinctive traits in chapter 4: «his remarkable  mastery over every detail of what was now a far-flung operation, his vision  of the inevitable triumph of transcontinental through-carriers [together  forming Locke's virtue of «independent vision»], his insufferable [Malone  again...] iron will and work ethic [Locke's «drive to action»], and his  recruitment of an able coterie of men [Locke's «love of ability in  others»].» And this is only Malone himself trying to summarize Hill's  virtues : the book offers much more concrete material for you to make your  own identifications and corroborate Locke's analysis.<br />The flaw of *Empire  Builder of the Northwest*, in my opinion, is that it is merely interesting  and informative where, given its subject, it could have been epic. Malone  himself is no great enthusiast of economic freedom: at one point, he refers  to «the simplistic bromides of laissez-faire». Moreover, the book only  offers two maps, which makes following some of the descriptions rather  difficult. However, if you do not have the time for Albro Martin's longer  work and are frustrated by the mere 22 pages in Folsom's *The Myth of the  Robber Barons*, Malone's book remains a good introduction to the life of an  immensely productive and hardworking man, who was also a voracious reader,  a faithful husband and- as the opening quote reveals- a «true believer in  the virtues of unfettered capitalism».	2000-07-25
US	53093154	R12CSYOARQEVY1	0814405703	881302264	The Prime Movers: Traits of the Great Wealth Creators	Books	5	23	23	N	N	The essence of success	It seems to be a universal fact of life that the really great accomplishments in any human field of endeavour come from a very small percentage of the people actually engaged in it. If you take the best  movies of all time, for instance, you will find that many of them were  written, produced or directed by the same people. Greatness is not «fair»,  it is not equally distributed among men : it is the achievement of a few.  But why *those* few ? Are they selected by some kind of cosmic lottery-  genetic or otherwise- or are they self-made ? Is greatness fundamentally  something that happens to you, or something that you make happen  ?<br />Limiting himself to the study of greatness in the field of business,  Edwin Locke defends the latter explanation. Based on a close analysis of  the lives of 70 great wealth-creators, his book identifies and discusses  the seven essential characteristics of business heroes from the late 19th  century to the year 2000.<br />Locke argues that wealth creation is  essentially an *intellectual* process, contrary to the claims of those whom  Ayn Rand called the «mystics of muscle», who hold labour to be the  exclusive source of wealth. More than that, wealth creation is a  *spiritual* achievement, i.e. one that is made possible by a man's virtues  - the various facets of his rationality.<br />Therefore, all of the «traits of  the great wealth creators» identified by Locke are either intellectual or  moral, i.e. they pertain to businessmen's thinking, motivation, judgment or  character- as against their sex, race, family situation or environment. In  other words, they are all volitional : they are not traits that you either  have or do not have, but products of your own choices- the most basic of  which, as Ayn Rand has shown, is the choice to focus on reality or to evade  it : chosing to focus, chosing to be reality-oriented, is the root of all  greatness.<br />Edwin Locke's book is brief, concise, filled with real-life  examples and neatly organized : after a chapter on the nature of wealth  creation and its cultural and political pre-conditions, he devotes one  chapter to each of the seven traits and concludes with a promising chapter  entitled «How To Make a Billion Dollars», in which he tells you how to  apply the traits to your own life, rejects alternative explanations of  business success, and deals briefly with a few issues that hamper the  pursuit of wealth, such as the doctrine of «giving back», antitrust  legislation, egalitarianism and the demonization of «greed».<br />Apart from  the biographical recommendations to be found at the end of each chapter,  «The Prime Movers» can be profitably complemented by Edwin Locke's own  lectures (produced by Second Renaissance) on « American Business Heroes»  (Rockefeller, Carnegie, Hill and Morgan) ; «The Life and Achievements of  Thomas Edison» ; and «Heroic Business Dynasties».	2000-07-18

I was therefore  really seduced by the promise of the subtitle of this book, «The Unity of  Knowledge», and Jared H. Diamond's comment that it «attempts nothing less  than a synthesis of all ways of knowing». Moreover, «consilience» is such a  beautiful word that I simply could not resist ordering the book.<br />But what  does Wilson mean by this unusual term ? Though he tries not to break the  news too abruptly, it finally appears that «consilience» means nothing more  than old-fashioned «reductionism» (even though Wilson does distinguish  «consilience by reduction» from «consilience by synthesis»), and was  probably chosen over its infamous synonym so as not to scare the potential  buyers of the book.<br />*Consilience* is therefore a treatise on Wilson's  dream of a unification of the whole field of knowledge, one that would be  effected neither by the adoption of a common method (logic and the  scientific method) nor by that of a common language (mathematics), but by  the reduction of the higher-order sciences, including the humanities, «all  the way down» to biology and physics, the latter being the door out of  labyrinth of perplexity, and reduction, Ariadne's thread.<br />The already  achieved consilience of biology and physics and the recent attempts at  making psychology consilient with biology (via sociobiology and the  neurosciences) serve as the basis for Wilson's hope that economics, the  social sciences, the interpretation of the arts and even ethics will one  day be consilient with the lower-order sciences.<br />Of course, such  reductions would imply several modifications in our worldview. Free-will,  for instance, would have to go, revealing itself to be a mere «illusion »,  the self being «the entity that *seems* to make... choices». But do not worry  : «because the individual mind cannot be fully known and predicted, the  self can go on passionately believing in its free-will» and this, Wilson  says, is «fortunate», for confidence in one's free will is «biologically  adaptive»... This obstacle to reduction being taken care of, economics can  then aspire to become a real science, i.e. a science with real, specific  predictive power, freed from the simplistic models of homo economicus after  taking as its premises the conclusions of a renovated, biologicized  psychology.<br />What about ethics ? As part of his attempt to reduce it to  biology, Wilson resurrects the 18th-century theory of moral sentiments, by  showing how human beings are shaped by «epigenetic rules», «regularities in  development in anatomy, physiology, cognition and behavior » which  predispose us to act in ways our morality sanctions. That such  predispositions exist seems to be a well-documented fact. That they can  justify our ethics, however, as Wilson suggests, is philosophically  untenable. But then for Wilson, ethics is just the «codification» of social  preferences, the «translation of... the public will».<br />For all my  reservations about Wilson's reductionist agenda (which he tries to make  palatable by equivocating between «reductionism», a philosophical program,  and «reduction», a legitimate scientific practice), I must say I was  exhilarated by some of the prospects opened by the book, and felt a deep  sympathy for the author himself. An admirer of the great figures of the  Enlightenment, he sees himself as a modern heir to their philosophical  enterprise, defending «the grail of objective truth» against the  irrationalism of the postmoderns (to whom, in my opinion, he is a little  too charitable, because he is himself innocent of any intellectual  dishonesty). Rejecting religion, he nevertheless recognizes people's need  for a «sacred narrative», but suggests that they should seek it in science,  for, he says, «the true evolutionary epic, retold as poetry, is as  intrinsically ennobling as any religious epic. Material reality discovered  by science already possesses more content and grandeur than all religious  cosmologies combined.»<br />Such lines are almost inebriating. But then again,  perhaps it is only the philosophical corruption of this century that makes  books like «Consilience», for all its flaws and excesses, seem like a  breath of fresh air. For a more cogent take on the integration of the  higher-order branches of knowledge, I would recommend Leonard Peikoff's  lectures on «Unity in Epistemology and Ethics» (available from Second  Renaissance), and Objectivist literature generally.	2000-07-15

Some  of the articles are just reactions to annual conferences of the AAAS which  Pournelle attended, giving snapshots of scientific research in the late  1970s. Most of the articles were already partly obsolete when they were  gathered in book format, so one may wonder at their relevance twenty years  after the publication of the book. Pournelle's constant marveling at the  computing power of his pocket calculator is a reminder of how far we have  travelled since the articles were written : much has been learned about the  planets of the solar system, for instance, and Pournelle already recognized  in 1979 that his schemes for the terraformation of Venus were extremely  simplistic. Moreover, given the format the essays were originally published  in, the book lacks cohesion and progression, and is often redundant.<br />The  message of the book is very similar to that of Julian Simon's « The  Ultimate Resource », except Simon focuses on the Earth's resources, while  Pournelle extends the discussion to those of the whole solar system.  Another difference is that Pournelle, though obviously sympathetic to free  enterprise (twice quoting Freeman Dyson's remark that America was settled  by enterprising individuals), is quite tolerant of big government budgets,  going so far as to put forward his ideas for a better allocation of  government research funds. (As an Objectivist, I am personally in favour of  the complete privatization of scientific research.)<br />He does a good job  showing that most sources of «soft energy» popular with the  environmentalists, such as wind and garbage, will not fill man's energetic  needs, and that nuclear energy is the only solution in the short term. In  its defense of nuclear energy, the book echoes the message of Pournelle and  Niven's «Lucifer's Hammer», where mankind finds its post-cataclysmic  salvation by maintaining a nuclear plant in activity.<br />At times, Pournelle  is extremely naïve, as when he assumes that one day, the acquisition of  knowledge will be automated («the computer can squirt the book's contents  directly into your mind» p86) or rendered obsolete by instant hook up with  world databases. He does not seem to realize the importance of the  integration and automatization of knowledge (not to mention filtering !),  which cannot be done without extended periods of intense «chewing» of the  material (to borrow Ayn Rand's term). Pournelle also gratuitously assumes  that there is a «central processing unit» in the brain (p86) - Edelman's  mythical «homonculus»- and that the «basis of consciousness» is either  «matter or structure» (p308.)<br />In addition to this occasional scientific  naïvet&eacute;, probably due to the fact that most of what we know about the brain  we learned during the last two decades, Pournelle also goes over the edge  at times, going so far as to accept the possibility of telepathy (p87) or  UFOs (pp101-113). Perhaps more disgusting, because less blatantly  pseudo-scientific, are his speculations concerning black holes, which seem  to be a haven for the scientists' irrationality. «Time running backward» is  a meaningless phrase, and Hawking's idea that «anything» can come out of a  black hole is simple nonsense.<br />All in all, I would  rather recommend  reading Julian Simon's books, plus up to date speculations about mankind's  future in space.rm.

Call it a victory of hope over experience. My first disappointment  was to discover that about one third of the book is composed of footnotes :  about 1,500 of them, over 150 pages ! Academics tend to consider footnotes  as a badge of superior scholarship, but let's face it : they are nothing  more than material that the author has failed to integrate into the body of  his work, clutter from the cutting room floor whose inclusion merely serves  to hamper the linear process of reading. In this particular case, about 80  pages into the book, I had to quit reading them, so as to concentrate on  the flow of the authors' argument. My second disappointment was that  M&amp;K's book is not what it purports to be, i.e. an analysis or a  systematization of Rand's esthetics. Much of the relevant source material  has been left out or poorly exploited. Rand's art itself could have been  studied as an application of her esthetic principles, but it is not. This  is all the more unjust as the authors devote four pages to an unproduced  scenario which has been judged by many film professionals one of the best  screenplays ever written, if not the best, while they have virtually  nothing to say about Rand's own screenplays for The Fountainhead and  Love Letters. Most of the references to Rand's esthetics are concentrated  in chapters 1 through 4, which analyze the four major essays in Rand's  Romantic Manifesto. The authors agree with the fundamentals of the  Objectivist esthetics, but the criticisms they do make are often very  unfair or unsubstantiated. As an example of the former, they refute Rand's  statement that Vermeer (one of her favorite painters) often chose as  subjects folks next door... to kitchens by remarking that only one of his  paintings,Maidservant Pouring Milk, even suggests the vicinity of a  kitchen. Isn't that a little too literal a reading ? As an example of  unsubstantiated or gratuitous criticism, here is how they reject Rand's  classification of the screenplay as a form of drama : [Rand] may have been  somewhat off the mark in considering the screenplay as a species of drama.  As Susanne Langer suggests, the strucure of film is closer to narrative  fiction that to drama (p361 n 62.) What we have here is an arbitrary  disagreement supported by an argument from authority. This is all the more  irresponsible as M&amp;K's rejection of Rand's theory of the screenplay as  drama renders them unable to understand why voiceovers and lengthy  monologues are inappropriate in film. My third disappointment with the book  is that it is mostly focused on negatives, rather than stressing the  positive. In fact, M&amp;K are merely using Rand as a springboard (or  selling argument ?) to launch their own attack on modernist art. However  cogent and salutary this attack is, I think Rand's own attitude towards  modernist art was much more rational : there's nothing to say about it,  it belongs on a rubbish dump, let's move on to something that makes sense,  shall we ? In What Art Is, you will learn more than you ever wanted to  know about so-called artists who have friends shoot them in the arm in  public or have their cervix examined by the audience as a form of  performative art, while nothing is said of the genuine artists who, under  Rand's influence, are currently ushering in a second Renaissance in the  arts. Finally, my fourth disappointment with What Art Is is that it fails  to give credit where credit is due. While adopting virtually all the  essentials of Rand's eshetics, M&amp;K spend more time criticizing or  smearing Rand than recognizing her greatness. When mentioning the prospect  of the exctinction of non-art and the rebirth of art, they do not mention  the role of Objectivism in that process but hope that their book will play  some small role in hastening that renaissance. Even more blatant is their  injustice towards Leonard Peikoff, whose great accomplishments all  independent Objectivist scholars invariably belittle. Not only is  Peikoff's chapter on Art in Objectivism : The Philosophy of Ayn Rand more  or less disregarded, but his 1993 lecture on Modernism and Madness  (published in The Intellectual Activist, November 1994) is dismissed to a  footnote (n. 6 p391) which is not even listed in the index. Such an  oversight is all the more troubling as much of &quot;What Art Is&quot; is  only a lengthy paraphrase Peikoff's argument in this lecture. For all my  strong reservations, however, I am not saying that this book should not be  read. Its thorough documentation of the irrationalism of the culture of the  twentieth century may provide intellectual ammunition for more focused  arguments, and the book does have a few good points to make on Rand's  esthetics. M&amp;K's comment on architecture, for instance, could be  reduced to a valid syllogism : if  (1) art is a selective re-creation of  reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments and (2)  architecture... does not recreate reality (two statements from Rand's  Romantic Manifesto), then (3) architecture is not an art. However, I  think it is as unjustified to call this book What Art Is : The Esthetic  Theory of Ayn Rand as it would be to call a Rand-influenced catalogue of  the horrors of the gulag What Capitalism Is : The Political Theory of Ayn  Rand.	2000-06-30

These expectations were partly  satisfied with the first volume, which describes Jefferson's formative  years- if such years can indeed be set apart from the life of a man who  never ceased to grow. However, as I closed this fourth volume, I was forced  to admit that I had gained very little new insight in its purported  subject, and that the whole volume had proved rather tedious to read.<br />The  six-volume series has been described as « a major achievement in the  half-way house between history and biography ». Laudatory though this  comment may be, it summarizes for me the major flaw of Malone's enterprise  : its failure as biographical writing. Nowhere is this clearer than in this  fourth volume, where Jefferson himself seems to recede in the background  while the author retells the most tedious details of the workings of his  administration, however unrelated to Jefferson himself.<br />The «  un-biographical » character of the work is reinforced by its format :  instead of following Jefferson chronologically, Malone has chosen to offer  us a series of chapters organized around such themes as the executive  appointments, Marbury vs. Madison or the Louisiana Purchase, thus imposing  conventional textbook divisions on the organic flow of Jefferson's life. As  a result, the « biography » reads as a series of historical essays, and  certain important topics are relegated to the next volume. Nothing is said  for instance about Jefferson's personal relation with Meriwether Lewis or  his involvement in the preparations of the Lewis and Clarke  expedition.<br />Perhaps even more regrettable is the general impression of  Jefferson given by Malone as a relatively unintellectual man who had  apparently done mostof his reading in his youth and never bothered to  systematize his thinking, being more concerned with his presidential  duties, his social life and the occasional joys of the countryside.<br />Apart  from a few interesting chapters, therefore, such as « The Religion of a  Reasonable Man », and the welcome refutation of the Sally Hemings myth,  this curious hybrid of a volume should be eschewed by those who seek a  genuine understanding of Jefferson the man. To them, David Mayer's « The  Constitutional Thought of Thomas Jefferson », and a good selection of  Jefferson's own writings, should prove much more profitable reading.	2000-05-06

Perhaps the  ablest thinker to answer the call was Germain Grisez (1929-), a modern  Aquinas who responded with a three-volume, three-thousand-page treatise  entitled « The Way of the Lord Jesus » (1983, 1993, 1997). This massive and  brilliant work became the standard textbook in many Catholic seminaries in  the USA, but its fine print and daunting scholarly apparatus severely  restricted its potential audience. To make Grisez's thought accessible to  the general public, therefore, Russell Shaw, a long-time associate of  Grisez's, decided to publish « Fulfillment in Christ », which condenses the  first volume of Grisez's trilogy into a much more digestible 430-page  book.<br />Grisez's ethics starts by inductively identifying a certain number  of basic human goods- « the goods which fulfill persons » or « components  of human full being »- such as life (bodily well-being), knowledge,  skillful performance, interpersonal harmony, self-integration, etc. These  goods enable him to flesh out the first principle of morality, which states  that « In voluntarily acting for human goods and avoiding what is opposed  to them, one ought to choose and otherwise will those and only those  possibilities whose willing is compatible with a will toward integral human  fulfillment ». From this highly abstract principle, Grisez derives a set of  eight « modes of responsibility », which are an intermediate step toward  the development of concrete, applicable moral norms.<br />The first half of  the book is devoted to the presentation of this theory of morality,  brilliantly showing how the incommensurability of the basic human goods  makes free-will possible and utilitarianism unworkable. It includes very  cogent discussions of the Christian concept of sin (includingoriginal sin,  which Grisez tries to integrate with evolution theory !),  the distinction  between venial and mortal sins and the concept of conscience, which is  given a valid definition.<br />The second half, of much less relevance to  non-Christians, deals with such issues as prayer, faith or the moral import  of Catholic rituals, transforming the modes of responsibility into eight «  modes of Christian responses » of a thoroughly theological and altruistic  character.<br />Outside of Objectivism, I consider very few modern  philosophers as actually worth reading, but Grisez is definitely one of  them. If he failed to convert me to Catholicism (or, for that matter,  Christianity), I will forever be grateful to him for enriching and  fine-tuning my moral thinking, and for introducing me to the thought of one  of mankind's most brilliant philosophers, Thomas Aquinas.	2000-04-10
US	53093154	R2SNXTT60QLBIT	0786107960	832191375	Basic American Government	Books	5	51	51	N	N	The most essential modern book on American government	Now out of print and available only as a series of audiotapes, « Basic American Government » was initially published as a massive 480-page volume, not counting the notes, glossary, index, and the 60 pages of firsthand  documents such as the Declaration of Independence, The Federalist N°10 or  the Constitution itself. Its author, Clarence Carson, is the author of more  than 500 articles and about 15 fifteen books, including a six-volume  history of the United States.<br />The book is divided into four sections : -  Section 1 (35p) deals with the basic principles of the American system of  government. It starts by reminding the reader that the United States,  contrary to the platitudes that are mouthed by today's journalists and  politicians, « is not a democracy. It is a Constitutional Federated  Republic. » Carson then goes on to explain what these concepts of «  constitution », « republic » and « federalism » mean exactly, thus  presenting the « sum and substance » of American govenment. - Section 2   (150p) delves into the intellectual background of the American political  system, from authorities such as Aristotle to the English heritage of the  17th and 18th century, including 12 pages on John Locke, Trenchard and  Gordon, William Blackstone and Adam Smith alone. The American colonial  experience, the American Revolution and the Constitutional Convention are  then summarized, but of course with much less detail than in Carson's «  Basic History of the United States » or his « Rebirth of Liberty ». -  Section 3 (130p) traces the evolution of the American system of government  in the 19th century, from the establishment of the Federal Government after  the ratification of the Constitution through the major decisions of the  Supreme Court and the upheaval of the Civil War and Recontruction. -  Section 4  (135p) deals with the 20th century and the advent of Leviathan  (or big government), examining how socialism, by deliberately refusing to  call itself by that name, entered the American mainstream ; and how  Franklin D. Roosevelt « broke the constitutional dam » with his New Deal  and the Court Packing Plan of 1937- a process culminating in a government  that has become « out of control ».<br />First published in 1993, Clarence  Carson's masterful volume « Basic American Government » ranks among his  best, and is to my knowledge the most profound, principled and systematic  treatment of the subject ever printed- far better than R.V. Denenberg's «  Understanding American Politics », and incomparably superior to David  Cushman Coyle's pitiful « The United States Political System and How it  Works».<br />True to the founding principles of the Founding Fathers,  enlightened by a genuine understanding of economic principles (Carson is  well-read in both the classical economists and the Austrians, and is the  author of a helpful treatise on « Basic Economics »), it opens with what I  consider to be the most powerful statement ever printed on the current  condition of the US government : « It would be considerable fraud to do a  book on American government which talked as if the Constitution were still  being substantially observed, that pretended that when Presidents took the  oath of office they intended to observe the bounds set by the Constitution,  that Congressmen recited their pledges with the same intent, and that  Federal judges were still construing the Constitution as it was written. In  sum, any book on American government worthy of the name ought to make clear  how remote from the Constitution the government has become. »<br />Carson's  own suggestions as to how to restore the integrity of the US political  system are extremely simple. As he says, the text of the Constitution  itself is still intact, so what is necessary is merely to make US  government officials obey it. Did you know for instance that, in the  Constitution, « there is no authority granted to levy taxes or to contract  debts to provide for any foreign country » and that « the United States is  specified alone as the beneficiary for all tax collections » ? (p445) More  specifically, Carson suggests repealing the 17th Amendment (which  undermined the federal system by reducing the power of the states to check  the central government) and making it a treason for any US government  official to betray the Constitution.<br />In other words, the way for  Americans to bring the government back to its function of protecting their  rights to « life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness » is simply to make  their servants obey the charter which was initially adopted to limit their  powers.	2000-04-02
US	53093154	R4S4D2FVPDVWV	0847697606	18536685	Viable Values	Books	5	49	51	N	N	Essential reading for serious moral reflection	« Viable Values » is not about ethics, but metaethics : it will not provide you with a code of values with which to guide your life and actions, but help you answer such questions as « why be moral ? » and « is  moral knowledge possible ? »<br />Do not think that these are very abstract  issues which only a professional philosopher would ever consider worth his  time. After all, why are *you* moral and how do you know right from wrong ?  Do you believe that « you just know » ? Then you are an intuitionist, a  position which Tara Smith shows to be untenable. Or do you think that  morality is just a matter of agreeing with others on what behaviour is  mutually acceptable ? Then you are a contractarian, another invalid  position.<br />On the contrary, as Tara Smith explains, the root of morality  is life. You should be moral because you have chosen to live. Morality is a  matter of life and death : to choose the bad is to destroy oneself, to  choose the good is to flourish.<br />You might be tempted to shun this book in  favour of more popular ones offering concrete rules, but none of these  books will give you a good reason to be moral, or a good justification for  the code of value they offer. « Viable Values », on the other hand, will  make an independent moral thinker out of you, equipping you with the  methods and standards by which to judge for yourself.<br />Moreover, this  concise, lucid volume will also direct you to the books that do offer  rational moral guidance, sparing you the costly trial-and-error method that  has wasted so many lives.	2000-03-26
