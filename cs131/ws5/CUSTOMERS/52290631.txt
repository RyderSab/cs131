The plot of the mystery is only moderately interesting or challenging, and Leon herself seems to be in a generally sour mood. The wry and careful observations of Venice tourism and Italian government red-tape have turned into rants and crabbiness that make us wonder if Leon is getting bored with life at the Questura and the Brunetti household. Even the regular cast -- Miss Elettra, Vianello, Patta, Paola, Chiara, Rafi, etc. -- seem to be in a glum place and eager for a fight. For first-time Leon readers some of the earlier books are a better place to start.	2004-01-22

Chapin was a 20-year-old gofer when he was privileged to observe the process that turned a script into one of the great Broadway dazzlers of recent history. He wrote the original text as a college report and the very-detailed examination will be too much for someone who did not see the show or has only marginal interest in Broadway musicals (this reviewer saw the show six times, thanks mainly to the goodness of Producer Hal Prince who offered $2 seats at every performance). Chapin is tireless in descriptions of the way shows are made (everything from union rules to how orchestrations are developed and script changes typed). The big surprise is the total picture of how imagination and inspiration can be whipped into a monumental show.	2003-10-07

Whatever the reason for abandoning Hoag and picking up a new detective duo -- film critic Mitch Berger and trooper Des Mitry -- this introduction leaves us all a little sorry not to have Stewart swaggering around New York and its smart spots. Setting is important to mysteries and while the Connecticut coast serves, it doesn't sizzle the way Handler's earlier books do; no matter how tepid the plot the characters were always wonderfully eccentric. &quot;Blue Blood&quot; makes me curious about the second Berger mystery, but also hopeful that Hoag is only on hiatus, not abandoned.	2002-12-09

There are enough meanderings and red herrings to exhaust even devoted fans, and a plot so mundane and well-tread that on page 50 you dismiss the ultimate solution as too obvious, not worthy of George. Of the recurring characters, Nkata gets the major spotlight while Lynley and Havers drift in and out to less effect than is the rule.

They are too quirky, too unfocused, spread too thin in their duties and affections. But little by little, page by page, you come to care for them. In this one a middle-aged widow examines how her own life has become so unlike anything she hoped or planned it might be. And in her quest to find out how that happened she learns respect for the choices she made and the ways that she coped with circumstances. You have to love her. This is not the place for a new Tyler reader to begin to get to know her, but it is a superb book.

But along comes Mr. Bach, and his portrait only makes us love Hart's version more. Yes, I believe Mr. Bach has researched and read and compiled facts that delineate the real life of a Broadway legend. But by comparison it is also insight into what a creation is &quot;Act One&quot; and the creative process of a playwright and man of the theatre. Hart wrote his own version with the eye of an artist; facts didn't interest him. A great story was in the telling. Facts interest Mr. Bach, and they are very well presented. If any reader is worried that Mr. Bach has been indiscreet, that his palette has too many warts and all, I assure you that he has been careful and admiring. His role as a biographer may have kept him at too much of a distance from the artist, but his book in combination with Hart's is a full-blown, 3-D treatment of a worthy subject. It takes this new book to make you fully appreciate the original, and then grateful for the contrasting study.	2001-05-17

In this one Barnard has created a British village rampant with small-minded hypocrites, petty and pompous. The great fun of the book is not in deft plotting (it's fairly ordinary) but in the take-no-prisoners descriptions of the shallowness and pretentions of small-town life in the 1970s. There is nothing sly about Barnard's ill regard for his villagers; he loathes all characters who are not police officers (and he's not overly kind about most of them either). Some of the references are dated (Enoch Powell is hardly as rich a punchline now as he was then), but there is sufficient wit and sarcasm that has traveled well.	2001-05-02

The characters are familiar Wodehouse types: quaintly erratic and utterly dependable for their supply of humor.

Douglas, best known for the cult favorite &quot;South Wind,&quot; and David, for cook books/good-eating sensibility before that was a genre unto itself, met before WWII and had a brief friendship.

It's true that this is not up to the other two -- and later -- Dunning mysteries, but even early Dunning has qualities to recommend it. The author admits the &quot;rawness&quot; of his work in the highly informative forward. But he has nothing for which to apologize. He has delivered a well-plotted thriller that could use a little more in the way of detailed characterization; everything else is a quibble.	2000-12-04
US	52290631	R12EYJFMD4ZBKO	0679463321	565707898	Killing Time	Books	1	4	5	N	N	And now for something completely different	As a great fan of the first Carr books -- the historical mysteries set in Old New York City -- I looked forward eagerly to his third. It is clear that Carr wants to get out of his historical niche and try his hand at something new; he has set his new book in 2024. His determination to break with the past may be what Carr wants, but it is a great disappointment to this reader. The novel is filled with the coy prognostications of doom and hindsight that seem more smug than inventive and are so familiar in trite examples of that genre. True, he has attempted to create a strange book universe as he did with the New York City of 100 years ago. But it comes off as more a draft for a sci-fi movie than a satisfying read. In fairness to potential readers, I only made it to page 100. It may have gotten better thereafter. Somehow I doubt that.	2000-11-28

Maupin has crafted a creepily odd and seductive psychological mystery that needs to tap into your sense of innocence and surprise; it is what you must bring to the read. At more than one point I was caught up with the &quot;Wow!&quot; of the plot. Maupin manages to mix the inventive and the autobiographical in a way that lends resonance to both elements, and if his emotional nakedness does not unsettle you, the strangeness of the story will pull you in.	2000-11-28

That Wildean wit and off-center logic that are a part of the  characters in all four books are there, but Good Grief! the wading one must  do through tax codes, financial details and fiduciary claptrap. Caudwell  becomes almost pedantic about government regulation on tax matters (will  there be a quiz after?) and that is very tiring. Any of the other three is  a better choice, particularly as a first Caudwell read. (Note: Given a vote  in the matter, I do believe that Prof. Tamar is female, though it seems not  to matter one way or another.)	2000-08-16

But it is completely unedited and riddled throughout with type-os and silly mistakes. Surely no person at the publishing house read this book before it  was released; I'd go so far as to say no one bothered to use spell-check to  detect ludicrous errors. In most cases, the correct spelling or usage is  fairly easy to figure. In one, a &quot;Mrs.&quot; should have been a  &quot;Mr.&quot; and that caused a bit of confusion. Readers appreciate  these budget-priced editions, but couldn't someone at the publishing house  give them a look after they've been scanned into the computer? Surely a  summer intern in the editorial department might even have a good time  reading this pleasant little mystery.	2000-06-05

It shares the flavor of &quot;Strangers on a Train,&quot; that  squirmy, claustrophibic quality of having control pulled from your grasp.  Ripley is fascinating to me -- a completely amoral character for whom you  feel sympathy -- and I find him at his most haunted and haunting in this  book. My one regret: It is the final Ripley adventure.	2000-03-10

This is a very long, static and redundant tale that comes to an abrupt conclusion that could cause mental whiplash. I am curious that the other reader/reviewers who have made entires here find the story and its sudden,  odd and unlikely ending so fascinating. I re-read the last four pages  several times with the hope that the meaning would dawn on me. I get the  facts of the finale, just not the context in which they fit into this  story. I consider myself an avid reader (and one who grasps the plots and  nuances of writing) but this one makes absolutely no sense to me  whatsoever. (I welcome comments from any reader who can clear up the matter  in a private e-mail; I have written to Mr. Cook to ask for an  explanation.). Definitely not worth the effort for me; move on to the next  book on your list.	1999-04-15
