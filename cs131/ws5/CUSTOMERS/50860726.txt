Thorough in its look at tactics and the weapons that are used by the armed forces. I would have liked to see a bit more of a look at what could be next though admittedly the author does answer the question in a way by saying that it's more likely to be more of the same with a lot more electronics until the next big war. And then it'll be lots of surprises. I guess my only complaint about the book is that it's not sexy enough. And considering that real war and the armed forces that gets the job done aren't sexy that's probably as big a compliment as anything else. This book gets an A on the StuPage Reviews.	2004-04-21

But I liked what Tan did with her &quot;biography&quot;. As the title says it is a book of musings. Musings about herself and her writing. Being interested in writing and having enjoyed Amy Tan's writing this was enough to interest me. Her writing and honesty were enough to keep me interested. She talks about her childhood and her mother and how these have not only influenced her life but her writing. She talks about her writing and how she got started writing and the challenges of writing. There's also musings of love, loss, friends and family, trips and journeys battles won and lost. <br />The last musing or chapter deals with an illness/disease she has, Lyme Disease. She is able to talk about it and her struggle to discover and cope with it without coming across as preachy or whiny. She's not looking for undue sympathy or to convert. She is just relating something that has happened to her. If it educates you or causes you to feel some emotion towards her that's good and if not at least now you know. I think that is reflected in a lot of her writing. I for one was glad to listen. I give it an A on the StuPage Reviews.	2004-02-15

As such you get an insider's view on what is needed to be a successful freelancer. There aren't a lot of hints for improving your writing or picking subjects or any thing like that. The author assumes either you have the necessary ability and talent needed or you'll learn soon enough that you don't. Instead the focus is more on what to do to get in the door and stay inside. That is getting the attention of the editor and once you do get it how to keep it. I'll give you the main tip in two sentences. Do good work. Write what the editor asks for, write it well and write it on time. The author goes into more detail and explains more of how to do it. Not a bad investment if you're looking to get into freelancing.

If you've ever read any of Lustbader's other mystery/adventure novels, then you've got the gist of Art Kills. And if you strip away the sub-plots, exotic locales and Eastern themes of his other novels you've got Art Kills exactly. It's like taking a movie and telling the main story in an one hour tv show instead. You don't loose much with this novella. You've got intrigue, tension, violence and a love story all packed together nicely in here. As a quick read it was pretty good. I give it a B on the StuPage.	2003-12-11

A better title might have been: A History of Tim Hortons from the Head of Marketing. Not as snazzy but it gives a truer meaning to what the book is about. Ron Buist in the first half gives you the beginnings of Tim Hortons and how it was the hard work and dedication of the founders and the franchisees who created the brand &quot;Tim Hortons&quot;. Taking an idea that differentiates you from the rest, listening to your customers and workers, giving people more than they expect these are all the underlying ideas that pepper the first half of the book. Nothing too revolutionary or an example of marketing genius at work. The second half are a few memoirs or recollections of a couple of the &quot;True Life&quot; television commercials and the &quot;Roll Up to Win&quot; campaign. And also the Tim Hortons Foundation is thrown in afterwards. <br />All in all the book is the recollections of Ron Buist as the marketing director at Tim Hortons for over 25 years. When you look at the book and after you've read it that would seem obvious as to what it would be but its not quite sold that way, at least to me. I would have also liked to hear some insights given into what made the marketing work. How has the marketing and what marketing in particular has helped make Tim Hortons a Canadian staple. There wasn't a lot of that in here. Sort of like rolling up the rim of your coffee cup and seeing you won a timbit; it's something but not what you were really hoping for. Overall I give it a B- on the StuPage. Okay style but lacks a bit in substance.	2003-12-11

The book also puts it in Western context using Western military battles as examples. I liked the author's grouping of the teachings into principles and the examples that he gives. Also his chapter on Sun Tzu and terrorism gives the book a relevant feel. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get a grasp on the ides of the ideas of The Art of War, especially in a Western context. But I would also highly recommend reading through the translation of the original at the end of the book. I give this an A on the StuPage.	2003-11-10

The author is knowledgeable about the subjects she discusses and even puts emphasis on certain favorites of hers. The style and frankness are what set this book apart. If you get put off by the use of explicit language or what might be considered crude than you probably want another book. If you're looking for a walk on the wilder side of the bedroom than this is a good book to pick up. It discusses adult videos/books/etc. , bdsm for beginners, role-play, anatomy, anal play for him and her, and female ejaculation. Down and dirty indeed.

Sano is back home and getting married. Of course as soon as he is married he is called to investigate the death of one of the Shogun's concubines. I like this story. Rowland expands the characters of Sano and his sidekick Hirata, she also adds the character of Reiko as his non-submissive, untraditional wife. The addition of other characters in Sano's inner circle and adding depth to them adds to the story. The same adding of characters also threatens to take away from the overall series because along with Reiko other characters are also added. You can see the possibility of having too many characters coming into a story and making it more confusing or convoluted. But for this book it works. I give it a B on the StuPage.	2003-09-20

Hill doesn't go for the bigger &quot;mega-trends&quot; but takes those and picks out smaller more manageable, personal trends. Some of these in no particular order are: interconnectedness, Peter Pan-ism and mercenary management. For each trend he gives the factors and factoids, implications and the opportunity. This gives you what he thinks are what the facts are, what it means and how you can use it. This gives the book a usefulness that is good. The problem I have is that I see some of the trends as not that useful or groundbreaking. Some of them also have a duh factor. As in duh tell me something I don't know. I suppose with 60 trends this is inevitable and it does give the book a something for everybody quality. Overall I give the book a B-. A useful first step if you want to see what might be coming next but I wouldn't bet the farm on anything in this book by itself.	2003-08-24

This one launches everything to the next level. Relationships are moved forward, members are added, the mission is expanded and more pressure is put on the &quot;family&quot;.

It follows his growth into his new /old setting of Buck Keep and its intrigues and introduces what will be the quest for the next book. Hobbs is very comfortable with the character of Fitz as well as those from the earlier book and she uses that comfort level to move the characters from one point to another both in the plot and in their growth as a character. The only fault I could give is that for a second book it doesn't go very far. This is more because of it being an intro to the quest and following the growth of the characters rather than the second book in a larger story. I give it a B+ on the StuPage.	2003-06-07

McNamara uses his personal experiences especially during the Kennedy and Vietnam era as an argument for a lot of his arguments. While these serve to give a first hand view of the problems they add little to the arguments presented. The problem lies not as much with the overly idealistic and optimistic desires of the authors but with the lack of any constructive method to reach those ideals. The fact that you want peace and think that if everybody else would commit to wanting peace too then that would solve the problem does not make for a serious discussion of how to bring peace about. In the beginning of the book McNamara says the ideas presented are to spark discussion and debate to bring about a change for a more peaceful world. I don't know if this book adds much to the discussion other than an idealistic desire. I give the book a C- on the StuPage Book Reviews.	2003-06-07

There is a strong focus on developing characters even though the book title implies it would be plot. The author tends to jump from using techniques that you might use before even starting to write to something you might use after you've finished and are editing to something you'd use to move along as you're writing.

For most of the book it is Bek keeping the Morgawr away from his sister, the Ilse Witch. Meanwhile the island iss breaking down and the heroes are running out of time. The main characters also have to deal with their personal demons/fears/hang-ups whatever. This appears to be the secondary plot and them of the book.

The consultant then goes in and does his thing. A few months later after the consultant's changes have had time to settle, get the edges off, etc. you go 'he had some pretty good ideas' I'm glad we hired him. That's sort of how this book is. In the beginning the author starts off explaining his theory and ideas and you kind of go \\"ummm yeah okay\\". Then he starts to put it into practice and you go \\"okay I see using part of that and some of this would work for my business\\" and at the end he brings it all together and half the stuff he said in the beginning was semi-useless, but you can see why he said it, and it comes together and you say \\"I can see how this would improve things\\".

It is also like the first book in that more characters are added to the &quot;family&quot; (thus the title: Family Tree). The adding of the members is a major sub-plot to the book. <br />I would have liked if there had been more of the ghost conflict or some other conflict. The beginning conflict with the other group was a a fan something I didn't like (I'm a big softie when it comes to character's I like and conflict) but as a reader it was good in that it added drama and tension. The resolution of that conflict was good as a fan but as a reader it was almost too pat and nice. The ghost conflict was almost like a minor add on.

This is a book based on Taoist ideas on sexuality and sexual healing. That isn't so clearly stated on the cover but once you read a little way in it is very apparent. The authors don't try to hide it or deny the Taoist influences in fact they almost go out of their way to praise it. The book gives techniques on moving and using the 'energy' within your body to prolong orgasm, have multiple orgasms and sexual healing. They also advocate the male technique of non-ejaculatory orgasm. The techniques can be useful especially as part of a sexual repertoire though I don't go into the whole Taoist belief and spiritual side as the authors. Overall I give the book a B.

The build up to where any part of the action takes place takes most of the book, which is surprising seeing as the first chapter is from a part that doesn't happen till 3/4 of the book. Why McKiernan decided to do that is beyond me. He only breaks the chronology of the book for that one chapter.

The characters were too flat for the story. Parts of the story were too easily solved or dismissed.  And the book tries to be too many stories in one. Is it a story of betrayal between brothers? Not when one brother disappears for a quarter of the book and the main character shifts from one of the brothers to someone else not involved and SPOILER one of the brothers goes mad, not from being betrayed but because he kills a man. Or is it a story of a story of a place of magic and &quot;disabled monsters&quot; against a mad king and his brutal general? If so then what's with the first half to two-thirds of the book. Etc. etc. <br />The theme was too heavy for the characters. Betrayal and jealousy enough to drive men mad require more than paper thin characters and more time and interaction between those characters than occurred. If the author had stuck with one major theme or more time developing and resolving each theme and character this could have been a good book. Or if he had taken a lighter touch and let it be a straight fantasy adventure it could have worked too. He didn't so I give this book a D.	2002-05-24

Austen takes the story of two sisters, one quick to emotion and the other reasonable nearly to a fault and puts them in a similar situation of unreturned fancy. In the right hands this could be an interesting story and you would think Austen would make it so. Unfortunately not, her story is dull and I kept waiting for something to happen.

I enjoyed the ending. It wrapped up what was going on effectively and more than most it is a satisfying ending that doesn't leave you wondering what happens to the characters yet does let the characters continue on in their universe just as in the real world. <BR>   My advice for anyone who hasn't read this series is to read the first book and the last one and skip the middle two. You won't miss much and it's all pretty much covered in the synopsis at the front of the last book anyway.	2001-11-18

I'm surprised because usually I'm not a big fan of &quot;straight&quot; fiction. This is a story of a boy and his father, the competition between two fly-fishers and two families. The telling is written well with all the main plot of the competition for 'Trout King' tied in well with the subplots of a boy and his love and loss of love for fishing and the strains of two families. Pickhardt writes well and is at ease with the<BR>story he's telling. I give this book an A. Not a favorite or highly recommended but it does it's job, to tell the story, and it does it well.	2001-10-21

Gerrold takes you behind the writing of the words to the building of worlds and people that make a story come alive. You<BR>learn to think of your writing as more than the telling of events into creating an experience in a different place and time. He gives you writing from a writers perspective and with a<BR>real respect and love for the genres of science fiction and fantasy. I give this an A+.	2001-10-21

The writing and plot are pretty average and there aren't too many big surprises even though the book is set up as a sort of mystery of what's in the package. We follow the central character Glenn as he goes about trying to deliver the package. Some weird sci-fi stuff happens in the process and sets up the ending.	2001-08-21

Books	5	1	2	N	N	More than just going online or adding more computers	The book is about going digital and not just adding more computers or going on-line but creating a whole digital business design for your company. It takes a look at how several business in different areas have gone digital and at different stages in the digital design of several business. I like that it doesn't preach that everything will work for everybody the same way and it stresses creating a good basic business design as the foundation for creating a good digital design. It sparks ideas and guidelines more than a cookbook approach. Good for the large IBM's to the storefront from dot.coms to mom and pops.	2001-08-21

Yet it gives the necessities and analysis of war.     It's got alot of information, which the average reader may find more information than they need or want to know. Yet the readability is good.

Like reading a history book from the dark ages where sorcery and dragons actually exists.  The treachery and deceit and politics could have come from any history book.  The characters with their flaws and ambitions and mistakes could be the former rulers of any land of today.  Martin gets it right with this novel.  Very long but worth it and necessary for all that there is to tell.	2001-02-05
