I was interested to read this memoir of his life and struggles on his family farm growing up.  Threads of his experiences were familiar to me because they have flowed into his stories and have enriched them.   <br /> <br />The section of the book \\"Straightening the Hammermill\\" is one every father and son should read.  What a powerful statement about the strength and ties of family and community and the knowledge passed between fathers and sons.   <br /> <br />The world gained a writer but a family farm was lost.  Meyers honored that passing.	2005-10-07

They are filled with short \\"simple\\" poems that will stop you in your tracks.   <br /> <br />The section of this book entitled \\"Sabbaths\\" contains poems written on Sundays from 1998-2004.  Until 2003, these poems are about love, long term love; aging,the joys and sorrows; and love and connection with the land.  In 2003, Berry gets angry and his poems are filled with sorrow and horror about the war. <br /> <br />From VII <br />\\"When they cannot speak freely in defiance <br />of wealth self-elected to righteousness, <br />let the arts of pleasure and beauty cease. <br />Let every poet and singer of joy be dumb. <br />When those in power by owning all the words <br />have made them mean nothing, let silence <br />speak for us.  When freedom's light goes out, let color <br />drain from all paintings into gray puddles <br />on the museum floor.  When every ear awaits only <br />the knock on the door in the dark midnight, <br />let all the orchestras sound just one long note of woe.  <br /> <br />No matter if you read Berry's fiction, essays or poetry, your life will be enriched.	2005-10-07

No one's family could be as bad as this one, at least not every day, and yet you can feel the love that underpins it all.  The lesson to be learned is to go hide out in the flower cooler, soak in the beauty, take a deep breath and head back into the fray. <br /> <br />Jeanne Ray has a unique ability to capture family life in all it's glory.  Enjoy.	2005-09-21

Smithy Ide travels across the country on his bike on a quest, shedding pounds and spreading the essence of his presence as he goes. \\"Hook's here\\", is what he would tell his sister when she was lost and he would find her and his presence would quiet the voices that overcame her.   <br /> <br />Smithy constantly gets into situations due to misperceptions about him usually when he is trying to help someone out.  Many of the mishaps have a touch of humor due to the craziness of human nature and the tendency to follow first impressions.  Again Smithy's presence shows through and he survives to continue his journey. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the many characters in this book and they were fleshed out in a few words as people that felt real.  I was sorry the book ended, I wanted to travel further with Hook.	2005-09-13

She gets to the center of things, she made me laugh, ache, smile with recognition, and say many times, \\"You've got that right\\" about her comments about the current administration. <br /> <br />Every person trying to raise a child should read the section titled adolescence.  Every bride's maid would profit from reading flower girl.

Reading this book helped me move the events of 9/11 away from the still unthinkable horror to the effect that day had on the lives of real people as they first made their way through the ash and dust on the street and through the days beyond that. <br /> <br />I loved the strength of Jack's love for Renata.  I liked that he fell for her before he learned her many layered aches from the past and stayed with her ready to move through and beyond to their days beyond that. <br /> <br />I liked how the characters were able to rise to the occasion when they needed do, including Renata's mother who loved her enough to reject her offered fantasy and demand that her daughter live her life and overcome her losses in the days beyond that.	2005-08-27

Allende is one of my must reads and I always eagerly await her next work.  To my delight I found the book was great fun to read and watch as my perception of a TV hero was thrown out the window and he was turned into a fallible flesh and blood man.  The characters burst with free will to make their own decisions and were rarely constrained by expected role playing behavior. <br /> <br />This book was wonderful to escape into and I enjoyed the swashbuckling fun.	2005-08-16

These book covers topics from nature to war to using your feet to walk out of a sleasy show. My favorite single poem was the one entitled Watching Sandhill Cranes. This book is a collection of four volumes of poetry.  My favorite section was the last, The Methow River Poems.  These were written for the U.S. Forest Service and displayed along a wilderness road.  I loved the idea of hikers coming upon a poem which grabs their attention for a moment and then re-focuses it again in a new light on the beauty around them.	2005-08-08

Books	5	4	6	N	N	Listen to the children	This is the first book I have read by Ann-Marie MacDonald and it was a gripper.  It is not so much a suspense story of what will happen as it is when will the adults finally find out about what goes on after 3 in their daughters' classroom.  It is upsetting to understand that parents, even attentive good parents, won't necessarily discover that their child is being abused. <br /> <br />This is the kind of novel that I found myself telling people about  as I was reading it.  From the ethics of using Nazi scientists to build the space program, to the rush to judgement in crime investigations, to the relationships of husbands and wives; discussions could range far and wide in the context of this book.  I was unsettled the whole time I was reading it and this is not a book I will soon forget.	2005-08-04

That was a clue to me that the characters would not be memorable or distinctive.  That turned out to be true, but this book is extremely powerful because of how the characters are used to shine a light on the complexity of modern Africa and Sudan. <br /> <br />Caputo wants us to care about Africa but he knows to do that he has to get past the glassy eyed stare many Americans have due to little knowledge of the on the ground situation and the lack of media attention.  As stated in the movie Hotel Rowanda, \\"Nobody cares about Africa.\\". <br /> <br />For me, Caputo accomplished his purpose.  My eye stops when I come across an article about Sudan.  I am able to read that article with much more of an understanding of the forces in play.     <br /> <br />As we know, the war has ended in Sudan, but the killing goes on in Darfur and enormous problems remain in all their complexity. <br /> <br />\\"He would need to keep his rule of thumb in mind: people did the right thing only when the wrong thing failed to present itself.

This book was a page turner but I probably wouldn't have read it if it had been written by another author.  It was too dark, too connected with the awfulness in today's news for my normal taste in reading.  For a story, it probably should be rated higher than a 3, but as an old Nevada Barr fan that is all I gave it.  This author seems to have moved to a new direction in her writing, so her fans will either have to adjust or re-read her previous books. <br /> <br />As in High Country, I learned very little about the National Park setting and the wonder of sitting alone in the wilderness was jarred a bit with this story of human fraility.	2005-07-11

It is not the typical wilderness adventure book.  Unlike the TV nature show, amazing things don't happen every few mintutes.  In fact few amazing things happen at all, yet the whole experience of small wilderness experiences add up to a book that will take you to another place.   <br /> <br />\\"It seems critical to me to devote some part of each year to this nothingness, this time without time, this confrontation with animal demons real and imagined, learning once again how to surrender to some internal environment made external.\\" <br /> <br />Nollman confronts the question of us versus them strongly in this book with the us being modern society and them being animals, nature and native cultures.  He feels the chance has been lost to learn from \\"them\\" in a way that everyone would benefit, instead of disregarding that knowledge and destroying it. <br /> <br />Chapter 15 begins with a wonderful quote by Carl Safina from Song for the Blue Ocean.  \\"Ecosystems are now like history books with many of the pages ripped out.  And when people come along there is no way for them to know what was on those torn-out pages.  Their values are not constructed around the abundance that once filled those holes.  They accept the blank parts as though they've always been there.\\" <br /> <br />Nollman pulls no punches in what he experiences on this trip including describing the constant difficult and loving give and take among the three soujourners. <br /> <br />This is a strong book and well worth the time to read it.	2005-07-05

What a writer!  His works are as emotionally jarring as those by Chuck Palahniuk without all the violence and the craziness.  This is a book of short stories and each one packs a wallop. <br /> <br />One of my favorites was \\"Abiding by Law\\" which speaks to the universality of human emotions, our fear of the unknown and love for the safe and familiar, the strong drive to protect those in our family.  This story has a wonderful aha moment, when a man's protective shell is cracked by a smile and a bow, a gentle nudge from one of those amazing people who are able to form bridges between people, and he is able to reach out a helping hand to his neighbor. <br /> <br />In \\"Making the News\\" a farmer creates sculptures out of cars. <br />\\"We were in the grove.  Mammouths Resurrected come into view.  Ed'd turned three cars into mammoths, put thick legs and trunks on them, and tusks,and he'd half-buried one so it looked like it was climbing out of the earth, and the second one was leaping like it'd just shook free, and the third was in full run, its trunk raised.  From a distance they really did look like mammoths.  The rock pile of all the rocks Ed's father and Ed and Gray had picked out of the fields was in the center of the group, and second mammoth looked like she was leaping over it, her front legs curled up for the leap. <br /> <br />'I don't see how he does it,' Paul Alcorn said. 'Everywhere you turn, there's something new.' <br /> <br />We stood looking at the sculpture, the wind making light scatter through the trees. <br /> <br />'It's like he's trying to bring it all back,' Paul Alcorn said.  'That's what it feels like.  Everything that ever happened here. <br />Everything that's lost, he's trying to retrieve it.'\\"	2005-06-29

There are villains and heroes, all flawed and all lovable to varying degrees.  I enjoyed the bizarre turn of events that happened all because Palmer Stoat, an amoral lobbyist, was an incorrigible litter bug. <br /> <br />Sick Puppy carries a message about government, and life in general, which flies high and clear on the strength of Hiassen's sense of humor and excellent writing.  Most people will think twice about throwing something out of a car window after reading this book and maybe will think twice about a lot of other things too.	2005-06-27

It is the part that often gets left behind in the dot-dot-dots of quotations:'No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality.  The worlds in which different socities live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached.'\\"  <br /> <br />\\"I write stories because I have questions about life,not answers.  I believe life is mysterious and not dissectable.  I think human nature is best described in even a long-winded story and not in a psychoanalytical diagnosis.  I write because often I can't express myself any other way, and I think I'll implode if I don't find the words.  I can't paraphrase or give succinct morals about love and hope, pain and loss.  I have to use a mental longhand, ponder and work it out in the form of a story that is revised again and again, twenty times, a hundred times, until it feels true. <br /> <br />I write for very much the same reasons that I read: to startle my mind, to churn my heart, to tingle my spine, to knock the blinders off my eyes and allow me to see beyond the pale.  Fiction is an intimate companion and confidant for life.\\"  <br /> <br />As other reviewers have said, there is a fair amount of repetition of events in this book, but that is counter-balanced by the excellent writing and often new takes on the same story.  By the end of the book, I was hoping that Amy Tan will again soon startle our minds with more fiction.	2005-06-20

There are a fair number of strands running through this short book which all get tied up in the end.  There are some new characters and some old ones reappear.

I had read his stories of Port William.  I was led to this book of poetry by a poem's mention in the Afterword in William Greider's \\"The Soul of Capitalism\\".  In the latest issue of \\"The Land Report\\", Wes Jackson quotes from a letter from Wendell Berry that 22 years later led to a conference titled \\"Toward an Ignorance-Based Worldview\\". <br /> <br />Some of the poems in this book describe the wonder of and need to fight for true everyday love.  They are some of the most moving love poems I have ever read.  Many talk about the land and the continuity of its people and history that comprise a place and community.  No one speaks better on this topic. <br /> <br />Then there are the Mad Farmer Liberation Front poems.  Read this one and head out in a new direction. <br /> <br />Manifesto:The Mad Farmer Liberation Front <br /> <br />Love the quick profit, the annual raise, <br />vacation with pay.  Want more <br />of everything ready-made.  Be afraid, <br />to know your neighbors and to die. <br />And you will have a window in your head. <br />Not even your future will be a mystery  <br />any more.  Your mind will be punched in a card <br />and shut away in a little drawer. <br />When they want you to buy something <br />they will call you.  When they want you <br />to die for profit they will let you know. <br />So, friends, every day do something <br />that won't compute.  Love the Lord. <br />Love the world.  Work for nothing. <br />Take all that you have and be poor. <br />Love someone who does not deserve it. <br />Denounce the government and embrace  <br />the flag.  Hope to live in that free <br />republic for which it stands. <br />Give your approval to all you cannot  <br />understand.  Praise ignorance, for what man <br />has not encountered he has not destroyed. <br />Ask the questions that have no answers. <br />Invest in the millennium.  Plant sequoias. <br />Say that your main crop is the forest<br />that you did not plant, <br />that you will not live to harvest. <br />Say that the leaves are harvested <br />when they have rotted into the mold. <br />Call that profit.  Prophesy such returns. <br />Put your faith in the two inches of humus <br />that will build under the trees <br />every thousand years. <br />Listen to carrion-put your ear <br />close, and hear the faint chattering <br />of the songs that are to come. <br />Expect the end of the world.  Laugh. <br />Laughter is immeasurable.  Be joyful  <br />though you have considered all the facts. <br />So long as women do not go cheap <br />for power, please women more than men. <br />Ask yourself; Will this satisfy <br />a woman satisfied to bear a child? <br />Wil this disturb the sleep <br />of a woman near to giving birth? <br />Go with your love to the fields. <br />Lie easy in the shade.  Rest your head <br />in her lap.  Swear allegiance <br />to what is nighest your thoughts. <br />As soon as the generals and the politicos <br />can predict the motions of your mind, <br />lose it.  Leave it as a sign <br />to mark the false trail,. the way  <br />you didn't go.  Be like the fox <br />who makes more tracks than necessary, <br />some in the wrong direction. <br />Practice resurrection. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-05-17

I do not expect my prose to blow away their caution and skepticism.  but I do hope they keep their minds open to the possibility that some of what I have observed may be right and that it speaks to their own experiences and thinking.  If so, they need to ask some questions, to entertain more doubts about the system, less doubt about themselves.  Curiosity and doubt are the first steps toward action, especially when accompanied by well-earned anger at the way things are.\\" <br /> <br />This book is thought provoking and full of ideas yet is easy to read and stick with.  Greider puts forth the concept of pension funds as the \\"universal owner\\" of major corporations and thus a possible force to enact changes.  He explains how Innovest, a financial advisory firm applies \\"Eco-Value\\" ratings to corporations, thus giving investors a tool for positive screening. <br /> <br />I learned that the Nature Conservancy is starting a Center for Compatible Economics which is \\"trying to create jobs and incomes in order to protect nature\\".  Greider lays out the problems of capitalism and government as he sees them and gives examples of how these problems are being tackled from the bottom up, one person at a time.  He encourages us all to step up and contribute to that effort.  <br /> <br />This book is well documented, using sources such as Wendell Berry and Paul Hawken and many others.	2005-05-09

The program was very moving and we were honored to hear Robert speak about his experiences and feelings and struggles.   <br /> <br />In addition, I viewed an exhibit of the photographs at a local retirement center. <br /> <br />There were about 15 large photographs displayed in an beautiful empty room.  I was the only one present as I walked among the pictures and read the commentary.  The photographs were beautiful, the book can't do justice to their elegance and the way they honored these young men.  <br /> <br />I have been reading about one soldier a day in the book so I can more fully experience the photographs and the words they say. <br /> <br />Nina said she felt no attention was being paid to the wounded soldiers and she wanted to so something about that.

He clearly loved the beauty of the land of Africa and its people, yet he was continually frustrated and angered by both.  He treated his workers extremely well, loaned them money, helped with education, yet he also beat them.   <br /> <br />Gore-Browne was ahead of his time in understanding that the white man should and could not be the rulers of Africa, that the governments should be run by the native people. He spent much of his life trying to achieve that goal.  As others have said, it is a wonder that his name is not well known.  Christina Lamb shone light on a story that should be told.	2005-04-08

The book makes the reader laugh but also feel great sympathy and sadness; also a lot of worry about Lorelei. <br /> <br />Actually the relationship of Paul and Lexy reminds me of the new sit com, Committed.

Every time the sun appeared, I heard what sounded like shots ringing out from the trees overhead.  The sun was warming up the seed pods, which explosively propelled the walnut-sized seeds as far as thirty feet off. \\" <br /> <br />\\"Francis Putz, a botanist who has studied lianas in Panama, has suggested that it may be advantageous for trees to sway out of phase from their neighbors because this would tend to snap vine connections.  Swaying out of phase is best accomplished by evolving different architectures, which in turn result in different flexibilies.  The need for out-of-phase swaying might thus promote an increase in diversity of rain forest trees..... <br /> <br />There is an alternative to swaying.  If swaying fails to shed hangers-on, a tree can prune itself, sending a liana tumbling down into obscurity at little cost to itself by dropping branches and entangled leaves, particularly if these branches and leaves are shaded.\\"	2005-03-20

Except on sources like \\"Democracy Now\\", those authentic voices seem to be missing in the media's telling of the stories of today.  I think therefore this book is important for what it tells us about the history of race relations in this country but also for what it can tell us about our decisions and view of present reality.  <br /> <br />I live in Madison, Wisconsin and this quote from \\"Blood done Sign My Name\\" is sometimes pretty applicable today in my town.  \\"Black Southerners forcibly altered that narrative in the 1950's and 1960's by stepping outside their assigned roles - and compelling a reluctant federal government to intercede on their behalf.  As often as not, they had to be prepared to defend themselves physically from terrorism by white reactionaries.  White liberals, with their hesitancy and quibbling, were sometimes very little help.  In North Carolina, white liberal paternalists did not stand in the schoolhouse door as George Wallace had in Alabama.  Instead, journalist Osha Gray Davidson observes,they 'would quietly appoint a committee to deliberate for eternity over exactly which door, and of what dimensions, would best facilitate the ingress and egress of all students.  The style of a Wallace was different, but the result was the same.'  And so sometimes it was necessary to escape from an endless and pointless conversation with white paternalism by striking hard and sometimes violently against the architecture of their oppression-Oxford's tobacco warehouses being only the local example.\\" <br /> <br />Timothy Tyson delves into his personal history with an open mind and eye to find the truth about his family and his town during a difficult time and era.  But he is also making the point that times are still difficult and the way to work on problems is to face them head on with a knowledge of what came before. <br /> <br />\\"There it should stay, many people seem to think - why dredge this stuff up?  Why linger on the past, which we cannot change?  We must move toward a brighter future and leave all that horror behind.  It's true that we must make a new world.  But we can't make it out of whole cloth.  We have to weave the future from the fabric of the past, from the patterns of aspiration and belonging - broken dreams and anguished rejections - that have made us.  What the advocates of our dangerous and deepening social amnesia don't understand is how deeply the past holds the future in its grip - even, and perhaps especially, when it remains unacknowledged.  We are runaway slaves from our own past, and only by turning to face the hounds can we find our freedom beyond them.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-31

I discovered it way too late and now Bill Moyers is gone and the show is only 1/2 hour.  David B. is doing a good job, but apparently even had to find a new sponsor.  Hopefully he can hold down the fort for a long time. <br /> <br />But at least Bill Moyer's words are available in this book.  As was evident in the discussions on \\"Now\\", Moyers is not afraid to let his humaness shine through with all the struggles to follow the path of an ethical life.  I loved the chapter on Lyndon Johnson, the goal to give everyone a hand up is a shining light compared to the everyone for himself tenor of today.  Moyers lays out the success and failures of the Johnson years, but I came away feeling good that a president got into office and started out wanting to do what would be good for all the people in the country:to make a fresh start and say what are the highest goals we can reach for. <br /> <br />The last section of the book is on aging.  Wise words here too.  I hope as he ages Bill Moyers keeps writing and producing programs filled with his common sense and wisdom. <br /> <br />Thank you Mr. Moyers for all your work and keep on keeping on.	2005-01-29

I came across this book at a cross country ski resort in Northern Vermont with pure white snow and starkly blue skies.  The setting could not have been more in juxtaposition to the setting of this novel.  In between ski runs, I finished the book in a day and 1/2.  I found the ideas fascinating. <br /> <br />With Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy coming to the movies, one does begin again to wonder who is serving whose purpose.  In this story, people are heading down the same path, using the same information for extremely different reasons.  Greed seems to be the one that wins out in the end but there always are a few survivors, at least that is how I chose to extrapolate from the open ended conclusion of the book. <br /> <br />Interesting book to read by the fire and think about on the ski trails. <br /> <br />	2005-01-28

I try to listen to \\"Democracy Now\\" 4 days a week on the radio or watch on public access TV.  It takes a bit of courage to listen because Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzalez can be counted on to tell the story that hasn't been told about people who have no voice and that can shake up my soul. <br /> <br />The \\"Exception to the Rulers\\" is most critical of the media, both written and over the airwaves and how they are all in the power and access game and play by the rules.  Goodman, however, is fearless and takes advantage of any opportunity to stop power in its tracks with the deer in the headlights look and possibly answer a real question while their guard is down. <br /> <br />I learned to enjoy the anticipation of what Amy Goodman would ask as she described being handed opportunites to question Bill Clinton over the phone and appear on the Sally Jesse Raphael Show.   <br /> <br />If you have noticed you haven't heard \\"Imagine\\" or \\"Peace Train\\" or \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" on Clear Channel radio stations lately, there is a reason. (150 songs) <br /> <br />\\"Shortly after 9/11, filmmaker Michael Moore wrote about an e-mail he had received from a radio station manager in Michigan.  The manager forwarded Moore a confidential memo from the radio conglomerate that owns his station: Clear Channel.  'The company, Moore wrote,'has ordered its stations not to play a list of 150 songs during this national emergency..... <br /> <br />Rah-rah war songs, though, are OK.\\"... \\"And then there was this troubling instruction: No songs by Rage Against the Machine should be aired.  The entire works of a band are banned?  Is this the freedom we fight for?  Or does this sound like one of those repressive dictatorships we are told is our new enemy?'\\"  <br /> <br />That is just music, there is so much more we are not allowed to hear or see as we head into another 4 years.  Shake off the fog and listen to, watch and read Amy Goodman as she uncovers the lies of the rulers and gives voice to thepeople.	2005-01-16

The endless demands of Lucy were not.  I have enjoyed Ann Patchett's novels, but this book just made me irritated at how invasive she let the relationship with Lucy become.  I admired the circle of people who tried to support Lucy and stood by her, I just didn't understand how they could keep doing it.  I don't mean to criticize, it's just that I had trouble seeing Lucy as a sympathetic character.  I realize she suffered terribly due to her medical conditions but there has to be a limit to anyone's behavior.  Lucy was actually only hurting herself but so many other people were constantly drawn into propping her up.  I just didn't find it uplifting or inspiring or all that interesting to read about their struggle.	2005-01-07

The story details their struggle with their mother but their true touchstone in life and anchor is each other. <br /> <br />I also related to the mother's, Marion, struggle.  The call of breaking free of whatever cages we surround ourselves with is tempting but the price paid once the cage is escaped can be very very high.  In this case, Marion had no access to the key to climb back in a newly expanded cage and was left on the outside looking in. <br /> <br />\\"And I did not want to understand my mother.  If I understood her, I might have to forgive her.  And at some critical time I became very much invested in not forgiving her-we all did.  It became an underpinning in our reduced family, a need, even; just as there seems to be a terrible need for family feuds to continue.  In a way, it is as if your refusal to forgive is too much a part of you for you to lose it.  Who would you be without it? Not yourself.  Lost, somehow.  Thinkk of how people tend to pick the same chair to sit in over and over again.  We are always trying to make sure we know where we are.  Though we may long for adventure, we also cherish the familiar.  We just do.\\"	2005-01-03

This novel cuts to the quick of human interactions with each other and the world around.  Recently,after having a discussion with a friend, I picked up the book to continue reading and the words I read directly related to the heart of the issue we were struggling with. <br /> <br />Read the words of a mother,Marie, about her son, Carson. \\"She knew he wouldn't tell her. No sense pursing it.  If she had guesses, they would have to remain that way.  Guesses and wonders-sometimes it seemed that was what her relationship with her son was.  More wonder, perhaps, than guess. But both.\\" <br /> <br />This is a story of the West, horses, love, friendship, alliances, loyalty, family, recognition of good, and stars. <br /> <br />\\"But Earl felt something shaping itself on this hillside, far different from anything suggested here, from anything written in the way the three of them stood.  He looked at the Great Bear, its legs loping through half the heavens, and he wondered: If he and Willi and Carson were a constellation the Bear looked down upon, what would it form? What was it forming? And the horses, too? <br /> <br />But he didn't know, and it was too late if he did.  Stories in points of light.  If you looked at the skies in a Lakota way, you saw one set of stories, and if you looked at them in a European way, you saw another.  Yet the stars were the same.  And if you had no way to look , you saw nothing but stars.  Nothing connected.  Here they stood, the three of them, in their own constellations, but some new picture was being formed, was somehow already formed-if you had the way to look at it.\\"  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book.	2004-12-30

The story is told through Hannah Coulter's eyes as she looks back on her life in the arms of that community.   <br /> <br />People in Port William don't live in fear.  \\"It was getting on toward dark, but I could see the car well enough, and I didn't recognize it.  I hesitated a minute.  The country is full of strangers now, and you hear tales.  There are , no doubt about it, some people who would knock an old woman in the head more or less on speculation.  But I thought \\"What of it?\\" and went on out.\\" <br /> <br />Hannah's accounts of the two loves of her life and the deepness and fullness of that love are the best descriptions of mature, lasting love that I have ever read. <br /> <br />Hannah looks to the future of Port William with some sadness as the lines of generations  of farmers have been broken.  This is reflected in the paths chosen by her own children. <br /> <br />\\"But did we tell the stories right?  It was lovely, the telling and the listening, usually the last thing before bedtime.  But did we tell the stories in such a way as to suggest that we had needed a better chance or a better life or a better place than we had? <br /> <br />I don't know, but I have had to ask.  Suppose your stories, instead of mourning and rejoicing over the past, say that everything should have been different.  Suppose you encourage or even just allow your children to believe that their parents ought to have been different people, with a better chance, born in a better place.  Or suppose the stories you tell them allow them to believe, when they hear it from other people, that farming people are inferior and need to improve themselves by leaving the farm.  Doesn't that finally unmake everything that has been made?  Isn't that the loose thread that unravels the whole garment? <br /> <br />And how are you ever to know where the thread breaks, and when the tug begins?\\" <br /> <br />Wendell Berry's writing is a gift and I am deeply grateful.  <br /> <br />	2004-11-15

He is obviously trusted and respected by people who are willing to take risks so he can witness the effects of Saddam's rule and the war on the day to day life of those he interviews.   <br /> <br />I found the book fascinating and adding so much depth beyond the daily news.  What the news never relates is how warm and friendly the Iraqi people are even in the face of the current chaos in their country. It is striking and moving when Jon Lee consistently describes how the people he talks with separate the U.S. Government and military from him as an individual American reporter. <br /> <br />The reader is made aware that Iraq can't just be seen as \\"a country\\" but should be viewed as individual people whose lives are being profoundly effected every day in every way by the Coalition presence and the lack of security.  <br /> <br />Iraqis seem to see talking to Jon Lee Anderson as an opportunity to give their opinion about the occupation and state their frustrations and questions.  He in turn has, through the book, given their thoughts a voice that wouldn't be heard any other way.  I wish our leaders would listen to what they are saying.	2004-10-30

She remembered one incident in particular, when Mandy had gone somewhere that was not allowed - she couldn't remember now what hadn't been allowed - and lied about it, and then listened to her mother's lecture about lying, about how it was the lie rather than the dance club or the bar or the party under the bridge, with a tiny smile, as if honesty were a kitschy fad from her parents' generation, like spider plants or macrame.  And she thought now that it was as if Mandy had known, while she and Jeff were busy drawing up rules and lists of instructions, that this whole nonsensical era of unbelievable things was coming, and she was smiling at it, like a collaborator, over her mother's left shoulder.\\"<br /><br />This book is fun, lively and insightful.

It is like Dorothy Height was there behind the scenes connecting the dots of events and interweaving the people who were in the headlines.  She has the gift of knowing the importance of bringing people of all kinds together and the skill to accomplish it.  She never gave up when she was told not to do something because that is not how things have always been done or it is too risky. <br /> <br />I learned the term \\"Cotton Curtain\\"and about the bravery of a group of black and white women who conceived of and carried out the Wednesdays in Mississippi Project in 1964.  \\"The specific goals of the project were to establish lines of communication among women of goodwill across regional and racial lines, to observe the COFO student projects and discuss them with local Mississippi women, and to lend a \\"ministry of presence\\" as witnesses to encourage compassion and reconciliation.\\" <br /> <br />In talking with Fannie Lou Hamer, and knowing of the Heifer Project, Dorothy Height thought of the idea of setting up a pig bank in Mississippi.  That idea was turned into a program with the advice of an Iowa farmer and the assistance of the Prentiss Institute.  The National Council of Negro Women purchased 45 pigs.  \\"Participating families were trained to care for pigs, to establish cooperatives, and to work together to improve the community's nutrition and health.  Each participating family signed a \\"pig agreement\\", promising not to sell the pigs and to bring back two piglets from each litter to deposit in the bank.\\" <br /> <br />Dorothy Height has never stopped working on the problem of racism.  \\"Our young people ask why we have to keep trying to solve the problem of racism.  Other people move on to other problems, but if you're black, you don't have that option.  Your options are clear and limited:you either give up and go into drugs, or you work on racism for the rest of your life.  In our society every setp African Americans take is seen in political terms....\\" <br /> <br />The recounting of the huge effort to buy the present home of The National Centers for African American Women at 633 Pennsylvania Avenue is inspiring and again speaks to Dorothy Height's tenacity.  I am looking forward to visiting that building and the  Bethune Museum and Archives to pay respect and honor for a life so well lived.	2004-08-10

This book tore at my heart.  The powerlessness of a mother and father in the face of an unexplainable act by their oldest daughter, the solidarity of her sisters as they join their sibling at her corner every Saturday, the respecting of boundries set by Nora while offering her tools and gifts for her journey.  Reta, the mother, knew there is a battle still to be fought for the full recognition of women and she believed Nora was immobilized by that battle.  Reta came to realize that that was actually her personal battle with the world but didn't realize how deeply and totally it was also her daughter's.  <br />Shields description of the questions of children is magnificent.<BR>&quot;A child is suspended in a locked closet of unknowing, within the body's borders, that dark place.  To name a perplexity is to magnify it.  At the same time-I recognized the calumny for what it is-children's natural observations are often thought to be whimsical, even adorable, and their sayings, their mild queries, much quoted and smiled over, but there is no guarantee of an answer.  Whey do children risk disclosure at all?  It must be out of desperation or unsupportable fear.  It's a wonder they don't throw themselves out of windows in fits of confusion.&quot;	2004-07-07

I learned a little about life in a small town in India as 12 year old Seema learned about life in Iowa City.  <br />The importance of expanding the concept of friendship to include those who might be unfamiliar is woven throughout the book.  This makes this an important book for young people to read as they learn about Blue Jasmine, the math unit lakh, and the reason we don't wear dandelions in our hair.<br />My son went to school with the author's daughter and I want to extend my congratulations to Kashmira for writing such a warm and wonderful book.	2004-06-28

Yet is it filled with tiny action of the desert and the river.  I can hear the water flow over the river stones.  I can watch the raven wait.  <br />As usual, Barry Lopez's way with words takes your breath away but the words also stop the reader in his/her tracks as the full meaning of patience and watchfulness is displayed.  To stop and be immersed in a place is something few people in Western society take the time to do.  This book is a guide to what might await us if we dare to sit and watch with extraordinary patience.	2004-06-24

It offered a window into the everyday life of a family in Afghanistan as they try to cope with turbulent dangerous times.  Life  goes on, this is the time the people of Afghanistan have been given to live.  I learned a lot about the culture and family structure.  Asne Seierstad admits she was extremely angry about the treatment of women in the culture and it sounds like she let her feelings be known while she was there.  First and foremost though, I think it is important to try to learn about and understand the culture before judging it from a western viewpoint.  For me, this book provided one building block of that learning.	2004-06-22

The writing lets the reader see what Barry Lopez is seeing with so few precise words.  The gifts of wilderness are felt while reading sentences like, &quot;You could feel the creek vibrating in the silt and sand.&quot;.  The saddness comes from knowing these essays were written in the 1980's and so much more has been destroyed since then.<br />Due to when this book was written, there are a couple of references to former President Reagan's &quot;environmental record&quot;  written in real time.<br />There were so many essays that I loved, including the one speaking of traveling the river with Paul Winter.  I am going to quote a passage from &quot;Children in the Woods&quot;.<br />&quot;The quickest door to open in the woods for a child is the one that leads to the smallest room, by knowing the name each thing is called.  The door that leads to the cathedral is marked by a hesitancy to speak at all, rather to encourage by example a sharpness of the senses.  If one speaks it should only be to say, as well as one can, how wonderfully all this fits together, to indicate what a long, fierce peace can derive from this knowledge.&quot;	2004-06-15

This book made me very sad and angry about the past and what we as a people continue to do today.  How much we have destroyed and how much we have missed by always wanting to stick to who and  what we know and surround ourselves with possessions.<br />Each essay or poem is sharp and clear and vivid.

She is the center and no one ever considers that she might find it difficult or tiring to  be the calm in the center of the ever widening storm.  She is somehow able to pick herself up after whatever new twist is thrown at her and to be an anchor for the whole family tree.<br />This book is fun and smart and full of love of family, in all its forms.

The grace is the gift of the acknowledgement of independence or free will through a private bank account or a statement that &quot;you were right, I was mistaken&quot;.<br />This is a book about the delicate balance of loving and caring and meeting the needs of others while holding onto the core of freedom.

His thoughts are important for the national consciousness.<br />&quot;The other kind of freedom is the freedom to take care of ourselves and of each other.  The freedom of affluence opposes and contradicts the freedom of community life.&quot;<br />Berry advocates watching government closely, nationally but particularly locally.  When it comes time to protest, he calls for facts and good arguments, not just slogans and buttons. <BR>&quot;I would rather go before the governement with two people who have a competent understanding of an issue, and who therefore deserve a hearing, than with two thousand who are vaguely dissatisfied.&quot;<br />These essays span several decades but the ideas are more relevant today than when they were written.  The trends and programs, such as GATT and the loss of topsoil and the rise of megafarms, are as bad as he feared but time has proven them even more destructive.<br />&quot;Restraint - for us, now - above all:the ability to accept and live within limits; to resist changes that are merely novel or fashionable; to resist greed and pride; to resist the temptation to 'solve' problems by ignoring them, accepting them as 'tradeoffs', or bequesthing them to posterity.  A good solution, then, must be in harmony with good character, cultural value, and moral law.&quot;	2004-05-02

They live their public lives but we are allowed to share the private lives and their attempts to live with and avoid pain.<br />As always Lynne Sharon Schwartz's writing shines.  Not a word is wasted.  My favorite story was Deadly Nightshade.  It is about a woman who breaks with the grandparents' warnings and dares to eat a &quot;poisonous&quot; tomato.  &quot;Nothing she did in later years came close to the elation of that single act of abandon.  She was a daring woman who found no more opportunities for daring, or for the kind of daring peculiar to her, which was biting into the perilous unknown and letting it travel through her.&quot;<br />This was a short simple story which illustrates the book's theme of people living their lives wanting more of life but not being able to grab the brass ring for that second chance.<br />The stories will linger in your mind.	2004-04-27

Dr. Farmer works outside that parameter.  He doesn't expect to win.  &quot;We want to be on the winning team, but at the risk of turning our backs on the losers, no, it's not worth it.  So you fight the long defeat.&quot;   &quot;I don't care if we lose, I'm gonna try to do the right thing...And then all the victories are gravy, you know?&quot;<br />&quot;The best thing about Paul Farmer is those hikes.&quot; Dr. Paul Farmer walks four hours to do a home visit for one child.  He had already cured the child, but the child is part of a system, a family and home.  The system also has to be treated for the child to stay well.  &quot;You have to believe that small gestures matter, that they do add up.&quot;<br />That to me was the most amazing thing about this book.  Farmer travels the world raising money, speading the word of the need for treatment of drug resistant TB, setting up programs in other countries, yet he always comes back to the most important thing of treating one person at a time and improving their individual surroundings.<br />Farmer doesn't play by the rules, doesn't wait for approval or outside help, he works non-stop and is grateful when help arrives.  As other reviewers have suggested, contributions sent to Paul Farmer will be used for the nitty gritty, no high paid executives here.<br />As an aside, this book is interesting reading currently due to the recent events in Haiti.	2004-03-25

Anyone who watches TV today knows we are certainly headed in that direction with the dumbed down shows and news casts.  We are certainly not supposed to question authority.

Not citizenship of a country but citizenship of a place, a community, an ecosystem. <br />Berry writes that security comes from being self sufficient within that community.  The fact that a breakdown in transportation in this country would leave grocery stores bare should give us all pause.  How much more sense it would make to know the farms still exist locally to provide the food, to know the farmer through a Community Supported Agriculture arrangement, to not be dependent on food shipped across the country and even across the oceans.<br />The problem is current and past policies are driving small farmers out of business and local businesses are being driven out by megastores such as Walmart.  But Berry points out we can resist being driven along this path and stand up and say no. Join a CSA, shop at the farmer's market, buy organic, support the local shops.  <br />Wendell Berry says it better. &quot;This, of course, is the description of an emergency.  It is moreover an emergency of the worst kind:one that cannot be resolved by &quot;emergency measures&quot;.  It is an emergency that calls for patience, and to be patient in an emergency is a hard requirement.  but patience is what we must have if we hope to complete our work.<br />Obviously, we must use the emergency measures that are available to us, thought there are not many.  We must do what we can politically, thought our political power at present is not great.  But we must remember that good work cannot have a merely political completion.  Our work will not be completed in the world's capitals, but in healthful farms and forest, ecosystems and watersheds, and in coherent communities.  More important even than political victory for our side is the necessity to keep our thinking sound enough and complex enough to deal effectively with actual problems and needs.  We must not let either political urgency or our sense of peril reduceus to the proto-warfare of slogans and sound bites.&quot;	2004-03-16

As other reviewers have said, the storyline of High Country is good and holds the reader's interest until the end.  But I have some quibbles.  I have read most of Nevada Barr's books and always look forward to a new one coming out, partly because I like learning about the different parks.  I feel like I don't have much of a feel for Yosemite after reading this book, other than it tends to be very dark and dreary except for the rare times when the sun is shining.<br />Also I was surprised by the flowery language used in the beginning of the book.  Mostly the language is employed to describe the characters and set the stage.  For some reason I found the descriptions funny and a bit over the top.  It seemed to be a departure from Barr's previous writing.<br />Also, even though they were convenient for the plot, I found several of Anna's decisions to be unbelieveably careless.   In the other books, she seemed to have more sense about her.<br />It is hard to tell from the above, but I am fond of Anna and Nevada Barr's books and will continue to look forward to the next one.	2004-03-04

The sights and sounds in this book will stay with me a long time.<br />The story, Gorillas and Banana Beer, is a tale of hope in the face of no possible reason to hope, of a young man's discovery of a reason to live and give back when he found no life in our culture, of the bravery and strength and endurance of those who are trying to protect the children and gorillas.

I was a &quot;good&quot; student who went on to my class, but I stopped for a good while and marveled at how thick the air felt in the front of that building.  It was thick with the intensity of feelings and conviction.  There was no way to avoid a confrontation, the air was ready to explode.<br />David Maraniss describes the awakening of students like me on that day.  Looking back, the ongoing teach-ins, discussions, demonstrations and tear gas and the bombing of Sterling Hall, which woke my new husband and I up from several miles away, were the most valuable part of the education I received at the University of Wisconsin.  Today I stand up and say no with my vote and with my actions.<br />Maraniss says in the Epilogue, &quot;Connections are what fascinate me, the connections of history and of individual lives, the accidents, incidents, and intentions that rip people apart and sew them back together.&quot;  David not only wrote the book, but in doing so pulled the pieces together and created a safe place where the stories that had been untellable could be told.  He helped sew up some very old wounds and for that I thank him.<br />Maraniss re-awakens us to the horror of the Vietnam war and tells us how long lasting and far reaching that horror is.  In the Iraq war, that is still ongoing, we are shielded from these horrors.  We are again being deceived and are not being told the whole story.  Maraniss has opened up the story of Vietnam and the parallels to today are striking.  If only the lessons could be learned.<br />Other reviewers have mentioned how many players in the events of 1967 are public figures today.

Milton is in the old depot.  A marble column that held up the post office is part of another house nearby.  It is as if the residents of the disappearing town are hanging onto pieces of it, because that's what you have left when a community falls apart, pieces, and between all the pieces, you have the ghosts who knew the place when it was less rudimentary and more whole, who are eternally present, inhabiting the town's hollows like wind and weeds.

When he opens it, he sees in the doorway the powerful body, the cruel face, of The Tyrant.  The Tyrant asks, &quot;Will you submit?&quot;  The man does not reply.  He steps aside.  The Tyrant enters and establishes himself in the man's house.  The man serves him for years.  Then The Tyrant becomes sick from food poisoning. He dies.  The man wraps the body, opens the door, gets rid of the body, comes back to his house, closes the door behind him, and says, firmly, &quot;No.&quot;&quot;<br />This quote illustrates Zinn's contention that momentous changes can occur with patience and without submission.  Zinn points out that throughout history, the results of wars are not what were expected or planned, unpredicatable events occur.  Given that, the &quot;unacceptable means&quot; of war do not justify the &quot;uncertain ends&quot;.<br />This book was written in 1990 before the breakup of the Soviet Union and the end of apartheid although Zinn states the hope that such events will happen.<br />Although these milestones in history were yet to come, I was struck by the timeliness of the book, many sections could have been written about events and trends happening today. I recommend this book to everyone who feels swept away and powerless in America today.  Read this book and do not submit.	2003-06-13

The premise is very interesting and it led to several discussions amoung friends and family.  Somehow,however, I seemed to lose track of the characters, except for Sophie who was a child and easy to spot.  I think I was looking for more discussion from Todd of just how memory works. <br /> This book speaks to the power of love, especially when Bennie's mother was talking to him about the first time she saw him with Elizabeth,&quot;The two of you  were magic to each other.  You both swelled over with life.  You were radiant together.  I will never forget it.  I have tried to write about it and cannot find the words.  Your love was ancient, literary.  It was the way it was supposed to work.  You never believe such a thing is possible until you see it in real life.<BR>And I see it, that love, every time I look at Sophie.  She is a remarkable child.  And she would have to be, coming from such a blessed union.&quot;<br />The book also however, spoke to the loneliness of people and the barriers that make connecting so hard.

The book starts out ok but by the end it is clear that the story is never going to move to a deeper level.  I wanted to take a scissors and rip open the boxes the characters put themselves in and refused to break out of.

Delphine, she wanted people to say of her, she's awfully quick, but she's solid and reliable.\\"<br />The account of Eva and Delphine in the night garden drinking beer while they set the beer out to catch slugs is tender and funny and so full of life and death that it alone makes the book a treasure to read.<br />I checked this book out of the library but I am going to order it.

I was disappointed to find Allende did not carry her usual writing skills to this book.  The language was too simple.  Even in this age of superheroes, I found the feats of Alex and Kate unbelievable and the adults to be totally helpless and irresponsible.  Young adult books tend to give the kids the power but this was over the top.<br />I did enjoy being immersed however in the wonder and mystery of the Amazon and found the ability of the People of the Mist to disappear interesting since the Aborigines in \\"Mutunt Message Down Under\\" also are well versed in becoming invisible.  Allende is always a master at making the reader feel they are in the setting, seeing and hearing the sights and sounds.  The positive reviews I've seen seem to be by young adults, but they should know this book is by no means the best of Isabel Allende.	2003-03-15

I think he is a fascinating writer.  I laughed, I learned, I was outraged, I nodded my head in agreement.<br />Tony Kushner was quoted and an excerpt was read from \\"Homebody/Kabul\\" at a local Not in Our Name event.  His words and work resonate with the time.<br />Since I wrote the above review, I saw the play last night.  It is even more powerful on stage.  In the long Homebody monologue, it felt like the audience wanted to support Homebody, she seemed vulnerable alone on the stage for so long.  Her comments made the audience laugh, nod in agreement, and feel her sadness.<br />The tone changed in the second half of the play and the audience seemed wrung out at the end with all the emotions and ideas to ponder.  Whether read or watched, this play is exceedingly powerful.  I highly recommend both.	2003-03-13

Actually it is hard to imagine how he has survived this long, though he has had some scrapes along the way.  It is fascinating that in Cahill's view, the bravest thing he has done is &quot;appearing on one silly, unaired television show&quot;.<br />Tim Cahill is one of the modern day explorers who is documenting  the amazing diversity of cultures in this world and for that, this book is worth reading.	2003-02-17

Myla Goldberg explores the beauty and pain of insanity, Jewish mysticism,the magic of letters, family dynamics, the angst of trying to fit in, love and obligation, and yes the experience of participating in a spelling bee.  Amazingly the book holds together and keeps the reader's attention to the story.  After finding out what happens to the characters, the reader's mind is then free to explore the various components.  This book could lead to further exploration in a number of areas.  Goldberg is an exciting new author!	2003-02-11

I have always enjoyed the depth of Mr. Malone's characters but feel the characters in this book were soap opera like in a way.  I enjoyed reading the book, but felt it was less than I expected.	2003-01-30

The characters didn't engage me and the stereotypical degradation was overdone. Even though I was anxious to be done reading the book, I,like other reviewers, was stunned with the unfinished ending. I feel snookered by all the hype that went with the \\"long awaited\\" publication of this book.<br />This review is actually of the book, not the abridged audio CD.  Guess I entered it in the wrong place, sorry.	2003-01-20

It's a busy time but it is possible to feel like you are in charge.  Jeanne Ray's book illustrates that parents of adult children have it just as tough, big problems but no control over how the problems are solved.<br />The characters in this book, especially Woodrow, are warm, wise and loving.  They felt very real to me.  I enjoyed reading the dialogue as the family ties grew and bent to adapt to changing situations. The scene of the dancing sisters will stick in my mind for a long time.	2003-01-10

Her sentences soar yet the language is down to earth. <br />Henry's description of his mother's infidelity tells the story of all families and their struggles.  How family members can love and hate each other.  How they wonder how they could even be related but will defend each other against all foes.  I loved the different ways Beth Shaw could be and express herself depending on who she was with.  Jane Hamilton lets us in on the secret that our lives all have many pages waiting to be discovered.	2003-01-06

Working two jobs and still not being able to afford decent housing is inexcusable in this country which is overflowing with excess.  Barbara Ehrenreich's experiences were authentic for the time she worked the three jobs and provided a window to truths the &quot;powers that be &quot; choose to ignore.

What a wonderful depiction of the meeting and blending of two cultures, from each woman's decision to dare the unknown to the discoveries, wonder and learning that happened between the women and the Cheyenne every day.  Of course, the blending and learning and delight in learning of the \\"other\\" can only happen on a personal level.  The wider culture never seems to be able to accept and honor other ways of living.  May and Captain John Bourke tried to bridge that gulf.  Jim Fergus's description of their struggle alone makes the book worth reading.<BR>I highly recommend this book.	2002-12-17

Fertilizer which is laced with heavy metals that will end up in our food in increasing amounts as the accumulation in the soil increases.  Learn how the average citizen, small town mayor and farmer have zero ability to impact business practices which are supported by the government despite years of heroic effort and the expose of this book.

Lorrie Moore describes love and fear and joy in a way that is close to the bone and very real.  The stories Real Estate and People Like That... will stay with me for a long time.<br />I almost felt I should read the stories again to make sure I caught the puns and playfulness with words.

While I was reading \\"Body Toxic\\", I had a nagging recollection of another book and finally remembered John McPhee's book, \\"Pine Barrens\\" which was written in the 60's.  Read side by side, there would be a great difference in the two accounts of a now ravaged area.<br />I am not a reader of poetry and maybe that is why I found the prose of this book somewhat difficult to follow.  I didn't like the flow of words.  The words themselves however were another matter.<br />\\"People fought with violence: airplanes,sprays, chemicals.  They recruited with zeal. One of the recruitments was the Baby Boom, which my brother and my cousins and I belonged to, the plume of babies that followed the soldiers back from the second world war as if we'd been flushed from their wounds.  American men had gone ouerseas and lost limbs and seem themselves die and come back filled with a desire to make new humans.  For each of us boom children a soldier lay dead on a battlefield on another continent, and we corrected with our fat and harmless flesh what had been done to their bodies.  We are all substitutions.\\"<br />I finished this book wondering about Susanne Antonetta's health now.  I am worried about her and about all of us.	2002-11-25

Tim believed  that as he grew  older he would be allowed in on the real secrets of life.  Quinn's thesis however, is that Tim already was on the path to wisdom; and aging would have the opposite effect of stealing that widsom from him.<br />This book fascinated me and disturbed me.

It is about the joy of heading off in a new unexpected direction in life at any age and making cracks in the family and societal expectations and roles and life patterns that are hard to escape.  Quindlen again captures the complexities of families and the redemption of acknowledging the family truths that are known consciously or sub-consciously anyway.  Her writing places the reader at Blessing hearing the gurgling sounds and sharing the delights of watching the miracle of a baby growing.  There is right and wrong but it is often found in the most unlikely place or character.	2002-11-12

Here is an idea of the excellent writing to expect in her compilation.<br />I am going to quote the contribution by Olive Schreiner from South Africa.<BR>\\"There is, perhaps, no woman, whether she have borne children, or be merely a potential child-bearer, who could look down on a battlefield covered with the slain, but the thought would rise in her, \\"So many mothers' sons!  So many bodies brought into the world to lie there!  So many months of weariness and pain while bones and muscles were shaped within; . . .so many baby mouths drawing life at woman's breasts;-all this, that men might lie with glazed eyeballs and swollen bodies, and fixed, blue, unclosed mouths, and great limbs tossed-this, that an acre of ground might be manured with human flesh!\\"<br />In a besieged city, it might well happen tht men in the streets might seize upon statues and marble carvings from public buildings and galleries and hurl them in to stop the breaches made in their ramparts by the enemy...not valuing them more than if they had been paving stones.  But one man could not do this-the sculptor!  He, who, though there might be no work of his own chisel among them, yet knew what each of these works of art had cost, knew by experience the long years of struggle and study and the infinitude of toil which had gone to shaping of even one limb, to the carving of even one perfected outline, he could never so use them without thought of care...Men's bodies are our women's works of art.  Given to us power to control, we will never carelessly throw them in to fill up the gaps in human relationships made by international ambitions and greeds...<br />War will pass when intellectual culture and activity have made possible to the female an equal share in the governance of modern national life; it will probably not pass away much sooner; its extinction will not be delayed much longer.<br />It is especially in thedomain of war that we, the bearers of men's bodies, who supply its most valuable munition, who not amid the clamour and ardour of battle, but, singly, and alone, with a three-in-the-morning courage, shed blood and face death that the battle-field may have its food, a food more precious to us than our heart's blood; it is we especially, who in the domain of war,, have our word to say, a word no man can say for us.  It is our intention to enter into the domain of war and to labour there till in the course of generations we have extinguished it.\\"	2002-09-18

The readers of \\"The Birds of Heaven\\" should be prepared for joy, awe, geographic and naturalist education, but also sadness,fear and disgust. Matthiessen travels the world in search of the wild cranes. He is not just an observor, he is part of the effort to study and save these amazing birds. Robert Bateman's drawings are beautiful and serve as references as you read.<br />Peter Matthiessen travels with George Archibald, from the International Crane Foundation, through Asia revisiting places where cranes were previously abundant. They share the wonder of the many sightings of cranes. Yet Dr. Archibald is quoted as saying,\\"What a species we are!\\" after \\"being astonished anew by the destructive and murderous proclivities of man\\".<br />I learned so much from this book and recommend it to those who are not afraid to see the world as it is.	2002-07-02

The Letter to My Mother is sharp and shiny and wonderful.
