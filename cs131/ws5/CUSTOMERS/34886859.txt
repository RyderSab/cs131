I have enjoyed all her UN-books, Unchained, Unearthed, Unraveled and Unleashed.  Each book is totally stand alone and a super reads.    Barry is pure brilliance with one.  SHe pulls out all stops giving you first class space adventure, with one sexy hero, and oh, the children.  A beautiful book that haunts my heart long after I put it down.    If this isn't a RITA nominee next year I will eat my hat.    Barry sounds the bugler she is the Queen of outer-space romance!  And I cannot wait for the next Un-adventure.	2005-06-13

And I will be eager for it.<br />This is Jayne Anne at her best.

This is a more romantic, whimsical side of Stuart the Queen of the Bad Boys.  Those this bad boy is centuries bad, he has become rather jaded and it takes a trip to earth to make him care.  It's Stuart as we BEST.  This story alone is the price of the book!<br />I have not ready Cherry Adair, but shall after reading this story.  This blind date was such a fun read.  I really lover her characters and the whole story was such fun, so sexy.  Off to buy her back list!<br />The last story by Jensen is good, but not in the league with these first two.  First off, the premise is blind dates.  Her story is NOT a blind date.  The premise is contrives, but I went with that.  But it's not a date, they go in an plane write to keep her out of the way.  She thinks she is on a trip to pick up special linens.  Why have them in a plane?  Why have the go pick up linens.  The premise is so thin.  Secondly, the attraction between the leads had promise, but it's such not developed correctly.  Jensen is a talented writer and the story is good, but not great like the first two and hurt by it not fitting the premise of a blind date.<br />Jensen's a 4 start, I give it a 5 because of the strength of Stuart's and Adair's brilliance.	2004-06-17

I am a fan of all Nance's Children of the Greek Gods series, The Seeker being my absolutely fav.  I would leave my hubby for Hugh.  But that being, I think Nance really needs to go with this futuristic line.  This is her BEST book and if this does not when a RITA they don't know what is good!<br />This is an amazing book.  The second in the 2176 series, I have read book 1 by Grant and book 3 by Maverick.  Really looking forward to O'Shea's book when it comes out after reading her first book.  But Have a feeling you are looking at THE best book of the series.  First three has adventure, book one sort of suffered being the lead book and is basically a tale unfinished because book 5 will be the other half.<br />But Nance steps up to the plate and hits a home run.  Day is one great hero.  A by the book RCMP, yet is very much a woman under the cop.<br />Nance you did GOOD!!	2004-06-17

She shines best when she can fly by her own instincts.  So this tale is a little &quot;tight&quot; feeling as if she is chafing at the bit to do it all her own.  That said, she still shines is this tale of kidnapping and the hunt for a serial killer, showing Jensen, without doubt, is one of the best voices in series romance today.<br />Silhouette would just do better to stand back and let Jensen do what she wants!	2004-06-17

This is such a STRONG adventure, I can well understand why they picked her to write the #4 book in the 2176 series.

I do so adore her klutzy females and Tessa Riodan is another one that charms her way into your heart.  Tessa, a 39 years old, 6 foot tall &quot;pleasingly plumb&quot; lady, accepts the role of playing a turn of the century Duchess in a BBC reality show.  She is not an actress, in no form would she be considered actress material, but the pays is good, something she cannot turn down.  <br />Despite her self doubts, one look at Max Edgerton, the man cast as her &quot;Duke&quot;, hits her like a ton of bricks.  And being typical KA's heroine, she promptly braws on his foots.  You know he loses his heart instantly!!  But that is the least of her problems, there are pressing things on the front on her mind - pressing as corset!!  Breathing seriously comes before romance!<br />With a cast of nutty characters this is one fun time.  A first rate romp through love, breathing and quirky Brits!	2004-05-07

A reader looking for a true romance, needs to understand, this is very different.  Most of the book is focus on the heroine, the romance is not motivation of the story, just a part.  I went in expecting another romance, and it took me off guard.  The writing was super, but I just was not prepared for this different pace.  I truly enjoyed the writing and the adventure.  But you should really with the anticipation this is different and really not finished.  The story is left hanging, but I understand there is a second part coming later in the year.<br />So if you would like something very different and original, take this high flying adventure.	2004-04-11

I was not sure what to expect.  I love Ms. Davis' (Katherine Deauxville) Crystal Heart, likely my favourite medieval historical.  But this is straight Literature.  I guess I read for escapism/adventure and generally Literature is more thoughty.  However, I was amazed by this book.  A wonderful book that does so much.  I could not put it down  from the firs page.  It provokes, it's a stroll down memory lane - but not that fuzzy, forgetful where everything was wonderful way - but painting with such reality, warts and all.<br />a tour de force that is the book people will talk about in the coming year.	2004-03-24
