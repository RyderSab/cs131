The pictures are wonderful and there are a myriad of products. But, while browsing through a copy at my local bookstore I realized that the items pictured where not exactly my taste. The fixtures and furnishings are definitely modern, but tend to have an extremely hard edge. I love contemporary interior design, but something a little softer, a little less abstract. If you are interested in that end of the contemporary spectrum, then go for it. If you are like me, you may be dissapointed.	2000-10-30

Though that may mean precious little to you, it does shorten the list of literature I recommend. And I recommend, with all the enthusiasm I can muster, that everyone not only read, but own this masterpiece. Sure to take it's place among the classics, it was a delight to read. The detail was outstanding, emphasizing the thorough research that went into this book. But, what was most impressive was the way in which he weaved fact and fiction. After reading the book I was not only knowledgeable about the life a geisha led, I felt as if I had known one personally. A tome ripe with wisdom, this is a treasure to be passed from generation to generation.	2000-10-30

This is no exception. I usually shy away from how-to books, but this is an excellent guide. It gives just enough instruction (and examples for you to follow) to allow you to create on your own.

I felt that I wasn't getting what I wanted, but didn't know exactly what that was-until now. Making Faces is a book dedicated to teaching the layperson to become an expert. This was the first time that I got inforamtion about beauty and make-up that didn't come in a magazine (which I end up disposing of). I recommend this book to all, regardless of skin color, age or any other stipulations that we place on using make-up. Kevyn not only makes this a great book by his extreme talent, but also in his words. His warm heart and open-minded views on beauty and life in general are integrated beautifully into the book. Without a doubt, the pinnacle of this genre.	2000-10-30
