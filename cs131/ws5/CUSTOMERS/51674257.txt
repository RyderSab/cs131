Unlike his 1632 books or the Belisarius series he wrote with David Drake, there is no time travelling or sentient crystal from the far future in \\"The Rivers of War\\".  Instead, this alternate history of the War of 1812 and the early-nineteenth century expansion of America begins with only one small and thoroughly plausible point of departure from real history.  However, the effects of this small change quickly multiply and spread in a reasonably convincing manner, in the best alternate history tradition.<br /><br />The slip from real history to alternate history occurs when young officer (and adopted Cherokee) Sam Houston slips at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend on the Tallapoosa River, turning what was in reality a near-fatal injury into a relatively minor flesh would.  Instead of being incapacitated for a year, Houston is well enough to travel up the Tennessee River to Washington D.C..  He heads to the Capital on the Potomac both to receive a promotion and pursue his dream of negotiating some sort of tolerable arrangement for his adopted Cherokee nation.  Convinced that the expansion of the United States onto Cherokee land cannot be stopped, Houston hopes to convince the Cherokee that their best option is a \\"Trojan retreat\\" across the Mississippi that will leave them unbroken as a nation.  But in order to do that, he will need both the Federal Government's support (and money) and the trust of the Cherokee chiefs.<br /><br />No sooner have Houston and his Cherokee companions arrived in Washington when they find themselves under attack by a small British raiding party.  Teaming up with Sergeant Patrick \\"The Troll\\" Driscol, wounded in a battle on the Niagara River in the north, Houston helps organize a last-stand defense of the Capitol that turns him into a hero and forces the British to reconsider their battle plans for their assault on New Orleans.  Houston, Driscol, and their companions hurry to the Mississippi River, where the final battle of the War of 1812 will be fought, and the fate of the American and Cherokee nations determined.<br /><br />What is truly remarkable about \\"The Rivers of War\\" is the number of authentic historical figures Flint has managed to use as characters in his story.  Although the personalities of some of the historical figures have been at least partially invented by Flint (who claims to have followed the historical record as closely as possible), there is only one entirely fictional major character, freedman teamster Henry Crowell.  All the characters are believable, and much more realistic and multidimensional than is typical for alternate history books.  Sergeant Driscol may become uncharacteristically eloquent when discussing class struggle, but that's nothing more than a very minor irritation.<br /><br />From the Tallapoosa, Tennessee and Niagara to the Potomac and Mississippi, \\"The Rivers of War\\" is a great read, chock full of historical details that are very carefully researched, from all I can tell.  While some might be annoyed by the wealth of detail, I'm as interested in actual history as I am in alternate history, and all the details simply helped make the story more interesting for me.  I enjoyed \\"The Rivers of War\\" more than any other alternate history book I've read recently, and am looking forward to its sequel, the conclusion to the \\"Trail of Glory\\".<br /><br />I recommend \\"The Rivers of War\\" wholeheartedly.

US	51674257	R2IPIA6ABCZ73B	076790818X	997649583	A Short History of Nearly Everything	Books	3	350	379	N	N	An entertaining read, cautiously recommended	Bill Bryson's \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" has a lot of good points. It is above all a very entertaining and engaging read. Bryson writes in an informal, chatty style that at times reminded me of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. His subject is, essentially, life, the universe and (nearly) everything. Bryson aims to explore the history of science in general, summarizing not only what we know, but also how we know it - he sets himself the wonderful goal of trying to explain \\"how scientists work things out\\". It's a big task, and had Bryson accomplished it, this would have been an incredible book. As it is, \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" is still a worthwhile read, despite its flaws, which I will soon discuss.<br /><br />The organization of the book is partly chronological, partly thematic. It is divided into six parts and thirty relatively short chapters. The earlier parts focus on the physical sciences, including astronomy, cosmology, geology, physics and physical chemistry. The latter half of the book deals primarily with the life sciences - biology, ecology, botany, zoology, oceanography, organic chemistry and so on. It's a considerable challenge to organize such a large amount of material dealing with so many distantly-related subjects, and Bryson pulls it off quite well. I can make no criticism of his large-scale organization.<br /><br />However, the devil is in the details, and many of the details Bryson chooses to include in his \\"Short History\\" have little if anything to do with what he's supposedly writing about. He has a persistent tendency to head off on irrelevant tangents and lose himself in anecdotes about some of the curious characters that have walked the halls of science. Bryson wastes far too much ink relating bizarre factoids picked up in the course of his research, from William Buckland's dining habits to Gideon Mantell's twisted spine. He especially loves recounting the details of feuds and squabbles between scientists - the more intense, underhanded, unreasonable and destructive, the better. In all of this, the material we picked up the book to explore can get somewhat lost. Chapter 10, for instance, is \\"an important and salutary tale of avarice, deceit, bad science, several needless deaths, and the final determination of the age of the Earth\\" - in that order of importance.<br /><br />Reading \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\", I did greatly appreciate Bryson's ability to make clear how much scientists don't know and are still working to figure out. However, I was disappointed that despite his promise to explore \\"how scientists work things out\\", Bryson often just quotes results and conclusions without further explanation. Sometimes he doesn't even do that - modern physics is largely dismissed as wacky and incomprehensible.<br /><br />Even worse, Bryson makes several glaring errors in his discussion of physics (and perhaps also in other areas that I'm not so familiar with), far worse than any I've seen in other popular science books I've read. For example, he suggests particles with \\"spin\\" are actually spinning about an axis (which they are not) and presents entanglement as a violation of relativity (which it is not). Bryson also incorrectly claims that the production of black holes within future particle accelerators would destroy the world. In fact, these microscopic black holes would evaporate in a fraction of a nanosecond - something that would have been very nice to learn in \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\".<br /><br />I enjoy reading popular science, and much of what I've read I've found better than Bryson's \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\". I would especially recommend Brian Greene, Stephen Hawking, Alan Guth and Martin Rees for physics, astronomy and cosmology, and Richard Dawkins and Stephen J. Gould for biology. However, I know of no other work that attempts to cover nearly as many fields as Bryson's \\"Short History\\". Even though Bryson's book wasn't able to liveup to its initial promise, it was a decent read - one I recommend, though with some reservations.le to live up to its initial promise, it was a decent read - one I recommend, though with some reservations.	2005-07-13

This comic strip collection can help.<br /><br />\\"Piled Higher and Deeper\\" (\\"PhD\\") is the first collection of strips of the legendary webcomic of the same name, written (and published) by Jorge Cham of Stanford University. This volume contains comics from roughly 1997 - 2002, including classics such as<br /><br />--The Grad Student Documentary (\\"Having feasted, the grad student enters a lethargic state called \\"researching\\", in anticipation of the next free meal.\\")<br /><br />--What is... the Thesis (\\"Is it so hard to believe? That grad school isn't real?\\")<br /><br />--Post-Bachelor's Disorder (\\"Do you experience frequent headaches trying to count how many years you've been in school?\\")<br /><br />--The High School Renunion (\\"Um... well... I... I'm still in school...\\")<br /><br />and many others. From the first crudely drawn sketches of cramped classrooms and quals to the later, well-drawn strips of research and conferences, \\"PhD\\" never fails to entertain. Some of the humor may be dark and depressing, but that just makes it more realistic, and all the more potent.<br /><br />If you don't believe that a grad student comic strip could possibly be so good, feel free to check out the strip's website, [...], where all of these strips are available for free. (But be warned - reading the entire archive could be hazardous to your research, and once you start, it's hard to stop...) Why buy the book when all its content is available free online? For one thing, to thank Jorge for all the hours of procrastination that he has so kindly provided. For another, to have access to the comics even when you're away from your compu... ok, never mind. The first reason is more than good enough by itself.<br /><br />Even though \\"PhD\\" focuses on engineering, grad students in all fields should find it equally entertaining. And of course, grad students are not the only people who can appreciate this volume - former grad students and future grad students will almost certainly enjoy it as well. All grad students past, present and future should purchase this first \\"Piled Higher and Deeper\\" collection (or better yet, have it purchased for them) without delay., present and future should purchase this first \\"Piled Higher and Deeper\\" collection (or better yet, have it purchased for them) without delay.	2005-07-12

Well, in a certain sense, it turns out it can.<br /><br />The truth is that the focus of Gleick's book is not so much chaos itself as it is the people who first explored chaos theory and eventually managed to make it respectable and bring it into the mainstream. As the book's subtitle hints, Gleick is concerned mainly with how a 'new science' is 'made', not necessarily with the actual science or math involved. This was not quite what I was expecting from \\"Chaos\\", but it is actually an advantage for the book, since its age becomes somewhat irrelevant: although chaos theory itself has been growing and evolving dramatically in recent decades, \\"Chaos\\" deals only with its roots in the '60s, '70s and early '80s. On the other hand, I was hoping for more discussion of the science itself, rather than the personalities involved in its early development.<br /><br />I was also not that taken with the style of Gleick's writing. His narrative tends to jump around rapidly, often spending only a few pages on some person or event before moving on to another, commonly with little in the way of connection or logical transition. This is fine for short articles in newspapers and magazines, but it doesn't work so well in a 300+ page book. The vast cast of characters (meteorologists, physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, biologists, ecologists and many others) spins in and out of view, and it can be very difficult to get more than a general impression how the little pieces all fit together in the big picture.<br /><br />However, even though I'm complaining about the content and presentation, I'm still giving \\"Chaos\\" four stars. This is because \\"Chaos\\" managed to get me interested in and excited about nonlinear dynamics. Gleick was able to convey the sense of wonder and excitement that comes from looking at nature in a new way, through the lens of nonlinearity. He successfully presented the making of this new science as the greatest and most exciting scientific revolution since the development of quantum mechanics - with the difference that chaos is more accessible, more understandable, and applicable in a far wider range of fields.<br /><br />In short, \\"Chaos\\" still achieves its goal 18 years after it was written. It gets the reader (this reader, at least) interested in and excited about nonlinear dynamics and eager to explore the topic in greater depth. Reading Gleick's book inspired me to pick up a copy of Robert Hilborn's \\"Chaos and Nonlinear Dynamics\\" from the library and take a more serious look at the science itself. \\"Chaos\\" should make a good read for anyone who knows little or nothing about chaos or nonlinear dynamics but is curious about the topic and interested in learning a bit about its early development.sense of wonder and excitement that comes from looking at nature in a new way, through the lens of nonlinearity.

Kinzer writes in a very engaging, fast-moving manner, making his book seem at times more of a drama than a history.<br /><br />Kinzer interweaves three main topics to construct his narrative: the coup itself, the history of British and American interest and activity in Iran, and the stories of the two main characters in the historical drama: Kermit Roosevelt Jr., the CIA agent in charge of staging the coup, and Mossadegh himself. Indeed, a nearly complete (though brief) biography of Mossadegh is given over the course of the book, while many other important actors (including the Shah) receive relatively little attention.<br /><br />Kinzer's historical overview focuses largely on Britain's oil interests in Iran and how the Eisenhower administration's fear of Communist expansion eventually led to Americans taking a leading role in the coup. Even more interesting were Kinzer's brief looks at some of the effects of the coup. First among these, of course, is the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which overthrew the Shah the 1953 coup restored to power. Perhaps even more important was the enthusiastic response the coup received among leading American politicians and intelligence officers, who were eager to test out similar strategies in other uncooperative countries. Kinzer presents the initial success of the 1953 Iranian coup as a main cause of the disastrous CIA-organized overthrow of the (democratically-elected) government of Guatemala one year later. Although Kinzer does not mention the topic, I couldn't help but notice many similarities between his description of the Iranian coup and recent events in Venezuela, where the United States has also shown itself eager to get rid of a controversial but democratically-elected leader.<br /><br />I feel I should emphasize that Kinzer does not actually present the 1953 coup as the \\"Roots of Middle East Terror\\". I suspect this unfortunately exaggerated subtitle was added by the publisher in order to increase sales. However, it cannot be denied that the coup was a very important event nonetheless. It derailed one of the Middle East's most promising democracies, set the stage for the 1979 Revolution, and helped shape America's disastrous Cold War policy of overthrowing potentially uncooperative governments and installing more accommodating dictators in their place.<br /><br />A book as short as \\"All the Shah's Men\\" obviously cannot be complete in its coverage and is certainly not the last word on the 1953 coup and its effects. However, it is a wonderful introduction to the topic, engaging and illuminating although brief. Strongly recommended for those with any interest in Iran, the Middle East in general, or American foreign policy during the Cold War.present the 1953 coup as the \\"Roots of Middle East Terror\\".

US	51674257	R39T2ZDX9W8KKT	0671027360	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	2	17	21	N	N	Have fun - just don't trust the "facts"	I imagine many readers of Dan Brown's \\"Angels and Demons\\" first heard of CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) through the book. I, on the other hand, actually first heard of \\"Angels and Demons\\" through CERN. After I was hired for a summer job at CERN, I spent some time exploring their Web site. I quickly found a very long page in which they attempt to correct many of the errors about the lab (and physics in general) contained in \\"Angels and Demons\\". When I got to Europe and saw \\"Angels and Demons\\" on the top of all the bestseller lists (above even \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"), I knew I had to read it.<br /><br />What I found was a mixed bag at best. The plot (if the word can be used) is basically identical to that of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\": Harvard art history professor-cum-action hero Robert Langdon is summoned to the scene of a brutal murder to interpret mysterious symbols left on the victim's body. Teaming up with the young, attractive, resourceful, bereaved female relative of the deceased, he must follow a string of cryptic clues to unearth an ancient conspiracy, solve the mystery and save the day within a matter of hours. As in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", there is a character (if the word can be used) so obviously guilty he has to be innocent, and a character so obviously innocent he has to be guilty. The requisite final plot twist is so sharp you can see it coming from chapter 8 (of 137). In short, \\"Angels and Demons\\" is a cheesy thriller with formulaic writing and stereotyped characters so thin a light breeze would blow them away.<br /><br />Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with that. Brown clearly did not attempt to make a great work of literature when he wrote \\"Angels and Demons\\". His goal was a cheap crowd-pleasing hack and, judging by the other reviews, he's basically succeeded. Just because a novel is trashy doesn't mean that it can't be entertaining.<br /><br />However, there's a bigger problem than Brown's plot, characters and clumsy writing: his claim that (at least some of) the information in \\"Angels and Demons\\" is factual. Let's consider only the page labelled \\"FACT\\" (Brown's capitals), in which Brown claims that \\"CERN recently succeeded in producing the first particles of antimatter\\". Even ignoring the fact that antimatter has been around since the beginning of the universe, he's still dead wrong: antimatter was first experimentally observed and produced over 70 years ago, decades before CERN was founded. On the same page, Brown claims that antimatter is \\"the most powerful energy source known to man\\", which is simply ridiculous - antimatter isn't an energy source at all (very far from it). His then asks whether antimatter will save the world or destroy it, a nonsensical question. It will do neither, because it cannot do either. Had Brown gone through the trouble of looking up \\"antimatter\\" in an encyclopedia, he could have saved himself a good deal of embarrassment.<br /><br />The nonsense doesn't stop when the fiction officially starts, either. Brown's description of CERN is so far from reality that I found it absolutely hilarious. Imagine reading about X-33 spaceplanes, \\"ultramodern structure[s] of glass and steel\\", a \\"free fall tube... for stress relief\\", and grounds that \\"looked like an Ivy League campus\\" while sitting in a sweltering office (CERN considers air conditioning an unjustifiable luxury) with four desks crammed into it (without even the benefit of cubicles) in a building that (like most at CERN) could best be described as somewhere in between a trailer and a warehouse situated in what is essentially an industrial site. I couldn't help but simply laugh out loud at Brown's bizarre fantasy. All of this would be harmless, of course, were it not for the fact that CERN actually exists and is very different from Brown's invention.<br /><br />Of course, CERN, physics, and science are not the only things Brown gets wrong (they're just what I know best). Others have written about how he freely redraws the map of Rome (all the while claiming \\"References to all works of art, tombs, tunnels, and architecture in Rome are entirely factual (as are their exact locations)\\"). Still others have written about his many errors relating to Catholic ritual, Papal conclave, Switzerland and history in general. Some of Brown's mistakes can only be described as bizarre. Take for instance his claim that Christian Holy Communion is based on Aztec rituals or his apparent belief that canonization is a routine procedure for junior priests. As recent scandals have clearly demonstrated, not all priests are saints.<br /><br />In light of all these factual errors, I hope (for his own sake) that Brown's claims to do research for his books are lies. It's one thing for an author to make mistakes in a trashy novel he pulls out of his nether regions. But it would be truly pathetic if Brown actually does the rigorous research he claims and still manages to screw up so often and so spectacularly.<br /><br />Go ahead and read \\"Angels and Demons\\" - who knows, you may enjoy it.

Why were all 15 of the Union republics recognized as independent states in 1990-1991, while none of the other regions of the country were - even if they managed to attain de facto independence through force of arms (e.g., Abkhazia, Transdniestria, Chechenia)? When the USSR shattered, why did it do so exclusively along the lines drawn by Soviet leaders (mainly Stalin) a few decades earlier?<br /><br />Walker argues that the answer is the Soviet Union's curious federal structure, in which each ethnic group was given its own homeland whose status varied with respect to the size and importance of the titular nationality. The most important nationalities were given 'Union' republics - the 15 constituent members of the USSR - with \\"sovereignty\\" and an official (though meaningless for nearly all of Soviet history) right to secede from the Union. Other countries were able to use this fact to recognize the Union republics - and only the Union republics - as sovereign states without explicitly undermining any country's territorial integrity.<br /><br />After quickly reviewing the Soviet federal structure and the ambiguities of the 'sovereignty' possessed by the Union republics, Walker focuses his attention on the USSR's last few years of existence. He is most concerned with Gorbachev's attempts to take the Soviet Constitution and the right of secession (at least somewhat) seriously and his repeated efforts to draft a new Union treaty. Each successive draft of that treaty gave less and less power to the center, until the effort was aborted by the hard-liners' coup and the formation of the CIS by Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.<br /><br />Walker also gives a sympathetic explanation of the reluctance on the part of many Western leaders to encourage the dissolution of the Soviet Union (such as the famous \\"Chicken Kiev\\" speech). Walker discusses their fears that the breakup of the Soviet Union would be accompanied by a series of civil wars similar to those that later plagued the former Yugoslavia - with the added complication, of course, that the USSR had huge stockpiles of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and materials. He also surveys the attempts by the Crimea and some autonomous republics such as Abkhazia and Tatarstan to declare their own sovereignty, as well as the different interpretations that can be given to the collapse of the Soviet colossus (liberty triumphing over tyranny, or incompetent bumblers inadvertently smashing one of the most powerful countries in the world, for example).<br /><br />And he manages to do it all in only a little over 200 well-written and engaging pages. Few books so short are able to contain so much insightful explication.

Abkhazia (or Abkhazeti to Georgians, or Apsny to its current government) is a small region in northwest Georgia, which was an autonomous republic (meaning only that the titular nationality had its culture promoted and benefited from a Soviet form of affirmative action) within Georgia during Soviet times. After Georgia broke away from the Soviet Union, Abkhazia managed (with some Russian help) to break away from Georgia following a war in 1992-1993 that was accompanied by ethnic cleansing and the flight of most of the ethnic Georgians in the region (200,000-250,000, or almost half of Abkhazia's 1989 population). Abkhazia has managed to maintain de facto independence ever since, though it has not been recognized by any other nation.<br /><br />In this volume, Hewitt, a professor of Caucasian languages at the University of London, presents 16 essays on Abkhazia (in English), mostly written by Abkhazians themselves. These essays cover the geography, history, economy, language, culture, religion and demography of Abkhazia and thus form a very valuable source of information on Abkhazia for English speakers.<br /><br />Unfortunately, because all of the material comes from Abkhazians or supporters of the Abkhazian side in the current conflict, I can't consider the information they present (especially that relating to twentieth-century history) entirely trustworthy. I recently wrote a long research paper on this conflict and found myself pulling my hair out trying to deal with the conflicting claims made by the two sides on a large number of issues. The allegations of ethnic cleansing and genocide made by both sides, as well as the issue of Russia's involvement in Abkhazia and the continuing refugee crisis, all serve to create and perpetuate a great deal of tension and conflict between the two sides (as can be seen by glancing through the reviews below). By (openly and unapologetically) backing one side in such a divisive and complicated conflict, Hewitt has done his readers a disservice. He has made it hard to fully trust the information the book contains and has made it more difficult for readers to really understand the Georgia-Abkhazia conflict.<br /><br />That said, if you're interested in learning about the former (and possibly future) \\"Georgian Riviera\\", you will find a lot of information in this volume.

However, during the first class meeting, the professor made a point of instructing us to get the third edition (published in 2004), explaining that the differences between the second and third editions were significant.<br /><br />Judging by the older reviews below, he was right - the book I read seems to bear little if any resemblance to the one denounced by the other reviewers. I found it clear and readable, though it was rather basic and dry. But then, I wasn't expecting great literature - this is a introductory compsci textbook, after all. Though it could be dull at times, it generally managed to get its information across clearly, which is all it needs to do. There were some typos, of course, though probably not more than should be expected to accompany such a major revision. The book's main flaw was an index that had essentially no relation to the actual text itself. A corrected index is available at the book's Web site.<br /><br />In terms of organization, Goodrich and Tamassia start off with a brief introduction to Java, object oriented design and a brief and very basic discussion of running time and asymptotic analysis. They then work their way through basic data structures and abstract data types - stacks, queues, vectors, lists, trees (general, binary, and binary search), priority queues, heaps, dictionaries, hash tables and graphs. They discuss the structures' purposes and major operations, analyze the operations' running times, and include decent, heavily-documented Java implementations of some of the structures and methods. They also do some stuff with algorithms, though generally nothing very complex or sophisticated. I used this book in an introductory data structures course at a liberal arts college, which managed to cover pretty much everything in the book with little difficulty.<br /><br />There are a lot of exercises at the end of each chapter. Goodrich and Tamassia divide them up into progressively more complex \\"Reinforcement\\", \\"Creativity\\" and \\"Projects\\" sections. My instructor preferred to assign problems and programming assignments of his own creation, though, so I don't know how helpful or useful the exercises in the book actually are.<br /><br />All in all, it seem Goodrich and Tamassia noticed the sort of reviews the earlier editions of this book were getting and took steps to correct the many problems they had. I expect that if you have to use the book in a data structures course, you'll find it at least reasonably clear and generally acceptable.

As other reviewers have mentioned, Taylor often uses quite a few words to say not very much at all. It seems as though he tried to mimic the chatty style of Griffiths, but went a bit overboard. Though I generally don't mind verbosity, at times even I was annoyed by the slow pace of the book - especially after I checked Goldstein's book out of the library and was able to see how much more elegantly and efficiently he was able to cover the same material (and more!).<br /><br />The upside to Taylor's wordiness is that he generally manages to explain everything in an easy-to-understand manner. It may even be easy enough to serve as a text for an introductory physics course, though that could be a stretch. Unfortunately, this book is probably at a level too high for an introductory course, but at the same time too low for a more advanced course.<br /><br />The overall organisation of the book is not bad. Taylor divides it into \\"essential\\" material for a one-semester course and optional material that can be studied if time permits. The first five chapters review Newtonian mechanics (Newton's Laws, projectile motion, momentum, energy and harmonic oscillations). If the book is being used in an intermediate class, these chapters should be blasted through as quickly as possible (possibly just left to reader), in order to get to the more interesting material in the rest of the book. The essential material is rounded out by chapters on the calculus of variations, Lagrange's equation, the two-body central force problem, non-inertial reference frames, rigid-body rotation, coupled oscillations and normal modes, all designed to be read in sequence. The optional material consists of five chapters on nonlinear mechanics and chaos, Hamiltonian mechanics, collision theory, special relativity and continuum mechanics. These chapters are designed to be mutually independent - none depends on any of the others, so they can be read in any order.<br /><br />There are plenty of problems, which Taylor labels with one, two or three stars, depending on their difficulty (though I personally found some of the two-star problems more challenging than most of the three-star ones). Taylor also includes some problems that need to be done using Mathematica or Maple, which is a plus. These problems are clearly marked and can give students some experience with this increasingly important software.<br /><br />I had some trouble deciding between three and four stars, but eventually decided to go with three. However, I was already familiar with all of the mathematics Taylor introduces. Those who would be meeting eigenvalues and differential equations for the first time may find the book somewhat more interesting than I did.y of the others, so they can be read in any order. <br /> <br />There are plenty of problems, which Taylor labels with one, two or three stars, depending on their difficulty (though I personally found some of the two-star problems more challenging than most of the three-star ones).

In truth, &quot;Command Line&quot; isn't really a book. It began its life as an online post, and was only published after the fact. In it, Stephenson sketches out a brief outline of the development of computers - especially personal computers and their operating systems - during the 1980s and `90s. It is a quick and fun read, filled with Stephensonian humor and creative metaphors that both entertain and enlighten.<br />In the course of &quot;Command Line,&quot; Stephenson briefly touches on the basics of programming before moving on to discuss the history of operating systems over the last twenty years. He looks at the main operating systems out there (specifically Mac, Windows, Linux, BeOS), how they evolved, and their attractions and advantages. His main points are that &quot;it is the fate of operating systems to become free&quot; and that Microsoft's commitment to maintaining its own closed operating system will cripple its broader software development activities, much in the way Apple was hurt by its insistence on producing its own hardware. Though not much is developed, there is a lot of interesting food for thought in these few pages.<br />Stephen works largely through metaphors, and &quot;Command Line&quot; is written for the layperson. Few people should have any difficulty getting through the book, even without computer experience. Amazon's insistence that the book was written &quot;for an audience of coders and hackers&quot; strikes me as bizarre. There is almost nothing technical in &quot;Command Line,&quot; and what is technical (a brief discussion of the Linux file tree is the only topic that comes to mind) is not critical to understanding any of his points and arguments.<br />In addition to summarizing the history of operating systems, Stephenson also considers some related cultural topics, such as the significance of the graphical user interface as opposed to the command line. Although some of this was interesting, there were a few digressions I thought didn't work particularly well, and which I would have expected to be edited out (or at least significantly revised) before publishing.<br />Although &quot;Command Line&quot; was written five years ago (a long time in the computer world), its age does not damage it much (especially in the historical sections). If you're interested in the history of personal computing over the last twenty years, &quot;In the Beginning... was the Command Line&quot; is a quick read that can serve as an entertaining introduction. Although it doesn't have much substance, it still manages to make many interesting points. Unless you are a hard-core Stephenson fanatic, &quot;Command Line&quot; is probably not worth purchasing. Since it was originally nothing more than a post on the Internet, it can still easily be found online.user interface as opposed to the command line.

Neal Stephenson comes through on this volume, and those of us who were concerned by &quot;Quicksilver&quot; can give a sigh of relief.<br />&quot;The Confusion&quot; covers the years 1689-1702 and consists of two interlocking books, &quot;Bonanza&quot; and &quot;The Juncto.&quot;  Since events in each book influence those in the other, they are con-fused so that the volume as a whole is less confusing; we switch back and forth between the two books, reading a few chapters in one before turning to the other.  The approach works well.  Instead of jumping back to 1689 in the middle of the volume, the whole story unfolds more or less chronologically.  There are occasionally gaps of an entire year or two in the narrative, which is a little disconcerting, but helps to keep the plot moving.<br />At the beginning of &quot;Bonanza,&quot; we rejoin Jack Shaftoe, King of the Vagabonds, some four years after he was enslaved by the Barbary Corsairs.  A fever has cured his pox and restored his sanity, but at the same time removed all his memories of the past four years.  Jack learns that he is part of a group of galley slaves - the Cabal - plotting to steal a boatload of silver from the Spanish and use part of the proceeds to buy their freedom.  There is only one problem: the silver they capture turns out to be gold.  Even worse, this gold has incredible alchemical powers - or, at least, so the alchemists believe.  Terrified that their alchemical gold will be spent and thus con-fused with the common metal, the Esoteric Brotherhood will pursue the Cabal to the ends of the earth to get it back - or, failing that, to get revenge.<br />Eliza, meanwhile, has involuntarily donated her considerable fortune to the French war effort after being captured by privateer Jean Bart while fleeing to England.  As she tries to recover, the European economy is thrown into confusion by a series of bad loans and bad harvests coupled with the seemingly endless wars that have sucked up all of the continent's money.  Eliza, along with &quot;The Juncto,&quot; a powerful group of English politicians, has the task of rebuilding Europe's financial system on the basis of trade, laying the groundwork for modern economics.  Her task is not made any easier by the alchemists, who know of her connection to Jack Shaftoe, and hope to get to him through her.<br />As I hoped, I found &quot;The Confusion&quot; more entertaining than &quot;Quicksilver.&quot;  The pace is much quicker, and the action and actual plot development makes the volume much more engrossing.  I occasionally got the feeling that more happened in particular scenes in &quot;The Confusion&quot; (for example, the Duc d'Arcachon's birthday party) than in the whole of &quot;Quicksilver.&quot;  There's still plenty of interesting errata (as we expect in a Stephenson book), though Daniel Waterhouse is largely missing - he doesn't appear until about 2/3rds of the way through the volume, and scampers off to Massachusetts pretty quickly after that.  Finally, the conclusion does a wonderful job setting up the final volume; I can hardly wait until it's out.<br />Those who have made their way through &quot;Quicksilver&quot; owe it to themselves to move onto &quot;The Confusion&quot; so that their efforts can be rewarded.  If you were hesitant about starting \\"The Baroque Cycle\\" after reading mixed reviews of the first volume, you can rest assured that &quot;The Confusion&quot; makes it all worthwhile.  If &quot;The System of the World&quot; is up to the standard set by &quot;The Confusion&quot; (and I suspect it will be), &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot;will end up as a masterpiece of massive historical fiction.will end up as a masterpiece of massive historical fiction.	2004-06-24
US	51674257	R17GO0HJDPU2AA	0553573861	755271511	Zodiac	Books	4	35	36	N	N	Yes, &quot;Eco-Thriller&quot;	&quot;Zodiac&quot; is Neal Stephenson's second book, written between the unimpressive &quot;The Big U&quot; and the cyberpunk classic &quot;Snow Crash.&quot;  It was mildly successful and according to Stephenson, &quot;on first coming out in 1988 it quickly developed a cult following among water-pollution-control engineers and was enjoyed, though rarely bought, by many radical environmentalists.&quot;  Unlike Stephenson's more recent works, it involves only one linear plot line, and is also of a more reasonable size.  This may make it his most accessible work, though it isn't his most entertaining.<br />The story is told in the first person, from the perspective of Sangamon &quot;S.T.&quot; Taylor, a Boston chemist employed by the Group of Environmental Extremists (GEE), International - an organization probably inspired by Greenpeace.  S.T. works as a professional headache for industrial polluters flaunting the law and endangering their communities.  His job is to terrorize the companies into acting in what is really their own best interest (i.e., not destroying the earth for short-term savings).  Of course, it should go without saying that S.T. does not actually use terrorism to terrorize these polluters.  Rather, he works with a potent mix of trespassing, his classic tactic of plugging up the pipes dumping toxic waste into the water supply, and his ultimate weapon: Bad Publicity.<br />&quot;Zodiac&quot; starts of with some fun actions of this sort, but the story does not really begin until S.T. unexpectedly finds incredibly large amounts of incredibly toxic PCBs in Boston Harbor.  Just as soon as he starts his investigation, however, the poisons disappear - which, if it had happened spontaneously, would be a mind-boggling 'violation' of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.  Since there's no known way for PCBs to be removed from the water by hand, the only explanation is that S.T. has committed the screw-up of a lifetime.  No sooner has S.T. resigned himself to this fate than the PCBs reappear, in even greater quantities.  That's when large numbers of people start trying to kill him.  To say nothing of the Satanists.  Framed as an ecoterrorist, S.T. is forced to flee Boston and join forces with the real environmental extremists in order to unravel the mystery of the PCBs, redeem himself, and, quite possibly, save the world.<br />So &quot;Zodiac&quot; really is an &quot;Eco-Thriller,&quot; and I enjoyed it as much as (if not more than) the more famous &quot;Snow Crash.&quot;  At the very least, &quot;Zodiac&quot; has aged better.  While some parts of &quot;Snow Crash&quot; read like the the wildest fantasies of the .com boom, &quot;Zodiac&quot; could easily be set anytime in the next (or past) twenty years.  Many of the book's apparent flaws come from comparison to Stephenson's later work: &quot;Zodiac&quot; lacks both the intricate, awe-inspiring complexity of &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; and &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot; as well as much of the indescribable brand of humor that made &quot;Snow Crash&quot; and &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; so memorable.  Another gripe could be characters - except for a few main characters, they remain vague outlines for the most part.  We know they're present, but don't really get a clear picture of them.<br />At any rate, if you're a Stephenson fan, &quot;Zodiac&quot; is well worth a read.  Even compared to his later works, it shouldn't disappoint.  On the other hand, if you're new to Stephenson, &quot;Zodiac&quot; is as good a place to start as any.  Although it's not the experience that &quot;Snow Crash&quot; and &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; are, it's also more accessible and not nearly as imposing as &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; and &quot;The Baroque Cycle.&quot;  I recommend it.fate than the PCBs reappear, in even greater quantities.

It merely requires a complete ignorance of both life and literature.&quot;<br />-Oscar Wilde<br />Well, perhaps that's a bit too harsh.  The truth is that overall I enjoyed Neal Stephenson's &quot;Quicksilver,&quot; even though at times I was frustrated by its slow pace.  &quot;Quicksilver&quot; has all of the complexity and detail that made &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; impressive, but relatively little of the humor and action that made it such an engaging and entertaining read.  I was torn between 3 or 4 stars, and decided to be generous since it's only the first volume of the gigantic &quot;Baroque Cycle.&quot;  I am hoping (expecting, really) that things will pull together in the future volumes, and much that seems tedious and unnecessary in this 900-page monster will fall into place.<br />Even though it's only a third of the Cycle, &quot;Quicksilver&quot; is still made up of no less than three distinct books  - &quot;Quicksilver,&quot; &quot;King of the Vagabonds&quot; and &quot;Odalisque.&quot;  &quot;Quicksilver&quot; (the book and the volume) opens in 1713, when the mysterious Enoch Root arrives in Massachusetts to summon Daniel Waterhouse back to Europe, apparently to try to settle the famous feud between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.  As Daniel is chased around the north Atlantic by Edward &quot;Blackbeard&quot; Teach, he goes over his memories of the 1660s and early 1670s, during which time he became Newton's assistant, a member of the Royal Society, and one of the most prominent Puritan dissidents of the Restoration.<br />We then abandon Daniel for twelve years and 275 pages, to travel with the aptly named &quot;Half-Cocked&quot; Jack Shaftoe, the &quot;King of the Vagabonds,&quot; as he heads to Vienna to defend Christendom from the Turk - and do a bit of looting on the side.  At Vienna he rescues Eliza, Turkish harem slave (odalisque) originally from Qwghlm, and the two of them make their slow way back across Europe.  Eventually they reach Amsterdam, where Eliza shows herself a shrewd investor, begins to build a financial empire, and dedicates herself to the eradication of slavery.  Jack, meanwhile, sails off to sea, to reappear in the Cycle's second volume.<br />The third book, &quot;Odalisque,&quot; in which Daniel and Eliza both play prominent roles in the 'Glorious Revolution' of 1688-1689, makes the slog through the first 600 pages more or less worthwhile.  Eliza is now sent to spy at the court of Louis XIV at Versailles, while Daniel plays courtier to James II and organizes his Revolution.  Although the Revolution makes for a conclusion of a sort, relatively little is resolved, and plenty is set up for the next volume.<br />The main theme in &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot; seems to be the development of the modern world - modern finance, modern politics and modern science.  The conflict between alchemy (represented by Newton) and the new 'natural philosophy' of Leibniz and his supporters promises to be central to the coming volumes.  Lurking in the background is the mysterious 'Enoch the Red,' for all we know, immortal and omniscient.  Those who have read &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; will recognize Enoch, note that &quot;The Baroque Cycle's&quot; main characters seem to be the ancestors of the stars of &quot;Cryptonomicon,&quot; and wonder whether there are deeper connections.<br />Do I recommend &quot;Quicksilver?&quot;  It depends, I suppose.  The book can be trying, but five-star moments are  many (and far between).  I was especially impressed by the way Stephenson weaves together his plot and fictional characters with the actual events and personalities of the time.  Occasional epistolary chapters (in which the story is told through letters written by the main characters) make for more interesting reading, especially in &quot;Odalisque.&quot;  There are a number of footnotes (annoying in a novel, but probably necessary to help the reader keep track ofeverything), some maps and genealogical charts, as well as a ten-page long Dramatis Personae (very helpful, especially since it distinguishes between fact and fiction).<br />If you have read and enjoyed &quot;Cryptonomicon,&quot; &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot; is the obvious next step.  Otherwise, I suggest you check out &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; first - I found it more accessible and more entertaining, and reading it will let you decide whether or not you enjoy Stephenson's style.  And, as I mentioned, there may well be connections between the tomes.

Even though &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; is an anthology, it should be read before &quot;1634: The Galileo Affair,&quot; since stories in it introduce and develop many of the main characters (Father Mazzare, the Stones, Mazarini) and set up much of the plot.  &quot;1632&quot; and &quot;1633&quot; should be read as well, of course.<br />At the beginning of &quot;1634: The Galileo Affair,&quot; the new United States of Europe is not in the best strategic situation.  Simultaneously at war with England, France, Spain, Denmark, Austria and various other polities, it is running short of allies - the Dutch Republic is in dire straights, while Bohemia has its hands full trying to break away from Austria.  To try to break out of this encirclement and tap into Mediterranean trade, an embassy is sent to the Venetian Republic.<br />At the head of the embassy are Father Mazzare and Reverend Jones, along with Sharon Nichols and Tom 'Stoner' Stone, a nurse and chemist (respectively), who will be sharing their medical knowledge with the Italians as a demonstration of good faith.  Accompanying Stone are his three teenage sons, who (following their hormones and the lovely Giovanna) quickly fall in with a group of incompetent but enthusiastic revolutionaries hoping to Americanize Italy.  They are sucked into a wacky, hare-brained scheme to free Galileo from the Inquisition and take him north to Grantville and Freedom.  This plot would probably be harmless were it not receiving expert assistance from a French agent provocateur under orders to discredit the USE.  Meanwhile, the copies of the Papers of the Second Vatican Council and related twentieth century Catholic theology that were sent to Pope Urban VIII in &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; have been creating quite a stir in the highest ranks of the Church.  The Pope is carefully considering what to do about Galileo, as well as the USE and its curious religious toleration.<br />&quot;1634: The Galileo Affair&quot; is quite a bit different from the other novels that have so far been published in the 163x series (and probably from those yet to be published, as well).  This seems to be Flint's intention, and the reason he's writing the series with a large number of coauthors.  In this volume, he is joined by English lawyer Andrew Dennis, with the result that military and political aspects of the story decrease dramatically, while more time is spent on romance and lawyerly discussion.  Although I enjoyed the book overall, this is not my favorite approach.<br />Another notable feature of this volume in the series is that it ignores all of the plot threads developed in &quot;1633,&quot; focusing entirely on Italy.  According to Flint, &quot;The Galileo Affair&quot; is only the first of several books that will take place in 1634, each pursuing only one story line at a time, though all still tying in with each other.  Currently five volumes are planned for this &quot;1634: ...&quot; 'story explosion' - &quot;The Baltic War&quot; (with David Weber), &quot;Escape from the Tower&quot; (Eric Flint solo), &quot;The Austrian Princess&quot; (with Virginia DeMarce) and &quot;Bohemia&quot; (a tentative title, with Mike Spehar) in addition to &quot;The Galileo Affair.&quot;  While some may be frustrated by the lack of connection to &quot;1633,&quot; I personally feel that this approach is much preferable to the 'Robert Jordan method' of trying to cover every plot line at once and ending up not advancing any of them.<br />At any rate, if you enjoyed &quot;1633&quot; and &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; &quot;1634: The Galileo Affair&quot; should be worth checking out.

In this volume, he is joined by English lawyer Andrew Dennis, with the result that military and political aspects of the story decrease dramatically, while more time is spent on romance and lawyerly discussion.  Although I enjoyed the book overall, this is not my favorite approach.<br />Another notable feature of this volume in the series is that it ignores all of the plot threads developed in &quot;1633,&quot; focusing entirely on Italy.  According to Flint, &quot;The Galileo Affair&quot; is only the first of several books that will take place in 1634, each pursuing only one story line at a time, though all still tying in with each other.  Currently five volumes are planned for this &quot;1634: ...&quot; 'story explosion' - &quot;The Baltic War&quot; (with David Weber), &quot;Escape from the Tower&quot; (Eric Flint solo), &quot;The Austrian Princess&quot; (with Virginia DeMarce) and &quot;Bohemia&quot; (a tentative title, with Mike Spehar) in addition to &quot;The Galileo Affair.&quot;  While some may be frustrated by the lack of connection to &quot;1633,&quot; I personally feel that this approach is much preferable to the 'Robert Jordan method' of trying to cover every plot line at once and ending up not advancing any of them.<br />At any rate, if you enjoyed &quot;1633&quot; and &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; &quot;1634: The Galileo Affair&quot; should be worth checking out.  If you're a fan of the series primarily because of Flint's military writing, the library may be the best choice.	2004-06-14
US	51674257	R1C2Q68ZCJ82B2	074347175X	862855904	Ring of Fire (Assiti Shards)	Books	5	90	91	N	N	A Solid Anthology	&quot;Ring of Fire&quot; is a collection of short stories set in the universe created by Eric Flint in his 2000 novel &quot;1632.&quot; In &quot;1632,&quot; the town of Grantville is ripped from modern day West Virginia and dropped in the middle of Germany, in the middle of the Thirty Years' War, by a cosmic accident (commonly considered an Act of God) which is eventually dubbed the 'Ring of Fire.'<br />The fifteen stories in this anthology seem to have been written after the publication of &quot;1632,&quot; but before that of its sequel &quot;1633.&quot; They take place concurrently with the action in those two novels: &quot;Power to the People&quot; by Loren K. Jones goes all the way back to the Ring of Fire that kicked off 1632, while Eric Flint's &quot;The Wallenstein Gambit&quot; is set in the middle of the year 1633. As with all anthologies, the styles and qualities of the stories varied from author to author, from the 16-page &quot;To Dye For&quot; by Mercedes Lackey to Flint's 120-page novella. However, although I enjoyed some stories in &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; more than others, I can honestly say there were none I actively disliked, which is pretty much as good as it gets for anthologies.<br />What makes &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; so interesting is the fact that it is not your typical anthology. Most 'spin-off' anthologies like this one feature stories peripheral to the main plot of the series, involve minor characters and don't play a significant role in the grand scheme of things. Some stories such as &quot;Power to the People&quot; and &quot;When the Chips Are Down&quot; by Jonathan Cresswell and Scott Washburn seem to follow that model. However, most of them actually play important roles shaping both the plots and the characters of the later books in the series. For example, David Weber (who coauthored &quot;1633&quot;) writes a story about the founding of the new American navy that plays a prominent role in &quot;1633&quot; and Andrew Dennis's story sets up &quot;1634: The Galileo Affair&quot; (which he coauthored) and develops some of its main characters. Meanwhile, &quot;The Wallenstein Gambit&quot; incorporates other stories in &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; redraws the map of Europe, and lays the basis for forthcoming &quot;1634: ...&quot; novels.<br />The point is that this anthology plays an important role in the series, and needs to be read by anyone who wants to enjoy future 163x books. This is a part of Eric Flint's interesting approach to the whole series, which tries to make the '1632 universe' a full-bodied and realistically complex place. To do this Flint writes the main books of the series with a number of different coauthors (David Weber, Andrew Dennis, Mike Spehar, Virginia DeMarce), while at the same time allowing all of the authors who contributed to &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; to make their own mark on the developing series. Flint has even begun publishing fan fiction in an online magazine (the &quot;Grantville Gazette&quot;) and incorporating it into 163x novels. It is (to my knowledge) a unique approach, and so far seems to be producing excellent results.<br />So not only is &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; a solid anthology in its own right, it is required reading for those who intend to follow Flint et al.'s 163x series. Although &quot;1633&quot; builds off of several stories in &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; it can be understood and enjoyed without reading the anthology. The same is less true of the &quot;1634: ...&quot; books that are currently being written and published. If you enjoyed &quot;1632&quot; enough to want to read more books in the series, &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; should be a sure bet.<br />To conclude, and to emphasize one last time the important role played by &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; in the development of the 163x series, I will sketch out the current shape of the series and indicate which stories in &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; are incorporated into each of the planned books. Of the fifteen stories in the anthology, only three do not seem to play a role in the larger series, though they may yet be incorporated into one of the volumes currently being planned or written.<br />&quot;1633&quot; with David Weber<br />---&quot;In the Navy&quot; by David Weber<br />---&quot;A Matter of Consultation&quot; by S.L.

'How?' you ask? Who cares? Flint gives some far-future science fiction explanation. Most of the town's residents conclude that the 'Ring of Fire' is simply an Act of God.<br />But the question of how Grantville comes to seventeenth century Germany is not important. All that matters is what happens once the heavily armed town finds itself thirteen years into the Thirty Years' War, one of the most destructive religious conflicts in the history of Europe. Surrounded on all sides by hostile countries and marauding armies, mere survival is the town's chief concern. Grantville's modern weapons might be - barely - sufficient to hold off the ragtag bands of looters and mercenaries roaming the countryside. But if one of the major powers striving for supremacy over Central Europe decides to crush the town, Grantville will not be able to resist them on its own.<br />So the residents of Grantville decide to fight fire with fire and kick off the American Revolution a century and a half ahead of schedule. Grantville's only hope of survival lies in finding allies willing to tolerate democracy and religious pluralism, while at the same time recruiting those of their new neighbors who are sick and tired of being slaughtered by their aristocrats or for their religion. The early seventeenth century, with (on the one hand) feudalism and religion discredited by bloody warfare, persecution and oppression and (on the other) modern theories of representative government and rule of law just beginning to rear their heads, offers the slim possibility that Grantville will be able to pull through.<br />All this makes for a fast-paced and highly entertaining story. Flint, before this book best known for military science fiction, spends a lot of time on battle scenes, but still tries to focus on the power of ideas and ordinary people to change the world. Character development is better than normal for the genre, though still not great. Some characters, especially the sinister industrialist Tom Simpson, remain one-dimensional. Flint, who got a Master's Degree in African history before spurning the ivory tower to go into union organizing, often interrupts the narrative with brief history lessons, which I personally found interesting.<br />Although &quot;1632&quot; was originally written as a stand-alone novel, it was so popular that Flint was convinced to expand the story into a full-blown alternate history series, which continues in &quot;1633&quot; (coauthored with David Weber) and the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; anthology. This means that even though there are more volumes for those who enjoy &quot;1632,&quot; this book still comes to a satisfying conclusion and can be read on its own, without commitment to the larger series.

Thanks to its citizens' modern knowledge and weapons, a lot of luck, and an alliance with the powerful King of Sweden, the town was able to keep from being wiped out in its first year in the seventeenth century. So we move on to &quot;1633.&quot;<br />But in the 1630s, there are few European countries as powerful as France, which is controlled by the capable and ruthless Cardinal Richelieu. When stolen history books from Grantville make their way into his hands and show him the future development of France, Richelieu is not pleased. Along with the kings of England and Spain, Richelieu organizes the forces of absolute monarchy and established religion to stamp out the representative government, rule of law and religious pluralism that threaten to cast them into the dustbin of history. In their sights are potential revolutionary Oliver Cromwell, the insufferable Dutch Republic and, of course, Grantville.<br />Even though &quot;1633&quot; is a sequel to Flint's &quot;1632&quot; (and incorporates a few of the short stories in the &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; anthology), it is really the first book in the series that Flint eventually decided to set in the &quot;1632&quot; universe. &quot;1632&quot; was originally designed to be a stand-alone novel, and it was only its unexpected success that led Flint to consider writing the full-blown series, collaborating with a series of coauthors, of which David Weber is the first.<br />Thus &quot;1633&quot; is a very different beast than &quot;1632.&quot; Instead of being a fully self-contained novel, &quot;1633&quot; sets up several of the various plot strands that will be pursued in the 1634 books currently being written and published. There is much more character development, which fleshes out some of the characters who were relatively one-dimensional in 1632 (a good thing, in my opinion). On the other hand, there are fewer battles and a generally slower pace (which I did not mind). Despite leaving several threads hanging for future volumes, the book does have a solid conclusion.<br />If you read and enjoyed &quot;1632,&quot; I would definitely recommend going on to &quot;1633,&quot; though you may want to read &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; first - several of the short stories in that anthology were written before &quot;1633&quot; and incorporated into it by Flint and Weber, even though &quot;1633&quot; was published first.

After being expelled from the Communist Party, he left Poland and began working on his three-volume 'handbook' of Marxism: \\"Main Currents of Marxism: Its Origin, Growth, and Dissolution,\\" which was completed in the 1970s.<br />This volume - the third and final in the work - looks at Marxism after the Russian Revolution. It begins with a discussion of the features and development of Stalinism and then presents a series of chapters concerning major Marxist writers and philosophers from the period 1920 - 1970.  He traces the development of Stalinism in the 1930s and 1940s as well as the question of whether the Soviet Union abandoned Stalinism after Stalin's death.  His conclusion is that the essential features of Stalinism (as defined by him) were largely kept in place by post-1953 Soviet leaders.  In his view (one largely accepted today, but not necessarily when this was written in the 1970s) programs of reform by Khrushchev and others did not significantly alter the Stalinist foundations of the Soviet Union.<br />After Stalin, Kolakowski turns to some less important Marxist figures of the twentieth century, including Trotsky, Gramsci, Lukacs, Marcuse and the Frankfurt School.  In keeping with the title of this volume, \\"The Breakdown,\\" most of these figures come in for harsh criticism.  Trotsky is presented as a deposed-dictator-turned-democrat and the 'critical theory' of the Frankfurt School is characterized as a manifestation of the dissolution of Marxism.<br />The final chapter is a long review of developments in Marxism since Stalin's death, which Kolakowski considered expanding into a fourth volume, but ultimately included here in condensed form.  It features a discussion of reforms in Yugoslavia (especially attempts to set up workers' councils) as well as Maoism.  Since Kolakowski was writing in the 1970s, his discussion here is severely dated and of relatively little use to present readers.<br />As with the other volumes in this series, I was somewhat put off by the amount of philosophy in this work.

After being expelled from the Communist Party, he left Poland and began working on his three-volume 'handbook' of Marxism: \\"Main Currents of Marxism: Its Origin, Growth, and Dissolution,\\" which was completed in the 1970s.<br />This volume - the first - deals mainly with the works of the founders of Marxism, namely Marx and Engels. Kolakowski begins his discussion of Marxism by considering \\"the question whether modern Communism, in its ideology and institutions, is the legitimate heir of Marxist doctrine... The argument of the present work is that the question is wrongly formulated and that attempts to answer it are not worth while.\\" Instead of considering whether Marx would approve of the Soviet Union, Kolakowski in \\"Main Currents of Marxism\\" to attempt to trace how the original idea came to serve as a rallying point for multiple mutually hostile forces. The question he seeks to answer is, \\"What were the ambiguities and conflicting tendencies in the idea itself which led to its developing as it did?\\"<br />Kolakowski begins by considering the history of some of the philosophical issues and questions that Marx addressed and that helped to shape his thinking. The first chapter traces the history of some important issues in Western philosophy from Plotinus through Hegel. Among the issues considered are the contingency of human existence, the unity of subject and object, and how humanity can achieve reconciliation with itself and with the world. Following this discussion are deeper looks at some of Marx's main influences, Hess, Feuerbach and the Hegelian Left.<br />After a chronological survey of Marx and Engels's early work of the 1840s, Kolakowski spends some time analyzing other socialist ideas in the first half of the nineteenth century. Among those considered are Saint-Simon, Owen, Fourier, Proudhon, Blanc and Blanqui. Kolakowski then outlines Marx's major struggles following the publication of \\"The Communist Manifesto,\\" including the 1848 revolutions and the Paris Commune. The First International and Marx's conflict with Bakunin receive especially detailed consideration.<br />The final major section of this volume is a thematic treatment of Marx's general philosophy. Kolakowski takes the view that there was not a break between Marx's early and later writings and makes extensive use of the Paris Manuscripts and the \\"Grundrisse\\" as well as \\"Capital\\" in this final section. In general Kolakowski's conclusions are critical: he considers Marx's labor theory of value and 'historical materialism' to be essentially useless. Specifically, Kolakowski notes that these ideas can be interpreted in a number of fashions, and can be used to support conclusions that range from absurdity to truism.<br />Toward the end of this volume is a chapter on Engels and his contribution to Marxism following Marx's death. The final chapter is a recapitulation and philosophical commentary in which Kolakowski addresses three final questions: the differences between Marx's Marxism and that of Engels; the motifs of Romanticism, Faustian Prometheanism and Enlightenment rationalism in Marx's thought; and the issue of Marxism as a source of Leninism. Considering the latter, he concludes that \\"the Leninist-Stalinist version of socialism was a possible interpretation, though certainly not the only one, of Marx's doctrine.\\" A complete discussion of this issue is reserved for the second volume in the series.<br />Although there is a lot of good stuff in \\"Main Currents of Marxism,\\" I can't give it five stars. Essentially, the work is too philosophical for my tastes. I picked it up out of a historical interest in the development of Marxism and found myself somewhat unprepared for its philosophical aspects.

After being expelled from the Communist Party, he left Poland and began working on his three-volume 'handbook' of Marxism: \\"Main Currents of Marxism: Its Origin, Growth, and Dissolution,\\" which was completed in the 1970s.<br />This volume - the second in the series - traces the development of the doctrine after the deaths of its founders, Marx and Engels.  The period covered by this volume roughly corresponds to that of the Second International, from the late nineteenth century through the First World War and Russian Revolution.  The first part of this volume is a series of biographies of major figures of European socialism at that time, including Kautsky, Luxemburg, Berstein, Jaures, Labriola and others.  The last few chapters consist of an overview of post-Decembrist Russian socialism, covering Herzen, Chernyshevsky and the Russian Marxists.  The final chapter considers the Russian Revolution and the transformation of Bolshevism from a theory of the state to a state ideology.<br />Kolakowski's basic premiss is that the period of the Second International represented the 'golden age' of Marxism - the period during which a solid base of Marxist theory existed, but there was no sterile dogma enforced on Marxists.  Throughout the course of this work, Kolakowski emphasizes that the Marxist doctrine could be (and was) interpreted in various different (and often contradictory) ways by different people.  This relative freedom of interpretation was one of the chief features of this period in the development of the Marxist doctrine, which was largely lost with the development of Stalinism.<br />Kolakowski's purpose in this work is to trace the history of a doctrine, and as a result all three volumes of \\"Main Currents of Marxism\\" are quite heavy on philosophy.  Although this isn't exactly surprising - since Kolakowski is himself a philosopher - I picked up this work out of an historical interest in Marxism and found myself somewhat unprepared for its philosophical aspects.  It made for tough and occasionally frustrating reading for me, since I don't have an extensive background in philosophy.<br />Due to the huge amount of material that Kolakowski covers in this volume, he is often forced to skim over some of this material relatively quickly.  In many chapters, this only increases the difficulty that beginners will have in assimilating the philosophical discussion.  An additional result is that many of his conclusions seems more general and sweeping than the prior discussion would justify.  One annoying example is his seemingly out-of-hand condemnation of most anti-Bolshevik movements in the Russian Revolution as hopeless utopianism, with minimal discussion of the actual programs of these movements.  The edition that I read was also marred by the serious flaw of some 30 missing pages towards the end of the book (479 - 510).  I don't know how common this is, but if possible it may be a good idea to make sure those pages are there before purchasing.  A final complaint is that I would have liked Kolakowski to say at least one word about Marxism in America, a subject that is not mentioned in this volume.<br />All in all, \\"Main Currents of Marxism\\" is a tough read, especially for those who aren't philosophically inclined.  In the end, however, those who make it through will be rewarded with extensive knowledge of the development of Marxism and the various forms it took in the golden age that followed its founders' deaths and preceded the advent of Stalinism.<br />Contents:<br />I.

Written in 1998-1999, it begins its tale with Brezhnev's last years, then surveys Gorbachev and Perestroika, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the rule of Yeltsin in the new Russian Federation.  There's a lot of good information in this volume; Simes obviously has extensive knowledge Russia's past and its present situation.  His access to major figures in both Russia and the United States is also impressive and allows him to mention large numbers of famous names and imposing titles.  His prose is punchy and keeps the narrative moving.<br />Two problems, however, have led me to take off two stars from my rating.  First of all, large sections of the book are far too autobiographical for my taste.  Much of the early chapters consists of Simes running through all the meetings he attended (often in the company of Richard Nixon) concerning Yeltsin, Gorbachev and Perestroika.  In these sections, \\"After the Collapse\\" reads more like Simes' memoirs than an account of the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia.  (In its worst moments, it reads more like Nixon's memoirs than anything else.)  It's nice that Simes talked with Ronald Reagan once and once sat next to Barbara Bush at a state dinner, but reading about this adds nothing to my knowledge of Russia and its transition from Communism.<br />The second major problem is that the book is just not well organized.  Most chapters have trouble developing an overarching theme and the narrative often jumps around in a disjointed fashion, without giving adequate treatment to many of the topics mentioned.  Simes' writing is a little too punchy; people and policies are mentioned and then abandoned after a couple of sentences, only to be treated several more times later in the book.  No wonder other reviewers complain of difficulty keeping things straight!  From reading this, Simes strikes me as an excellent article writer, but one who has trouble organizing things for more than a few dozen pages.<br />These problems are generally worse in the early chapters of the book than in the later ones that take place after Nixon's death.  Although for a few pages Simes' writing degenerates into pathetic statements like \\"I am sure that he [Nixon] would have agreed... I believe Nixon would also have been nonplussed...\\" (104), he quickly pulls himself together and begins writing in a more serious fashion - less autobiographical, with more notes and slightly better organization.  Simes' obvious dislike of 'Tsar Boris I' and the Clinton administration does not particularly bother me.  After all, I happen to believe that much of his criticism is deserved.<br />So, in conclusion, this book has a lot of good information, but it's not that great.  Besides the problems I've mentioned, a lot has happened in the five years since it was written.  The Asian financial crisis is old news and Yeltsin has actually released the reigns of government.  I am not aware of any better books on the collapse of the Soviet Union and the first decade of post-Soviet Russia, but I'm sure there are some out there.  My suggestion is to pass this book by and keep looking for something better.  If you do feel compelled to read this volume, at least get it from the library.reading this, Simes strikes me as an excellent article writer, but one who has trouble organizing things for more than a few dozen pages.<br />These problems are generally worse in the early chapters of the book than in the later ones that take place after Nixon's death.

In February 1917 its workers, sailors and soldiers overthrew its Tsarist authorities and invested power in a revolutionary Soviet.  In July 1917 a delegation of Kronstadters traveled to Petrograd to join the 'July Days' demonstrations in an unsuccessful attempt to force the Petrograd Soviet to take power as the Kronstadt Soviet had.  Kronstadters took part in the October 1917 coup that brought the Bolsheviks to power.  In January 1918 Kronstadters shut down the Constituent Assembly on Lenin's orders.  And, most famously, in March 1921, the Kronstadters rebelled against Lenin's Bolshevik dictatorship, proclaiming that it had betrayed the Revolution and degenerated into a tyrannical despotism.<br />Much has been written about the 1921 Kronstadt mutiny and its brutal suppression by the Bolsheviks.  However, not much was written about Kronstadt itself, about the new society that the revolutionaries tried to create in 1917, until Israel Getzler's \\"Kronstadt 1917 - 1921: The Fate of a Soviet Democracy\\" was first published twenty years ago.  Unlike most books about Kronstadt, which focus on the 1921 mutiny, Getzler concentrates on Kronstadt's 'golden age' from February 1917 to the early months of 1918.  He investigates in great detail the events at the base and in Petrograd in that year, and takes a long look at the new social and political order constructed by the Kronstadters after February.<br />In brief, Getzler presents a vibrant multi-party Soviet democracy, which flourished in Red Kronstadt from the February Revolution until it was strangled by the Bolsheviks in 1918.  Readers will find his lengthy and detailed descriptions of Soviet elections and sessions either tedious or fascinating; I definitely felt the latter.  Getzler's account of the Civil War years (1918 - 1920) and Kronstadt's 'Third Revolution' are much shorter than his analysis of its golden age.  During the civil war, the Kronstadters were willing to go along with the Bolsheviks and their dictatorship in order to defeat the Counterrevolutionary White armies.  After the end of the Civil War, however, the Kronstadters judged the Bolshevik dictatorship on its own merits, resulting in their catastrophic 1921 revolt.<br />Getzler describes this revolt as the Kronstadters' desperate attempt to restore their Socialist democracy of 1917.  His analysis of the continuity between the 1917 Revolution and the 1921 mutiny (both in terms of ideology and personnel) demolishes the Bolsheviks' dogmatic interpretations of the revolt and their claims that the Kronstadt of 1917 - the 'pride and glory of the Russian Revolution' - was not the same as the 'traitorous and counterrevolutionary' Kronstadt of 1921.  Those who are looking for a more detailed history of the mutiny itself would do well to consult Paul Avrich's \\"Kronstadt, 1921.\\"<br />In the preface to the 1983 edition, Getzler complains that his research was hampered by the unwillingness of the Soviet authorities to grant him access to their archives.  I don't know whether the new 2002 edition of this book includes additional research.  It would be wonderful if Getzler has been able to improve this book with new resources, but even if this is not the case,  \\"Kronstadt 1917 - 1921\\" remains by far the best analysis of Kronstadt's period of multi-party Soviet Socialist democracy in existence.

Well, actually, I read the whole thing right there - it's a quick read, only ~170 pages long with most pages dominated by illustrations.  While reading I was surprised by the amount of information that Ali was able to convey in such a short volume, and how he was able to boil down some complex issues (such as the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk) and summarize them with only a few lines of text.<br />\\"Introducing Trotsky and Marxism\\" is basically a short (and sympathetic) biography of Lev Davidovich \\"Trotsky\\" Bronstein, a major figure in the Russian Revolution and the leader of the Communist opposition to Stalin after Lenin's death.  In an effort to make this a simple introduction, Ali focuses mainly on Trotsky's actions, without spending much time considering his beliefs or philosophy.  Marxism is addressed mainly in its relation to Trotsky's \\"Theory of Permanent Revolution,\\" which deviated from Marxist dogma by claiming that a Socialist revolution could occur in Russia before that country developed democratic organs and went through its Bourgeois/Capitalist \\"stage of development.\\"  This Theory of Permanent Revolution is one of the only theoretical issues addressed by Ali, and his discussion of it is one of the book's weaker sections.<br />Like the rest of the \\"Introducing...\\" series, this book has illustrations on nearly every page, a mix of old photographs and cartoons drawn by Phil Evans.  The text is often interwoven with these illustrations, so that they actually add some substance to the book.  They make \\"Introducing Trotsky and Marxism\\" a quick and easy read - and an amusing one too.  Many of the cartoons are tongue-in-cheek, such as one that reproduces \\"The Last Supper\\" with characters from the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party.  At the end of the book is a useful glossary of the people and organizations that play a role in Trotsky's life and the Russian Revolution.<br />Of course, with all these illustrations this book is incredibly short and over-simplified, and can only give a superficial account of Trotsky's life and his influence on the world.  Don't expect too much from it; it is appropriate for middle school and high school students, or those who only have an hour or so to learn about Trotsky.  Readers who want a more thorough treatment should look at Isaac Deutscher's three-volume biography of Trotsky (\\"The Prophet\\"), Orlando Figes's history of the Russian Revolution (\\"A People's Tragedy\\"), or (naturally) the works of Trotsky himself (\\"The Revolution Betrayed\\" being the most famous).nd organizations that play a role in Trotsky's life and the Russian Revolution.<br />Of course, with all these illustrations this book is incredibly short and over-simplified, and can only give a superficial account of Trotsky's life and his influence on the world.

US	51674257	R1SZWBJUFX1Z0	0872862895	738596071	Anarchism: Left, Right and Green	Books	2	10	10	N	N	A Nice Idea	\\"Anarchism: Left, Right and Green\\" is a nice idea and could have been an excellent book. In it Ulrike Heider attempts a brief survey of three major strands of Anarchism in the United States:<br />(1) Anarcho-syndicalism (Left Anarchism)<br />(2) Libertarianism (Right Anarchism, Anarcho-capitalism)<br />(3) Eco-anarchism (Green Anarchism)<br />In each of these three sections, Heider discusses the writings of important contemporary figures (such as Sam Dolgoff, Noam Chomsky and Murray Bookchin) as well as interviews that she conducted with many of them in the late 1980s. She also provides a bit of historical and theoretical background in each section. In the introduction, Heider stresses that criticism, especially self-criticism, is necessary in order for any philosophy to adapt and evolve. She therefore adopts a critical approach to her subjects - an approach which I can appreciate in the abstract.<br />Although this is a nice idea, \\"Anarchism: Left, Right and Green\\" falls flat. There are many things that I didn't like about it, and I will try to hit on the most important ones. First of all, the book was crippled by its shocking brevity. At ~150 pages, Heider is obviously not going into very much detail at all, considering the vast and interesting topics she is addressing. Most of her biographies of historical figures such as Bakunin and Kropotkin are only a few pages long. Noam Chomsky gets about 10 pages, Sam Dolgoff about 15, Murray Bookchin has about 40, far less than is needed for a thorough introduction to their respective philosophies and writings.<br />This brevity has even worse effects on her critical approach. Heider, a German Anarcho-syndicalist, seems determined to criticize everything in the Right and Green sections of the book - she does criticize the Left Anarchists, but to a lesser degree. However, her criticisms are usually superficial, and occasionally degenerate into nothing more than snide remarks and name-calling. At several points, she subtly denounces her targets as Fascists by (for instance) noting that their words sound \\"frighteningly familiar\\" when translated into German. Constructive criticism is all well and good, but there is very little serious analysis or discussion in the book that that can be put to any useful purpose.<br />Murray Bookchin was so outraged by Heider's treatment of him that he wrote a response, \\"A Meditation on Anarchist Ethics\\" (available online at the Anarchy Archives), defending himself. In it, he accused Heider of selectively quoting his work out of context, misrepresenting his statements and writings, slandering and caricaturing him, and even flat-out lying. This was the first thing I had ever read by Bookchin (being syndicalist myself), and I'm relieved I stumbled across it. It prompted me to increase my suspicions of Heider's criticisms and conclusions and not be so quick to adopt her caricatures of various figures.<br />In addition, several authors have criticized Heider's scholarship, claiming that her footnotes and citations are often incorrect and she occasionally misspells important names that she should know perfectly if she has done any research whatsoever. I have not checked her citations myself, but have little reason to doubt these accusations.<br />I have other, less important criticisms, but will end at this point, in the interest of space and time. I'll conclude by suggesting that \\"Anarchism: Left, Right and Green\\" be read at a library (if possible), if at all. In its place, I suggest Guerin's \\"Anarchism\\" and \\"No Gods, No Masters,\\" which I have not yet read, but have heard good things about.

Even more than that, however, it is a look at the historian's craft, how history is experienced and related, and how history is used in the present.  The book is divided into three parts, which discuss the Boxer Rebellion as Event, Experience and Myth.  The first consists of standard historical writing, a brief survey of the Boxer movement.  It relates important names, dates, ideas and events in a narrative history constructed by the author.<br />The second section, The Boxers as Experience, is more interesting.  Cohen attempts to analyze the experiences of the Boxers, to form a picture of the past.  He looks at various themes, discussing how they shaped the Boxer movement and the attitudes and beliefs of those involved.  Making extensive use of primary documents, he tries to determine their thoughts and feelings regarding foreigners, magic, gender and death.  Of course, Cohen realizes that he cannot fully recount or recreate the experience of the Boxer rebellion, and spends many pages discussing ways historians and writers can approach history to try to understand and explain it.<br />These themes become more fully developed in the book's final section, The Boxers as Myth.  Here Cohen explores the various ways the Boxers have been used as myths in twentieth century China, serving \\"the political, ideological, rhetorical and/or emotional needs\\" of the moment.  While foreigners and the New Culture movement mythologized the Boxers as symbols of Chinese superstition and backwardness, anti-Imperialists cheered their anti-foreignism and nationalism, and cultural revolutionaries idolized their rebelliousness and the mythical role of women in the rebellion.<br />Cohen explores the difference between historians, who attempt to understand and explain the past, and mythologizers, who try to use history to advance an agenda in the present.  He discusses the process of myth-making, in which contexts and inconvenient facts are ignored and a one-dimensional 'history' in created through distortion and oversimplification.  Still, Cohen has some respect for mythologizing the past, and notes that experience itself is \\"processed\\" in terms of culture and myth.  \\"Mythic constructions are ubiquitous in the world of experience and form an inseparable part of it.\\"<br />I was assigned part of this book in a history course on nineteenth century globalization, but ended up reading the whole thing - and I'm glad I did.  In addition to giving an excellent history of the Boxer Rebellion, \\"History in Three Keys\\" contains valuable insights into more recent Chinese history and development.  Even more valuable are the discussions about the nature of history, myth, historical writing and the historian's craft.  It is well written, clear and engaging, with extensive notes, index and bibliography.  I enjoyed it immensely and recommend it to all interested in Chinese history or historical writing in general.process of myth-making, in which contexts and inconvenient facts are ignored and a one-dimensional 'history' in created through distortion and oversimplification.

The book follows (through a long series of incarnations) a small cast of characters struggling to create a just and peaceful world.  The angry and aggressive K____, the more spiritual tagalong B_____, the studious and intellectual I_____ and some others reappear throughout the book, each exhibiting the same fundamental character, with differences of culture and situation flavoring their actions.<br />\\"The Years of Rice and Salt\\" is technically an alternate history in which disease wipes out all of Europe and most of Christendom in the late middle ages.  Unlike writers such as Turtledove, Robinson doesn't feel compelled to relate everything that happens, but focuses only on certain incarnations of the main characters.  This is refreshing, but sometimes makes it difficult to figure out what happened in the world and when (since he uses mainly the lunar Islamic calendar).  In the end, this world is remarkably similar to our own, which is somewhat implausible but not fatally so.<br />Problems begin to appear roughly halfway through the book, however, at which point the plot stalls and seems to lose focus.  The characters' quest for justice in buried beneath the details of their lives and geopolitical developments.  In one incarnation, K_____ joins an underground organization conspiring to free Japan from Chinese rule.  Nothing else happens during that incarnation - he simply joins the organization.  In another, all three characters fight in a devastating World War and talk about how it all went wrong.  While I can appreciate the Robinson's apparent desire to illustrate the difficulty and contradictions inherent in changing the world by force, I wish he could have done so without halting plot development.  The several hundred pages in which little progress is made (in the plot or the world) eventually became downright tedious, despite decent writing throughout.<br />And so ultimately I was disappointed by \\"The Years of Rice and Salt,\\" which got off to a wonderful start but then seemed to fall apart.  Although the last couple of chapters tried to get the story back on track, it was too little, too late.  I was also left cold by the ending: there wasn't one; the cycle of reincarnations just continued.  If this book seems interesting, I encourage you to read it, but suggest you consider checking it out from the library.(in the plot or the world) eventually became downright tedious, despite decent writing throughout.<br />And so ultimately I was disappointed by \\"The Years of Rice and Salt,\\" which got off to a wonderful start but then seemed to fall apart.

This edition includes two new chapters as well as extensive endnotes that do much to perfect the original text and correct the few mistakes that were found in it. \\"The Selfish Gene\\" is explicitly directed at the layman, and absolutely no knowledge of biology is assumed.  While this presents a danger of boring readers (such as myself) who are already familiar with DNA and meiosis, the colorful metaphors Dawkins uses throughout the book do much to keep the reading engrossing and entertaining.<br />After a lengthy exploration of basic biology, covering topics such as DNA and the origin of life, Dawkins introduces the gene-centered view of evolution that has long been textbook orthodoxy.  Dawkins uses the remainder of the book to look at various types of animal behavior in an effort to convey some general conclusions and tools to help the reader understand evolution and natural selection.  Much of his effort is devoted to explaining behavior in terms of the 'selfish gene' - especially social behavior that has long been held to have evolved 'for the good of the species.'  Dawkins shows that how fundamental axiom of natural selection (that the genes best at surviving and reproducing will eventually spread through the gene pool) leads directly to the selfish gene and the behavior exhibited by nearly all animals (humans being the prime exception).<br />Many of Dawkins's metaphors have caused raised eyebrows - one outstanding example is his characterization of living things as \\"lumbering robots\\" built to protect the genes that hide in them - but the metaphors are always (eventually) brought under control.  The title is one such metaphor that has often been misunderstood by superficial analysis.  The 'selfish gene' is simply a gene that does not aid others at its own expense.  Such genes would be better able to reproduce and spread through the gene pool than those that did sacrifice themselves for others, and therefore completely dominate the gene pools of all species as a result of billions of years of evolutionary pressure.<br />I cannot hope to adequately summarize Dawkins's arguments in a mere review, so I sincerely urge you to read \\"The Selfish Gene\\" for yourself.  I should warn that conservatives would probably  not enjoy the book nearly as much as I did.  Dawkins is an open secular humanist with socialist leanings, and is not worried about offending the delicate sensibilities of creationists and fundamentalists.  This book should only be read by those willing to 'accept' the validity of natural selection and evolution; others would only waste their time.  I would direct readers seeking a more scientific discussion of these issues to G. C. Williams's \\"Adaptation and Natural Selection.\\"  All others will most likely enjoy \\"The Selfish Gene\\" a great deal and finish the book with a new appreciation for and understanding of evolution and biology.gh the gene pool than those that did sacrifice themselves for others, and therefore completely dominate the gene pools of all species as a result of billions of years of evolutionary pressure.<br />I cannot hope to adequately summarize Dawkins's arguments in a mere review, so I sincerely urge you to read \\"The Selfish Gene\\" for yourself.

As should come as no surprise to readers familiar with Dr. Zinn's writing and opinions, he denounces all three events, arguing that while the events of September 11th were horrible atrocities, killing people around the world in a potentially endless war (whose targets currently include residents of Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and many other countries) is no solution - and quite possibly could simply exacerbate the problem. Altogether convinced that \\"we must do something\\" to respond to 9/11, he is just as certain that we must not respond with bombs and war.<br />What I appreciated more than the arguments made for this case (which can be found in the literature of any self-respecting progressive or anti-war organization) are the chances that the questioner gives Dr. Zinn to explain his personal views on various aspects of war, pacifism, patriotism, civil liberties and politics, both in the present day and throughout history. As a veteran of the \\"Good War\\" who has come to believe that there is no such thing as a 'good war,' Zinn explains the reasoning that lead him to this conclusion, demonstrating warfare's inability to improve the world and discussing viable alternatives to mass killing.<br />In this well-organized publication, Zinn is also able to fire back at attackers who have accused him (and others) of \\"blaming America first\\" (a reference to the 1940s pseudofascist pro-Nazi organization 'America First').  Comparing this to the tactics used by McCarthyists in the 1950s, he illustrates how it is just a part of a largely successful effort to intimidate, marginalize and silence any who may be opposed to war or simply want to examine the roots of terrorism and \\"why they hate us\\". Neither Dr. Zinn nor this book are anti-American in any way; no one should be frightened away by any such baseless accusations.<br />All in all, this slim volume contains far more worthwhile discussion than I can summarize here. From optimism and alternatives for the future to America's historical support for global terrorism and anti-democratic forces, Dr. Zinn's considerable historical knowledge and capacity for critical analysis emanates from every page. Dozens of reference notes have been added by the editor to the text of the interviews, and the book includes a useful index, bibliography, and contact information for a variety of anti-war and alternative information sources. Excerpts from the Geneva Protocols are also included in an appendix.

So he heads off to the capitalist world of Urras - the historical home of his people from which they fled into self-imposed exile nearly 200 years earlier - in order to trade the extremely powerful \\"Grand Temporal Theory\\" that exists only in his head for a chance to forge connections between the people of Urras and the anarchists of nearby Annares.<br />However, being an anarchist, Shevek is not a very good trader.  He quickly finds himself trapped in an invisible prison, carefully isolated from the restless masses of Urras, while the leaders of Urras try to get the Grand Temporal Theory from him in order to establish their rule over the entirety of known space.  Breaking out of his luxurious jail, Shevek  joins up with socialist revolutionaries and tries to make sure his life's work is not misused.<br />\\"The Dispossessed\\" is written in an interesting fashion, with flashbacks covering the course of Shevek's life routinely interrupting the narrative.  While some might be annoyed by the story's resulting disjointedness, I personally was not bothered.  The flashbacks let Le Guin explore her ideas of how an anarchist society would operate, how life, love and politics would work in a government-less world.  For me, being able to explore the conflicts and tensions between society and the individual, between centralization and autonomy, between responsibility and freedom - this proved nearly as interesting as the plot itself.<br />Although \\"The Dispossessed\\" is technically a work of science fiction, it seems to be primarily an exploration of society and the human spirit.  The physics that forms the base of the plot is presented more as philosophy than hard science and the level of technology on Urras and Annares seems hardly more advanced than what exists today.  Overall, this book has excellent characters, a good plot, and a whole approach that is sure to make you think about government, society, and humanity itself.  Five stars.ists today.

The result is not a book for those who lack either time or commitment.  With 922 history-packed pages, \\"History of the World\\" is a book that cannot be read in any short amount of time.<br />However, I did have a couple of problems with Roberts' work.  For one thing, Europe clearly occupies the central role in the narrative.  The entire precolonial histories of India and China receive only 15 and 17 pages in this book, respectively.  The mere 400 years of Western Europe's \\"Dark Ages\\" (AD700 - 1100) on the other hand, are discussed over 25 pages.  While some amount of Eurocentrism in a historical work can be forgiven due to Europe's global domination in recent centuries, discrepancies such as this one seem excessive, to say the least.  Roberts' book at its worst moments seems to be a history of Europe with occasional chapters on the rest of the world tossed in at the appropriate times, as opposed to a balanced history of the world.<br />I was also mildly irritated by some of the illustrations and maps which appear in the \\"History of the World.\\"  The artwork and photographs were generally related to the text, although they didn't add much to the narrative.  Some, however, were completely random.  Why would someone include Byzantine art with a discussion of Japan's Meiji Restoration?  The maps were usually of decent quality, though many were cramped and hard to read.  Some of these also appeared to be included in the book as afterthoughts.  I'll supply one example: a map detailing the spread of Muslim rule in India accompanies a discussion of the Indian Mauryan Empire, which rose and fell centuries before the founding of Islam.  Some readers may not be bothered by these rather slight annoyances; others may be irritated, as I was.<br />Ultimately, though, the central dilemma of Roberts' \\"History of the World\\" is its very nature.  Trying to write a one-volume history of the world seems an act of almost foolhardy ambition.  The end result packs in so much history that it is too imposing to be of use as an introductory reading, but at the same time is not able to go 'deep' enough to please history buffs (who will likely know most of what they read).  To put it simply, I don't think that super-large one-volume histories are the best way to read (or write) history.  Although Roberts' work is certainly impressive, I would recommend that readers seek out more in-depth works on more specific historical topics instead of devoting themselves to this \\"History of the World.\\"  Three stars.l dilemma of Roberts' \\"History of the World\\" is its very nature.

Unlike these three books, \\"Beyond Civilization\\" is non-fiction, a collection of short essays in which Quinn clarifies some of the ideas from the Ishmael Trilogy and responds to questions posed by readers and critics. A bibliography and thematic index for all four books are also extremely helpful resources for Quinn readers.<br />The essays that make up this book deal with varied topics - from school shootings to what it means to \\"save the world.\\" However, they are all connected in their criticisms of 'civilized' society and support for a \\"new tribalism.\\" The concept of the New Tribal Revolution occupies a large part of \\"Beyond Civilization,\\" and it is a complex topic to try to summarize. Basically, new tribalism calls for the immediate creation of a non-ethnic tribal society in which the ravages of civilization - both ecological and social - can be minimized. It should be emphasized that Quinn is NOT a primitivist or Luddite, as some claim. He calls not for the destruction of knowledge and technology, but rather urges people to use them in a different and (in his view) better fashion. New Tribalism is not a return to the past - it is an effort to go beyond civilization and 'save the world' from environmental disaster and social self-destruction.<br />Many reviewers have criticized Quinn's somewhat vague instructions regarding what they should do to go beyond civilization.  The lack of a clear program did not bother me too much - for one thing, it will help prevent dogmatism in any movement seeking to go beyond civilization.  Readers, in my opinion, should not expect any new culture to spring fully-formed from Quinn's pen.  Life and society beyond civilization will evolve into forms that work well; it will not be arbitrarily created.<br />\\"Beyond Civilization\\" is structured as a collection of straightforward essays written in the first person and addressed directly to the reader.  All of the essays are less than one page long and they can be read all at once, or slowly and reflectively over a number of days. Was the book written in a condescending fashion, as some reviewers have complained?  I personally don't think so - Quinn does his best to be engaging and argumentative, which may not go across well with some readers.<br />Agree with Quinn or not, you will find \\"Beyond Civilization\\" captivating and perhaps even inspirational. You will return to it time and again, drawn by its analysis of civilization, tribalism, and humanity itself. Highly recommended.ilization\\" is structured as a collection of straightforward essays written in the first person and addressed directly to the reader.

The book is a detailed history of the Kronstadt 'mutiny' of March 1921, in which many see the seeds of Stalin's future dictatorship.<br />Basically, what happened is this: following a wave of strikes and discontent in Russia caused by the repressive methods of \\"War Communism,\\" the sailors at the Kronstadt naval base in the Baltic Sea published a document proposing the deconstruction of the Bolshevik Party's single-Party Dictatorship (if not necessarily the Party itself). The Bolsheviks responded by attacking the base and executing those behind this 'mutiny.' Since 1921, there has been a continuing debate between Leninists and anarchists/libertarian socialists as to whether this constituted a betrayal of the principles of socialism and the ideals of the Russian Revolution.<br />The Leninists claim that the Kronstadters were mutineers who needed to be \\"crushed by the iron hand of the proletariat.\\" The anarchists and libertarian socialists hold that it was the Bolshevik Party itself that betrayed the Revolution and laid the base of Stalin's purges, gulags, and authoritarian dictatorship by attacking the base Leon Trotsky had once called \\"the Pride and Glory of the Russian Revolution.\\"<br />As a result of this lasting antagonism, most histories of the uprising tend to be slanted in favor of one side or the other - but Paul Avrich here makes an attempt to cut through the partisan wrangling and establish the factual history of the base once and for all. He reaches the conclusion that the Bolsheviks reacted to Kronstadt's challenge to their authority with unnecessary intransigence and brutality, but does mention the pressures of the Russian Civil War of 1918 - 1920 to help explain their actions. Mr. Avrich also rips apart much of the official propaganda surrounding the myth of Kronstadt (for example, that the mutiny was organized and led by a Tsarist General).<br />\\"Kronstadt, 1921\\" is a well-written account of one of the most important and interesting events in the history of the Russian Revolution and the formation of the Stalinist Soviet Union. Recommended reading for anyone interested in Russia or its history.

Alexander starts out decently - in the prologue he states how he believes Hitler could have won the war (by focusing on North Africa and the Middle East and not attacking Russia).  After that, however, things go downhill.<br />The bulk of _How Hitler Could Have Won World War II_ is a survey of the war itself, from the invasion of France to Germany's surrender.  During parts of the narrative, there are connections made to the book's subtitle: \\"The Fatal Errors That Led To Nazi Defeat.\\"  Alexander takes a critical look at many of Hitler's military decisions, especially those that brought him into conflict with his generals.  Although these \\"fatal mistakes\\" are mentioned, not much more is said about how Hitler could have won World War II.<br />Even as a history of the war, Alexander's book doesn't stand up very well.  It is short (300 pages paperback) and is only able to give a cursory glance at much of what went on in the European theater.  The Pacific theater is ignored.  Alexander tends to focus disproportionately on events in North Africa and Italy, without giving the other fronts all the attention they deserve.  This could be excusable if he used the opportunity to elaborate on his theory of how Hitler could have won - but unfortunately he does not.<br />Personally, I felt that _How Hitler Could Have Won World War II_ was a decent book, but I felt it could have been better.  It takes shape as little more than a brief history of World War II, and there are other books that do a much better job with that topic (like _The Second World War_ by John Keegan).  This book strikes me as one that should be borrowed from the library and read; if I were able to do it all over again, I probably wouldn't choose to buy it.	2002-03-11

This is the reasoning behind Quinn's choice of a gorilla named Ishmael as the main character of this novel, who conducts a series of dialogues analyzing the whole of civilization itself.<br />But what is the civilization that Quinn looks at? Instead of muttering about monumental building and written language, Quinn treats civilization in a method that is becoming increasingly popular: as the result of a critical mass of humanity that makes possible rapid advances in knowledge and science. For this to be possible, intensive agriculture must be used to raise the population density to such a point that civilization occurs.<br />So Quinn uses a gorilla as an outsider looking in and perceiving the reality of civilization - of cultures using intensive agriculture to dominate the world.  His conclusions are for the most part negative: he concludes that civilization is not sustainable in the long term (that is, over millions of years).<br />The observations used to come to this conclusion are relatively well-known; that civilization is the greatest disaster to befall earth in the past 65 million years.  In terms of pollution, deforestation, extinction, and overall negative impact to the web of life itself, humanity is supreme among all the species.  What Quinn does not share with the others who know these facts is a belief that civilization will overcome any difficulties it encounters.  Civilization, to Quinn, is the problem, not the solution.<br />_Ishmael_ is the presentation of these ideas in a Socratic method from a gorilla to a man &quot;with an earnest desire to save the world.&quot;  There isn't really any plot to this book, nor does Quinn intend there to be.  The disappearance of Ishmael at the end of book is the only story-like element in _Ishmael_, and it is really an attempt by Quinn to set the reader free - to encourage him/her to think about civilization for himself rather than be told about it by a telepathic gorilla.  I've always had the feeling that this should be considered nonfiction, rather than a story.<br />The problem presented by _Ishmael_ is simple: civilization is the problem.  The solution is both simple and complex: in order to preserve a human niche in the ecosystem, we must go beyond civilization.  Working to figure out just what this means is one of the great joys of reading _Ishmael_, whether or not you agree with Quinn's assessment of the situation.  _Ishmael_ is a book that will make you look around and think, and perhaps reach some conclusions that you may find surprising.

Upon reflection, it seems to me that the author only used Che in order to increase sales of his book - the political philosophy that the book extols has little in common with that of Che.<br />The basic background is this: following defeats in the Congo and Bolivia, Che Guevara gives up revolution and wanders around Latin America for 32 years, finally returning to Cuba with a new non-violent revolutionary philosophy. This new philosophy is based on the concept of the polis - the autonomous Greek city-state - and focuses mainly on increased local control for loosely-confederated communities. \\"Blackthorn\\" traces the development of the idea in this way: Greece (\\"Pericles or somebody else\\"); Rome; Machiavelli; Thomas Jefferson. I cannot accept Che (probably the most radical leader of the Cuban revolution) ignoring the innate injustice of the sketchy philosophy which is presented in the story.<br />What the author appears to ignore is the fact that these city-states upon which this \\"true republic\\" is based are just as unequal and oppresive as modern capitalist societies - maybe more so. In the most democratic polis, only the rich males were allowed to choose their leaders, with all women and foreigners viewed as sub-human. Pericles himself, the founder of this ideal (according to Blackthorn) was the original genocidal demagogue, who launched wars for an Athenian empire and exterminated native Mediterrranean populations to make way for Greek colonies. Other city-states were ruled by dictators, absolute monarchs, or even theocracies. This political form does nothing to strike at the injustice that Che Guevara gave his life to eliminate. I won't address Machiavelli's views, the corruption and oppressive class nature of the Roman Republic, or Jefferson's life as a slave-owning aristocrat.<br />Had this book created a new character to present Blackthorn's views, it would have recieved a much higher rating from me - I honestly enjoyed the author's jabs at our modern political systems. As it is, I see Blackthorn using (and abusing) the memory of a beloved freedom fighter in order to make money, and I can barely refrain from giving him the lowest possible rating.<br />Don't buy this book if you are interested in learning about Che Guevara or already know about his life and beliefs. If, however, you simply want to chuckle about auction-block politics - go ahead and read it. Just don't associate the \\"true republic\\" with Che.fferson's life as a slave-owning aristocrat.<br />Had this book created a new character to present Blackthorn's views, it would have recieved a much higher rating from me - I honestly enjoyed the author's jabs at our modern political systems.
