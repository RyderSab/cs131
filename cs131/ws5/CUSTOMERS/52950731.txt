A brief summary of the contents:<br /><br />- An overview and timeline of the legendary Trojan war including notes and options for running a Trojan War campaign.<br /><br />- New character classes, spells, artifacts, and creatures drawn from the Greek Age of Mythology<br /><br />- Game stats for all the personalities of the Trojan War (Achilles, Hector, Paris, the gang is all here..)<br /><br />Overall, the book is excellent - well-researched and packed cover-to-cover with details. Especially well done is the concise summary of the Trojan War from the events preceeding the war to the aftermath. The section on the Divine Offspring characters is also useful given that just about any personality in Homeric Greece worthy of note is the son/daughter of some diety or other. GMs who intend to allow the PCs change the course of saga will find helpful the \\"What If\\" section detaling alternative resolutions for the war.<br /><br />About the only minor blot I can bring up is that some of the stats are not particularly true to their descriptions in the myths (Agamemnon - who sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia to placate the goddess Athena - is Lawful Good?).	2004-12-11

Precious few modern writers concentrate their efforts on pure, escapist fantasy so often mercilessly derided by oh-so-intellectual book reviewers. Happily, if you want to let the inner munchkin out (the one who cheers as the hero scythes through legions of opponents), then David Gemmell's books are a fine place to start - where the warriors are always heroic (despite whatever other character flaws they may have), magic is powerful, and epic battles scar the landscape.<br />This book is a prequel to &quot;Legend&quot; (another favourite Gemmell book) and delves into the making of the hero featured in the author's earlier book, Druss the Legend. Beginning at Druss childhood, the book traces the early life of the Drenai hero who has death brought to him when raiders attack his village, carrying off his bride. Druss, the man who was not brave enough to be a farmer, takes his grandfather's infamous axe Snaga and set out to get her back, and in the process became a legend in his own time. All the good stuff is here: an unyielding hero, honor, courage, huge battle scenes, fearsome opponents, dark magic, and a wicked witch all described in Gemmell's crisp prose. Robert E. Howard - the creator of Conan - would have approved.	2004-05-18

Overall the book is very well done, providing interesting adventure hooks and details to bring the people, customs, and cities in the Threshold to life. The chapter on Nexus is especially well done with lots of adventure ideas and will be useful for GMs who plan to take their games there.<br />The only con is that there are no maps provided (except one for the Scavenger lands in Chapter 5) and you will have to rely on the maps that came with the main Exalted rulebook.<br />The chapters are:<br />Ch1: The North.<br />Descrbes the frozen lands north of the Blessed Isle and its people, customs and cities. Includes details of the Haslanti League (a loose confederation of city-states on the shores of the White Sea), iceships and airboats.<br />Ch2: The East<br />Describes the lands to the East of the Blessed Isle, but deals mostly with the areas outside of the Scavenger Lands proper which has its own chapter. There is a detailed section on the Sijan the city of the dead, and sections on the people, customs and creatures of the forest lands.<br />Ch3: The South.<br />Describes the cities and inhabitants of Gem, Chiaroscuro, the Varang City-States, Harborhead, and the surrounding lands. Nexus is described in a separate chapter. There are notes on Firedust and weapons (e.g. Firewands) using this unique substance.<br />Ch4: The West<br />Details the islands of the West, including Wavecrest, Coral , Skullstone, and the dreaded Lintha pirate family.<br />Ch5: The Scavenger Lands<br />Describes the so-called Scavenger Lands and includes a detailed history of the River Province. The cities of Lookshy, Great Forks, Sijan, Greyfalls, and Denandsor are described in some detail. A separate section deals with the unique creatures of Mount Metagalapa (hawkriders,birdmen, and great rocs).<br />Ch6: Nexus<br />An in-depth description of the teeming megapolis of Nexus which includes descriptions of the surrounding lands, laws, the council, the guild, and the various districts and neighborhoods. A separate section details the First Age Tombs of the Exalted in Nexus, complete with their deadly traps.<br />Appendix1: Groups and Organisations<br />Describes the various power factions in the Threshold including the Guild and the Children of the Wyld in greater detail.<br />Appendix2: The Fair Folk<br />A thorough discussion on the Fair Folk. This chapter covers the varieties of Fair Folk and their unique powers (Glamour) done in much greater detail than the sections in the main Exalted rulebook.pth description of the teeming megapolis of Nexus which includes descriptions of the surrounding lands, laws, the council, the guild, and the various districts and neighborhoods.

A very interesting and novel idea that for the first chapter was told very well and had me entralled. However, the remaining parts of the book deteriorates into mediocrity and culminates in a \\"war of the gods\\" scenario that to me, greatly spoils whatever promise the idea originally had. Of course, a big part of any graphic novel is the art itself: A great cover painting, but the art within is good in parts but mostly average.<br />In summary, a promising and very original idea, but the story and art does not completely deliver. It really could have been much better.	2003-11-27

The stories were classics: a rich storyline, great action and some truly outstanding art by Mike McMahon.<br />This book is Part Two (of Two) of the Horned God series and teams up Pat Mills, the original creator of the Slaine series with the awesomely talented Simon Bisley. There were several earlier printings of The Horned God story and to my knowledge all of them are out of print and have become collector items of value. This latest printing splits the tale into two books, the first part of which is ISBN 1840234776.<br />In this story, the wandering Slaine has at last returned to his tribe, the Sessair to lead them as king. To defeat their dreaded foes the Drunes and their sea-devil allies the Fomors, Slaine sets out to unite the individual tribes and bring together all four of the great treasures of Tir Nan Og: The sword of the moon which can cut through any metal, the spear of Lugh which thirsts for blood, the cauldron of blood which never empties of food, and the stone of kingship whose test the High King must pass to be accepted by the tribes.<br />In Part Two of this tale, Slaine has gathered all the treasures but one and sets out to finish the task and confront the age-old enemies of his people, the Drunes. The rich, well-researched story and the humour that was so much a part of the original strips are all retained. Combined with Bisley's incredible full-colour artwork makes this the possibly the best of the 2000 AD offerings currently in print.	2003-08-11

The Dawn Caste of Celetial Exalted are the ultimate warriors in the Exalted Game world and this book explores the many facets of playing one.<br />The first section describes the views and motivations of several of these superhumans. The stories are varied enough that they never become repetitive and make great inspirational reading for those players planning on coming up with character backgrounds. It was fun reading how the sample characters dealt with their sudden transformation to demi-god status and how it affected their views of the world.<br />The second section details what the sample Exalted think the other factions and powers in the Exalted World and vice versa: Normal mortals, other Exalted, and the Fair Folk. It is interesting to read how some folk view these superhuman warriors as demi-gods and form cults around them. From a Storyteller's perspective I can see a lot of potential for challenging situations for Dawn PCs in these notes.<br />In the last section are many new charms (the great majority are combat-related of course) for the Dawn player and new artifacts (hearthstones and weapons) for the warriors to dream of.<br /><br />Like many books in the Exalted series, the typos are present. They are irritating but do not take any fun out of reading.	2003-07-01

Solars, Lunars, Dragon-Blooded, and Abyssals, there is probably a little bit of everything for everyone. There are several paragraphs covering each of the factions and a small section of additional charms to try out. But would you even want to bother with the snippets here merely to whet your appetite until the full supplements for the factions are released?<br />Also, since this is supposed to be a Storytellers Companion, I was pretty surprised not to find a hefty section on running games and campaigns. Dock 1 star there. The nifty storyteller's screen packaged with the book is useful and seems to work well for the few game sessions I ran. In the introduction, the book also mentions a full-color map that was supposed to be included in the book, but don't bother looking for it.<br />In summary: Nice but not essential, and left out a lot of the cooler stuff for the supplements. I would recommend buying the full supplement for your favourite faction(s) instead.	2003-06-06

The mechanics of the rules are based on White Wolf's storytelling system used in their other games like Vampire and Werewolf.<br />The story behind the game is that certain exceptional people in the Exalted game world of Creation are selected by the Heavens and granted a spark of divinity in a process known as Exaltation. These former mortals (called Exalted) have the ability to manipulate the energy - Essence - that flow through all of Creation channelling it to power their Charms and Sorceries. Charms tend to be action-oriented moves of limited effect (just think of them as Special Attacks) whereas Sorcery produces much more powerful effects but takes longer to prepare. Since their abilities were exceptional to begin with, coupled with the additional power of Charms and Sorcery, even a starting character will have more than enough power to make just about any number of mortal enemies flee like frightened rabbits (very satisfying). The ability to use essence is limited, but while it lasts, players can throw trees around, leap onto the roof of buildings from a standing jump, and slay a dozen foes each round.<br />This book does just about everything right: it is beautifully produced and bound (many expensive rulebooks come apart with regular gaming) with a hefty chunk of details on the geography and politics, and a large section on character creation including the very cool charms and sorcery. But truly the best part about this game is that it is written with such flair and passion that makes the gamer want to try it out at once.<br />The only (minor) faults I can find is that a sample adventure was not included and some of the illustrations are not particularly inspiring. Highly recommended if you have any interest in heroic fantasy on a epic scale. And PC gamers, if you have ever wanted to visit the excitement of Squaresoft's Final Fantasy series, this game is your ticket.isit the excitement of Squaresoft's Final Fantasy series, this game is your ticket.	2003-06-06

Awaiting trial under the care of the poisoner Abe who plots to kill him still, Retsudo summons the 'Grass' in a final attempt to change his fate - ninja infiltrators hidden for generations among the Samurai families all over Japan. Duty, the main tenet of Bushido is evident in the way the ninja obediently destroy all traces of their former lives (and in some cases, their offspring as well) as farmers, soldiers, and priests, to answer Retsudo's call to arms. Elsewhere, Ogami Itto patiently awaits his promised duel with Retsudo while teaching son Diagoro what it means to wield the sword of the Samurai.<br />Having followed the saga of Ogami Itto and his son Diagoro since book #1, I must say the stories keep getting better and better. While there is less of the violent physical encounters that characterized Itto's earlier adventures, the tales depicted in the book are no less gripping. I particularly liked the focus on the other major character of the series, Itto's nemesis Yagyu Retsudo. One could almost admire the man for his tenacity, honour, and Bushido spirit, despite his ruthlessness.	2002-12-29

Retsudo with the aid of his ninja infiltrators, cunningly traps Abe in a strategem that results in the master poisoner being ordered to commit seppuku (ritual belly cutting) by the enraged Shogun. Meanwhile, Ogami Itto, goes to find Retsudo by simply walking into Edo Castle in the midst of a festival, depending on his bearing and charisma instead of his sword. The best of the tales is probably the sad end of Abe Tanoshi. The master poisoner disgraces his own seppuku ceremony by his refusal to accept his fate until Ogami Itto intervenes. At the end of his life, Abe finally learns a little of what it means to be bushi.<br />Great stuff - Powerful storytelling and stark visuals with few restraints, but you would expect no less of the Lone Wolf and Cub series.	2002-12-29

Written by two veteran Traveller authors, the attention to detail is refreshing in a gaming supplement. The mercenary's life is thoroughly described in the main text and typical of the GURPS products, spiced up with lots of interesting snippets on the sidebars. New templates and new equipment will be of interest to players keen on dishing out (as mentioned in the preface) &quot;Grade-A violence to all comers&quot;. The only (minor) fault I could find is that the sample characters are not particularly inspiring.<br />The original Mercenary book was arguably the most exciting of the supplements published by the now-closed Game Designers Workshop when I first started playing Traveller. This new version for GURPS Traveller is even better. Easily the first supplement I would get for the GURPS Traveller system.	2002-12-24

Itto Ogami, a ronin's ronin takes up the way of the assassin to avenge the treachery of a rival clan. Along the long journey to vengeance, the swords flash thick and fast as master swordsman Ogami leaves a growing trail of blood and corpses wherever he roams. Be warned that all the gory details of mortal combat are captured with little restraint. However, the gore is there simply to tell the story and Kazuo Koike to his credit never lets the stories descend into a mindless gorefest. The combat is gory, but the characters, the culture, and the background feel real as well.<br />Unlike the first english version of this series (by First comics), the translations are much better done. While historical accuracy has to make way for dramatic license, enough is retained that brings to life the culture and people of shogun-era Japan. A big plus is the glossary and notes at the back of the book which allow readers unfamiliar with feudal Japan to gain a better understanding of the times the stories are set in. Complimented by a terrific cover by Frank Miller.	2001-06-08

The accuracy of these details comes as no surprise as the author was once the Dutch ambassador to China. Highly recommended for fans of classic stories of deduction.	2001-06-08

Less impressive are the discussions on the role and tactics of the Tiger tank in combat. One plus is the many rare and unusual photographs in the book, some of which I have not seen anywhere else.<br />But I have to mention that the accompanying illustrations are few and rather poorly done. I would have liked more and better illustrations since the b/w photographs don't really show the different paint schemes and markings well. Also, the description of the Tiger's armament is too brief - there are no detailed pictures of the 88mm gun or the different ammuntion types.<br />Overall it would be a good buy as a first book but if you already have books on the topic, there probably won't be anything new here except perhaps the excellently done history and development of the Tiger.	2001-04-05

Lewis:<br />&quot;Of all tyrannies a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.&quot;<br />This book contains ludicrous statements, poorly researched theories, and emotional outbursts. While I'm sure the author is totally convinced of the 'truth' as she states so clearly (and loudly), it would take much more objective reporting to convince anybody with even half a brain of the points raised. One gets the feeling that the author feels intensely that Dungeons and Dragons is 'evil' but is unable to substantiate it and thus is forced to piece together 'evidence' of such shaky nature that it would be laughed at if the allegations were not so serious. I usually enjoy reading books that can present good arguments about controversial topics but not this one. The only redeeming feature of this book is the cover is quite nice. Unfortunately the pages inside are a complete waste of the trees that were slaughtered to provide the pulp.	2000-08-24

A comprehensive  history is provided of the FW-190 from its design stages up until the last  days of the war. The highlight of the book is the superb color plates of  more than a dozen FW-190 variants clearly showing color schemes and unit  markings at various times in the war that make this book perfect for any  scale modeller.<br />The only thing that prevented me from giving this book a  5-star was twofold. There are no interviews from ex-pilots (some of whom  are still with us). Also there is a glaring lack of basic technical  information (speed, dimensions, armament) on the FW-190 and its variants.  Some technical information can be gleaned from the text but it is  incomplete. In short, if you are a scale modeller keen on FW-190 markings,  you will be overjoyed with this book. Otherwise it is still a good read,  just not great.	2000-08-04

Also  included are personal experiences of ex-pilots and plenty of b/w  photographs (some of which I haven't seen elsewhere). I especially liked  the interviews with the main people from the original FW-190 design team  (including Kurt Tank, the 'father' of the FW-190) which provides a rare  look at the thoughts and objectives of the fighter's designers.<br />Overall,  there is lots of well-organized information and the book should satisfy all  but the most demanding aviation enthusiasts.

As somebody with a great interest in Oriental history and mythology, I had looked forward to this  book - at least until I read it, that is. There are some interesting ideas  here but the  tale is so poorly told that I found myself fighting to  sustain interest in finishing it.<br />Granted that suspension of disbelief  is required to enjoy stories of this type (which are more in keeping with  Japanese folklore than actual historical records), the story should at  least have tried to keep some semblance of realism. Nowhere in sight are  the warring clans and the famous ninja families. I can accept - and even  expect - unreal levels of weapon skills and semi-mystical ninja powers, but  this particular story reads like a long fairy tale. The writing is  amatuerish and the terrible illustrations did nothing to salvage it.<br />One  redeeming feature is the interesting items of ninja equipment used, but  nothing from which you can't get from say, Stephen K. Hayes' excellent  series of books on Ninja history and tradition. To all that, add the fact  that the book is very thin for the high price charged and you have no  reason to bother, unless you wish to own everything that has the word  'ninja' stamped on it...	2000-07-26

What we have here is the chronicle of a young boy's flight from an  evil ninja master who destroyed his clan. Stereotypical plots are fine  except that the tale is told so poorly that it kills any interest the  reader may have in the first few paragraphs alone.<br />Granted that some  suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy stories of this type (which I  do), the story should at least have tried to keep some semblance of  realism.

The prose is clumbersome and the terrible illustrations did  nothing to salvage it. The sole redeeming feature is that there are several  interesting items of ninja equipment used (briefly). But if ninja equipment  is what you are after, I'd pass over this book in favour of Stephen K.  Hayes' excellent series of books on Ninja history and tradition.	2000-07-20

As a veteran gamer who probably has more supplements than should be healthy, I found this book to be  readable and a good addition for any GM who plans to take his players into  the Underdark.<br />While the essays, descriptions and artwork are perfectly  functional, the style is a little dry and lacking in excitement. It would  probably have read better if the author had adopted a first-person  perspective - after all, the title is 'Drizzt's Guide to the Underdark' -  and doesn't quite match up to R.A.

A  welcome surprise for a TSR supplement is the terrific illustrations that  compliment the text. While gun enthusiasts might be unsatisfied with the  generic weapons offered (e.g. '9mm Semi automatic' as opposed to say, '9mm  Browning HP'), the detail should be sufficient for most players and GMs.  Overall, it is very well done and well worth the price.	2000-05-30

The adventure, set in the small town of Bogenhafen has been described by its authors as a 'Call  of Cthulhu' scenario. This means investigation, conspiracies, secret cults,  and fateful summonings. Above all, it encourages roleplay since there is a  bare minumum of violent action.<br />While many Warhammer FRP veterans enjoy  this adventure and rate it highly, I prefer a more balanced style of  adventure design. As it is written, the game features a lot of  investigation and interaction, and almost no action. However if your group  is fortunate enough to consist of players who prefer roleplay over combat,  add one star - this adventure is made for you. Players with way too many  weapon specialization skills would probably be unconscious with boredom  before the end.	2000-05-05

Alternity gamers who enjoy creating their own ship designs (like  yours truly) will love the expanded options available. In addition, a more  detailed ship-to-ship combat system is also included, though maths-haters  should probably steer wide of it. One exclusion I would have liked was  rules for capital ships, but I guess this will be in a future book. While  the ship diagrams are clean and well done, the other interior artwork is  amatuerish and detracts from the otherwise well written book.

It has long been a gamers' favourite (including this reviewer)  despite the lack of supplementary material. A complete system in one  volume, this book covers all the rules and background required to play:  characters, monsters, combat, magic, religion, and the history and  geography of the Warhammer game world. A short adventure 'The Oldenhaller  Contract' is also provided to introduce new players to the game.<br />WFRP  introduced the unique 'career' system where the players advance through  progression in a series of careers. More than 100 varied careers are  detailed, each with its own skills. This system allows players to create a  truly unique character and offers more flexibility than the typical  Fighter/Mage/Thief/Cleric choices common in other fantasy roleplaying  games. Combat is deadly and realistic (at least as much as is possible in a  fantasy game), which quickly teaches new players to seek less violent  solutions to problems. The standard mechanics are simple percentile based  which is both a plus and a minus. They greatly speed up play (no reams of  tables and modifiers to consult) but have been criticised as being too  simple especially as regards to non-combat skills which do not allow  characters to improve over time. The magic system is the weakest section  in WFRP, being slanted towards the more martial applications - possibly  since it was inherited from the Warhammer Fantasy Battle game.<br />While  the mechanics are not without its faults and the magic system could stand a  complete rewrite, Warhammer fantasy RolePlay (WFRP) succeeds due to its  gothic, dark fantasy background  where cultists and conspiracies lurk in  every shadow. It also has one of the most intriguing game settings ever  published: a renaissance-era 'Germanic' Empire full of roleplaying  potential. Combined with what many players feel to be the finest  roleplaying campaign series 'The Enemy Within' (published separately), this  game is a classic that deserves a place in every rolegamer's collection.players feel to be the finest  roleplaying campaign series 'The Enemy Within' (published separately), this  game is a classic that deserves a place in every rolegamer's collection.	2000-05-02

Especially useful is the in-depth descriptions and  hints on playing Melnibonean characters (which is probably a staple fantasy  of any Moorcock fan). The famous personalities of Melnibone are also  discussed in more detail than the small sample in the main Elric! rulebook.  In the last section of the book are three excellent short adventures to  introduce the players to Melnibone. The first of the three, 'The Suffer  Glass', captures the tone of Moorcock's novels especially well and is  better than most of the gaming books published as individual adventures.<br />The writers have done a fine job of expanding seamlessly on the brief  paragraphs describing Melnibone of Michael Moorcock's Elric books. This  books provide an entertaining read for fans of the Elric series even if you  don't actually rolegame since the book is light on game rules and heavy on  descriptions.

P. Lovecraft. The basic rules have not  changed much through five incarnations, mostly due to its completeness and  elegant simplicity which made it such a joy to play. Call of Cthulhu also  introduced rules for sanity and a whole range of phobias and pyschological  disorders which often produced some of the most memorable experiences in  gaming.<br />This new edition features tight, concise writing, terrific  artwork, and wealth of information and ideas for GMs and players and is a  sterling example of how a game should be put together.

Players have to  contend with a traitor within their ranks, an assault by a commando team,  not to mention a race against time and a Concord fleet massing to blow the  warhulk into tiny particles. I just wonder if this adventure was inspired  by Edward Bryant's short story 'Pilots of the Twilight'...	2000-04-05

The  pages within the book detail the origins, history, motivations, jargon and  unique disciplines of this order of Assassins. Much of the text is very  well done combining real and created history seamlessly. For example, the  author links the Clan's activities to real world Assassin cults like the  infamous Thuggees of India. I also found the sample characters and the  guide to playing Assamites in a campaign very useful for newbie players. My  only complaint is the lack of detail in the descriptions - I found myself  flipping back constantly to the Vampire rulebook to check certain mechanics  which could have been summarized for the book.	2000-04-05

For the knife nuts (like this reviewer) who are tired of scholarly translations of Japanese originals cluttered by footnotes and stuffy academic prose, this book is a breath of fresh air. Best of all, this book also covers in detail several related crafts like sword polishing, habaki-making, and scabbard carving which are rarely mentioned in other books. Generous helpings of photographs and diagrams complete the text. For the blade enthusiast, this is the only book you need to buy on the subject.	2000-04-04

The new stuff is useful to have but the starships are a little bland. While i understand that the  writers wanted to get a good selection of different starship designs, they  should have focused more on the ships likely to interest players like tramp  freighters. I wouldn't call short range one-man fighters 'starships' and a  fuel tanker and a minelayer!  I'm sorry to say that I've seen designs of  better utility free on fan webpages. While the ship diagrams are excellent,  the other interior art is truly disgraceful for a product from a  major  gaming company. The bottom line: this book is nice but you probably won't  miss having it.	2000-01-06

This accesssory is targetted at GMs using TSR's StarDrive  campaign but the Lighthouse can be dropped in to any other with little  work. What we have here is a roving space station run by the Galactic  Concord to travel to distant stars to promote trade and understanding among  the remote citizens of the verge.<br />The basic idea is a good one - as  passengers on the Lighthouse, the constantly changing locales and  situations would give GMs the chance to slip in any sc-fic adventure that  can be dreamed of: action, espionage, intrigue, and diplomacy. The only  thing is that the mediocre art and lifeless writing didn't really inspire  me unlike the top-notch StarDrive Campaign book. I really wanted to like  this book but ended up a little dissapointed.<br />Lastly, I won't even  mention just how much this idea feels like a certain popular sci-fic TV  series of the inhabitants of a distant space station (5th of its type).	1999-05-02

All this is finished off by quality  art as well. This terrific book prompted me to add the Alternity game to my  gaming cabinet.	1999-05-02

The players are on the trail of an ancient Dwarven  artifact of 4 parts with incredible elemental powers. There is some  investigation but this book is are really more appropriate for the  combat-oriented player.	1999-04-04

This is the first new adventure material produced by  Hogshead and while welcome, is not neary as good as some of the older  adventures in the Enemy Within campaign (Death on the Reik, Power Behind  the Throne).<br />In this adventure, the players are racing against time to  forstall an ancient prophecy about the return of a Daemonic entity in and  around the city of Marienburg. The problem is in trying to maintain a  coherent storyline when each chapter is being plotted by different authors.  In the end, the adventure comes across as a mish-mash of interesting ideas  but the coherency is lost. It is still a good book, however, just not  great. There is a good balance of investigation and action and would suit  pretty much any gaming group.	1999-04-04

The quality of GW's early work is evident in this product: an  inspired storyline, terrific artwork and interesting locales.<br />The book  details an epic journey the length of the River Reik challenging the  players with a good balance of invetigation and action as they attempt to  thwart the forces of Chaos.<br />While many people rate the Enemy Within and  Shadows of Bogenhafen higher, this adventure is my personal favourite. Be  warned that the ending seems a bit of an anti-climax. A more epic finale  would have seen this book get a 5-star rating.	1999-04-04
US	52950731	R10LSODLWEAL87	1899749128	121924414	Middenheim : City of Chaos (Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	The best investigative adventure ever published	I am a longtime gamer who probably has spent more on rolegaming then I can afford since the late 1980's. My shelves are filled with books for dozens of game-systems but Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP) remains one of my  personal favourites.<br />This superlative product was originally published  by Games Workshop as two separate books: Power Behind the Throne and  Warhammer City - Middenheim. This Hogshead version has the full material  from both books in one handy volume. The first section of the book, Power  Behind the Throne details an extremely intricate conspiracy by the forces  of Chaos in the city Middenheim.<br />A distinct contrast to the wimpy plots  so prevalent in the fantasy roleplaying industry, this is a grade-A,  master-level investigative scenario for the veteran player. The huge cast  of characters each playing a part in the adventure, yet having motivations  and plans of their own, make this adventure a real challenge for players  and gamemasters.<br />This book should be on every gamer's shelf, regardless  of which game system you play as an example of how it should be done. Be  warned though, the deep roleplaying and many conversations required will  bore the combat-oriented player to tears. Real roleplayers who fancy  themselves as the fantasy equivalent of Poirot or Holmes will have the case  of their lives to unravel.	1999-04-04

The names of the authors would be instantly recognizable for their work and  reputation. However, unlike the Loveless book it was intended to  compliment, this work reads as a dry, mechanical, how-to of building  folders. Sorry, Ron I love your knives and I dream of someday owning one,  but this book won't convert many people into 'knife-nuts'<br />There is a lot  of information here, but this book would probably be of interest to  knifemakers. Also, not covering linerlocks, probably the most popular of  the folder styles is a serious ommission.	1998-10-17

I have read and reread the books and have never tired  of wandering the realm of Krynn.<br />The ho-hum efforts of the legions of  well meaning authors of the spin-off novels were bearable. This effort by  the trilogy's original authors is not. Yes, the Dragonlance series has spun  on too long, but it surely the world of Krynn we know and love did not  deserve to be destroyed so callously.<br />I found myself grimacing at some of  the hackeyed plots involving the gods of Krynn and despairing as one hero  after another is killed off in uninspiring, unheroic fashion. The truly  sickening end to many well-loved characters made my stomach turn.<br />Do  yourself a favour, throw this book into the Abyss. Then re-read the  original Dragonlance Trilogy and revel in the magic and spendour on Krynn  as we know and love.	1998-10-11

Now into its 8th printing, this book is an invaluable guide to anyone who  has ever wanted to know how knives are made. Detailed are the thoughts and  methods of two of knifemaking's greatest craftsmen: Bob Loveless and Bill  Moran.  Great pictures, masterful advice, and clear explainations make this  the best book you can buy about the craft of making knives. More than any  other, this book convinced many of today's successfull makers to turn on a  grinder.	1998-10-11
US	52950731	R1Y2BG14QWQG5Y	0375703241	626650351	Rainbow Six	Books	2	0	0	N	N	This book reads like a comic,  not a gritty Clancy thriller	Before I begin, I would like to state that I am (or was) a Tom Clancy fan.  I loved his early books (Red Storm Rising, Hunt for Red October) and I have  a copy of all of his published non-fiction works (Marine, Airborne,  Armoured Warfare, Airwing, and Submarine). I also happen to be an veteran  Ranger NCO and have a pretty good understanding of the technical details  Clancy writes about.<br />This book comes across like a poorly-scripted  made-for-TV movie (like the abysmal Ops Center). As a Ranger, its nice to  have folks glorifying us as good guys, but does everything have to  black-and-white? The good guys are incredibly good, and the bad guys  incredibly evil (and stupid, i might add). In addition, the unbelievable  plot stretches realism a little thin and does nothing for the book.<br />If  terrorists were really that dumb and make so many critical errors, we  wouldn't need spec ops units to deal with them. We would just spank them  and send them to bed without supper.<br />Counter terrorism is a high-risk  business and casualties are to be expected when engaging heavily armed and  fanatical people, regardless of how well a unit is trained. For a unit to  be so unbelievably lucky (as depicted in the book), all of the time sends  the plot into comic-book territory.	1998-09-16

I have to mention that I am a big fan of Ed Fowler and try not to miss his  articles in Blade magazine. For those not familiar with his style, Fowler  presents a bladesmith's techniques, thoughts, and philosophies in an  entertaining style, free of the technical jargon that clutters similar  books on knives and knifemaking.<br />For the non-knife enthusiast, this book  is still a fine read and you may end up converted (like I was, many years  ago).<br />For the 'knife nuts' this book should be on your table to be read  and reread until you are too old to read anymore. Great stuff, Ed!	1998-09-16
