Great book for adults and children with a vast array of contributions. My husband is an avid sports fan and former lacrosse and football player who just loved the idea of this book. Our pre-teen soccer daughter was able to read and appreciate it. Some of the celebrity types are better known than others, from our President George Bush to Fox News hosts and many in between. The stories are interesting and motivating. I recommend this title as one of the few books that truly can be read by the entire family!	2004-12-04

High quality print and well designed book caputures the voices of many children from across the country on numerous presidential issues.

An interactive journal styled book allows those that purchase an opportunity to express their own views. Kids can write their thoughts on what it might mean to be the president, who they might invite to a presidential dinner or what color they may paint The White House. Kids talk about how they feel about war and poverty and so much more!<br />The Children's Guild is located in Maryland and teaches Transformation and Experiential Education. This book gave contributing writers and artists the experience in expressing themselves through their written words and art. It also gave them the experience of having those words and artistic expressions published.<br />IF I WERE PRESIDENT book is sure to delight their peer group and be equally well received by parents and teachers across the country.	2004-06-14

This book makes a great matching gift to the CD. It is a fun read and nice to see that even though McGraw has reached a high level of success he has not forgotten the band that helped him to get there. There are quotes from his band and some candid shots of McGraw and his band. The new record is excellent and it is hard to believe that McGraw did not write his own songs when he is a master at their delivery and takes complete ownership. By far this is the best musical display of his talent and the book adds just another dimension to that music.	2002-11-30

I found John to be quite candid about his professional tennis career, his personal life from family to first marriage and now with his second wife. I was suprised by the amount of children he has and his hands on role as a parent. He talks openly about success, drugs, fame, family, his past, the present and future hopes and dreams. There are a collection of photographs that add to the story telling and validate this man of many talents. I was a fan during his peak on the tennis courts and found him refreshingly outspoken and spirited. His book is more of the same with a bit of wisdom, grace and class that seems to stem from his age/personal growth. Interesting and enjoyable read.	2002-09-10

Since purchasing WISDOM'S CHOICE, I have had the opportunity to read it and read it again. Each time I was challenged to stop and think not only about Kathryn's words but how they might apply to my own life and spiritual world view. Since I am someone who is quite spiritual I did not have much trouble accepting her thoughts or even the fact that she believes they came to her from a higher power. What I enjoyed most was the breaking down of simple words such as disease (dis ease) and nothing (no thing)and the pages that are filled with food for thought. The book does not preach but rather suggests that you take your own interpretation on what you read. Gently written yet seems to pack a soulful spiritual punch. Size and style make for a nice gift book. If you enjoy thinking about what you have read then this is a must have book. Go a little deeper with WISDOM'S CHOICE!	2002-08-11

Many mothers share their insight and their personal stories on raising teenage daughters. Cheryl Dellasega has created a book that allows mothers across the country to share their own personal challenges on raising teenage daughters.<br />You will read about anorexia, dishonesty, vulnerabilities, crisis intervention, boundaries, love, survival and so much more. Cheryl's book is a gift and like many gift's it was born of pain. She reveals much of herself and her own struggles with her teenage daughter Ellen. Ellen writes a piece in the end as to where they are now. Her portion brought me to tears as her relationship with her mother remains intact.<br />Many other mothers were not so lucky some have lost their daughters to death others to estrangement. The underlying sense from all mothers is of love and wanting to do their best even when faced with situations they find themselves ill prepared. Raising a daughter with difficulties can push an otherwise proud mother into isolation. Isolation from her peer parents. Mothers tend to take their daughters difficulties on as though they  have failed. This book gives you a sense of community, a book that allows mothers to feel less isolated.<br />Congratulations Cheryl, you did it! My own written contribution appears in Chapter 14 titled \\"Ophelia: With and Without Fathers.\\" Well researched and well written for any/every mother of a daughter.<br /><br />Ten years later and the stories are still relevant. The mother-daughter relationship is said to be the most complex and complicated of all relationships and can offer the greatest rewards and the most gut wrenching of challenges.	2001-09-23

Best analogy &quot;Do you hear what I mean?&quot; As a wife of a non verbal communicator and a mother of three one who masters the english language and has strong communication skills to the youngest who struggle with basic communication, I have personally found this title to be instrumental in navigating through our own family and our verbal form of expression.<br />When exposed to those that struggle with the command of the english language I have had to learn new ways to communicate. This tile is completely on target and goes to posture, stance, tone and so much more.<br />How our presentation can make a positive or negative impact on the receiver. Often our intent of caring is misunderstood due to our presentation and/or the preconceived disposition of our intended audience.<br />After reading I was able to grasp the fact that sometimes no matter what was said it was improperly &quot;processed.&quot; Truly it is the processing that counts most. Understanding that not everyone processes the same information in the same fashion can be eye opening and yet become an obvious reality.<br />The author drives home that we need to educate and understand and to be educated and understanding with our communication skills.	2001-08-08

Whether you are negotiating for business or in personal relations, &quot;The Power of Nice&quot; is well worth the read. You will find worksheets to assist you as well as tried and true methods of negotiation.<br />The three P's the author suggests have all the elements of success, they are prepare, probe and propose. Practical thinking and relationship building that works is the thrust of this book.<br />For me, the greatest portion of the book has to do with personal negotiations. Deflecting emotion and problem/conflict solving that works. Probing to find out what the other guy wants and needs so you can propose a win-win solution. Sound advise that works.<br />I am a business women who has attained a certain level of success. But it was the applications to the many teenage conflicts that I had encountered that gave me the greatest respect for the authors. Using their techniques in my business life had been easy. After reading now I was opening my eyes to what these same techniques could do for me in my personal relationships.<br />The chapter titled, &quot;Difficult Negotiators&quot; was filled with insightful and practical people skills. Coming from the Baltimore area, I also enjoyed the Cal Ripken-Peter Angelos points of reference.<br />For young people entering the business world this book should be required reading. For those that still subscribe to the kill or be killed mentality of doing business, I would also recommend this book.	2001-06-15

O'Reilly writes like he speaks with preception, insight and honesty. He says the things we know are true yet would never dream of saying out loud.<br />Gave the book to my husband for Christmas, and we both enjoyed reading it. Topics like family, parenting, children, money and success. Although we agreed with most of his view points, sadly many are unaccepted in todays world. He speaks of helping out our parents as they age, an admiral quality that few families support. Assisted living sites are sprouting all around this country. Also suggests that grown children should not seek revenge against their parents which we also believe to be sound advice. However, we have personally witnessed many young people do just that. Children that have grown up with every possible advantage in education and creature comforts. Children that grew up and were aided by willing attorneys that could not wait to extract a pound of flesh from unsuspecting parents that truly did the best that they could.<br />We agree with O'Reilly but found some of what he had to say a bit outdated. Sound advice that the younger generations does not seem to subscribe.<br />The book is direct and very well written, it is interesting and well thought out. Makes for deeper thinking and great sharing. My husband and I discussed many issues that O'Reilly writes about and for this alone it was well worth the purchase.<br />We need more people like Bill O'Reilly, people who are honest and outspoken yet have no interest in hurting anyone!	2001-01-03

Each photograph tells a story, perhaps unlike the Public Relations story we have been fed.<br />I was impressed with the nonstaged real life messages these pictures unfold. Many photographs you would otherwise never see and therefore may know of a small section of the Clinton years.<br />As much as I enjoyed the gala events and the black tie functions that are part of this collection, I also enjoyed the more relaxed normal everyday shots. So much has been said about the marriage of Hillary and Bill Clinton, negative things, these photographs show many one on one personal moments. It would be hard to view these pictures without coming to the conclusion that these two people are quite fond of one another.<br />Overall this documentaion of photographs shows an all around man both from a Presidential angle and from that of simply a man, a human being.<br />Well done and makes for a nice slice of history and an excellent coffee table book. A great conversational piece!	2000-11-22

Sooner or later death will touch everyone's life. We may not all react the same but most will experience the stages of loss and grief from denial to acceptance. It can be a long often agonizing and lonely road to recovery. Sadly the impact of loss and death can leave many with a loss of their own will to live.<br />This book does an excellent job of addressing a topic that most people choose not to address until they are directly confronted. I am an author of a children's book on death/loss/grief titled &quot;ANGEL STACEY&quot; and I personally know the impact on the loss of a spouse and raising young children who have lost a parent. This book is for the adult who struggles with their own feelings of loss and often has other family members to consider and to console.<br />Grief has a tendency to creep up in the odd hours of the day and the night and can be overwhelming to those experiencing loss. To have a title, a book that you can reach out and grab at any hour offers comfort. I wish this title had been available sooner as it often was a book that comforted and calmed me most during my own deep dark hours of despair.<br />Written from knowledge and from a place of understanding and guidance is sure to make this book a winner and a timeless treasure for anyone who has known a deep loss. It cannot take the pain and hurt away but it will help in the knowlege that those feelings are normal. Also that others have experienced the same and made it back to a seemingly normal existence. Death changes lives and changes people forever, many will grow and change for the better. I was never so humble and in essence never so pure and so good as I was immediately following the loss of my first husband and later the loss of my oldest daughter. It was only later with the anger and ultimately acceptance that I found myself once again on level ground. Death or loss can uproot your entire existence. This book is excellent and necessary.ary.	2000-11-07

The book I purchased had the silver &quot;NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FINALIST&quot; seal and I thought it should be a good read. Even though I am not always sold on titles with so called award status. I started this book and put it down. It did not immediately take me away or even hold my attention. After seeing this on Stephen King's book list from &quot;ON WRITING&quot; I decided to give it another try. I am happy that I did. For whatever reason this time around I picked it up and did not put it down until I finished it.<br />The story is set in a rural town with tweedy characters. Most seem like simple folk with their struggles into inter personal relations. The hero is often the friend and not a family member. A story where community and friends often become the support and the family to those who have become estranged by family for their own frowned upon social misgivings. Love rises to the fore leaving the less desirables behind, those most often being the blood relatives.<br />A nice stringing together of words forming a story that is delicate, often simple and at times redeeming. The ending is one of grace and ultimately good winning over bad.	2000-11-07

Each story begins with a beautiful color drawing which has a classic charm and feel. Clearly hits a personal note for Catholics and Italians and most stories will ring a personal chord of truth and others may bring a laugh or two.<br />As a reader it made me feel for the past and wonder about how our society continues to evolve in a cooler less personal social strata. It is hard not to think of simplier times that are grounded in basic life lessons of love and family. This is a book to read at the beginning of the holiday season and probably at intervals throughout.<br />There is hope, love and warmth in all of the &quot;Seven Stories of Christmas Love.&quot;	2000-10-11

Seldom have writers of King's stature been so forthright and open.<br />His line, &quot;you must do two things read a lot and write a lot&quot; is simple and yet profound. His reading list and examples of good and bad writing offers clear insight and information that is easy to digest. A book to learn from as well as an excellent autobiography.<br />You will also read about the personal trials and tribulations of King and get a fair sense of his values and where his motivation lies. You may also come to the old adage, &quot;behind every great man is a great women&quot; as it is clear that with the love and support of King's wife he has been able to overcome many obstacles. From his drug and alcohol days to his more recent set back associated with a car accident.<br />This book is all that I thought it would be with some nice extra's on the personal revelations of the writer.

Sweet and sincere best describe this lovely collection of love letters  from Ronald Reagan to Nancy Reagan. The media seemed to show that Nancy  Reagan was a control freak and overbearing during The White House years,  this book tells another story. The story is of a man and a woman deeply in  love and totally committed to one another. What impressed me most was the  sweetness and the vulnerability of this once very powerful man.<br />Many of  the letters have been scanned from the original copies so you get a real  taste of the time and the personality of Ronald Reagan.  The letterhead is  often from various places and penned in his own handwriting. These letters  show his most private and personal feelings of loving his wife and just how  much she meant to him. You also get some insight into his sense of humor  and in his ability to love and express love. I was charmed by the feeling  that he never took his position(s) in government life so seriously that he  lost his true core and his true heart.<br />At first I was a bit shocked that  Nancy Reagan would share something so personal because that was not the  impression I once had of her. I also wondered what was in it for her? Fame,  she has, fortune? But I later learned the proceeds from this book will  benefit the Alzeimers Foundation. Whatever her motivation this is a  wonderful surprise of a book and a great way for her to share some really  neat things about one of our ex-presidents.	2000-09-13

This is an excellent beginners book as well as a terrific reference book.  I had also purchased the Idiot guide and thought it was great, this book is  filled with alot more. I am referring to the 2nd Edition.<br />Straight  forward knowledge and definations with a host of pictures to illustrate.

A wonderful collection of some of the most remarkable authors likes and  dislikes and what books influenced them most. From childhood memories to  adult appreciation, each author shares their favorite titles as well as how  they came to appreciate reading and the written word.<br />As a fellow author,  I felt like I had a window seat into the soul of many great writers.  &quot;WAR AND PEACE&quot; won many votes as a favored choice.<br />Some  authors distinguish between historic works and current favorites. Most  agree that readers make writers! Each author seems to highly respect the  written word.<br />Truly enjoyed the stories told about what was viewed as the  catalyst to an early appreciation of books. My only negative comment would  have to be on the size of the text. Personal opinion is that with so much  written word on a page, you can lose the interest of the reader. These  stories should be appreciated and read.<br />Easy to see why this would make  an excellent choice for any adult book/reading group.	2000-08-10

Silverman speaks out on the abuse suffered as a child and as a child that came from a highly regarded family. Her story telling is excellent and even  the abuse is told from the view of pain rather than pity. Not only will you  hear the true story of sexual abuse but the fight for a peaceful life and  inner search that moved Silverman from a victim to victor.<br />Having  volunteered and worked with many young abuse victims from child to  adolescent, her story was sad but also inspiring. Many victims grow to  blame the world for the pain ensued upon them. They allow the abuse to  wreck havoc with all interpersonal relationships. Silverman confronts her  abuse, her abuser and moves on to the path of strength and wellness.<br />She  shows courage and fortitude in her search for inner peace. Having read many  titles on this subject, I have found this to be the most inspiring and  sound. Many others are written from the one-sided victim role and this  title finds the balance and answers the questions; What am I going to do  about it? What can I do to get better? How can I help myself and help  others?<br />Be warned you will read some acts of abuse that will make you  cringe and perhaps put the book down to reflect.<br />An adult title for  anyone who has experienced abuse or is associated with an abuse survivor or  works with abuse survivors.	2000-08-09

Having purchased many books  on this subject, this IS the BEST single source I have found.

As a fellow author of a child's book on death, &quot;ANGELSTACEY/DADDY in HEAVEN&quot;, our family just recently became aware of this title. Our 8 year old twins love the Little Bill books. They are also children who lost their mother in childbirth. At this age they have a better understanding of loss/death. We as their parents encourage any questions about their natural mother.<br />Typically it is our twin daughter who has been the most vocal about death and her natural mother. Having stumbled upon this title with my son, he showed interest in the book. It was a good read for him at a time when he is beginning to question and seek out more answers about death.<br />Little Bill books are so colorful, full of heart and always a life lesson. They are easy to read and geared to the 4 to 8 aged reader. This is a topic close to my heart and our family and this title addresses it well.<br />Take it from someone who knows first hand how difficult it is to address this topic with a young child, this is a solid, healthy approach to a subject that needs to be better addressed and this is yet another excellent way to address it.	2000-08-03

I read this title when it was first published and at that time my  motivation was in trying to understand my own ambivalent feelings about my  mother. Today I finished it in search of trying to understand my twenty  year old daughter. This title has helped me on both ends.<br />First my own  mother was never what I preceived she should be, I had my mental image that  she did not live up to, and as a teenager, like most, I was very critical  of her. This as noted in the title is about healthy separation. Most  daughters when they come to learn they really can fly on their own can and  do return to a grown up healthy mother-daughter relationship.<br />Of course,  my mind was that I would never let my daughter feel the void I felt with my  own mother. I was affectionate, supportive and present for my daughter. My  mother of course was not these things in my view. I believe that I raised  my daughter much differently than I was raised by my own mother. I have no  recall of long conversations, hugs, kisses or tender times with my own  mother. I do however have many memories of these times with my own  daughter. From the book and from my own personal experience I have learned,  it really made little difference. My daughter would do what she wanted, how  she wanted in her own way to self identity. Also from this book often the  separation is harder and harsher for the closer mother-daughter  bond.<br />This title was ahead of its time when I first read it, all the  women's groups were recommending it. All these years later I have to say it  has stood the test of time.<br />Need to understand the mother-daughter bond  better? Then this IS the book to buy!	2000-08-03

Wish I would have had this book before my poetry book,&quot;BARE BREASTED  HEART&quot; was published! There is alot of really great information here  not only on the art of writing poetry but how and where to look for  publication.<br />However, what I enjoyed most was the information on  performing! Many new writers just do not fully understand how important it  is to get out and show/perform your work. I used to say, &quot;I write so I  do not have to speak!&quot; in retrospect I have never had to speak out or  read from my books as I have since they have become published.<br />Further to  sell ones books, author events, book signings and the sharing of one's  written word is vital. Not to long ago I was asked to speak at a &quot;MEET  THE AUTHORS&quot; event. I read several poems from the above mentioned  title, this made the difference from a few sales to a few hundred sales! I  only wish I had the insight and the knowledge this title brings prior to  learning on my own and learning as you go.<br />I strongly recommend this book  for the poet who not only seeks publication but also truly wants to share  their written works with an audience!	2000-08-03

I am a huge Judge Judy Fan, this is excellent title for  adults who may think living together is easier than marriage. Well marriage  has laws and rules, living together has shades of gray.<br />In her usual  honest style Judge Judy gives her opinion and her experience as a family  court judge. She has seen and heard it all and this title is a great  attempt at sharing some possible answers to a variety of relationship  issues. She talks about ownership and the easiest way to handle ones  personal/financial affairs.<br />This is common sense stuff that needs to be  told and shared coming from the mouth of one who knows best. I also loved  her childs title &quot;Win or Lose&quot; and adult title &quot;Beauty  Fades.&quot; She has a style that is direct, honest and full of common  sense.<br />To read her books is to hear her voice!

There seems to be a real emotional and deep love between John  and Caroline. You walk away feeling like these are just real normal people  with the same issues we all face.<br />I believe the author was respecting  what little privacy this family has by not going into more details, however  much of the book is already common knowledge.<br />The book is about the  prince of the most loved american family, his trials and tribulations and  the ultimate ending of his life that arrived shockingly and all to soon.	2000-08-02

I am a Cokie Roberts fan and have heard and watched her with her husband  on book TV. This title intrigued me, as this is a topic close to my heart.  Cokie does address the mother-daughter relationship through an almost  historic view. There are some sharing of personal stories, soundly but yet  lightly addressed.<br />As with another reviewer, I expected more, that is not  to say it was not a good read. In fact it was easy to get through and  enjoyable. Personally I felt Cokie could have done more with this subject.  It seemed to me there was nothing new from the aspect of other works on  mother-daughter relations. Where you might find the difference is in her  own personal female roles and relationships.

This title should be read by parents, granparents and any adult  educator involved with young boys. Using case studies the author shares his  insight and years of experience as to what works and what does not work.  You will also read about what historic tradition values have done to boys  in the past and alternate ways of caring for our sons emotional needs. I  found the writing to be both interesting and informative. A must have title  for parents with a son.	2000-07-24

The main theme is the difficult mother-daughter relationship and its many twists and turns. The Ya-Ya sisters are eternal friends who have connected doing girl to gal to grown up women activites. This group though likeable,  seems to lack in education but make up for it in their southern bonding  rituals. There were some pages of excitement and others that seemed mute.  Although I enjoyed the read, I might have liked it better shortened. This  was the first Rebecca Wells title I read, I did go on to read &quot;Little  Altars&quot; later.	2000-07-24

This title is small but packs alot of support and positive words toward the abuse victim. Chapter topics include HEALING IS POSSIBLE, THE DECISION TO HEAL, UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WASN&quot;T YOUR FAULT, THE CHILD WITHIN and  more. All written with an under tone of support. There are also several  stories of abuse told from the surviving victims view. The title is filled  with insight and support and is best described as an excellent beginning  point for those looking to heal. A very sensitive and difficult subject  that is well addressed.	2000-07-24

Never one to jump on the &quot;current craze&quot; wagon I finally gave in to the Harry Potter craze! I am in awe as to the amount of fun, fantasy and the range of lesson and feeling in this book. This was the first one read  but won't be the last.<br />First it was the shampoo girl at my hairdresser,  she is 19 and telling me how much she enjoyed Harry Potter. Then to see the  craze and that kids are letting go of computer games, gameboy and TV to  read! My 8 year old loves it and he has just started reading it. My son is  a perfect match for Harry Potter as he is extremely dramatic and creative  but also full of feeling.<br />Is is easy to see why the range of readers is  so diverse and why the craze.

This book shows the ordinary life of this talented and driven athlete.  Should inspire and confirm that everyday effort and hard work makes for  success.  You will find Cal's boyhood stories and read about his entire  family's passion for the game. The role model his father afforded him.  There are stories about his wife and children and his genuine competitive  spirit. I was struck by the ordinary upbringing and the seemingly level  headedness that he has maintained throughout his success. I am a fortunate  season ticket holder who attends many games. And I am always amazed at the  class and level of integrity that Cal seems to possess. Even as a local and  available to many reports on Cal at play and with charitable events, this  book still offered an interesting read.

I was shocked as some of what I read and when I spoke with several young  teen girls, they were not shocked at all. Many had friends who were  depressed or had eating, alcohol or drug addictions. Many are coming from  higher educational and higher economic backgrounds. Held my attention and  was extremely informative.

Just the subtitle alone says alot, &quot;The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling&quot;, think about how difficult it is to feed someone who isn't hungry?<br />This title was brutually honest and Gatto had my  instant respect for giving us the inside look. After reading I was left to  wonder why anyone would subscribe to public education?<br />Loved the thoughts  on independent study, community service and mostly solitude. This man is so  on target and yet as a society we continue to go along with the pack?<br />I  just wish I had this information prior to my oldest daughter graduating  high school. Although she did very well, an honor student in a small  preparatory school, it has become increasing clear that she was not only  ready but capable of college classes prior to grade 12. Not just from the  course selection and level of instruction but also from the college campus  experience. The freedom of choice and the responsibility of campus life. We  are so stuck in ONE-WAY to educate that often we overlook the BEST  way.<br />There is nothing in our society that is as conforming or stuck in  deep structure as our government run schools and just as Gatto writes,  &quot;compulsory government monopoly mass-schooling&quot;, think about that  phrase? How many kids today find they do not &quot;fit&quot; into what the  system wants and how they are compared to other students?<br />How many grown  adults look back at their school aged years as the worst years in their  lives? I wish every parent would take the time to read this book because at  the very least seeds would be planted on thought worthy issues.<br />Having  purchased several books on home schooling/alternate education etc, this was  the most thought provoking. It was also the most interesting read!	2000-05-29

This is the most  disturbing title I have ever read. I want to believe that no one could make  up this much of a story but where are his brothers to support him? Why was  he the &quot;chosen&quot; abuse child? How could this have gone on so long?  Why didn't Dad do something? If a child is not fed for three weeks, could  they really survive? All the toxic drinks and he didn't die? I just do not  want to believe that this could have happened and continued for so very  long.<br />  There was so much repetition in the telling of the story I  wanted to say, &quot;OK, you made your point.&quot; It seems like a  childhood purging that is extremely disturbing and never ending. There is  little style in the writing.<br />  Besides the author getting a form of  therapy from writing this book, I just can not imagine to whom I would  recommend this book.	2000-05-29

Having done extensive research into the area of child sexual abuse, and if I had to suggest but one book to read,  this would be the one. A tough subject to write about, this book talks not  only about the abuse but suggested treatment and how to go about picking up  the pieces. Written from factual accountings and proven methods of  treatment, I found this title to be less upsetting to read than many  others. In part because you know the abuse stories but seldom do you read  about how the abuse affects the entire family. Further what works best for  the entire family. Case studies are documented and it is written in clear  and easy to read language. Again the best single source of information on  sexual abuse that I have read.	2000-05-29

So many women today think we have to do it all and do it PERFECTLY! Finally a book of high standards that also states the reality of choices and the responsibilities that come with choice. This title is SO much  better than Maria's earlier work. This is an honest and accurate accounting  of life, and womanhood, motherhood and being a wife and a professional.  Maria Shriver has proven herself a woman of substance but clearly this is  also a coming of age and self acceptance book. Wisdom to be shared with all  women. Some of the ten items listed are a bit obvious but yet need to be  re-visited. Maria's best work yet!	2000-04-27

I loved it and so much of it seemed like she was speaking directly to me. I felt like I heard her voice! I am in agreement on so much, I personally agree that as a society we are medicating more children than necessary. In  part because teachers bring it to the parent, they do not want to deal with  any outbursts so it must be ADD, we have become so intolerant. As she  states, a child must feel, &quot;something must be wrong with me.&quot;  This book is great for women but also for parenting. The grown children  advice is perfect, wish I would have used it before I spoke my mind! I  CANNOT BELIEVE HER HUSBAND ALLOWED HER TO PRINT THE PINK PANTIES STORY!  Overall, I found it to be a good read and easy advice to accept.	2000-03-07

At the age of 23, my husband died, leaving me alone to raise our two year old daughter. About the age of six, I shared this book with her. This title remains in our family library. An unemotional yet touching sharing. Leo  Buscaglia has done so much for our humanity and does it in a real, from the  heart sharing of his own soul. I have sat through his lectures and read  more than one of his books. He has my utmost respect not only having  experienced the loss of my first husband but also as a published author of  &quot;Angel Stacey/Daddy in Heaven&quot;. For many years I have and I will  continue to recommend this title.	1999-07-28

As a mother of a very difficult eighteen year old daughter,  I found this book to be direct, honest and very helpful.  I felt very alone and upon ready I realized that I was not alone at all.

Thank goodness there a books for people like me,  as I am always at a loss for gift giving!

The cover makes you smile  and it is an easy, light and fun read!  Thanks Santa!	1999-01-04
