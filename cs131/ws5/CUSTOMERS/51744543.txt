It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't have a TOC, so people can see all the numerous topics covered (and the topics do seem to be covered in good detail).   I think it covers every of a couple dozen relevant topics.  There are 2 chapters at the end (appendix?) which cover the basics of networking, which is either a plus if you can use this, or just ignore them if you're a \\"heavy\\".

(blame the Publisher)	Since amazon.com keeps reminding me to rate this (because I bot it), here goes, although I haven't finsihed reading the whole book yet.  It does have a lot of extra info (than other cert books), which may be a negative if you just want to pass the exam.  It also omits basic practical things that an experienced SysAdmin would include. e.g. after stop-A, type \\"sync\\" at the ok prompt, to try to do the important sync of the filesystems (also called \\"panic zero\\").  I tried to use the chapter on format/partitioning for a student, but as we tried to read thru about the 3rd paragraph, it was so strangely worded that even I (Sr. SA) couldn't figure out what Paul was alluding to. (I began cursing the book at that point!)  Many of the disk examples were done on Intel/X86 IDE disks (not Sparc SCSI).<br />I place most of the blame on the PUBLISHER: the McGraw-Hill editor or whoever was in charge should be FIRED for total incompentence and lack of any dillience. Yes, I can tell them how to do their job;-) : send review copies to qualified people who will actually read a chapter or two, AND follow up to verify that the reviewer did actually do this.  One last thing: the back cover belongs to a DIFFERENT book (the net admin, future book).	2002-01-27

Very slick, efficient, flexible mechanism! I suspect the version 1.01 fixes the bad-initial-release-CD where the program silently &amp; instantly vanishes after a few commands; or simply download the corrected [almost-whole 7MB] version which is clearly linked on the main Sybex home page.  As to the content and functionality, it's very cool! You can print out the labs one-by-one to write on (instead of the enclosed booklet), but unfortunately you apparently can't print out the on-screen-only picture/diagrams. tab and ? works great, although the command set is very limited, which is why I'm glad I went and bot an old but REAL 2501 also. Feel free to write me at ccie-at-dwp.net  Also, I didn't spend all the money on the 4 corresponding Sybex books (which are actually in pdf on the cd in the back of the books), so that leaves me lost as to the context for the labs.  One last issue is to make sure you will find the motivation to spend the time working with this, after you've spent almost as much money as one real router!	2002-01-09

(I wrote a review, saying this was the &quot;ultimate cheat-sheet&quot;, but  my review got deleted!)  I think this book alone (IF you understand &amp;  remember) might be enough to pass the written! (Of course, the 2day Lab is  infinitely harder.)	2000-07-22

When I'm in the recruiting booth at job fairs &amp; someone comes by, looking for a &gt;60K job after just taking an MCSE course, I hold up this book, and tell them: &quot;Go get  THIS book! Practice every single word of it, on two networked old $50  486-PCs.  THEN, after that hard work, come back and you will earn your  $60-100K! &quot;	2000-07-22

I looked at this in a store, and it seemed superb, for the price.  Covers what a competent/  computer-literate person needs to get a LOT out of Linux.  I esp. liked that it includes RH 6.1 cd. But I haven't seen it for  sale anywhere else, and it looks like it's not immed. avail. here ;-(	2000-04-04

(Looks GREAT!)	Looks good. I've learned from what I read so far! Page 123 top-half  was hard (for me) to grasp. [comments?]  But the example for that  section/topic (classless) was 100% clear! *PLEASE* post reviews if you have  concrete knowledge on whether the MANY GREAT-looking scenarios are relevant  &amp; useful practice for CCIE lab! Thanks!!	1999-09-12
