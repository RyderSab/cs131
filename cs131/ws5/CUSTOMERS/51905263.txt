I travel a lot and for the last few years, I think every third person in the airport was carrying THE DA VINCI CODE. I bought the book after some friends in my Sunday School Class were talking about how good it was. Like most people, I couldn't put it down. I am able to distinguish fact from fiction and since I read a book to be entertained, DaVinci filled the bill. I was entertained during the entire story. It is easy reading, compelling and fast paced. A lot of research went into this novel and it raised some questions that were easy to investigate. I know the Catholic Church re-wrote the Bible centuries ago but reading this book did not shake one iota of the faith I already have. I read it as FICTION with bits and pieces of fact interspersed!  But it certainly was a fun read!<br />Now I am looking forward to the movie.	2004-10-26

His writing is very compelling--one can become involved in the story on the first page.  His books are very thrilling with a lot of twists and turns.  There is always an evil villain that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Oftentimes I'll have trouble sleeping if I read Baldacci before going to bed!  My heart does so race!  My favorite books by this author also have a touch of romance, which fits the bill for my favorite 'happily ever after' books.  THE WINNER has all of the above ingredients, I'm happy to say.  LuAnn Tyler, a twenty-year old down on her luck mother agrees to help throw the lottery (against her better judgment).  The man who makes all of this possible (Mr. Jackson) is an evil genius whose plan slowly unravels ten years later due to a newspaper reporter's inquisitiveness.  Mr. Jackson will eliminate anyone who tries to get to close to him.  Anyway, you get the picture......  <BR>So, if you want to read a wonderful story that will keep you glued to a great book, try THE WINNER--you will be the winner for having read it!	2003-12-01

He created the sculpture, \\"The Little Dancer\\" based on Marie's likeness.  This was the only Degas sculpture to be exhibited during his lifetime. This charming figure was wearing a tutu and a wig.<BR>The illustrations in this children's book are beautiful and even some of Degas' own paintings are included. I wish that more of Degas' life had been included in this story. I also feel that this book would have been perfect if more of his paintings were displayed with descriptions of each work of art.<BR>This book is a good introduction to Degas and should be targeted towards lower elementary students.	2003-11-21

Mr. Bloom is a retired gardener who is the proud owner of a lovely book about the great French artist, Claude Monet.  After hours and hours of studying Monet and his life, the pair begin the ultimate adventure: a trip to Paris, and where it all began!  Linnea and Mr. Bloom visit the Marmottan museum to observe the many paintings of Monet.  They study his artwork and how the genius painted.  They learn about other Impressionist artists--many who were great friends of Monet.  Eventually the young child and elderly gentleman make the ultimate trek to Giverny, where Monet lived and painted.<BR>This book could almost be a 'fun' textbook.  The artwork, both of the author's and of Monet's is absolutely exquisite.  Becoming familiar with Monet's life and his paintings become a marvelous art history lesson.  As an adult, I not enjoyed reading this lovely book but I learned a lot.  In fact, a few days after reading LINNEA in Monet's Garden I was watching a Sex in the City episode where Charlotte was showing a group of people one of Monet's 'lily' murals.   Being familiar with that painting because of this book was an exciting moment for me!	2003-11-14

She is the no-nonsense (almost stereotypical) 'middle aged' English woman who is quite happily, single.  In fact, at 32 years of age, Amelia has no interest in men and enjoys dressing as plainly as possible.  Since the story takes place in the 1880's, Amelia must have a female traveling companion and quite fortuitously rescues the exquisite, sweet, blue-blooded Evelyn Barton-Forbes.  Together the women go on a wonderful journey that leads them down the Nile to the ancient burial chambers of Khuenaten.  It is here where they are reacquainted with the Emerson brothers who are excavating the burial sites.   And thus, the adventure begins.  <br />I loved this little novel.  There is adventure, mystery, a lot of ancient history and even romance.  In fact, I couldn't put this book down!  The title refers to a poem found in an ancient scroll.  Walter Emerson (Evelyn's love interest) translates the hieroglyphics into lovely verses that Amelia explains as, &quot;The crocodile is a symbol of the dangers and difficulties any true lover would risk to win his sweetheart.&quot;   And naturally, the poem is a reflection of what happens in the book.  I can't wait to read the next one!<BR>I also want to echo another reviewer and thank AMAZON for their wonderful lists.  I have discovered the best books because of you!	2003-11-12

I guess it is the wonderful writing that made &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; such a compelling page-turner.  I loved all the descriptions of the British aristocracy (or should I say the 'idle rich'?) during the early 1700's. And I was intrigued and repulsed by the images of the French royalty (and their patrician friends and acquaintances) and the lurid and decadent details of their nightlife.  Learning about the workings of Tamworth, the lovely estate that is central to the story was absolutely fascinating. <br />When I read a book, I like to transport myself into the principal character (or the female who is closest to the lead).  Even with the 'Harry Potter' series, I can visualize myself (quite easily) as a student at Hogwarts.  I could not see myself as Barbara Aderley.  I can't imagine falling madly in love with a man who was almost 30 years older than me WHEN I WAS TEN!  Throughout the entire novel, we are constantly reminded what a good, kind, honorable, and decent man was Roger Montgeoffry.  I'm sorry; I just couldn't see those qualities.  To me, he was a selfish, thoughtless individual who lived a very immoral and depraved life.  And I am not referring to his 'little secret'!  He was a horrible husband who had no qualms about leaving his fifteen year old wife (for more self indulgences) immediately following a horrible tragedy.  Throughout all of this Barbara remained in love with Roger--I can't understand it. Wouldn't these events have been an impetus to sever the relationship (for most normal people)?  I also felt cheated because supposedly Roger had promised an explanation for his actions--and we never received it.  I love fairytales--any book or movie where there is joy and most definitely 'happy ever after.'  There is very little joy in this saga; very few people are kind and there is a lot of death (read with kleenex).  I really wanted something good to happen to Barbara, Therese and to poor Tony (who started off being fat, stupid and insecure and then morphed into movie star good looks, confidence and intelligence) but nothing ever did.<br />I recommend THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY to anyone who enjoys a well-written historical novel.  If you enjoy a warm fuzzy book, then read Rosemund Pilcher (my preference!).	2003-11-04

SCARLET FEATHER, another novel by the renowned Irish author Maeve Binchy, takes place on the Emerald Isle, of course!  Each character in this novel is so believable and has so much personality that the reader is actually transported into each little vignette.   The main characters, Cathy Scarlet and Tom Feather realize their dream of owning their own catering company.  Every person who comes into their lives, whether it's Cathy's husband Neil, or Tom's girlfriend, Marcella, Simon and Maude, (nine year-olds who transform from evil twins into adorable little cherubs) or Muttie and his wife Lizzie all make this the most scrumptious novel.  Even though starting their own business is definitely not smooth sailing and the young couple must prevail over money problems, relationship dramas, vandalism and theft, this book is still a tremendously fun read.	2003-10-23

I receive group messages and frequent her web site.  I even slipped into a mild depression when completing FIERY CROSS knowing it would be a few years before I would be able to find out what happened to my beloved Jamie and Claire.  Her books are among the best I have ever read---until LORD JOHN and the PRIVATE MATTER.  Even after reading the dismal reviews, I was determined to like this book.  I find it difficult to believe that Diana even wrote this book.  I knew this book would be totally unrelated to all things Outlander but I figured that the same great writing with wonderful character development that we are so accustomed to would continue with her new series.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  In fact, I know no more about Lord John after reading a book about him than I did from reading the Outlander books.  Plus, I had a hard time following this mystery.  For example, when Lord John would notice a 'look' in a servants eye, I wasn't certain what that look meant. <br />I don't mean to write a scathing review because this book is not horrible--it's just not great.  Read it for what it is, a little mystery story that is mildly entertaining.	2003-10-21

UNCLE JED'S BARBERSHOP is a book I enjoy reading over and over to kids of all ages.  What a marvelous lesson.  I think it is important for kids to be reminded of how unfair things were to African Americans many years ago.  But the best part of the book reminds us all that if we work hard enough, we can realize our dream.

(2.5 stars)	Since JANE EYRE is one of my favorite books and since this novel got such great reviews, I decided to buy it.  I have to give Jasper Fforde 5 stars for such a brilliant idea; an alternate reality in Great Britain during the early 1980's where people can jump into novels or poems (and, where characters can leave their existence in novels to jump into 'real life').  There are just too many other things going on:  People traveling back and forth in time, the evil Goliath Corporation in charge of the country, wars lasting centuries, and the pet of choice: the extinct Do Do birds!  There was very little character development (and I'm not counting the marvelous Rochester and Jane Eyre--their characters are already developed thanks to Charlotte Bronte) so there was no one I really cared about in this 'weird' novel.  It was hard for me to follow this story, in fact every night I would have to re-read three or four pages just to 'catch-up.'  I really don't want this review to be too scathing because the end of this story was just adorable; very creative--my favorite part of the book.  Thank heaven that JANE EYRE finally had the happy ending that we all love!	2003-10-05

You have the kick a** Fiona who spends the entire novel slapping Montgomery, screaming at him, or trying to run away.  Then you have the handsome Ace who (with a limitless amount of money and resources) somehow falls in love with this witchy Fiona (totally unbelievable).

It's the oldest theme in the world:  Poor, lonely, beautiful English heroine pulls herself up by the boot straps to become one of the richest women in the world.  It took me forever to get involved with this book but eventually I reached the point where I couldn't put it down.  Fiona Finnegan, the lively eighteen-year old tea house worker lives in poverty in Whitechapel during the 1880's; she and her family may not have material things but they are very rich with their love for each other.  Fiona also has a wonderful fiance, Joe Bristow (they are madly in love with each other).  And then, everything is gone.  THE TEA ROSE is the story of Fiona and her rise to become the greatest business woman in New York.

While striking up a conversation with Sandra, she related to me a little about her yearly visit to Cancun; she even had a stack of current pictures (of her wonderful friends that she so poignantly wrote about).  Noticing how intrigued I was, she mentioned that she had a copy of the book she wrote that chronicled her adventures with Yazmin and other amazing Mayan and Mexican people.  These are the marvelous people that the Songdahls 'adopted' and who, more importantly, had adopted them.<BR>Even with all the many activities of a busy vacation, I read this book in two days.  I then gave it to my husband who was also instantly mesmerized.  I am in awe of the great work that Sandra and John Songdahl do throughout the year:  collecting food, clothing and supplies for the poverty stricken Mayan people.  When Jesus said, &quot;When you do this unto the least of these...,&quot;  I honestly feel that the Songdahl's were his example.<BR>Sandra's writing is compelling; very easy to read.  Her writing enables the reader to become instantly involved with the characters in the story.

By the time I finished the first chapter I was disappointed.  This book was not funny.  &quot;Breathing Lessons,&quot; it's not. Gone are Tyler's quirky characters (the characters in this book were all one dimensional, even Delia's children and husband).  I also had a little bit of trouble with the subject matter.  I'm sure all mothers (especially of teenagers) fantasize about leaving home but most do not.  What do we think about fathers who leave home?  They are horrible people. How could a mother leave her children for a year and a half?  I realize that Delia was probably going through a mid life crisis and a form of depression but I kept wanting to say, &quot;Call your children and see if they are okay!&quot;<BR>Anne Tyler is still brilliant when writing about the mundane things of every day life.	2003-08-13

I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT is the story of a British Female Executive with an eighty-hour work week who also happens to be married with two young children.  This book made my life when I had two small kids years ago (while teaching school, Sunday School, having a Girl Scout Troop, and carting kids to ballet, art, piano, gymnastics, soccer, scouts, cheerleading, cooking dinner every night, and a ton of other things) seem like a Rip van Winkle snooze!  Kate Reddy, the thirty-five year old investment broker travels all over the world to oversee her multitude of accounts.  Her long hours away from home eventually take their toll on her family as well as herself.  She works in the stereotypical office (with men who are all chauvinistic pigs); the double standard is alive and well at Edwin Morgan Forster.<BR>This is a great vacation book, easy to pick up but also easy to put down.

LAST MAN STANDING is another wonderful mystery--full of intrigue, action and interesting tidbits about our government that I never knew!  For example, the HRT, which stands for Hostage Rescue Team is a group of highly trained men who are called in during hostage stand-offs.  Web London, a brave and courageous patriot who was an elite member of the HRT is the only man to survive a horrible ambush that kills the entire team.  These men were Web's dearest friends; men he loved as brothers.<br />Despite the fact that London has constantly proven himself to the entire FBI through the years (by constantly ignoring his own safety in order to save hostages or fellow HRT members), this one event immediately turns him into an \\"untouchable.\\"  With the exception of a couple of people, it seems like everyone, from fellow agents to the wives of the fallen men instantly despise poor Web.  I did find this story line a little ludicrous!  Anyway, Web and his friend Romano work to solve a mystery where there are wiretaps, murders, drug deals, kidnapping and impersonations.

THE BUTTERFLY was written in honor of Polacco's great aunt, Marcelle Solliliage and her Aunt, Monique Gaw. Marcelle was part of the French underground and resistance during World War II. She bravely hid Jews in her home during the Nazi occupation. Monique was oblivious to these happenings until she met a young Jewish girl, Sevrine who happened to be hiding in the basement.

We really know nothing more about these children. Oh, and this time there is a murder and an attempted kidnapping.  I know I am missing the boat on this series because kids seem to love these books.  As a school counselor, I tell kids to read anything that interests them, even if it is a comic book.  So, if children love these books, continue reading them!

Recommended by an Amazon friend, I bought this book for my mother who has always lived thousands of miles from me.  As luck would have it, my daughter was visiting me when I started reading this lovely little story.  From the very beginning, I knew this book was written about us.  The tears started flowing on the first page and didn't stop until the last page of this poignantly written \\"Fable For Our Times.\\" WILL YOU STILL BE MY DAUGHTER? is actually a parable about an acorn that falls from a beautiful, strong oak.  The oak loves her daughter and wants to protect her from pain and disappointment.  However, as in real life, we can only hope that our children will have the strength (roots) to persevere.     There is a special bond between a mother and her daughter and this book celebrates that bond.  You must read this beautiful keepsake with your daughter, especially if she is going through a difficult time.  I now need to buy another copy of this book for my mother.  I loved this touching tale and recommend it to all mothers.  Put it somewhere handy so it can be read over and over!	2003-03-25

A lab student from the University read it to her 2nd grade class and Ingrid was immediately besotted.  I am the one who usually recommends books to this first year teacher!  When she began her year of teaching back in August, the first gift I gave her was my beloved THANK YOU, MR. FALKER, my favorite Polacco book.  I wanted her to know how important a teacher is in the life of her students.  I still think of Eleanor Mills, my sixth grade teacher many, many decades ago!<br /> Anyway, MR. LINCOLN'S WAY is one of six Polacco books that I gave to my daughter for her birthday.  It is the touching story of an African American Principal and how he cares so much for his students that he goes out of his way to reach 'the problem child.'  \\"Mean Gene\\" (who is white) is the school bully; he terrorizes the children, especially those who are different because of their race or nationality.  Mr. Lincoln discovers that Gene is passionate about birds and gives him a project--filling the school atrium with birds.  Gene ends up having a complete personality change which is even noticed by his teachers.  The key to this story is Principal Lincoln who takes the time to discover why Gene acts out--a cruel, racist father.  As teachers, we sometimes have students who are 'unlovable' and we never take the time to think why:  Did this child have breakfast?  Is he even loved?  Is he beaten at home?  I think if we spent more time learning about our student's backgrounds, we could touch more lives.	2003-03-23

She has put down snippets of not only her life, but of her ancestors, into delightful stories that transcends all age groups.  THE KEEPING QUILT is about Polacco's Great-Grandmother Anna, who immigrated to New York City.  The only two things that she still owned from her native Russia were her dress and a babushka.  Anna's mother eventually takes parts of her dress and babushka along with old clothes belonging to other relatives and makes a quilt that will remind everyone of their homeland.  This quilt serves as a source of comfort and memories for future generations.  This is another book that I bought my daughter for her birthday.  She will read this book to her second graders perhaps inspiring a new generation to write down the memories of the past.	2003-03-22

This is a fabulous and emotionally touching story of an interracial friendship and the children's journey of love and service.  Young Patricia (who has written another great episode about her rich and colorful life) and her two best friends Stewart and Winston (who happen to be black) want to buy the boy's gramma (Eula Mae) a hat that she has wanted but could not afford to buy.  Since the death of her beloved babushka, Eula Mae also serves as Patricia's surrogate grandmother.  The children witness an act of racism on the hat shop owned by the Holocaust survivor Mr. Kodinski.  They were going to ask Kodinski for a job to raise the money to buy Eula Mae her favorite hat.  Mr. Kodinski sees the children and assumes that they are responsible for the act of violence.  Ultimately, the children redeem themselves by making Pysanky eggs for Mr. Kodinski to sell in his store.  He tells them the story of his life and then gives the trio the hat. Naturally Eula Mae is thrilled.    CHICKEN SUNDAY is named after the chicken dinner that Eula Mae feed the children every Sunday after Church.  This is another multi-cultural book teaching children that it is okay to have friendships with people who are different.  Incidentally, Patricia remains close to these boys to this very day.  It also exposes children to different types of racism.  This book has a wonderful lesson for children and adults.	2003-03-22

Their hearts will be overflowing.  Full of lightning, put there by folks who loved them even before they were born.  Gramma knew this well.<BR>She also knew that someday they would tell their children about all of us, and of the magic nights when we caught lightning in a jar.\\"<BR>Inspired by another of Polacco's real life memories, she writes about a family reunion, after a forty-one-year gap.  Her grandmother organizes all the children, teaching them how to catch fireflies.  The children put these fireflies in a jar and then there is magic!  Childhood memories are the ones that sustain us through our adult life.  And often, we will pass these memories on to our own children and grandchildren.  This is a precious book that will leave all readers with a warm fuzzy feeling.	2003-03-22

First of all, I want to state that I am very passionate when it comes to 'good' children's books.  The HARRY POTTER books are some of my favorite books of all time (my top twenty list).  The Newbery Awards were all given to deserving books that I have adored.  For a while everywhere I went, the Lemony Snickett books were being lauded as fabulous children's literature.  After seeing a segment on CBS Sunday Morning, I went out and bought the whole 'shebang'  (is that even a word?) at my school's book fair (I'm the counselor)!  I was terribly disappointed with the first book.  Yes, it is easy reading, and yes, it does introduce new words (even though my parents always said, \\"Go look it up, you'll remember it!\\").  But the content of the story is so depressing and so unhappy that I was miserable the entire time I was reading!  Character development was so poor that I wasn't even sad when horrible things happened to these children.  Normally I cry when a baby is kidnapped, bound with duct tape (even over her mouth) and put in a birdcage to hang from the top of a tower!  Well, I didn't bat an eye (and I become a sprinkler when reading a Patricia Polacco book).  <BR>There are eight books left in my crowded library to read; I'll keep you posted if they get any better!	2003-03-18

Thankfully, John Grisham has written another page turner in the great tradition of THE FIRM.  This novel has so many twists and turns that you may want to buckle your seat belt for a thrilling ride!  I couldn't wait to finish reading this book--it was hard to put it down.  The entire time I was reading I was thinking, &quot;there is no way Patrick is going to get out of this one!&quot;  As in Grisham's previous 'lawyer' novels, I was fairly confident that the protagonist would not only survive his predicament (and come out on top), but that the villains would 'get theirs' in the end.  I really couldn't see how our dear Patrick (I ended up really liking him and respecting his intelligence) would prevail.  He had too many variables against him.  Plus, he confessed to most of his crimes.  I should have just trusted Grisham to give me the ending I wanted and he sort of did.  I don't want to give away anything but I was a little disappointed in the last few pages of this story.  Everything else though, was typical Grisham.  I recommend THE PARTNER to everyone who loves to read.	2003-03-17

Davis' first book, &quot;Her Kind Of Want&quot; definitely deserved the Iowa Short Fiction Award; her writing is absolutely stunning.  Although the stories in this book are not my usual 'reading fare,' (I prefer Austen, Gabaldon, Pilcher--something uplifting with happily ever after endings) I do make exceptions if the writing is extraordinary.  I loved Kingsolver's &quot;Poisonwood Bible&quot; because of the beautiful writing (even though the story was quite sad).  Both women have similar writing styles.  <BR>I read somewhere that a writer should write what she knows and Davis has written stories about women (albeit damaged) from her native Alabama.  All the women are products of their dysfunctional families with the exception of Dena (who is a product of events surrounding her life).  <BR>Davis' writing is deep, rich, and poetic.  Only a gifted author could have written the subtle differences in each woman's personality.  I was enthralled with every story and the lovely and poignant way each was presented.  The characters are so well developed that by the end of the book, I felt that I knew them personally.  I could not put this book down!  Jennifer Davis is a remarkable writer and I know we will see great things from her in the future (a Pulitzer?).  I also hope her next book will be more uplifting.  I love Southern Writers and am so glad I can add Jennifer to the top of my list!	2003-03-17

What a compelling idea--a story similar to 1984, only with a darling twelve year old boy (Jonas) who is selected to receive all the memories of his community. What on earth does this mean?  Evidently this story takes place in the future where everything is the same.  People are all drugged so that they have no emotions.  They no longer see a world in color; people who are old or sick are terminated.  Only one baby is allowed to survive from a multiple birth. Only certain women are allowed to give birth; the baby is given to a selected man and woman to raise.  When the child reaches maturity, the 'parents' are sent to live with other childless couples.  There is no love, no pain, not even grandparents.  The elders make all decisions.  People don't even select their careers. <BR>At the age of twelve, Jonah is chosen to receive all the memories of preceding centuries from the grandfatherly 'giver of memories.'   <br />Anyone reading this book will know immediately why Lois Lowery received the Newbery award, which is given to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children. The first review I ever read for this book was in the newspaper.  The article stated that THE GIVER would become a classic and suggested that readers immediately buy first editions (for an investment).  After reading my copy, I bought books for both of my teenagers for Christmas.  I loved the book and I really loved the fairytale ending.  But then, not too long ago, I started reading some of the reviews on Amazon.  People were complaining about the sad ending!  What did I miss?  When I read an outstanding book, I have a tendency to read way too fast.  I can't help it; the better the book, the faster I read.  I just can't wait to see what happens next!  Consequently, I miss a lot. But, if the book is really outstanding, I'll eventually re-read it, savoring every word.  Subsequently, I slowly read THE GIVER again, and now, I'm really not certain about the ending.  Did Jonas live happily ever after or was he 'released?'  Readers will have to make their own decisions.  As for me, I'm going to retain my original, warm fuzzy, happy conclusion and forget I ever read a review!	2003-03-04

Thank Heaven for Claire who is always there to heal her husband and son-in -law (not to mention most of the people in the area).  <BR>The Second reason I cried was as usual, the beautiful, romantic things that Jamie says to his beloved Claire:  \\"And that,\\" he said, squeezing my fingers tighter, \\"is what I dinna ken now.  I love you, a nighean donn. I have loved ye from the moment I saw ye, I will love ye 'til time itself is done, and so long as you are by my side, I am well pleased wi' the world.\\" An then, the final words in the book, \\"When the day shall come, that we do part,\\" he said softly, and turned to look at me, \\"if my last words are not 'I love you'--ye'll ken it was because I didna have time.''	2003-03-01

I really felt like I was sitting across the table having a warm and friendly conversation with an old friend, Diana Gabaldon!  Because her 1000+ page books in the OUTLANDER series were written over the course of several years, people tend to forget some of the lesser characters or events.  THE OUTLANDISH COMPANION makes it easy to look up a person or even a Gaelic phrase to become familiar with past events.  Having recently discovered this series, I've been fortunate to read these books straight through (at great expense to my personal life and sleep, I might add).  Frankly, I can't imagine the torture of having to wait years for each book, especially between DRAGONFLY and VOYAGER!    Subsequently, I read this book in chronological order (5th) because I absolutely didn't want to miss a thing (even though the plot and characters remained familiar to me).  I did turn to it twice before to look up a forgotten name and wish I hadn't because I learned something about an individual that took place in a future book.  I do know people who like to read ahead but I won't even read a review of a book until I have finished it; I like to be surprised!    The great part of this book is all the information gleaned from Gabaldon's personal life.  We are introduced to her husband and three children.  We learn that besides the fact that she is a genius (she didn't state this--it's just a given considering the epic tales she weaves) and best selling author (not to mention going without sleep), she has quite a normal life as a wife and mother.  Diana tells us the unorthodox way she spins her tales--not in sequential order, but in bits and pieces.  The result is not only a tremendous insight into the author, but background information of characters (even horoscopes and genealogy-which did not interest me) and events in her delightful novels.	2003-01-12

Wouldn't Jocasta have kept her hidden?  And why didn't she tell people that she was 'handfasted' when her pregnancy was discovered?  It's also ironic that Claire is always saying that Brianna is stubborn just like Jamie. Claire is pretty stubborn herself!  I did enjoy Roger and Brianna's story though.<BR>I disagree with previous reviewers about DRUMS OF AUTUMN needing a villain.  Bonnet is extremely dastardly, isn't he?  Frankly I'm glad Black Jack is gone!<BR>I loved this novel as much as the first three.  The writing is exceptionally beautiful and as we have grown accustomed, the plot is compelling.  As usual, something is happening on every page and I enjoyed the fact that Jamie and Claire have settled down (sort of!).   The last few pages of this 'bonnie tale' are so poignant and touching that I was moved to many tears!<BR>I have learned so much about Scottish and Colonial history; this is a historical novel with large doses of romance, adventure, and fantasy to boot.  And best of all is the love story of Jamie and Claire:  &quot;Your face is my heart, Sassenach,&quot; he said softly, &quot;and love of you is my soul.&quot;  Or, &quot;And when my body shall cease, my soul will still be yours Claire--I swear by my hope of heaven, I will not be parted from you.&quot;  And, &quot;You are my courage, as I am your conscience,&quot; he whispered.  &quot;You are my heart--and I your compassion.

K. Rowling's Harry Potter series is becoming more and more difficult (because everything has already been said thousands of times)!  Trying to give a unique review is also becoming harder and harder.  This is another absolutely stupendous book and I really loved reading it.<br /> Harry has returned to Hogwarts for his fourth year after a fun visit with the Weasleys and a terrifying experience at the World Cup (marking the return of the death eaters).  Quidditch is not being played this year--in its place is a rigorous competition known as Tri-Wizard Tournament.  Only one contestant is selected from each of three wizarding schools with the stipulation being that the student must be seventeen.  Unsurprisingly, fourteen year-old Harry's name is also pulled out of the \\"Goblet of Fire.\\"  Thus begins his solitary voyage.  With a few exceptions, Harry must make this journey alone through much of this novel.  He even becomes estranged from his best friend, Ron (Hermione does remain close to Harry).  The other students make fun of him and even ignore him. The cruelty of the Slytherins is the nastiest.  Many of the things that Harry goes through are the same as what most teens must endure as part of the growing up process.  Unfortunately, Harry does not have the benefit of loving parents to give him some must needed support so he turns to his godfather, his friends, and even a few professors.  This book is much darker and sadder than the first three books but as in the others, the writing is so beautiful that you will feel Harry's pain.  As always, Harry triumphs in the end but even this conclusion is bittersweet.	2002-12-29

For most of my life I have been madly in love with Mr. Darcy from Pride and Prejudice.  Now another man has entered my life:  Jamie Fraser!  From someone who has read thousands of books, I can honestly say that the OUTLANDER series is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure to read.  VOYAGER is the third installment of a fabulous time travel, adventure, historical and romance series.  Claire is now in her late forties (but still looks great!) and returns through the stones back to the eighteenth century and to the love of her life; the tall, handsome, intelligent, romantic red-headed Scottish Highlander, Jamie Fraser (who also still looks great).  I am so much happier now that the couple is back together--I just wish things would slow down a few days and they could have a nice reunion (after twenty years).  But no, as in Gabaldon's other books, there is never any rest for the weary!  Something exciting (or terrifying) happens on every page!      There are a few inconsistencies in this novel.  \\"Red Fish Blue\\" fish was written well after Claire read it to Brianna.  Also, after everything Claire did--giving up not only her life, but her daughter--why did she so quickly leave before finding out the truth about Jamie's marriage?  She refused to even hear an explanation.  But there are only a few contradictory scenes; everything else in this book is delicious!    And of course, Jamie is still (thank heavens) romantic: \\"Christ, I do want ye!  I want ye so badly that sometimes I think my heart will burst wi' the joy of having ye.\\"  Or, \\"Then kiss me, Claire,\\" he whispered.  \\"And know that you are more to me than life, and I have no regret.\\"	2002-12-10

Since my husband drove, this gave me a glorious block of UNINTERUPPTED time to finish DRAGONFLY IN AMBER.  I also brought almost a month's worth of unread newspapers and several unopened PEOPLE magazines.  In addition, I brought along a newly published and highly acclaimed book of short stories written by one of my former students.  My intentions were to finish my book and then catch up on the aforementioned readings.  HA!  Thankfully, I also packed Gabaldon's third book because no amount of self-control would allow me to read anything but VOYAGER!  I have no idea when I'm going to clean my house or do my Christmas shopping (I do still go to work).  The only reason I'm writing this review is that I don't want all the books to 'run together'.<BR>DRAGONFLY IN AMBER is the second book of the highly acclaimed Outlander series.  Jamie and Claire's adventures continue but the story actually begins at the end.  It is 1968 and Claire has returned to Scotland with her 20-year-old daughter, Brianna.  The next nearly 1000 pages involve Claire, Brianna, and a young historian named Roger and their attempts to find out what happened to Jamie, the love of Claire's life (and Brianna's father).  Most of this novel is about what happens to the young lovers in the two years before Claire escapes back through the rocks in the year 1746.<BR>Gabaldon is an extremely gifted writer.  Her character development is so phenomenal that I too, have fallen in love with the red-headed Scottish Highlander. When he says things like:  \\"Oh, Claire, ye do break my heart wi' loving you.\\"  or,  \\"Dye think I don't know?  It's me that has the easy part now.  For if ye feel for me as I do for you--then I am asking you to tear out your heart and live without it.\\"  and, \\" I will find you, (he whispered in my ear).  I promise.  If I must endure two hundred years of purgatory, two hundred years without you--then that is my punishment, which I have earned for my crimes.  For I have lied, and killed, and stolen; betrayed and broken trust.  But there is the one thing that shall lie in the balance.  When I shall stand before God, I shall have one thing to say, to weigh against the rest.  Lord, ye gave me a rare woman, and God!  I loved her well,\\"--it makes me wish I was Claire! <BR>Well, there I go, I'm crying again!  Let me go get my Kleenex and continue with VOYAGER.  Thank Heaven for carryout!	2002-11-23

He blows up Marge and runs away in fear of retribution from both the Dursleys and Hogwarts.  Thus, the adventures begin!  I really don't like to tell too much about the book in my reviews because I believe it spoils the plot for the reader.  Just trust me when I say that this book is another fabulous classic.  I am very stingy when it comes to giving a book 5 stars.  I do this only if I want to read the book again and again.

Because someone recommended OUTLANDER on Amazon, I decided to order the book (the other books this person had recommended were some of my favorites so I figured we had the same tastes).  I had no idea what this novel was about.  During the beginning of the book I thought, \\"Hmmm, this is going to be a science fiction book.  And then, as I read about the handsome highlander and the strong-willed Englishwoman, I thought well, maybe this is a romance.   Next I decided that since every page exploded with activity, OUTLANDER must be an adventure book!  What about all 18th century Scottish history?  Is it a historical novel?  I still don't know how to classify this 850 page saga--I do know that I just finished one of the finest books I have read in a long time!!!  Oh, and please use all the above adjectives to describe this book.<BR>My first suggestion upon reading this book is go to the Internet and read some of the succinct selections on \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie.\\"  I wish I had done it before the reading of this novel rather than after!  Once I started reading I didn't want to put OUTLANDER down to do any exploration.  If you are like me, you will spend every spare second you have reading this book.  I think Diana Gabaldon is a genius to write such a compelling and well-researched story.  Her character development is absolutely phenomenal.  I became so immersed in this stunning love story that I really became depressed towards the end of the book--thinking that Jamie was going to die and Claire would return to the 20th century (didn't Gabaldon foreshadow this?).  Thankfully, the ending was wonderful.  <BR>My favorite line in the entire novel is found on page 331,  \\"Does it ever stop Claire, the wanting?\\"  Wouldn't it be wonderful to be loved that much (especially by someone as pure, good and handsome as Jamie Fraser!)?	2002-10-09

I enjoyed reading this delightful little story on my vacation!  While I didn't &quot;laugh until I cried,&quot; I was very amused at the antics of these two southern sisters.  Since I live in Alabama, I especially enjoyed all the references to the Birmingham landmarks.  This novel started out rather slow but I admit to reaching a point where I didn't want to put it down; I couldn't wait to see who was murdering these people.  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series!	2002-09-24

I now want to explain myself: Jane Austen is the world's greatest author and everything she writes is wonderful.  I just think her other books deserve 10 or more stars.  NORTHANGER ABBEY compared to most books is just fabulous.  I read this book every few years and am amazed at how much more I dislike General Tilney.  Maybe I am imagining how angry I would be if he did to my daughter what he does to Catherine.  But I did enjoy reading about the terrible Thorpe siblings.  They are deliciously atrocious!  Catherine Moreland, the heroine of this delightful novel is a seventeen year old who has the marvelous good luck of accompanying a wealthy couple to Bath.  The people she meets in Bath all shape the next year of her life.  And, as in all of Austen's books, there are villains; but, as usual, the girl always gets her guy (or visa-versa) in the end!  This is why I love Austen!	2002-09-16

As a middle-aged mother, school counselor, and Jane Austen fanatic, I never thought I would be obsessed with a series of books written for children.  Granted, I love children's literature and use books extensively in my counseling programs but Harry Potter has grabbed my heart and is constantly tugging it!  Books become classics when they not only stand the tests of time, but when they can appeal to all ages.  These Harry Potter Books become classics the day they become published!  THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is another powerfully written, dear and sweet novel about the adventures of Harry Potter and his two best friends.  This book is about how good wins over evil but the exploits that the children get involved in are so delicious, so compelling, that only the hardest hearts would be able to put down these books.	2002-09-14

Just read the last few pages if you want to see what will happen!  I can't believe how boring this book was.  It was torture to read.  I really loved the first few books in the series.  The idea was compelling and the writing was pretty good.  Now, I believe the authors think they have become such a commercial success that they feel obliged to turn out a book every few months.  The books are very short; huge margins are found on every page yet it is beginning to take forever to get through each one. And, like I previously stated, NOT ONE THING HAPPENS!  I know one thing, I won't be buying any more of these books; I have wasted my time.  Now, on to Jane Austen where everything is wonderfully written and you can't wait to see what happens next (even if you've read it ten times before!).	2002-09-08

I normally don't like Oprah's books because they are all so depressing but the reviews were so good for this one that I decided to buy it.  And, when I buy a book, I'll force myself to read it (hate to waste that money).  Well, this one was very depressing (to begin with).  Poor Dolores!  She had more problems than the law allows!  But I forced myself to continue with her saga until I had finished the first third--I then couldn't put it down.  The book was more compelling because Dolores and I are the same age; therefore the references to things that were going on in the sixties had a personal relevance.      It is hard to believe that a man wrote this book; Wally Lamb conveys exactly the thoughts and emotions of a female.    When Dolores's mother tells her during graduation that \\"You make me so .......tired,\\" I wondered how many mothers have felt the same way at one time or another.  What a gripping statement.  Throughout the book I was hoping that Dolores would pull it all together and turn her life around.  I was so relieved that she did.	2002-07-23

I can't believe I had never heard of this book until an Amazon.com friend recommended it--and I work in a school! What an enjoyable few evenings I spent reading this adorable story.  The \\"Diaries\\" chronicles two years of Master Adrian Mole's young life (from 13 3/4 to 16).  We are also given a charming insight into the life of the lower class in Britain in the early 1980's.  Adrian is totally clueless about what is going on around him.  He even feels superior to everyone around him because he is such an \\"intellectual!\\"  I imagine that he was probably the class nerd--he just didn't know it.  Adrian's family is totally dysfunctional but his discussions of the outrageous actions of his parents are amusing.  There are many tender moments during the Diaries but overall, the book is \\"dead hilarious\\" and I can't wait to read more!	2002-07-22
US	51905263	R92PKVGTPSHG1	0399231668	931517070	Thank You, Mr. Falker	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Should be required reading for ALL education majors!	As an elementary counselor I read this book to all my students.  There is pertinence for every age group.  \\"Thank You, Mr. Falker\\" is the story of a little girl who can't read.  The other children constantly tease and make fun of Tricia.  Eventually Mr. Falker, Tricia's 5th grade teacher discovers the child hiding during recess (to escape the constant taunts).  He realizes that Tricia has a learning disability and tutors her after school.  There is a post script to the story ending decades later with a chance meeting between Mr. Falker and the adult Tricia (Polacco).  I use this book to help my students with self-esteem problems because of their own learning difficulties.  But, I predominately read this book for all the bullies!  Following Tricia's despair is very humbling.  And trust me, I am not the only one in the room with tears running down my cheeks (and I've read this book dozen's of times).  Teachers and student teachers should read this book--what we do in the classroom has an everlasting and lifelong effect on our students.  I love this book and you will too.	2002-07-17

I would read 5 pages and fall asleep because this book was sooooo slow.  I would then pick up another book to read or my People magazine--anything to not read \\"Shelters\\".  Even when I went on my vacation--I brought 2 smaller books as I knew I didn't want to carry a 10 lb. book on the plane.  Plus, I would not have been able to concentrate.  Since \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is one of my favorite books and because I simply adore the entire series, I made a commitment to finish \\"Shelters of Stone\\".  It did get better, hence the 3 stars.  When I read the other books in the series I was always hoping that Ayla would end her journeys and live happily ever after.  Essentially, this is what has happened and probably the reason why the book was so boring.  Having said that, I am glad I read \\"Shelters of Stone\\" and will definitely read the next book.	2002-07-13

This book was recommended by one of my Amazon Friends and I am so glad I read it.  Since I am so stingy with 5 star ratings, I wish I could give this one 4.5 stars as I couldn't put it down.  As The Crow Flies could also be called, \\"The Life and Times of Charlie Trumper.\\"  It is the epic story that spans the entire life of a British entrepreneur and all the people (good and bad) who affect his life.  It is the consummate rags to riches story.  I read this novel while on a cruise ship-a perfect \\"vacation book!\\"	2002-07-05

I don't think anyone pretended that The Nanny Diaries was the great American novel!  I read this darling book on the outside deck of a cruise ship.  This is the perfect book to read when there are a lot of distractions (like beautiful views).  It was easy to get into and there are not a lot of characters to keep up with.  The writing is crisp and fast paced.  Since my life is so far removed from the X's, I enjoyed reading about the rich and famous (are there really people like that?).	2002-07-02

I know I now need to get ready for all of the unhelpful reviews but at least I'm honest!  The entire time I was reading this book I was asking myself why was I reading something so stupid!  These ladies took \\"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE\\" and changed it around to something so lame that I can't believe it was even published.  I enjoy reading M. H. Clark because she has some nice, mild thrillers with great stories.  This book was not a thriller, nor was it a great story!  A lawyer is sent back to earth (to get his wings--hmmmmmmmmmm where have we heard that before?) to help a slightly sad little girl who has a great life.  There, I've told you the story and you don't have to read it!	2002-06-13

I really liked Anita Shreve's &quot;The Pilot's Wife&quot; so thought that &quot;The Weight of Water&quot; would be another interesting read.  Was I wrong!  The book is boring and depressing--both the present story and the one that took place in 1885.  Whenever I read a book, I like to be moved; either to tears or laughter. But, there is no laughter in this book--not even a smile.  When I finished this book I needed something light and happy; you will too!	2002-06-01

I had heard all the \\"Potter\\" hype but bought the book on a lark to read on the plane (some friends who were teachers recommended it to me). By the end of the first chapter I was totally smitten; in fact, I couldn't put it down! This book reminded me of a combination of the old fairy tales I grew up with. Perhaps a combination of the brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen. There are the sweet heros & heroines, the protaganists, the adventures, and the wonderfully happy ending! Character development is fabulous and Rawling's descriptions are perfect. I have also read this book to a couple of my 4th grade classes and my students were also mesmerized with the story. I would have loved to have gone to Hogwarts myself!	2002-05-12

The main characters in her stories are all so good and sweet (I know, this one did have a villain) AND her books always have happy endings.  Sometimes, when I want to escape into a good book, I want a fairy tale and DAY OF THE STORM is definitely a fairy tale.  This book is such easy reading--I read it on the airplane--very easy to get into.  Pilcher is the best when it comes to character development and while reading this story, you will come to love Grenville, Joss, and especially Rebecca.	2002-05-06

Someone decides to take a cruise over the Christmas holidays and not decorate; hmmmmmmm.  This is a reason for the Spanish Inquisition.  The entire neighborhood is up in arms; yep, it happens every Christmas, doesn't it?  I really like Grisham's other books but this one is just plain stupid!	2002-05-04

I really thought it would be a good Bible story but incredibly, it was a very poor one. It was good to learn that Jacob was a tender lover but a \\"sorry\\" father and leader.  Oh, and Joseph had sex with men and was hated by all who worked with him.  This was a book of fiction!  There was no character development so when people died, I wasn't even sad. Remember, don't read this book if you want to read about God's chosen people; you'll end up wondering why they were chosen!	2002-05-04

After seeing a review for this book in PEOPLE magazine, I decided that it sounded like my kind of story. The reason I gave it 4 stars is I had to read about a quarter of the book before I became obsessed with it! (5 stars is when it grabs me during the first chapter). By the time I had read half of the book I was thinking about it all day at work--looking forward to going to bed early to see what was going to happen. Here is a warning though: Don't stay up too late to finish EVA MOVES THE FURNITURE because you will be so stopped up from crying that it will be impossible to sleep. I ended up loving this story.	2002-02-01
