Nothing has changed--this is still the most important GMAT book to buy, and nothing else on the market comes close to the quality of the questions found in this book (practice books such as Kaplan and Princeton Review fall short here). All of my students who have scored over 700 have used this book as their bible.	2004-01-19

It's a great choice to help you guys reach your full potential on the SAT, but you should be aware that there's a newer edition available, so check that out first.<br />I'm a professional SAT-prep instructor, and I like this book because it teaches all the little tricks that you need to know to raise your score, AND it gives you all the background stuff you'll need to know to do well on your test, e.g., a comprehensive math review, thousands of words that are likely to appear on the test, etc.<br />Without a doubt the best SAT-prep book on the market.	2002-05-28

This book has a lot of grammar explanations and lots of practice questions. So, it is a great value--the price is low, and you get a lot of questions.<br />However, the book is not perfect. The book hasn't been updated in many years, and some question types are outdated. Furthermore, many of the questions are easier than the real TOEFL, especially the reading sections. Also, the CD's that come with this edition are NOT software, they are for listening. And this listening is not of very high quality, it's very amateurish.<br />In short, if you can only buy one book, this one is okay, but the Longman book is much, much better, AND it includes the hands-down BEST practice TOEFL software on the market.	2002-05-28

Second, you need to know that this list is updated every year, with some topics removed and new ones added. The next update will occur around Aug of 2002.<br />After this book was published, TOEFL updated its topics so that there were 185 topics, not ~150 when this book was published. Many of the old topics were retired, and many new ones took their place, so many of the essays in this book will NEVER appear on the TOEFL again.<br />If you don't mind that, this book will give you excellent advice on how to write your TOEFL essay and will show you how to get a 5.0 or a 6.0, which will help you to raise your score. Remember, the TOEFL essay is worth the same as the grammar section (each is worth 1/6 of your total score).	2002-05-28

I'm writing now to complement my previous review.<br />This edition is essentially a re-packaged version of the previous edition, even if the cover and the graphics look different.<br />This set is one of the most important sets of practice tests available on the market and is the second most important TOEFL volume to buy after the PowerPrep!! In other words, buy the PowerPrep first, then buy this edition for more practice.<br />A couple of important points: First, the TOEFL is supposed to undergo major changes in 2004, so if you're not planning to take the test before then, you might not want to get this book. Second, this book contains very few explanations; one of the practice sections of this book has explanations, but TOEFL has used this same &quot;explained test&quot; in all of their publications since 1995. Finally, this publication does NOT contain any computer practice tests--you'll need the PowerPrep for that. The CD-ROM that comes with this set is only a tutorial--the practice is only a few minutes long for each section, and you will NOT get a score.	2002-05-28

This book will give you a good idea of what to expect on the test. First, if you are unfamiliar with the test, the GMAT consists of three sections: one verbal section, one math section, and the essays. In the verbal section, you'll have 41 questions consisting of approximately equal parts of reading, grammar, and something GMAT calls `critical reasoning.' You will see three or four reading passages (like those on most standardized tests), some grammar questions (which require you to figure out what is the best way to put a sentence in English), and some critical reasoning questions, which are basically logic questions.<BR> <BR>On the math section, you'll see 37 questions. You only need to know algebra and geometry to answer these questions, but some of them are pretty tricky. There is no trigonometry or calculus on the GMAT. Some of the questions that you will have to answer are `data sufficiency' questions. These questions present you with some information, and you have to decide whether a math problem can be solved with this information. <br />Finally, the GMAT requires you to write two essays; one of them is a standard essay, and the other one requires you to analyze the reasoning of an argument (most schools pay more attention to your verbal and math scores than they do to your essay scores, though). All in all, the test will take you at least three and a half hours to finish, pretty long for most of us!! <br />Now, about this book. BEFORE you buy a test prep book, BEFORE you take a test prep class, BEFORE you buy other books, you need this book. This is simply the best book on the market, and the only one that contains official questions. (An important note: If you want to save some money, and don't mind the inconvenience of reading the questions in the software, you can actually download the official GMAT software for free from the official web site; all the questions that appear in this book also appear in the free software. The main difference is that you don't have the same easy access to the questions that you have when you buy the book). <br />I have been using this book, and its predecessor the 9th edition, for several years and can offer these comments: <BR>FIRST and MOST IMPORTANT: The questions in this book are generally EASIER than the questions you'll see on the real test, especially the math questions. In the last year or so, GMAT has started including more probability and permutations questions on the real GMAT, especially for people who are scoring pretty high in math, and you won't find too many of these types of questions in this book. If you are really good at math, the questions in this book will most likely seem too easy for you. For harder math questions, I highly recommend the Kaplan book with the CD-ROM (make sure you get the book with the CD-ROM--the hard questions are contained on the CD-ROM, not in the book). <br />One of the best things about this book is simply that it doesn't contain typos, or at least very few (I haven't found any yet, but there might be one or two; there was at least one obvious one in the previous edition). This may seem a minor point, but imagine that you are studying hard, you are confused, and you go to check your answer, and the answer is listed incorrectly. You may not realize it, but many of the books from Kaplan, Princeton Review, Barron's, Peterson's, etc., are FULL of typos, especially in the answers listed in the backs of the books. <br />Whew! That's a lot of info, huh? I hope it's helped. Good luck on your test, and trust me--this is the first book you should buy!!	2001-12-26

First, if you are unfamiliar with the GMAT, here's a quick overview of the test: The GMAT consists of three sections: one verbal section, one math section, and the essays. In the verbal section, you'll have 41 questions consisting of approximately equal parts of reading, grammar, and something GMAT calls `critical reasoning.' You will see three or four reading passages (like those on most standardized tests), some grammar questions (which require you to figure out what is the best way to put a sentence in English), and some critical reasoning questions, which are basically logic questions.<br />The GMAT, like the GRE and the TOEFL, is an \\"adaptive\\" test. This means that the test is designed to feed you questions that it has determined to be at your level. For example, your first question will be a medium difficulty question; if you answer that one correctly, you'll either receive another medium-difficulty or a hard question. As you continue to answer questions correctly, you'll get hard questions on the test. Conversely, if you start to miss questions, you'll get easier questions. This new format may not seem that important, but in fact, it is important to consider this when you are talking to other people about the test. Essentially, almost everybody who takes the test will say the same thing: \\"Whew! That was hard!\\" The test is hard because the software is giving you hard questions. So, when you read other reviews of GMAT books and questions, you need to keep in mind that people are commenting on the level of difficulty of the practice questions in different books compared to their GMAT, and your GMAT will likely be different. So, in a word, it's important to get a book with a wide range of questions of differing difficulty levels.<br />Here's what you'll see on the GMAT: On the math section, you'll see 37 questions. You only need to know algebra and geometry to answer these questions, but some of them are pretty tricky. There is no trigonometry or calculus on theGMAT. Some of the questions that you will have to answer are `data sufficiency' questions. These questions present you with some information, and you have to decide whether a math problem can be solved with this information. <br />Finally, the GMAT requires you to write two essays; one of them is a standard essay, and the other one requires you to analyze the reasoning of an argument (most schools pay more attention to your verbal and math scores than they do to your essay scores, though). All in all, the test will take you at least three and a half hours to finish, pretty long for most of us!!<br />Now, about the Kaplan book. This book is without a doubt the best prep book available to the general public. There are other materials available, like the materials Kaplan and Princeton Review use in their courses, but you can only get those if you join their courses or buy them used from an on-line auction site (not too hard to find, believe it or not!!). I like this book more than the Princeton Review because this book has more practice and it's material is more in line with what you'll probably see on the GMAT. The Princeton Review contains some material that is not quite the same as what is now appearing on the GMAT.<br />If you are considering buying this book, do yourself a favor and get the one with the CD-ROM. It is, without a doubt, the best tool you can buy to train you on the GMAT and is easily worth the price of the book. Personally, I don't care for the navigation system of the software. When you first load it, a little man in a flannel shirt appears and starts talking to you, asking you how you'd like to prepare. Although menu options like those we see in most Windows applications appear later, they do not at first. If you hit escape a couple of times, you can get away from this well-meaning guy and go right into doing the exercises. The thing about the CD-ROM is that it has much more material than the book does--more exercises, more explanations, and morepractice questions. One final important note about the CD-ROM, though: It \\"learns\\" your strengths and weaknesses and adapts itself accordingly. Therefore, if you use it for a long time and improve a lot, you might not get the hardest questions available to you. If you uninstall and reinstall the software to erase the data that it has recorded on your abilities, you can start afresh. Also, this means that the CD-ROM is designed to work with only one student, so you shouldn't share it with a friend.<br />The general technique of this book is to introduce you to the most common question types. In each section of the book, you will learn what kinds of questions GMAT likes to put on their tests and the rules and strategies for how to solve those questions correctly. This technique is a great start for getting used to the test, but in truth, you will probably need to study more after you finish this book; just this book is not enough for you to get an idea of the broad range of question types that you could see on the real GMAT. For this purpose, you cannot go wrong with the Official Guide for GMAT Review, or you could just download the practice software for free from the official GMAT web site.<br />Finally, if you are pretty good at math, you will find that most of the practice questions you've seen are too easy. However, the math questions contained in this book and its CD-ROM, you'll get questions that are just as hard or harder than those you'll see on the real test; the questions in other books (even the official GMAT book) are easier than the questions you'll see on the real GMAT if you are scoring in 90th percentile or above.<br />This book also contains a good math review, essay information, information on how to apply to B-schools, and general test-taking strategies (like how to grid your answers on your scratch paper--remember, we cannot mark the questions directly, since we are taking the test on a computer). However, unlike the Kaplan and Princeton Review GMAT verbal review books, it does not contain a grammar review.<br />A final note. This edition (the fifth) is printed on high-quality bond paper (shiny white!), not cheap newsprint, which gives the user a nice, happy feeling!	2001-12-26

Wow! This is the best book available, and I have seen ALL of them. It includes a great TOEFL CBT software program that has tests AND practice.<br />When you take the practice tests on the computer, you need to know about the tests. First, most of my students get a lower score on Test 1 than they do on the real TOEFL; consequently, most of my students are depressed when they take the first test. Most of my students get the highest scores on Tests 3 or 4; in other words, Test 1 is the hardest one.<br />The Listening and Reading Sections are all new; different from the previous CBT book. There's lots of practice in this book that reflects what the TOEFL is like now. The grammar section is the same as the previous Longman book that is so well-known.<br />This book, like most TOEFL books, doesn't really give strategies for taking the test. To learn the strategies, you should go to some discussion groups and see what others have to say.<br />I wish that this book included the cassette tapes for the listening section and gave more tips to students about how to take the test.	2001-07-28

Noah Webster wrote the first American English dictionary in the 1806 and his name has come to be synonymous with the word &quot;dictionary&quot; in the US. As a result, every dictionary in the US that wants to make any  sales calls itself a &quot;Webster's.&quot;<br />The M-W, however, is the  original and still the best. I have every major American English dictionary  in publication, and several British dictionaries, including the Random  House, the Webster's 3rd (the unabridged dictionary), Microsoft's  dictionary, the Oxford Dictionary, and several learner's  dictionaries.<br />Frankly, the differences among the top three,i.e., the M-W,  the Random House, and the Microsoft (on CD), are not that great--choose a  word like &quot;efficiency&quot; and see how each is defined. You might  think they were all working together. That said, I have so say the M-W is  still my favorite. Further, the M-W dictionary is consistently rated #1 in  surveys of academics and language scholar.<br />I am a professional language  and test preparation instructor and rely on good dictionaries for precise  definitions of words. The M-W consistently gives clear, accurate  dictionaries and apposite examples. One extra feature that helps word  lovers like me understand the words better is that M-W lists definitions in  the order that they came into use, with the most recent usage last. This  type of listing is extremely helpful for understanding how a word has  evolved and what it is about that word that remains and what is not  essential to the meaning. Such an understanding of words is essential for  GRE and SAT preparation and is one of the main reasons I regularly turn to  the M-W.<br />In short, it's your best option for an American English  dictionary.	2000-07-13

I am a professional TOEFL prep instructor in San Francisco, California and I have been researching, teaching, and writing about TOEFL for ten years. I have written a similar review for another edition of this book, so if you  see it, it is because there are different versions of the same book--some  come with cassettes, some with CD-ROMs, some with neither. So, here is my  review:<br />If you can only buy one book, this is the one.<br />However, I would  *not* recommend that you buy only this book--it is not enough. You need to  buy at least two other titles as well--the official &quot;TOEFL Kit&quot;  and the &quot;PowerPrep TOEFL&quot; software.<br />First, this book does NOT  have a computer test. Instead, it has some questions in the book that  simulate the computer questions. Half of the tests are written for people  who have to take the paper test, the other half are for people who have to  take the computer test.<br />If you can only buy one book, if you need a  review of grammar and other sections of the test, and if you want some  practice tests, this book is your best choice. It has a lot of grammar  explanations and lots of practice questions. The author, Dr. Sharpe, gives  HUNDREDS of practice grammar questions.<br />So, it is a great value--the  price is low, and you get a lot of questions.<br />However, the book is not  perfect. Some of the questions are old, and you will not see those types on  the TOEFL anymore. Furthermore, many of the questions are easier than the  real TOEFL, especially the reading sections. Many of my students have said  that the reading section is very, very hard and that they were not prepared  for the real TOEFL when they took it.<br />In short, if you can only buy one  book, this one is okay, but you really should buy official TOEFL materials  so that you will be ready for the real test when you take it.	2000-06-29

This book shows you what the TOEFL is llike, but it will NOT give you any deep preparation. It does not even come close to preparing you for all the material you will see on the TOEFL. The grammar is too easy, the listening  section is mostly just a list of idioms, and some of the reading passages  are about topics that TOEFL does NOT put on their tests.<br />You might think  this is a good book because it is long, but don't think that!  Most of the  book consists of practice tests--Princeton Review puts one question on each  page (trying to simulate what the computer will look like). For example,  the last 150 pages of the book are ONE test.<br />Finally, the CD-ROM is NOT a  Computer Test. You will get only some listening practice.<br />Good luck on  your TOEFL!	2000-06-29
US	51710600	RQ1HANZXRMUES	0375754172	772265690	Verbal Workout for the GMAT (The Princeton Review)	Books	4	11	13	N	N	Points you in the right direction!	First, if you are unfamiliar with the GMAT, here's a quick overview of the test: The GMAT consists of three sections: one verbal section, one math section, and the essays. In the verbal section, you'll have 41 questions consisting of approximately equal parts of reading, grammar, and something GMAT calls `critical reasoning.' You will see three or four reading passages (like those on most standardized tests), some grammar questions (which require you to figure out what is the best way to put a sentence in English), and some critical reasoning questions, which are basically logic questions.<br />The GMAT, like the GRE and the TOEFL, is an \\"adaptive\\" test. This means that the test is designed to feed you questions that it has determined to be at your level. For example, your first question will be a medium difficulty question; if you answer that one correctly, you'll either receive another medium-difficulty or a hard question. As you continue to answer questions correctly, you'll get hard questions on the test. Conversely, if you start to miss questions, you'll get easier questions. This new format may not seem that important, but in fact, it is important to consider this when you are talking to other people about the test. Essentially, almost everybody who takes the test will say the same thing: \\"Whew! That was hard!\\" The test is hard because the software is giving you hard questions. So, when you read other reviews of GMAT books and questions, you need to keep in mind that people are commenting on the level of difficulty of the practice questions in different books compared to their GMAT, and your GMAT will likely be different. So, in a word, it's important to get a book with a wide range of questions of differing difficulty levels.<br />Here's what you'll see on the GMAT: On the math section, you'll see 37 questions. You only need to know algebra and geometry to answer these questions, but some of them are pretty tricky. There is no trigonometry or calculus on theGMAT. Some of the questions that you will have to answer are `data sufficiency' questions. These questions present you with some information, and you have to decide whether a math problem can be solved with this information. <br />Finally, the GMAT requires you to write two essays; one of them is a standard essay, and the other one requires you to analyze the reasoning of an argument (most schools pay more attention to your verbal and math scores than they do to your essay scores, though). All in all, the test will take you at least three and a half hours to finish, pretty long for most of us!!<br />Now, about this book. This is a good book to help you raise your score on the Verbal Section of the GMAT, but it could be better. This used to be the only GMAT book targeted specifically at raising your score on the Verbal Section, but Kaplan has recently come out with their version, which is about the same price, but has over a hundred more pages of material; between the two, I'd probably go with the Kaplan, but this one is good, too.<br />This book is clearly targeted at the large middle segment of test takers, i.e., the bulk of the bell curve. If you are at either extreme, i.e., scoring below the 30th percentile or above the 80th percentile, this book probably won't help you much since it does not explain the harder GMAT verbal questions; i.e., the ones you are missing. The book does, however, have a nice reference section with the most common grammar rules and idioms tested on the GMAT.<br />For this large middle range, however, this book is enough to show you what you will see on the test, and if you're the type who doesn't like to leave anything to chance, this book will make a strong addition to your GMAT preparation library.	2000-06-25

Hey, let's face it--who is going to read 150 GMAT essays? Not me, maybe not you, maybe only a GMAT essay scorer. Most people can do fine with the samples included in the Official GMAT book or with the review included in  other books.<br />Furthermore, most schools don't really care too much about  your GMAT essay score--they care most about your Verbal and Quantitative  scores. Most of the schools that really care about your writing ability  will look at your answers to the essay questions in the MBA  application.<br />However, if you are the kind of person who really, really  *loves* to study as much as possible for a test, this book is good, *and*,  it is the only book on the market with this many sample GMAT essays.<br />All  the essays are well-written and they would receive high scores on the GMAT.  This book is good for people who learn from examples or for people who  really have no idea what to write. Non-native speakers of English should  take a look at this book if they feel like their writing style is not  similar to the English writing style.<br />In short, this book is full of  examples and is good for people who are not sure of what to write. Since  GMAT has said that all essays will come from these topics, studying this  book is good for people who are nervous about their essay scores.	2000-06-25

If only they would release more software like this, we would all be much happier.<br />The biggest problem with most of the other products out there is that they invariably have mistakes, have questions unlike those you will see on the real test, or give you a score that has nothing to do with the score you'll get on the real test. Furthermore, in every other book or software program now published, the math will be easy if you are scoring in the 90%ile and above. This product has NONE of these problems--you will get hard problems if you are good in math; and, since this product is \\"fresh,\\" it contains material similar to that currently on the tests. Some of the older materials are outdated and contain questions of a type no longer tested on the GRE.<br />So, and I almost hate to say it, this software is PERFECT! Well, almost perfect--the only real drawbacks are that you CANNOT review your answers after the test and there are no explanations. However, this program contains two full, actual tests--the score you get on this will be your real score. Even after you take the two tests, you could actually take them a few more times--the program actually contains something like a thousand questions and each time you take the test, you get a different variety of questions, depending on your level/performance.<br />In a word, this is a GREAT product. I wish there were more like it! <br />Good luck on your test!	2000-06-03

None of the other practice books can come close to the quality of questions  you will find in this book.<br />This book contains 27 actual, full tests  which were administered in the past. This is more than most people would  ever need to practice. However, this book contains NO explanations or  strategies--it's pure practice. If you need strategies or explanations, you  will have to look elsewhere.<br />Finally, some of these tests were given  years ago. Like all the other tests, the GRE has evolved and some of the  question types that you will see in this book will not be on your tests.  For example, the real GRE reading passages are actually pretty long (four  or five paragraphs) even though some of the passages in the book are quite  short (one paragraph). Moreover, students who can score in the 90 %ile on  the math section will find the math in the book too easy.<br />All in all, you  can beat the value. This book is the bible of GRE test prep.	2000-06-02

In a word, this is a great book!<br />We use this book as the basis for our GMAT preparation--we require all of our students to do all of the exercises in this book before they take the test.<br />This book has LOTS of practice  authentic practice questions. There is no substitute for official GMAT  questions--the questions in the practice books are just not the same. Many  of the practice books have mistakes and address topics that are not really  related to what you will see on the GMAT. It is very easy to doubt these  questions and to find fault with them. However, official GMAT questions are  not like that--you will almost never be able to find fault with  them.<br />However, this book has MANY problems--it is not a perfect solution  for GMAT preparation. Some of the questions are too easy, especially the  math questions--many of our students have said that the questions on the  real test are much harder than the ones in the book. Many TestMagic  students can get over 90%ile on the math section and they think the math in  this book is too easy.<br />Moreover, the explanations are hard to  understand--they are written for college professors!  It doesn't make  sense--obviously, if the questions were difficult for you, you need  explanations that are easy to understand. These explanations are written in  the same style as the reading passages--not very helpful for many  people!<br />In fact, many of our students quickly finish this book and need  more. Unfortunately, there are no other good materials available. This book  is not enough.<br />Finally, some of the reading passages are shorter than the  ones on the real test. We actually called ETS to complain about this and we  were told, and this is a quote, &quot;Well, we were just trying to give  people an idea of what the test was like.&quot; In other words, the reading  will be about as hard as the hardest passages in this book--prepare  yourself!	2000-05-25

However, it is not the easiest dictionary to use and understand because the language and definitions are not as clear and simple  as the language and definitions in other ESL dictionaries.<br />Even though  this is a good dictionary, I do NOT use it with my students for one reason:  the English in this dictionary is closer to British English and most of my  students need to study American English, especially my TOEFL students. So,  if you are studying TOEFL, I would NOT recommend this  dictionary.<br />However, if you are an intermediate ESL student or above, and  are studying international English, this dictionary is one of the best and  the price is great!	2000-04-14

Most of our students need much more than this book has to offer. Basically, Princeton Review does not give you all the information they have  because they want you to take their course. As they say, people sign up for  the course just to get the books!<br />This book will show you what to expect  on the GMAT, but it won't clear up any of the serious problems you may  have. For example, if you are scoring pretty high in the math, like 80% or  so, you will need to focus on more difficult questions and this book does  not have enough of them.<br />All of their sentence correction problems also  neatly fall into their categories, but, alas, these are not the questions  that most people have problems with, it is the tricky questions that people  have a hard time with.<br />The software is so-so. It's better than the  Peterson's (almost everything is), but not as good as the Kaplan. The best,  of course, is the official PowerPrep software. I have had many problems  with students getting over 600 on the Princeton Review software, but  getting 100 or 200 points less on the real test! <br />In short, you should  buy a good test prep book to use along with the official GMAT review. There  is no one book that will give you everything you need.	2000-04-05

Well,  part of the reason is that most of the questions from this software comes  from the official GMAT book and many students become familiar with that  book before they take the test.<br />What are some other reasons?<br />Well, the  math questions that you will get with this software are not as hard as the  real ones if you are scoring pretty high (over 80%).<br />The reading passages  on the real test are longer than the ones you will find in this program, as  well.<br />Finally, since the GMAT is now adaptive, the order of questions is  important--for example, if you excel at sentence correction and the first  few questions are sentence correction, then you will get a high score.  However, if you are not good at sentence correction, then your score will  be abysmally low.<br />In short, this is the best prep available right now,  but, if you can, wait for the 3.0 release in June of 2000.<br />Best of luck  on your test!!!!!	2000-04-05

This book is a good start, but it does not even come close to preparing you for all the material you will see on the TOEFL.<br />For example, the grammar review is TOO short for most of my students; I must use other books to supplement this book.<br />The book is pretty long, but most of the book  consists of practice tests--Princeton Review puts one question on each page  (trying to simulate what the computer will look like). For example, the  last 150 pages of the book are ONE test.<br />Finally, the CD-ROM is NOT a  Computer Test. You will get only some listening practice.<br />Get the Longman  book instead!	2000-02-24

The TOEFL materials from ETS are the BEST--they come with tapes, tapescripts, authentic scoring keys, and, best of all, REAL TOEFL QUESTIONS.<br />You cannot prepare for the test without REAL questions, and this book has lots of them --you will get a good idea of what will be on the TOEFL.<br />The problem with official TOEFL books, however, is that they do not give many explanations, they do not teach you grammar, and they do not give you any strategies to help you raise your score--they just give you the tests  and you have to figure out what the test is like by yourself.<br />This kit has a lot of TOEFL stuff for you to get started. For people who already have a pretty good level of English, it is probably enough. For example, you should take a practice test, don't cheat, follow the time limits closely, and find out your score. Whatever score you get on that test is your real score. If you score over 520, your English is pretty good. If you score over 600, your English is great and you can probably learn enough about the TOEFL from this set to get the score you want.<br />It is one of the best sets of materials you can get, but you should get the new TOEFL PowerPrep software so that you can understand how the computer TOEFL is.	2000-02-24

Kaplan is trying to trick you with the title!<br />It is NOT for the new computer test and it will NOT prepare you for the CBT TOEFL.<br />Instead, you should try to find the Longman CBT book. It is much better!	2000-02-11

I am a professional instructor and must warn anybody who is thinking of buying this book: it is simply *horrible*! There are many mistakes in the book, the grammar is too simple and the listening section is amateurish.  There are much better choices!<br />Try the Longman book! It is 1,000 times  better!	2000-02-07
