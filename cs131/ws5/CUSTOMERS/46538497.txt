These include the CIA agent Michael Scheuer's ( & Cindy Shaheen)\\"Jewish Lobby\\" excuse, the poverty excuse, and of course the Israel's \\"occupation.\\"      These are all proven canards, but most people are too stupid to realize that.    Mr. Timmerman takes them all on using the words & actions of the violators to make his case.  Other writers (Dr. Daniel Pipes) have done an excellent job of deciphering the hate-filled, murder-inducing words emanating from Mosques around the world.  Mr. Timmerman goes even deeper (literally, he traveled to Gaza and the West Bank) to interview the \\"everyday warriors\\" of the corrupt, criminal murderous Arafat and Abu Mazen Palestinian Authority.  Remember folks, this is a group that cheered when Binny and the Jets wiped out 3,000 people.  Basically, they blame all of their problems on \\"Great Satan\\" and \\"Little Satan.\\"  But Timmerman won't swallow their filth.  He wonders aloud where the $7 billion in international aid given to the PA has disappeared to (guess?  Arafat and his cronies accounts).     As for the future, the picture is just as grim.  Timmerman reviews hours of PA controlled media that glorifies martyrdom, describes Jews as pigs and monkeys, and generally has indoctrinated another generation with hate and murder.    Finally, Mr. Timmerman discusses the utter folly of the Clinton/Barak Camp David plan.  For Arafat, it was all a ruse as he made abundantly clear in Arabic:  Oslo, Camp David, etc. were all part of the \\"phased plan\\", a Koranic duty to deceive, regroup, and murder when stronger.  With PA officials (and leftist doves in Israel) own words, Timmerman makes it clear that this is not an issue of land for piece.  If it was a 21-year student wouldn't have been stabbed to death in the Old City days after Gaza was given to the Holocaust denying Mazen.    Folks, Mazen made it very clear he is not serious about peace.  In violation of the Road Map (which the left insists Israel accept), he has not cracked down and disarmed Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Fatah etc.  In fact, he invited them to join his government!  Moreover, again in violation of the Road Map, PA controlled media still encourages children and others to murder for their Palestine from the \\"River to the Sea.\\"     Great book by a courageous journalist.

While still a secular government, the nation hosts a large Muslim population.  Mr. Pipes insists that if the government there falls into the hands of Iranian style mullahs, it would be a devastating problem.  Turkey, of course, has been a loyal US and NATO ally; with pending EU membership that Jacques Chirac is actively blocking.  Turkey's citizens were passionately opposed to the liberation of Iraq and Prime Minister Erdogan is partially responsible for the rise in the insurgency in Iraq and US casualties because he did not permit the US to send ground troops from his country.  It has been widely reported by non-anti-US reporters (that is anyone not in the mainstream MSM) that this allowed the \\"rat effect\\" to occur: when the US did invade many of Saddam's homies, the thousands he released from prisons, Uday's fedayeen, and Baathist terrorist were able to avoid getting killed and regrouped to fight at a later date. <br /> <br />Mr. Pipes traces the history of Militant Islam, but focuses on the rise of Iran as an international sponsor of terror in 1979. <br />Of course he highlights the 40 plus years of UN/Chirac/UK/Bubba supported terror emanating out of Yaser Arafat's Palestinian Authority. <br /> <br />The author takes a shot at the US attempts to make our case to the Middle East \\"street\\" after 9.11.  I felt this was unfair, and sadly, I don't feel Mr. Pipes offers many suggestions to improve our approach (please don't misconstrue this as criticism of Dr. Pipes.  I love the author and subscribe to his e-mail/newsletter that reprints all his columns; you should, too)   <br /> <br />Overall, a fantastic, informative, and fair-and-balanced tome. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-17
US	46538497	RXXM7LCMZ74EE	0060746408	182691534	Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits, and How Baseball Got Big	Books	5	3	7	N	N	Road beef, buttocks shots, and a 3.9 40?	Quite frankly, I had no intention of reading this book until the steroid issue blew up hard in baseball's face during the hearings on Capitol Hill.  Despite sanctimonious calls from writers--sports and political alike--for Congress to stay out of the issue, the hearings were very, very useful.  Watching Mark McGuire essentially admit being a roid boy, Selig giving dirty looks, and the initial refusal of baseball to cooperate with the proceedings were all very insightful to me.  But, then something happened: Canseco severely backtracked from the claim in his book that everyone should juice.  He sounded genuinely repentant on Hannity and Colmes.   <br /> <br />Jose assumes the reader knows far less about steroids than he, and while I've never been called the \\"chemist\\" or the \\"godfather of steroids\\", I know quite a bit.  Actually, I agree with a few of the things that Jose says about steroids/growth hormones.  More on that later. <br /> <br />Canseco is a profoundly bitter man because he feels he's been blackballed out of the league, preventing him getting the 20 or so home runs he needed to hit 500 and a spot in the hall of fame (don't count on it Jose, you were a one dimensional player shortly after your 40-40 season).  He's angry with everyone and uses this book to assault numerous people. <br /> <br />It's a shame, because I want to like Jose.  His family escaped Dick Durbin/Howard Dean/MoveOn.org/Hillary/Kerry/Edwards favorite gulag:  Castro's Cuba.  And, generally speaking, I liked him as a player.  Perhaps this was because I am a bodybuilder, too, or I just admired the fact he seemed to take training for baseball seriously (as opposed to fat players that have to get in shape in spring training).   <br /> <br />Jose really tears in to journalists for a double standard with black and Latino players involving off the field problems.  He claims that players like Cal Ripken and Mark McGuire would have escaped scrutiny for his numerous run-ins with law enforcement, but I'm not buying that.  I think most fans give players a second chance--or third, and journalists are no different (otherwise the wife-beater Jason Kidd would not have been subject to a somewhat flattering article in SI shortly after he wailed on his wife/daughter's mother). <br /> <br />Canseco is right that the US position of classifying 'roids with coke is silly and counterproductive.  Bodybuilders all know someone or have read stories about these elaborate DEA undercover operations to nab what?  Some big dude selling prescription drugs for cosmetic reasons.  It seems like a waste of law-enforcement resources.  Jose completely ignores and glosses over the side effects of steroids:  gyno (man breasts), possible liver and heart damage, acne, hair loss, and 'roid rage.  He claims RR doesn't exist, but if you make a cocky dude grow from say 200 to 250, well, we've all seen these guys walking around with chip on their shoulders.  As for the other potential side effects, he says that is only from steroid abuse.  Well, what is abuse?  Trust me, today's pro bodybuilders are abusing, using massive, massive, amounts of juice and diuretics, and that \\"sport\\" has been ruined by these monsters.  The gradual increase in size of the average NFL lineman over 300-350 lb., Canseco correctly points out, is another sign that abuse is rampant (at least the NFL cares enough to test their players).  Also, Jose is right when he says these drugs have legitimate uses for athletic development or general health well being.  Here again though, he ignores the fact that they are illegal. <br /> <br />It's fascinating reading Jose talking about how prevalent the use of steroids were in the league and the constant MLB player discussion of the issue.  Canseco knew the legal risk; did all the others?  Jason Giamabi admitted in his illegally leaked grand jury testimony to even purchasing them in the parking lot of a Gold's Gym in Las Vegas!  Canseco goes on to say that he lectured/informed team trainers and players throughout the league.  He should be happy he's only done three months in the hole rather than the lengthy jail sentences convicted steroid dealers often receive. <br /> <br />Canseco dishes a cheap shot at President Bush and his stance on steroids.  He claims GW must have know he was juicer when he owned the Rangers.  Of course, he relies on the hack Clinton crony/Paul Begala for ammunition here, quoting him directly. <br /> <br />We also get the obligatory discussion of groupies (the Road Beef reference), strip clubs, and players cheating on their families (it can't just be wife cheating when you have children).  Thankfully, he exonerates the great Roger Clemens completely here.  He claims he's the only player he knew that didn't cheat.  We also get the dirt on his almost relationship with abortion loving (one media report has it at five), Jew pretending, Madonna. <br /> <br />As other readers have said, Jose seems to genuinely love his child, Josie.  He was also close to his mother.  He had a hard-driving, but apparently loving father. <br /> <br />My favorite chapter is about the umpires.  He claims that many are cool, and can be talked to/argued with during the game, but he calls out several of the nasty ones.  My favorite line in the book was from an umpire who told Jose when he was arguing over a called strike from Frank Tananna, \\"Son, that is a hall of fame pitch.\\"  Meaning of course, that some players have a different strike zone, just like Michael Jordan traveled, Shaq charges (and gets hacked), and Deion Sanders held in coverage.  It's one of the few light moments in the book. <br /> <br />Despite Jose doing a great job in exposing all the cheaters in baseball (paging Barry Bonds and his flax seed oil), he is wrong to diminish the risk of steroid use.  He claims just the opposite, but clearly his massive size contributed to his and \\"Big Mac's\\" early exits.  Sometimes, weight lifters muscles become stronger that their skelature can handle,resulting in frequent injuries. <br /> <br />One side note, Canseco claims early in the book that he ran a 4.3 40 yard dash.  I couldn't wait to question this in my review.  Then, later on he says he ran a 3.9 40!  I think that would be a world record, however, I was unable to find that statistic online.  I know the amazingly fast Deion Sanders ran a 4.2 40, so you can be the judge. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I sincerely wish Canseco the best in his \\"new life.\\"  If nothing else, his lovely daughter needs him to be there for her.  He makes it clear to the reader; he only wants to be loved. <br />	2005-07-31

Children's Provocative Communication: What It Means and What to Do About It	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Forces some soul-searching, not perfect for everyone	Please don't let my title distract you, this is an incredibly informative and helpful book, but I would like to address two issues I have personally with it.  First, I don't buy that all the evil things children sometimes say are innocuous.  Yes, telling g-ma she smells is innocent enough, but my experience is that when my daughter told me she hated me, at least partly, she meant it.  To just shrug the comments off and to get at the \\"root causes\\" as the author suggests would be highly myopic.  Again, for many the comments may not be as mean-spirited as I thought they were.  My second minor quibble with this great book would be that the suggestions he provides are really best for married (or divorced and civil to each other) parents.  Oh sure, he instructs the separated parents to \\"get on the same page\\", but that is not always possible, so for divorced people there may be better tomes.  One more point prior to the actual review, I greatly admire that the author takes on his critics directly and forcefully.  More on the critics later...  Initially when my daughter started saying things entirely inappropriate or mean, I assumed she learned them from an aspiring gangsta (loves thugs 50 cent, Eminem, etc. and yes they are talented) friend who is slightly older.  My imploring her that talking like that was wrong and that she would be grounded was not working.  Finally, when not getting her way one day, she said, \\"I hate you.\\"    I completely lost it.  I didn't get incredibly angry, rather, I became quite despondent.  I told my ex about it and suggested her comments about me were contributing to the problem.  She disagreed, and said basically that it was my fault/problem.  Like any parent would I'm sure, I was very upset about the drastic decline in our relationship.  Amazingly, despite sharing my situation with friends and family, no one offered suggestions or support.  Partly, I'm sure, that is because I did not properly \\"nip it (her behavior) in the bud\\" in their opinion because I don't believe in spanking.  Hence, it was my fault.    Dr. Fleming forces each and every parent to look in the mirror and think about how their behavior may be compounding the problems you are experiencing with your children.  People that are screaming constantly can't expect children to not model that behavior.  He focuses on several other parental patterns and their long-term deleterious effects.  This can be very helpful in analyzing your situation.  Personally, I didn't yell much at , but I did learn a lot about how to handle situations.  Dr. Fleming thoroughly discusses specific scenarios and how to handle them both immediately and long term through consequences for the child's actions.  This may be where Dr. Fleming's critics take aim.  He does not advocate spanking.  I personally completely agree, but I do know others that feel that the end of spanking is the downfall of civilization.  Somehow, this has become a liberal/conservative issue.  Frankly, I don't get it, but when I told the same people the suggestions in the book, they said invariably that it was coming from a West Coast/liberal/leftist.  Whatever!    This book hopefully will help my relationship with my daughter; hopefully it will help you, too.    Thank you Amazon.com and we are STILL waiting for blogging abilities.	2005-07-25

Interestingly, Lebanon is still struggling to rid itself of Syrian occupation.  They have gone from the vegan dictator Hafez Assad murdering opponents and journalists to the Syrian optometrist dictator murdering opponents and journalists (another killed last week 7/2005). <br /> <br />In this review, I will attempt to explain the story, the left-wing/doves reporter's views (and on so many levels his mistakes), and most importantly to Americans who love and support Israel, the correlation between Israel's actions and our \\"War on Terror.\\" <br /> <br />First to the journalists, the main one being the left wing newspaper Haraatz Ze'ev Schiff.  As the brilliant reviewer givbatam3 points out nearby, Mr. Schiff is a member of the Israeli left/dove/Peace Now group.  This \\"coalition\\" consists of myopic people (with all due respect) that don't seem to understand good and evil.  Just as our great President Bush was criticized for denouncing the \\"Axis of Evil\\" (he forgot to mention Syria and the House of Saud), these doves conveniently choose to ignore the problems with cooperating with our/their enemies.  This is what lead to the fraudulent Oslo accords and the creation of the terrorist supporting Palestinian Authority.  It is this \\"authority\\" that unleashed a wave of terror on Israel immediately after Clinton helped the murderer Arafat receive a Nobel Peace Prize.  Fittingly, Arafat walked away from the Clinton/Barak  plan in 2000, which would have created a Palestinian state, which to this day (7.8.05) does not exist despite the charade of the Road Map.  The authors accuse Prime Minister Sharon of illegally leading Israel into the war in Lebanon.  Most of the books I've read about Israel seem to have been written by journalists out to discredit Sharon.  He seemsto be the Donald Rumsfeld of Israel.  I don't live there so it is impossible for me to get a read on the situation, but he WAS democratically elected, so most of the voters must disagree with the left's assessment of Mr. Sharon (yes, I know his \\"disengagement\\" is an illegal abomination, more on that later.  Wear Orange to support the settlers.) <br /> <br />On page 39, Mr. Ze'ev describes Sharon as \\"a cynical, headstrong executor who regarded the IDF as his personal tool for obtaining sweeping achievements-and not necessarily defensive ones-and a minister prepared to stake the national interest on his struggle for power.\\"  Those would prove to be the \\"kindest\\" words he would have for Mr. Sharon.  On page 58, he accuses Sharon of implementing a quasi-coup d'etat. <br /> <br />And on and on it goes.  The author also accuses Sharon of duping the American government, details forthcoming. <br /> <br />Later on, we learn of the \\"courageous, freedom fighter\\" (my emphasis) Arafat's decision to deploy all Palestinians including 12 year old boys to kill Israelis.  Of course, to this day the PA affiliated Fatah and other groups use children to murder Israeli civilians (the best non-child attack recently was the Palestinian woman who was granted permission to receive medical care in Israel who tried to kill innocent Israeli doctors/nurses using \\"bomber pants.\\"  Great video of her discovering the bomb wouldn't activate, however US MSM {mainstream media} other than FOX refused to air it.) <br /> <br />On page 92, we learn of Arafat crony and current PA leader Abu Mazen's (the same Oslo and Road Map violating, terrorist supporting/enabling, holocaust denying, chain-smoking Mazen that GW brazenly brought to the White House) recommendation to target specific ethnic types of Jews for murder. <br /> <br />Throughout the story, if indeed the cabinet was mislead, we learn that this deception had negative military preparedness consequences.  Specifically, a failure to call up the reserves. <br /> <br />To his credit and unlike journalists Robert Fisk (Pity the Nation) and Thomas Friedman (NY Times, From Lebanon to Jerusalem), Mr. Schiff reminds us of the level of terror practiced by Ray-Ban Wayfarer wearing Arafat even inside his own PLO.  On page 147, we learn of Palestinians killing Palestinians that were given the chance to evacuate an area prior to IDF action.  In this episode, three children were gunned down in front of their father. <br /> <br />On page 149, the authors engage in a disgusting bit of analysis about the minds of IDF members.  In discussing a particularly brutal phase of the operation, the author's ask \\"was it perhaps fueled by an even deeper sense of vengeance for all the harm and hatred that the Jews had suffered at the hands of others over the centuries?\\"  And further, \\"How would the grandparents of these boys have reacted to the scene of mayhem...?\\"  Are you kidding me??  These members of the citizen army were probably quite sick of repeated murders of innocent Israeli citizens and committed to seeing their country living in peace.  Meanwhile, the UN, the left/doves, the media, and others seemed to downplay or turn a blind eye to Arafat's involvement in the many terrorist attacks conducted by the PLO prior to the Lebanon operation.  In my humble view, something had to be done.  Prime Minister Begin agreed with Sharon's initial plan on eliminating the terrorists in Beirut.  <br /> <br />Page 152 features more America bashing, culminating in an accusation that the US was an Israeli dupe. <br /> <br />The story of the military operation is detailed completely.  And no discussion of the Lebanon operation would be complete without mentioning the incidents in the refugee camps in Sabrit and Shatilla.  I'll leave it for the reader to decide on this operation, but in short, Israel relied on their \\"allies\\" in Lebanon to rid the camps of terrorists.  Most assuredly, after the Palestinians brought havoc to these people, they wanted revenge.  The result: some civilian deaths to go along with the \\"clean up\\" operation and a rebuke of several Israeli figures including Prime Minister Sharon.   <br />Folks, war is not pretty and the US faced similar choices in partnering with the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan.  Many to this day say that is why we allegedly \\"lost\\" Bin Laden in Tora Bora instead of adequately deploying our troops on the Pakistan border.  General Tommy Franks says this would not have been possible and I believe him more than the Kerry/Kedwards crowd.  Our \\"ally\\" Pakistan would not have tolerated a US presence, given that they were one of only three governments with relations with the Taliban. <br /> <br />As for the author's attempts to rid Israeli society of Prime Minister Sharon, it didn't work.  He forcefully fought the charges emanating from the investigation into the Lebanon operation.  After Yasser walked all over Clinton in Barak in 2000 and launched/restarted the intifada, Israel voted for \\"Arik\\" and his platform of not negotiating with Arafat.  Sadly, no tragically, he is haphazardly implementing his \\"disengagement plan.\\"  Six weeks prior to its start, it appears the plan is not well thought out and polls show that Israelis are increasingly against it.  Moreover, turning land over to terrorist supporting Mazen will embolden those that seek Israel's destruction.  Israel expects terror gangs of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Mazen's own Fatah to immediately set up shop in the West Bank and begin terror operations.   <br /> <br />So looking back Mr. Schiff and Ya'ari, who was right?  Terror coddling doves such as Rabin (who at least acknowledged the danger in trusting Arafat) and Peres or Likud hawks such as Sharon (and Netanyahu)?   <br /> <br />Let the reader decide.  I know who I would trust with my security:  Likud members Sharon and Netanyahu. <br />	2005-07-08

To his credit, and it is the only positive thing I can say about the book, Mr. Fisk clearly states that his editors, or I should say his increasingly \\"right wing\\" editors, were not pleased with his coverage but continued it due to the conditions in the war-torn region. <br /> <br />You know when a \\"journalist\\" will only write terrorist as \\"terrorist\\", (similarly, Reuters refuses to use the word.  Instead, they use the word militants to describe the beheaders in Iraq) the tone for the rest of the book is set.  Sadly, but revealingly, Mr. Fisk makes it appear that most of the journalists covering the conflict share his anti-Israel pro-\\"freedom fighers\\" views (the eventually kidnapped Terry Anderson said all the parties should be called terrorists). <br /> <br />Amazingly, at least in the copy I received, there were no pictures at all.   <br /> <br />Mr. Fisk at every opportunity diminishes the threat Israel faced with the UN/Arab backed PLO operating in Beirut.   <br /> <br />A truly horrific case of biased journalism from a writer from the country that brought us \\"sexed-up\\" lies and other media (MSM) distortions.	2005-06-25

Of course, he used it for an individual/enemy who is trying to stop the Hillary for Socialism Presidential campaign).    Congratulations to Mr. Friedman for writing a beautifully illustrative guide to why he hates Israel and why I hate the MSM (except Wash. Times, instead rely on Little Green Footballs, Powerline, and Michelle Malkin's blogs).  He must, because he joins Robert Fisk (of Pity the Nation) and Reuters in writing terrorist as \\"terrorist\\" and Reuters which prefers \\"militants\\" to describe the head choppers of Iraq.  He attacks Israel at every turn in the story.    As for self-loathing, no self-conscious Jew could write such a book filled with slanderous comments about Israeli leaders and the country itself if he didn't have some issues with Jewry.  He essentially makes the point that the very founding of Israel is a deception or lie, victimology he seems to imply.    Meanwhile, Mr. Friedman performs an seemingly endless Freud-like psychological evaluation for all the parties in the story, but he saves his big guns for Menachim Begin and Ariel Sharon, with their supporters, i.e. voters as collateral damage.    It amazes me that journalists like this still have credibility with anyone.  Of course, he does work for the New York Times, so they allow his anti-Israel anti-American vitriol.      To his credit, Friedman acknowledges that Arafat was (is at the time) a murderer who did NOTHING for his \\"people\\" while the world facilitated his corruption (thanks UN/EU/and President Clinton).	2005-06-25

Instead, I would recommend the bestseller  <br />\\"Hatred's Kingdom\\" by Dore Gold. <br /> <br />For her self-serving goal of clearing her family (or daughter's) name, the book is very useful.  Ms. Bin Ladin is about as Westernized as a Muslim can be, albeit one that is non-practicing.  Living in California and Switzerland, (and even Iran prior to the mullah takeover), convinced the author of the need for basic freedoms, i.e., speech, religion, suffrage, etc. <br />Why then did she marry a playboy Saudi, move to the kingdom, and then come back after each long vacation where she could drop the veil and other Saudi only customs.  Well, for the money of course.  Her husband was very wealthy, and this presented Ms. bin Ladin with a choice of incredible wealth, no rights to drive, shop etc., or leave the security this lifestyle brought.  She chose to bed down with the devil. <br /> <br />At every opportunity, the author portrays herself as a revolutionary in the Kingdom (egads, she reads!).  From her walks across the street to visit other Binnys, to her Thursday night parties, Bin Ladin is convinced she is helping bring much need change to Saudi Arabia. <br /> <br />In reality, she was a coward, a high priced call girl who sold her soul to live the high life.  Bin Ladin never fails to assure us that the reason she left SA was for her children.  Frankly, her words fall on deaf ears for me.  For example, she says she was shocked, SHOCKED, to see her Saudi educated children write in a notebook, \\"I hate Jews.\\"  Are you kidding me, Carmen?  All Saudis and most Middle Easterners at the time (and many today) indoctrinate their impressionable children with propaganda and victimization rhetoric about the \\"Zionist Entitiy.\\"  Of course, she soothes the reader with assurances that she told her teacher to not inculcate in her children to hate Jews and Christians. <br /> <br />The story progresses with the failure of her marriage to a guy in desperate need of some Prozac and Valium (anxiety attacks).  Ms. bin Ladin realizes that in Saudi Arabia men can instantly divorce their wives, take the children, and leave the women with no visitation (great stuff for an alleged US ally, huh?)  All of her servants and haute couture can't put Humpty Dumpty together again. <br /> <br />Sadly, bin Ladin takes a pass on discussing the Saudi/male/children issue completely.  It is an amazing fact that in the 21st century, an alleged US ally does not afford women ANY rights.   <br /> <br />To her credit, she calls out both the House of Saud & the family of Binny for funding Wahabbi type madrassas and jihaders.  She convincingly makes the case that it is nearly impossible to believe that both SA and Binny's crew did not know their copious donations were going to terrorists.  (Just like the Jerry Lewis-like telethons were for the families of martyrs, not the martyrs themselves.) <br /> <br />I do admire her for now having the courage to write about this misogynistic country, and its backward thinking citizens.	2005-05-31

This book does a fantastic job at documenting the history of terrorism emanating from Yaser Arafat and the Palestinian territories.  Just as importantly, it points out that Arafat has accomplished NOTHING for his people, spent billions of international donations intended for the \\"refugees\\", and used their plight to bask in the attention of the international press and world leaders (UN,Jacques & Bubba).    Also, it chronicles the \\"Chairmans\\" excellent use of propaganda on a gullible media and President Clinton (paging the BBC, whose correspondent cried when Yaser left his compound prior to dying).  One Arafat confidant said that Arafat lies in every sentence...if he didn't lie, he would apologize to you.    It's all in here.  From Yaser lying about his birthplace, his involvement in the 1948 War of Independence, to his comical condemnation of terror acts, while writing the checks to homicide bombers.    Incredulously, President Clinton fell for all of this.  He met with Arafat more than any other leader, pressured Israeli Prime Minister Barak into a ridiculously generous agreement at Camp David, which Arafat walked away from to launch the second (or continuous more accurately) intifada.

To me, a genius is not soemone who necessarily invents something, but someone who does something better or more effectively.  Example, Apple Computer deposed and reinstated CEO Steve Jobs would tell you invented the GUI (graphical user interface), hence he's a genius in his not humble opinion.  Wrong liberal Steve, Bill Gates brought the system to the masses, so he is the genius (and thus the target of protectionists like Eurotrash (Mario Monti) & US government regulators and business crybabies such as Real networks Rob Glaser, Larry Ellison, Scott McNealy, etc.)  (Jobs wins big for the iPod however.  Although, he should watch out for \\"video iPods\\" and cell phones with MP3 capabilities.)  (Special mention for the great Steve Case & Marc Andreesen (sp?) of AOL and Netscape here).    In Yogafit, Beth Shaw ignores the obscure aspects of yoga, and instead focuses on its exercise related qualities.  This is in direct contrast to many in the yoga community (excluding the great Baron Baptiste and a few others).  If there are three components of fitness--flexibility, strength training, and cardiovascular work--Ms. Shaw knocks out two of those.  Unlike the Ashtanga/Power Yoga crowd, she does not claim that Yogafit will satisfy your cardio needs.  The Ashtanga/Power Yoga leaders maintain that due to their focus on tai-chi like connecting moves, the bandhas, and heat, that their workout is satisfactory for a cardio workout.  I respectfully disagree.    Ms. Shaw uses 50 postures, which is a great start for someone beginning a fitness routine.  Clearly, as someone who does Hatha yoga, I don't feel that is a satisfactory asana sequence for an advanced practioner.  However, her workout will certainly be a challenge for most.    Ms. Shaw chooses not to use the Sanskrit names for the postures, which I think is a great idea and less intimidating to new practioners.      As a workout, I feel that by adding dumbbells for poses like Warrior and chair, you can greatly enhance the effects.    Overall, a terrific book.  Ms. Shaw should publish a new, improved version.    Finally, the shrill response from some of the more militant members of the yoga \\"community\\" who ostracize Ms. Shaw (paging Yoga Journal magazine) (and the great Steve Ilg of \\"Wholistic Fitness) is entirely inappropriate.  Having said that, for a fair & balance contradictory review, please see that done by reviewer dnk_dnkboston.    Namaste,	2005-05-27

They lost ALL credibility by removing Dr. Kissinger and fawning all over Richard Clarke) determing why 15 of the 19 hijackers were delivered from the House of Saud. <br /> <br />It's simple:  Wahhabism, as it is created, fostered, and exported in incredible amounts by our friends, the Saudis.  Ambassador Gold documents the entire history of hate being preached in Saudi Arabia and it's troubling relationship with the country's leaders and its role in creating Bin Laden and like minded jihaders .  In essence, the clerics in SA run the country like the mullahs of Iran, just more discreetly behind the scenes.  The effects are no less dangerous.  In the mosques and schools, daily invective of anti-Christian (American) and anti-Jewish (Israel).   <br /> <br />Not satisfied with complete mind control of Saudi citizens, and using the vast wealth of the country from petro dollars, Saudi Arabia has exported their militant form of Islam throughout the world including Pakistan, Yemen, the Philipines, the Balkans, and many other areas. <br /> <br />Mr. Gold chronicles the history that the Saudi Royal has with the Wahhabi hating clerics.  In return for large sums of money to spread their form of Islam, which singled out other Muslims as well non-Muslims, the clerics would not agitate for a cleric run state and sharia law. <br /> <br />Mr. Gold leaves us asking incredulously, why didn't we expect this before 9.11.  The al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda-linked bombings in 93, 95, 96, 98, and 2000 can all be tracked back to the Saudi approved clerical rulings and fatwas advocating jihad against all \\"non-believers.\\"  The book details the complete intransigence of the Saudis during the investigation of the Khobar Towers bombings of 1996.  President Clinton even visted the country to get their assistance. <br /> <br />And for the leftists who dismissed Saddamand Bin Laden's cooperation in terror, the author reports on historical ties between secular governments and Bin Laden.  They shared two common enemies:  The United States and Israel. <br /> <br />I wish Mr. Gold would have explored more deeply the actions the US and the world should take with the Saudis.  Clearly, the US could use a new energy policy (drilling in Alaska should have been a no brainer).  It severely disappointed me that President Bush had Prince Abdullah to the ranch, especially after hosting Prime Minister Sharon.  Mr. Gold does point out that the violence inspiring sermons can be viewed as a violation of international law and definitely of President Bush's \\"You are either with us or the terrorists\\" edict. <br /> <br />Mr. Gold does a good job at assuring us that Islam is a religion of peace, but offers little proof of that. <br /> <br />Overall, an incredible book, well-researched, and further proof of the need for the US to listen to neocons like the editors of the Weekly Standard, Wall Street Journal, National Review, and Little Green Footballs (I believe) and reevaluate our \\"special relationship\\" with the House of Saud. <br />	2005-05-24

Where do I start? First, I love bodybuilding. I read all of the muscle magazines every month, and have followed the \\"sport\\" for almost 20 years. Mr. Wheeler, who never misses a chance to remind everyone that he is a Christian, must not be 100% converted yet, because he lies throughout this book and wastes valuable paper with this gutless tome. For those who don't know, Mr. Wheeler has been one of the top ranked bodybuilders for over a decade. He recently had a kidney transplant because of a rare kidney disease that has tragically stricken NBA superstar Alonzo Mourning and Sean Elliot. The fact checkers, or is that liar enablers, that allowed Mr. Wheeler to say that these athletes did not disclose their disease when they retired (Mourning twice) should be fired and never be allowed in the industry again because they both spoke about it when they retired. Wheeler's past steroid use did not cause this problem, allegedly.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  <br />Mr. Wheeler regales us, or is that bores us to death, with stories about his numerous sexual conquests, of course while he was in relationships.  <br />Wheeler details his troubling health problems because of his use of diuretics (taken to eliminate all water fromt the body to make someone look leaner). Amazingly, he collapsed at a show with the judges knowledge, and yet this supposed-truth-telling Christian, does not name those who knew about this and chose to ignore and enable this plague on our sport. Instead, Wheeler attempts to have his cake and eat it, too: put out a book to entice the legions of fans of bodybuilding, but because he is now competing again (drug-free???), he refuses to point fingers at a sport that has been ruined by bloated, drugged up freaks weighing 300 lbs. at 5-8-6-0. Wheeler had a unique opportunity to out the sycophants in the bodybuilding media, the pimp empire of Joe Weider, and the psycotic bodybuilders who have ruined this sport.<br />Wheeler refuses to even name the bodybuilder who famously accused him of having calf implants. This from a guy who claimed to be afraid of noone and brags of beating people senseless, but oh, that is because he was sexually abused, so it's ok, right.  <br />One of his most notable lies is that bodybuilding magazines had annointed him the best bodybuilder...ever. Not one magazine has ever said that about Wheeler, simply because it is not true. That isn't a subjective analysis, it's a fact. He never even won the Mr. Olympia, the most important bodybuilding show. Also, he plays \\"the media was out to get me card.\\" In fact, just the opposite is true. The press in bodybuilding don't really call anyone out because of their abusive, steroid-rage-induced attitudes; if they did, they would only be writing about the personalities of so many of these guys.  <br /> <br />His training section is stupid as well. He was being trained by world class trainers (Charles Glass for one), yet he supposedly did three hours of cardio a day (yes, THREE hours a day). Any person with even the most rudimentary knowledge of bodybuilding knows that this is training suicide!!  <br /> <br />His \\"bling-bling\\" descriptions would make P Diddy proud. By my count he had 11 cars at one point and 48,000 sq. ft. home.  <br /> <br />Another great \\"Wheelerism\\": he says there is a dearth of research on his kidney disease because it primarily effects African-Americans.  That's great Flex:  play the race card, too. <br /> <br />He glosses over his steroid use/abuse, again because he was afraid of offending others in the \\"community.\\" Pick up any bodybuilding magazine today and the descriptions of the current \\"stacks\\" of roids these freaks are taking will blow your mind. Bear in mind, these drugs are ILLEGAL. The reigning Mr. Olympia, Ronnie Coleman, was a police officer until two years ago. How do you reconcile ingesting massive amount of illegal drugs while serving as a police officer. Many of the athletes purchase steroids that are prescribed to horses.  <br /> <br />What a shame that honorable, decent men such as Lee Haney, Sergio Olivia, and many others don't get a chance to write books. Instead, a bible abusing, philandering, ostentatious, drug addict does, and yet doesn't have the courage to address the many issues ruining the sport.  <br /> <br />In light of the tragedy that has befallen juiceball, er, baseball, Mr. Wheeler's irresponsibility is even more apparent. <br /> <br />Thank you to Amazon.com <br /> <br />	2005-05-23

That's right folks, before anti-American terrorist lover Jacques Chirac (and Kofi/UN, Pooty Poot, China, and Gerhard) did everything in his power to stop the liberation of Iraq in 2003, he helped build nukes for a madman with a bad mustache, Saddam Hussein.  Of course, like ALL other Arab (except the now ostracized Egypt) countries at the time, Hussein was committed to the destruction of Israel. <br />  <br />Fortunately, with never before access, Mr. Clair does an excellent job in explaining the \\"do anything for money\\" (except work) mentality of the French government.  While the world deplored Chirac's actions, (including the communist supporting Le Monde?), he barrelled ahead and armed a country committed to destroying Israel that had publicly made its intentions clear!  The photo of Jacques with the butcher of Baghdad are priceless. <br /> <br />As for the drama of the secret raid, Mr. Claire explains it in true \\"Black Hawk Down\\" (by the great Mark Bowden, the movie, however, was completely sanitized to gloss over the factual account of Bubba and Les Aspin repeatedly denying adequate military hardware for the troops in Somalia to avoid \\"political ramifications\\"...otherwise known as committing perjury and being impeached) fashion.  You feel like you are in the seat of the American made and supplied F-16s (thank you Ronald Reagan's administration) as they swoop into Iraq through Jordanian and Saudi Arabian airspace undetected, sometimes flying as low as 50 meters to avoid radar! <br /> <br />As all good books on Israeli/Arab conflicts must do, Mr. Claire discusses all of the political and military leaders in detail. <br /> <br />I first heard about this book in the Wall Street Journal.  It's a shame the leftists in the MSM (paging Katie Couric) did not give this book more coverage.  The author has done an incredible job. <br /> <br />Thank you, Mr. Claire.

Mr. Boyne does an incredible job of explaining all the facets of this terrible war.  He investigates Israel's decision to not call up the their reserves (I believe 20% of the IDF is composed of reservists) & the mistaken belief that air power would overwhelm the Arabs as it did in 1967.  On the Arab side(mostly Egyptian), Boyne discusses the improved battle plan over the 1967 Six Day war debacle.  Of course, the Soviet Union was responsible for arming them and instructing in how to use the anti-aircraft SAMS that devastated the IAF. <br />Also, unlike the hideous \\"Eve of Destruction\\" book, Mr. Boyne keeps us up to speed throughout the book on the diplomatic actions that were occuring.   <br />Mr. Boyne does a great job explaining all the major players on all sides:  Henry Kissinger, Golda Meir, Moshe Dayan, Anwar Sadat, vegetarian Assad, but also other future figures Hosni Mubarak and Ariel Sharon. <br />Finally, he recounts in intimate detail the story behind the Henry Kissinger led US airlift that essentially saved the great State of Israel. <br />Thank you Mr. Boyne for an incredible book.	2005-05-12

Amazingly, he chooses to focus on the young Israeli couple torn apart by the war (of course, the whole nation's citizenery were torn apart as well), while completely ignoring the major players in the world (US, Soviets, etc.)  It is as if he was just trying to fill up the pages of the book while doing no research at the expense of the reader.  The great Six Day War by Michael Orin also delves into the incredibly important diplomatic efforts surrounding that war.  No war book can overlook the importance of \\"world opinion\\" at the time, but this one does.  Admittedly, the Israeli couple had a very interesting story to tell, but it adds nothing to the history of the conflict and the story finishes with a very incomplete conclusion on the two characters.  In contrast, many other great tomes (my favorite thus far is The Two O'Clock War by Walter Boyne) highlight the dire situation that Israel faced, and the necessary US airlift that arguably saved the country.  Also, Mr. Boyne discusses the many lessons learned by the Arab nations (mostly Egypt) and its effect on the Yom Kippur War.    Mr. Blum seems to have an axe to grind on the very controversial general and now Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.  It is well known that he was a \\"rebel\\" in both the best and worst meaning of the word, but Blum seems to obsess over the negative aspects and the government's repeated attempts to relieve him of his command.  Again, Mr. Boyne addresses this topic more fairly, pointing out that Sharon's soldiers loved, admired, and trusted him, and that his daring was often beneficial militarily.  Truly, a double edged sword.  Blum makes no mention of Hosni Mubarak's importance in the conflict.  Of course, the US \\"ally\\" (and recipient of billions in aid while his state controlled media incites hatred of Jews/Christians/etc.) and strongman, has ruled Egypt under \\"emergency\\" rule for over 20 years (since open to democracy by Condi &George...don't deny leftists!).  His later importance to Egypt is formed partially during the conflict.  I could go on, but suffice it to say that any other book you read on this amazing moment in world history would be better written and more informative than the Eve of Destruction.	2005-05-03

I approached his book from a reformed weightlifter/runner to now a yogi/runner's perspective.  First the yoga information:  Many modern and not-so modern yogis claim that yoga is all anyone needs as far as exercise, but I completely disagree.  Despite their attention to bandhas, tai chi like connecting movements, and yoga breathing, I don't think yoga alone is a cardiovascular workout.  Moreover, I don't feel that the combination of low plank, high plank, crow, and handstands is enough to develop upper body strength.  If you look at most yogis (no offense, please) such as Steve Ross (Inhale on Oxygen 6 a.m. weekdays), Bikram Choudury, and others, they don't look very strong.  The best in this area to me has been Baron Baptiste (he of the ubiquitous bandana) and his attention to \\"functional strength.\\"  Fortunately, Mr. Ilg politely calls the yogi community out on this subject and carefully illustrates the need to \\"strength train\\" in addition to yoga.  His High Performance Yoga (trademarked I believe) still uses these poses, but as a complement to the work in the gym.  Also, his yoga routine is functional not fancy, incorporating all the sun salutations and warrior poses, as well spinal twists, backbends, forward bends, and inversions.  Maybe most importantly he introduced me to a pose not found in many yoga books and not on Yoga Journal's website pose section:  the yoga squat (this should be called the Ilg squat).  It's a fantastic pose.  As for Mr. Ilg's strength training advice:  solid and proven.  He limits between set rest to 30 seconds and does power movements such as squats, stiff-legged deadlifts, benches, military presses, etc.  No high rep,\\"shaping movements\\" fluff here.  His cardio advice is also great.  No \\"just gardening is cardio\\" or park your car in a farther spot blather, but rather a discussion on the necessity of hard training such as bicycling, running, and more.    Mr. Ilg gets very, very, very deep into the meditation and spiritual  \\"stuff.\\"  He loses me here, but that is my weakness.  Hopefully, you will be able to embrace this important area.  Another area Mr. Ilg recommends that I could not survive:  media fasting.  I'm sorry, but I have to read the Journal/Times daily or I feel lost.  If you can do this, your journey will be more advanced than mine.  He doesn't say you have to do it daily, of course.  Nutritionally, I can't personally see eliminating meat & dairy without some heavy protein supplementation.  If I'm training two-three hours daily (Mr. Ilg's recommendation), I don't see how a diet high in fiber and natural foods other than meat and dairy can provide enough protein.  He may be right; it's just not for me.  Please, if you are considering getting \\"fit\\" realize that cardio, strength training, or yoga alone will NOT be enough individually.  You have to combine all three (throw in meditation if you can and of course nutrition).  Based on those proven facts, please welcome Coach Ilg into your life.  You will save a lot of money purchasing this one book, instead of several for strength training, cardio, and the often incomplete yoga books.  You won't be disappointed.    Thanks for reading.    P.S.  Attentive readers may note that I previously reviewed this tome.  I used some unfortunate and inappropriate words at the time.  I apologize to Mr. Ilg and the Amazon community for that.  Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa.    Updated 11.25.05.  For some reason when you Yahoo, Google, A9 yoga squat this review comes up, so I want to add a little bit more information.  I still don't understand why more yoga tomes don't discuss the yoga squat, so I want reemphasize how much I appreciate Mr.Ilg's contribution.  I do the yoga squat at least 10 times a day (always at least a minute).  When I get two minutes during work I do it followed by a one minute forward bend.  The yoga squat seems to put my whole body back into line and it unleashes an \\"energy flow\\".  Also, during my reqularly scheduled two daily workouts, I do yoga squats holding a 25 or 35 pound plate for 2-3 minutes.  It deepens the pose and feels fantastic.  Everyone should do the yoga squat (knee pain sufferers excluded, although it may help actually).      Update 12.6.06.  I just wanted to add another item to the Ilg Squat/yoga squat.  The great Steve Ross on his fantastic yoga show Inhale(Oxygen M-F 6 a.m. EST) showed a version of the yoga squat designed to deepen the pose.  He just set his feet very wide apart and squatted down.  Turning your toes out may help some people.  It felt awesome.    Again, big thanks to Mr. Ilg to paying attention to this incredibly important asana.	2005-02-12

If you would like to play the vinyasa game, this book is probably it.  Mr. Baptiste, like Beryl Bender Birch, claim that he invented \\"power yoga.\\"  However, others, like Bikram Choudury, claim it is useless and doesn't even exist.  They maintain yoga is hatha yoga, and other authors/yogis are pretenders.  I tend to agree with him quite frankly. <br /> <br />For those new to power yoga, ashtanga yoga, blah,blah,blah yoga, it claims to be far superior than hatha yoga (despite hatha yoga being perfected over 5,000 years) because of its focus on tai-chi-like connecting movements betweent the individual asanas.  Furthermore, they claim that this type of yoga offers a superior physical workout in both strength and cardiovascular effort because it is meant to be performed in a heated studio or room (90 degrees for Mr. Baptiste).  I doubt it, and it has not been my experience. (I have done hatha yoga 90-150 minutes daily for over three years, I lift free weights three times a week, and I'm a long distance runner) Power Yoga is beautful to watch and entertaining to do, but PLEASE, stop with the wild claims people.  Don't tell me that because the room/studio is oppressively hot that you get a superior workout for the heart. (Thy NY Times in August 2004 questioned if it is actually dangerous to do yoga in that type of heat) The book (and Birch's) goes on and on with these arrogant statements.   <br /> <br />Mr. Baptiste's order of asanas seems logical and it does produce a great workout.   <br /> <br />More generally, I find the wild health claims that Mr. Baptiste and other yogi/authors make to be VERY irresponsible.  They all seem to believe that yoga cures depression, hypertension, anxiety, hypothyroidism, asthma, etc.(you name it, they claim yoga cures it).  Oh, and it's THE best form of fitness for weight loss, too.  That is simply not true.  A combination of strength training and cardio (along with a sugar/trash carb restricted diet) is the best way to get fit.  Yoga asa complimentary addition is great, too.  Introducing fitness--any kind--into a non-exerciser's life will improve their health.  Yet, other authors don't make the reckless health claims.   <br /> <br />As for \\"dietary advice,\\" Mr. Baptiste recommends fasting and to consume whole or natural foods.  He offers little evidence of the necessity and benefits of fasting which led to a rather stern rebuke from the editors of Yoga Journal when they reviewed his book.   <br /> <br />The yogis are correct of course, you should not eat trash, no-fiber foods, sugar, and fattening foods.  Most yogis are vegetarians and against dairy consumption.  Yet, they offer little to no advice about how someone will meet their protein needs when observing this weight management system, especially those that run and lift weights like myself whose protein needs are greater than just a yogi or yogini. <br /> <br />I like Mr. Baptiste because he brought passion and energy to yoga, not to mention marketing.  I just wish he was more careful about the health claims he makes. <br /> <br />Again, if you are interested in a unique yoga workout, Mr. Baptiste is a great instructor and his books and DVDs are excellent. <br /> <br />Namaste, <br /> <br />As always, thank you Amazon for the excellent service.	2004-09-30

Our great and courageous (did I say great and courageous) president allegedly views people as those that \\"get it\\" and those that don't.  I look at the world of yogis the same way, and Steve Ross DEFINITELY gets it.  Most importantly, he calls out all of the other yogis that don't.   <br /> <br />Specifically, he indicts those that preach fanatical attention to perfection while performing asanas while not appreciating that the attempt itself is what is important (obviously not doing any poses \\"unsafely).  Anyone who has had the pleasure to view Mr. Ross's program on the Oxygen network, Inhale (check your local listings), is immediately struck by the levity and joy in the studio, hence \\"Happy Yoga.\\"   <br /> <br />In this book, Mr. Ross addresses the yogi \\"way of life\\" much more than the actual asanas.  The asanas have been around for over 4,000 years, and despite the claims of other practioners, beyond the \\"Power Yoga\\" movement and its connecting movements between asanas, not much new has occurred in the field.   <br />In a superior way than all of the other yoga books I've read, he explains \\"yogi bliss\\", nutrition, supplementation, the joy of music during practice, relationships, materialism, sex, and the \\"endless wanting\\" that leads so many (myself included) to unhappiness.  For example, he examines the folly of expecting a \\"soulmate\\" to make you whole.  Or, the expectation that a newborn child can complete you or make you happy (often to mend a fragile marriage).   <br /> <br />Mr. Ross emphasizes the importance of relinquishing any hate you have, to love everyone--and everything--uncondtionally, and the joy of laughter.  It may sound simple, but he does a wonderful job in explaining it. <br /> <br />If you don't agree with everything he says, at the very least his words will make you consider his (and the great yogis that he \\"trained\\" with) suggestions. <br /> <br />I urge everyone--yogis and yoginis and non-yoga practioners alike--to purchase this book, read it,re-read it, and save it for future reference. <br /> <br />Namaste, <br /> <br />As always, thank you Amazon.com (and A9 search) for the wonderful service.	2004-09-25

As the Amazon.com in-house reviewer notes, the author seems obsessed with pointing out that men do Yoga, hence the title.  Unfortunately, this is based on the ridiculous assumption that men never did Yoga.  Can we say Iyenger?  Or Baptiste, Yee, and many others. Silly, stupid, and insulting! <br /> <br />Having said that, the author seeks to \\"mainstream\\" Yoga (similar to the great Beth Shaw), by using non-Sanskrit names for the asanas.  I sincerely feel that this helps someone new to Yoga.  Mr. Capouya also spares the reader the preaching about the eight \\"limbs\\" of Yoga (non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing...) and the horrors of eating meat.   <br /> <br />The book is poorly laid out.  It bounces around from pose to pose interspersed with quotes from professional athletes and alleged Yoga practioners.  Sadly, they mostly aren't true Yoga practioners because they only do Yoga 2-3 times a week (often in a class).  Yoga is not weightlifting:  it is not mean to done every other day, but rather daily (talk to a Yogi about how terrible they feel if they are unable to do at least a 30 minute session).  Moreover, most Yoga books (Baptiste for example), advocate a 90 minute daily practice.  This book seems to feel that 60 minutes is adequate.  I disagree.  Anything less than 90 for me is inadequate.  But the use of the athletes quotes serves to perpetuate the notion that \\"real men\\" do Yoga, so I guess that don't need to do it that long. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book leaves out the variations inherent in all Yoga poses for beginners.  This is a grave disservice to Yoga.  Yoga is perfect for ANY-BODY.  Fat, thin, weak, non-flexible etc.  By using professional athletes as examples, Mr. Capouya may unwittingly intimidate someone less physically gifted. <br /> <br />It's worth a look, but I prefer Hatha Yoga Illustrated, Journey into Power (Baron Baptiste), and Liz Lark's (egad, a woman!)Power Yoga and Yoga for beginners.	2004-09-12

I am a test case for the efficacy of Mr...	Tastsouline's programs.    I have lifted weights seriously for over 15 years.      I also am a long distance runner.  I also practice Hatha Yoga daily for at least 75 minutes but usually 90 minutes-2 hours daily.  My free-weight program generally was done five-six days a week for 50-90 minutes.      After reading Pavel's tome, I decided that focusing on several exercises or movements, i.e., lifting, pushing, and curling,.  would free me up for additional cross-training.      He's right:  With my Pavel-influenced program, my body, strength, and fitness have improved, and in less time:)    Basically, Pavel emphasizes a major lifting movement that is also one of several \\"full body\\" exercises. Deadlifts attack not only the entire back, legs, buttocks, but also the traps, bis, and shoulders.  It has been empiracally proven that these type of movements ignite a flame in our metabolism.    Also, the pushing movement, the flat bench, is a great exercise.  I substitute heavy flies and leaning forward dips occasionally.    The other movements are basically a rear military press and barbell curls.     I do either overhead barbell extension, dips, or close-grips for my tris.    I also do standing one leg calf raises (for my one leg down dogs in Yoga).    In summation, this is a very informative and entertaining book.  Lifters, bodybuilders, and athletes of all shapes and sizes (you too laides:) will benefit from Pavel's recommendations and the extra cross training that you'll have time for.    As always, thank you Amazon.com for the outstanding service and value.  Also, for the communists complaining about the book price:  lighten up!  It's not easy to get a book published when you are a former member of the Russian Special Forces.    Update 12.18.05:  I'm not sure why more readers didn't find my review helpful, but I'll provide some more information today.  I took eight months off from free weights because I thought I'd be satisfied doing \\"iron yoga\\" and runnning.  I was horribly wrong.  Now, in about 3-4 months on Pavel's program, I'm in great strength shape and appearance.  (I got skinnier during the yoga/running only phase).    I had several concerns when I started back with Pavel.  I didn't think doing deads alone would be enough to bring back my lats.  I was wrong.  And, I thought lack of tri work would hurt me.  So, I added 10 sets of lying tri-extensions, overhead extensions, etc. to the routine.  Plus, I do 10 sets of calf raises and 10 forearm exercises.  My back is ripped, my lats, fine, and the rest fantastic.  During my chair and warrior poses in yoga, I use heavy dumbbells, so this definitely helps with the great condition of my legs.  Make no mistake, this is a great program.    Thanks Pavel!	2004-09-01

I personally wouldn't find a 26 asana sequence satisfactory, but judging from the Amazon reviews, many people do.    I do love two poses that Bikram recommends which others often  overlook or do differently.  His side bends are awesome.  I'm a long distance runner and I always do these prior to running, and of course during my daily practice (and in the afternoon session).  If you enjoy triangle and lunging side stretch, you'll love the side bend.  Also, his version of chair pose is incredible.  Doing it on your \\"tippy toes\\" is more challenging (I like to do it with a 25 lb. plate held overhead).    For some reason, Yoga Journal does not feature these two poses on their site.  As for the rest of the book, I would say it is an interesting read. His yoga health claims are irresponsible in my view, but he isn't the first yogi to make wild assertions that are often short on facts.  Bikram is sometimes scorned by the \\"yoga community\\" because of his intense, capitalistic/materialistic ways.  That doesn't bother me personally.  I still feel after reading about every yoga book I can find, that Hatha Yoga Illustrated is the best tome for non-power yoga.  Thanks for reading.  Thanks to Amazon for the great service.

I've read almost every book on weightlifting/bodybuilding to assist me in my training.  All of the books I've read for serious weightlifters have also given detailed descriptions on proper form.  In my humble opinion, the Ironman Magazine books are among the best, but so are the Joe Weider and Robert Kennedy tomes.  <br />Also, I find the author's vociferous condemnations of certain exercise techniques to be offensive.  For example, elite-trainer Greg Zulak recommends that a person doing squats would benefit from placing five-pound plates under his heals.  Mr. McRobert assails that opinion, arguing that it increases skeletal risk.  Ok, he is entitled to that decision, however, if someone reads the effusive praise of the other reviewers and uses this book as his only source of training information, he will be denied the chance to attempt a variation that may be quite helpful.  <br />The book is filled with these strident opinions.  Mr. McRobert's book is a valuable contribution to someone entering the &quot;iron game.&quot;  However, a new athlete should not use this--or any other--book as his only source of information.  Instead, devour as much information you can from the Internet, magazines, the library, Amazon.com, of course, and other bodybuilders.  (Most people are honored to have their opinion sought out).<br />In conclusion, this is a valuable addition to your training information; it should not be the only source of information for you.	2004-06-05
US	46538497	R6S8VH76TJFMF	0071383301	648090792	High-Intensity Training the Mike Mentzer Way	Books	2	15	23	N	N	Informative, but arrogant and insulting	Hello.<BR>Thank you for reading my review.<br />This book is informative and most people entering the \\"iron game\\" will find it helpful.<br />I don't think the late, great, Mike Mentzer controlled the content of the book too much, however.  <br />Unfortunately, the author goes off on how Mr. Mentzer was black-balled because he did not participate in the scam that is and was the \\"mainstream\\" bodybuilding market.  This group recommends almost every unproven supplement, and features training articles written by genetic freaks that ingest steroids, human growth hormone, diuretics, fat burners, etc.  (Some even have column discussing drug \\"stacks\\"). With all of those drugs, an athlete can train far more frequently and longer than a drug free individual.  That is a fact.<br />Mr. Mentzer stepped outside this groupthink and said that you don't need to train as freqeuntly or for as long as other athletes in his era were.  Mr. Little implies that this cost Mentzer the opportunity to reach the upper echelon of the sport.  He provides no evidence for this insidous charge, and then proceeds to condemn most of the other pro athletes of his generation.  Mr. Little even shows a picture of Mr. Mentzer reading a newspaper with a caption that describes how Mr. Mentzer reads to stay informed about things outside of the gym! What is that??  <BR>Further, he talks about Mentzer reading Kant and Descartes.  So.  I read those books and I'm not particularly intelligent.  Helpful, interesting and even enjoyable, yes, but reading philosophy doesn't make you smarter than someone else. The not-too-subtle implication was that the other elite bodybuilders of Mentzer's era were stupid.  Are you kidding me??  During their pro careers, Arnold got his business degree and became a very successful real-estate investor, Franco Columbo became a doctor, and Serge Nubret was a successful actor in France.  (Rent or purchase Pumping Iron for more information.  Mike Katz was a school teacher and great father).<br />Also, Mr. Little talks about Mentzer's good looks and how that was a first for a professional bodybuilder.  ???  Nubret was a legend for his appearance, and Arnold and Franco were pretty handsome, too. <br />As for the traing information.  It's all widely already known:  You should not train longer than an hour in each session, because you cease producing growth hormone after that.  You should only work a body part no more than twice a week.  Smaller muscles require less sets that larger muscles.  Slow execution on each exercise.  Arnold, Franco, and all of the other greats trained more, but it worked!  Of course the average person can't train like a professional, but this is common sense. I can't throw a baseball for nine innings at 95+ m.p.h. like Roger Clemens, either. <br />Avail yourself of the copious amount of information on the Internet, magazines, the library, and of course Amazon.com to assist you.  Also, ask other bodybuilders questions.  Most people are honored when someone seeks out their opinions.<br />Thank you again for reading my review.<br />R.I.P. Mr. Mentzer	2004-06-05
US	46538497	R3ECQY05P7WRSF	0736051228	703913569	Hatha Yoga Illustrated	Books	5	281	306	N	Y	The best Yoga book, period!  BUY NOW!	Hello. I am a bodybuilder/weightlifter and long distance runner who started doing Yoga in 2002 (I practice 6-7 days a week, at least 90-120 min. daily)after surgery to repair the L5-S1 disc in my back, which I blew out while running with a cold and coughing intensely (coughing, sneezing, and laughing allegedly places tremendous pressure on your spine).  I have read or purchased at least 15 books on Yoga.  This one is by FAR the best (9.5.04).  One pet peeve of mine has been hairy, anoerexic-looking, freaky looking Yogis showing off incredibly difficult poses that take years and years to master, if at all.  These authors and models are very normal looking and easy on the eyes.  This book does indeed display difficult poses, but also shows important modifications for those less accomplished.  The book shows the Sun Salutations of course, and dozens of other standing, seated and twisting, forward bends, reclining, arm balances and inversions. Each has a thorough description of the benefits and instructions with fantastic photos for all levels of practioners.  You will develop more lean muscle mass, lose weight, and increase flexibility and balance if you are serious about your training (obviously combined with a healthy eating style). The authors summarize several different workouts in a one-two page layout at the back of the book.      Another nice feature in my opinion, the authors don't ramble on about the horrors of eating meat, simply saying that it is an intensely personal decision.  Moreover, the authors refrain from outlandish promises that I have found to be either completely inaccurate, scientifically unproven, and/or lies.  Yoga is like any other form of fitness.  You get out of it what you put in.  Rather than making wild, unproven claims, the authors offer responsible descriptions of \\"potential\\" benefits.  I found this measured approach to be very refreshing.      Because I have read so many Yoga books, I have endured the many wild and completely irresponsible claims by many Yogis and even Yoga Journal magazine (weighing in on the dangers of genetically modified foods [tell that to starving people in Sub-Saharan Africa], peacefullness, and non-violence, yada, yada, yada).  The authors achieve a perfect balance in this regard.    This book is PERFECT for anyone from beginners to advanced practioners.    Also, thank you again to Amazon.com for offerring this book at a great price and of course perfect service.    Namaste	2004-03-24

I have been doing Yoga for a year and was looking for a book that displayed a wider range of &quot;exercises&quot; with descriptions of each.  While this book does in fact show 608 poses, it does not provide any instruction on positioning.  I use Yoga to complement my weight lifting and long distance running and this book does not do this.  Having said this, a professional Yoga instructor probably would know exactly how to do each pose and just having a visual representation may be quite helpful.  I highly recommend &quot;Journey into Power, How to shape your body, free your self, and transform your life&quot; by Baron Baptiste.  Don't be scared by the esoteric nature of the title, for me it was very thorough on the exercise part of Yoga.  I don't know why these people insist on attempting to inculcate this psycho-babble on people that may just be looking for exercise and the benefits of the relaxation.  No offense intended.	2003-07-13

I would give this book one star but there are probably some guys out there that do not know the amazingly simplistic things these guys tell you.  If you don't know to go to the dentist, not to wear sweatpants in public (see Seinfeld episode), and not let your hair grow down your neck, then buy this book.  Other facts, such as good places to meet women, i.e., bookstores, coffee shops, are common knowledge.  Some advice, such as first dates should be short and are best at coffee shops are intelligent but again should already be known.  Bottom line, I don't have &quot;game,&quot; and if you don't have that you aren't going to meet womeon.  This book helps you in the conversation department.  Other obvious directions are give up the cancer sticks and talk to all women.  I guess that works.  There is no magic pill guys, and this book won't help you.	2003-05-26

This book was recommended by a friend who knew that I was struggling with my daughter.  I'm a single father of a (as of 10.10.02) five-year-old daughter.  I have her everyday from after school, 3:30 to 6:30, and all day Sunday, and she still lives with her mom.  I was raised with a smack first mentality and her mother believes in spanking, too.  I decided early on that I wouldn't do that as it did nothing to improve my unruly behavior.  Having said that, I was very skeptical of this book but with the great reviews here at Amazon, I gave it a shot.  After reading about half of the book, I told my daughter I was reading a book about how we could better handle behavior issues.  She abhors me yelling, despite causing the need for it.  The book says that at that age, initially they might not understand the 1-2-3 explanation, but THE VERY SAME DAY, she understood.  It worked for everything from leaving the park earlier than she wanted, to not listening at the house, in other words, everything.  In fact, if I immediately got mad (this is addressed also at the end of the book under the backtracking chapter), she would say, \\"Hey, you didn't even count.\\"  Now, I have only had to use this a couple of times with my \\"old school\\" parents around, whom I know would prefer the spanking method, but the book does recommend strategies for dealing with skeptical loved ones, other parents, or friends.  Finally, the second portion of the book addresses the \\"start behavior\\" such as cleaning rooms, homework, etc.  While my daughter doesn't have as much to do as an older child, it has been very effective in dealing with these issues, too.  In a nutshell, I was a divorced, clueless, single parent who grew up virtually isolated from other kids, so I was very eager for advice, and quite simply this book provided it.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this book and it's recommended age range of 2-12 seems quite reasonable.  I hope you find it as useful as I did.	2002-10-10
