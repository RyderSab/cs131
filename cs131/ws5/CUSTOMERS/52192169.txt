A collection of Xi Xi's short fiction regarding life in the untamed and fascinating Hong Kong of the 1980s. This work puts you squarely in the middle of Hong Kong during  negotiations between  the British &amp; Chinese  government. In the first half of the 1980's, the Chinese and British  governments negotiated Hong Kong's future,  inducing  fierce soul-searching  and intimate scrutiny of society and  the general population.<br />Xi Xi  skillfully shows us by contrast and in-depth perception the real and  imagined, the new and the ancient, the infringement of Western culture and  local traditions; and she has created stupefying  narratives telling of the   expectations, dreams,  desires,  hostility and apprehension that  the Hong  Kong citizens found themselves inextricably snarled in during this   climactic time in their history.<br />Xi Xi has used her text in conjunction  with the pictures of  Rene Magritte. In doing so, she has blended an  interpretation of  images  Belonging to modern Western tradition with a  uniquely contemporary Hong Kong interpretation.<br />Most other books written  posturing  and speculating about the handover will be long forgotten after  the event occurs. The lovely and particular way with which Xi Xi has  written her work will guarantee that it  remains  a valuable resource in  defining the history of Hong Kong for decades to come.

They  provide the truth of death and dying, not some glamorized performance of  celluloid &quot;heroic death.&quot; <br />Having Multiple Sclerosis, I deal with a  chronic debilitating disease every day of my life. I know that I get  extremely tired of having movies, works of fiction, and well-heeled  &quot;personalities&quot; tell me how I should respond to the uncertainty  that MS provides. While MS is not termed a life threatening disease- it is  the leading cause of death of folks that have my form of MS. This book has  helped me to see that the wide range of emotions I go through, and the mood  swings my family and friends go through, are the &quot;normal&quot;  reaction to such illnesses. The common everyday people like me go through  the same thing as I do. We may not be Eric Roberts in It's My Party- we are  ourselves. Not  lavishly wealthy with access to the best health care and  support the world can offer. We are simply humans trying the best we can,  doing the most we can with a situation we did not choose for  ourselves.<br />The people in this book are brave, they are heroes, and their  stories deserve to be told.  It helps all who read it and/or discuss it  understand that death is a part of life, it is inescapable, and in the  barest of moments we are all going to have death as an extremely personal  experience.<br />Thank you Dr. Blau, a deep, and profound thanks to those who  opened their everyday lives to Dr Blau and showed us the humanity of  illness, of death.	1999-09-21

A determined Special Prosecutor, with an unlimited budget, turned loose with no one holding the reigns, almost brought the Presidency  crumbling to the ground. <br />Many people railed against the depth of  intrusion that was imposed on the first family.  But if you stop to think  about it, perhaps government was only getting a dose of their own medicine:   being repaid for their intervention and intrusion into the private life's  of its citizens. <br />In Edmund's book this intrusion is explained and  outlined in such a fashion that readers can understand and follow. In the  early part of this century America experienced huge creative and inventive  leaps. These advances made the inventors and the producers (makers) rich,  giving birth to the American Dream. <br />Seeing this, government decided they  needed more of a share- &quot;for the greater good&quot;.  Contoski details  how the takers (government and big business) have since intervened and  taken a larger piece of the pie by passing laws that benefit them and which  keep the &quot;makers&quot; plodding along a treadmill, chasing after an  &quot;American Dream&quot; that as been quietly stolen away from us bit by  bit. Never a fan of economics or finance- I wondered if I could provide a  good or objective review of this publication. Edmund has made this easy to  understand and an interesting read. You'll find yourself nodding your head  as you read his examples, and saying to yourself, &quot; Yeah, I can see  that now.&quot; <br />He fully explains the origins of the American system and  how it fed and nurtured an unprecedented number of &quot;makers.Then, just  as deftly he highlights the subtle changes in our political belief system  and orientation. These changes often so subtle that they have, until now,  remained unnoticeable. <br />This book should be required reading for every  registered voter in the U.S. <br />Amazing facts you can read about in the  book MAKERS AND TAKERS <br />1200 people die unnecessarily because of the Food  and Drug Administrations 5 year delay in approving       the drug  nitrazepam; <br />Over 100,000 people die from the FDA's 7 year delay in  approving beta blockers; <br />The federal government-while posing as the  protector of the environment-is the nation's largest polluter.       The  Defense Dept. alone generates more hazardous waste than the five largest  chemical companies       combined. Other sources of pollution include  federal prisons, hospitals-and even the EPA itself. <br />A million Peruvians  became infected with cholera-and 10,000 died-after chlorination of drinking  water       was stopped because of EPA policy. <br />Read how EPA falsified  sulfur dioxide emission studies in order to force stringent regulations on  utility       companies and other coal-burning industries.

Small publishers sometimes have difficulty with the layout, and editing of a small press  production. This  book is no different. While there are numerous editing errors, the book is  still worth a read in my opinion. Not  for the &quot;literary&quot; reader, but for the reader that enjoys   science fiction and or science in  and of itself- the book is quite well  done. <br />Is humankind ready for extraterrestrial contact ?  A mysterious  coded message from space arrives, leaving the characters  in Song of the   Swan to determine who sent it and why,  what it means, and if it means  anything at all. <br />The characters are a bit flat- however they serve their  purpose in  making the investigation into these questions understandable to  the average reader.  The destiny of humankind is in their hands, this small  group of scientists that were selected to  decode and understand the  message, so while the characters  may not excite you or intrigue you,   their mission certainly will. <br />The book is written with intelligence-  although the editing errors may prevent the pickiest of readers to agree.  D'Alembert does a great job of holding the reader's interest to the end.   It's a good quick one night read,  that will leave you pondering the future  of our planet. <br />Leslie Blanchard<br />Editor A Writer's Choice Literary  Journal ISSN: 1521-2319 [...] &amp; The Bear's  Den- Spoken Word Poetry [...] icq# 33958401	1999-04-20
