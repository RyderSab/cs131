A (young, hip) teacher is taking his class on a field trip to the library today!  He starts class out with a few questions for them to think about as they get a tour.  Once they arrive, Howard the (slightly nerdy, though young) librarian tells them out they can find and check out a book.  We go through the (poster filled) library, including a map to show us the layout, and see how to use the computer and then what it takes to get a library card.  <br /> <br />The pictures are bright and colorful, with a lot of extra stuff to look at, but not too cluttered.  Almost every page has a notebook of extra information about that particular topic.  The end of the book has an activity to turn your own books at home into a library, some fun facts, a glossary, an index and a \\"to learn more\\" section. Overall a well done book, nice and up-to-date.	2005-10-06

Many in New England were finding farm and agricultural work to be scarce, and money even more scarce, so families sent their young women up to Massachutsetts to work in the mills.  The Lowell Mills were unique in that they had boarding houses, a hospital and a dining hall.  Eventually, women moved on, and the Mills became more and more mechanized, as well as laws were passed to limit workdays and ages. <br /> <br />The book is divided into several chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of being a Mill Girl, including types of jobs in the mills, education and boarding house life.  The pages are filled with photos/drawings, documents and maps.  The end of the book contains a timeline, important people list, a \\"want to know more?\\" section and an index.  This is a well done book, filled with information, but not overwhelming.  You can easily pair this with Lyddie (Paterson) or The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire (Crewe).	2005-10-06

There are several different ways to approach a book about color, and this one takes a fun, rhyming way!  Each page has two lines of text, the last line rhymes with the last line of the next page, making each \\"verse\\" 4 lines long.  The lines are illustrated with bright, close photographs, including a pink ballerina, a pink piggy bank and a pink pile of candy hearts.  Almost every page has a small fact box with additional information about what is described on the page (e.g. cotton candy used to be called fairy floss).  Though not directly in the way, and quite interesting, I would have preferred these not to be in the middle of the story.  There is also a glossary, a \\"read more\\" section, Internet sites and an index.  Overall a good book (and series) and useful for storytimes, classrooms and solo reading.	2005-05-11

This is a charming story told in rhyme about a little girl (Belle) who's parents are too busy for her, but her caregiver (Bea) always has time for her, despite the numerous chores around the house.  Each day of the week is given two full page spreads--the first layout is devoted to describing verbally what that day holds, and how Belle makes Bea's day a little brighter, just by being a little girl.  The second layout is always a sweeping view of the beach, ocean or house, and how Belle and Bea are enjoying their playtime there.  The story ends rather abruptly, but readers are left thinking about that special adult they had in their life when they were children.  The illustrations are colorful and detailed (I love Belle dancing with a broom), and readers will sense all the emotions the words are conveying in the drawings.  A book that should appeal to the adult reading it as much as the child.	2004-08-10

Mrs. Seahorse lays the eggs in Mr. Seahorse's pouch and then he has the job of taking care of those eggs until they hatch.  As he waits, he meets several other father fish who are in charge of their eggs or babies.  In the end, the babies successfully leave Mr. Seahorse and his life goes back to \\"normal.\\"  This is a beautiful book--in typical Eric Carle style--with amazing artwork and soft colors befitting the ocean.  The storyline, however, leaves much to be desired.  It's a unique idea, as this book tackles various creatures of the sea that usually don't get specific mention in picture books, but the method falls short of it's potential.  The ending is quite abrupt, and readers will feel something is missing.  Overall I was disappointed with this book.	2004-06-02

Mostly we follow a quarter as it gets minted, sent to a bank, then travels throughout a city (from a grocery store to a parking meter to a garden center) and finally back to the bank.  Math is included throughout the book, and readers will be able to figure out page numbers by the amount of money shown on the bottom of the page (e.g. page 25 is a quarter).  The text is minimal, though there are several thought bubbles that keep the story moving.  The illustrations are clear and colorful; the artist used photographs of money, which makes it stand out.  A note is included in the back that gives more information about the history of money and specifically money in the United States.  A glossary is also included.	2004-05-11

Winner of a Coretta Scott King Honor Award<br />Jericho's school has a great club that all boys long to be a part of: The Warriors of Distinction.  It's been around for years (Jericho's uncle was even a part of it), and it's known for it's good deeds and the closeness of the members.  Every year new members are inducted into the group, and this year Jericho has been invited to join.  Before they can be called Warriors, though, they must go through an initiation process, which lasts a week.  At first the tasks seem harmless and only a little demeaning, but as the week progresses, the things the initiates (called Pledge Slime) are asked to do border on hazing.  Jericho struggles with staying in the group--if he drops out, then all the initiates suffer.  He also would lose the girl he loves, and any confidence the group would provide for him.  But he does wonder about lowering himself for this, and he also has a conflict with a musical contest--should he continue with the initiation or go to the contest, where he could win a full scholarship to Julliard?<br />This book is gripping, and the reader finds himself/herself caught up in all the action, wondering where the plot will go.  Draper skillfully takes twists and turns, carefully developing the tension to keep interest high.  Her characters are likeable, and readers will sympathize with Jericho.  I also liked that though the main characters in the story are African American, you weren't blinded by their race--it could have been anyone wanting to join the Warriors.  And the topic of school clubs and hazing is a good angle for a novel--pair this with The Chocolate War.<br />Where this book fell flat for me was in dialogue and underdeveloped plot threads.  Draper wasn't consistent with her dialects and slang, and much of the language felt forced out of the characters.  A major plot line that I felt got shoved under the carpet was Jericho's trumpet playing--it was a very big deal at the beginning of the book, but I didn't feel the tension by the end, when he needed to make the decision about continuing with the Warriors or going to the contest.  Another plot line that felt stunted and stereotypical was Kofi's (another Pledge Slime) home life.  Here is the typical teen character who's parents don't care, but Kofi felt a little forced on the issue, and that whole situation worked out a little too neatly in the end.<br />Overall it's a fast read (because you really want to know what happens), and a good topic, but it's not the best written book I've encountered.	2004-04-28

Both are typical representations of the creatures they portray, but they also have their own personalities.  The book is divided into several short stories, with Peanutbutter and Jeremy introducing each one.

A quick history about plumbing, bathing, and attitudes towards  cleanliness!  Lauber takes us on a jaunt through history starting with the cave man and his ideas about bathing.  She then jumps to the ancient Middle East, and then moves on to Greece and Rome.  Then she covers the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.  Lauber then moves to the United States, and the rest of the book focuses on modern bathing.  The book is illustrated by John Manders (who does an excellent job adding bits of humor in his drawings), and does not include any photographs of ancient ruins or artifacts or the like.  But there is still plenty of information--did you know that ancient Romans used a sponge on the end of a stick instead of toilet paper?  The stick was rinsed in salty water after they used it.  And that a flush toilet was invented in 1594?  This is a  readable nonfiction book that makes learning about the history of cleanliness fun.	2003-04-07

Ingold tells the reader that if you talk with anyone in Idaho or Montana for long enough, the subject of the Big Burn will come up, and the person telling you about it will expect you to know all about it.  After reading Ingold's well-researched book, any reader would be able to contribute to the subject.  Set in 1910, when forest rangers were new, railroads were huge, and immigrants were still flooding the country, The Big Burn tells the story of the wild fires of the northwestern United States.  Ingold gives us three main characters: Jarrett, Lisbeth and Seth.  These teenagers each deal with the fire in their own way, and find that there is more to fighting fires than a little water or ditch digging.  The three do meet in the tale (it is plausible), and each tell their view of the events in concurrent chapters.  Ingold breaks in with facts and accounts of actual events, which makes the fictitious story feel all the more real.<br />Ingold has done her homework, and it shows in the story.  Her afterword, acknowledgements, and list of suggested reading at the end all provide valuable information.  The only problem I had with the book was a bit of charaterization--the relationships between the characters felt forced and unbelievable, particularly the budding romance between Jarrett and Lisbeth.  On their own, the characters were strong, interesting, and contributed to the story.  But when they came in contact with the others, even the minor characters became a bit forced in the relationships in which they were observing or participating.  Otherwise this is a wonderful example of great historical fiction.	2003-03-24

Benno and his father own a bear, and that bear is what provides their meals, rent money and, most importantly, friendship for Benno.  The bear isn't the only method of income, though, as Benno's father has taught Benno how to be the best pickpocket in central Europe (called \\"the work\\" in the story).  Even though Benno has certain talent, he does get caught one day, is separated from his father and his bear, and finds there is a lot more to life than what he's known.  Benno never gives up on getting his bear back, and eventually everything works out for the best.<br />I found the beginning of the book a bit confusing--Zucker jumps around a bit before we find out what has happened.  Benno's character is likeable, but I never felt connected with him, and so I didn't feel the pain of separation from his bear, and I didn't sense his loyalty to his father, even when he decided to stay with him at the end.  The plot is original, and Zucker has painted an interesting world.  I would consider this an additional purchase.	2003-03-21

Crispin has lived his 13 years under Lord Furnival, and has known nothing but poverty, farming, and the name \\"Asta's Son.\\"  Crispin's life becomes complicated  when his mother dies, and only then does Crispin begin to find out more about himself, his father, and the world around him.  He also discovers he's a quick learner--a man nicknamed \\"Bear\\" teaches him how to juggle and play the recorder.  Crispin also finds he's wanted for theft and murder, two things he did not commit.  As time passes, Crispin learns the truth behind the accusations, and realizes his entire world will be more than just turned upside down.  <br />Avi has woven an incredibly detailed tale.  The reader will feel s/he is right there with Crispin because of all the \\"extras\\" Avi included--from food to clothing to worship styles to the layouts of the cities (muck and stench included).  Readers will sympathize with Crispin, and will even find themselves reprimanding him when he sneaks out.  The shifts in his character were a little disturbing (between curiosity and apathy), but overall Crispin is a full character.<br />This book is perfect for those who love Karen Cushman (The Midwife's Apprentice), or for those who aren't quite ready for Michael Cadnum (Book of the Lion).  It also complements A Door in the Wall (Henry) and The Trumpeter of Krakow (Kelly).	2003-03-06

Thousands mourn the drive by shooting of the famous Hispanic singer, including Alma.  Alma's whole world has collapsed, and she doesn't know how to cope.  She listens to her Jovita tapes over and over, until her brother takes her tape player away from her.  Furious, Alma finds another way to listen to music--her next door neighbor's house.  Climbing in through the cat flap, Alma uses the house as her refuge when things at home get too tense.  She never intended to harm anything, and never expected to get caught.  But her brother discovers her secret, and ruins everything.<br />Inspired by the death of Selena, Griffin has created a wonderful glimpse into the Hispanic world of San Antonio, Texas.  Readers enjoy the food, the language, the music, and the lifestyles of the culture.  The story itself felt a little disjointed, and character development was not complete--there were too many characters to deal with on a personal level.  Not only do we deal with Alma, but also the five people in her immediate family, the neighbor, friends, and extended family.  The ending was convienient, though it works for the story.  Overall, I enjoyed the cultural aspects of the book, and I like the idea of the storyline.	2003-02-24

He doesn't seem to be a farm kid--his mother always acted as a buffer between he and his father--but the  chores, the cows, and the routines have become a comfort zone for Ian.  When his father decides to sell their cows, Ian is surprised at how much he is against it.  But ever since the ice storm broke power lines, stray voltage has plagued their farm, and the cows are sick because of the extra electricity.  The farm is also suffering because Ian's mother has left.  Suddenly there is one less person to help with chores or keep things clean in the house.  Ian struggles with missing his mother, and finding his place on the farm without her.  School saves Ian, and his teacher often provides the comfort he needs.<br />The emotions in this book are real and powerful--the reader is drawn into Ian's world, and can't help feeling the same things Ian is feeling.  Ian's character also feasibly develops through the course of the book, and we see him change from event to event.  Other characters do not suffer development at Ian's expense, though.  Doyle creates each person with the same care as she does Ian.  Farm kids--old and young--will be able to identify with many things in this book.  Reader should know that there is undisguised swearing in the book, but it fits the scenes and characters and discussion.  Overall, this book didn't disappoint me!	2003-02-04

Meet Elizabeth Coleman--the first African American woman to fly a plane.  Coleman's story is told in a series of \\"interviews\\" starting from her childhood right up to her death.  Her family talks about her education, her determination, and her unfailing dream to be more than just a field hand.  Reporters talk about her as a pilot, and friends and fans talk about her courage and determination.  In a time when skin color was a huge dividing line, Coleman managed to rise above it all, literally, in a plane.  Her story is fascinating, and the style Nikki Grimes uses is readable, unique, and fitting for the tale.  E.B. Lewis's pictures capture various aspects of Coleman's life--including details that the words opposite the picture don't mention.  There is a note at the beginning of the book, and a note at the end, explaining more about Bessie Coleman and her life in the early 1900s.  There also is a bibliography provided.

She's only 11, but she has the gift to draw magnificent works of art. What Hollis doesn't have is a family--she was left on a corner when she was just a baby, and now she bounces from home to home, unable to stay for a long period of time. Once she realizes she's had enough of one foster family, or woman, she packs up her things and runs away for a few days. This pattern continues until she goes to stay with the Reagan family one summer. Suddenly she finds the family she's always dreamed about, and they are excited to adopt her. But Hollis can't quite accept that they truly want her, especially after she causes an accident, so she runs away again.<br />Giff has created a marvelous book of characters--the social worker, for example, that keeps placing Hollis is a despicable character. You feel it from the start when she spills mustard on herself, though I didn't realize you're supposed to think of her this way until half way through the book, when she spills coffee on herself. Hollis grows a bit through the book, enough to be realistic. The Reagan family is a good family, but not without their struggles. The format is not anything new--the current story is peppered with flashbacks, but it works for this tale. The story itself is plausible, even heartwarming (I was pleased to see a happy ending), and I believe it is the characterization that pushed it up to win a Newbery Honor.	2003-01-29

This Canadian historical fiction is about the training camps for the RAF and the RCAF during World War II.  Stephen is a young fighter pilot in training (part of the RAF).  Ellen is a girl living in the town near the training camp.  They become friends when Stephen returns Ellen's younger brother to her (he had been snooping around the base), and over the months they realize they love each other.  Stephen eventually has to go back to England to fight, but they continue to write.  Some of the plot is forced through the letters written home or to Ellen, and the characterization is a bit weak.  But you can still connect with Stephen, Ellen, her friends, his friends, and their families.  In some ways this was a typical war love story--it felt like an oral history as well.

So not only does she have to deal with her changing body, changing friendships, and changing school work load, she also has to live with uncontrollable tics and movements.  Everyone in her immediate class knows what Carrie has, but she worries what others will think when they see her.  This comes to a head during play practice one day--Carrie can't control herself, and begins to clear her throat and crack her shoulder over and over.  Ms. Anderson, the school counselor and play director, gives a little lesson on Tourette, and the cast seem to be enlightened, and Carrie is grateful.  <br />The kids in this book are all middle schoolers, but they felt like high schoolers, partly in what they dealt with, their actions, and their maturity.  But you were still sympathetic towards them.  I loved the fact that the kids (especially Carrie) thought Ms. Anderson was cool (as well as helpful).  Too often adults are trying to hard (according to the kids) or are bumbling.  I also enjoyed watching the friendships change and develop in the book--it made it more well rounded.

Kirk is not your average public high school student--he's short, smart, and prefers books to sports. He does what he can to make himself fit in (sort of)--he doesn't apply himself or do his school work, and is able to give quick come-backs. He's been a loner for most of his life. <br />This is another story where readers are thrust behind the scenes of a \\"misfit.\\"  We see how Kirk is bullied by the burnouts (and I would guess others as well), thus he doesn't do his homework or write his essays properly so as to hide his brains.  We discover that part of Kirk's problem is that his mother is an alcoholic, and has decided to move to California with her boss, wanting Kirk to join them so they can be a family (Kirk's father left when he was a baby).  Kirk is against this and refuses to leave his hometown.  <br />He refuses to leave because things in his life begin to look up--he is befriended by one of the burnouts, gets a girlfriend, and starts a new job reading to a blind woman that pays more money than the library job he had.  He also dislikes the man his mother ends up marrying.  I enjoyed this book--the characters are real (especially Kirk--we see his growth as he branches out), there are a lot of literary references (which was fun), and it was a fast read (kept me interested).  The kids do swear (strongly) in the book.  Kirk and his girlfriend have sex.  There is violence.  But none of it is gratuitous, and Moore isn't striving to be offensive with his writing.  Overall, I recommend the book to high schoolers and adults.	2002-12-16

Hattie lives in a typical small town in the 1950s and 60s United States--everyone knows all the gossip by sundown.  And when Hattie's unknown Uncle Adam comes to stay for a while, the news spreads quickly, as usual.  Adam is different--they aren't sure what is wrong with him, other than he has a mental disability.  Hattie finds she really likes her young uncle (he's 21, she's 12), and wishes she could help him more.  Ann M. Martin has created a realistic world in this book.  Throughout, Hattie goes through a range of emotions when dealing with her family.  The reader is able to understand where Hattie is coming from, and why she acts and reacts the way she does.  Martin also captures history in this book--from the carnival, to the grandparents' idea of what is proper, to the everyday activities of Hattie's life--without making the reader feeling disconnected.  Martin also manages to convey that families should talk about issues, instead of ignoring them, without sounding preachy.  Overall, this book will move you, if you let it.	2002-12-03

An excellent first time book for young adult author Gail Giles--she jumps into the psyches of high school boys (and girls) as she weaves an intense tale of power, betrayal, and teenage life.  Young Steward narrates the story, telling how Rob Haynes decides to take Simon Glass (the class geek) and make him popular.  Rob's plan works, but Simon has plans of his own.  Because of this Rob snaps, and Glass ends up dying.   Each chapter opens with a statement from one of the characters, giving hints of what happened after that year in high school.  This increases tension in the story, and gives the reader a sense of completion when the book does end (which it does abruptly).  The characters are a *little* flat and unsatisfactory, but the storyline prevents us from getting too close to the boys.  There isn't time to delve deep into each boy, as the purpose of this book is to tell one piece of life for several boys.  All in all, I would give this book to high schoolers (and older) for a quick, gripping read.<BR>Note:  this book does have some language, implied sex, murder, and is rather disturbing in general	2002-10-10

If you're like me, you only have a basic knowledge of the Amish life.  This book can help you gain a bit more insight and understanding of what it takes to be Amish.  Various aspects of life are addressed:  religion (which includes their history and worship), schooling, home life, and social life. It also discusses misconceptions, and how that even within the Amish there are variations from sect to sect.  There are clearly labeled photographs, maps and sidebars of information.  A full index, list of notes, works cited, and a 'for further reading' section is at the back.  The one problem I had with the book was it seemed to jump all over the place, and didn't flow as I was reading.  Some of it was logical, but other times it felt like the author didn't know where else to stick it, so she just added it to \\"leaner\\" chapters.  This series does provide good information, though, and students would be able to access what they needed through the index.	2002-07-05

This book is very similar to her first one, Caps for Sale, though this one has a stronger storyline.  The peddler is back selling his caps-carrying them all on his head, as usual.  But no one is buying-they're all at the county fair.  At this fair there is a circus, which has an elephant who likes to take caps.  He snatches all of the peddler's hats off his head and spreads them throughout the circus!  The peddler has to find a new trick to get all his caps back. This book would be great for a circus storytime, as there a parade and a show feature prominently in the story.	2002-07-05

Kerr took an interesting approach to the war by looking at Quakers and those with religions that oppose war and fighting.  This was a thought provoking novel, but Kerr tried too hard--she tackles too many issues at once, and the characters lose their believability.  For example, Jubal, the main character, is too young for the draft, so he spends his time wrestling with remaining a pacifist or joining as a non-combatant when he's old enough.  But Jubal's feelings are never apparent (you could chalk this up to he's confused himself, so the readers should be too), and he rarely lets the reader know his inner thoughts--he's too busy narrating.  He also has a little fling with a girl in town that just fell short of reality.  This novel could, however, be a springboard to studying other issues, such as Quakers and war or insane assylums during the 1940s.  Overall it was a disappointment--Kerr should have expanded or shortened her story to keep her characters developed.	2001-12-17

She lives in New York City with her Gran, until her Gran dies of heart failure.  Now Liv must move to California to live with her estranged father.  Her dad is a diver, and eventually brings Liv out on the boat with him to be his tender.  Though they struggle with each other on land, out at sea both are comfortable--a surprise to Liv.  She begins to learn a lot about her dad, herself, and life.  Written entirely in the third person, it occassionally is confusing, but the fast-paced action keeps you moving.  Characters fall out of believability at times, but generally are real enough for you to identify with them.  Readers will transform right along with Liv as she adjusts to a new life in California with her dad.	2001-11-19

Wendelin Van Draanen (writer of the Sammy Keyes series) has captured the thoughts of two neighbors--Bryce and Juli--as they face different aspects of life.  This light, sometimes humorous novel has alternating chapters for the main characters on a variety of subjects, from Bryce moving in across the street to Juli's tree to school assignments.  Both Bryce and Juli reach milestones of change in their lives, but I would not consider this a coming-of-age story, rather it is a gradual maturity as two kids grow into adolesence.  Van Draanen only strays from her format (Bryce's point of view and then Juli's point of view) a little, keeping the reader from confusion.  Anyone wondering about a boy's inner thoughts or girl's ponderings should read this book to get a glimpse inside!	2001-11-02

He is a horror writer in the sense that he faces true-to-life things like censorship, teen drinking, popularity, suicide and rape head on.  This particular book is about rape, and the frustration of being the victim.  I was a little shocked at the premise of the book, as all of the descriptions I read (e.g. the back cover of the book) did not hint that this was a serious horror book.  But Peck is very good at getting into the mindset of teenages and high school life, even those of 25 years ago.  One can hope that situations have improved since he first wrote this book.  Also, as I read I was able to fully immerse myself into the character of Gail--I felt her fear, her rage, the unreality of the whole situation, and then her resolution to keep going in the end.  This book *is* for older readers--I would give it to high schoolers or older.  When needing a book that deals with a serious social issue, Peck is a good bet.	2001-10-18

Reminiscent of Lester, the pig in the Mrs. Piggle Wiggle series, Lollipop is a homely pig chosen as a present by the spoiled Princess Penelope for her 8th birthday.  Her owner, Johnny, has trained this pig to obey commands much as a dog would, and comes to live at the palace with the pig.  The King secretly engages the boy to train his daughter as well, as she is getting out of hand.  This predictable story teaches a couple of lessons to the readers--the problem of selfishness and not judging by appearances--without beating the reader with those messages.  The illustrations complement the text, which is roughly a 3rd grade level.	2001-10-18

A young boy is approached by a tiger (the gang), and is asked to hop on (join the gang).  Once he's riding, the boy is excited and can't believe the tiger has such an interest in HIM, a 10 year old.  Then he learns the darker side of being on the tiger, and wants to get off.  The tiger does not make it easy, but in the end, the tiger loses a potential member.  The bold, striking woodcuts accentuate the text, and deftly portray the scenes the text describes.  This book opens up many avenues for discussion with parents, teachers, and (older) children, especially children who are not exposed to gangs on a regular basis.	2001-07-31

I would share this book with preschoolers--either to rememeber their babyhood, or if they have a new baby in the house. The text is simple, and could apply to a preschooler's life as well. The illustrations are tastefully done, with much detail, and use a variety of colors and layouts (some are full page, others have more white space). The babies and families portrayed are quite diverse, and are drawn doing different activities within each \\"every day, everywhere, babies are...\\" that occupies the page. Overall, I recommend this book to anyone who loves to see babies in all aspects of life!	2001-07-31

For one thing, the main character had a good home life.  Debbie was not dealing with drugs, abusive parents, divorce or any of the other calamaties that can happen in life.  For another, Debbie's emotions seemed real--not forced or contrived.  She was allowed to dislike the other girl in the triangle.  I did find the writing to be a bit overly descriptive (though her descriptions were fun), and because we were listening, the chapter breaks were a little disconcerting.  But Hope Davis did a marvelous job reading, and anyone looking for realistic teen fiction, try this one!	2001-06-01

This Christian fantasy fiction series is a great read for school age kids.  The series shows some of the hard truths of being a Christian, and the ups and downs of the Christian life.  In general, the characters do not develop throughout the series in a satisfying way (though some do) and each book wraps up a little too neatly for the real life Bibee is trying to portray.  There always is a bit of a cliffhanger at the end of the book, a classic use of suspense to keep a reader going through the series.  Overall, I recommend the series, especially to those with reluctant readers!	2001-04-27

I was excited to see that Frank Peretti was writing a series for young adults, as I have read both the Cooper family adventures and some of his adult novels.  This novel is high on suspense (bordering on horror in some spots), and full of truth.  His characters were a little weak, and the story progressed a little too convienently, but it is a series, so he has time to flesh out the Springfields and their Veritas project.  This was a quick read, and I thought a nice blend of the suspense of the adult books, yet not too unnerving, and the close-knit family of the kids' books.	2001-03-05

There was adventure and romance, I'll admit.  Peyton kept me reading, as I wanted to know the outcome of the novel.  <br />However, that was the only thing that kept me going.  The characters were rather flat and convienient.  Ben, for example, showed up when a big brother character was needed, but disappeared when he wasn't.  <br />Another difficulty I have with the book is Part One is told from Charlotte's (the main character) point of view, and Part Two is from a character outside of the group.  This device can be engaging, and can cause the reader to consider multiple points of view.  In Snowfall, however, it falls flat and is not satisfactory.	2000-11-28

Her descriptions of India, the people, the customs, and lifestyles transported me back in time.  She shows the true nature of a  &quot;third world country&quot; by throwing in tidbits of the present world  also--jeeps and gas stoves--to remind us that though this seems to be a  historical novel, the villagers are living in our time.   I was  disappointed with character development, though by the end of the book.   She tried to wrap things up a little too neatly, and then leaves the reader  hanging anyway.  The true friendship Parvati finally encounters is strained  and almost forced.  The reader wonders which is stronger:  the new friend,  the need to dance, or cultural taboos?   Overall I really enjoyed this  book, and for anyone who has visited India and misses it, this would be a  good book to read.	2000-06-26
