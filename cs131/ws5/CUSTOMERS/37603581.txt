I have heard that millions of people use Amazon and I have to wonder what percentage of those million fall somewhere on the technology spectrum between computer lover and baby hacker (like I do). I'd guess over half if not as much as three quarters. Being that's the case, I have some good news - we finally have a hero to root for and relate too. Instead of yet another detective, doctor or lawyer solving the puzzles and saving the day, John Sandford's \\"Kidd\\" novels highlight the talents of a computer extraordinaire.  <br /> <br />Even better news is the fact that this novel is not the first to feature the great Kidd and his hacking skills. This novel is the 4th in the series and I strongly recommend going back and starting with \\"The Fool's Run\\" so that you can be properly introduced to Kidd as well as his amazing partner in crime, LuEllen, and the mysterious Bobby. If you have read the others, then prepare yourself for another fine installment in the series. I hate to break it to you, but Bobby is murdered in the first three pages and the rest of the book pivots around Kidd's desperate search to locate Bobby's laptop (full of the world's secrets naturally) and the killer. LuEllen is also involved and fleshed out even more, which is a plus. A very good read from a very good author. <br />	2004-11-29

Roberts is a great standby for these sorts of trips because her books are predictably entertaining and fun. Unfortunately, \\"Birthright\\" gave me trouble. Don't get me wrong; the story itself was of the usual Roberts high caliber if not even a little better than some. The problem stemmed from the reader of the audio version. Sometimes I've found that readers try just a little too hard and in this book, it showed.  <br /> <br />I appreciate the reader trying to differentiate between the characters by using slightly modified voices, but in this recording, it was incredibly overdone to the point of distraction. There got to be times when I would grimace when a certain character or another came back into the plot because the faked dialect was so irritating.  <br /> <br />If I had it to do over, I'd save this book to curl up with on the couch on a rainy day and choose another to listen to for 14 hours in the car. You may want to consider doing the same. <br />	2004-11-29
US	37603581	R22G6L727K3XEF	0380726297	516722500	Sacred	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Very much enjoyed it. Here's what you need to know.	First, this is the 3rd book in the series. If you're like me and prefer to read a series in the order that it was written (and hence evolve with the characters), you'll want to get this book along with the other two that precede it (Drink Before the War & Darkness, Take My Hand). Also, Lehane does talk some about the plots that took place in the two previous books and those references will be lost on you if you start with book 3. With that said, I thought the book was very good. Like his others, it was filled with great writing, was very visually descriptive and nicely put together. Lehane's strong suite is his excellent characters. They are complex, believable and interesting. I can see why Mr. Lehane uses some of them again and again in his novels (a male and female pair of Private Detectives). The book is written in the first person primarily, which I normally don't care for but works well here because it's not overdone (thus giving the reader many perspectives). Unlike his first two books, the villains and situations are not quite as intense so I was a shade disappointed there. He makes up the slack though in the plot with this one as it is even more of a twisty-turn mystery than the others. Overall, if you enjoy authors like Patricia Cornwell or Thomas Harris or Phillip Margolin, then I recommend you try this novel. You won't be disappointed.	2004-08-19

Here's what you need to know.	First, it's short. Very short. Took me approximately 45 minutes to read it cover to cover because, even though the book is listed as having 94 pages, the font they use it huge. So, if you're a fan of quick to read books, this is a plus. If you consider the book costs 20 bucks new, not a great bargain (however there are hundreds of used copies around). The book has three main sections (no counting author forwards, etc.): An intro where the stage is set to tell the story within the story (a group of adults at their high school reunion), the Cheese Story itself, and a follow-up that explains some points in the story (again with the group of adults). In my opinion, the intro and the follow-up are wasted space and should have been left out because the Cheese Story of the book could easily have stood on its own. The Cheese Story is basically a proverb about dealing with life's changes. It contains many clear and important messages such anticipating change and facing your fears. For anyone who is unhappy with their current lot in life or is facing major changes at work or at home (such as layoffs or divorce), this simple story can be very helpful.	2004-08-19

Laura Ingalls Wilder is a wonderful writer. It was her intention that the series end in the nice, neat little wrap-up she included in \\"These Happen Golden Years.\\" However, this novel, \\"The First Four Years,\\" was published after both Laura and her daughter Rose had died. And after reading the text, I can see why these pages were not really written to be published. Foremost, the book is too sad. None of the cheerful quips and passages that fill the other Little House books are included in this one. It is only a detailed account of all the incredible hardships the young couple faces. Second, the book contradicts parts of the other novels (in fact it starts with the same marriage proposal scene captured so sweetly in \\"Golden Years\\" only in this version, Laura initially says no because Almanzo is a farmer and she can't stand the idea of being a farmer's wife!) These are things to keep in mind before getting this book. Admittedly, it is interesting to know what happens next to Laura, but this book is not like the others. Be prepared.	2004-07-13

In the back of the book, Stephen Hunter acknowledges that A) he was struggling to write this next novel and B) the idea to send Earl to Havana was not his idea. Personally, I believe this shows through in places. At times it almost seemed that Earl didn't fit in with the plot, was kind of made to fit even. Yes, the gunfights and such persist. We even see Earl in the role of \\"sniper\\" (see Hunter's incredible book \\"Point of Impact\\" for a great sniper novel) but it's not enough to win over a tried and true Stephen Hunter fan. Hunter has done better. The good points though are the return of Frenchy Short, a great character from the first Earl novel, \\"Hot Springs.\\" The setting for pre-Castro Cuba and the interesting historical twist of including Fidel as a key character are also well done. Unfortunately, Hunter seems to get too caught up with these other characters and misses the fact that it's our hero Earl that we've come to hear about.	2004-06-02

With so many distinct characters running around and so many plot lines whipping every which way, the story just gets too thin in places to be a good read. With me, it's always hit or miss with Koontz. Some of his work is my absolute favorite reading material (\\"Watchers\\" especially) and other times I come across something like this. If only it had just been about the special boy, or the crippled girl, or the Private Eye, or the psycho Phd... but unfortunately, Koontz crams them all in and thus takes a bunch of good stories and creates a crummy one.	2004-06-02

All the Ayn Rand fans are going to ding me for this, but I have to be honest - this novel didn't survive my \\"100 page rule\\" (translation: if you're not hooked by page 101, don't bother finishing the book, there are too many other novels to consider instead). Believe me, I wanted to read and love this book. I've heard nothing but rave reviews about Rand and picked this novel up with much anticipation. But the novel is over 1000 pages and after cracking 10%, I knew there was no way I was going to force myself to plow through it to the end. If you're like me and thinking to buy this because so many others have told you about it, please consider - this book is categorized as fiction but it reads too much like a textbook to just kick back and enjoy. The characters (at least as far as I got) are very one dimensional. Perhaps they get better and I missed out. I admit this \\"classic\\" did have an interesting plot and I'm sure it has many fine points & hidden meanings if the reader is into such topics. The tone of this novel was much like some L. Ron Hubbard fiction I've read.	2004-02-10

First, I thought the book was excellent. Great writing, very visually descriptive and nicely put together. Excellent characters that are complex and believable and interesting. I can see why Mr. Lehane uses them again and again in his future novels (a male and female pair of Private Detectives). The book is written in the first person primarily, which I normally don't care for but works well here because it's not overdone (thus giving the reader many perspectives). The villains and situations are very dark (as the title suggests) and I would compare Mr. Lehane's &quot;monsters&quot; to the likes of Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lector although the descriptions of the acts done on others are not quite as graphic (which can be a plus, if you're reading while eating lunch for example). The plot is a clever mystery and realistic on all levels especially regarding the main character's (Patrick) relationships with the other characters in the novel. If you enjoy authors like Patricia Cornwell or Thomas Harris or Phillip Margolin, then I recommend you try this novel. You won't be disappointed.	2004-01-27

Patterson writes in the front pages of this novel that his book &quot;Where the Wind Blows&quot; is his most popular book overall. That doesn't surprise me as it is certainly one of my favorites. &quot;The Lake House&quot; is a sequel to that best seller and picks up pretty much right where the other book left off. Unfortunately. Rather than take us on a new journey with familiar characters we like (Kit, Fran, Max and the gang), Patterson rehashes the same plot (mysterious lab doing bad things to people in the name of science) and sadly, doesn't even do that very well. I was very disappointed in this book and would not recommend anyone who is a Patterson fan read it. You will be left wondering, as I was, why did this even get published? One word answer for that one I'm afraid - money. Not Patterson best effort.	2004-01-21

The North and South series are some of the very best novels I've read. I was very disappointed in On Secret Service and could not get past page 100.

I did not particularly like this one. Primarily because the main character, a public defender turned tort lawyer, is greedy, shallow, and ridiculously naive. Unlike other Grisham novels where the hero is trying to fight society's wrongs (or at least the Firm's), this book's plot is about screwing the little people (even ruining an entire small town) to make millions and buy jets. I found the whole concept rather disgusting and the hero got off way too easy in the end.	2004-01-12

If you are one of those two types, here is my short advice:<br />Don't buy this book.<br />If you're new to Stephen King, then you will be happier in the long run if you start with many of King's earlier works (like 'Salem's Lot or The Stand). In this novel, Wolves of Calla, he references many of his other books and characters and settings. These references will either be lost on you or confuse you and will take away from the level of enjoyment this book offers.<br />If you're getting it as a gift, be aware this novel is book 5 of a long and complicated series. Reading this book as a stand alone novel would not be pleasant or appreciated. Make sure whoever you are buying for has read the other Dark Tower novels and enjoyed them. Not all Stephen King fans have liked this series because it does differ from his normal &quot;scare me silly&quot; style.<br />Hope that helps.	2004-01-08

I already know that some of you are going to be upset that I gave this critically acclaimed, award nominated book such a low score. WAIT before you get mad and let me explain. I listened to the book on tape. The audio version. Some 36 hours. But it's not the length of the book that's a problem - longer is usually better actually. It's the intense imagery that was problem. McEwan spent so many words describing the intimate details of everything in this novel. I literally drowned in the descriptions sometimes. If I had been reading the novel, I am sure I would have \\"skimmed\\" places (yes, we all do it, but only some of us can admit it) and hence felt the full impact of the wonderful plot. The three points of narration are masterful. The characters are incredible. If I had read this book. I'd probably have scored it a five. But I didn't. And on audio, even though it is very well read by Jill Tanner, it was too much of a good thing.

Also, the book jacket I read made it sound like this was the return of the main characters (Kidd and LuEllen) but it is not. This is the book where they first work together. With all that said, this book is good but not as good as some other Sandford novels I have enjoyed. I am a computer nerd of sorts myself, so I found the books plot (computer hacking/industrial warfare) interesting. The scenes centered around LuEllen's skills at B &amp; E are good too. The story includes some clever elements and plot twists that always make for a fun read. Overall, I liked the book and would recommend it as a precursor to reading the better novel, \\"Empress File.\\"	2003-02-21

His best book since \\"Time to Hunt.\\" Earl Swagger, the hero, is every bit as good as his son in the earlier written, later set novels. Pale Horse Coming is the second book starring Earl Swagger (Hot Springs was the first) but you can read this novel as a stand alone work. Hunter does a good job of explaining any references to the prior novel. The setting for this action thriller is Thebes, Mississippi in the late 1940s - a town run by anarchists working in a place second only to hell in torment and pain - the Thebes Correctional Facility (Colored). Earl goes to this Godforsaken place to save a friend but ends up getting caught in the processes. That's about the time things get ugly and interesting. A great read. Hunter just keeps getting better and better. Like all Hunter novels, very in-depth in tactical skills and weaponry from the time period.	2003-02-18

Parts of the novel, including the ending were too familiar for it to be fresh. Either that or this novel was too much like some of his other work, which is possible. My only complaint about Koontz is his tendency to be predictable. The heroes win and the evil is destroyed. In \\"Whispers\\", this is again the case. On the flipside, I love Koontz for his great characters and relationships between these characters. I feel more attached to Koontz's character then I do with other similar authors. In \\"Whispers\\", Koontz builds two great characters - Hillary the screenwriter, sweetheart and victim, Tony the cop and super nice guy.<br />The plot is clever and has some nice twists.  The protagonist is suitably evil and scary. This is not my favorite novel by Koontz (actually \\"Watchers\\" is my current favorite) but this is still a very good read.	2003-02-11

The book is written in the first person as a diary and read (I listened to the audio version) by the author. It centers as much around revealing the skeletons in the O'Hara and Butler closets as it does around being black in the period of America's Reconstruction. I actually wish that Randall had ignored the \\"Gone with the Wind\\" theme entirely and instead written a period piece. I feel the book's plot could easily have stood on its own without that added distraction. There was one element to the book that I wish had been toned down and that was the constant references to sex. Even though this is supposed to be a diary, the author uses sexual circumstance and metaphors to make her point far, far too often.	2003-01-31

Ender is not longer a boy, but a man who has travelled from world to world in search of a place to settle and allow the rebirth of the &quot;buggers&quot;. He ends up on a strange plant inhabited by the only other alien species known - the piggies.<br />This book is layer upon layer of social impacts based on culture, religion, family, love, science... very deep in places, very imaginative in its sci-fi appeal. An excellent reading/listening experience.	2003-01-23

After reading this novel, I had to ask myself \\"why was this ever even published?\\" I've enjoyed Cornwell novels immensely over the years and was horribly disappointed in this piece of rubbish. Set in Charlotte, NC and centering around the local police force trying to catch a serial killer, the characters are simply flat and as a whole evoke no emotional response from the reader. The plot is childishly simple and not specifically engaging. This is not a true effort from a highly talented writer. There are many much better Patricia Cornwell novels. Forget this one and go try something else.	2003-01-16

This book is a prequel to the novel Point of Impact which centered around Bobby Lee Swagger. Hot Springs instead focuses on Earl Swagger, Bobby Lees father. Earl Swagger has just returned from WWII where his valor in combat earned him the Medal of Honor. He returns to Arkansas where he grew up and tries to settle down with his young, beautiful and now pregnant wife and live a normal life. But the Swagger blood doesnt appear to be able to thrive unless it is in peril and before long, Swagger is working for an Arkansas D.A. to build a fighting unit to wipe out crime in the gangster controlled gambling town of Hot Springs.<br />Like all of the Swagger novels, this book is filled with great combat scenes and tactics as well as extensive details on firearms. Set in 1946, the novel also paints a very vivid portrait of vice and the power of gangsters to control a city or even a state. If you enjoyed the other Swagger (Bobby Lee) novels, this newest turn will not disappoint you. If you have never read a Stephen Hunter novel, welcome and get ready for a good old fashion good guys with guns versus bad guys with guns book you will enjoy.	2003-01-16

This is the second novel in the Song of Ice and Fire series and is every bit as good as the first. This is an excellent series - completely enjoyable and exciting. Do not attempt to read this book before reading book one \\"The Game of Thrones\\" as the author does not spend much time on existing character development or detailing in the second novel. Only new characters are fleshed out. Also, many plot points are carried over from the first book and hence, the novel will be very confusing if read alone and not in it's proper place in the series.	2003-01-15

After racing through almost a thousand pages, I can easily understand why this is the case. I was pleasantly surprised (being I disliked Follett's \\"The Third Twin\\") to find this book a very entertaining piece of historical fiction. Set in England in the civil war torn years between the reign of Henry I and Henry II, the book winds its way through the lives of a several very engaging main characters (especially the villains) while always bringing the reader back the book's primary theme - the building of a cathedral in Kingsbridge. Don't be fooled, even though the building of a cathedral may not sound like a great plot vehicle, Follett makes it work and work beautifully. Best of all, \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" has a little of everything. The novel is all at once a love story, a light history lesson, a view of religion and a taste of war (not to mention Follett throws in a lot of 12th century architectural trivia). Overall, it's an appealing tale of good versus evil and worth picking up off the shelf.	2003-01-03

The characters are simply bizarre and as a whole evoke no emotional response from the reader. The plot is childishly simple and, although at times humorous through folly, not specifically engaging. Barely 300 pages (and that's with careful formatting), it's obvious \\"Sin Killer\\" was churned out to simply make a deadline and is not a true effort from a highly talented writer. There are many much better Larry McMurty novels. Forget this one and go try something else.	2003-01-03

Although following the plot lines developed in the first three novels, King digresses for a large portion of the novel from the characters' present to Rolland's past. And it is a wonderful digression indeed. Finally we get to see a portion of what has made the Gunslinger such a cool and deadly ranger. Written as a western tale, the story within the story is a special treat. Never have I felt more emotion for the characters.<br />Of course, as the novel is deliciously long (700+ pages), there is plenty of story left for the other characters. Rolland and his colorful posse wander ever forward on their journey to reach the Dark Tower, even taking a short but interesting turn through a town straight out of \\"The Stand.\\" I do love the crossovers. And I am eagerly awaiting the next installment.	2003-01-03

Books of castles and dragons or spaceships and aliens usually don't entertain me (with their weak plots and single dimensional characters). So it is a rare treat indeed to find myself unable to put down a book filled with knights, castles and, yes, a few dragons. \\"Game of Thrones\\" is simply excellent reading. The first book in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series, this novel is much more than just another fantasy book. The plot is beautifully complex and developed to an amazing degree leaving the reader constantly hooked. The characters are multidimensional and leap to life off the page. But, be warned, this is no children's fairytale. If you like all things to end well, then this book will leave you frustrated. \\"Thrones\\" is fantasy story based on a medieval realism with the heroes and villains not always what they seem. I can not wait to move on to this novel's sequel. It is truly that good.	2003-01-02
