US	52933160	R21EBQGWIHVAKE	0399150897	362587713	Blow Fly	Books	3	5	6	N	Y	Far from her best effort	The last Scarpetta installment is a weird one. Use of third person in discribing events gets old too quickly and really does not do much for the plot. <BR>Speaking of the plot, the reintroduction of Benton was so flat and lifeless that you'd think he just came back from the short holiday! Also, the ending is pretty lame.<BR>Having said that, Patricia Cornwell is still one of the masters and I sincerely do hope that, after the awkwardness of trying to tie up so many lose ends in a jiffy, the next Scarpetta novel is on the level we all come to expect.	2003-10-16

This book is a definite MUST for your reading list and I strongly suggest preparation of nourishment beforehand, as you will not want to put it down before you've devoured each and every page.<br />Seemingly unconnected murders, Catholic boarding school, computer games, people with past, hacking and a surprising twist at the end (and no, you'll have to find out the hard way!).<br />I cannot wait for the next offering from P.J. Tracy!	2003-09-08

This is a charming book, perhaps not as informative as a biography, but it makes us feel as if we were there. I must admit that I skipped some pages where Mr. Berg explains his other exploits, impatiently wanting to see what happened with Kate, but this is a page turner nonetheless.	2003-08-04

On 'vacation' from hell, he gets involved into the mysterious happenings at the little town of Medicine Creek, somewhere in Kansas. You can expect many twists and turns as he investigates multiple murders that just keep on coming, never, of course, losing his cool.<BR>A definite must for all Lincoln Preston fans.	2003-08-04

Many things from Ryan's past explained - in painful detal, I might add. <br />It is, thought, a bit unnerving to read stories - plot-wise - backwards, but still, the book fills the missing bits.<br />Could've been 100-150 pages shorter, without major loss of plot.<br />Hopefully, NEXT Ryan novel will be spot on.	2003-04-08
US	52933160	R1EA252GNE30EP	0446525804	472682750	Last Man Standing	Books	5	1	4	N	Y	Another page turner	Web London is a tough guy - a member of the Hostage Rescue Team, the best of the best. And yet, going into a routine mission, he simply froze. And the rest of his team died in an ambush. He makes it his mission to find out what really happened. Throw in numberous obstacles, betrayals from unlikely sources, tough guys and gunpower...<br />An excellent page turner and a highly recommended book. (sorry, no plot details). By the way, my favourite (briefly appearing) character is Angie, a fellow HRT's wife, who scares the living daylights out of the best of them.	2002-09-18

As usual, the unstopable Marlen goes head first into something she really, really shouldn't have and finds herself, and her family, in a midst of a generations old feuds in a truly Wild West town, full of colourful characters.<br />Expectedly, things quickly turn for the worse and (unexpectedly) <BR>Karps do not come out of this mess unscathed (no, I won't go into details - read the book).<br />Maybe not the best in the series, but I am biting my nails for the next installment nevertheless.	2002-08-27

Feeling very much alive, she goes on a quest with our old friends, Judy and Mary (and Bennie) to find out who killed her? and, since she was very much alive, who was killed?<br />I admit, some of the plot schemes were a little light for the members of the bar association, but you can't hold that against the book. <br />Oh, and for those complaining that a completely new character was placed in the hot seat - Anne Murphy appeared, albeit briefly, in Vendetta Defense.	2002-07-18

Without fail is the latest installment of the Jack Reacher series, and I can honestly tell you that Lee Child keeps on getting better and better.<br />An unusual proposal (how would you like to assasinate a Vice President?) leads to a page turning thriller with intelligent and sometimes unexpected twists and turns.<br />You don't need the background from previous novels (L. Child neatly sums everything up in few sentences), but I can only recommend that you read 'em all up.<br />More, please!	2002-05-30

You'd think Alex McKnight learned his lesson about not sticking his nose where it does not fully belong... but no, he likes to revisit the lessons the hard way.<br />A fourth installment in Alex McKnight series and they keep on getting better. Steve Hamilton provides you with just the right amount of background information to gently lead you into the story - and I will not go into the story details, for obvious reasons.<br />Funny, fast paced, with some good twists and turns, North of Nowhere is another page turner. Don't skip it.	2002-05-29

So I found myself skipping pages to come to some new information.<br />On the other hand, mistakes aside, it is still a fascinating read, albeit a bit flawed one - why, all of a sudden, Ms Auel feels that she has to show that Ayla rolls her r's? This is a new and unwelcome development which only appears once in a while. I mean, either she does or she doesn't!<br />That said, I am keeping my fingers crossed that book 6 will answer all our questions and finally quench our thirst.	2002-05-13

(for obvious reasons I will not go into the plot)<br />Mo Hayder proves, once again, that reading her books before going to bed is definitely NOT clever. <br />A chillingly good thriller, with a plot that is, sadly, quite believable. Bits and pieces slowly fall into place and there are just enought twists and turns to keep you interested. Jack Cafferry is far from perfect, but his flaws make him what he is.<br />Yet again we are left to wonder-do monsters like this really exist? and hope that they are just figments of a brilliant imagination.<br />Read it.	2002-02-26

(although I am sure everyone knows by now what's happening in the book, I still won't go into detail, as it might spoil the fun!)<br />I have read and re-read all four books in different editions and languages and I am still not tired! <br />Realizing that there is light at the end of the tunnel (long wait for the fifth book), I started reading the whole series, yet again, to refresh my memory and be ready to dive into the Shelters of Stone.<br />The first installment is simply breathtakingly captivating. Although this was not my first reading, I was still very moved and lived Ayla's hopes and fears and struggle to be accepted by the Clan. <br />Fascinating details about the life and rituals of the Clan, their beliefs and values are told through this gripping pre-historic thriller. <br />The whole series is a definite must for every shelf. I can't sit still waiting for the Shelters of Stone!	2002-02-25

It looked like a perfect crime - a dead guy's account, unclaimed for three years was about to go over to the state. Oliver and Charlie Caruso, two brothers working at secretive and eclusive private bank in New York thought they could get away with it...<BR>But (and there was a big BUT coming) things go so wrong, so fast. <br />A fast paced thriller, humorous dialogue, surprising twists and turns... and Disneyland will never be the same again!<br />I cannot recommend it highly enough.	2002-02-06

I love the new Alex Cross book, so much so that I've finished it in one sitting! The sheer number of chapters - 116 - did not put me off at all, because the chapters are short and to the point, and you can feel the excitement - almost like watching the movie. <br />(I will not go into plot details, for obvious reasons!).<br />The only slightly negative comment I might have is that the scene where Alex finally figures out who Mastermind is (and we've known since Roses are Red) a bit lukewarm and an anticlimax.	2001-11-26

And it's not that easy to figure out what will happen next. <br />Although I do miss lincoln and Amelia, I wouldn't mind reading another one of these!	2001-05-15

OK, so maybe this is not a literary masterpiece, but it's a great read. Stone Barrington manages, yet again, to thoroughly complicate a simple (well, not so simple) I-met-this-girl-and-I-want-to-see-her-again-but-I-don't-know-her-name-or-address case and make an amusing mess out of it, implicating some of the characters from his previous cases.

Just as Alex Cross stories were beginning to sound a little bit strained, there comes Women's Murder Club! Four tough ladies, thorougly professional, solving cases on their own, outside official guidelines, but effectively.<br />The book is full of Paterson-twists, unespected bad guys popping out at the end and a wonderfully twisted end.<br />Maybe not Patterson's best, but among the best.	2001-04-05

The computer bunch enters into a suicide polar boat race (operative words: suicide and polar), with no crew except for a ton of expensive computer equipment. Murphy's law states that everything that can go wrong will go wrong - and it does. <br />Read it, it's fun	2001-03-14

I have to admit that I was a bit lost at one point, hoping that the UFO link was not going to be the explanation and, thank God! it wasn't. But it was an interesting detour.<br />If you want to read this one, read Ground Zero as well. They are both great thrillers and I can't wait for more.	2001-02-28

I was a bit surprised at the end (and I won't say what with, obviously), but it worked for me. Another one that's hard to put down. <br />I also enjoyed a short story that appeared on ...  which explains the background of cooperation between McCaleb and Bosch (but, even without it, you don't miss out anything).<br />Read this book.	2001-02-28

However, I read this one (mistakenly thinking it was just a plain ole Mystery/Thriller) and LOVED IT.<br />If this is ever made into a movie, I bet it gets an 18 certificate.<br />Great, witty dialogue (steamy scenes), coupla murders and a guy to die for...

I wanted to give up so many times - because it was BORING - but bravely soldiered on - because INTERESING bits and pieces kept on popping up. <br />Still, it's more a miss than a hit, and endless conversations between Dot and Keller reminded me of Waiting for Godot. Was there another point to their dialogue, except to drive everyone crazy? I don't know. <br />Can't say I recomend it fully, can't say I don't recomend if fully. Hence 3 stars.	2001-02-19

I mean, if you substitute Jack Ryan with John Kelly, add or substract a plot or two, it boils down to almost the same thing. Or it's me? I gave this book three stars - one for the effort, one for the lenght and one for the weight, as TC seems to be producing door-stoppers. Maybe he's paid by weight? Word count? He ain't getting paid for the plot, that's for sure.<br />I think TC should take a deep breath and think long and hard whether he wants to write another monster (Executive Orders, Rainbow Six, The Bear and the Dragon). I love books, I love to read, I can read almost anything and I don't mind reading good books twice, but boy, I'm really not sure I want to add another TC to my book collection.	2001-01-10

First of all, this book is HUGE and you need  a notepad handy at all times, in order to be able to follow the plot. I  agree that the book sounds like a family reunion, but what the heck  happened to Jack Ryan? From a believable and likable guy, he became a  foul-mouthed wimp! I am sure that POTUS does not need to use language like  that to get his message accross. As far as the ending goes, what happened?  It looks like TC ran out of paper/memory/patience and just stopped. Or he  decided to end our misery?<br />This is not even close to his previous books.  A thoroughly disappointing read, especially to all Jack Ryan fans, who  anxiously waited to see what happened next.	2000-09-14

You have to know a bit about Denmark to be able to understand the fascination with snow shown in this book - did you know that Danish has more than 20 different words with which to describe snow? <br /> I could not put the book down once I've started reading it and finished it in 5 hours. <br /> As I said, brilliant!	1997-12-11
