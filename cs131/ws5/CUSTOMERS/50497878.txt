If that is your biggest problem when it comes to buying a car, then you are either very rich or very stupid.  There are much better books around on how to deal with dealers, getting the most for your used car, not getting screwed on a lease, etc.  The only adivce this book had on bargaining with dealers was \\"if you're not comfortabe with what's going on in the dealership, walk out.\\"  Sorry, but there's a lot more to negotiating than that.	2002-02-15

This book is full of information and I feel so knowledgeable about my own cycle.  I am newly married and don't want to have children now and have never been pregnant.  I feel assured that I am ovulating successfully every  month, which is great because I've had some serious health problems.  Of  course, I don't know if I could carry a baby to term, but at least the  basics are working! <br />I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars only because  the way it the information is organzied.  She begins with lots and lots of  history and opinions and you're dying to get to the part about your cycle,  which doesn't come for a while.  She also mentions things in the beginning  without explaining what they are.  So, read it as many times as you need to  get it.  <br />If you have fertility problems I highly recommend &quot;The  Cure For All Diseases&quot; by Dr. Hulda Clark.  I was very ill and got  well from this book.  Dr. Clark has done some amazing research on  fertility.  A diseased and polluted body will not be able to pro-create.   If you follow her suggestions, you can get well.	2000-07-20

I spent years going to Overeaters Anonymous because I thought my food cravings were due to some deep and mysterious psyhcological problem! HA!<br />I am a T-type and was  eating in the worst possible way I could!  I did juice fasts.  I was a  vegetarian and suffering from chornic fatigue and made it through the day  only by over-stimulating my thyroid, which made everything worse!  There  was nothing I could do, it seemed, to lose weight.  <br />Now I eat for my  type.  I am astounded at how little I eat and how satisifed I feel.  I have  been losing weight effortlessly.  AMEN!<br />Also, I should add that I used  Dr. Clark's &quot;The Cure for All Diseases&quot; to get rid of my chronic  fatigue virus and my food allergies.  I do Dr. Abravnel's diet in  conjunction with Dr. Clark's program. (Her program is not a diet.) If you  are sick or just want to have more energy and vitality, you should  absolutely pick up Dr. Clark's book.  IT'S TRULY AMAZING.	2000-07-17

If your body is doing that, isn't  something wrong with your body?<br />For a great book on eliminating food  craving by eliminating the cause, read &quot;Dr. Abravanel's Body Type  Diet.&quot;  It will set you free.<br />If you aren't well, read Dr. Hulda  Clark's &quot;The Cure for All Diseases&quot;.  You will learn how to heal  yourself.  I overcame the chronic fatigue virus which I'd had for 8 years.   Not only that, I have more energy and vitality than most people I know.   <br />If you think, also, that you have deep psychological problems, read  &quot;Dianetics&quot; by L. Ron Hubbard.  I used to wonder what was wrong  with me that my life never got better in spite of years in therapy and my  earnest efforts.  I used to wonder why so many of the people in OA meetings  were the same insane people, unable to live fully, year after year. I read  Dianetics and laughed!  It was the missing link to why psychology doesn't  work.  My husband and I did Dianetics and I truly became saner, happier and  freer.	2000-07-17

The recipes are workable and good.<br />If you want to get rid of your food allergies entirely (as I have) pick up &quot;The Cure For All Diseases&quot; by Dr. Hulda Clark.  You can  buy it on Amazon also.  Read the section on &quot;Universal  Allergies&quot;.  Recipies for her treatments are in the back of the book.   It took me 9 liver flushes to eat wheat and dairy again.

By doing the programs in Dr. Clark's book, I AM WELL!   Not only am I well, but I am healthy and strong and living fully.<br />Dr. Clark is a tremendous humanitarian.  Her research  is extremely threatening to many, many existing industries, so don't expect  to see this book in the mainstream anytime soon.  Do what I did:  read it,  do it, get well, give it to your friends, watch them get  well.<br />Unfortunately, a small percentage of the people in this world are  truly evil people.  They feel best when others are suffering and dying.  If  you hear someone saying terrible things about Dr. Clark, know you are  talking to one of these people, or to someone who has been totally  misinformed by one of these people.

They are not rained in health, but in cutting up people and drugging them.  <br />This is one of many books I've read on my quest for  health.  On this diet I was UNBELIEVABLY CONSTIPATED.  I later discovered  from my chiropractor that my liver and gall bladder, like most American's,  was already stressed and overloaded and this was an extremely unwise diet.   I ALSO DIDN'T LOSE ANY WEIGHT.<br />For more sound advice, try Dr. Abravanel's  Body Type Diet.  You'll understand why some people can do okay on a high  protein diet.  But, even better, you'll understand your own body and you'll  have a do-able path to health and thiness!  Dr. Abravanel's book is the  VERY BEST health book I've ever read.
