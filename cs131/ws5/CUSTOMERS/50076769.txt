Don't get me wrong, the storyline is excellent and the plot and setting and all that are amazing as well--but where the rubber meets the road, and where this novel becomes impossible to part with, is when you really get to know the characters. Especially, as you would guess, the delightfully passionate, spiritual, imperfect, and charismatic Owen Meany. I have only rarely come across a force of character so compelling and so human as he is.<br /><br />And with everyone else I've talked to who has read this book, we all agree that it's a world populated by such wonderful people that you don't want to have to leave it when the book ends. But the last section of the book is so perfectly suited to the story that I figure if the book had to end, at least it ended right. The whole book is beautiful, thoughtful, and very very Owen (which I mean in the best possible way). I recommend it with my whole heart.	2005-06-01

Because as John writes to the followers of Jesus, we can be sure we know Jesus if we obey his commandments. That is what I found most compelling and helpful about this book--the section where Wittstock listed each of the 125 commands and gave a snippet of interpretation, and a brief sentence explaining who Jesus was speaking to, and any other pertinent circumstances around the speaking of the command. He is right in saying that the Church has in many ways ignored the commanding voice of Jesus; and by writing a book that focuses only on the commanding voice, he throws his voice into the ring in an effort to help bring that voice of Jesus back into the Church.<br /><br />However, I should also say that if I were to recommend this book to a fellow Christian (it would not be appropriate for a person who was not yet a Christian, in my opinion) I would mention a few reservations. First, he includes some theological interpretation of current events (ie, September 11th) that he says came in a revelation from God. Whether or not you agree with his prophetic analysis of these events (I do not) is not the important thing; the reality is it just does not fit with the rest of the book that is centered on specific commands of Jesus given in the Gospels. Second, and the author admits this in the book itself, these commands are taken out of their narrative context. Unless someone already had a good picture of the whole of Jesus' life and ministry, I would be very hesitant to give them this book that focuses only on the commanding voice. Finally, as is probably expected of a book of commands, it feels at times to make following Jesus into just an exercise in moralism; as if all there was to being a Christian was making sure you get it all right.<br /><br />Having named those reservations, I find the author's focus on the commanding voice of Jesus to be an important check for the Church who has stopped listening to it very much. And when taken as part of the larger dialogue of the whole body of Christ, I think Wittstock's focus and voice will be a valuable addition.important check for the Church who has stopped listening to it very much. And when taken as part of the larger dialogue of the whole body of Christ, I think Wittstock's focus and voice will be a valuable addition.	2005-02-08

Like many of the other reviewers, I must agree that this book is pleasing to the eye and visually stimulating in a way that is not common for books that are not explicitly about art or photography. I was sitting in one of my seminary classes flipping through the book, and at least four people who walked by said, \\"That's a beautiful book.\\" The graphics are interesting and eye-catching, with a unique and innovative feel to them. I do not agree with the reviewers who said that the graphics were distracting or disjointed. I found the way the fonts, colors, and graphics worked together to be quite pleasing.<br /><br />This book raises an interesting point about combining artwork with text, and the option of valuing a book's visual beauty in addition to it's textual beauty. This is a point Kirschenbaum makes clearly throughout her book, and it's something to think about.<br /><br />All of that said, I found most of the actual text of the book to be less than fulfilling. Some of it was off-putting, and seemed pretentious and self-important. This is clear even in the title, which predicts that it is causing a \\"Renaissance\\" in the creation of books. However, I applaud Kirschenbaum for the beautiful book she has created, and find her central point (made through the combination visuals and words) to be a compelling idea worth more pondering. But I give it 3 stars because I am yet unconvinced of her thesis, and for me, it is still the text of a book that either makes it or breaks it.	2004-12-07

I echo the opinions of other reviewers in saying that Anne Lamott's honesty and transparency in her descriptions of her internal and external life are refreshing and endearing. I also understand the sentiments of some of the reviewers who found her irreverance, well, too irreverant. She is a self-proclaimed &quot;drama queen&quot; and lives up to that title and then some. Usually her &quot;drama queeniness&quot; is hilarious, because you can tell that her supposed self-centeredness comes from a constant need to prove herself (as she herself admits). She says that she has a superiority complex rooted in an inferiority complex.<br />People who have trouble with this book are wanting to make Anne Lamott a role model instead of a story teller. We can certainly learn from the authenticity and self-awareness shown in the way she tells her stories in this book. She does not shy away from the less flashy aspects of faith--doubt, sin, suffering, etc. and that is what makes this book realistic and honest. She is not writing a story about how we should live our lives, and it is wrong to take that book in this way. But in the end it is a real and engaging story of love and relationships; between her and God, her son, friends, the church, family, and life. It is greatly entertaining, and a refreshing look into someone's life who is as open with her blemishes as with her crowns.	2003-12-27

It is easy to read, and explains everything at a level that anyone, even if they have never done exegesis, will be able to understand. It gives a basic explanation of how to consider historical context, literary context, etc. and how to do a more detailed analysis of a text. Gorman also emphasizes the importance of taking our own context as exegetes into account; realizing that we bring our own lives and cultures into our readings, as much as we try not to. And I appreciated that he brought up that a main point of exegesis (which is often neglected) is for us to ask the question, &quot;If we were to take this passage seriously, how then would we live?&quot;<br />I think this is a good, quick read that will be good for people who want to start doing some responsible Biblical exegesis. However, if you are a graduate student (or anyone for that matter) and already have a basic handle on how to do exegesis and want to do more in-depth study, this is probably not the book you are looking for.	2003-09-08

However, this does not make the book in any way laborious to get through. You will chuckle to yourself many times, and probably even laugh out loud a couple of times. Vonnegut's talent for writing comical satire is certainly up there with Joseph Heller and the other greats; and Cat's Cradle lives up to what you'd expect from a master in his field. This book is a quick read (I read it all during a cross-country plane trip) and will both amuse you and also plant some wacky, but nonetheless ingenius, ideas into your head. Another good one by Vonnegut, it's worth it if you're a fan of his style or are just interested in getting acquainted with his work.	2003-09-03

Bonhoeffer does not mince words; he boldly and succinctly tells us that whether we feel it or not, we are bound in community with other Christians. And, like a good Lutheran, Bonhoeffer makes it clear that this community finds its origin and existence only in Christ and in what *Christ* has done to each believer. He emphasizes that Christian community is not an ideal to be worked towards, but rather a divine reality; which differentiates this work from most other works on community which focus on how to &quot;make community happen.&quot;<br />On that same token, the reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that the second chapter called &quot;The Day with Others&quot; is much weaker than the other four chapters. In this chapter Bonhoeffer strays from laying theological foundations and giving general exhortations, to giving very specific instructions for how the community's daily life should look. He communicates these instructions with the same &quot;this is the only truth&quot; tone that runs through the rest of the book--but in this chapter it seems annoying and pretentious, rather than deeply challenging.<br />All in all, he does much better when laying out general theological principles and describing the foundations of Christian community; which is thankfully what 4/5 of the chapters consist of. This book is obviously written from a deeply convicted place in Bonhoeffer's own heart, and for that reason it has tremendous power to convict and move the hearts and minds of the readers. I recommend it highly.	2003-07-23

But Hinds Feet in High Places has much more heart, and I found it to stir the heart and soul in deep ways. It is the story of Much-Afraid leaving the Valley of Fear that she has always known, and embarking on a journey to become a new creation. The thing about this book is that it talks about the deepest longings and fears of our hearts in following God--following Him when we can't see ahead of us, when we feel like we're going in circles, when we feel like He is not taking us where we want to go, and how following Him can mean laying down the deepest desires of our hearts just because God asks us to, and we know Him to be good and loving. I enjoyed this book immensely, and found it both challenging and filled with grace; which is a rare find in Christian books which often offer only one or the other. All in all this is a love story between Much Afraid and her God; a God who calls her to a path that is filled with sorrow and suffering that take her to a deeper place of dependence on him, and also a God who is there the instant she calls for Him. This is a book that I will probably read every couple of years, as I am at different places in my own journey, and will always see something new that I didn't see before. It is well worth investing in.	2003-04-16

That makes this book by Richard Rohr necessary and helpful to be able to gain the insight of the enneagram from a source that is operating from a Christian worldview. This book has sections on where the enneagram came from, what it is, what the 9 enneagram personality types are, and how Christians can benefit from it without adopting non-Christian ideas. The most helpful part is part II of the book which goes into depth on the 9 types, from a Christian perspective. Most helpful, Rohr identifies the root sin of each type, and how God can redeem that sin into a beautiful gift. He also talks about what gifts the types naturally have, and how we can grow in those. I have heard that the enneagram does not put people in boxes, rather, that it helps people identify what boxes they are already in and how to get out of them. This book is very helpful for understanding yourself and others, and for getting out of the boxes that are keeping you from living in a full and redeemed way.	2003-01-31

First of all, it's not going to take a whole lot of your time--it's pretty quick reading. Second (and more importantly), the case studies and real-life examples contained in this book can be really helpful to getting you more attuned to narcissism and scapegoating characteristics in yourself and others. I did not agree with Dr. Peck that we need to call just this one specific type of character flaw \\"evil.\\" He does not include much of a defense for saying why we need to name a characteristic as \\"evil,\\" other than that in naming we gain some power over it; and this reason doesn't hold up. Dr. Peck is writing from a self-proclaimed Christian worldview, and in his worldview Jesus refers to everyone as evil (\\"If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children...\\" Matt. 7:11, Luke 11:13), and it doesn't make sense that he is choosing to define evil so specifically as to exclude what is normally thought of as evil in addition to that which Jesus referred to. Certainly Peck's given definition of evil falls under the heading of evil, but in this book he offers very little reasoning for why this specific and narrow definition should be sufficient to cover all real \\"evil.\\" Many of his points are not made well, and his main goal to set a psychology of evil still is vastly incomplete (which he admits). However, this book is still well worth reading if only to become more aware of these types of evils in yourself and in the people around you so as to combat them with love, as he advises.	2003-01-10

It is moving, romantic, beautiful, though really idolatrous in a way. At the time though, the beauty and depth of feeling associated with their love seems to outshine any of the idolatry therein. But then, these self-proclaimed pagans enter into the journey of divine love; a love that far outweighs and outshines their love for one another. Love for God becomes supreme for her, and eventually he ends up there too. It is a lovely and true journey that demonstrates that while love between humans can be extremely wonderful and heart-stoppingly intense, the divine love and longings for connection with God are much moreso.<br />Vanauken's writing style is mostly straightforward yet poetically descriptive, and at times breathtakingly gorgeous. One reason his life story translates so well into a written work is that he and Davy (his wife) viewed their life in an almost literary way. Examining each moment and occurrence, they would find significance in their daily life and point to events as foreshadowing changes to come. This book is one of the best love stories I have ever read, especially in terms of putting human love in the appropriate position of deference to love and obedience to God. I recommend it without reservation.	2003-01-02

Maybe if I hadn't read so many of Henri's other books, where he recounts some of the same experiences as in this book, I would have been more moved. It was helpful and touching to read about this relationship Henri had which had such a profound influence on him, and in which his theology culminated. He had been realizing for several years that we are all called the Beloved independent of what we do, have, or how we look--but this was most pronounced for him through his relationship with Adam.<br />So it is worthwhile getting a fuller picture of how Adam taught Henri so many important things about God and himself, but if you have already read many of Nouwen's books (written after he went to L'Arche), much will be repetitive. But evenso, the story and concrete examples of Henri living out his theology are really beautiful. And as someone who works closely with and sees God in people with developmental disabilities, it is wonderful for me to see how Henri saw God in Adam. One of the other reviewers accuses Henri of romanticizing relationships with people with disabilities, but I do not find this to be the case. It was clear that Henri was writing a book about how he encountered Jesus in Adam, and of course focused on incidents that would show that. I did not find the book lacking just because it mainly talked about the peaceful and beautiful moments, because the purpose of the book is to show us how God is in every person, and in a special way in people with disabilities; and it comes across loud and clear. I recommend this short book, though it is definitely not my favorite by Nouwen; it could easily be read in one afternoon.	2002-08-23

Not just because of the intriguing philosophical issues raised, although that certainly adds to the book. The thing about this book is that somehow through reading it, you become transformed. I have read it two times through, and each time I can say that I am not quite the same person I was when I began it. There is a real power in Dostoevsky's words, and he does well to involve the reader as a whole person: mind, flesh, spirit, and emotion.<br />A central issue and question of the novel involves one of the 3 brothers, Alyosha. When the novel begins at the present, Alyosha is in the monastery as a monk. You learn much about his life in the monastery, his theology, and the spiritual ideals he clings to. Then Alyosha leaves the monastery and is called to become \\"a monk in the world.\\" This is a running theme of Dostoevsky, and is especially strong in the Brothers Karamazov. How can one live with such high and lofty spiritual ideals in this world where people murder, steal, mock, and other evils? Watching Alyosha be a monk in the world, and seeing how those spiritual ideals can be applied to a corrupt world is fascinating.<br />This is a wonderful book, and worth investing your time and self into. The measure you put in will be the measure you get back, and still more will be given to you. I cannot emphasize enough how wonderful and powerful I have found this book to be.	2002-08-16

This book is not only interested in giving structural and personal tips for creating a healthy and God-centered community; it actually is like Jean Vanier's manifesto in terms of his paradigm of why community life is important and how God teaches special and beautiful things in the context of communities. He is such an effective writer. He is able to exhort the reader to want to pursue community life, but without being overly idealistic and ignoring the many complex difficulties that arise. Jean exhorts the reader to pursue community life not because it will be easy and always meet all our needs, but because it brings tremendous growth and because God's love and calling are bigger than the problems that come up in community. This is the best book I have ever read on community, and I will likely read it again.	2002-07-17

While I am not an economist, and cannot verify the soundness of the economic theory, the main message of the book is certainly true: there are lots and lots of desperately poor people around the world, and God loves them; and who God loves, we should love too. It is so hard living in the West, especially in a wealthy country like the USA, to have a global perspective that constantly keeps in mind and has compassion for the suffering of the poor in the third world. And considering how much Jesus talks about money and the dangers of being rich, it is valuable to read a book that challenges us to instead store up treasures in heaven. The central messages of this book are really uncontroversial in light of scripture: God loves the poor. We should give generously and effectively. We should love the poor. That's really what this book is saying. From Ron Sider's repeated disclaimers and prefaces to his specific economic suggestions, it doesn't seem Ron Sider is saying there is only one definite way that will truly help the poor. All he's saying is that we must help them. Do unto others.... Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book. The third section was pretty dry and difficult to get through (but with important facts and figures), but the the rest of the book is convicting and inspiring. This is a book that every Christian should read--and approach with an open heart and willingness to make lifestyle changes. Reading this book as a Christian in America is a lot like Jesus' confrontation with the rich young ruler; and after reading it, many people go away sad (or angry!). But imagine the joy in store for the person who really takes this biblical call to love the poor seriously...it's immeasurable.	2002-04-25

But don't let the length fool you. The Path of Freedom is a typical Henri Nouwen book where he cuts right to the heart of the matter: the struggle we experience to let go of the things that bind us and keep us from being truly who we were created to be in this world and how to begin NOW to live out the freedom that we as Christians will have in the next. In wonderful Nouwen fashion, he speaks more to our hearts about who God is and who we are rather than giving practical, tangible advice. Henri bares his soul to us in this book, and talks about the main struggles in his life (related to his belovedness/identity) in the context of an accident that brought him close to death. This, like almost every Nouwen book, is a shining example of what it looks like to truly be a wounded healer. He uses his struggles and vulnerability to point us towards the Goodness of God and the True path of Freedom.	2002-03-05

It is filled with exhortations and insight about the character of God and the nature of people. It is a book about struggling with sin and with realizing that God deserves to be Lord of every aspect of your life--and trying to live that out. It's also a story of the power of prayer, and an encouragement (through his comments about his mother) to persevere in prayer and supplication. Plus, it's just a reminder of the many wonderful aspects of who God is--because every time Augustine says something about God, he affirms something about His character. He will say something like, &quot;God, in whom there is no darkness, has illuminated the eyes of my heart.&quot; It is both a telling of Augustine's own story, and also a story of God. This book is very dense, and packed with thoughts and ideas that must be slowly digested to really take root in our own minds. It's not a book that can or should be read quickly, it should be savored and pondered and given time for much reflection and evaluation. It's a tough book, but I do not think that you need a commentary to fully appreciate it (though an understanding of the time it was written sure wouldn't hurt). Get ready to be exhorted.	2002-01-21

Truly, it doesn't get much better than this. Reading this book as a Christian can be a mind and, hence, life altering experience. It was written to some of Henri's non-Christian friends about how much God loves them (which is certainly true!). And from the way Henri's life consistently pointed towards Jesus and the Gospel, I am sure that his friendship, love, and words to them in conversation were used by God for the good of the hearers. On that note, I would caution using this book alone as something to give to your non-Christian friends; because as Henri used it, it is best backed up by your life, love for your friends, and pointing them towards Jesus in your day to day life, and not as a gift without a relationship.<br />The book is clear, and ultra-concise (you could probably read it in a day or two); yet, the message, of how to live as the Beloved of God amidst a world where there are lies about your identity at every turn, could not be more fundamental to how a Christian lives their life. I wholeheartedly recommend and in fact strongly encourage all Christians to read this book.	2001-12-30

John Ortberg mentions two types of love, a love that happens because of something seen of &quot;value&quot; in the beloved (talent, beauty, wit, etc.), and a love that creates value in the beloved (agape). The rest of the book is an explanation of how we are the beloved ones of God, and how we can live out that belovedness in a world where we feel we have to earn it. Many of the ideas in this book are parallel to those of Henri Nouwen's Life of the Beloved, but Ortberg's style is different in that he offers many stories and illustrations so that the truths become more vivid. While the subtitle (&quot;Moving God's Love from your Head to your Heart&quot;) is a bit of a misnomer because he doesn't offer practical steps to do that, but the book is really a focus on and testament to God's tremendous love for his people; and in that way it brings that truth to a deeper level in the heart.	2001-12-30

Lupton doesn't shy away from the hard questions, but answers them boldly with the words of Jesus. He exhorts us to be radical in our servanthood of our neighbors, and to sacrifice ourselves for others. In other words, he just calls us to what Jesus calls us to. This book is very easy and quick to read, but the lessons learned in this book can be pondered and worked out in a real-life context over and over again. This is certainly one of the best books I have ever read that encourages you to take the Gospel seriously in the inner-city. It's worth far more than the time it will take you to read.	2001-09-18

However, there are also a couple of chapters in the book that were real gems and shouldn't be missed. The first couple of chapters about Henri's fascination with Rembrandt's painting of the prodigal son are average. Even when he goes through the two brothers in the painting (the elder brother and the prodigal), there is nothing here that is extraordinary or newly insightful. Anyone who has done a group study or personal meditation on the passage likely already thought through the implications of being both the young son who is welcomed home, and the obedient elder son who is resentful of the father's welcome to his younger brother. These are certainly wonderful things to ponder, but Henri is far from the first to explore them; so that section of the book is a bit laborious. However, if you have never really thought a lot about the story of the prodigal son, the beginning and middle sections of the book should prove quite interesting. However, what I found very insightful and compelling in this book was the way Henri explored how we are to become like the father. It is a powerful exhortation to accept our homecoming as the younger son, but also to become welcomers ourselves. This book may not hold your attention as well as many of Nouwen's other books, but in the end, it's worth your time.	2001-08-27

His story reminds us that the crux of the Christian life is not flashiness and worldly success, but that it comes from being a servant to the needy and poor of our world. As Henri shares his fears, anxieties, and triumphs of his journey, we are encouraged to face the things keeping us from fully giving our life to the poor (be it mentally, spiritually, financially, emotionally, etc.) and/or are encouraged in the work we are already doing with people society has cast aside. If the 11th chapter of Hebrews was rewritten, Henri Nouwen would be another example of someone who showed great faith in God by taking God at his word and going to a new place where he knew not what would happen to him. As a special education teacher who is involved in the community of people with disabilities, I found Henri to be a true inspiration and encouragement to continue ministering to--and certainly being ministered to by people who have disabilities. This book would be an encouragement to anyone who wants their life to reflect some of the most central teachings of Jesus.	2001-08-15

Nouwen writes beautifully and reminds us that the importance in loving is being able to do so with our whole selves without consideration on how much love we'd be getting back. Several of the sections are particularized to a Catholic seminary lifestyle, but the lessons and insights Nouwen explains can also be generalized to protestant seminary life, life in college fellowships, and just fellowship groups within churches. The later parts of the book are less involved directly with issues of intimacy though. They are more about environments which are conducive to creating healthy intimacy and those which aren't, so it's less directly concerned with personal cultivation of fulfilling intimacy. But there are definitely some good tidbits about intimacy in this book, and if that's an issue you want to have a deeper understanding of, this book is well worth your time.	2001-07-17

But while being entertaining, it is also a poignant narration of the self-centered paranoia of a man who is desperate for people to like him. Unfortunately, because people never have really liked him, he also has a deep disdain for people. So in his thoughts and in his interactions with people, there are evidences of deep longing for companionship interspersed with a contempt for all of humanity.<br />Dostoevsky is one of the most insightful writers of all time. He has provided us, in Notes from Underground, with a character who is really just the average person placed under a magnifying glass. Dostoevsky has done a beautiful job of showing how painful (yet irrational and silly) people's fears and paranoias are. It is one of the best examinations I have ever encountered about how people desire intimacy with other people, and what happens when others do not reciprocate that desire. This is a short book, and I recommend it wholeheartedly.	2001-04-04

It has dramatically altered the way I pray, both in terms of what things I pray about, and what I expect from God during the exchange. John White is a masterful writer who does not shy away from pointing out what our personal weaknesses might be in our prayer lives. He speaks truth boldy. While reading this book I often felt convicted and saw the need for a transformation of how I pray. Daring to Draw Near will show how our prayers should be more God-centered than they probably are, and that they should be more focused on prayers for &quot;our people&quot; and our community. We are challenged to be honest in our prayers about who God really is and about who we are and what we think. If you read this book, your prayer life (and the rest of your life) will never be the same.	2001-03-28

It is really short, and you could definitely read it in less than 2 hours (probably closer to 1 hour). But it will remind you of what being Christian is all about--being genuine and vulnerable, and loving others through that vulnerability. It is a beautiful picture of leadership, and about how as a leader we can be set free to be ourselves and enjoy God and love others. In a lot of ways, Nouwen shows how the most effective leadership is very simple and has been done for a couple thousand years. It's about emptying ourselves, taking up our cross, and sharing that journey with those in our care. This book is well worth the short amount of time it will take to read.	2001-03-20

It is organized by what to pray for daily, and through the book it lists all parts of the world and their prayer concerns and also outlines some of the ways God has already been moving in that region--so it gives your heart a chance, through prayer, to mourn with those who mourn, rejoice with those who rejoice, and to bear one another's burdens. It is far too easy, especially if you live in an affluent country, to forget the struggles our Christian sisters and brothers are facing all over the world. This book can be instrumental in having our hearts be concerned for those things that concern the heart of God. It will definitely reshape your devotional life, perspective on Christian unity, and belief in the efficacy of prayer.	2001-03-13

The excellent thing about this book is that it helps to give the big picture of life and what small events that happen in life can mean in the scheme of things. The first book is about about a man named Christian (you can see that the allegory isn't too hard to understand) and the things that happen to him after he starts on the journey on the road that leads to Heaven. We see how with each step and misstep along the way Christian has the option of continuing on the road to Heaven or giving up, and that helps us readers to realize that the same thing is true in our own lives. Another thing I really like about this book is how even when Christian totally goes off the path and in the wrong direction, God extends grace to him and he is able to return once again to the road to Heaven. The second book is about Christian's wife and family, and is also worth a read. One thing to note though, unless you are extremely comfortable reading old English (which I am not), it would be a good idea to get the modern language version instead of the original; because I read the original and there were several times when I thought about how I probably would prefer a more readable, modern translation. But whichever version you choose, make sure you read this book. It will help you to thoughtfully consider the here and now and also your final destination.	2001-01-24

It is all about how a mother will love her child no matter what he looks like, acts like, where he lives, etc. It's a great portrait of unconditional love. To me, the beauty of this book is that the feelings the mother expresses to the child in this book (that she'll love him no matter what) are many times scrambled in real life through the day to day parent-child activities. But this book helps affirm the reality of unconditional love in a world where it often seems non-existant. If I had kids, I would read this book to them all the time.	2000-12-13

Lewis showed what a brilliant and creative mind he had. This is one of the few books that insightfully delves into answering the question &quot;What does Satan want our lives to be like?&quot; Lewis answers this question by writing from the point of view of a demon--so the language we are used to seeing in Christian books is reversed. God is the Enemy, people are encouraged to end up in Hell, and virtues are turned to vice. It is fun, convicting, poignant, and delightful all at once. While reading through it, I found several times that subtle lies Screwtape (the guide to a younger demon, Wormwood) was encouraging Wormwood to feed into his human's consciousness, are lies that have subtly made their way into my mind as well. So this book definitely has the capability of convicting of sin, and of  revealing incorrect paradigms that we hold about what our lives are about. What I enjoyed most about this book was that it was almost entirely focused on heart condition as opposed to action. As an experienced demon, Screwtape knew that to really turn a human to the dark side you need to focus on his view of the world and his internal motives. This book is short, and it's well-worth at least one read through.<br />As one additional bit of info: if you sometimes have difficulty understanding C.S. Lewis' writings, or just worry that you might be missing something, there is an older version of this book with a study guide by Walter Hooper in the back that is very helpful.	2000-11-06

There is a chapter on incest, one on paternal suicide, one on divorce/abandonment, etc. But the book's focus, is definitely on daughters whose father passed away when she was a child--and it makes sense that this is the focus, because that was the author's (Elyce Wakerman) situation. I, however, was most interested in the stories on divorce/abandonment, but those were few. The chapter on divorce is very good, and the stories included about divorce were helpful because as a child of divorce myself, I was able to resonate with the feelings of other women and to come to grips with the loss that I experienced. But this book was, for me, very unsatisfying. I felt like the times they mentioned the effects of divorce on a daughter were great--but they were few. So if you are a daughter of divorce, I would recommend reading a book devoted entirely to that topic, instead of this one. It is so wide in the range of women it addresses that I would recommend women dealing with father loss to find a book that deals more specifically with their individual situation. That said, this book did provide me with some good insights, and excited the desire to delve more fully into issues of father loss.	2000-10-23

How can the two possibly get along?&quot; He explores this question thoroughly (albeit rehashing and many times inserting sections of his previous works) and there are many points to ponder and paradigm shifting ideas. He examines what our attitude towards God should be (worship) and why that often isn't the case. He also writes about how we are to deal with God even when things in our life are not going well, or at least not according to our plans (his answer to this question is more beautifully answered in his book Disappointment With God, but it's good in this book as well).<br />Yancey is one of the best writers EVER at honestly pointing out how struggles, pain, and everyday problems can be used as tools of growth in our lives if we see their value and use them to draw us to dependence on God. He helps us move out of the realm of blame (e.g., &quot;Why did God do this to me?&quot;) and into a life of dependence (e.g., &quot;I know that God redeems bad situations--so let me use this trial as a way for me to grow and gain more faith and depth of character.&quot;)<br />If you have read all of Yancey's other works, you may find this one repetitive of themes and stories you have already heard; but they're worth hearing again. And if you haven't read any Yancey yet, I'd start off with The Jesus I Never Knew or What's So Amazing About Grace instead. But this book is solid, and carries on the deep questions and themes that all of Yancey's books have had to this point. It is worth your time.<br />[And, as a response to the reviewer who submitted their review (10/19/00) entitled &quot;What am I missing?&quot; I would like to say that what you are missing is the fact that Yancey is not a philosopher. He is a practical Christian writer who writes about following God in the real world--and his books are written mainly for Christians about the reality of the Christian life, not for skeptics who are looking for proof for the existence of a good God. But if that is something you'd be interested in, I recommend God and Other Minds by Alvin Plantinga.]God in the real world--and his books are written mainly for Christians about the reality of the Christian life, not for skeptics who are looking for proof for the existence of a good God.

It is a thought-provoking novel that gives a clear vision of human nature, how our sinful nature came to be, and how it can be defeated. In Perelandra Lewis uses a less confrontational genre (the fictional novel) to deal with deep philosophical questions like &quot;If sin is bad for people, then why does God put that forbidden fruit-tree in the garden of Eden and allow sin into the world?&quot; And the explanation he offers in this novel is deeply satisfying.  Overall, this book is a great read. Lewis is definitely the master of writing fiction that is both beautiful in literary style and philosophically interesting.	2000-10-11

This book is a must read for anyone who wants to have a fuller understanding of who God is and how we can view and work through those feelings of anger and disappointment when He doesn't do what we want him to  do. It's not just for someone going through a dry period in their  relationship with God (although it's GREAT for those dry periods).  Phillip Yancey wrote Disappointment with God after he wrote Where is God  When It Hurts which is about where God is in the midst of our physical  pain. This is because he got a lot of letters from readers of Where is God  When It Hurts who wondered &quot;Where is God when it hurts  emotionally?&quot;<br />So Yancey secluded himself in a cabin for a couple of  weeks and read through the entire Bible, and during that time he realized  many profound things about the character of God as it relates to our  emotional suffering. The first half of the book deals with the character of  God in the Old Testament; and Yancey theorizes(in the context of the people  of Israel) why God might seem/be more hidden or silent to us. His theory  makes so much sense, that when you read it, you'll wonder why you never put  the pieces together before.  The only bit of advice I would offer about  you reading this book would be for you to make sure that you are not  becoming less disappointed with God as a result of expecting less from Him.	2000-07-31

Books	3	60	65	N	N	Contains Helpful Charts	This book is very short, and because of its length it really isn't able to go into depth on any one of the religions discussed. It does cover a lot of territory though, and if you're just looking for a good overview of the  main differences between Evangelical Christianity and other religions, then  this book is really helpful. Especially helpful are the charts included for  each religion which lay out the main things the religion believes about  Jesus, the resurrection, salvation, etc. It covers many of the ways other  religions intersect or blatantly disagree with Evangelical Christianity,  but it leaves out everything about the religions that do not have something  to do with their relation to Evangelicalism. So this book is definitely  helpful to gain a little bit of knowledge on a wide range, but much more  research would be required in order to be able to have a full understanding  of the main world religions.	2000-06-21

If you're having trouble remembering what  Kant means when he uses the words &quot;transcendentalism&quot; and  &quot;ethics&quot; and &quot;pure reason&quot; and stuff like that, this  book will be a good resource. And the definitions aren't just a few words,  many are more than a page. The only warning I would place on this book is  that many of the definitions provided are interpretive of the philosophy  rather than just descriptive. So that could cause a problem if you have a  professor who is fully persuaded in his own interpretation. But overall  this is a good and helpful book to have to quickly reacquaint yourself with  most of Kant's main philosophical ideas and terms.	2000-06-21

There is a reason so many people (including me) have claimed The Catcher in the Rye as their favorite book ever. The reason is that it is quite probably a perfect novel. JD Salinger is an artist with his words. They're  funny and moving and insightful all at the same time. Each line in the book  is a thought in Holden's mind--and while reading it I never got the  impression that I was reading these thoughts. It was like the thoughts were  being poured from Holden's mind into my own, and the words were just  incidental. Phoebe was also my sister. Mr. Ackley was also my teacher. My  heart broke over the death of my brother. I wondered where the ducks flew  from the park. I faked having a bullet wound in my stomach and stumbled  into the bathroom. In all these ways and many many more, JD Salinger is  able to make the reader feel like s/he is right there with Holden through  all of it. And maybe it sounds really corny, because Holden's only a  character and all, but he is so dang likeable that I would marry that guy.  If you haven't read this book, you must. You have to meet Holden. And if  you have already read it, read it again every year to visit Holden and to  remember what the perfect novel is like.	2000-06-21

For so many, the Jesus of the Scriptures who Yancey describes is someone most of us really have never known (even if we've read the Bible before and have gone to church  regularly). The reason Yancey gives in the book for this phenomenon is that  the majority of our Christian churches today do not embody the  characteristics that Jesus had. In a striking example from The Jesus I  Never Knew, Yancey compares the differences in the types of people who were  attracted to hanging out with Jesus (prostitutes, drunkards, and other  types of outcasts) and the types of people who are attracted to most of  today's Christian churches (almost entirely not members of those groups).  And he observes that the fact people on the margins of society are not  drawn to the church shows how far we are away from demonstrating the  characteristics that Jesus demonstrated.<br />If you find that observation  insightful, you will love the rest of this book and likely Yancey's other  books too.	2000-06-21

I mean, because the tone is so depressing and heavy at times (but in a good way), it's easier to read this book as if it were a novel. So even if you  generally don't read non-fiction, this book is worth a try. I liked almost  everything about it. Stylistically it is great. It has a perfect blend of  wit, insight, and sillyness that reminds me of a They Might Be Giants CD.  And Dave is brutally honest about his life and thoughts, even when they're  not flattering to him. Augustine's Confessions is the only other book I  have read where the autobiographer is so forthcoming about his shortcomings  and struggles. (Did I really just compare Dave Eggers to a Saint?) Well,  read the book and decide for yourself whether you think Dave deserves  Sainthood (I think it's a no...). But he does write one heck of an  entertaining book. So read it soon.

When characters speak to each other in  French (to show their aristocratic rank), this edition provides a  translation. It also includes MANY MANY helpful footnotes on culture  traditions of the time, which are essential for anyone not familiar with  Russian culture if they want to have a full understanding of the book. This  version also points out places where Tolstoy used Russian words to create a  pun--and this is helpful, because obviously all the puns were lost in  translation. So read this book!

After reading this book (and doing the workbook excercises) you will have a  fairly good ability to communicate in Russian about common subjects. A good  thing about this book is that its author, Olga Kagan, (who I studied under  at UCLA) adheres to the philosophy that learning a language shouldn't be  done through mere translation  (this-English-word=that-Russian-word), but  should be approached by taking the words in context and by seeing how  Russian phrases/words are used, and not just what they mean.

This book will address that. Are you young and in relatively good health, and have a hard time feeling compassion on people who are older and/or less agile? This book can  increase your compassion and patience. Are you entering the last few years  of your life and want to &quot;finish well&quot;? This book can help you do  that. This book is for everyone; because everyone will deal with death and  dying in their life. Denial of the Soul demonstrates Peck's medical  knowlege combined with his understanding of people and how we deal with and  fear physical pain, and this book forces its reader to think about their  own mortality, grapple with it, and hopefully come to accept it. Peck shows  that death isn't something to live in fear of, but that the dying process  is a beautiful way to learn how to depend on other people and on God--and  that the dying process doesn't have to be wrought with physical pain. It's  really worth it for everyone to read this book at some point, and I would  agree with the other reviewers that it should be sooner rather than later.	2000-05-31

It's interesting to read about a reality so different from the current one; where people think only about how to survive from day to day,  and can't even consider pursuing happiness or frivolity. But by the same  token, while it's interesting to see how this destitute society functions,  it's hard to really feel connected to any of the characters (even Anna, the  protagonist), so the climax doesn't really feel like one, and the ending  seems rather ho-hum. But it's short, and some of the more subtle ideas  about how people work in society are compelling enough to merit taking a  look through this book. But read Auster's Music of Chance or something else  first, or else you might get turned off of a very good author because of  this very average book.	2000-05-30

I really enjoyed reading the autobiographical accounts of how each philosopher came to have belief in God--and it was interesting to see the varied paths that were taken to  reach that belief. I was enthralled by the section written by Peter van  Inwagen. And I was pleasantly surprised by Michael J. Murray's essay. He  offers a rational and intriguing argument on how to reconcile the existence  of an omnibenevolent God with the presence of evil. It's barely mentioned,  and is only one or two paragraphs long, but it's really interesting because  it's not the usual expanation people give for that age-old question. If  you're not familiar with his line of argument, it's worth buying the book  just for that. This book also represents the views of a couple of Jewish  philosophers, so that offers a bit of variety from the Evangelical  Christian and Catholic philosophers. Overall, the essays provoke thought  and provide encouragement to other people who believe in God and also value  rationality.	2000-05-18

Books	5	166	175	N	N	Paradigm Shift	This book is not only about how God views our suffering, and how much we struggle with God in the midst of our suffering (although it does thoroughly discuss those things). The most interesting aspects of this  book, in my opinion, were the stories and comments that Yancey makes on how  Christians, though mostly good-intentioned, often respond to other people's  pain in very unhelpful ways. There is an example of a woman who was very  ill and then examples of a few different people who came to visit her and  how their different approaches affected her. It shows you how to best try  and comfort someone in great pain (although of course there isn't one  universally right way to do it). One of Yancey's most interesting  observations in this book is that the only cards made for sick people are  &quot;get well&quot; cards--and how that shows what society's view is on  sickness and how often times people are only considered valuable if they  are well. Otherwise, they are considered invalids (as he points out, that  word suggests that the person is considered &quot;not valid&quot;). This  book should be read by everyone experiencing chronic pain, anyone who  experiences any kind of pain, and anyone who ever expects to know anyone  who experiences pain. Therefore, everyone should read this book, because  pain continues to be a significant part of life.	2000-05-15

That said, this book is  a good springboard for promoting communication between you and the person  you're dating on setting physical boundaries, figuring out what things need  to be worked on in your relationship, and how to go about increasing  healthy intimacy.	2000-05-15

This is one of those books where everything means something. Every bit of the scenic description  of Heaven and Hell reveals something that Lewis believes to be true about  the two places and how people respond to them. Other fascinating things  about this book are the fictional characters and seeing how different types  of people respond to being in Heaven. There is one man who realizes that  now that he is in Heaven, and in the presence of God, he is no longer  useful. But he doesn't want to start feeling useless, and so cannot enter  the presence of God--because in Heaven God provides for everyone's needs.  This book really makes you contemplate whether Christianity is more about  the journey or the destination. It's entertaining and full of wisdom, and  is a must-read.	2000-05-15
US	50076769	R3KSA6WHPM84GM	0156148633	235102368	The Business of Heaven: Daily Readings from C. S. Lewis	Books	4	29	30	N	N	Overall, a Good Read	Of course, in an ideal world, where we all had tons of free time to read, a book of C.S. Lewis excerpts like this would be useless. But, in the actual world, where sometimes reading has to come next to things like  working, grocery shopping, and sleeping, a book like this one is quite  helpful. It doesn't compare to reading each of his great works in their  entirety, but the excerpts are organized very well, often by theme and/or  work taken from, so there's a feeling of continuity and thoroughness.  Another great thing about this book is that often with C.S. Lewis' works,  the density of things to think about within the pages is so great that a  lot of the cool thoughts and ideas get missed in a normal read-through. But  generally in this book, each daily reading expresses a singular idea, so  there is more time to really let the weight of the thought sink in, and to  spend some time intellectually and emotionally digesting his words. So if  you're a C.S. Lewis fan, or even just a fan of filling your brain with  interesting concepts and insightful analogies, this is a must-have.	2000-05-12

Especially interesting is  Paul's relationship with Miriam, and how he becomes angry that she is  trying to consume his soul--but at the same time, he says that he is  looking for a woman who can belong to him. It seems like a double standard,  but Paul is so obviously dysfuctional that as a reader, I could easily  excuse it. DH Lawrence did a great job of making the content of the book  flow well. When I got to the end, I could just feel that he was going to  have to work Miriam back into the story somehow--and sure enough he did.  And I think that as a reader, when I am able to anticipate what the writer  has left to say, that is really a great statement about the ability of the  writer to bring his readers to the same line of thought about the  characters and the plot that he has. And something that I especially  enjoyed about this book is that it is almost entirely dialogue, and it  doesn't spend pages describing the scenery and such. So if that's something  you like too, then you will probably enjoy this book.	2000-05-04
US	50076769	R24SOWR8WWA628	0842351159	198671323	The Quotable Lewis	Books	5	40	42	N	N	An Excellent Tool	Not only is this book an excellent resource for Christian speakers/preachers/etc., but it can also be of usefulness an individual's personal life by offering words on joy, peace, death, etc. The quotes are  topically organized, and the references back to the original works are very  helpful when you can't quite remember exactly which book contains that C.S.  Lewis quote that has been running through your mind lately. This book is  also helpful if you engage in theological conversations and/or debates. The  quotes included in the book are good encapsulations of the gyst of many of  Lewis' insights into human nature, Divine nature, and Divine human nature.  Some sections that I have found especially helpful in informal  philosophical debates are &quot;Free Will&quot;, &quot;Sin&quot;,  &quot;Human Nature&quot;, and &quot;Love.&quot; Any diehard Lewis fan  (without a photographic memory), who loves being able to quote him in  sermons, academic papers or in conversation, could greatly benefit from  having this book.	2000-04-28

Lewis explains things very clearly, and always has examples to make what he says more understandable. I especially enjoyed his explaination of how our  culture is obsessed with sex, and how he said that if another country did a  striptease with a plate of food, covering and uncovering it for a bunch of  salivating people who paid to watch this, we would be dumbfounded and  astonished and think there was definitely some unhealthy obsession with  food in that culture. But in Western countries (especially America), where  women do the same thing with their bodies, we don't feel that is at all  odd.<br />An important thing I would say about this book though--if you are  going to use it as a tool in evangelism--I think that's great. But I would  not tell non-Christians who are very logical and analytical to read this  book, because I think it could do more harm than good. This is because  often when Lewis makes a point in this book, even if it is correct, he  doesn't back it up with reason, but rather with analogies and hypothetical  situations. So if you are looking for a good book to offer to the  skeptical, rational philosopher types, this probably isn't the best one.  (I'd recommend Descartes' Mediations, Leibniz's Theodicy, or Josh  McDowell's Evidence that Demands a Verdict for people in that group.)	2000-04-28

Lewis wrote (but usually it would be 4 or 5). And when I got this book, I was hoping that it would contain some great  insights from his other books--but simplified so that I could see how even  children are able to understand some of the complexities of the Divine. But  it's nothing of the sort. Most of the letters contained in the book are  rather dull, and many talk about the same books and characters ad nauseum.  Also, while reading it, there is a feeling of discontinuity. If you have  read every single other work by C.S. Lewis, then I guess maybe you should  read this book--but otherwise, there are many other books that would be  more worth your time.	2000-04-28

This book shows how true freedom for us comes by not being enslaved to the opinions of others. Max Lucado tells the story to communicate to children (and most DEFINITELY to adults as well) that by taking time to experience and remember God's love for us, we can have a deep joy that isn't contingent upon whether people bestow praise (represented by gold stars) or  insults (grey dots) upon us. This is a book that I think everyone should  read every morning before we start our day, because this simple story  illustrates a truth that is essential to our peace, yet so hard for us to  keep ahold of. Thank you Max, for reminding us of our infinite and  unchanging worth.	2000-04-27
US	50076769	R2EGSIYG2KQ453	0310517818	858732473	Disappointment with God	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Thoroughly Insightful and Comforting	I have recommended this book to more people than any other book I have  ever read. I've bought it for 6 people, and recommended it to at least a  hundred. This book speaks directly to anyone who has ever felt that God  didn't come through for her/him. And truthfully, it even speaks to people  who don't realize they've felt that way (like me upon first opening the  book).  The first half is where the book really shines. It could be a book  in itself that outlines God's character and love as displayed in the Old  Testament. Yancey examines the character of God throughout the Old  Testament so thoroughly, that I started to wonder why I had never realized  those things before. And I did feel much less disappointed with God after  reading this book. But the reason I only give this book 4 stars is because  I kind of felt like the reason I felt better was not because I had a better  understanding of God's character, but that because of this book I began to  expect less from God (e.g., less of an intimate presence in my life, less  clear direction of a path to take, less answers to my prayers, etc.)--and  thus, am unable to be disappointed.  But overall, this book is so worth  reading that I can't begin to describe it. You won't be able to see God the  same way afterwards.	2000-04-27

Books	5	218	230	N	N	How Sweet the Sound	I have found myself telling people stories and quotes from this book so often that I figured it was time for me to throw my two cents out there. Philip Yancey has almost surpassed C.S. Lewis as the most insightful  Christian writer I have read. And while as a philosopher I greatly  appreciate the idea-based insight that Lewis provides, Yancey's works seem  to offer more practical advice and help to answer the question: &quot;How  then should we live?&quot; After reading this book, I can't see Grace  anymore as just one of those things that's meant to make us feel warm and  fuzzy inside. I mean, Yancey's depictions often do bring those warm and  fuzzy feelings, but more than that, it shows the unquestionable POWER and  STRENGTH that is contained within grace. It's not just a nice, sweet little  virtue that we do because it's easy. This book showed me that Grace is life  changing and necessary. And when I read the part where the civil rights  worker looks out the window and through laughter and tears first  understands what grace really is, that was the moment when I truly began to  understand what grace really is. And it truly is amazing.	2000-04-26
