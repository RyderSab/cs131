Coco, the unconscionable predator, is the one Phoenix must nab, if only she can keep up with this horny killer that knows Phoenix's every move.<br />From the first page, the book simply kidnaps you; there's continuous action, brutal eye-popping scenes, and spicy dialogue sprinkled with humor.<br />For me, Pretenses was a great read because (1) it was a change of pace for me because I am accustomed to reading lots of relationship novels, and (2) the author's writing style is compelling. Keith gives you just enough detail to envision the scene without going overboard.<br />I loved the various settings of the novel, including DC, St. Thomas, and New York. Keith just has a wonderful style that draws you in. I look forward to reading more of his works. Pretenses is highly recommended.	2004-07-15

An easy, quick and fascinating read, I enjoyed learning about Luther's background, his struggles to become a recording artist, and his careers successes and challenges. Although this really isn't a book filled with personal comments by Luther to the biographer, Craig Seymour, you can tell that the author did a great job seamlessly piecing together Luther's history so that it reads logically and thoughtfully. There are sad and poignant moments (the stroke), and many funny moments too (Luther's quick wit and great sense of humor). The squabbles he's had with fellow singers will make you laugh too and shake your head at what goes on behind closed doors within the industry. Even if you aren't a Luther Vandross fan, if you enjoy reading about a slice of R&amp;B music history, you may enjoy reading this book. The book provides a fascinating and dramatic look at the music industry, and it simultaneously honors Luther Vandross with grace and honesty. It's highly recommended and may give you a greater appreciation for Luther, as well as entertainment in general.	2004-07-09
US	50822047	R3PND3D4PSKFWU	1401352154	131922247	Bling	Books	5	16	18	N	N	A splash debut	Lucrative recording contracts, shopping sprees, singing stars, paparazzi, sex, and life lived on the hip-hop edge. This is what you'll find in BLING, the splashy debut by Erica Kennedy. The story centers on Mimi, a twenty-something girl from Ohio who dreams of getting a record contract. She and her singing friends travel to New York to make the dream come true. The road the Mimi travels is one she could never predict and her life changes almost instantly when she hooks up with a hip-hop producer named Lamont.<br />The book is filled with short chapters and the plot moves at a fast pace. BLING is a likable page-turner. It provides a fascinating glimpse of the recording industry and can provide as a textbook of sorts for those who aspire to become a part of the hip-hop industry. There are tons of characters in this book, and at times the lines are belly-aching funny. There's plenty of fresh and hip characters who all talk the latest lingo, all of which may have you think you're reading from the pages of VIBE. Most of the characters will make you try to guess the real-life counterparts because there are plenty of similarities between BLING's subplots and actual hip-hop celebrities.<br />The only distractions are the mountains of background information about the minor characters. These narratives somewhat diminish the action and intensity of the story, but nevertheless BLING is an out-the-box hit; it's a recommended read that should appeal to those who love urban fiction, hip-hop music, and rags to riches African-American stories.	2004-06-03

The story is set in 1970's Detroit and is a tasty slice of memorabilia that takes you back to a time that is founded upon Motown music (Stevie Wonder), bicycles with banana seats, TV shows like Chico and the Man, and adventurous rides to Belle Isle park.<br />Bridgett M. Davis has written a book that is a flavorful delight. This writer is tough with a pen; her words evoke sharp images, and she is adept at taking you into the past. I marveled at her accurate descriptions of 70's Detroit life. If you grew up during this time, it's like she's describing your childhood, escorting you back into time, and causing you to reflect on how life was, and how it is now.<br />If you love well-written stories with a strong feel for nostalgia, family, and the joys and pains of growing up, you may also find great value in SHIFTING THROUGH NEUTRAL.	2004-06-03

Set in Philadelphia, the guy and his crew get entangled in committing sexual acts for cash. But easy money never came so hard. The drama that unfolds from the consequences stemming from the main character's decisions will keep you turning the pages.<br />This fast-paced novel is raw, funny, and entertaining. As a cautionary note, there's huge doses of coarse language, which is what you'd expect from an urban story. And the characterizations are visual and well done. What's missing from the book is more description regarding setting or sense of place (rooms/furniture/textures), which is needed so you can feel like you're there in the room, feeling, seeing & touching everything that the characters touch.<br />But what is likable about the book is how smoothly the author grabs the reader -- his easy-going writing voice seizes your attention, and his unique spin on sex, crime, family and friendships are enlightening.<br />Three snaps and a circle for Mister Mann Frisby - this funky urban storyteller's ability to illustrate another perspective, an uglier, but authentic side regarding life's dangers, makes Blinking Red Light an admirable debut.	2004-05-02

Set in the upscale area of Ladera Heights, the story revolves around several well-to-do brothers and the various dynamics within their familial relationships.  Marissa's characters are so engaging, and she really takes her characters through all kinds of life changes. The book is filled with humor, suspense, and tons of twists that capture the various shifts relationships may take when they are tested. What makes this work is it shows you a side of life that you may not know: what wealthy and famous African-Americans may go through, and their similarities and differences from the common man. A classic Los Angeles novel, HOT BOYZ is erotic, funny, and a contemporary page-turner -- Marissa's most ambitious work yet.	2004-04-30

It is annoying to read about a character that is nameless. Why? Because when you have a lot of readers and everyone is trying to discuss the book and calls the characters' different names, it just feels wrong and pointless.<br />What is so hard about giving a character a name? Even a first name will suffice. Just bring that back to your work so there can be some kind of unified feeling about who we are reading about. I think it would help your books and not hinder them. Thanks.	2004-01-23

Warning: Get ready for a energy-laced, outrageous ride that details the adventures of two brothers and their sister.<br />Trent, Trent, Trent, is the ultimate player that takes scandal to a new level in this book. He's a babe-magnet and takes full advantage of his player skills. His brother Wil is having marital problems with Diane; maybe Wil's new temp Mimi can relieve some of his bedroom anxieties, and Melanie, the sister, has troubles of her own to deal with including developing a relationship with an irresistible new man, and trying to decipher the behavior of her flaky acting roommate Desiree.<br />There's wild plot changes, pretty much, with each chapter. Just when you think the action can't get any more zany, something else goes down to make you shake your head. Although the scenes appear outrageous, if you're honest you know that somewhere out there, people like this do exist in real life.<br />My favorite part of this book, the thing that makes it the most worthwhile, is the climatic ending. The final scene may cause you to burst out laughing so loudly that you won't care if anyone hears you. PLAYERS HATERS is a must-read, with an unforgettable ending, and is brimming with enough male/female drama to keep you turning the pages.	2004-01-19

It seemed good things rarely happened to the Evans family and you frequently found yourself wishing for something great to happen that would whisk them out of their unfortunate existence. Well, The Darkest Child is like the literary equivalent of Good Times, except this story takes place in a house on Penyon Road, somewhere in the state of Georgia during the late 50's. And this time the sorrows and afflictions experienced by the family comes at the hand of the mother, Rosie, a woman who inflicted so much abuse on her ten kids that you cannot keep up.<br />The story is narrated by Tangy Mae, a fifteen year-old woman/child that the mother labels as ugly. The mother sleeps with men, chain smokes, drinks, cries, yells, and does all kinds of unusual and disturbing things that make the reader feel sorry for the kids and wonder about their eventual outcome.<br />The Darkest Child's strength lies in its commanding writing voice and vivid descriptions. Some of the painful scenes make you physically react, as if you're being abused instead of the children.<br />The worst thing about the book is there are far too many characters; you may not feel attached to each of them or remember which one is which, but the story is still compelling enough to keep you drawn to the characters' dilemma. In addition it would have been great if the mother's behavior was explained so the reader could know her motivations behind her horrendous actions.<br />This book is highly recommended because of its originality, excellent writing, and unpredictability, and because, as far as I know, there aren't too many books that can be compared to The Darkest Child. It is an engaging and dark read that won't be soon forgotten.	2004-01-11

Now they are married and contemplating decisions and dealing with issues that may affect their family. In addition, the colorful O.J. Peters makes a return and provides some thought-provoking and memorable scenes<br />One good thing about this book is it lets the reader know what some men think when it comes to jobs, wives, companions, families, and their relationship with a baby's mama, and does so in a way that is insightful.<br />C.

Church business and other commitments weigh on Mariah's mind, and the choices made by Pastor Black threaten to uproot everything important to him.<br />Roby's fan will have a great time catching up with Curtis. Too Much of A Good Thing is humorous, emotional, and eye-opening; the only question you may have at the end of the book is Curtis's motivations for the questionable decisions he makes.<br />Roby shines in her latest novel and the book is highly recommended.	2004-01-06

One that opens up your eyes to a world that you didn't really existed. It's a flavor-filled coffee table book bursting with wondrous history. And it truly embodies the human spirit as the voices of people from different races and cultures all share their common bond of living and/or working in Harlem.<br />The Spirit of Harlem is just that - a spirit of discovery that races through from the pages and causes you to learn things you've never heard before. Even if you've haven't been to Harlem, the book makes you proud and happy to know that such a place exists. This important and heartwarming book is highly recommended.	2003-12-07

A hip and street-wise thriller.<br />I've always enjoyed Franklin White's writing and consider him a standout among African American writers. With favorites such as Fed Up With the Fanny and Cup of Love, the wait for his newest novel, Money for Good is well worth it. An absorbing and nicely written page-turner, Money for Good sparkles and pops with funky dialogue, laugh out loud humor, and enhancing visuals.

With a memorable cast of characters, there's a lot to enjoy about Money for Good; a well-developed street novel packed with enough twists and turns to keep you turning the pages until you reach the end. This book has the feel of a movie, it seems as if you're right there on the streets with the characters, and going through everything that they endured.

The novel starts off introducing us to Alize and Hennesey (teenage twins who are opposite in behavior and demeanor), and to their mother Livvy, a frustrated but earnest woman who hopes to become a nurse and try to live a better life for her kids when it comes to her relationship with men.<br />The action sparkles and pops while reading about the adventures and attitudes of Alize, a hoochie mama with a mouth that takes no prisoners.

Hennesey, smart and ambitious, has her own problems to solve when she meets a guy who is trying to gain her admiration.<br />For the first part of the book, the story does a lot of build up as other minor yet critical characters are introduced. By the last third of the novel, the action and intensity may have you gripping the pages to see what happens next. RM Johnson takes these characters and puts them through all kinds of conflict, causing them to discover the importance of family, trust, sacrifice, and commitment. The novel is as good as my favorite Love Frustration, and should be embraced and enjoyed by his many fans.	2003-09-01

She is both brave and timid, sometimes releasing herself to accept what she feels deep inside so she can grasp the new and precious things that life has to offer. Pearl Cleage's writing sings in this refreshing and vivid novel, and her mastery of language is admirable. Cleage takes all manner of words, and connects them together like a fine piece of tapestry to create a moving and enriching story. Your social sensibilities might be stirred, and you may even find a little romance in this highly recommended novel that celebrates humanistic strength and integrity.	2003-08-26

L.; they're typical boys who want to shoot hoops, buy a slice of pizza in a New York City neighborhood, or play with a Game Boy. But things are never the same when Bobby gets Nia pregnant; she's flipping out about this baby developing inside her belly, and Bobby is learning all too fast what it takes to be a daddy and a man.<br />Bobby narrates the story, explaining all the feelings he has for his new baby daughter called Feather. It seems everything he does these days must be done in consideration of his daughter. Bobby and Feather are irrevocably tied together and Bobby is trying his best to cope with the joys and challenges of his new role.<br />The First Part Last may serve as a realistic wake-up call for teenagers who are experimenting with sex and who think pregnancy, motherhood, or fatherhood cannot happen to them. The book describes a lot of what being a parent entails and teens may think twice about what they'd want for their own future; being tied to a baby, or maybe having better alternatives about the direction for their lives.<br />One thing missing from the book is intensity. The narrator's voice is mild throughout the story so you never feel like anything explosive is about to happen. But maybe that is the writer's intent - that the reality of parenthood is explosive enough. The First Part Last is a brief and important book for teens to check out, and perhaps their parents too.	2003-07-30

The language was very different. You had to really think about what the writer was attempting to express which made the flow of the story tough at best. I guess it could be called literary, which I tend to stay away from because I rarely get anything out of those types of works.<br />While I applaud the writer for being different in that she uses unusual techniques to get across her message, it is imperative that a reader be able to understand the story, or else they are not going to be edified. Just write with simplicity and effectivness and hopefully it will make things go a whole lot easier.	2003-06-26

Saw it on a table in a Borders bookstore; took a peek, and started laughing right then. A few weeks later I bought the book and read it within a few hours. The thing I remember the most about Skinny Women Are Evil is laughing. Screaming. Wiping tears. Gasping for breath. It's a very funny book and may just affect you to that degree. Mo'Nique is a brash, unapologetic, tell-it-like-it-is type of sistah. And although I couldn't relate to most of the scenarios she described for her life as a big women, I could relate to some. (Eg. Last year this short and skinny guy asked me if I was pregnant. Very embarrassing to have a fat tummy but no baby is inside. Oh well.). A lot of her material, however, should be relatable whether you're a thick sistah or a skinny one. It's all about how we treat others regardless of size, and how we feel about ourselves regardless of size. The writing style is conversational and laid back. She lays it on thick when it comes to folk who have hurt her in the past; and you find yourself rooting for Mo'Nique and admiring her spunk and determination to make it in show business. It is a book that might cause you to think and I applaud her for having the guts to reveal what is on her mind.	2003-05-05

It has that fast, fun, delightfully wicked vibe that many books have when they're set in the shopping Mecca of New York City. The scenarios are funny and entertaining and have the ability to capture your attention. But about mid-way, for whatever reason, Andrea's narration starts to sound repetitive, like the plot doesn't really know where to go, so it starts running around in circles. But because you're curious and pulled in, you keep reading just to see what happens. But admittedly, the level of intensity declines and you may grow a little frustrated. Yet, there are so many beginnings chapters that are eye-opening in terms of the fashion industry, that the book is worth taking a look.<br />I am curious to see what other readers have to say about The Devil Wears Prada.	2003-04-17

It's culturally rich, yet relatable as it deals with the universal themes of women, friendship, family, work, and relationship issues. The content is heavy on the Spanish, but it's a very sophisticated novel, textured, detailed, and is eye-opening in many ways in terms of exposing cultural stereotypes uncommonly known.<br />Some scenes caused the hair to rise on my neck and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Fantastic plot twists, great description that places the reader in the scene (whether you're in Boston, LA, or Rome), there are dozens of compelling scenes, and so many elements of life and love which ring with honesty regardless of your ethnicity.<br />This is the book to get, the book to read, the book that will cause tongues to wag from the East Coast, to the West Coast and beyond. It's a kicker of a novel, one of those types where the more you read, the better it gets, and the warmer you feel. Women all over will be cheering for The Dirty Girls Social Club.	2003-04-09

Not only does the book get up close and personal with 35 or so of the most notable filmmakers of our time, it also serves as a historical context for black film, and provides information not commonly known about our favorite actors (including how Tupac got his first role in Juice), scripts, budgets, television productions, and the many problems encountered and conquered when it comes to filmmakers such as Spike Lee, George Tillman, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Robert Townsend, John Singleton, and many more.<br />The book is upfront about the racial and discriminatory issues that plague the industry and how, perhaps, one should approach filmmaking once they are aware of all the long standing issues. You get to read which scene Spike Lee regrets out of the dozens of movies he's made; you get to read what kind of power, if any, do successful black filmmakers have; you get to know their feelings about the current slate of movies that are being released, how directors prepare for shoots, just a wealth of vital information and tidbits that will broaden your knowledge about the industry.<br />Although the age range, gender, and backgrounds of the interviewees vary, one common bond is their love for film. Why We Make Movies is an important, eye-opening account that will cause your view of the magic of films to be enhanced.	2003-04-02

Marcus Major has always delivered when it comes to writing funny, insightful, and well-written books. And his third novel A Man Most Worthy is the best one yet. Not only does he bring forth living and breathing characters such as millionaire John Sebastian and his joke-cracking buddy Jules, Major also does a fine job of illustrating the female characters Josephine and her friend Gloria. From girltalk, to the way women feel regarding sex, men, marriage, and workplace issues, this novel is a realistic and romantic page-turner that will delight and inspire. It hits on important issues in a good-natured yet thought-provoking manner; the stakes just got higher in the African-American contemporary novel forum, and Major is definitely one of its most talented leaders.	2002-12-27

And readers may love Shemone, a passionate and ambitious woman who isn't perfect, but is caring and tries to be fair and sensitive.<br />The only criticism is Shemone's tendency to rehash to her girlfriend everything that happened between herself and Darnell. Instead of repeating scenes via dialogue, it would have been great if Shemone revealed new and fresh information which might have advanced the momentum.<br />Lovers of realistic relationship stories may find great pleasure in reading A Pair Like No Otha'.	2002-12-10

Boles skillfully has written a novel that covers the trials and tribulations of a young, well-off engaged couple.

Laughing because it is funny when a normally conservative guy decides he wants to learn how to become a 'dog' so he can score with the women. But it's not as if he wants all women, just one particular one named Nikki, a female who doesn't seem interested in Mitchell until he shows her a different side.<br />The caution, though, comes when the reader sees the consequences and drama that may ensue when a man makes a choice to be reckless in his dating/relationships. Using hip dialogue, relationship analysis, and fairly presenting both sides of the issues regarding male and female relationships, this novel should make a connection with both men and women.<br />There are tons of characters in the book so you have to make sure and keep up, however the story pace is fast, the male antics are funny, and the end resolution is suitable in this charming and commendable novel from C. Kelly Robinson.	2002-10-21

Her latest, True Lies, is one of the tightest novels she's ever written. The story revolves around a sincere, goal-oriented, but problem-plagued man named Rick who has fathered a child with an unstable drama queen named Gina.  Although they are no longer a couple, Rick dotes on their daughter, four-year-old Kanisha, and dealing with Gina emotionally sends him to places he never wanted to go. Through it all Rick tries to develop a romance with Dajah, a woman who sometimes gets frustrated with the drama, a woman that Rick hopes will make his life complete.<br />True Lies reads like a movie; it's very vivid, and the characters are so well drawn that when you read the dialogue, you can literally hear their voices. Margaret Johnson-Hodge shapes and sculpts her characters with amazing precision; she doesn't make all men look bad, or all baby mamas look trifling. She digs deep and helps the reader to understand the characters' motivations for the decisions they make.<br />The novel takes surprising turns that may cause one to talk out loud to the book, grow disgusted with some of the characters' decisions, and make you feel as if this story could be anybody's. True Lies is just that authentic.  This is a commanding and appealing novel, and it's highly recommended.	2002-09-21

It's the type of book that may remind you of Friends and Lovers, offering you page after page of characters filled with passions that become their snare; characters that go through so much you can't help but wonder what's going to happen next.<br />Cheryl Robinson is a superb writer.

There's plenty of overeating going on, surfing chat rooms in a quest to find a satisfactory relationship, and drama-filled encounters with unforgettable characters who challenge Katie to define who she is and who she wants to be. This wonderful debut novel is well-written, endearing, has twists and turns, and is thick with hearty chuckles. Furthermore, novelist Cris Burks is adept at writing descriptions and creating laugh-out-loud metaphors which should provide readers with an enjoyable experience as opposed to having them plow through a story filled with overused clich&eacute;s and adverbs.  One aspect that could have made this great novel even greater is increased dialogue between the characters so that we can get to know them through showing versus telling. In summary, SilkyDreamGirl is a reader's delight, and a welcome new voice to the world of African-American fiction.	2002-09-20

He and his 10-year-old daughter Samantha move from Chicago to Houston so he can begin a job as a big time radio talk show host. But one tiny thing happens before he moves that spills itself over into his new life: He makes the mistake of meeting Olivia Brown, beautiful on the outside, deranged on the inside. After one night of unforgettable sex, Olivia can't get Julian out of her mind; especially after he makes his intentions clear. He had fun, but now it's time to go on. She should accept and understand that, but even when there's a supposed understanding between a man and woman, things can still become murky and out of control.<br />God's Gift to Women is a fast, lightweight, and funny read that may remind some of The Maintenance Man. The action is swift, with a little bit of behind-the-scenes insight of urban talk radio in America. The most emotional part comes from the appearance of Samantha, Julian's spunky daughter who seems a lot older than her age. On the constructive side, the book has numerous typos which hopefully can be corrected when the book goes into a second printing. But more importantly, the book does show how frightening it can be for a man who is stalked, and how emotional women can become if they have a different understanding when it comes to their relationship with a man that they feel they love.	2002-09-20

This streetwise yet educational story is about the fascinating Leslie -- voodoo priestess, murderer, or a misunderstood young college student?<br />The setting is New Orleans, on the campus of Dillard University. Leslie is different, alluring, mysterious, and has a lot going on underneath her darkened skin. On one hand she seems like everybody else (a student, a restaurant worker, and a person who's concerned about her family members). But Leslie's mindset is what keeps you turning the pages; maybe you can uncover the motivations of this young lady who has her roommates scared yet in awe of her -- the things she says, the expressions on her face, the unsettling feeling she gives to everyone around her.<br />The solid pacing gives this story an element of suspense and excitement. You never really know what's going to happen next. And the language of the novel is simply beautiful - a rhythmic mixture of street slang and French (plus the wonderful interpretations so the reader can understand what's being said between the characters). And there are expressions you've never read before that will make you laugh, or make you think.<br />This novel is a great and commendable effort, flavorful, spicy with good characterizations and social commentary that covers the goings-on of the hood interspersed with the challenges of a mysterious college student.<br />This is the best Omar Tyree novel to date.

Lynn Harris's books is seldom a breeze. Because although you immensely enjoy the book, from the plot, to the characters, to the dialogue, and the resolution, by the time you're ready to write the review, adequate words seem to disappear. And with his latest, A Love of My Own, a steamy and dramatic page-turner, let's just say that E. Lynn has done it again.<br />Harris's mastery of class issues, romance, friendship and family takes readers on a whirlwind and delicious romp through New York. The novel's time period includes the 9/11 attacks, and the writing is done with such sensitivity and beauty, you relive that historical period once more, and through the characters you're able to know some of NYC's reaction during that tragedy.<br />Old characters like Raymond Tyler &amp; John Basil Henderson, and new characters such as Zola Denise Norwood quickly develop into friends. You are pulled into their storylines and are concerned about the characters' outcome. You feel sympathy for their plight, their search for true love, and you want justice to abound when unfair things take place in the characters' lives.<br />E. Lynn is simply the best at what he does. His novels create great excitement and anticipation. And more importantly, he makes African-Americans proud because of the classy way he conducts himself, never forgetting to acknowledge his fans and helping them to feel a part of his astounding success.<br />If this review doesn't make sense, it's not intentional; it's just a giddy reaction to an engaging book, and one of the finest authors out there today.	2002-08-03

Mariah, the narrator, is calm, observant, and seems certain of herself even when she's not sure.

Mariah is hurting over the lack of a relationship with her father. She and her new lover, Malik, have father-child issues in common. Maybe it's the thing that bonds them, besides the obvious physical attractions.<br />The most powerful scene deals with Mariah's acceptance of her father's decision to leave when she was a child. Emotional and vivid with an element of healing, the scene makes that necessary connection to its reader, enough to ensure that the author wrote from the depths of her heart, and perhaps her pain.<br />May December Souls is a recommended read; it's a contemporary novel that will make you laugh, make you feel, and make you think.	2002-04-24

Intelligent, independent, and attractive, she witnesses the thrashing that Porter, a white reporter, gets from revelers while he's trying to cover the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.  Lee steps in, rescuing him from further harm. Porter never forgets her, wants to see her again.  When Lee applies for and gets offered another job in Philadelphia, at the same newspaper in which Porter is employed, he is elated to again cross paths with a woman who not only rescued him, but who subsequently amazes and charms him. With persistence he becomes a friend, then a lover. And with time, Porter examines his motivations for loving a black woman like Lee, a love that he justifies, a love that torments him.<br />Meeting of the Waters is a pure joy to read. At times funny and reflective, it is the consummate novel, one that provides a balanced viewpoint from both white and black perspectives. The characters are living, breathing, fascinating and passionate. Lee's love for Porter and vice versa is believable, and no matter how hard you might be tempted to frown upon their relationship, just because, you cannot. The author's style is conventional yet has a certain rhythm, a hard softness that gives the reader a delicious journey they'll want to savor. And the conclusion?  Perfect, not fairy tale, not predictable, but a satisfactory conclusion to a superb and commendable story.	2002-03-06

It was a cool read because it was different from the norm. At times High Maintenance is painful to read (the main character Liv Kellerman really goes through a lot mentally and physically). At times the dialogue and Liv's thought processes are funny. And at times you get a sense of sadness. She wasn't the most positive character in the world, you probably will not like her that much, but the point is even if a main character is unlikable it doesn't mean she won't have a story to tell.<br />I liked the novel a lot because of its quirkiness, and if you've never been to NYC before, you'd probably want to go after reading High Maintenance. The visual descriptions of all the restaurants, &amp; regional areas I've heard about for years placed me in that city without me really having to be there.<br />Now her relationship with that weirdo Andrew was a little perplexing. Liv and Andrew were two lost souls drawn to each other and even though their antics were repulsive, their relationship was believable because odd sorts do attract one another. Everyone doesn't have to be perfectly matched to want to be around each other.<br />My take is this: Anyone who wants to escape the normal female empowerment novel  may want to give High Maintenance a try, just to learn that it takes all kinds of people to make up this world.	2002-02-13

His prose is simple yet profound. This book leaves its footprints throughout Detroit, and the descriptions regarding the settings are so on point, you feel as if you're given a bird's eye view of all the action.

Demetria, Cliff's wife of nine years, wants out - but Cliff wants another chance. He questions why Demetria is so hell-bent on divorcing him and breaking up their family structure - one that consists of their two adorable young sons, Braddie and Bear.  When Demetria makes Cliff understand that she is hardly kidding, he's forced to seek new methods to handle what life is dealing him, and at times his sorrows cause him to turn to his brothers: Nathan, a pastor and family man who's caught inside his own web of frustrations, and Victor, AKA \\"Ice\\", a no-nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is, brother with a heartfelt appreciation for large breasted women.<br />Bittersweet is filled with much thought-provoking issues as it examines the challenges men face when they want to either (1) stay married, or (2) maintain custody of the children. Although some men may have noble intentions, their desires seem to be secondary to a system that doesn't favor participant dads. And there's plenty of educating going on in Bittersweet as Cliff, a man who wears his heart on his sleeve, tries to maneuver his way back into a relationship with a wife who fights his reconciliatory attempts every step of the way.<br />The laugh-out-loud, streetwise philosophies of Victor, however, are what make Bittersweet an entertainment smorgasbord.  Victor, a fellow who never holds his tongue when it comes to voicing his opinion, is nurturing and protective of his baby brother Cliff and warns him to not continually gripe about his woes to other people because, \\"...half the suckas don't care about your problems, and the other half is glad you got `em.\\"<br />Victor's voice is one of the strongest to emerge from fiction in recent years and may remind some of Franklin, the main male character in Terry McMillan's Disappearing Act. But don't despair. Writer Freddie Johnson isn't duplicating what's already been done, instead his success may lie in the fine way he brings a fresh voice to a literary arena that's thirsty for writing that can be streetwise, contemporary, compelling, and lyrical with lessons learned by the time the book comes to a close.<br />Bittersweet should be one of the most memorable and beloved reads of 2002 and is highly recommended.one, instead his success may lie in the fine way he brings a fresh voice to a literary arena that's thirsty for writing that can be streetwise, contemporary, compelling, and lyrical with lessons learned by the time the book comes to a close. <br />Bittersweet should be one of the most memorable and beloved reads of 2002 and is highly recommended.	2002-01-02

Yet she wants to do the right thing; pleasing her husband-to-be is important, but pleasing the Lord is Anya's deepest desire.<br />What makes this story work so well is the soothing voice in which the story is told. Although Anya and Braxton have several conflicts, the smooth, fast-paced writing makes reading this story a delight. In addition, the plotting is seamless. Victoria Christopher Murray does a fine job holding the readers' attention while introducing different plot changes, which create an air of mystery.  While reading Joy, the reader will sense that someone wants to harm Anya and you'll be compelled to stay with the story until you find out who the aggressor is and how she plans to handle that dilemma.<br />Lastly, the story is heavily seasoned with Christian themes, ministerial references and the biblical way to deal with life's problems. Fortunately, the tone isn't too preachy; quite naturally you'll sense that the writer is trying to get those positive messages through, yet you'll still understand that it is the characters' world she's referring to. Yet the story is done so well, that if the reader wants to employ the solutions that Anya takes for herself, you know you're getting more than just a good story to read, but enlightenment for your own life too.	2001-12-09

Each of his books, at least when it comes to storylines, are distinctive and rarely overlap.  The not-so-good news is he does tend to employ a style that suggests he is comfortable with writing stories in the way he's done for the past few novels.  It would be good to see him stretch in that area, but, of course, that is his decision.<br />The narrator of this story is named Darin who's been a friend to John since childhood and grew up to be his manager when he decided to pursue music as a career and became Loverboy.  Darin is pretty likeable as he tries to provide companionship and guidance for his talented friend's musical career. But in reading this story, I guess I wanted to see the characters develop and mature to the point that they were interested in other things besides sexing, making money, and other superficial things. It would have been wonderful to see the deeper sides of Darin and John, not just exposing their demons, but showing us why they are that way and seeing some kind of gradual development that shows them maturing or learning something worthwhile when it comes to the things of life.<br />I loved the information the writer included as far as the music industry, the inner workings of touring and promoting side knowledge, etc. That was fine. The pacing was pretty fast but it seemed the scenarios tended to repeat themselves from chapter to chapter and I was eager to see other drama develop besides the things going on with the groupies, etc. Also I didn't like how Loverboy acted when he lost a major musical award.  In reality, he should not have cared, should have been more concerned about developing and nurturing his gift, and knowing that it doesn't matter if people crown you with rewards or not. Are you living your life's purpose and being fulfilled while doing so?<br />Overall, Just Say No! was a decent read and I do recommend the book because I feel each person should judge a writer's work on his own and not merely rely on other reviewers' opinions before making a purchase decision.read and I do recommend the book because I feel each person should judge a writer's work on his own and not merely rely on other reviewers' opinions before making a purchase decision.	2001-12-07

Nina's trek is challenged by the disappointment she feels in her parents' unfulfilling marriage, an anger that is rooted in her observance of the demeaning way her father treats her too-willing-to-do-anything-to-please mother. It's this treatment that makes her want to be with a man that respects and nurtures her, and with the entrance of basketball player Maurice into her life, perhaps reciprocal love is something she can enjoy for herself. Of course, conflict enters the picture and things go awry for Nina; she's forced to make tough decisions regarding her father, and she is forced to see her mom in a different light, a light that proves to be a guiding force for a woman seeking answers.<br />Tajuana TJ Butler provides wonderful insight into the challenges of relationships through her outstanding development of characters. She gives the cold reality of how things don't always go the way we want, that there are times our own decision-making is the reason why we suffer the pain that we do.  Another enjoyable aspect of Hand-Me-Down Heartache is the voice in which the story is written; Nina's narration flows with honesty, it's poignant, and calming at times, hysterical and wounded at others.<br />If you're looking for a novel that shows the human side of womanhood, the side that is not afraid to admit the quest for happiness is not always happy, then you should try Hand-Me-Down Heartache, a novel which may show you the blessings you have in your own life, or the direction you should go in order to change some things.	2001-11-10

However, I must say that from the beginning paragraph, I knew that this particular read would be kind of different than what I am accustomed to reading.  For me, The Absence of Nectar was fascinating and well-written with the strongest praise being reserved for Hepinstall's characterizations of the folks (and even the dog). We have an observant, bold, if not spooky eleven-year-old narrator, Alice, her wimpy yet sensitive brother, Boone, her clueless yet not so dumb mother, Meg, the psychotic step-father, Simon, and the mystical &amp; uncomparable, Presley. I loved the plot twists because they kept me turning the pages. I loved the language and action.  Only thing I didn't care for was the over-abundant descriptions of various poisions. Felt that part was a little overdone.  If you're looking for a suspensful story that includes vivid and full characterizations, graphic descriptions of unpleasant yet fascinating situations, and great dialogue, The Absence of Nectar would be a wise choice.<br />C.

Roxanne Steele, a sassy, loving, and vivacious woman who is married to Jamal, a wealthy and famous football player, deals with this and more in this delightful story about love, commitment, friendship, trust, betrayal, and family.<br />Fortunately, Roxy doesn't have to bear her troubles alone. First of all there is Lincoln, her handsome and protective best friend that she's known since childhood; Linc has also become Jamal's teammate and good friend. Then there are her female buddies, Cynthia, Monique, and Gayle. And let's not forget her mother who is dealing with her own troubles but tries to be there for her daughter.<br />Near Perfect, the sequel to Nothing But the Rent, is a solid and magnificent effort from writer Sharon Mitchell. It's filled with everything I love in a novel:  Humor, suspense, an array of emotions, tension, romance, eroticism, believable dialogue, fully developed, vibrant and realistic characters, a unique plot with several twists, and fluid action. Each of these characteristics makes it easy for me to declare that, thus far, Near Perfect is my favorite read of 2001. It's the kind of story where you wish you did know the characters, not just the men, but the women too. These people are smart, upwardly mobile, sassy, go-getters, and they're human, prone to err, yet lovable.  It's a feel good novel, one that makes you regret you've come to the story's end, but glad you were fortunate to read such a wonderful novel in the first place.  It's highly recommended.	2001-10-27

I'd have to say that out of all the books I've read in 2001, only two fall into the category of stories that were so unusual they were unlike anything I've ever read. The first book that fits into that category is The Absence of Nectar, and the other is Child of God.<br />To me this was a book in which the writer didn't follow prescribed rules of how characters should be portrayed. It seems (and I could be wrong) that she just went for it, let herself feel everything the characters felt, and allowed herself to tell this story no matter how strange it was, or how wretched the characters' behaviour.<br />It is very difficult to give a synopsis of this story but I will say it is an examination of a family's history and the tragedies they endured, the pitfalls of generational curses, the horrors of voodoo, and other such unusual elements.<br />If you enjoy a story that includes atrocity after atrocity, with unforgettable and at times, EVIL characters, you may want to read Child of God. While I wouldn't call it literary fiction, I think a better term is comm-lit (commercial literary) because it combines the two elements and does so successfully.	2001-10-21

We got to travel from New York to Atlanta to Chicago and that gave the story a sense of adventure.<br />· Nick, the main character, wasn't afraid to express his heartfelt emotions for Jasmine. It is very unusual to see young adult male characters behave in this manner and it was refreshing to see that.<br />· I enjoyed the insight the writer gave through Nick's interest in the acting field. It's always good to provide some details about a characters interests or occupation to get a better glimpse inside his personality.<br />What could have been better:<br />· Weak dialogue (I was looking for conversations that were fresh, sparkly, and unique but most of the dialogue between the men and women was something we've all heard before).<br />· Too many incidents of things happening that add nothing to the plot (I was looking for action, intensity, or conflict that made me want to know what happened next. There was a lot of description that could have been eliminated that would help to improve the story's pacing).<br />· Starting off sentences with adverbs is a no-no (Romantically, he _____. (It's probably better to use metaphors or similes instead of lots of adverbs).<br />· Character development could have been stronger (In spite of what they went through, I felt nothing for these people. I didn't hate them, didn't like them, there just wasn't any emotional pull that made me care about their lives).<br />· Too much telling, virtually no showing. (Most writers have heard the rule about show and don't tell. Show through dialogue not description. If a character was upset, show me through their actions or dialogue, not through the writer giving long explanations of how they felt).<br />· Scenes that jumped from past to present without warning. (This presents a structural problem and may result in the reader becoming confused).<br />Overall, the story has great potential and with greater storytelling ability, this book could have received a 4 or a 5 rating.through their actions or dialogue, not through the writer giving long explanations of how they felt).<BR>· Scenes that jumped from past to present without warning.

Personally, I thought he did a fine job in telling a complex story, especially since he isn't taking it from his own life, but is actually making it up, becoming the characters, and trying to imagine what it would feel like to be in their shoes. It is bothersome to see how people are dissing this book. If you were to take EJD's name off the cover, would it still be considered so horrible (as a few other readers have indicated)? Why is it that people think just because Eric alters his style a little bit, and writes about something controversial with unlikable characters that his writing is getting worse? I thought his writing was fine. As a matter of fact, Eric's &quot;worst&quot; could be considered another writer's &quot;best&quot;, but that's another matter. Think about it! This is his sixth book. If he keeps redoing Cheaters &amp; Friends and Lovers, people will complain that he's formulaic. Yet if he takes a risk, which all serious writers have to do at some point, some of the readers don't like it and wish he'd go back to the style that he's already mastered. If you want the true formulaic type writer, go read a Danielle Steele novel, but if you are willing to hang with someone who seems to enjoy stretching artistically and challenging himself, than stick with Eric Jerome Dickey and allow him the space to create unusual stories and at the same time cultivate his craft.	2001-08-24

In this sequel, Sandy is struggling to resume living a life she hadn't ever imagined, one that doesn't include her husband Adrian who died from AIDS. Even though he's gone, so many things still remind her of Adrian, especially her brother-in-law Winston, who greatly favors his brother, and who is there to give Sandy support whenever she needs it.  As difficult as it is, life tends to spring forth once she meets a man named Randall, a strong man, but one who requires certain elements if he is to be in a relationship.  It is through the trials and tribulations of every day things that will prove whether or not Sandy can regain her strength to move forward, or if she will remain flawed by her past and be robbed of all life has to offer.<br />In addition to seeing how Sandy fares, we're privileged to witness the journeys of Britney a mother and wife, who realizes that she's blessed and is not afraid to acknowledge that, Janice, a woman who seems to have made strides but who must cope and overcome setbacks, and Martha, a lady who battles demons in the only ways she knows how.<br />As with all her previous works, Margaret Johnson-Hodge has once again penned a story that delves deep beneath the surface of relationships. In this novel, MJH gets down and dirty, from telling the wondrous things of life, to revealing those shocking and unexpected incidents that make us cringe as we realize everyone goes through troubles and must seek to find deliverance. The writer has done an excellent job in bringing forth this sequel, unmasking numerous emotions, showing the strength and downfall of the human spirit, and still providing hope by the story's end. Bravo, Margaret. I'm ready for the next one!	2001-08-19

A man and woman openly and willingly divvy up the lips, bed, mind, and soul of another woman and they believe that this arrangement is doable, acceptable, and something that they're willing to endure because of their love for that one woman and her love for them. The center of this emotionally fascinating, yet disturbing relationship is Nicole, a woman who loves deep, loves hard, and if she has things her way, the two people to whom she wants to give all her love are a nameless male writer from Los Angeles, and an aggressive woman named Ayanna.  The man is actually Nicole's former fianc and Ayanna is the individual whose existence caused Nicole to change her mind about marrying him. <br><br>I really enjoyed this book for a number of reasons. For one, the story was written from one person's point-of-view, which is a different read for me from Eric Dickey. However, the writing wa!s detailed and thorough enough so that you're given a complete picture regarding the characters: the writer, Nicole, Ayanna, and especially Nicole's deeply religious mother, and the writer's father, a civil rights activist.<br><br>I also really liked the fact that the main characters have living parents. Sometimes their presence helps the reader to understand the main characters a little better. The novel is structurally sound: no noticeable gaps, great intensity, everything was done very well. I enjoyed the setting (Oakland) and the vivid writing makes you feel as if you're walking alongside the characters.<br><br>One other thing I was happy about is the word orchestration/combination of long and short sentences (as opposed to a lot of short sentences). To me this gives the novel more of a lyrical or poetic feel and I loved that aspect.<br><br>I truly believe the readers will enjoy Between Lovers once they settle down and begin to read...it is the type of story that takes you! to another place and that's what novels are supposed to do. <br><br>On the constructive side: the writer might want to watch those spellings of celebrity names...(Atlantic Starr). Sometimes those misspelled words stand out like a cop car sitting in front of your house. :)<br><br>In summary, I love that Eric's writing is evolving & going to an even higher level, and Between Lovers is wonderful evidence of that growth.	2001-06-25

With Forever, Timmothy B. McCann has penned an ambitious, tightly written, romantic, realistic, and highly recommended story about the rigors of relationships and what it takes to make them successful.<br />Financial analyst Drew Staley and lawyer Betty Robinson vow to share their lives forever at their wedding.  But McCann shows how easy it is to say one thing, and how tough it is to do another when factors are thrown into a relationship that you hadn't predicted. From familial pressures, to work stresses, the Staley couple is forced to endure trial after trial (no pun intended).  Their love for one another is questioned each step of their marital journey.  Not only does Evander (Betty's one time lover) return to throw confusion into the mix, but Drew develops a personal problem that threatens Betty's security.  In addition, the minor characters of Jacqui and Stefan are just as intriguing, but the one to look out for is Blue.  His mouth is filled with wisdom that will leap off the pages and right into your own heart and mind.  All the characters are richly drawn, and McCann does a fantastic job with his descriptions which are detailed enough to allow the reader to envision the story's sense of place, and to experience the vast array of character emotions.<br />Using humor, social commentary, and some of the most romantic scenarios one could ever hope for, the writer has really upped the ante in Forever, a novel that won't be soon forgotten.	2001-04-21

The writing style allows you to dig deep beneath the surface and we are priviledged to know Ruth inside out.  What you get is a graphic yet sensitive story that includes humor, romance, disappointment, and so many other emotions.<br />Each character was well fleshed out (from the annoying Eric - the abuser, to her girlfriend and staunch supporter Bernie).  The writer shows that the life of an abused woman includes how she interacts with those around her, and JD did a great job.<br />The only thing missing from this book is &quot;a sense of place&quot;. It would have been great to have more description of the settings so you can get a vision of where the people are at all times (e.g., room description, furniture, weather).  This helps to draw the reader even more into a scene and would have been a nice added touch.<br />Overall, the book is a wonderful read, a departure from the norm and is highly recommended.	2001-04-02

The biggest stand out in this piece is the character's voice (she reminded me of Inda in Sister, Sister).  This teenaged girl is pregnant and concerned about her condition and why her boyfriend doesn't treat her right.  EJD wrote with such conviction that you feel he is the character; through the effectiveness of his portrayl, you know this girl's mind, you can feel what she's feeling as she struggles with her emtoions and psychological challenges and for that alone, he must be commended.

His daughter seemingly does not like her father, doesn't really know him, yet she visits him frequently perhaps to bring some closure to their painful relationship. As a child she endured beatings, humiliations, and other equally tragic events all at the hands of Hy-Lo, her drunken father. Kenzie and her younger brother are forced to observe how Hy-Lo abuses his wife, a woman who seems bound to him not just in name but other inexplicable and invisible reasons.<br />This was my first Bernice McFadden read and I enjoyed the lyricism and imagery of her writing.  McFadden takes an abundance of words to draw, paint, shape, and sketch her characters.  Her technique and skill allows the reader to delve deep within the story and  feel their sorrow, share their pain.  Also there are a lot of characters in this story and some stand out (e.g. Priscilla) and refuse to leave your mind long after the story has ended.<br />The story's timeframe jumped from past to present without warning and I'll admit this did result in a little confusion on my part.  But nevertheless, the story is tightly written, impressive, and may give one a few things to think about - family, pain, misunderstanding, the price of forgiveness, and the struggle of redemption.<br />Cydney Rax	2001-03-08

It's not that Ben doesn't love his wife, Helen, and his daughter, Makeba. It's just that he feels such a struggle to be everything his wife expects him to be, and is torn between her expectations and those of his own.  Ben yearns to write; writing is in his soul, his heart, but Helen doesn't seem to understand and ridicules Ben about his dreams.  With mounting bills and pressures from his odd-acting mother-in-law, Ben feels inadequate, restless, and needs space from his family. Years later, after Ben's dreams of becoming a writer materialize, he is confronted by the daughter he abandoned at one of his book signings and is forced to come to terms with his manhood.<br />The story weaves you through a lyrical wonderment; a fascinating tale of a daughter's quest to make sense of her father's questionable decisions, and a story of a father's desire to reconnect with his child.

They're also guys who talk plenty of noise about each other's business (like who the other is dating), and the guys are always eager to give their very graphic and impassioned viewpoints on the male/female relationship scene.<br />This book will keep you in stitches because there is page after page of hilarious lines and scenes.  And although each character stands on his own, the amazingly arrogant and mouthy Ibn may garner the most attention; Ibn is a \\"character\\" in the true sense of the word who says and does some of the most outlandish things I've seen yet in print.  The story is fast paced, filled with action, sex, romance, drama, and quite a few shockers.  Simply put, fans of \\"Good Peoples\\" should find another winner in the unforgettable \\"Four Guys and Trouble\\".	2001-01-16

The writing is simple, very detailed but in a good kind of way, and it feels so 'right now' even though the setting of the story takes place in the mid-90's.  Everything about it is appealing, from the wide range of characters (lots of kids, adults, and some seniors), to the moving way the writer takes you inside the lives of these people. By the time you finish reading, you may feel like these people actually exist, and in a way I guess they really do. An excellent and highly recommended read.	2001-01-08

You will be moved by the vibrancy of the characters, especially the teenaged daughter Zadi whose voice springs from the pages of this unforgettable debut. If you're into comparisons, think Terry McMillan combined with Patty Rice and you've got yourself an engaging and realistic read that chronicles the complex lives of contemporary African American women.	2000-12-27

Lynn Harris does a marvelous job with Money Can't Buy Me Love. As usual, his writing is sensitive, funny, engaging, and shocking. Harris always delves into areas that might not be common knowledge as far as non-heterosexual relationships, yet the required emotional bond is there: pain, love, fear, and hope, so readers should be able to identify with this moving and memorable story; one that made me sad to see it end.<br />Marcus Major heaps more of his hilarious writing with Kenya and Amir. He has a fine flair for male/female relationship issues and tackles them with much humor and sophistication. Major's writing gets better and better, and if you enjoyed Good Peoples, you should also love this novella.<br />In Cafe Piel, Eric Dickey throws us a curve. What? No L.A. streets and freeways? Not exactly. This time he shows us that love and longing can happen even in the most foreign places (Mexico).  The story includes some mad drama, and as a warning, you'd better brush up on your Spanish because the love connection here takes place between a brother and a woman whose English ain't so great, but her ability to captivate the main character, Bobby Davis, is what counts the most, so it seems.<br />Colin Channer is like a word master. His words took me places I've never been before. His writing is thoughtful and detailed, and his story is a like a ride through the park on a leisurely Sunday afternoon.<br />All in all the stories were wonderfully written, a must have for any collector of African-American stories at its grandest.	2000-12-10

A good celebrity autobio will have plenty of pertinent details: family background, how they became successful, little known secets, name dropping, &amp; cherished memories.  In this book, Natalie provides humorous and sensitive detail: things that will make you laugh out loud (all the many times she was saved from tragedy via angels), things that will shock you (her darkened drug addicted days), and things that will make you think (she had a male friend who was on the brink of death, only to miraculously recover; but when he refused to acknowledge that God had healed him, the man up and died -- just like that.)<br />I loved Natalie's candidness and her words of wisdom that she  inserts in her book. She admits that everything in her life isn't perfect -- she's still learning and I admire that.<br />I believe anyone who reads this book will come away with a greater insight into the life of a famous singer, and you'll also be more aware of the angels that may be present in your own life.  I loved this book and highly recommend it.	2000-11-06

For various reasons and motives, each man decides to dial the  1-900-BLACK-LUV dating line and come across a throng of women who are  either outright wrong for them, or who seem to be a promising fit. Lookin'  for Luv is a fast-paced story that's sprinkled with hilarious lines and a  few shocking surprises. A lot of the characters seem to be 'crazy' as they  do and say some outrageous things. On the other hand, your heart may be  moved as you read about some of the struggles men go through in their quest  for the right relationship.<br />One distraction to the story is the writer's  frequent habit of telling the reader things that are obvious. I think it's  better to let the reader guess what is happening instead of having the  author reveal it. Other than that, this debut novel was excellent and  should be enjoyed by readers of humorous African-American romance stories.	2000-09-03

Lynn Harris book and I was thoroughly impressed with &quot;Not a Day Goes By&quot;, a story about John Basil Henderson and his bride-to-be Yancey Harrington Braxon.  They both have  secrets that threaten to destroy their impending union and E. Lynn keeps  you gripped to your seat as you're taken from one dramatic scene to another  on the couple's quest to reach the altar.<br />The plot was tighter than  tight and remained on focus throughout the book.  This means that every  scene and every character added something and was built upon the central  theme of the story.  Because the plot was so tight, you must give a nod to  his editor because only good editing can make a book read as well as  &quot;Not a Day Goes By.&quot;<br />From the drama surrounding Basil and his  past, to the antics of Yauncey and her unforgettable mother, Ava, E. Lynn's  characterizations are strong and noteworthy.  They are realistic characters  and you are allowed to feel their every mood.  I actually noticed when I  was laughing and/or shedding tears (a rarity for me) during the most  hilarious and sensitive scenes.<br />This book is the epitome of a page  turning novel. The outstanding writing, awesome plot twists, memorable  characters, and laugh really loud dialogue should make &quot;Not a Day Goes  By&quot; one of the most commendable novels of the year.	2000-07-24

Due to some equal opportunity fibbing, at first  things between Vince and Dana start out a little shaky.  Once they get over  their initial reservations, their love connection looks more promising.  It's only when Vince and Dana decide they want to jump the broom that their  commitment is tested and the couple are forced to deal with the  consequences of holding back vital information from each other about their  past romances.<br />Likes:  What I loved most about this story is the  eloquent and emotional prose; especially when it came to Vince's feelings  about his concern for Kwanzaa, his five-year old daughter; a daughter whom  he hasn't laid eyes on in years. Midway during LG, Vince goes through quite  a few changes that, unfortunately, makes one think he doesn't have the most  upright character on earth.  Yet I admired how the writer showed Vince's  frustration regarding how much control his ex-wife wanted to exert when it  came to his participation in Kwanzaa's life. I admired the depth of  emotions Vince portrayed concerning that situation.<br />Other:  I was  somewhat surprised at the amount of narrative the writer used in certain  beginning passages.  In my opinion, one of his greatest strengths is  dialogue and I enjoy the flow that is provided when things are in that  conversational zone.  Also there are quite a few characters in this story  and I had a helluva time keeping up with who was who and what role they  played in LG.  Then, to be honest, although there were many references made  to Vince and Dana, the writer could have dug deeper to show multiple layers  to their relationship: for people who claimed to love each other, their  relationship seemed a little superficial.  For e.g., he could have shown  various struggles between them that brought out more positive results  (trust, loyalty, endurance, etc.)<br />In summary, I know in my heart LG isn't  the writer's best work, but it is still worthwhile.  And, in contrast to  some of the other reader comments, I thought the story ended well and I had  no problem with it.loyalty, endurance, etc.)<br />In summary, I know in my heart LG isn't  the writer's best work, but it is still worthwhile.

There aren't too many  stories these days about a man who is trying to adjust to a new life after  having been imprisoned.  I thought that Isaac's thought processes towards  his release, and the references regarding the political climate in the  inner city were interesting and well detailed.  Also, the story takes place  in the Detroit area and I truly enjoyed reading about those local spots  that I used to know years ago.  Another good thing is Ms. McMillan is  surprisingly funny in a subtle kind of way. I enjoy her sense of humor a  lot.<br />DISLIKES:  While reading the story I didn't feel any tension; it  didn't seem like the story was building to any climax.  Also, it would have  read better if there was more dialogue as opposed to narrative.  Other than  that, I liked the book.  And in spite of what some folks think, I believe  that Rosalyn McMillan is a true writer with a lot to say.	2000-07-15

It's like destiny is trying to get your attention to let you know that if these fine writers  have struggled and made it, so can others.  As a person who also loves to  read I enjoyed being fed by numerous inspirational stories that show the  sorrows, joys, and emotional rollercoaster of being a writer.  I enjoyed  the Terry McMillan story entitled, &quot;Why I Write&quot; because it shows  she is sincere about what she does and about getting inside her characters  heads and hearts so she can gain understanding.  I also was enthralled with  Bud Gardner's &quot;A Chat With Alex Haley&quot;.  The fact that Gardner  had the courage to write such a legend and to ask him to speak at a  writer's conference is one thing; to have Mr. Haley respond affirmatively  just to turn around and do something totally unexpected, scary yet  delightful, says a lot about how much a writer's life can be filled with  surprises.  I really am grateful such a book exists; it's empowering to  know others share your feelings about your dreams.  I would encourage all  inspiring and professional writers to pick up a copy of this book. I  believe you will notice immediately the difference that this book will make  in your life.	2000-06-30

Gabrielle was young, beautiful,somewhat innocent, who wanted a job but had a secret that might stop her from getting that job. I believe the writer did a fine job causing the reader to sympathize with this character who was beautiful but had fears and insecurities like everyone else. I enjoyed reading about Gabrielle's nemesis named Stephanie, definitely the most outrageous and interesting character in the book.  None of the romances thrilled me...  I felt like I was reading a Jackie Collins novel, which is not a bad thing, but I didn't feel like this was a story that I could relate to because it seemed like I was watching events unfold for the sake of entertainment.  I guess I'm used to reading books that mostly give you the opportunity to connect with the characters because you've been thru what they're going thru.  In &quot;Reading Between The Lies&quot; it was liking watching people do things whose path I'd never cross.  I did enjoy reading about how illiteracy affects those who suffer from it.

Rodney begins to reflect on his life and wonder if any of his past lovers could be his future mate. In my opinion, the  writer didn't really stick to the main focus of the book; it seemed there  was a lot of emphasis on Rodney's career, and inclusion of tons of  characters who didn'dt seem to belong in this story.<br />On one hand I  enjoyed reading about Rodney's observations regarding LA, the entertainment  industry, and his female love interests. On the other hand, I truly wished  there could have been less narrative and more dialogue in this otherwise  well written story.  The good thing is there are quite a few laugh out loud  sentences in this book and you do learn a lot about commercial shoots, etc.  Even though this isn't my favorite Nelson George book, I do enjoy his  other works and look forward to reading more fiction by him.	2000-06-03

It's unfortunate that this unauthorized biography is &quot;unauthorized&quot; because I feel that if the Diane Patrick had the  benefit of Terry's participation, it could have been a more valuable and  relevant piece.  Some of the 'facts' were interesting to me as far as the  deals Terry got and how many books she sold, but I don't think the average  reader would care (especially if you're not interested in becoming a  writer).  Nevertheless, I was somewhat satisfied because I enjoy what you'd  call 'rags to riches' stories, not that she was ever in rags, but I like to  know how successful people have 'made it'.  I also enjoyed the frequent  references to Terry's ambition and determination in promoting her debut  novel, &quot;Mama&quot;.  In short, if you don't get a chance to read this  book, you really haven't missed anything.

I'm aware that it's much easier to write a review than it is to write a page-turning book, therefore let me first commend Mr. Tyree for all  his efforts in pursuing his writing dreams.  However, in reading the first  couple hundred pages of Sweet St. Louis, I couldn't help but notice certain  habits he has in regards to his writing style.  For example, he is  notorious for explaning things that the reader automatically knows.  Mr.  Tyree will write a sentence like &quot;Well, when did she get  pregnant?&quot; she asked, for more information on the story.&quot;  It is  not necessary to explain the character's every thought or the reasoning  behind what he or she says.  Frequently writing in that method slows the  story's pace, makes one tempted to reshelve the book, and those type of  sentences rarely add anything worthwhile to the story.  If Mr. Tyree and  his editor would remove all those redundant sentences during the rewrite,  his stories would read so much better.  He has great storylines, wonderful  titles, but the writing style currently used isn't getting better but stays  stagnant with each release.  I enjoy some of his sentences, but I am  looking forward to the day that he understands what makes a story flow and  begins to utilize that knowledge so that the reader will have a more  enjoyable experience.  Wishing him much literary success.	2000-05-05

Male/female troubles, chummy sister-friends, and childhood demons seem to  be the common ground that many authors seem to tread.  One of the items  that makes &quot;Somethin' Extra&quot; stand out is the academic background  of the two main characters: David Lewis is a 50ish professor of English and  Genie Gatlin is a 20-something caterer/secretary who works in his  department.  David's marital woes and Genie's romantic farces create the  road on which they first meet.  The author uses humorous dialogue,  flashbacks, mental musings, and sophisticated descriptions to tell her  story. I liked how well the author characterized David, making him a  convincing married man who worries about aging and maintaining a  relationship with his sons.  It was also refreshing to see David admit that  even though all isn't perfect in his marriage, he still has feelings for  his wife.  And Genie is a true character.  Boy does she eat a lot (there  are a ton of eating scenes in this book - don't ask me why I noticed).  Genie seems strong yet vulnerable, outspoken, yet afraid.  Even still she's  genuine, touchable, a woman with whom many readers should be able to  identify.  If there were any criticisms, I would have loved to read more  action, drama, or tension between the husband and wife or Genie and the  wife.  With extramarital affairs an issue, this novel is ripe for constant  bickering and knockdown drags out.  Nevertheless the story is enjoyable,  funny, and includes a couple of nice surprises to keep the reader on edge.  An overall, wonderful first effort.	2000-04-26

I've read interracial storylines before, but had reservations when it came to reading  one written by a man.  However, once I began to read, I was more impressed  by the writer's skills, creativity, and hard work and didn't focus so much  on the storyline.  MIMC is full of what I call classic EJDisms (all the  techniques for which he's known): metaphors, side-splitting  'run-to-the-bathroom' humor, strong characterization, plot twists, great  attention to detail, and tension).  The characters Kim, Jordan, J'Nette and  Solomon were fleshed out very well. You could close your eyes and envision  them.  MIMC also had plenty of surprises and the writer PUT you THERE in  the scene.  He does have a great way of showing and doesn't merely tell.  Those are the good things.  The only distraction is probably the part where  a trip is taken to Memphis. I found myself wanting to skip over that  particular section because I was more into what would happen between Jordan  and Kimberly.

What is wonderful about this  story is the writer puts you there.  You can see Mya and feel her every  emotion, every step of the way whether painful or joyous.  I love the  writing, the subplots that involves suspenseful family issues (separations,  babies born out of wedlock, and tortoruos violence).  This story covers the  gamut and the writer did a superb job.  I love her word orchestration  (reminds me of EJD somewhat) and I look forward to reading more books  (Butterscotch Blues) by Margaret Johnson-Hodge.	2000-03-12

Using the story of Cinderella as a backdrop, Serita Jakes shares personal dilemmas and  triumphs (becoming injured in a car accident and learning how to walk  again, and in her younger days suffering from the woes of picking the wrong  relationship.  My favorite part is when she writes letters to the Secret  Keeper experessing her very innermost feeling.  She has a wonderful style  of writing, serene and full of wisdom.  This is a great book for women to  read and is highly recommended.	2000-03-08

The  story takes you all over Houston, the state of Texas, Louisiana, and even  that infamous Cancun, Mexico.  Tony basically gives you account of his  encounters with girlfriends, wanna be girlfriends, girls who want to go  from &quot;temp to perm&quot;, etc.  Troy Martin has a real grasp on what  men really think about women whether we want to hear it or not.  Some of  the language is -- strong to say the least -- but Troy does a great job  telling it like it is.  His writing reminds me of Michael Baisden and Omar  Tyree.  He's very funny, VERY funny, and will have you laughing out loud  with some of his descriptions.  I felt he did an overall great job with his  first novel.  The only reason the book did not get five stars is because  there were a lot of editing mishaps in the book, and I was hoping to read a  little more action or dialogue between the characters instead of all the  'telling' that the author does.  Nevertheless, &quot;Dazed and  Confused&quot; comes highly recommended.  It's an interesting, fast-paced  story that will give you something to think, cringe, and laugh about.	2000-03-06
US	50822047	RQ11LL379Q3IX	0525945350	378168929	Good Peoples	Books	5	17	17	N	N	Impressive debut	&quot;Good Peoples&quot; by Marcus Major is an impressive debut.  The story includes all the ingredients of a great read: romance, humor, insight, vivid and memorable characters, and strong writing.  The main  character Myles is a schoolteacher who's been unlucky in love; that is,  until he meets the sultry Marisa who promptly knocks him off his feet.  You  will enjoy how the writer develops the relationship between Myles and  Marisa, the ups and downs of their relationship, and you'll be trembling  near the end as you wait to see if their love can withstand certain issues.  There's some laugh out loud scenes in the book, some endearing moments  with Myles, and some interesting observations from the outspoken brother  Amir.  Don't want to tell it all, just want to say it is a good book, and  is highly recommended.	2000-02-29
US	50822047	R2WW0IHLB3PUTH	1573220639	202727782	Soul Kiss	Books	5	8	9	N	N	One of the Most Enjoyable Books I've Read	I was looking for a story to read that would have a young girl as the main character; I also wanted to read such a book in first person.  That's how I found &quot;Soul Kiss&quot;.  After reading reviews I purchased the book  last fall and just finished it in January.  I found &quot;Soul Kiss&quot;  to be immensely satisfying. It's the story of Mariah who is sent to live  with her two elderly aunts; her mom drops her off and Mariah begans to wish  to be reunited with her mother in the worst way.  She carries these  yearnings for many years and has various adventures as she reflects on the  events which happen in her life.  The writer Shay Youngblood has a style I  wish I could call my own.  I adored the imagery she used; the descriptions  of some Mariah's thoughts about how much she yearns for her mothers  (&quot;I miss my mama, but I don't want to.  I am seven years old and  yesterday is today, tomorrow never comes.&quot;)  It was just a pleasant  and poetic type of fiction; the kind I've love to be able to read all the  time.  I love the book and I hope you will get a copy, read it and enjoy it  too. It's that good.	2000-02-06
US	50822047	RLIN81U1K62LJ	0671025368	758176148	The Coldest Winter Ever	Books	5	96	102	N	N	Riveting, Thoroughly Entertaining w/Strong Characterization	The Coldest Winter Ever by Sister Souljah is a thoroughly engrossing, simply riveting book that I am very happy to have read.  It is like a  tell-all story from an urban teenaged girl's point-of-view. From the drug  life to the privileged life, the story takes you on a journey that you will  never forget.  There's so much that can be said about this book, but I'll  start with the main character Winter.  This girl is sooo real, so authentic  that I wondered &quot;Who is Winter? Where is she?&quot;  SHE EXISTS out  there somewhere.  Sister Souljah did an excellent job characterizing Winter  as well as the others (Midnight, Lauren, Santiaga, etc.). The way the story  was written you were allowed to know Winter's every thought, whether you  agreed with those thoughts or not. Winter was defined by what happened to  her and how she reacted to the things that she experienced (mother's  accident, father's jailing, being forced to live among strangers, lack of  money, love for money...). And the plot had many twists and turns, shockers  and laughs.  My favorite line is &quot;Bounce, nigga,&quot; which is what  Winter said to a 'white man'. It was hilarious. Overall, I loved the story,  the writing, the character, and some of the messages conveyed in this piece  of work.  It is highly recommended...a book that has &quot;FILM ME&quot;  written all through its pages.	2000-02-03
US	50822047	RD30UZ8V7NNRR	0671884298	858707005	A Little Yellow Dog: An Easy Rawlins Mystery	Books	4	6	6	N	N	I'm Hooked On Easy	A Little Yellow Dog was the first Walter Mosley book I've ever read, and the first mystery I've read written by an African-American.  From page one, I was hooked.  It wasn't so much that the book was a Mystery, per se, but  it was the writing style of Mosley that charmed me.  I now see what people  are referring to when they compliment Mosley's talent:  he's quick witted,  intelligent, detailed but doesn't over do it, puts you in the room, on the  street, in the car, whereever the characters are, Mosley puts you there  with them.  He has the funniest expressions, just short little simple  sentences that are profound and delightful.  Since then, I have purchased a  couple more books of his and look forward to enjoying them as well.  I  highly recommend Walter Mosley mysteries to people who just like good  writing, lots of fast moving scenes, and thought-provoking, emotional, and  funny, witty lines.	2000-01-19

I found this book to be full of surprises because I assumed it would be full of Rule No. 1, Rule No. 2  stuff, but it was much more than that.  The main character Madison Maguire  was a real handful.  She had attitude to spare.  Seemed she had a lot of  issues, but in the end, and through the adversities she experienced,  everything pulled together to give Madison some much needed character.  It  was great to see how the character Chris stuck by her and SHOWED her what  love was, as opposed to simply TELLING her &quot;Baby, I love you&quot; but  not doing anything to back it up.  I really got into the story after  Chapter 10 (not that the other chapters weren't good), but I felt the meat  of the story was introduced at that moment.  I recommend this book to any  Sheneska Jackson readers and I look forward to more writings by this very  talented and 'going places' woman, Ms. Jackson.	2000-01-18

Have you ever had someone call your house, they had the wrong  number, but you were intrigued because that person's voice on the other end  of the line SOUNDED SOOO GOOD?  Well, the power and magnetism, teasing, and  camraderie between Davida and Marc ended up being a fabulous love  connection.  After realizing he had the wrong person, Marc loved Davida's  voice and personality so much that he kept calling back.  They developed a  phone relationship and, of course, met in person and the sparks continued  to fly.  Davida is the widowed mom to eight-year-old Destiny who throws in  enough &quot;Will you be my daddy lines&quot; at Marcus to tug at the  reader's heart.  I enjoyed this story and was somewhat surprised, but yet  delighted, at the final conclusion.  Good job, Ms. McFarland.	2000-01-10
US	50822047	R24FS272LFO5QO	1575664895	824287693	Casting The First Stone	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Lots of Drama	To me Casting The First Stone is a story that covers many aspects of marriage, choices, actions, and consequences.  The pastor of a prominent church has a wife and adoring daughter but it doesn't appear to be enough  as he makes one reckless decision after enough that affects his life and  his ministry.  At times I found myself laughing at some of the drama that  unfolded, but I must say by the time I read the last paragraph, I honestly  felt sadness in my heart for the pastor.  What happened to the Black family  isn't anything I'd wish on anybody.  They went thru much hell.  I don't  want to give the ending away but I think it's worth it for people to read,  enjoy and maybe learn something from this story.	1999-12-29

When the book first came out, well, I knew I wasn't buying it because I am not an Aretha Franklin fan, but I do enjoy reading celebrity memoirs or authorized (and even  unauthorized) biographies.  So this weekend, I was in the library and this  was about the only halfway interesting book that I could check out.  Believe me, YOU DO NOT WANT TO BUY THIS LIGHTWEIGHT GARBAGE.  OH, JESUS!  All I got from the book is that she hates for people to talk against her in  the press, yet she's talking about them in her book.  She seems to be stuck  on herself, (CONCEITED and gives herself so much credit for stuff no one is  even thinking about), seems like she's trying to defend her past actions,  she even trips me out when she says Whitney Houston and Lauryn Hill are  welcome to come to her for advice?  Why would they?  She does not reveal  the fathers of her children (and interestingly enough there aren't any  pictures of her kids who she is so proud of - unless you count the one with  one of her babies whose face you can't even see).  Anyway, I somewhat  enjoyed the references to Detroit because I lived there as a child, but  other than that, this book makes you sick.  Oh, it's going back to the  library TODAY!	1999-11-22

Being a big fan of Terry McMillan I thought I'd buy it and put it on my bookshelf.  See, I'd actually read the book via the local library when it  first came out and to be honest, I wasn't feeling it.  Yes, admittedly it  was those overrun sentences, etc.  But this time around, I LOVED IT!  I had  to realize the book was written based on the character's thought pattern.  Stella was cool.  Neurotic, but interesting nonetheless.  And so, this time  around, I consider it one of my favorites novels.  I just don't understand  all the Terry McMillan bashing that's going on like she's a terrible writer  to be compared with, she can't write, yada, yada, yada.  What gives?  Give  her a break.  Her success, her style has opened up the Africian-American  literary world to COUNTLESS (well, maybe you can count them) new and  emerging Af-Am writers.  We won't name them, but they know who they are.  LOL!  I'm saying all this to say, don't give up McMillan; she has a lot  more to say (fingers crossed).  And, yes, KEEP WRITING BOOKS PLEASE.  Thank  you very much!	1999-11-22
