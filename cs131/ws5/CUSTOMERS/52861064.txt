Well, Gordianus continues to be entirely implausible as far as actual Late Republican Rome was concerned. But then this novel manages to obtain an eerie athmosphere, as Gordianus enters old age in earnest in a setting of civil war, chaos and impending doom, the telling of the story revolves around a savvy counterpoint structure, and the mystery is actually satisfactory and not a pretext for displaying historical erudition. I look foward to reading the next novel - something \\"Last seem in Massilia\\" didn't quite manage to do.	2005-10-11

However, the fine drawing and the speculative detail about reconstrued ecology and behavior made the book a light read, even comic at times, when you discover that sabertoothed cats were a kind of lions and tigers \\"on steroids\\", with heavily muscled forelimbs and shoulders allowing them to immobilize the prey to the ground in order to deliver a devastating neck bite that would close a windpipe and sever bloodvessels neatly and quickly. Very funny to think that evolution could have taken this alternative path of turning the gracile feline form into something like a BB contest...	2005-07-28

And of course Deutscher grasps the gist of the matter as Trotsky's \\"middle\\" period is concerned : the fact that he was unable to lauch a decided bid for power aganst Stalin when he had still a chance to do so, but then managed to recover enough influence - almost solely by means of his intellectual acumen - to wage a brilliant but doomed in advance defensive political campaign in the late 1920s. Be as it is, if marxism is going to recover from the long reactionary eclipse of the last 30 years, it will have to pay attention to musch of what Trotsky said and wrote in the period covered by this work.  <br /> <br />Exactly because of that, I've to complain about the quality of this new Verso edition. Typos abound; the cover is good, but the paper used for the regular pages is of low quality - a highly absorbing, and I suppose perhaps of high acidity, variety of paper, something I discovered when my copy was exposed to humidity and became soaked like a sponge. Also, there lacks and introductory essay and a glossary. Frankly, I think Verso should value more having this work in its publishing list.	2005-05-17

It's strange that I simply loved all three parts of the \\"late Zuckermann\\" trilogy, as Roth's opulent, lush prose (of course taken from Proust's, but with Roth's own slant) never fails to entice me. But then it's strange that Balzac, when writing about Restoration France, never fails to expose _all_ sides of a given issue, as all of his characters, even the very minor one, never fail to have the best reasons -according to each one's lights- to think and act in a given manner. The result is that, even when Balzac is writing a very short story, you never fail to discern the movement of a whole society behind the tale. Roth, writing about 1960s USA, cannot rise himself to that degree of proficiency. He remains stranded unto this most American temptation, the drive to moralize, and cannot accept all of his characters as they are, therefore the fact that, when trying to offer 1960s history in a nutshell, as it reflects itself onto the life of a family, he cannot offer but a one-sided picture, that of his main character the likeable and failed Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov,while Levov's antagonists - his wife Dawn, his psycopathic daughter Merry, cannot raise themselves beyond caricature.It's strange that the best part of the trilogy _\\"The Human Stain\\"_, is that where the chief character is the one from which Roth is most removed, as Roth's empathy seems to develop in a detrimental way as far as devopment of the \\"bad\\" characters is concerned. To put it short, Roth somehow failed, but his failure remains, nonethless, an impressive one.	2005-04-29

Firstly, it's necessary to keep in mind that Deustscher was not trying to write a biography of Trotsky- if by that is meant an account of his life for its own sake- nor was he trying to write a history of the Russian Revolution and its leaders as a self-contained account. Deutscher's goals where twofold: to vindicate Trotsky's early opposition against Lenin's conception of the revolutionary party as well as his later opposition to Stalin's policies _in the long run_ and at the same time to acknowledge the necessity of Leninism and Stalinism _in the short run_. However objectionable such a view is today, Deutscher's political dialogue with Trotsky's ghost is superbly argued and documented, and anyone, no matter one's political views, will finish reading this work feeling one knows more about the subject than beforehand. In all the languages this work was translated (and I remember the ruckus produced in Brazil by the 1960s Portuguese trans.) it played havoc with accepted Left commonplaces.  <br /> <br />There are many faults in this new Verso edition: first, its paperback binding is atrocious (after a first read, I have already a couple of loose pages); secondly, there lacks an introduction that sets the work in perspective 50 years after its publication, as well as a glossary of unusual terms for today's conservative age (such as comissar, soviet, etc.) and, perhaps, some short biographies of the smaller characters,with dates of birth and decease, positions held, whereabouts, etc.However, the work can still be enjoyably read on its own, even if you miss some (admittedly small) points.	2005-03-20

What makes great historical events \\"great\\" is the way they are perpetually refought by each suceding generation and are perpetually revaluated in the light of changing perceptions.I knew this would be a liberal-conservative account of the Russian Revolution and I was prepared to accept it as it was. Specially because I read this after reading Richard Pipes' two-volume history and, having to cope with Pipes' throughly rightist viewpoint - his demonologies about evil Bolsheviks craving for raw power- I felt it would be a lighter, less offensive (from a Left viewpoint such as mine, that is) read. Instead, it wasn't.    Figes has a light, interstingly tongue-in-cheek mode of writing that makes his reading all the more easier, only, writing in a post-Cold War setting, and seemingly imbued with the Post-Modern certainity that all \\"great narratives\\" are bunk, he simply fails to take the Russian Revolution very seriously - and that is what makes his history far _less_ readable and _more_ offensive for a Leftist to read, as compared to Pipes, who, being a staunch Cold warrior anti-communist, at least takes the Bolsheviks very seriously, if only as evil geniuses.     Figes, instead, writes with a somewhat flippant attitude, and sometimes seems to be bored to death with the complexities posed by the Russian Revolution, and therefore has a tendence for developing - and indulging in -a taste for the anecdotal, the frivolous, even the downright irrelevant. For me, the epitome of this tendancy of his was his appraisal of Lenin, which at a certain point reads thus (pg.389): \\"Lenin did weight training to build up his muscles. It was all part of the macho culture (the black leather jackets, the militant rethorics, the belief in action and the cult of violence) that was the essence of Bolshevism\\". Sure, Figes is a child of his -ours- postmodernage, an age in which bodybuilders _do_ enter politics as bodybuilders; but then, to treat Lenin as somekind of Schwarzenegger's forerunner is to lack historical perspective, i.e., the yearning to know in which way the past was _different_ from our present (not to speak of the fact that Figes does not offer references in footnotes for this particular vignette).To put it short: what is most ideological in Figes history is his refusal to appear as ideological.    There are many good things about this history, above all Figes' clear, interstingly  - and very British, in the best sense of the word - writing style, but then it's all so \\"contaminated\\" with a postmodern, Foucault-esque lack of awareness of any hierarchy of the various causative factors, that one could say that his is a history intent on ending all histories.	2005-03-08

I became a Roth fan when I read _The Human Stain_ a couple of months ago, and I have no reason to alter my judgment after having read \\"I married a communist\\". Only, I believe that, when Human Stain was High Tragedy through and through, as Roth takes his \\"hero\\"'s Coleman Solk's predicament very seriously, in \\"I married...\\" he tends to treat his anti-hero Ira Ringold's plight, this time, with an almost impreceptible farcical streak, a kind of lack of empathy that makes Roth's alter ego Zuckermann behave somewhat as a moralist aggrieved at the sinful humanity and its illusions. Of course, Ira is the kind of Stalinist windbag stalwart parading as a man of steel but also chasing at high bourgeois females, etc., etc.,that was regretfully far too common during the 1950s (and not only in the US) but then, his illusions (or should I say delusions?) are the delusions of many a leftist in his timeframe, and Roth's/Zuckerman's judgamental stance towards him does little in the way of making himself credible or, above all, understanable - an stance a serious writer should take towards _all_ his characters. Sometimes we have too much of Roth the accomplished aesthete passing judment of Mankind's political follies, and far too little of the narrator who takes as his point of departure Nietzsche's \\"Human, all too Human\\" tag.	2005-02-04

The more I've read and re-read this book, the less Tacitus' politics appeal to me, and I wonder that his antiquarian, narrow idealization of Old Republican Rome as against the realities of his own time  must have made him a superlative bore to his colleagues in the Roman Senate, who must have wondered that, if the Old Republic was so much better, then how the Empire could even begin existing? However, there's his grasp of the art of the psychological portrait, an art in which he excelled, and that made him the first historian of mentalities and ideologies ever, something for which he used his oppulent, crisp prose, something that in my view fares far better than, say, Caesar's dry record of his military campaigns. Therefore, one cannot but surrender to his powers of expression and read his book for the nth. time as we allow ourselves to become, again, and again, fascinated by it.	2005-01-03

Reading previous reviews about this prolix, physical, sensuous novel -Roth struck me as one of the few American writers who can speak about sex by means of allusions only without producing near-porn and neverthless manage to be enourmouly enticing- I'm struck by the inability of some American readers to grasp the novel's main point.  <br /> <br />Coleman Silk, the novel's hero, is on one side, an entirely questionable character - an African American who has decided to make good in Academe by faking himself an alternate life as Jewish; on the other side, he's the prototypical all-American hero - the youngster who has decided to make good solely on his own. It's not his decisions, in themselves, that are \\"bad\\"; it's the _context_ in which they are set that makes makes them to appear as so. Now, this is the stuff of which tragedy, according to Aristotle, was made of: a person like any other making a normal, \\"good\\" - but neverthless flawed-  decision that unfolds consequences that turn entirely for the bad. In order to be understood, Silks needs to be set against his historical milieu - therefore to understand the nature of his tragedy is to understand the nature of the general tragedy of the American Dream - something I fear some of the novel's readers are unwilling to cope with. Those who want to cope with it, however, may be sure they shall have a superb novel in their hands with which they shall not easily able to set aside until they have read it from cover to cover.	2004-11-01

Were I to recommend a novel by Greene on his politics alone, I would recommend _The Quiet American_, or the _Human Factor_. This is a novel apparently very removed from Greene's later concerns- a Pascalian set piece, very akin to various pieces produced by Catholic novelists with a taste from Jansenism during the 1930s and 1940s (viz. the Brazilians Octavio de Faria and Lucio Cardoso) about the futility of Man searching salvation on the strenghth of one's good works and about the paramountacy of God's Grace that can save one in the last minute of one's life. But then there's is something in the feeling of alienation that Greene conveys in this novel that transcends his strictly Catholic concerns - an urge to make sense, to overcome the feeling of general meaningless, that makes his novel enjoyable and worthy of a recommendation for the more \\"general\\" public-  and that perhaps explains the sharp turn made by Greene in the 1950s.	2004-10-12

It's already slightly outdated (the Velociraptors are not feathered)but that was to be expected due the steady pace with which our general paleontological knowledge is advancing. However, I want to lodge a complaint. It has to do with Chapter 4, where the \\"hero\\", the giant Brazilian pterosaur _Ahanguera_ is named _Ornithocheirus_ - a genus name given probably by American and European paleontologists that have been working with fossil material smuggled against Brazilian law from the clay deposits of the Santana formation. Now, considering the fact that Brazilian scientists have been working against all odds, lack of funds, and of personnel, to unearth fossil remains from Santana at the same place they are being ramsacked by smugglers caring little about science and lots about making easy money, wouldn't it be considerate and in the best general interests of paleontology to enhance their work by giving notice to their work by using the fine Amerindian names (_Ahanguera_ being an Indian devil, a name much more evocative than _Ornithocheirus_)they have found for Brazilian pterosaurs? Just asking, Okay?    P.S. A heavy consigniment of smuggled fossils from the Santana formation that was aprehended in Rio de Janeiro in the hands of a German smuggler was finally restored in October 2004 to a new museum palenontological museum in Cear that will exhibit them.	2004-07-08

When one starts reading a Victorian novelist, one prepares before hand to face a certain amount of wooden, heavy-handed moralizing, as every great narrative of the epoch is fraught with the opposition between the calls of pleasure and the calls of duty, between seeking for one's private advantage and sticking to one's role, with the writer making the latter to win overwhelming. This novel is no different, in that it's the dutiful Romola that has the upper hand over her nice and debauched husband Tito Melena in the end. However, the novel being set in late Renaissance Italy- a country  with which George Eliot had an enduring love affair - it captures the atmosphere of the time and place in such a beautiful way that this enormous, throughly reserched historical novel has such a flowing, luxurious style that takes an almost liquid quality, like a fresh, transparent scream flowing along a summer Mediterranean landscape. Also, in the person of Savonarola, Eliot menaged to introduce the figure of the idealist turned evil through his attachment to his call. In short: a gorgeous novel. Loved it!	2004-05-21

Were a Isaac Deutscher to write the book, he would begin by explaining Comintern politics at the time, the need felt by Stalin to compensate for the crushing failure of his politics in Germany by means of some adventure elsewhere, the fantasies harboured among his henchmen about the situation in Brazil, the personality cult fostered around Prestes...Well, absolutely nothing of that is explained in the book, which will now become a film in Brazil directed by a telenovela director from TV Globo.

Firstly, there is his style: a racy, ponderous, even turgid Portuguese, with mamooth paragraphs, repetitions, amassing of details to the verge of boredom. However, when he applies such tricks to the depiction of an actual event, specially in a concrete historico-political setting, boredom becomes opulence, as in the case of his two &quot;middle&quot; novels, Baltasar &amp; Blimunda (or _Memorial do Convento_) and this _The year of the death of Ricardo Reis_. When he decides to play philosopher and become &quot;profound&quot;, however, as in his later books, then lushiness becomes simply boredom. I cannot but speak for myself and say that I never managed to finish anything he wrote after _Story of the siege of Lisbon_ . Therefore, if you've already read _Baltasar and Blimunda_, enjoy this book; if this is the first novel by Saramago you've read and you want more like that, read _Baltasar and Blimunda_.

However, since he died in 1580, just when Spain absorbed Portugal into the Iberian Union, his poem in praise of the Portuguese exploits in India was not to be Englishened when the English where busy trying to undone what he had praised. Therefore he lost his chance with the English language. As it is, all English translation of Camoens have been at best exercises in creative anachronism (such as Richard Francis Burton's Victorian one) or simply inadequate (such as the Penguin trans., which is _in prose_!). Also, there is the problem that a translation of the high degree required is best achieved between cognate languages (such as the German trans. of Shakespeare, or the Portuguese trans. of the D.Quixote).

When one is about to take the big plunge and give oneself the trouble of making what is always -in our age of lighter reading, of course - the strenuous effort of reading a XIXth. Century novelist, one - at least me - must make the following question: What was this author's particular attitude, as a man (or woman) of the most bourgeois of all centuries, towards his/her preceding century, the most aristocratic and un-bourgeois XVIIIth. Century? If s/he scorns the XVIIIth. Century, or is indifferent to it, it's quite likely that the author in question is a bourgeois philistine regarding Victorian times as the undisputed acme of human civilization. If s/he is an admirer, than s/he is obviously starting out of a clear sense of alienation from his/her own society, and one should expect at least for this XIXth. Century _avis rara_, genuine sense of humor. Thackeray was one of such Victorians who realized the philisteism of his own society;Ea de Queiroz, his Portuguese disciple (who seems to have learned a lot from reading him) was another. Therefore: Read this book, QED.	2003-06-02

This is the run-of-the-mill booktype on Ancient History that the English speaking academia produces. Mr. Bennett is obvious in love with his hero Trajan, and has painstakingly amassed all relevant materials (textual, archaeological, numismatic, etc.) in order to somehow produce a continuous account of his reign. However, onece we are done with that, what remains for us modern readers who do not love Trajan for his own sake? Nothing much, I fear, as there is not a definite issue (e.g. Trajan's policies of imperial expansion, or his _alimenta_ schemes) to which the author should offer a solution taking Trajan as a model case. As Moses Finley said in his last book, this &quot;say everything you know about&quot; approach only leaves the reader with an idea of wasted intellectual acumen, and begs the issue of the actual relevance of knowledge on the subject. Unfortunately,the book is throughly reasearched, but fails to be actually intersting.	2003-05-31

As it is, I've been reading Dio piecemeal, having read his account of Augustus' reign in the Penguin edition and now his books on the reigns of the emperors from Claudius to Hadrian. Fact is, the latter are not Dio's original work, but an epitome composed by two Byzantines, Zonaras &amp; Xiphilinius, one thousand years after original composition (and, at the time, Dio's books on the reign of Antoninus Pius had already been lost). I'm aware of the fact that many historians complain about the absence of Dio's originals, but, in my humble opinion, this is something that must be taken with a grain of salt. Judging from the passages for which we have the original text, Dio was hopellessly verbose, had a very bad taste for the most turgid rhetoric, and, as I 've said elsewhere, he has a tendency to narrate real events (viz. the Battle of Actium) as if he were composing an script for a Xena episode, but without neither the sense of humour nor Lucy Lawless at his disposal. Therefore the fact that I suspect that the Byzantine digest is best, as it seems to convey all that had actual importance in the original and to spare us the tedious flowery Late Antique rethorics and the hackwork that Dio's invented speechs are (yes, I know that every Ancient historian did the same, but what I'm complaining about is not the reality of the speeches, but about their intrinsic intellectual value, and, sorry, Dio is no Thucydides). Be as it is, the Digest has preserved an anecdote that is the best in the whole volume, of the quite deaf emperor Claudius listening to complaints against his governor of Bythinia, and, being told by one of his freedmen that the delegation was offering stormy applause to said governor, decided that &quot;then he is going to be their procurator for two more years!&quot;.	2003-05-18

Marxist theorethician Ernest Mandel, who loved detective novels, and wrote a study on them (Delightful Murder) said that the detective novel, dealing as it does with the question of justice between individuals, could be conceived of only in a bourgeois society and, as he died before Steven Saylor had his say, I believe he would have found Gordianus' adventures impossible in advance. But then one has to marvel at the ability with which Saylor has found a way around this problem. In a pre-bourgeois society like late Republican Rome, no one seems very concerned about what Gordianus the Finder has to \\"find\\" or has actually \\"found\\": what they want from him is only a confirmation of their Ex Ante ideas about any issue. That leaves Gordianus himself with the task of pondering what is his place in a world he finds, as he grows old, incrasingly more uncongenial, brutish and corrupt and leaves a smaller room for mystery and more for historical speculation. But then that's the best solution that could be found for this book. Very good, highly recommended.	2002-11-05

This book is, above all, a collection of conspectuses about various classical authors' views on the factors(most related to the development of a distinctly Western mindframe) that triggered the commercial and technological dominance of the West from the XVIIIth Century on.

I worked as a research assistant under the late Anna Luiza in the early ninety-nineties, and one of my first chores was to revise the Portuguese original of this book, which is the by-product of a (very) throughly reasearch about the role of deforestating in the strategies of capital accumulation of small planters practcising slash-and-burn agriculture in the borders of the Amazon rainforest. Ozorio de Alamida's team simply took down note of _all_ yearly expenses and revenues of the small farmers included in the sample, in order to arrive at the conmclusion that, in the absence of a coherent public policy of funding, the only alternative for such small producers is to buy a forest plot and to deforestate it entirely _in order to resell it as pasture land_ and then to repeat this same move three to four times before eventually managing to settle down in a stable plot of their own. To all those who don't content themselves with sentimental generalizations, but want to have hard (and, I have to admit, dry)actual economic information about what is going on behind an ecological disaster. Due to the fact of Anna Luiza's untimely death in 1994, she is not here to discuss her work, and I wanted to advise all interested in the plights of the Amazon not to pass by this fine work.	2002-09-07

If you are to read this enigmatic work, you are already a Roman History buff, so beware to sort the fiction from actual history. Historia Augusta, in its better moments, renders the same flavor as a well-accomplished Xena episode; one feels befuddled by the mix between History, sheer invention and tongue-in-cheek humour; eventually, one wants to read more (well, supposing you are a Roman history buff and a xenite...) Therefore I regret very much the absence of an integral version of the whole work, that is the second half - the histories of the emperors after Heliogabalus - where fiction predominates, and which is perhaps the most intersting part in historical terms, as it is pratically the only written source for the most troubled years of the Roman Empire. Reading the work puts a most intriguing question: why it was that Late Antiquity found it necessary to look at its own past this way? Not a entirely otiose question in our postmodern days, I daresay.	2002-07-19

Surely, no small merit. However, I would like to point that Professor Skidmore has, above all, been influenced by the views of Brazilian scholars like professor Helio Jaguaribe, one of the founders of the famous 1950s Brazilian think-thank ISEB (Higher Institute of Brazilian Studies) who see Brazilian history mostly in terms of economic &quot;modernization&quot;, therefore does not paying that much attention to the blend of economic modernization _and_ political backwardness that makes so much of Brazilian history past and present - something stressed better by Marxist historians like Mario Pedrosa, Livio Xavier, and Florestan Fernandes. However, no one can blame Professor Skidmore for having chosen a given ideological outlook, and it's meritoriously enough that his books will remain, for a long time, necessary stumblin-blocks in the study of Brazilian history.	2002-07-11

The illustrations are superb, the information secure and grounded on the latest paleontological finds, the narrative intersting...in short, one fine example of BBC expertise in documentary-making. However, there's something that has, I'm afraid, gone astray in Chapter 5, where the author, in order to arrange for a confrontation between a pride of saber-tooth tigers and a giant ground sloth, comes with the idea that ground-sloths scavenged carcasses from predators \\"to supplement their diet\\". Now, where did this come from? I've never heard the slightest hint of evidence about that, and I found this particular piece of informed guess-work somewhat aberrant, to say the least. Seems like something atuned to the necessities of more dramatic story-telling of a kind of Pleistocene telenovela - perhaps because ground-sloths lived in what today is Argentina? Outside from this (admittedly small)slip, however, the book deserves to be bought, kept and cherished, from one generation to another.	2002-06-29

It is of course an \\"irony of history\\" that the disclosure of the Soviet archives benefited firstly anti-communist historians wont at writings \\"historical\\" - ie accusatory, chock-full with cheap moralizing commonplaces - narratives. For the last decade, the pioneering role in this field has been held by the notorious Richard Pipes and the no less notorious Volkongonov. The fact that a Russian historian with a Trotskyst viewpoint has chosen to profit from the same evidence is a good piece of news.<br />It is intersting that, although Rogovin had full access to the new materials (which he describes and quotes, although hampered by the clumsy use of \\"footnotes\\" as *end*-notes in the book) he does not write anything \\"new\\" about the period of the Great Purges that could not be already found in Trotsky's _The Revolution Betrayed_. In fact what he stresses is the fact that the growingt alienation of the Soviet party bureaucracy from the masses that had brought it to power meant that the individual members of that bureaucracy had growing access to privileges they were not prone to renounce, and - precisely because of this - they develped an ever increasing dependency, as far the maintenance of their political power positions was concerned, vis-a-vis the individual figure they had placed at the top, namely Joseph Stalin. Therefore the fact that they were to become sitting ducks to the same Stalin when the process of the purges started.<br />Once this is said, there's not much to be added to the picture, only that Rogovin, by following closely Trotsky in the matter, helps dispels Marxist illusions such as held by a Issac Deutscher of Stalin-as-the-modernizer-of backward-Russia; ; Rogovin's Stalin is , more than ever , a psychopatic serial killer. But then such a psychopath is put into an historical process that makes sense - and that is the main merit of this work.	2002-05-05

That was an error never commited by Sun Tzu, who regarded supreme skill as subduing the enemy without having to fight, a lesson not learned by many that chose to cling to Clausewitz's book, with his Machiavellian idea of war as a purely zero-sun-game.

When I decided to write this review, I had to choose between the various reasons why it's so beautiful and important. But, above all, I think that, in a world where the necessity of Marxist was supposedly to be more deeply felt than ever, what repels most people that would be liable to lend an ear to it is the repelling Stalinist mythology of the revolutionary as the relentless, ruthless, single-minded, google-eyed fanatical. Trotsky, on the contrary begins by assessing that, although his life was out of the ordinary, he neverthless remained a men with a penchant for a well-ordered ordinary life; that he found pleasure in seeing a well-ordered table or a well-kept fence; that he didn't becomne a revolutionary out of a feeling of opression, but because of being faced with a life that, although prosperous, offered him nothing but grey drudgery and no opprtunity for individual achievement; that he, like all revolutionaries, was a man like any other. I think that would be reason enough to commend this modern classic to the reader of today, outside from the wonderful style, the importance of the events narrated and so much else.	2002-01-07

To put it short, it's a book about the making of the epistemic (in the sense given by Foucault) of Athenian democracy.It's not about the class(slave-owning) foundations of Greek democracy, but how it was made to work by Athenian free citzens.

Of course this is a modern myth, based on a very selective reading of Homer's epic - which already betrayed a clear consciousness of the divide existing between the Human and the Divine, as well as of a further divide between the mythical Heroic age and the everyday realities of an archaic class society. Neverthless, this modern myth came to form the core of Luk&aacute;cs' lifelong research programme - the study of alienation, which came to form much of the best research of Western Marxism (after reading Luk&aacute;cs'work one can not imagine Adorno and Horkheimer's _Dialectic of the Enlightnment_ being written without Luk&aacute;cs' starting stone).

However, this fanfic was rendered by Ea in his costomary -and wonderful - ironic manner, as the glories of the Portuguese past portrayed in the short novel written by the hero are each moment contrasted to the pettiness and mediocrity of the present. Neverthless, Ea closes the novel by meking peace with the Portuguese bourgeois society of his day, ultimately proposing a kind of future Portuguese &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;, consisting in the making of a Portuguese African Empire (anyway, one can say that his support of such Portuguese colonial adventures is half-hearted, to say the least).

The plot is conventional melodrama, which explains its being presently serialized by Brazilian TV, in an adaptation that has as its chief fault to take the story too much seriously. Ea was, above all, a master of good-naturedly irony,a fact enhanced in this novel by his forswearing the more strict realistic manner of Zola and Flauber in favour of Thackeray's and Dickens'. That explains why, although the novel is full of fin-de-siecle pessimism - above all about the possibilities of a developed bourgeois society in backward Portugal being possible - it's still so damned funny. Ea's irony has only one parallel among his contemporaries, the Brazilian novelist Machado de Assis. However, Ea loves too much his creatures to submit them to the bitter and torturing irony of Machado's.Having seem this English translation, I regard it as correct (Ea's plain language requiring no great flights of fancy from the translator) but miss the absence of some footnotes on historical and political matters that could help modern readership to feel more at ease.

I made an earlier jokingly one-liner that does not justice to the book- or to Lenin. What I think should looked for in this book is exactly the following: that Lenin was the first marxist ever not to consider the development of class consciousness a kind of spontaneous outgrowth of the concrete existence of a working class. Therefore the necessity for politics - specially party politics - to take precedence in marxist analysis over pure economic analysis. This jump in esentials was made by Lenin very early in life, as his _Development of Capitalism in Russia_, written in his late twenties, is still a prime piece of economicistic marxism; _What is to be done?_ is already a prime owrk of a new, politics-first, approach. One may think whatever one wants of the solutions found by Lenin - abaove all the party of professional revolutionists, disciplined and centralized, but one may not deny him the fact that it was him who first made a new kind of marxist approach to issues that is still very much with us.	2001-01-21

Lenin assigns above all a class role to the State, and therefore ascertains correctly the necessity of a socialist state assuming a proletarian viewpoint. At the same time, Lenin's socialist state lacks a truly political dimension, as it remains, above all, a means for strictly administrative decision-making. Something that would gravely hamper the subsequent understanding of the political character of a future socialist state, specially when you think that this book was written while Lenin hid from the Kerensky government, that's to say just before the October Revolution. Neverthless, the problems put by the book have enormous present value. Therefore it must be taken as entirely questionable the decision to choose as translator an anti-communist like Service, something that would be quite like choosing a neo-stalinist to translate Trotsky's &quot;Revolution Betrayed&quot;.	2001-01-17

I began reading &quot;Capital&quot; in 1982, and having begun from scratch to read Book One, with the famous Hegelian section on the nature of the commodity as the standard form of social wealth in capitalism - a section skipped by most Anglo-Saxon abridgers, who tend to treat Marx as only a &quot;post-Ricardian&quot;, in Samuelson's (in)famous dictum - I should say that I fear any kind of abridgment done to this work.In my view, all abridgments tend to create a more palatable view of the work abridged, therefore skipping the most intersting and controversial passages. Better to read an abridgment than forswearing reading it altogether, but I would strongly recommend anyone interested in Marx to do as I've done and tackle the Penguin complete ed., not forgetting to begin with the huge and superb introductory essay by Ernest Mandel. It won't hurt you, as it will allow one to form his/her personal view. It may be somekind of snobbery from my part, given that I read such a difficult work in a translation not to my mother-language and aided by a lenghty commentary, but after so many years, I still think it paid.	2001-01-14

The hate-filled reviews this book, written by a Cambridge don and member of the Bloomsbury group, a patron of the arts who thought marxism &quot;one the most boring productions of human mind except for teology&quot;,has received here, are somekind of a surprise, were it not for the fact that Keynes' intellectual honesty simply led him to discover that capitalist economy was not only unequal (something that can be readily accepted by reactionnaries who believe in meritocratic rewards) but also irrational, as it was prompted by irrational expectatives that made it to rock between bullish euphorias and bearish depressions. The fact that capitalist economy does *not* necessarily favour the most enterprising and bright, as upward expectations and good ideas do not necessarily coincide, and that the State must do something in order to alleviate the sufferings producted by economic cycles, is something rabid free-marketers can not even stand to hear without beginning to heap abuse.

The author uses his concrete experience as a farmer in the San Fernando Valley to develop a fine point about the &quot;low intensity&quot; character of Classical Greek warfare. He argues that, the Greek city-states waging warfare through part-time citzen militias, the war strategy of all Greek polities centered on the idea of forcing a pitched battle in order not to keep citzens away too long for harvesting at home. The means used to force such a battle being to disturb the enemy's harvest, which, however, given the low technology tools avaliable and the resilience of the crop-species - specially olive trees - could never amount to permanent damage. Therefore the general low-intensity, boarding game character of much of Classical Greek military history. A fine argued, important book, specially for the firm grasp of the concrete realities at play.	2001-01-11

Basically, this book attempt to present Greek religion as it (supposedly) transits from a mythological explanation of the world, with the gods as concrete personifications of abstract notions, towards a rational religion where abstract attributes and social morals and philosophical ethics supersede mythology. Such an approach does little to explain the enormous resilience shown by Greek mythology until today, yet the account is enormously informative and gives much food for alternative thinking on the subject.Recommended as a handbook for the advanced student on the subject.	2001-01-04

As all Penguin Classics, this translation is intended to be enjoyable by a modern reader with no knowledge of the Classical languages who wants to introduce him/herself to the Classical authors. Therefore the colorful cover and the emminently readable translation. However, the cover - a mythological mosaic of the Later Roman epoch - has nothing to do with the subject-matter, and the translation falls sometimes into unduly modernizing. There is a place where one speaks of the Roman &quot;proletariat&quot;?! Personally, I should prefer a translation that was readable but which made no attempt to give the impression of Ancient-Roman-society-very-much-alike-to-ours. But I must admit that, compared to, say, the Portuguese translation by Barreto Feio (a fine speciment of XIXth century prose, and enormously cumbersome to a modern reader) this trans. fares better.	2000-11-12

This book is above all a defence of Historical Materialism and of the marxist methodology - with a emphasis on classes and concrete class interests - in the writing of History, as opposed to the  Structuralist analysis centered on self-sufficient discursive cathegories. It's issue-ordered, with Marxist and Structuralist methodologies contrasted on a issue-to-issue analysis,namely as applied to research on political history, class history, gender, race, and so on. The analysis is cogent and polemical. However, there is something amiss. The emergence of a discourse-based historiograph must be explained by a marxist as something dependent on a concrete and clear-cut class interest, and the author does not explain in whose interest this type of historiograph has developed - which is much more than to merely  asess and explain its un-Marxist ccharacter. Anyway, it's a work of reference for all interested in the analysis of methodological issues in the Social Sciences in general, and History in particular.	2000-11-12

This book, as  it was, was his last: it's a collection of articles that deal mostly with  the consequences of the redemocratization of Brazil  during the 1980s and  with the era of neoliberal reforms strated with the Collor government  (1990-1992) and continued during the Cardoso (1995-?) administration.

I have found this book, when added with K.J. Dover's Greek Homosexuality, to offer me all the information I needed on the subject of homosexuality in  Classical Antiquity. Williams does not make enough, perhaps, of the fact  that the Romans' low estimate of any male citzen performing the passive  role in sexual intercourse - that they equalled with adultery and rape in  the single legal category of *strupum*, in contrast to the Classical Age  Athenians' idealization of the supposedly pure love between the younger  *eromenos* and his *erastes* had much to do with the realities of Rome as  an oligarchical political system where no member of the ruling oligarchy  was supposed to submit to another, in contrast to the more democratic and  egalitarian Athenian mores, where you were supposed to learn to obey in  order to learn to give orders. But then, this is a conclusion that was  already there to be drawn. Superb book, highly recommended.	2000-08-16

I  think that the book's highlight is exactly in drawing a connection between  changes in artistic style and &quot;short range&quot; political events. So,  in the early days of Soviet power- from Lenin's time down to  collectivization - one has an Expressionistic, unreal style that tries,  above all, to convince strikingly the viewer to support a given political  &quot;lime&quot;. After Stalin's consolidation as leader, one has a  pseudo-realistic style praising the &quot;actual&quot; quality of living in  the USSR, in order to obtain the passive acquiescence of the viewer.

Dodds wants, above all to warn his  readers about how fragile the tradition of rational philosophical enquiry  is, and how easily it can degenerate, given the power of what he calls the  &quot;Inherited conglomerate&quot;. The hub of the book, therefore, resides  in the fact that Dodds remarks that the Greeks developed their  philosophical and scientific tradition between the Vth and the IIIrd  centuries BC and that - contrary to what the moderns would expect  expectations - that tradition, before an onslaught of mysticism, simply  floundered, having to be recovered painstakingly in the Late Western Middle  Ages. Having this in mind, one could profit better from this outstanding  work.	2000-06-19

Ancient History had always been pragmatical and worried itself about military and diplomatic information useful to statesmen of the future. Dio's history is a part of that tradition, coming, however, in Later  Antiquity, were possibilities of participating in political life were  restrained to those enrolled in the Imperial service, such as Dio, a Greek  with consular rank who made his carrer during the already burocratic and  militarized monarchy of the Severan dinasty. Therefore, Dio is concerned  mostly with the only political question remaining in his day: what are the  moral qualities that make the absolute ruler whorthy of praise and  therefore make him deserve to be pointed as an exemple to future rulers?  Therefore the fancy, retorical accounts (the account of Actium being so  fanciful as to remind one of a Xena script) and the endlessly imaginary  speechs on all kinds of moral topics. In short, Ancient historiography as  it begins to turn into the kind of moral encomia to rulers that would make  most of Mediaeval &quot;Political&quot; literature. Informs more about  Dio's mentality as a man of Late Antiquity than about the Reign of Augustus  - therefore its utility, which is great,as a chapter of a history of  mentalities.	2000-06-07

It's  a confused and confusing book, poorly ordered, with out-of-date  intellectual references; in short, it's a work of genius that is a  must-read for anyone wanting to understand Brazilian contemporary politics  and who wants a better fare than the eulogy connocted by conservative  American academics that think Cardoso to be &quot;good enough for  them&quot;.

This book is, above all, an eulogy made by a group of American academics with a conservative frame of mind of Cardoso's first term of government and his policies of privatization, de-regulamentation, social psending  budget-cuts, and all other such pieces of IMF-favoured economic orthodoxy.  Given the fact that: (1) just after the book was published, the Brazilian  economy was hit by an speculative attack on the Real that sent it lingering  during 1999;(2) despite the quick recovery attained, Brazil managed to  increse her per capita income during Cardoso's rule at a smaller rate then  during the already crisis-ridden 80s;(3) that the major ills of the  Brazilian society (land and income concentration, deep destitution, rampant  urban crime) remain untouched after Cardoso's 5 years in office - perhaps  the authors should allow me not to be as positively impressed as they are  (or were).

The author strives to prove that  the Impressionits' concentration on landscape and private life painting  was, above all, a kind of bourgeois whitewashing of the recent events of  the Paris Commune. This would make the book too much one-sided, were it not  for the author's later remarks on Seurat's paintings, that allow him to  fully grasp the fact that the pseudo-organic character of these pointillist  paintings reflect, more than bourgeois fear of a renewed Commune, the  self-confidence of a sucessful bourgeoisie in creating an stable social  order based on individualism and private accomplishements.	1999-12-24

The book  examines the supramacy of Socialist Realism in the field of visual arts  since Stalin's rise to absolute power until the demise of the USSR. <br />The  book is encyclopaedic in both narrative and visual terms, since it combines  an exahaustive historical account with an astounding array of 1st rate  reproductions, taken from all corners of the former Soviet Union.The main  shortcoming of the book would be only that, since it dwells not only in the  history of Socialist Realist painting as such, but also of its ideological  politic foundations (superbly examined) the books requires a prospective  reader that has not only a general interest in the relationship between Art  and Politics, but also an specific interest in both Soviet and Marxist  studies. It's, nonethless, this interdisciplinary aspect that makes for  much of the work's charm.	1999-01-12
