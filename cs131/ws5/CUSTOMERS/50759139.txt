Rave reviews from fans and critics (with the requisite comparisons to Ulysses, which is apt, but the sensibility here is, I think, more Faulknerian (with a touch of James Thurber thrown in) than Joycean) alike piqued my interest, and since I saw it on the shelves of my local public library, I decided to give it a whirl. <br /> <br />Little could have prepared me for the world that Ware would suck me into. <br /> <br />Jimmy Corrigan is one of those rare works that you encounter every once in a great while that is utterly unlike anything created in the medium before. In the fiction of James Joyce, the films of Murnau and Kubrick, and the music of the Velvet Underground and John Coltrane, those artists showed us previously undreamt-of possibilities in their chosen art forms. With Jimmy Corrigan, Ware is very clearly in their company. <br /> <br />You might pick this up and find it difficult. Well, of course it is - any work which reinvents the rules of the medium it's presented in is going to be. That doesn't mean it's not worth reading - on the contrary, Jimmy Corrigan's challenges are very much a part of the singular pleasures of its story. <br /> <br />Speaking of story - Chris Ware certainly knows how to tell one. Convoluted as the exposition of the comic (novel? interactive multi-media piece?) is, the payoff is (or was for me, anyway) more than worth it. <br /> <br />If you're interested in seeing where art is headed in the 21st century, Jimmy Corrigan is a good place to start finding out. <br /> <br />PS A caveat - I did skim parts of this book. I say this simply because I hate it when people skim books and then review them, and I apologize for doing so, but parts of the text sections of this book are printed in REALLY small print, and I was getting a terrible headache trying to read them all.	2004-09-28
US	50759139	R1DDR325R0SF2P	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Crime, Punishment, And Its Consequences	In Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange, we meet Alex, a nasty 15-year-old hoodlum living in a not-so-distant dystopian future who narrates his story to us in an invented slang called Nadsat (basically a cross between Russian and English). During a botched burglary, Alex accidentaly kills an old woman and is sent to prison to serve a 14-year sentence. A couple of years into said sentence, his jailers offer him a proposition - sign up for this experimental treatment which only lasts for a few weeks, and you're a free man. Alex, of course, does just this, much to his later chagrin - it turns out that this treatment takes the notion of \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" to undreamt-of extremes.<br />The first thing that clues you into the fact that A Clockwork Orange is not your run-of-the-mill popular fiction novel is the Nadsat. It may seem intimidating at first (I know it was intimidating to me, to the extent that I waited several months after I purchased the novel to actually start reading it),  but it actually only takes a chapter or two until you get the hang of it. If you have trouble with it, simply do a search on Google on \\"Nadsat\\" - you'll find at least half a dozen links to Nadsat-to-English glossaries. <br />The other thing that stands out (once you dig in a little bit) is the book's thematic complexity. A Clockwork Orange asks many difficult questions, none of which have easy answers: To what extent are we willing to punish criminals? Why have we always felt the need to dehumanize them? And finally this: if a man no longer has free will, is he truly a man?<br />One to put on the \\"challenging reading\\" shelf, and highly recommended (by me, anyway).	2003-02-26

One day while going through some old books of mine, I came across my (very) battered old copy of Before I Get Old, and, being \\"between books\\", decided to give it another whirl.<br />I was pleasantly suprised to see how well the book holds up. If nothing else, the sheer amount of research Marsh obviously did to put the book together is enormously impressive. Marsh's knowledge pays off in his ability to treat the book almost like a really wonderful non-fiction novel - it's a story many would consider unbelievable if it weren't actually true. Also in the book's favor is the fact that Marsh has herewithin abstained (praise God!) from the kind of \\"this guy/these guys can do no wrong\\" hero-worship which marred his Springsteen bio Glory Days.<br />The main issue I have with Marsh's book (and this is largely a matter of taste, I suppose) is the short shrift he gives to so much of the Who's post-Who's Next work. For example, he seems to regard their magnificient Quadrophenia as pretty much a failure. I think this is absurd. Quadrophenia may not be a perfect album, but I believe it stands as the ultimate realization of Townshend's long-standing ambition to create a musically- and narratively- linked song cycle, not to mention as one of the finest studio albums created by ANY artist, the Who or otherwise.<br />In spite of this, Before I Get Old still stands as the best Who bio that's been written to date. If you're a fan of the band, or are merely curious about the greatest rock band of all time, I highly recommend you pick this up.	2002-10-28

For example, let's look at some of the names of the dwarfs that Kevin Crossley-Holland includes in his notes for Myth 1 (&quot;The Creation&quot;): Bifur, Nori, Gandalf (!), Thorin, Fili, Kili, Thror, Thrain, Gloin, Dori, Ori, etc. Anyone familiar with Professor Tolkien's work probably had a cacophany of bells ringing in there head upon reading that. Note also that the name in the Norse myths for the plane of existence where humans live (as opposed to Asgard, the world of the gods, and Niflheim, the world of the dead) is Midgard, which translates into modern English literally as &quot;middle earth&quot;.<br />I could go on and on, but I might make it sound as though this collection is not worth reading in its own right - which is certainly not the case.<br />It took me a little while to get through this book, though I suspect that that had more to do with (a) the fact that I have not  been in much of a &quot;reading mood&quot; in the last few weeks, and (b) that I am one of those crazy people that insists upon reading each and every footnote as it comes up, than it did with the intrinsic interest of the material within. In fact, I was pleasantly suprised at just HOW entertaining and humorous a lot of these myths are. I've always felt that a lot of the old myths and religious texts (including a lot of the biblical ones) were structured as much for maximum entertainment value as they were for spiritual and intellectual enlightenment. Crossley-Holland, as he states a few times in his notes, agrees, and retells many of the myths in a light, breezy style that perfectly  suits their comical nature. I'm particularly thinking here of &quot;The Lay of Thrym&quot;, the hilarious tale of Thor's hammer Mjollnir was stolen, and of how he got it back.<br />In conclusion, I can't really compare Crossley-Holland's retellings of these Norse myths with any others, because, well... I haven't read any others (outside of the odd Marvel comic or two). But it seems to me that if this topic is of interest to you, you could find a lot of worse places than here to start.	2002-10-13

Crumb Coffee Table Art Book (Kitchen Sink Press Book for Back Bay Books)	Books	5	36	37	N	N	The Amazing Id Of Robert Crumb	There's an illustration on the back cover of The R. Crumb Coffee Table Art Book that perfectly encapsulates the artist's work - it depicts the top of Robert's head exploding, with several of his creations, famous, infamous, and otherwise, leaping out.<br />That, to me, sums up Crumb's work - this incredibly inventive artist with, to paraphrase Bob Dylan, a head full of ideas that are drivin' him insane.<br />There are frequent complaints about Crumb's work being too dark, racist, sexist, and/or misogynistic. While I can see where these criticisms come from, I really don't think Crumb is any darker, more racist, sexist, or misogynistic than any of us - he simply is unafraid to - COMPELLED to, almost - lay his cards on the table. Some people find this offensive. Would it be absurd of me to suggest that some of those who are offended by his work have their own issues with sexism, racism, and/or misogyny that they are unwilling to confront?<br />What I'm trying to get at here, I guess, is that this IS NOT a book for little kids. There's a sticker on the front of my copy of the book that says \\"FOR ADULT INTELLECTUALS ONLY!\\", and while I'm not so sure about the \\"intellectuals\\" part, this is probably not a book  you want your grade-school age child to get ahold of, unless you're okay with said child seeing depictions of graphic (and I do mean GRAPHIC) sex, hard-core drug use, and extreme (albiet cartoonish) violence.<br />I realize all I've spent all this space talking about Crumb without ever really discussing what I like about his work. I think  there's two main things: (1) his unflinching honesty (as I touched upon earlier), and (2) the incredible beauty of his draftsmanship. I think my favotite chapter in the whole book is the one that features his pen-and-ink still-lifes and landscapes. Just beautiful stuff - worth studying for his use of cross-hatching alone.<br />In conclusion, if you're at all interested in checking out the work of one of the finest artists to everwork in the comics medium, I highly recommend you get this book. It's easily worth the 25 bucks.<br />Oh, yeah - and it DOES make a wonderful coffee table book. :)	2002-09-12
US	50759139	R213ZRX64Z4L9E	0345325818	619220705	The Silmarillion	Books	5	19	19	N	N	To Be Sipped, Rather Than Gulped	...<br />... this is NOT a novel. It is, rather, a collection of stories, more or less chronologically arranged, detailing the history of Middle-earth, from the creation of its universe to the end of its Third Age (the time period in which Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings take place). If you go into The Silmarillion expecting a ...kicking fantasy novel along the lines of LOTR, you will more than likely be sadly disappointed.<br />Having said that, I think this is some of Tolkien's best work. The key thing to remember is that this is fine wine, not Boone's Farm    (not that there's anything wrong with Boone's Farm ;)) - it is to be sipped, rather than gulped.<br />However, plain sailing it's not. A few tips, then, to hopefully make your reading experience a more pleasurable one.<br />1) Read The Hobbit and LOTR FIRST. They are much more acessible introductions to Tolkien's universe than The Silmarillion is. Also, there are some major spoilers to LOTR in The Silmarillion, so if you read The Silmarillion first, you'll know how LOTR turns out before you read it (a very bad thing).<br />2) You'll probably find it helpful to read The Silmarillion as soon as possible after finishing LOTR, especially if you at least skim its appendices. The will give you a helpful road map to The Silmarillion.<br />3) Take it slow, particularrly in reading the first 60-70 pages.  Remember, this is a gourmet meal, so take the time to savor each morsel. Read 15 or 20 pages, set it aside, meditate on it for awhile, and then pick it back up again. You might also find it helpful to read certain passages aloud, not just for clarification's sake, but to really appreciate the poetry of Tolkien's prose.<br />4) This may sound ridiculous, but I found it helpful to write down the names the chiefs of the Valar (Manwe, Varda, Ulmo, etc.) with a brief description of each on a 3 X 5 card and use it as a bookmark, so I had a handy reference of who was who while I was reading.<br />5) Don't beafraid to look stuff up! Christopher Tolkien was kind enough to include genealoies, a table detailing the Sundering of the Elves, a glossary of names, and other helpful references in the back of the book. Also, you might find an additional glossary, such as Robert Foster's excellent Complete Guide To Middle-Earth, helpful to your enjoyment of the book.<br />Having said all that, if you get 70 or so pages into it and it's just not happening for you, you're probably better of just dropping it and reading something else. It's okay - it's not a book for everyone. But if you do decide to stick it out - enjoy! This is epic storytelling at its best.	2002-08-23

The price is also nice. A dollar fifty? What can you buy for a dollar fifty these days?<br />My sole complaint regards the absence of footnotes. Take \\"Cask Of Amontillado\\", for example. It's hardly essential to know that \\"motley\\" is the garb of a jester or a clown (or that a \\"pipe\\" is a wine cask) in order to enjoy the story, but that information would have been nice to have nonetheless. <br />In conclusion, this collection is a wonderful bargain, but if you have a little more money you may want to invest in an annotated collection of these tales.	2002-08-01

Tolkien is the way we gain insight into the inspirations for Tolkien's writings. We learn of Tolkien's fascination with the fictions of William Morris and George MacDonald; Norse, Icelandic and Anglo-Saxon mythology; and, perhaps most importantly, Tolkien's desire to create a mythology FOR ENGLAND. <br />Tolkien's life may have been, on the face of it, a little dull, but Carpenter does a wonderful job here of opening up for us the incredible excitement of Tolkien's INNER life - that is, the way he was able to incorporate his life-long love for and fascination with language and culture into a body of work that will, I think, continue to be read and cherised long after we are all dead and gone.<br />Essential reading for all Tolkien fans and for all who wish to have a better undestanding of the creative mind.	2002-07-22

Let me count the ways.<br />1) The quality of the writing here is astonishing. I mean, all false modesty aside: I've read the New Testament, Shakespeare, Joyce, Toni Morrison - you name it. Alan Moore's writing is at that level. Seriously.<br />2) The artwork is incredibly beautiful. Dave Gibbons works squarely in the tradition of such comics greats as Wallace Wood and Bill Elder, but takes their work to a whole new level of symbolic complexity. Just the draftsmanship here will take your breath away.<br />3) The sense of cinema Moore and Gibbons bring to the work is beguiling. One almost has to look to films like Citizen Kane and Touch Of Evil (and novels like Ulysses and The Sound And The Fury) to find an analogy to the enormity of their accomplishment in this medium.<br />4) The juxtapositions of words and pictures are wonderful. Moore and Gibbons are constantly playing text off illustration (and vice versa) to often stunning, often hilarious effect.<br />5) \\"Marooned\\", the comics-story-within-a-comics-story in Chapters III through XI, is one of the most harrowing things I've ever read in my life.<br />6) I love the way the story, like Joyce's Finnegan's Wake, ends up where it begins.

US	50759139	R3AV30905DWTOE	0375504397	237509158	Black House: A Novel	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A Wonderful Novel - Better Than Its Prequel	Here's what you need to know:<br />Black House is the sequel to Stephen King and Peter Straub's 1984 novel The Talisman. The Talisman concerns the adventures of one Jack Sawyer, a boy who travels to a parallel universe called the Territories to retrieve a magical globe which will save his mother, her Territories \\"Twinner\\", and the Territories itself. Black House is set 20 years later, in the present. Jack is now a retired homicide detective on the trail of the Fisherman, a murderer who seems to be a copycat of serial killer Albert Fish.<br />Black House is, I think, the stronger novel of the two. First of all, it's a more original conception. While The Talisman was a relatively straight-forward epic fantasy novel, in Black House King and Straub mix and match many different genres: fantasy, horror, crime, and Western fiction. It comes off as a sort of cross between Elmore Leonard and H.P. Lovecraft, which sounds unwieldy but ends up working just fine.<br />Secondly, Black House is the stronger work stylistically. Whereas in The Talisman, Straub failed to reign in King's more operatic tendencies (not an easy task, I'm sure), in Black House this isn't a problem. The authors opt for a first-person plural point of view here, which, like the cross-genre pollination of the novel, could have been awkward but instead lends a nice cinematic feel to the proceedings.<br />In characterization, Black House is again superior to its prequel. This isn't to knock The Talisman - as in almost all of King's work, the characters are consistently interesting and well-developed (I've read very little of Straub's solo work, so I can't really comment on it). It's just that Black House has perhaps the most engaging characters in a King novel since The Stand. Particularly brilliant is Henry Leyden, the blind DJ who befriends Jack and helps persuade him to take on the Fisherman case - he alone makes the novel worth reading.<br />Perhaps what makes the novel most worthwhile is its resonance. Literary allusions abound here (the title is a play on Dickens' Bleak House, and there also references to the works of Poe, Malamud, and many others), the most significant of which are to King's Dark Tower series (especially to readers (like me!) who are eagerly awaiting the next book). The Dark Tower references may be occasionally annoying to those who are new to King's work, but I think there's enough explication here to make those allusions only a minor stumbling block.<br />In short, I recommend Black House to... well, just about everybody. Like horror? Fantasy? Crime fiction? Classic American or British Lit? You'll probably find something in here to interest you.<br />Trust me. This is a really good one.	2002-05-23

This has a lot to do with the scope of the story King and Straub are telling - they're creating a whole new world here, which requires quite a bit of exposition.<br />The Talisman is intented, I think, as an homage to several great English-language authors. Tolkien is the most obvious influence here (his Lord Of The Rings is name-checked about half a dozen times), though the works of Mark Twain hold an equally pervasive sway (two quotations from Huck Finn serve as the opening epigraphs for the novel, and it concludes with a quote from Tom Sawyer). Less readily apparent but still important influences include Kerouac's On The Road (with its theme of cross-country travel as a means of self-discovery) and Stephen R. Donaldson's Thomas Covenant novels (of which King is a fan).<br />In conclusion, although The Talisman is hardly a perfect novel, it is certainly an engaging, and often powerful, piece of work. Highly recommended to fans of epic fantasy and those who are interested in seeing two of our finest horror writers try something a little bit different.	2002-04-27

Here's an overview of what you'll find here:<br />Tape 1, Poetry For The Beat Generation, a recording of Kerouac reading his poetry accompanied by television personality Steve Allen on piano. This is probably the weakest tape in the set. Altough it contains a couple of Kerouac's better poems (\\"Charlie Parker\\" and \\"The Wheel Of the Quivering Meat Conception\\"), most of his other work here comes off as self-indulgent and pretentious. Allen's piano is workmanlike but dull. <br />Rating: **<br />Tape 2, Blues And Haikus, is a little better. Here, Kerouac's accompanied by Al Cohn on saxophone and piano and Zoot Sims on saxophone. The standout track here is \\"American Haikus\\", featuring Kerouac reading short snatches of often striking, imagistic poetry in between Cohn and Sims' riffing saxes. Suprise: \\"Hard Hearted Old Farmer\\", on which Kerouac sings (!).<BR>Even Bigger Suprise: He's not too bad (!!). Crazy, man, crazy. <br />Rating: **1/2<br />Tape 3, Readings By Jack Kerouac On The Beat Generation, is easily the best one of the bunch. This concentrates more on Jack's prose pieces, which is its saving grace. Standout track: \\"Fantasy: The Early Years Of Bop\\", which, with the exception of Lester Bangs' essay on Van Morrison's Astral Weeks (collected in his excellent Psychotic Reactions And Carburetor Dung), is probably the best piece of music writing I've come across.<br />Rating: ****<br />Tape 4, The Last Word, consists of outtakes from the Blues And Haikus sessions; a speech entitled \\"Is There A Beat Generation?' from a Brandeis University lecture of the same name, and brief readings from Visions Of Cody and On The Road from a 1959 television appearance. These range from the embarrassingly bad (the Blues And Haikus outtakes, featuring on obviously drunk Kerouac) to the sublime (the '59 TV show readings), which makes the tape a fitting capper to the set.<br/>Rating: **1/2<br />In sum - if you're a Kerouac fan, you'll probably want to check this out. If you're new to his work, you're probably better off starting with one of his novels - On The Road is probably his best.	2002-04-18

That is to say, it contains the best examples of what works and what doesn't in Burroughs' fiction.<br />First, what doesn't:<br />1) If you have a problem with ridiculous coincidences, The Return Of Tarzan is probably not for you. I sometimes think \\"Serendipity\\" is Burroughs' real middle name. For example: in ROT, Tarzan is thrown overboard and swims ashore to the same spot on the west coast of Africa where he was born. A little later, Jane Porter, the love of Tarzan's life, is shipwrecked at the EXACT SAME SPOT.<br />(Wait, it gets better.)<br />Finallly, Paul D'Arnot, Tarzan's best friend, JUST HAPPENS to be patroling that same strech of African coast and JUST HAPPENS to decide to investigate Tarzan's birthplace AT THE SAME TIME that Tarzan and Jane are there.<br />I mean, come ON.<br />2) As Gore Vidal has pointed out, Burroughs couldn't write dialogue to save his life. For example, in ROT he has Rokoff, the novel's heavy, exclaim, \\"Name of a name!\\". Does anyone talk like this? Has anyone EVER talked like this?<br />Next, what does:<br />1) Burroughs is, as much if not more so than any writer of his generation, a natural born yarn-spinner. If I had to pick any writer, living or dead, to sit around the campfire with my friends and I and keep us entertained, Burroughs would probably be the one.<br />2) Burroughs was absolutely gifted in describing action, fight scenes in particular. I think the great Robert E. Howard may have been his only peer in this regard.<br />3) Burroughs probably gets more mileage out of the \\"fish-out-of-water\\" scenario than any writer I've ever read. My favorite example of this is a scene in which Tarzan, wild man of Africa, is depicted haunting the libraries and museums of Paris by day, and sipping absinthe(!) and smoking cigarettes at Parisian clubs by night. What a picture! Did he ever run into Ernest Hemingway? Now THERE'S an idea for a story!<br />Upon reading The Return Of Tarzan, many would say it's a fairy tale, pure escapism.<br />Well, thank goodness for that. Burroughs may not have been a peer of the Vidals and Hemingways of the world; nonetheless, we need him just as much.	2002-04-02

Burroughs' tale of a young English lord raised by savage apes, though somewhat tarnished by its reliance on stereotypes (racial and otherwise), retains the power of primordial myth.<br />There's a lot to be said of Burroughs' writing, both good and bad, but in the interest of brevity I'll simply pass along this caveat: do not start this book without having its sequel (The Return Of Tarzan) on hand. I made this mistake and, as I write this, am cringing in frustration at not knowing the resolution of the cliffhanger ending.<br />Having said that, I highly recommend this to all lovers of adventure fiction.	2002-03-07

Butler simply wanted to tell a bunch of funny stories about his former employer; Fletcher covers this ground, too, but primarily wants to make a case for Keith Moon as Great Artist. Partly because of this approach, it's probably the better book.<br />Keith Moon seems to be suffering from Jimi Hendrix Syndrome these days: that is to say, there seems to be this notion running around that he was merely some sort of drug-crazed lunatic making a lot of racket on his chosen instrument. The truth of the matter is that Keith was a musician of extraordinary intelligence and attentiveness. One of the things I like best about Fletcher is his ability to hear what was going on in Moonie's playing and to explain it in a way that the ordinary reader can understand.<br />Fletcher's not always the greatest prose stylist, and has a tendency to get a bit fannish and/or maudlin at times, but on the whole he's written a thoughful, engaging biography of this outstanding musician. I hope that both fans and nay-sayers will take the time to check it out.	2002-02-12

No - I doubt even his most devoted fans would say so. Was he, in Mr. King's amusing phrase, a &quot;Great World Writer&quot;? Again, no - even the most forgiving literary critic probably wouldn't bestow that title upon him. Was he, however, a born storyteller with a (literally) wonderful imagination? That I don't think anyone would seriously argue.<br />Burroughs' Martian novels, as I have said elsewhere, are great fun for both the the young and young at heart. Think Errol Flynn in outer space and you've got the basic idea. Escapist fiction doesn't get much better than this.	2002-01-21

Loewen explains how, in a misguided attempt to whitewash one of the most exciting fields of academic study, the publishers and authors of high school history textbooks have made the subject about as interesting as last week's oatmeal. <br />Many may avoid this fascinating book, expecting it to be some sort of left-wing tract, but Loewen is admirably fair-minded. He's also laugh-out-loud funny at times, as evinced by this footnote on the assassination of President Kennedy: &quot;Many Americans found Oliver Stone's film JFK persuasive, even though the conspiracy it concocts seems to include Vice President Johnson, the Pentagon brass, the CIA, the military-industrial complex, the Mafia, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.&quot;<br />I could pick nits here (the index could be better, there could be more coverage of the labor movement, etc.), but overall this is riveting and informative reading.

Carter's supposed to be this brilliant guy, a master strategist, a think-on-his-feet kind of fella who can puzzle his way out of any dilemma, no matter how difficult. So why is it that when he is presented with something so simple as the &quot;mystery&quot; of the identity of one of the major characters, said identity being so glaringly obvious that the reader has it figured out within a paragraph of the character's introduction, it takes Carter SEVERAL CHAPTERS to figure out who this guy is?<br />This inconsistency (not the only one, I'm afraid), isn't really all that bothersome in and of itself, but it's problematic in that it (sin of sins!) takes the reader out of the story. In a novel like The Gods Of Mars, all you've GOT is story. Anything that takes you out of it is therefore a major flaw.<br />I still enjoyed a lot of The Gods Of Mars, and will probably read The Warlord Of Mars (the next book in the series) if for no other reason than to see how TGOM's cliffhanger ending is resolved (yes, I admit it, I wanna find out). I just hope it's an improvement upon its predecessor.	2001-11-21

And that's fine - part of the accomplishment of Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson, and inheritors like Lester Bangs and Nick Tosches was to give the lie to the notion of journalistic objectivity. Just know that you're looking for a straight-foward presentation of facts, figures, and information about Project Mercury and its astronauts, you're probably gonna want to start somewhere else.<br />The upside of Wolfe's New Journalistic approach is that book is a tremendous amount of fun, recounting the stories of the Mercury astronauts with a wry, ironic wit that's all his own. There are, however, a few stylistic problems here - Wolfe's tone doesn't always suit the material at hand, particularly in the first chapter, which deals with the tragic deaths of many of the early test pilots of experimental jet planes. Also, he has a fondness for exclamatory interjections (e.g., on the very first page we get , &quot;But the day was young! And what a setting she had for her imminent enlightenment! And what a picture she herself presented!&quot; - all in a row, just like that) that can grow tiresome after a while.<br />For the most part, though, the writing works - Wolfe pulls off the admirable feat of making fun of pulp writing styles and reveling in them, often simultaneously. Also, there are some long paragraphs in here (particularly the one towards the end of the book where he describes Chuck Yeager's final test flight) that are minor miracles of literary construction.<br />All in all, definitely worth reading if you're interested in the subject at hand, or in exploring a unique literary voice.<br />*Not to worry, New Yorkers - Wolfe makes fun of Texans, Russians, and just about everybody else here, too.	2001-06-28

Lionel's Tourette's causes him to, among other things, bark like a dog, compulsively pat other people on the shoulder, and spout out nonsensical phrases, an example of which gives this review its title (another favorite of mine is &quot;Lancelot ancillary oscillope!&quot;).<br />I'm not sure what to say about Motherless Brooklyn, except I can't remember the last time I had this much fun reading a novel. Someone apparently forgot to tell Mr. Lethem that &quot;serious fiction&quot; isn't supposed to be entertaining and funny. Here's hoping no one ever does.	2001-06-20

I just want to say that if you're someone who avoids reading &quot;the literary stuff&quot; because you think it's going to be too difficult, this is probably the book to change your mind.

In Double Trouble: Bill Clinton And Elvis Presley In A Land Of No Alternatives, Greil Marcus examines a metaphor suggested by, among others, filmmaker Oliver Stone and New York Times columnist Frank Rich: Bill Clinton as Elvis Presley. Woven in & out of this central thread are the stories of other Americans living in the spotlight during the Clinton years: among them, Bob Dylan, Kurt Cobain, Allen Ginsberg, and Hillary Clinton. It's an interesting idea, and certainly (on the face of it, at least) no less tenable a springboard for a book than the theses that any of Marcus' other books are based on. There's only one small problem: it doesn't wash.<br />The quality of Marcus' writing isn't an issue here: stylistically, I'd put him up against anyone working today, and his erudition remains astonishing (reading him, I frequently find myself asking: \\"Is there a book this guy HASN'T read? A piece of music he HASN'T heard?\\"). Nor is it the individual chapters: many of them are great - opening up vistas in music, films, and politics you hadn't imagined were there.<br />No, the difficulty lies in Marcus' conclusion: simply put, I find the notion that Clinton approached Elvis Presley as a force for cultural liberation absurd. Clinton is obviously a very intelligent man and was an extraordinarily charismatic leader, but at the end of the day, he was just another politican. Elvis Presley broke - exploded - American culture in half. I don't think Clinton, as either president or cultural leader, can make a claim half so big.	2001-06-09

Their cut-off date was December 31, 1964, so you're not going to read anything in here that's less than 35 years old.<br />The problem with this is obvious: science fiction, more than any other genre, does not always age well. What is gloriously new &amp; exciting in 1930 or 1940 is old news in 2001. Some of the early stories (they're arranged chronologically), while probably great fun to read when they were first published, now have a kitschy, dated quality that's hard to get past.<br />Having said that, the best stories in this book (my nominees include Isaac Asimov's &quot;Nightfall&quot;, Jerome Bixby's &quot;It's A GOOD Life&quot;, and Daniel Keyes' heartbreaking &quot;Flowers For Algernon&quot;) have a resonance &amp; a timelessness that mark the best stories, SF or otherwise.<br />If you're looking for a good capsule history of the SF of this era, warts &amp; all, you could do a lot worse than to pick this up. I'm certainly glad it's on my bookshelf.	2001-06-08

The downward spiral begins when Jack heads into San Francisco and begins a weeks-long bout of heavy drinking. A sad tale, but a valuable one - and, as always with Kerouac, a beautifully written one as well. Marred only slightly by an overly optimistic (though somehow appropriate) ending.<br />(A note on the reading: Tom Parker does a fine job here, though his narration may run by a bit quickly for some.

Hate to be the nay-sayer of the bunch, but here goes.<br />When I first received the Elektra: Assassin trade paperback as a Valentine's Day gift from my wife, I was really excited. I had missed the original Frank Miller/Bill Sienkiewicz mini-series when it was released in the 80s, and was looking forward to reading a collaboration by two of my favorite comics creators.<br />Boy, was I disappointed.<br />So what's the problem?<br />Well, it certainly isn't any lack of talent on the creators' part. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the history of comics, Frank Miller was among the handful of creators responsible for the complete revitialization of the medium in the 1980s. His work on the Daredevil title for Marvel and his Batman mini-series (The Dark Knight Returns and Year One) for DC, along with Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen, set standards of excellence in the superhero genre which have yet to be surpassed.<br />Sienkiewicz, though not as well known, is an equally formidable talent. Incorperating the mixed-media techniques of Robert Rauschenberg and the bizarre caricatures of Ralph Steadman into his work, Sienkiewicz broke ground in comics illustration that other artists (Dave McKean and David Mack, outstanding artists themselves) ended up getting most of the credit for.<br />So a collaboration between Miller and Sienkiewicz should be great, right? Well, yeah, and it has been - those of you who have not already purchased their 1986 graphic novel Daredevil: Love And War are advised to do so immediately.<br />So, again, what's the problem?<br />Lack of ideas? Well... let's see what we got here: ninjas, cyborgs, espionage, possesion (demonic and otherwise), Biblical prophesy, stream of consciousness monologues, fractured narrative, photomontage... JEEZ! No, if any comics series ever created suffers from a lack of ideas (there are several - trust me) - buddy, this ain't it.<br />So... what's the PROBLEM?<br />Well, the problem has a lot to do with the creators biting off a bit more than they can chew. Any one of the aforementioned ideas or techniques could be developed into an interesting mini-series. Trying to deal with a dozen of them at once just creates a muddled, pretentious mess.<br />And then there's the small problem of character development. Elektra, who I assumed would be the protagonist here, winds up being sidelined in her own mini-series. Instead, John Garrett, one of Miller's least interesting hard-boiled anti-heroes, takes center stage.<br />Also, there's the issue of theme. Call me old-fashioned, but I kind of expect my stories to have a point. The central theme of Elektra: Assassin is... what? That politicians are simply tabulae rasae, upon which we project whatever we like? That the Democrats are just as screwed up as the Republicans? C'mon guys -you can do better than that.<br />In conclusion, I don't mean to totally slam this work - there's certainly a lot more creativity here than in the latest X-Men rip-off, and there are some beautiful moments here, both visual &amp; verbal. But would I seriously recommend that you slap down 25 bucks for this puppy? Nope -  not unless you've got a lot more bread than I do.	2001-02-24

Or is there? This is the central dilemma of Geore Orwell's Keep The Aspidistra Flying.<br />Keep The Aspidistra Flying is the story of Gordon Comstock (&quot;common stock&quot;?), an idealistic young man who leaves a respectable middle-class job in an effort to free himself from what he sees as the stultifying greed of bourgeois exsistence. Like that other great English novelist, Charles Dickens, Orwell trots out a varied cast of eccentric characters to keep us entertained as he makes his points. While lacking the history-stopping power of later works such as Animal Farm and 1984, Keep The Aspidistra Flying posseses a dry wit and a heartfelt charm that is all its own. Recommended to idealistic young men (and women) everywhere.	2001-02-15

The reason I bring this up is that I imagine individual reactions to this book will be profoundly colored by the age of the reader.<br />Okay, moving right along...<br />First, the great stuff; the first story, &quot;Low Men In Yellow Coats&quot;, and its companion piece, &quot;Heavenly Shades Of Night Are Falling&quot;, are wonderful - among the best work King has yet produced. Both pieces are beautifully written, deeply moving meditations on books, reading, love, and life - worth the price of admission by themselves. As a bonus, those like myself who have been eagerly awaiting next installment of King's Dark Tower series will be delighted with these stories' allusions to the world of Roland &amp; Co.<br />Next, the good stuff: the third and fourth stories (&quot;Blind Willie&quot; and &quot;Why We're In Vietnam&quot;, respectively) are quite enjoyable - not inspired King, but still King using his not-inconsiderable storytelling craft as well as he ever has. &quot;Why We're In Vietnam&quot;, incidentally, also has a (subtle) tie-in with the Stand/Eyes Of The Dragon/Dark Tower cycle of stories (do the initials &quot;R.F.&quot; ring a bell?).<br />Finally, the okay stuff: the second story, &quot;Hearts In Atlantis&quot;, is a pretty good short novel that is regrettably marred by a banal &quot;I am Spartacus!&quot; climax. Still, a fun yarn for anyone who's ever been a college student, in the 60s or otherwise.<br />In conclusion - if you're a King fan, be sure to pick this one up. If you're new to his work, you may want to start with one of his earlier works - the aforementioned novel The Stand or his excellent Different Seasons collection remain, I think, the best places to start.	2001-01-31

My expectations were not high - I had read The Firm several years ago and, while I enjoyed it, it felt more like a rollercoaster than a novel. With The Street Lawyer, however, we find that Grisham has eased off the melodrama and developed a bit of a conscience. All the Grisham trademarks are here - fantastic opening scene, dynamite pacing, colorful characters - but he's given us some food for thought as well. I'm sure there are those that will accuse him of being didactic here, but if he makes a few more people aware of the plight of the disenfranchised in doing so, I don't really have a problem with that. If you're looking to dip into the legal thriller genre, you could do a lot worse than this.	2000-12-03

A very dark novel - also a very funny novel, often at the same time. There were passages where when I was reading them I wasn't sure whether to laugh or to vomit.

But to portray The Grapes Of Wrath as merely some sort of leftist tract is to betray its power, its depth.

One of the things Mr. Ellison's fine story points out is that sacrifice is a necessary part of change. Ellison's parable-like tale shows us that someone must be willing to play the fool, the harlequin, to rage against convention, in order for any real change to be made. <br />Form follows content perfectly on this story - like Joyce, like cummings &amp; Kerouac, Ellison delights in playing with language, just as his story's hero delights in playing with the rules of his society. Ellison has sometimes gone overboard in trying to show how hip &amp; clever he is, but in this instance, he gets everything right.<br />In short - highly recommended.	2000-10-12

I made the mistake of starting Wiseguy shortly after I had borrrowed a big stack of comics from a friend of mine. I had picked it up with the intention of reading only a few pages, a momentary prose diversion in the middle of all that sequential art. Did things go as planned? Fuggidabahdit. Once I picked up Wiseguy, I found it just about impossible to put down.<br />One of the things that made Wiseguy such compelling reading was getting to see first-hand how a working-class kid like Henry Hill got sucked into the criminal world. We hear a lot of talk these days about how the media glamorizes crime. Could it be that crime is often, in and of itself, glamorous? That's certainly the picture Hill paints in Mr. Pileggi's interviews with him.<br />I don't know if Wiseguy will go down in history as one of the great works of American literature, but if the job of narrative is to put you inside someone else's head, Mr. Pileggi succeeds admirably. I advise anyone with the least amount of interest in organized crime to obtain a copy of this book. ... .	2000-10-12

Though lacking the epic scope of that work, You Can't Be Neutral On A Moving Train is, in its way, just as good.<br />In it, we learn about Professor Zinn's experiences in civil rights and anti-war movements, in classrooms and in jails, at home and abroad. We meet any number of extraordinary people (not the least of which is Professor Zinn himself) and witness extraordinary events. Most importantly, perhaps, we see how the actions of ordinary people, however seemingly insignificant at the time, can have extraordinary effects.<br />Highly recommended to anyone who wants to see a cause for optimism in these troubling times.	2000-10-05

Believe me, it was money well spent.<br />There are a few duds  in this collection (doesn't every anthology have some?), but they are by  far outweighed by the gems. Some examples of the latter: the outrageous  Joycean wit of Philip Jose Farmer's &quot;Riders Of The Purple Wage&quot;,  the dream-like beauty of Carol Emshwiller's &quot;Sex And/Or Mr.  Morrison&quot;, John Sladek's shockingly prophetic &quot;The Happy  Breed&quot;, and Kris Neville's Salingeresque humor in &quot;From The  Government Printing Office&quot;.<br />If you like science fiction, or just  enjoy well-crafted stories, by all means - seek this out.	2000-09-10

He does an  excellent job of deflating the pretenses of both left- and right-leaning SF  authors, not to mention his direct hits on wack jobs and elitists both in  and outside the genre. Disch sometimes tries a little too hard to show you  how clever he is, but, as I indicated earlier, his irreverent sense of  humor saves the day. Most imporantly, perhaps, he reminds us that  &quot;[a]rt is a kind of play, and those who forget how to be playful are  likely to produce art that is ever more mature and responsible and  ponderous&quot;.<br />&quot;Must&quot; reading for anyone interested in  science fiction and its influence on our culture.	2000-09-05

I can't say I agree with everything Professor Zinn has to  say here, but it's sure a refeshing alternative to the narrow-minded  approach of many U.S. histories. An important book to read in this (or any  other) election year. Insprational Quote: &quot;[Most history books] teach  us that the supreme act of citizenship is to choose among saviors, by going  into a voting booth every four years to choose between two white and  well-off Anglo-Saxon males of inoffensive personality and orthodox  opinions.&quot;	2000-08-19

His ideas are always well thought-out &amp; intellegent (with the  exception of his absurdly Skinnerian solution for juvenile delinquency),  though he seems to have trouble integrating them into the narritive. Still,  Heinlein keeps the story moving along briskly, &amp; anyone who enjoys a  good SF yarn should give this a shot. Better yet, pick up his STRANGER IN A  STRANGE LAND - a much more mature &amp; artful book.	2000-07-23

For example, who is the Malcolm of the title? Malcolm X? Malcolm McDowell? It was only once I checked the customer reviews at Amazon.com  that I learned it's Malcolm Muggeridge. Also, where are Muggeridge's  replies to Lewis' letters? However brilliant it may be, it's difficult to  put Lewis' correspondence into context without reading the other side of  the discussion.	2000-06-26

Not everyone, especially these days, may enjoy Tosches' iconoclastic embrace of the grotesque, but those who  like their humor dark &amp; their narratives darker certainly will.  Stylistically, the prose runs to the pretentious at times (&quot;a  tumescense that was more than urethral&quot;? Please.), but is generally  lyrical &amp; pleasing. Definitely an above-average piece of genre fiction.	2000-06-21

Not only do we get one of King's characteristically mesmerizing, twisty-turny plots, but a work that has a  lot to say about life, work, art, and the power of doing nothing. I could  pick nits about some of the rather caricatured bad guys &amp; clunky bits  of writing (they're both here) but, as Bartleby, and his contemporary  counterpart Mike Noonan, would say, I prefer not to.	2000-06-12

Though I can't say I agree with all of his conclusions, Campbell's erudition is astonishing, &amp; it's wonderful fun hearing him hold forth  on everything from Jesus &amp; Buddha to John Lennon &amp; Star Wars. This  is the best kind of book - one that sends you scuttling off to the library  in search of a dozen other titles. Probably the best general introduction  I've read on mythology, religion, &amp; their importance in our lives &amp;  culture.	2000-06-12

Allusive, witty, and wildly imaginative, this is  one of the best fantasy novels I've in a while. Is it THE best? No, that  honor still has to go to The Lord Of The Rings. Is Gaiman capable, with a  little more practice, of writing something that good? Uh, look out,  Mr.Tolkien...	2000-05-22

I would direct you first to Psychotic Reactions And Carburetor Dung, an excellent anthology of Lester's work. If you enjoy that, you will certainly  want to read Mr. DeRogatis' fine book &amp; learn about the man behind the  writing. As one of my fellow customer reviewers said, let's hope this  spearheads a revival in interest in Lester: he was a superlative writer  whose work deserves to be more widely read.	2000-05-15

This book certainly isn't for everyone, but for anyone interested in post-war popular music, and definitely for Who/Townshend  fans, it's worth taking a look at.  Smith's academic presentation may be a  bit cumbersome at times, but generally his adherance to a narrative  structure and even-handed presentation of Pete's oeuvre wins the day.   &quot;No other artist in history of popular music has achieved the artistic  scope of Pete Townshend's career,&quot; Mr. Smith concludes.  Amen to that.	1999-12-08
