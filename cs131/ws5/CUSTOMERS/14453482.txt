If you were in hopes of an intriguing Scarecrow vs. Batman storyline, this book will partially disappoint you.   <br /> <br />   Batman confronts two maddened thugs who become superhumanly strong after coming in contact with fear toxin.  Soon after, a scarecrow monster of Goliath proportions begins threatening organized crime.  All the while, Penguin is sitting back, sharpening his beak.   <br /> <br />   What is the mysterious new \\"Scarebeast?\\"  That is the new mystery Batman must solve.  The answer to the mystery is a bit surprising.  To earn that answer, Batman must subdue a seemingly unstoppable monster.   <br /> <br />  This is a fairly good storyline.  However, I offer the warning that this is not, in the main, a Scarecrow story.  It is a plot that highlights the Penguin as shooting for a criminal takeover of Gotham after \\"No Mans Land.\\"	2005-09-22

Also in the back story, Torque (Dudley Soames) and Nite-wing are planning a prison break for their ultimate revenge.   <br /> <br />   Dick is finally given a real challenge in the form of Shrike.  Shrike is a person from Dick's past who knew him as Robin.  What ensues is a grudge match of epic proportions that nearly kills Nightwing.  He is finally facing a killer whose skills rival his own.   <br /> <br />   Dick finds himself spread out too thin as a guardian of a town that seems to spurn his protection (Bludhaven).  Even Blockbuster seems to be immortal.  Dick can't catch a break to save his life (literally!) <br /> <br />   The battle between Shrike and Nightwing as well as the battle between Shrike and Desmond's goons (in other words, all the Shrike fight scenes) make this volume worth it.	2005-09-19

He just recites nursery rhymes and randomly sprays people with fear gas.  He is not a calculating, sociopathic madman with grand ambition.  I believe the latter should define the Scarecrow character.  That is what he was for nearly forty years.  This collection shows how well the Scarecrow character can be written if you make him a serious threat.<br /><br />  I only disliked two stories; \\"Joker vs. Scarecrow\\" and the story at the very end that was a short from a recent \\"Gotham Knights.\\"  The reason I disliked the second was because it was so short and felt like it was filler.  Nonetheless, there is some redemptive dialogue between Bruce and his bodyguard at the end.<br /><br />  Scarecrow has really been dealt a blow.  Once he seemed capable of implementing impressive plans as he stood on his own as a villain.  Lately he has spent too much time on someone else's puppet strings.  This collection will remind you of what a resourceful, clever, and diabolical villain the Scarecrow really is.	2005-09-19

Batman has been moving from what I would have called \\"self-contained\\" storylines to some type of \\"expanding\\" storylines.  Let me explain what I mean.   <br /> <br />\\"Self-contained storyline:\\"  typically a story told within four to six issues of the same comic.  One storyline might run from Batman #300-#306, for example.   <br /> <br />\\"Expanding\\" storyline:  A story is much more complex, spanning several issues of several different comic titles.  You read one part in Batman, finish in an issue of Robin several months later.  NO MAN'S LAND, Knightfall, and Contagion are examples of such a storyline where multiple characters are involved.  These type of storylines are in-depth.  Batman stories seem to be moving in this direction. <br /> <br />However, \\"War Drums\\" has some self-contained storylines, including Batman pursuing kidnappers, a mystery at a new factory, and an encroaching gang war.  What I find interesting is that in War Drums you see a combination of the two storyline types mentioned above.   <br /> <br />You get the satisfaction of seeing one plot unfurl and complete itself.  At the same time, you see a bigger picture developing around the self-contained storylines.  The kidnapping, factory mishap, and scuffles that are resolved are all episodes pointing to a bigger trend in Gotham.   <br /> <br />The work seen here, however, leads up to \\"War Games,\\" which looks interesting.  I hope the comics writers are learning that we are tired of following five or six titles just to get one good story.  On this front, \\"War Drums\\" looks promising.   <br /> <br />	2005-09-11

I am not one of those.  Even if I was, \\"Gothic\\" would have probably changed my mind.   <br /> <br />   Batman is drawn to a place from his past when men are murdered in a chapel.  From this trail of destruction Batman is led to confront a terrifying evil that has existed for nearly 300 years.   <br /> <br />   Batman is himself the stuff of many legends and superstitions.  He preys on the fear of criminals that he might be some monster or demon.  How will he fare when he faces a being that is worthy of such fear?   <br /> <br />   Batman \\"Gothic\\" is actually an intriguing piece that is inspired by literary greats like \\"Faust.\\"  Morrison's title is very appropriate and for once, I actually enjoyed the foreword that explained the reasoning behind the storyline.  This is good stuff.	2005-09-03

Each page exudes such intriguing detail and captivating motion that your eyes are drawn to each page.  The characters come to life; it is as though you can see the grief that contorts Batman's face as he battles the evils that killed his parents.   <br />  <br />   Paul Dini is the primary figure behind \\"Batman:  The Animated Series.\\"  To me, that legacy of excellence has successfully been carried over to \\"Batman:  War on Crime.\\"  The book is not as long as a graphic novel, and twice as large.  The artwork, done by Alex Ross, is the show-stealing feature of this work, however.   <br /> <br />   I believe it was Alex Ross who wrote some of the Marvel comics titled \\"Marvels.\\"  The art in these books was so gripping that I have often just gone through the book again to look at the pictures.   <br /> <br />   Like any great literary work, Ross and Dini personify the elements of humanity that the Batman embodies:  fear, guilt, loneliness, and grief.  \\"Batman:  War on Crime\\" is a wise investment for any fan of Batman.	2005-09-03

He does a good job of debunking the myth that faithfulness to the Bible's doctrine is equivalent to intellectual decay.   <br /> <br />   Actually, Davis is engaged with considerable empirical research.  He shows a side of scientific development and insight that is often deleted from media outlets because it seems to confirm the truth of Scripture.   <br /> <br />   Davis weighs in on issues that are extremely difficult.  However, his formula for discerning the best ethical choice is straightforward and effective.  The Scriptures take their rightful place as the central ethical standard for Evangelical Ethics.  An investigation into scientific development, Biblical scholarship, and changing societal mores together yields a thorough investigation of some of the toughest issues of our day, including poverty, sexuality, and abortion.   <br /> <br />   Davis is a great inheritor of the legacy of Machen and other Evangelicals that saw the doctrines of Christianity as timeless truths that could be repeatedly proven in the practical matters of everyday life.  This is a great book.	2005-08-27
US	14453482	R2LD26QZMSAKQT	1401202411	279056213	Batman in the Eighties	Books	4	12	13	N	Y	a good collection	Batman in the 80's contains stories I grew up reading in the comics.  So many of the storylines from the late 70's and early 80's went on to inspire episodes of \\"Batman:  The Animated Series,\\" a show so well-done that it still is the dominant influence in my image of the Dark Knight.  This Batman seems to walk the tightrope well.  He is both a menacing and mysterious figure, yet fueled by compassion rather than revenge.  I believe the Animated Series had so many episodes because it was based on the image of the character from the late 70's and early 80's- a complex but ultimately heroic figure.   <br /> <br />    Let me describe some of the stories so you can decide whether or not you would be interested.   <br /> <br />    There is one story with Man-Bat hiding in the Batcave and plotting the death of Bruce Wayne, who he believes is responsible for the death of his daughter.   <br /> <br />     There is a good Joker story where he throws his own sick, twisted, birthday party.   <br /> <br />     One of my favorites, the Penguin, makes an appearance. He wants to prove that he is the equal of the Joker, Two-Face, or Riddler.  <br /> <br />     Also, there is a story about a criminal Batman called \\"The Wrath,\\" which is set in a parallel universe.   <br /> <br />     And finally there is a story involving the Scarecrow.  Scarecrow was actually such a big Batman villain in the 80's that he landed a spot on the \\"Legion of Doom\\" in \\"Superfriends.\\"  Perhaps he became more popular because comic writing had taken a more psychological approach that suited the character well.   <br /> <br />    There are some good stories here.  However, to warn you out there who have other graphic novels, there are repeats from \\"Greatest Joker Stories Ever Told\\" and \\"Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told.\\"  Still, it is a good collection.	2005-08-23

Some points of interest:  The strange character \\"Nite-wing\\" is nearly killed, and Nightwing rushes to the rescue.  One of Dick's earliest foes in the series has returned with a vengeance and an interesting new m.o.  <br /> <br />     What I like about the Nightwing series is rather straightforward.  It has a great, action-packed style of art and dialogue.  So much happens on every page.  If you aren't careful, you'll miss something.   <br /> <br />     Second, Nightwing is so different from Batman, despite their similar skills, methods, and talents.  Dixon has kept part of the optimism and positive social adjustment that makes Grayson a more identifiable character.  Part of the draw of Batman is that he is so mysterious.  Dick Grayson says in this installment to Robin:  \\"You, Alfred, and I have been close to him for years, yet still we seem to know hardly anything about him.\\"   <br /> <br />     Nightwing, on the other hand, is a far less enigmatic figure that takes Robin under his wing.  Every parent wants better for their kids than what they got.  Batman wanted better for Dick, and Dick wants better for Tim.  Nightwing is kind of like a combination big brother/father figure to Robin.  Their cameraderie is exemplified in the scene where they are doing combat training with blindfolds.   <br /> <br />    I really like the creative team for this magazine.  The books are just the issues of the comic added together.  Nonetheless, Nightwing is a genuine crowd pleaser.	2005-08-23

Sadly, I believe some of us ministers have forgotten that preachers' most effective tools are words.  A well spoken word can encourage repentance, or lift up a broken heart.  A poorly spoken word is a tragedy that may never be reclaimed.   <br /> <br />     I especially like the \\"God and Passion\\" article on Dostoyevsky.  This book has convinced me to check out a copy of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" from the library.  My one complaint is that no one wrote about CS Lewis, one of the writers that helped spark my own conversion and calling to Christendom.   <br /> <br />    However, this is a great primer for someone who wants to learn more about literary classics written by Christian authors.  Several great authors are covered here, some of whom I've read and some I haven't.  The writers of the essays describe, as the title of the book explains, how their predecessors shaped their own vision of writing and what they believe to be some of the important themes in early Christian classics.   <br /> <br />   I have learned from this book that: The written word is so powerful that lives have been lost and kingdoms fallen on the twisting precipices carved out by a seemingly innocuous set of nouns,verbs, and adjectives.  Yet those sentences yield to the yearnings of the soul, and in the end will also be what was in the beginning; the word.   <br /> <br />    This book is great.	2005-08-18

I like manga.  The art is so fantastic, the characters so detailed.  Asamiya is a fantastic artist.  He draws the Joker so well.  By giving the Joker a wild smile, yet with grimacing eyebrows, Asamiya portrays the character as a homocidal lunatic masquerading as some harmless clown.  That is exactly what the Joker is.  When Manga doesn't always connect with dialogue, the amazing thing is that the art itself is a form of characterization.   <br /> <br />   The eyes, the lines, the perspective, are all elements of drawing that can add an effective element to creating a character.  In a comic book, you have visual aids to help you picture the character.  In America, I think the dialogue and writing are superior; however in Japan there is little question that the art is superior.  The characters, by their mere appearance on the page, lend some insight into what lies beneath the character in a metaphysical sense.  That is how good the best manga art is.    <br /> <br />    However, the story itself is a very interesting, and creative one.  Someone has the ability to recreate Batman villains at the genetic level.  Due to the havoc it wreaks on the body, however, the \\"villain\\" mummifies within two or three days.  Who is behind this strange development?   <br /> <br />    Someone who is utterly obsessed with Batman!  Someone who takes the saying \\"imitation is the sincerest form of flattery\\" to the next level:  He wants to become Batman! <br /> <br />    The art is just so well done, and the story is pretty darn good, too.  If you want to experience Batman in a new, and interesting way, and you are a manga fan, I recommend this book.	2005-08-15

Much like \\"Knightfall,\\" one must endure a period of helplessness with Bruce.  As someone whose confidence is so important, because he lacks powers, Batman has lost his central strength.   <br /> <br />     The story begins as Batman has trailed kidnappers to an abandoned mine. In a heavy rain, the mine is flooding, with a little girl trapped inside.  Frantically searching, Batman finds the girl behind a rock.  He moves each rock and finally approaches the largest, nearly a boulder.  The space behind the rock is filling and in desperation, Batman cannot move it.  Before his very eyes, the spark of innocence is extinguished as the girl succumbs to death.   <br /> <br />     Though Batman has had his back broken, been injected with the world's deadliest poisons, and endured psychological torture, watching the girl die struck him still more deeply.  Assuming the guilt that belongs to the kidnappers, Batman tries to gain strength.  The father of the girl is a pharmacist who has perfected the ultimate \\"performance enhancer.\\"   <br /> <br />     Batman accepts the package of pills and finally decides to take them.  What Batman doesn't know, however, is that the drugs harbor addictive properties.  The rest of the story is primarily a struggle within Batman to beat a foreign substance that threatens to take over his own body and mind.   <br /> <br />     The struggle within is masterfully told, and Batman has never seen so desperate an hour.  The reason I don't give a five is twofold:  First, Batman putting it in his system without analyzing it at the Batcave?  The writers explain that some, but still it is unbelievable.  Second:  He has his utility belt, and I am surprised nothing in there would have been useful to save the girl.   <br /> <br />     However, the death of the girl is the first necessary tragedy in a string of brutal losses and sorrowful events.  This is one of the saddest Batman stories I have ever read, with the possible exception of \\"Night Cries.\\"  Can Batman conquer demons when they are his own?   <br /> <br />	2005-08-15

Batman and Spiderman team up to take on villains Kingpin and Ras Al Ghul.  I believe that Dematteis does a superb job with all four characters.  Spider-man is a wise-cracking but compassionate man who has an overwhelming sense of responsibility.  Batman is a dark, menacing figure with no super-powers.  Perhaps the only reason he teams up with Spiderman well is because he identifies with Spidey's strong sense of responsibility.  Kingpin is a scheming, criminal mastermind, which lends itself to a good plot twist near the end of the story.  Ras Al Ghul is a self-proclaimed visionary and savior who believes the path to salvation involves rebuilding the world after nearly wiping out its population.<br /><br />  The Demon plans once again to upset the balance of the earth.  He approaches Wilson Fisk, believing that the Kingpin can finally help him realize his ideal.  However, betrayal is very likely with these two.

Batman has accumulated data of how to incapacitate or even kill each Justice League member.  Ras Al Ghul has stolen this information and is using it.  The League is ambushed with cold, calculating efficiency.        Al Ghul has decided that instead of global flood, he will create a language barrier.  He has created a device that makes all communication unintelligible.  Without language, the human race will kill one another in chaos.          After a close aversion to crisis, the JLA must decide whether or not Batman will remain a member.          I think that Batman is well within his rights; here are people with god-like powers that could conquer the world if they so desire.  He is without powers; were he required to fight one of them he would easily be killed.  He needs an upper hand.          This storyline points out that the JLA has had, to some degree, a \\"superpowers only\\" membership policy.  It is a sort of unwritten law, but this storyline uncovers the tension that exists between superheroes and ordinary humans.  Though he is very capable, Batman is still an ordinary human.  There is a constant uneasiness between Batman and Superman.            I got it mainly because Batman was the central character.  I was not disappointed.	2005-08-15

Moved to deep compassion, Bruce adopts the boy and trains him as a crimefighter.  Dick Grayson shows great potential and promise.   <br /> <br />   However, many have doubts.  Alfred fears that another boy has had his childhood stolen, and Commissioner Gordon heartily disapproves; what if the child is hurt?  Alfred, as the narrator of the story (great choice) relives the difficulties of raising Bruce.  Can Robin prove he is worthy of superhero status?   <br /> <br />   \\"Robin:  Year One\\" does a great job of showing the relationship between Alfred, Dick, and Bruce.  Alfred is the father of the two men, giving aid and support that make Batman and Robin possible.  Dixon does a magnificent job making it feel like a \\"family.\\"   <br /> <br />    Using contrast, Dixon portrays a brooding Batman whose darkness is brightened by the undying optimism and good cheer of Robin, the Boy Wonder.  While Bruce did not have many friends growing up, Dick is extremely well adjusted socially.  Together, one complements the other, and a truly dynamic duo is born.   <br /> <br />    However, like any family, there are moments of strife, tension, and sorrow.  Dixon paints such a believable and identifiable picture of the Robin character that readers will feel as Robin feels.  Can he prove that he is worthy?  Will he lose his childhood in a scramble for justice?   <br /> <br />    \\"Robin:  Year One\\" is one of the best Batman universe graphic novels out there.	2005-08-11

Venom hunts Spider-man in a deadly game of cat and mouse.  Venom knows that Peter Parker is the actual alter ego of Spider-man.   <br /> <br />    Venom believes Spider-man to be a ruthless manipulator that destroyed his media career.

The richest people in Gotham board themselves up and isolate themselves from the masses.  However, one of their member is already infected, and the decadent millionaires offer the city five million dollars to find a survivor so that an antidote can be made.           This novel is a \\"cross-over\\" style, it takes place in Batman, Robin, Huntress, Azrael, and Catwoman titles.  Each of the heroes approaches the problem as best they can.  They reach a new height of desperation when one of their own is infected.          One of the ways I am the most impressed is how Chuck Dixon has developed the Robin character.  Tim Drake is a great Robin, with a sense of humor and an even stronger sense of justice.  The way he develops Robin into a selfless hero should silence most of the remaining critics that say Robin is only an offshoot of Batman, or a nuisance.  When Robin is facing death and Catwoman bends over to touch him, he tells her to leave him alone, he will not stand by and watch people die.  Even Catwoman, the irreverent spoil of the Batman squad, looks at Drake with awe and respect.          One complaint:  the plot is a little choppy.  They spend most of the time going one direction, only to find their efforts vain.  The transition from one course of action (finding a survivor to get a cure) to the other (deriving an antidote from a strange, esoteric text from Azrael) seems a bit too inconsistent.        Overall, however, this book is a true test of the characters that watch over Gotham.  Will they give in to the despair and fear like the other Gothamites?  Even Nightwing, the most optimistic of the characters, thought Gotham to be doomed.  \\"Contagion\\" is an interesting storyline that pits Batman and crew against a destructive, invisible force that cannot be conquered by orthodox means.	2005-08-04

And though we do not see eye-to-eye on some things, I like the guy.  So there may be some bias here.   <br /> <br />    Anyway, this book is exactly what you would expect, a dictionary that explains most of the important terms, organizations, events, and doctrines that have influenced the history of the Baptist denomination.   <br /> <br />    As a Baptist minister, I ordered this book to deepen my understanding of Baptist history, and second, to use as a reference when teaching my congregation about Baptist history.  It is a useful book because when you want to approach your congregation, it never hurts to know what the Baptists before you did in a tight spot.   <br /> <br />    I find this book fairly useful, and would recommend it to a fellow Baptist, or someone who has a Baptist friend he or she wants to understand better.  In this one denomination there are foot-washers, Calvinists, Arminians, Evangelicals, black, white, native American, increasing Hispanic and Korean congregations, independent, free-will, missionary, Southern, Northern, and yes, Billy Graham.  Our faith, thankfully, has appealed to many people in its roughly 393 years of history.  Thus understanding us is not as easy as it seems.

That may deter you from buying the book because they are two of the better stories in here.  Also if you have \\"Tales of the Demon,\\" there is one of those stories in here.  However, this is an anthology that stands on its own in terms of interest.  I believe that the 70's was a crucial turning point in Batman history that marked a bit of a Renaissance. <br />     <br />    There Is No Hope in Crime Alley- Truly one of the \\"Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told,\\" Batman revisits the moment of his greatest agony as he visits his parent's place of death. Also \\"Death Flies the Haunted Sky\\" is another story from the \\"Greatest...Told\\" Anthology. <br /> <br />     Now for what I truly disliked in the book:  \\"Invader From Hell\\" and \\"Marriage:Impossible.\\"  I have this theory that there are no bad Batman stories out there in the comic world; these come dangerously close to disproving that theory.  \\"Marriage Impossible\\" is like one of those strange horror movies of the seventies that they make fun of on Mad TV.  \\"Invader\\" is not much better, pitting Batgirl and Robin against Benedict Arnold.   <br /> <br />     However, the rest of the stories in this book summarize the 70's era pretty well.  The comic is recovering from the camp that dominated in the 50's and 60's, as the Detective is revived, again trying to thwart the criminal mind.  For instance, Vow From the Grave- is a good episodic murder mystery,  and inspired one of the episodes of the \\"Animated Series\\" years later.  \\"Ticket to Tragedy\\" is kind of like Batman meets \\"Murder on the Orient Express.\\"  So the 1970's saw a reformation of the detective element of the genre. <br /> <br />    Last, \\"Daughter of the Demon\\" is the introduction of one of the most interesting Batman characters yet, Ras Al Ghul.  If you want a good anthology, \\"Tales of the Demon\\" highlights several Batman/Al Ghul clashes.  Ghul was first in the comics in the 70's. <br /> <br />    There is a good Joker story, and overall, the stories are good.  So if you like the sound of the above stories, this book may be for you.	2005-08-03

Nightwing, with much hard work, has finally made Bludhaven his own; Nightwing is now to Bludhaven what Batman is to Gotham.  Dick Grayson is the protector of the few innocents that still grace the streets of Bludhaven, an urban cesspool that makes Gotham look like a good site for a Girl Scout meeting. <br /> <br />   Superman makes an appearance early in the book, teaming up with Nightwing to pay Roland Desmond a visit.  The relationship between Nightwing and Superman is very different from that of Batman and Superman.  As one reviewer has already aptly pointed out, both Batman and Robin teamed up with Superman quite often.  Robin, Dick Grayson, developed a stronger trust of Superman and invites his help.  Batman views Superman as a hindrance.   <br /> <br />    One of my favorite characters is the blond-headed \\"Nitewing\\" who busts up criminals in true vigilante fashion.  He is utterly obsessed and I eagerly await new books that reveal the reason he battles crime so fiercely.  How will Chief Redhorn utilize the aid of this Nite-wing?  And what will happen when the two Nightwings finally confront one another?   <br /> <br />    Another good series of plot twists, and a crime boss who refuses to fade away, the Nightwing series shows great promise.  I've liked both books I've ordered so far.	2005-08-03

Set in the feudal era where destiny seemed so ingrained, one man bravely swung his sword to ensure his own freedom.  Guts is the one man with enough power and determination to challenge the transcendental entities, the Godhand, that impose their sordid sick will on humanity.          Never have I so desperately cheered on a protagonist as he took on insurmountable odds with the careless, berserking rage that carried the weight of an entire era.          In vol. 8, a Guts much reformed by the heat of battle again challenges Griffith, this time for his freedom from the Hawks.  Despite the successes of the Hawks and Griffith's seemingly unstoppable campaign to the Midland throne, Guts wants to swing his sword freely.  The life of a mercernary is all he has ever known.  Life as a noble simply could not fulfill his own dreams and sense of purpose.          Also, Guts can no longer stand being the subordinate of Griffith, Guts battles to claim equality with Griffith, the man ordained by the Behelit (The Egg of the one who would be king).  In a discussion with his closest companion Judeau, he realizes that he must become his own man.  Judeau, seeing that he might attain this dream, does not attempt to convince him to stay.           However, Judeau does warn Guts that Caska, the woman he respects and probably loves, would not leave the Hawks.  Guts revealed that in her eyes, he cannot compare with Griffith.  However, if he were to make a name for himself, maybe she would look his way.  Either way, it is time for Guts to leave the Hawks.        \\"Berserk\\" is the proof positive that the comic book is one of the greatest products of the arts, combining two mediums:  drawing and storytelling.  I await the next volume with great anticipation, and even more so the one after that in which Guts pursues the demonized Griffith.  If you like anime or manga, do not pass this by!	2005-08-03

Two people are talking about the ideas of moral relativism and moral absolutism.  The \\"Isa\\" character is a Muslim who believes that there are moral absolutes.  The \\"Libby\\" character is a feminist who believes there are not moral absolutes.         Moral absolutism is a position in which it is believed that the whole of humanity is obligated to act in certain ways.  Moral relativism is the position in which there are no moral universals, or principles that compel all people.        Some of the philosophical concepts that are of interest in this book include:  1) There is a definite connection between epistemology and ethics.  If we cannot know moral truths, we should not be expected to live by them.  2)  Are the differences in cultures around the world a proof of moral relativism?  3)  Which one is more oppressive politically and socially when it becomes the majority paradigm:  relativism or absolutism?  4)  Can a relativist \\"preach\\" about, or attempt to spread, the idea of moral relativism without compromising their ideals?         I couldn't put the book down once I had started it.  It is a great review of the \\"Great Conversation.\\"  Like any Kreeft book, you will read about concepts explored in all the big philosophical names: Aristotle, Kieerkegard, etc.  I also think he puts forth a convincing argument as to why moral absolutism is true.	2005-08-03

Ras Al Ghul is one of the best Batman villains out there.  He knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman, he is the leader of powerful assassin groups, and he can be revived from death or serious injury by using his \\"Lazarus Pit,\\" implying that he may outlive Batman.  However, Ras would actually like Batman to replace him and take his beautiful daughter Talia as his wife.  So the relationship between the two is very complex.   <br /> <br />     Batman realizes that in terms of strategy, power, and longevity, Ras may be his greatest challenge.  Threatening worldwide destruction, Ras is a villain whose scope of tyranny oustretches even the Joker's.  Batman desperately seeks to bring Ras to justice.  Not even his affection for Talia can deter him from this single goal.   <br /> <br />     The stories depict two men who conceive justice in extremely different ways.  This book chronicles the personal war that wages on between two men who are strikingly similar and yet worlds apart.  If you want to read the history of one of the greatest Batman villains, this is for you.	2005-08-03

I am a fan of both Kreeft and Pascal.  I think some other reviewers have hit on many of the same reasons I like this book, but here's my own take.<br /><br />  First of all, there was a philosophical movement in Europe at the turn of the 18th century called the Enlightenment.  No single wave of thought can take as much credit for influencing the modern world as the Enlightenment.  That movement was a tidal wave that swept up every major philosopher for the last three hundred years.  Pascal was one of the only thinkers not swept up in the powerful riptides of that \\"revolution.\\"  One of my favorite quotes in the book is that Enlightenment tries to do \\"life itself as a science.\\"  Yet Pascal knew that man was not the measure of all things, but a twisted contradiction of greatness and wretchedness.  Herein I believe, lies much of his insight; he is not a strict Enlightenment idealist.<br /><br />  Rather, Pascal is a philsophical and theological realist who brought his bluntness and passion to the fields not only of philosophy, but science and math.  Pascal was fortunate enough to brandish insights in all of these disciplines.  My favorite parts of his thought, however, correspond to his philosophy.<br /><br />  These insights were the \\"Pensees,\\" his thoughts.  I think every Christian should know \\"The Wager\\" argument by heart.  It is brilliant.  Everything to lose and everything to gain; life often revolves around the choices we make and the corresponding benefits or harms that result.<br /><br />  Pascal is almost what you get when you try to blend the strengths of Augustine and Aquinas; a passionate minister (Augustine) mixed with the masterful logic of the Summa (Aquinas) rolled into one neat package.  He was not a Cartesian dualist who saw mind and body as separate.  Rather, Pascal realized that heart and soul live in the same body, at odds with one another, yet neither ever totally conquering the other.<br /><br />  Also, Pascal is what I would have called in my college days as a philosopher a \\"non-dry\\" thinker.  That is, Pensees goes down a lot easier than Nichomachean Ethics because it is more accessible and heartfelt.  Argument is shrouded in vernacular expression, passion is not seen as antithetical to the cause of strengthening an already sound position.<br /><br />  I highly recommend this book, Kreeft has some good commentary that helps simplify the very complex \\"Thoughts/Pensees\\" of one of the most brilliant thinkers ever.losopher a \\"non-dry\\" thinker.

I know that its sheer size and sometimes its seeming unintelligibility can frustrate and even frighten many from trying to read all of it.  There are certain passages that I, too, feel uncomfortable tackling until I've done research. <br /> <br />   And that is precisely where this book comes in.  Kreeft identifies some of the historical, philosophical, and theological themes of each book in the Bible.  The guide has a chapter devoted to each book of the Bible, so the guide's organization is very straightforward and thus user-friendly.   <br /> <br />   Kreeft has the rare gift of translating the insights of deep and hard working scholarship into \\"layman's terms.\\"  He also offers excellent interpretations of some of the spiritual insights of the Wisdom literature (Job, Ecclesiastes, etc.).  He wrote a great book on Job, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon also worth checking out.   <br /> <br />    Furthermore, if you are a minister looking for sermon material that is expository, Kreeft is generally a very quoteworthy author.  I have quoted him in sermons to my congregation much to their delight.   <br /> <br />    In time, this book may prove to be one of Kreeft's most practical contributions to Christendom apart from his excellent works of apologetics.  The book is well-written and useful.	2005-08-01

He is not a killer, but a thief seeking a worthy rival in games of the mind. This collection honors and even re-establishes these definitive aspects of the character, as seen in the story \\"The Prison Puzzle.\\"   <br /> <br />   Two-Face is a man who feels betrayed by the law that he spent all his energy protecting and upholding.  He wonders if the only way to truly defeat crime is to commit crime.  Two personalities co-exist not at different times, but simultaneously.  He is constantly half-Jeckyll, half-Hyde.  Again, the stories in this collection highlight the important features of Two-Face down to his obsession with the flip of a coin.   <br /> <br />   Considering that these two are probably my favorite villains, especially after \\"The Long Halloween\\" and \\"Hush,\\" this anthology was well worth the price.	2005-08-01

The story also follows closely the ascent of Jim Gordon within the Gotham police force and the friendship that is established between Gordon and Batman.   <br /> <br />    In his haste to begin cleaning Gotham, Bruce jumps the gun and goes into the city armed only with his martial arts skills and a toboggan to parially shroud his identity.  He is stabbed and nearly killed.  He realizes that he needs to be more careful and methodical in his crusade to erase crime.   <br /> <br />    Meanwhile, a young cop named Gordon is transferred from Chicago to Gotham City.  Under the jurisdiction of a tyrannical, corrupt police commissioner and his lackeys, Gordon sacrifices his own well-being rather than his principles.   <br /> <br />    Each of the two men learn from their pain and losses and through their own development, continue down paths that eventually merge into one.  The book reaches a climax when it appears that the corrupt police force may destroy the Batman.   <br /> <br />    \\"Batman:  Year One\\" may well have inspired parts of the latest Batman movie, \\"Batman Begins.\\"  If you liked the movie, you will probably like the book.   <br /> <br />     Miller brings a level of determination to the Batman character that seems appropriate.  Despite setbacks, Batman does not relent in his passionate bid to bring justice to  <br />Gotham.  Through ingenuity and tenacity, Batman challenges the city's acquiescence to injustice.  I liked this book.	2005-07-20

Lewis wrote this book late in his life after he had experienced love with a colleague in writing.  He gives sound advice that I believe applies to a broader base than his usual Christian readership.  The four loves are:  Affection, Eros, Friendship, and Charity.  Each type of love has a chapter dedicated to a fuller explanation.   <br /> <br />      My favorite section is the one he wrote on Friendship.  I think he is honest about limitations we place on who becomes our friends.  Many believe any two people can become good friends, when in reality, this is just not so.  Friends are people who share some vision or passion in life.  That vision or passion is the cement of the common bond.  Lewis had deep friendships with interesting people, such as Tolkien.  He even elaborates on his own experiences with such companions. <br /> <br />      Charity is the true form of love.  Charity is the deepest form of giving our feeling, freedom, and even our very selves, to each other and finally, to God, whom Lewis calls \\"Love Himself.\\"  There is wisdom in his admonition that love is not easy or cheap.  Work, loss, and sacrifice often accompany the application of true love, which is charity.   <br /> <br />     Unlike other works, such as \\"Miracles\\" or \\"Mere Christianity\\" where logic sets the primary pace, \\"The Four Loves\\" is a book where Lewis brings much of his experience to light.  This is not, however, to say that Lewis does not apply logic to experience.  Rather, Lewis uses logic to makes sense of experiences in his past to try and uncover truths about love.   <br /> <br />     In writing about love, Lewis articulates some significant moral, social, and psychological truths.  Most importantly, he shows that love itself is not God.  Love exalted to divinity becomes a \\"demon,\\" as he quotes one of his contemporaries.  Love is only a part of the greatness of our complex lives, not the full of it.  \\"The Four Loves\\" is another insightful masterpiece by C.S. Lewis.	2005-07-14

He is the third Robin and feels a strong need to prove himself.  In his first adventures he fights and is even trained by, one of the world's best martial artists, Lady Shiva.  Robin races to defeat a new threat more powerful than previous enemies.  The terrorist Ghost Dragons have captured a sample of old bubonic plague and plan to unleash it, killing millions. <br /> <br />     I really like Tim Drake as Robin because he does exactly what Dixon proposes:  he \\"complements\\" Batman.  He is not reckless and brash like Jason; if anything he lacks confidence.  However, he is arguably the best detective of the three Robins, and incredibly clever.   <br /> <br />     His determination is what really impresses me.  When he is training and feels so helplessly alone, he doesn't give in.  That is a true hero.  I also have always liked it when Nightwing and Robin get together.  They just have such a great brotherly relationship.  Chuck Dixon writes both characters really well.   <br /> <br />     Chuck Dixon is really great with these \\"coming-of-age\\" stories.  Robin:  \\"A Hero Reborn\\" is the story of one young man's journey to become a hero.  He is not so arrogant to believe that he is destined to be great, and he acknowledges humbly the dangers of the world.  Despite his fear, he bravely treads onward.  Tim embodies our own struggles with inadequacy and anxiety and we cheer him on as he bests each new trial.  This strong empathy between reader and protagonist is reason enough to check out this book for anyone curious to the motivations of a \\"Boy Wonder.\\"	2005-07-14

Anymore the way the comic world operates you have to subscribe to Robin, Nightwing, and Batgirl just to know what is going on with Batman anyway.   <br /> <br />   Nightwing has a different personality from his mentor.  Dixon does a good job establishing that he has a sense of humor.  For example, a thug cuts Nightwing's ponytail:  \\"I was getting sick of it anyway.\\"  Batman would just punch the guy harder than the other thugs.  Nightwing is no longer under the shadow of his mentor.   <br /> <br />   \\"A Knight in Bludhaven\\" describes the transition for Dick Grayson as he becomes a crime fighter in a city that is even more corrupt than Gotham:  Bludhaven.  There are no Alfreds, Jim Gordons, or Barbara Gordons in this urban cesspool.   <br /> <br />    Nightwing becomes the protector of Bludhaven as Batman is the protector of Gotham.  Nightwing has finally come of age to call his own shots.  He is a different character with a different set of enemies.  In fact, the secret Bludhaven crime boss is a resurrected baddie from Dick's past.   <br /> <br />    This is a great coming-of-age story that shows that Grayson is ready for the big-time.  If this is what Nightwing is like, I'll probably get a few more of his storylines.  Good stuff.	2005-07-12

Batman is pushed into the world of child abuse when the abusers are killed methodically by an emerging serial killer.   <br />  <br />    There is a moment of desperation when Batman realizes even he cannot prevent all the injustice and suffering in the world.  At that moment, the normally cold and calculating appearance of Batman withers for just a moment to reveal the young boy who made a compassionate vow on the eve of his parents' murder.   <br /> <br />     How to handle child abuse?  Unlike robbery or homicide, it is hard to prove and difficult to prosecute.  Even Batman's stomach turns as he must occasionally watch from the shadows helplessly like the little children who are abused.  If you want something that is more about the action, this may not be it for you; it is a tragedy and also about a difficult subject.   <br /> <br />     The art is gripping.  I think it is really good for establishing a depressing mood which is appropriate for the tragedies that unfold in the story.  Just be careful with this one, it is a heartbreaking story.	2005-07-12

Only this murderer is more deplorable, because the victims are cops.   <br />    <br />    Batman begins to investigate while trying to keep a full-blown war from escalating between the organized crime succeeding Falcone and the super-villains (Joker, Freeze, and perhaps my favorite, Two-Face).   <br />    <br />    In the first novel, a more in-depth origin of Two-Face enthralls the reader.  In the second, Dick Grayson is introduced into the life of Bruce Wayne and it is interesting to watch how Grayson slowly gains the respect of Batman through aiding him in his detective work.  While I don't necessarily agree that \\"Batman needs a Robin,\\" I think Loeb and crew put an interesting spin on the \\"Dynamic Duo.\\"   <br />    <br />     \\"Dark Victory\\" is a good followup to \\"The Long Halloween.\\"  I recommend both as a package deal.	2005-07-02

When most of the rest of the Justice League have become little more than government puppets, Batman stands alone against the tides of change that threaten to corrupt the superhero world.  The premise of this book is that the Batman has reached the dreaded obstacle of old age (55, I think) and decides to once again don the cowl.  In this guise he battles Two-face, the Joker, the leader of a street gang, and yes, even Superman!        If you have a certain affinity for the Batman character and mythos, you might be shaken a bit by this book.  This is a book that shows Batman when he has to pull out all the stops.  Criminals have overrun Gotham, and he just cannot sit by and watch this happen.  \\"It is like watching him (Thomas Wayne) get shot all over again,\\"  Bruce comments as he once again brings an intensity to Gotham that only Batman can deliver.  Justice must be served.         \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" is a powerfully driven character study of a man who doesn't need flight, super-strength, or laser vision.  Miller taps into the real reason Batman is great: people look at a Wonder Woman, Superman, or Flash, and think to themselves:  \\"I could never do that,  I guess I can't be a hero.\\"  On the other hand, people look at Batman, and are confronted with their own mediocrity;  Batman is just like us, he bleeds and dies.  Despite that, he brings only courage, conviction, and unbridled ingenuity to the table, and he can walk among the great ones.  People look at the Batman and say, \\"maybe, just maybe-.\\"  Look at Jim Gordon, Robin, Nightwing, Catwoman, Oracle, and many policemen.  Batman's raw human heroism is the greatest of all inspirations to come from the Justice League.  His truest power is infectious bravery.  Just knowing him as an ally makes you feel invincible.          Though it may be a bit cynical, Miller also exposes the dark underbelly of humanity that respects only power and those who wield it.  One of Batman's greatest achievements is to show by example to such criminals that the only meaningful power is the one tempered by compassion.  Many street criminals reform not out of coercion, but out of inspiration for who Batman is and what he symbolizes.  The book does a great job in explaining the iconic greatness of Batman.	2005-07-02

It is a simple tale of revenge and does not measure up to the suspense that the first Reaper, a more menacing figure, creates.  While this book is a fairly good read, I believe it does not ultimately do justice to the first Reaper.  Essentially a two-bit crook hijacks the costume from the morgue and continues the campaign against Batman.  It lacks the intensity of the bitter rivalry between two men.  However it does provoke one interesting question:  \\"How could one person who doesn't know me hate me so much?\\" Asks the Batman.  There is some redemption in that irony.  Also, that redemption makes for good closure.	2005-07-02

Lewis and Sigmund Freud Debate God, Love, Sex, and the Meaning of Life	Books	5	8	10	N	Y	the philosophy and pyschology of belief and unbelief	I must admit when I realized that this book was written by someone who has spent much of their life doing psychology, I was unfairly prejudiced and skeptical of the book's quality.  I read ahead anyway, and am very glad I did!<br /><br />  In our society, we create several dichotomies into which we think people should fit:  conservative vs. liberal, pro-life vs. pro-choice, fat or thin, intelligent or foolish.  Yet in looking at all these dichotomies we miss what is arguably the most important of all.  Both C.S. Lewis and Freud believed that the most meaningul distinction was that of belief or unbelief.  Freud represents skepticism, and Lewis what Nicholi calls the \\"spiritual\\" worldview.<br /><br />  The purpose of the book, then, is to compare the lives of two men.  Freud, an adamant unbeliever in anything save the immediate empiricism of science, based most of his philosopical views, mindset, and lifestyle on the absence of a real God.  Lewis, an atheist turned convert to Christianity, defined all his life as a function or consequence of the reality of God.<br /><br />  The book has biographical, psychological, and philosophical content.  In its interdisiplinary nature it studies the issue of belief vs. unbelief in a profoundly deep manner.  Some of the questions the book addresses are:<br /><br />-Is there a God?<br /><br />-What is God like?<br /><br />-What is the role of science?<br /><br />-How can different philosophical stances effect the mind and life of an individual?  (i.e. how did Freud and Lewis face their own death, live their view of love and friendship, and ponder the nature of morality)<br /><br />-How did each man actually live?

There are stories featuring the Joker, Clayface, Dr. Phosphorus, Hugo Strange, and the Penguin.  Reading the book shows that this was one of the high points of the Batman series.   <br />   Also this book contains the classic Joker story, \\"The Laughing Fish.\\"  This is one of the best Batman plots of all time.  The Joker commits one of the most unusual and inventive crimes of all.   <br />   This also explains how Hugo Strange came to know the identity of Batman.  Some of the episodes of \\"Batman:  the Animated Series\\" are inspired from these comics.  If you are a fan of the animated show from the '90s, you'll also appreciate these comics, the inspiration for some of those cartoons.  On a side note, the animated series is one of the greatest works of television, fictional or non-fictional, I have ever experienced.  The comics from the \\"Strange Apparitions\\" era provided much of its inspiration. <br />   So this is a good sampling of the Batman and his exploits.	2005-06-27

Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and other villains are being manipulated by an even greater threat.  Is it the man in bandages that watches the conflagration from a safe distance and a sadistic smile?  Or is it even more complex than that?          It is as though all the characters in the Batman universe are players on a giant chess board and one mastermind is manipulating them all.  Worse yet, this manipulator appears to know that Bruce Wayne is Batman.          This is the beginning of the mystery, and I would encourage you to buy both volumes of \\"Hush\\" because the second volume is thicker than the first and contains the climax and resolution that the events set forth in vol. 1 demand.  Just so you'll know, if you aren't a big Catwoman fan, let me warn you up front that she is a big player in this storyline.          The plot to these two volumes is rich and are worthy of the World's Greatest Detective. Villains seem to attack the Batman in new ways, shirking their once seemingly indomitable addiction to gimmicks.  A plot beyond the scope of even Batman threatens to consume him.  The plot is unpredictable because you are not sure which direction Batman will be led by this mysterious \\"Pied Piper.\\"  The art also is some of the best I've ever seen, with the backgrounds and characters springing to life.	2005-06-27

In the first, Bruce Wayne begins to get serious with a woman while the Scarecrow terrorizes Gotham.  In the second, the Mad Hatter is up to his usual schemes.  Finally, the third is a Batman version of the Dickens classic, \\"A Christmas Carol.\\"   <br />   My favorite is the third story.  The tale is woven so that it becomes obvious to Bruce that the Batman can sometimes be his own worse enemy.  I just love the way a night of strange visions can change even the most uncompromising character.  The thing I always loved about the whole \\"Scrooge\\" archetype is that the presence of three spirits, a mystical and supernatural event, takes back seat to an even more incredible event; the redemption of a wayward human heart.  So I am a sucker for the whole \\"Christmas Carol\\" mentality. <br />    The thing about the Mad Hatter is I believe they've taken the character a bit far; he went from a dreaming schemer to a delusional psychotic.  He once was just an eccentric criminal whose sense of reality was a bit distorted; now he is a homocidal maniac. I don't, in general, like the way they write the Jervis Tetch character nowadays.  <br />    Nonetheless, the third story is good and the first one is good enough to warrant a good recommendation for this book.	2005-06-27
US	14453482	RF6YPTBSV991T	1563894696	431283596	Batman: The Long Halloween	Books	5	2	4	N	Y	Arguably the best Batman graphic novel	\\"Batman:  The Long Halloween\\" is a must-have for any fan of the Dark Knight.  This is a graphic novel in the truest sense.   <br />It is graphic in the sense that the art uses contrast and darkness masterfully to create an atmosphere that is worthy of Gotham City.  The shadows seem to hide potent secrets.  It is a novel in that the author uses all the great tools: characterization, irony, ambiguity (when appropriate), and a conflict to serve as a backdrop for the ongoing story.  The moral dilemmas that face the characters (how far should one go to stop crime?), the eagerness of certain characters to please their father figures, are all well written aspects of this story. <br /> <br />    The story begins with an alliance of Jim Gordon, Batman, and Harvey Dent.  This story takes place before the introduction of Two-Face into the storyline.  All three agree to take down a crime boss, Falcone.  Gordon makes it clear that nothing illegal is to take place.   <br /> <br />    Along the way, however, a mysterious killer known only as \\"Holiday\\" begins to kill members of organized crime and the Batman begins to doubt the alliance and working with others in general.  The city erupts into a frenzy of fear and suspicion.  Why, though, are only members of organized crime dying? <br /> <br />    The story follows the lives of three men:  Harvey Dent, Jim Gordon, and Bruce Wayne/Batman.  Each character is written in a dynamic manner, showing both strength of character and hidden flaws. Dent slowly transitions to his role as Two-face, the most unpredictable (including the Joker) Batman foe of all, sometimes committing crime and sometimes delivering justice.  He is willing, however, to cross the line that separates crime and law to pursue justice.  One of the main themes of the novel is the transition from Harvey Dent to Two-face.  It is extremely well done.   <br /> <br />     Jim Gordon is also shown as a family man whose sense of honor is unwaivering.  I really like the way that Gordon spearheads this operation/alliance, and also believe that \\"The Long Halloween\\" develops the character of Gordon the best of any graphic novel so far.   <br /> <br />     Batman is relegated to duty as Detective.  This is a detective novel, in which the protagonist is attempting to capture a murderer.  He will follow leads to this strange Holiday killer and bring him in.  That there is a good mystery in a Batman novel is a necessity that I think some of us Detective fans take forgranted.   <br /> <br />    The book is just simply wonderful.  It is a murder mystery, a coming of age, and personal war all in one chronicle.  At the risk of sounding cliche, it has something for everyone who is a Batman fan.  It may be the best work of Batman fiction ever to grace the bookstore.	2005-06-27

In this case, however, it is a villain who is portrayed.       The Joker has changed radically from age to age, much like the Batman.  In the thirties and early 40's, the Joker is a diabolical thief and killer; often outsmarting everyone in Gotham.       In the 50's and 60's, however, the Joker refrains from killing people, and makes his primary task in crime to humiliate Batman and Robin.  In some ways this compromises the almost satanic degree of evil that the Joker is capable of in his more contemporary incarnations.  In other ways, it makes for a more engaging storyline as the primary focus is on a battle of wits and not of wills.       And of course the story of the \\"Laughing Fish\\" is just a classic criminal plot.  The Joker in the seventies became a compilation of attributes (mastermind, killer, eloquent rival) of his character from the different preceding eras, and is probably my favorite Joker of all.       The book exceeded my expectations, which were good ones!	2005-06-25

His actions which seem so unpredictable are given a strangely satisfying explanation.   <br />   I still cringe when I look at the picture of the Joker when he performs the \\"Killing Joke.\\"  He is a demon of unparalleled evil as he flippantly destroys human life.  This book has an ending that I still marvel over, which I obviously cannot, and will not, give away; it is one of the best literary uses of irony that I have yet seen.	2005-06-25

Understanding some of the current Batman storylines requires knowledge of this event.   <br />    The death in the family that the title describes molds the Batman character into what he is today; extremely reluctant to work with partners and overprotective of the two family members he still has.   <br />    Strangely, this event reminds me of why Batman is truly a hero.  Only he must pay the price for his one-man war on crime; casualties are unacceptable.  He is willing to sacrifice himself completely to the task of cleaning up and protecting Gotham, he is not arrogant or cruel enough to manipulate others to do his bidding, however.  This is his burden, and no one elses'.  I think it is more of necessity than choice that he does work with anyone else.   <br />    This book also reminds me of one of the things that most angered me about DC in this era; I wish they had just retired the second Robin because of his recklessness.  In fact, that is what Bruce considers before Todd's life is cut short.  So perhaps that complaint is overblown, but this will always remain Bruce Wayne's and Batman's, darkest day.  Keep that in mind when you decide whether or not to get this.	2005-06-25
US	14453482	R2FH2MCHF5TBTH	0877848106	299672701	The Unaborted Socrates: A Dramatic Debate on the Issues Surrounding Abortion	Books	4	17	20	N	Y	Another pros and cons list	Overall, I think this book is a fair representation of the issue.  The book is a debate among four characters, written like a Socratic dialogue.  At the end everybody still basically believes in what they already brought to the table with little or any, change.  The question at hand is:  Is abortion right or wrong, do circumstances change that answer, and if so, why? All that aside, the four characters:  Socrates- your typical gadfly  Rex Herod- an abortion doctor  Atila Tarian-a utilitarian philosopher who is pro-choice  Pop Syke- a psychologist that tries to discredit Socrates via psychoanalysis    Cons:  1)  I am by no means a feminist like some other critics, but I agree that having a woman in this dialogue would be appropriate.  In fact, as Kreeft mentions in the book, that men tend to be more pro-choice than women.  Most, if not all of the active pro-lifers I know are women!  So having a woman here could really only strengthen the argument.  Also, just for fairness, adding a pro-choice woman might help.  2)  This is just one issue, where try as we might, logic often breaks down.  Emotions and subjectivity always enter the discussion, despite our loftiest philosophical intentions.    Pros:  1)  I think it defines the real heart of the issue well:  Either you believe that a fetus constitutes human life or you do not.  Women's rights are important, and women do have the right to go through with this procedure in most countries; what critics must understand is that the morality, and not legality, of this action is the premise of the book.    2)  A spinoff of 1, the book demonstrates that morality and legality are not the exact same thing in our country, yet suggests that in a more idealistic sense they probably should be.  This argument is right out of Republic, where wisdom and virtue are not very optional.  3)  There are 3 people arguing the position that Kreeft dislikes, and only one arguing the alternative.  I think most of the best arguments for the \\"pro-choice\\" position are articulated within the book (women's rights, democracy cannot legislate morality, fetus is not truly human).  If this book was written by a pro-choice apologist, I would expect these arguments to prevail.  However, this is not the case and thus people should expect to see counterarguments that are well prepared and delivered.  Depending on your stance, this could be a pro or a con.  4)  The book is true to life as opponents attack Socrates by calling him a man without compassion; since Roe v. Wade, both sides have often viewed the other as merciless.    5)  I don't know why critics say that women's rights is a non-issue in this unfolding argument.  Women and their stake in this issue is the main argument of the third and forth characters introduced, Tarian and Syke.  I could see how people would dislike the idea that the personhood of the fetus, and not the mother's rights, is the central factor in deciding abortion.  However, Kreeft makes a case, a rather strong one, for that being the central issue on the morality of abortion.    6)  Again I would like to reiterate that the book brings up a fascinating philosophical question:  Just because it is legal, does that make it moral?  Should the laws of a country represent moral truths?  If so, what would that mean for abortion laws if abortion is immoral?          I've just come to expect 1-star ratings from some of the critics of Kreeft.  I might add that as I read their criticisms they don't sound like those of someone who actually read the book.  The book covers the major rhetoric that has occurred since Roe v. Wade.  I like Kreeft, and thus have a bias that I admit.   Nonetheless, I hope my opinion has been helpful to you.	2005-06-24
US	14453482	R8F1U2TML748U	0840744196	72098334	A Ready Defense The Best Of Josh Mcdowell	Books	5	109	125	N	Y	Very thorough and intriguing work of apologetics	Before I begin my assessment, just let me quote a previous critic:    \\"Being a student of religion, I can honestly say that I have never read a more sophomoric attempt at apologetics than McDowell's \\"A Ready Defense\\" and his \\"Evidence...\\" It is indisputable that the Mr. McDowell has targeted the ignorant and superstitious masses as his prime victims for an audience.\\"      I get the impression he/she? doesn't like it, so let me offer a different perspective.  This critic reminds me of another unbeliever of whom I have recently read:  Sigmund Freud.  The attempt of some to categorize every explanation of faith as \\"delusion\\" or \\"ignorance\\" is an ad hominem sidestep to the real question:  Does God exist?  If so, what is God like?        More particularly, is Christianity a religion revealed by God?  This is the main issue that McDowell addresses.             McDowell attempts to argue that the Old and New Testaments do have a foundation in divine inspiration.  He himself admits that part of the conclusion of the matter must ultimately be one of faith.          Furthermore, McDowell addresses some of the most pertinent questions as to the historical Jesus.  He does a better job (in my estimation) than Crossan, Schweitzer, and Bultmann; he admits up front the bias of Christian apologist where the latter cannot straightforwardly admit a presupposition of skepticism (hence a \\"hermeneutic of suspicion\\").         And perhaps McDowell again shows us that humility is a necessary ingredient for this faith, Christianity.  We do not elevate ourselves above the \\"ignorant masses\\" but sympathize with them in their pain and console them with what we believe to be truth.  We confess our own ignorance and attempt to gain wisdom from the beginning point of humility.  For we are all one in the common struggle of humanity, if nothing else.          Another critic confesses being turned off, but is at least honest enough to admit that he skipped to random pages and did not read the workas a whole. Reading only parts of the book one critiques seems illogical.       Logical thinking requires some sort of proposition that affirms or denies some truth and then proceeds to prove that course of thought.  McDowell discusses in this order:  Gospel authenticity, the historical Jesus, how Christianity is different from other religions in a comparative review, and questions about faith in general.  This is how the argument progresses.        Beginning with the authenticity of the Gospels is a shrewd move for McDowell because this is where many skeptics turned believers (CS Lewis, for example, and McDowell himself) became increasingly uncomfortable before their ultimate assent to faith.        Additionally, in reiterating the classic Lunatic, Liar, or Lord argument, McDowell insists that if the Gospels do not intercede with historical fact in some way, then the Christian faith is meaningless.  McDowell is willing to admit that he could be wrong; ironically his critics don't share the same proclivity.         Candidly, I am a former religion student, like the first critic, and a graduate of a divinity school, and also a student of philosophy, and Josh engages me quite seriously not despite my learning, but rather because of it.  Bacon once said (I'm paraphrasing) that belief was directly proportional to the amount of study one put forth (the very antithesis of the Freudian worldview).  So are ignorance and belief necessarily connected at the hip?         McDowell's thorough attempt to refute the popular forms of Bultmannian Christology would suggest that one does not have to divorce oneself from belief before he or she engages in academic study and serious thought.  In short, McDowell disengages from the \\"hermeneutic of suspiction\\" so prevalent in religious scholarship today.  For this reason alone, I applaud the very thorough and well documented effort that McDowell has put on the table.	2005-06-24

First of all, if I may get away with answering some critics.  I was a philosophy and religious studies student at a secular liberal arts university where Christianity was not thought of fondly.  I then went to a divinity school where I learned that not everything called \\"Christian\\" really is.  Though I may not be an expert, I know what kind of things go on in the setting that Kreeft has offered, a divinity school.<br /><br />  If nothing else, Socrates criticizes modernist \\"Christians\\" who try and have it both ways (All the success of the spread of Christianity without any doctrine or personal piety).  Now with regards to the critics, many of them use two words:  \\"straw man\\" and \\"fundamentalism.\\"  The irony is this:  anyone who does not want to critically consider the claims of Christianity calls even its basic, central beliefs (crucifixion, resurrection, Bible) \\"fundamentalism.\\"  Anyone who goes to Divinity School will (hopefully) learn that there have been Benedictines, Puritans, and Lutherans; however all these people had in common basic beliefs about who Jesus was and what he did.  After a belief is deemed \\"fundamentalist,\\" it is no longer studied.  Fundamentalism becomes such an all-encompassing, and thus poorly defined staw man, that Christianity is considered easily dispatched.<br /><br />  However, it would serve such critics well to read the sociologist of religion Martin Marty's \\"Fundamentalisms Observed.\\"  In it, he dispels the popular notion that fundamentalism is the predominant mode of Christianity, and second, contends that many \\"conservative\\" Christians really aren't fundamentalists.  In fact, this irony is aptly exposed in chap. 3 of Kreeft's book when Socrates concludes that the definition of fundamentalism employed currently is too broadly conceived.<br /><br />  Furthermore, this Socrates, for better or worse, is exactly the \\"gadfly\\" of the Apology/Phaedo, the eternal questioner.  The central method of Socrates was to start with a set of premisesand follow them to their logical conclusion.  Aristotle later criticized Socratic logic in his \\"Prior Analytics,\\" suggesting that premises themselves might have to be established from a more empirical basis, preventing an ad nauseam of logical progression.  However, this Socrates is the very rationalist who Aristotle criticized.  The exact reason for some of the philosophical overlaps between Socrates and Christians (theism, monotheism, ethical holiness of God) is still a subject of great debate; Kreeft just offered an answer to that overlap that displeases the philosophical secularist.<br /><br />  Perhaps the bottom line is that several critics don't want to acknowledge/consider even the most basic premises of faith.  In this sense, they are ironically dogmatic.  Either Jesus was who he said he was or he wasn't.  This much is a tautology. We'll call it J v ~J.  If he wasn't, it is because the Scriptures were untrue or the ones who wrote Scripture were deceived (argument in pp. 169-170, one critic stopped reading at 150).  The argument is logical.  What it really means is that Christianity is an all or nothing.  You either accept it or mightily refute it as a lie.  There is no middle ground of \\"Jesus was just kinda nice.\\"  The historical character and teachings of Jesus simply burned that philosophical bridge.<br /><br />  I guess my bottom line to critics is, just read the book.  Don't read the book reading your stereotypical view of a Christian apologist such as Kreeft into the book (an inherently ad hominem read).  Just take the premises as they come; avoid gratuitous emotion or subjectivity, try to look at the ideas themselves.  That is the true task of the philosopher, and Socrates makes that evident, unlike an \\"intoxicated hippie\\" (to use words of a profound critic of this book).  Socrates may yield to some foundational propositions that are occasionally questionable, but each argument he makes necessarily follows from the starting premises.<br /><br />  Whether you believe or do not believe, I implore you to look at the ideas and logic itself, and judge the book on this basis, not on the basis that this book is written by a Christian apologist.  I think then you will realize one thing that both a secularist and I can agree on:  Jesus was, and will continue to be, one of the most influential figures of all time.	2005-06-08

Thus an irony is exposed, namely the inclination toward the self-delusional of the \\"me\\" generations.<br /><br />  Socrates' famous dictum: \\"the unexamined life isn't worth living,\\" is the central tenet of the book.  Two people closely evaluate their lives and realize that everything may not be as it seems.<br /><br />  The hopeful effect this will have on a reader is for he or she to turn and examine his or her own life.

Kreeft's book is an insightful exegesis of some of the most difficult biblical text to understand.  In a rough outline form, let me share what I found to be some of the best aspects of the book: <br />1)  He makes a corollary from Ecclesiastes, Job, and Song of Solomon to passing from hell, purgatory, and heaven.  He keeps the terms of this analogy well.  For instance, he compares the meaningless vanity of Ecclesiastes to the tormenting void of desperation that is hell. <br />2)  I disagree with a previous critic who said Kreeft was fallacious in reasoning.  In fact, many of his arguments hinge on the necessity of logic:  the fallacies of ambiguous definition (what IS \\"happiness\\" and \\"meaning\\"?), the logical necessity of syllogism (the famous Augustinian syllogism concerning God's goodness and omnipotence), and the principle of causality:  what are the consequences of life choices?   No; logic is central to each work of Kreeft's.   <br />3)  It is a great book to read as a supplement to biblical text for a time of devotion and reflection each day.   <br />4)  It is a great introduction to the questions concerning both philosophy of religion and theology; for instance- what is the role of experience in faith?  Is fideism the appropriate stance of Christian faith?   <br /> <br />All in all, I think the book is fantastic.	2005-05-25

I vehemently agree with Kreeft on every point as a brother in Christ; having far more in common with him than with modernist \\"Baptists\\" who have simply folded up camp and retreated fearfully from ideological opponents.  Kreeft himself says in the book that he has more in common with me than with a Kennedy in his own state.  He is right.   <br />     Non-Christians will probably find this book horrible.  I don't think Kreeft was writing for a broad audience here- he realized that sometimes it is important, even necessary to preach to the allegedly obedient \\"choir.\\" <br />     The chapter with Satan discussing the battle plan is a page right out of the \\"Screwtape Letters.\\"  I think I have truly found a kindred spirit in Peter Kreeft, I would love to just talk to him someday.   <br />     Back on topic:  The essence of this book is a call ideally to all Americans to a state of higher moral and spiritual purity.  In this sense he will have vehement detractors; I laughed when he said the book would be banned in Canada as \\"hate speech\\" not because I thought he was paranoid, but because it seemed very plausible.   <br />      Finally his book uncovers an interesting dichotomy.  Those in power reserve the right to define \\"progress.\\"  Christians who believe otherwise are subtly or not so subtly labeled as extremists and perhaps considered \\"regressive.\\"  It shows an inherent flaw with people who push \\"tolerance\\" as the cardinal virtue, because there are a large group of people who they themselves cannot tolerate, or even hate.  This is because they view themselves as profoundly correct and opponents as incorrect.  Once truth and morality are relativized, however, it is illogical to impose any standard whatsoever.  Kreeftlays out a number of conundrums and deftly deciphers them.   <br />    Christians who look at the world with dissatisfaction should read this book.	2005-04-30

Lewis is probably the best Christian writer for both believers and unbelievers to read.  He dispels rumors that the orthodox Christian camp is one dominated by anti-intellectualism, thus being assertive with his Christianity; yet acknowledges the doubts of his past and the cleverness of his ideological opponents.<br /><br />  I strongly believe that Christianity is under attack from two places.  One place is from without; there will always be those who despise Christianity.  The other, however, is not so obvious: an attack from within where Christians have become compromising and complacent with what is supposed to be the crucial areas of life and faith.<br /><br />  I think Lewis is the ultimate and perfect blend of conviction and civility; and that is why his writing is so comforting as a supplement to Biblical texts.  What he does is show that Christianity is a particular, identifiable thing.  While this may fly in the face of postmodern anti-foundationalism and critique of \\"metanarratives,\\" mere Christianity sustains itself as not only a tenable, but the true, philosophy/religion.<br /><br />  Lewis is also an artistic man who is highly creative, and \\"The Great Divorce\\" and \\"Screwtape Letters\\" are proof enough of that.  He engages the Christian rationality, imagination, and spirit all at once, fulfilling the greatest commandment to love God with all that we are.  I highly recommend him to anyone.	2005-04-30

Lewis & Aldous Huxley	Books	5	48	50	N	Y	Pros and cons list for book:	Three men died on the same day in November, 1963:  JFK, Aldous Huxley, and CS Lewis.  The book is a fictional recreation of how their meeting might take place.<br />  I would like to write my review in the form of a pros/cons list with the following premise:  I really liked this book.<br /><br />Cons:  I think there are fewer than the pros by far, but my own view includes-<br />1.)  Though I actually agree with Kreeft's portrayal of Kennedy overall as a philosophical dilletante compared to Lewis and Huxley, Kreeft could have been a little more generous to JFK.<br />2.)  Kreeft is a little more philosophically specific than Lewis who wrote to more of a \\"lay\\" crowd.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1.)  I disagree with previous reviews that say that the book misrepresented Lewis.  Few people know the ins and outs of Lewis better than Kreeft.  Consider these parallels as proof:  A.)  the aut deus aut homo malus argument is a direct recapitulation of the lunatic, liar, or Lord argument present in Mere Christianity and some of Lewis' other works.<br />B.)  Those who say that Lewis believed that all cultures and religions were equal is not exactly correct.  Lewis believed that pieces of truth were lodged in other religions, but did not believe that all religions were created equal.  Again a close reading of the opening in Mere Christianity makes it clear that Lewis is an adamant Christian.<br />C.)  The way in which Lewis believed that all people were equal was in their imperfection when confronting the holy reality of God.  Huxley, on the other hand, adhered to a more pantheistic view of human nature that lumped the good and the bad in one ubiquitous whole.  The glaring metaphysical differences between pantheism and theism disclose the deduction that Huxley and Lewis were proponents of two profoundly different worldviews and thus had fewer mental/philosophical \\"overlaps\\" than might appear prima facie.  Reading the Lewis book, \\"Miracles,\\" makes that demarcation even clearer.<br />Pro #2:  There are times when Huxley really comes on strong.  If you read some of Kreeft's other works, you'll see he has a healthy respect of Aldous;in BHAH Lewis has read \\"Brave New World,\\" and in other nonfictional works Kreeft actually praises the insights in the aforementioned book.  I think the critique that Huxley is misrepresented is a bit unwarranted.<br />Pro #3:  It is a cool re-enactment of what is much like a Socratic dialogue.<br />Pro #4:  Kreeft isn't psychic, but seems to articulate the biggest differences between the three ideological camps of Christianity, modernism, and perennial philosophy/pantheism pretty well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.	2005-04-30
US	14453482	R2REF8AFG6CMNK	0802811213	279635094	Christianity and Liberalism	Books	5	20	21	N	Y	This book will help you understand what "Christian" means	This is one of the first books I have read out of college and graduate school.  What Machen does is establish a definitive difference between the liberal and Christian movements.  That demarcation is well articulated. He talks about some of the centerpieces of Christian faith and how these cornerstones are actually undermined (\\"deconstructed\\")by liberalism and then reconstructed to cater to a new set of philosophical and theological presuppositions.         I would like to reiterate an earlier reviewer who noted that Machen is not trying to critique liberalism, but rather to show that it is a movement quite significantly different in almost every way from Christianity.  Now if liberalism cannot survive except in fringes outside of its usage, or even usurpation, of Christian imagery; then that in itself is telling.  However, Machen's primary task is one of definition:  What is a liberal?  What is a Christian?  Given the connotations, denotations, and intensions of each definition, Machen concludes that \\"liberal\\" and \\"Christian\\" are two different entities.              I admit my analogies stink, but let me put it another way.  If you define a duck as something that goes \\"moo,\\" you must fundamentally change the nature of the object perceived.  This is basically the philosophical idea of correspondence; namely that our definition is only as good as it actually represents the thing defined.  Perhaps if enough people began thinking this way (that a duck makes the moo sound), it could become so.  That's really more of a Wittgenstein thing, anyway.  The hope of many liberals is to make Christianity something it has not been and maintain that change long enough so that the very definition of the faith changes.  In my heart of hearts, I and perhaps Machen, want to believe they are doing this for the good of the faith.  Even with the best of intentions, however, liberalism is still an attempt of some to reconstruct or revise Christianity, to customize it to their own ideological palates.          Some of the book actually makes predictions that are becoming truer of the cultural climate in the U.S. today, including that the Christian character of seminary/divinity education is fading to make way for a more Unitarian way of thinking.  Doctrines on salvation, the church, Jesus, and God that were indispensable to historical Christianity are being replaced by more \\"digestable\\" theologies.                   If you are a Christian, this book is for you.	2005-03-31
