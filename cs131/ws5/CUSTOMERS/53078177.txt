For Zelazny fans, it is something more - even a mediocre Zelazny is better than most writers' best. Fred Saberhagen's contribution was not so obvious to me, although no doubt it had to do with the \\"conscious computer\\" aspect of the plot.<br /><br />The action moves right along from the start, in a version of the \\"Wait a minute - I don't know who I am!\\" scenario that appears in Edward Dmytryk's movie \\"Mirage\\", Heinlein's short story \\"The Strange Profession of Jonathan Hoag\\", A.E. van Vogt's \\"The World of Null-A\\" and Desmond Bagley's fine thriller \\"The Tightrope Men\\".<br /><br />Challenged by his new girlfriend Cora, Don BelPatri begins to wonder about his idyllic existence. Living in Florida, comfortably well off, enjoying life day to day, he has only vague recollections of his earlier life. But when he takes Cora to see his parents, he finds that he has never before seen the town he thought of as home. When he has himself examined by a psychologist, the man is found dead the very next morning. Then Don discovers that his mind can reach out and \\"see\\" the internal states of computers - and even change them.<br /><br />The tension is built up skilfully as more and more of the truth is revealed, and Don finds himself up against formidable and ruthless enemies. Although his growing ability to control all kinds of electronic equipment gives him a huge advantage, in the end he needs all the help he can get from his friends - and even some of his enemies.<br /><br />Don's ability to exercise direct mental control over computer circuitry remotely is a mixture of inspiration and naivete that only a handful of authors could pull off. \\"Coils\\" was published four years before William Gibson's first novel, \\"Neuromancer\\" appeared in 1986, but Alfred Bester had explored similar ideas in \\"The Computer Connection\\" (1973) and subsequent work. Bester's thinking seems to have paralleled Zelazny's, as can be seen from their later collaboration on \\"Psychoshop\\".<br /><br />Zelazny was to take the theme much further, for instance in \\"24 Views of Mt Fuji, by Hokusai\\" (in \\"The Last Defender of Camelot\\") and his last, unfinished, novel, the magisterial \\"Donnerjack\\"...ter collaboration on \\"Psychoshop\\".

Cyborgs are way beyond today's science, and time travel may be downright impossible. But how close could a writer get to \\"Terminator\\" using only technology that is available today, or will be within a few years? The result might well look a lot like \\"Prey\\". Crichton draws on his wide knowledge of current scientific developments to paint a terrifying scenario of what could happen, very soon, when greed and commercial ambition dictate cutting a few corners to get to market first.<br /><br />Take some leading-edge nanotechnology, blend with software agent algorithms, sprinkle on some fairly standard biotech, and optimise for the requirements of the military. To anyone who knows a bit about software, that is a prescription for something you don't want anywhere on the same planet with you - but the protagonist of \\"Prey\\" finds himself up close and personal with. Crichton skilfully feeds the reader just enough information to keep the tension building steadily, but holds back a few devastating surprises.<br /><br />On the downside, as with so many techno-thrillers, the end seems to come rather suddenly, and one or two really intriguing aspects of the plot are never fully explained. That may be the price of writing a novel that depends so heavily on technical riddles: when the action is done, it would be out of place to go on and wind up the lecture. Still, I for one far prefer novels that teach me things I didn't know before.	2005-02-13

Gunnery duels with a German heavy cruiser and an Italian battleship are both shown to be less one-sided than they might seem: a single 8-inch shell could pierce the battlecruiser's flimsy armour, while the battleship's greater strength may be outweighed by superior gunnery. As always in war, nothing is certain except that death or injury are only an eyelash away.<br /><br />The book is by no means one-sided. The action sequences take up only a fraction of the time, leaving plenty of room for character development and even one or two romantic subplots. There is nothing two-dimensional about even the least of Reeman's people.<br /><br />However there does seem to be a rather breathless quality about the book, as if it had been written in too much of a hurry. Although its technical accuracy is perhaps slightly greater than that of a more emotional novel like Alastair Maclean's famous \\"HMS Ulysses\\", it lacks the steadily mounting tension that made that book impossible to put down. Especially towards the end, some of the scenes seem to be almost perfunctory.<br /><br />The author's grasp of detail and atmosphere is flawless, which is not surprising as he joined the Royal Navy in 1941 and served in the North Sea, the Atlantic and the Arctic. This is Reeman's 32nd book, not counting another 23 written as Richard Kent.	2005-02-13

Every single one of us is going to die, and although we become very good at not thinking about it - developing a kind of mental blind spot that hides the awareness - it might be a good idea to give it some thought. Besides, we could pick up some tips that put off the evil hour. Such as not deciding to ski the rest of the way when our car breaks down in subzero conditions a few miles from the friend's house where we are going. Such as taking the right anti-malarial drugs before going to a part of the world where that disease is endemic. Or not free-soloing a rock face of difficulty 5.9 with no one else in sight or hearing distance.<br /><br />As Peter Stark explains, risking your life helps you to experience life more fully. But sometimes risks turn out badly, and then it may be too late to be sorry. \\"Last Breath\\" tells you exactly what it is like to drown in a \\"hole\\" while kayaking a turbulent river, to die of dehydration in the Sahara, or to be buried by an avalanche. So you don't need to try these experiences yourself - which is a good thing, if you want to go on living.<br /><br />This book is packed with fascinating information about our bodies, how they work, and their relationship with the surrounding environment. Without the support of technology - clothes, houses, heating, and so on - human beings can live only in a narrow band close to the Equator, below 3.5 miles above sea level, and where there is plenty of fresh water. Stark drives home to the reader just how easy it is to misjudge things when stepping outside the ideal environment. Sometimes just one wrong movement - or even one necessary thing left undone...<br /><br />At the end of \\"Last Breath\\", I found there was a wonderful unanticipated bonus. *I* was still alive!	2005-02-13

Tiger!\\") Alfie Bester needs no introduction. His brand of science fiction is, as far as I know, unique in its sheer energy. In his blending of scientific ideas with eclectic cultural, psychological and philosophical background, Bester anticipated (by over 20 years) acclaimed writers like William Gibson and the cyberpunk school.<br /><br />This book presents a lot of Bester's work that would otherwise be inaccessible. It packs ten stories, half a dozen articles, and interviews with John Huston, Rex Stout, Woody Allen, Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein into its 500-plus pages. Some of the writing is raw, but it is never dull or predictable, and for a fan it is fascinating to trace the evolution of Bester's style and read his own explanation of how and why he wrote that way.<br /><br />Having seen this book in a public library, I borrowed it and devoured it over Christmas. Although I have read every page, I am now buying a copy. I am not willing to risk being unable to get hold of it again. Bester died in 1988, unfairly neglected, and this book is the closest anyone can get to meeting him.	2005-02-13
US	53078177	R1KA8LF5XWXECA	0812575393	139616359	Dead Hand	Books	2	0	1	N	N	Great concept - shame about the writing	What happens to an automatic nuclear response system when an asteroid hits Siberia, causing destruction similar to multiple hydrogen bombs? And can a multi-national special forces team survive the inferno, let alone disarm the threat? It sounds a really promising subject for a military thriller, but this book just doesn't deliver on its promise. When I first read Harold Coyle's \\"Team Yankee\\", I was enthralled. Set in a similar situation to Tom Clancy's \\"Red Storm Rising\\", Coyle's book zoomed in on a single US armoured unit and followed its fortunes throughout the whole of a Soviet attack on Western Europe. Although obviously of interest only to war story fans, \\"Team Yankee\\" was as close to perfect of its kind as I ever hope to read. OK, so how does \\"Dead Hand\\" compare? The concept is just as good, and rather more imaginative. Even the plotting makes sense, but my enjoyment of the book was completely spoiled by what I can only describe as very poor writing. How could this book have been written by the author of \\"Team Yankee\\"? I can only imagine it was written in a tearing hurry, or under some similar difficulty. Infelicities abound; much of the dialogue (like Clancy's in his last one or two books) rings false; and foreign words are frequently misspelt. If you think I am exaggerating, by all means try your luck with this book. I actually threw my copy away after reading about half of it - something I hardly ever do.	2005-02-13
US	53078177	R2GNS01ILZOADO	0691004129	921852064	Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Not the last word, but provocative and well argued	This book's impact, for me, consists of the insight that people are part of the systems they build and operate. Because \\"to err is human\\", everyone from designers to operators makes mistakes from time to time. In complex systems, such mistakes can be expected to result in a steady stream of component failures, malfunctions, and accidents - hence the book's provocative and memorable title.<br /><br />After a very readable introduction, the author examines six important areas of technology (nuclear power, petrochemical plants, aircraft and airways, marine accidents, dams and mines, and \\"exotics\\" - space exploration, weapons of mass destruction, and recombinant DNA research). He plots these on two dimensions - complexity and coupling - and comes to the unsurprising conclusion that complex, tightly-coupled systems are bad news. Complexity means that unexpected accidents will happen, and tight coupling means that when they do happen, they will touch off further problems too quickly for human intervention.<br /><br />First published in 1984, the book shows its age in some ways, and the author has updated it somewhat with an Afterword and a Postscript on the Y2K problem.<br /><br />It would be hard to read even the first chapter without feeling dismay at the apparent gaping weakneses of the systems described. It looks as if the greatest source of trouble in nuclear power systems, for example, is the routine failure of valves controlling the flow of water through pipes! True, the water may be at hundreds of degrees Centigrade, loaded with chemical contaminants, and even radioactive - but surely this is 19th century (or, at worst, early 20th century) technology?<br /><br />Then there is the ubiquitous evidence of human inadequacy. Imagine trying to monitor the working of a nuclear power plant whose control panel has 1600 separate switches and lights! (Especially when some of these have failed, and those awaiting repair are marked out by ordinary labels that hang down in fron of other, essential warning lights, preventing them from being seen). According to Perrow, one type of highly critical valve used to prevent a reactor melt-down was rated by its own manufacturer as likely to fail at least once every ten times it was activated! And it is hard to get excited when a fault light comes on, if it is known to have a habit of \\"playing up\\".<br /><br />It is the people failures, though, that are most disturbing. One of the most vital parts of a nuclear power station is the concrete containment structure, which makes sure that whatever accidents may occur, the external environment is not affected. So it is scary to hear about construction crews who did not seem very good at pouring concrete, to the extent that holes up to 180 cubic feet in size were found inside the walls they had built!<br /><br />Perrow relates many other interesting stories, perhaps the best being the one about the oil company that was drilling through a lake bed in the vicinity of a huge salt mine... resulting in the disappearance of lake, salt mine, oil rig, several boats, and part of a hotel. All because it was no one's particular job to make quite sure that the drill missed the mine...<br /><br />It seems clear that, as Perrow suggests, people should be assessed and evaluated as a system component. Just as steel or concrete comes in various grades at corresponding prices, people tend to have a characteristic \\"defect level\\" which is not altogether uninfluenced by their cost. When companies, perhaps because of hard times, skimp or ignore maintenance, cut out training, and fire the most experienced (and highest paid) workers, accidents are likely to become more frequent.<br /><br />In fact, we would have far more catastrophes but for a fact that Perrow also emphasizes - it is quite hard to cause a disaster. Everything has to be just right. In some industries, such as marine transport, this means that owners can continue to get by with minimum levels of investment. Sometimes, they are entirely insulated from the consequences of accidents.<br /><br />I feel that the book has opened my eyes in a number of ways, but I still suspend judgement. For one thing, Charles Perrow is a professor of sociology, not an expert in engineering or systems theory. Nothing wrong with that - it gives him a usefully \\"skewed\\" point of view - but he is probably not entirely qualified to understand engineering systems. Moreover, I feel he is at his best when relating case studies and drawing specific conclusions with his sociologist's hat on. His attempts to start a new discipline called \\"Normal Accident Theory\\" (NAT) do not look very convincing to me.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a fascinating book filled with interesting (and sometimes frightening) facts and interpretations. I feel sure that its core message - that human beings are part of the system, and should not be challenged beyond their reasonable limits - will be learned and taken into account by enlightened system designers.estment.

US	53078177	R1LO3CUBAV3V10	0375725261	694000010	Dead and Gone: A Burke Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Uneven, but any Burke novel is a treat	This is the twelfth Burke novel by my reckoning - \\"Pain Management\\" is the thirteenth - and it's a little different. While some readers may find that hard to accept, it is implicit in Andrew Vachss' style of merciless realism. Without giving too much away, Burke's elaborate defences finally let him down as he accepts one job too many. It spells the end of his life in New York, and very nearly the end of his life period. Things drifted a little out of focus for me as Burke sets out to track down those responsible, winding up in Portland, Oregon with a new identity and a new girlfriend. But then the momentum builds again, relentlessly, to an elegantly understated climax. On the way, we get some more flashes of Burke's early life when he and Wesley befriended a saintly boy with a talent governments would kill to lay their hands on. And pay a flying visit to a place that is almost literally out of this world.<br /><br />Vachss' style can't be everyone's favourite, or he would be top of the best-seller lists. But I for one rate his books as one of the things that make life worth living.	2005-02-13

Coloured diagrams of most classes mentioned, together with plentiful photographs, supplement very readable text descriptions. Before the end of the contents, the reader has been thrilled by photographs of Royal Sovereign, Resolution and Revenge (seen from the next ship ahead in line), the pre-dreadnought Agamemnon, and Malaya in company with Alabama and South Dakota off the coast of Norway.<br /><br />The layout is a bit capricious, with some classes being relegated to brief mentions or telescoped into the sections on similar ships. Now and then, the author sees fit to pop in a \\"feature\\" - for instance the account of Heligoland Bight and the Falklands that appears opposite the text on the Invincible class battlecruisers. These are welcome, although they sometimes break up the logical progression of designs through the years.<br /><br />I am not qualified to judge the book's accuracy, so I cannot dispute or confirm any statements made on this score. At least there were no errors gross enough to leap off the page at me.	2005-02-13

Covering about five years (late 1996 to late 2001), it contains over 200 parliamentary sketches originally published in The Times. This period includes the successful election campaign run by Tony Blair and his \\"New Labour\\" party, after nearly two decades in opposition to the Conservatives, and the first four years of the new dispensation in which \\"Things can only get better\\".<br /><br />Just one word of advice - this book is like a very, very large box of assorted chocolates. Dip into it in moderation, as too much at a time can be cloying. Wisely used, however, it is not just very funny indeed, but also educational and full of interesting ideas.<br /><br />Parris has been there, done it, and got the t-shirt. He was a Conservative Member of Parliament, and in that capacity interacted with political giants like Margaret Thatcher. His experience of practical politics gives his writing far greater depth and insight than that of most journalists. But his writing style, far from resembling the plodding prose of so many politicians, is sparklingly witty. He is not always right, of course, but he has the moral courage to admit that freely and carry on.	2005-02-13

After a few hundred pages, I found myself plodding through it dutifully, reluctant to consign it to the bin where I felt it belonged. About page 700 the military plot began to roll, and for a few hours I was enthralled by the kind of writing for which Tom Clancy became famous.<br /><br />What is wrong with this book? For my taste, the author has overreached by tackling characterisation, extensive dialogue and political philosophy. While his personal opinions are as valid as anyone else's, the resulting book bored, annoyed and upset me. I was bored because of the lack of a tight, suspensful plot. I was annoyed by the dialogue that seemed modelled on Nixon's White House tapes and the clumsy depiction of a US President who seems completely unqualified for the post. Although I am by no means a prude or a bigot, I was upset by the bad language and what I perceived as racial stereotyping.<br /><br />In conclusion, I have always enjoyed Tom Clancy's books because I felt that he was a superb storyteller, with an unequalled grasp of military detail and the ability to tell a story from many concurrent viewpoints. An important part of his art seemed to be that even the \\"black hats\\" always had believable ideals and convictions. In \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\", I feel that Jack Ryan has succumbed to the Peter Principle - he has been promoted far beyond his level of competence. This book could have been about half the length, and if the right parts were cut, I think I would have enjoyed it much more.<br /><br />I don't know if I will be buying any more books by Tom Clancy. I certainly won't buy any more in hard cover - my criterion of a favourite author.	2005-02-13
US	53078177	R3VD8H47PY0KK8	0718173104	936127073	The Unforgiving Minute	Books	5	9	9	N	N	One of the best books about long distance running	Ron Clarke first became famous as the 17-year-old lad who carried the Olympic torch into the stadium at Melbourne at the start of the 1956 Games. None of the watching millions knew that burning material from the chemical torch was spilling down his arm - Ron climbed the steps and lit the flame, then quietly went off to seek medical treatment. After showing great early promise he was overshadowed by the amazing talent of Herb Elliott. He faded from the scene while he got a job and married, then went back into training and shocked athletics fans everywhere by unexpectedly breaking the world records for 6 miles and 10,000 metres.<br /><br />At Tokyo in 1964, Clarke contested the 5,000 and 10,000 metres and came away with just a bronze from the 10,000 - sensationally won by US Marine Billy Mills. And so it went. In the next three years Clarke shattered world records left, right and centre, becoming the first man to break 13 minutes for 3 miles and 28 minutes for 10,000 metres (the latter with an amazing 27:39). But could he win a major championship gold medal? He could not. Finally, at the peak of his powers, Clarke went to the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City and ran his heart out - almost literally. He collapsed, at death's door, after being left far behind by runners whom he could have lapped at sea level, and never competed again.<br /><br />To know Ron Clarke is to respect and admire him. This book - more literate and insightful than most sports autobiographies - is full of delightful stories about some of the world's top athletes. Clarke's meeting with Emil Zatopek is at the top of my list. It would be impossible to find a better role model for a young man. Runners may have posted times minutes faster since then, but this book stands the test of time.	2005-02-13

In fact, there is evidence that it can take society from 10 to 25 years or even longer to accept a radically new idea. This often results in the original inventors being neglected while others reap the rewards long after.<br /><br />Occasionally, however, the exact opposite happens - as with personal computers and the Internet. In these (rather rare) cases, the new idea is so compelling that it sweeps aside all resistance and everyone simply must have it.<br /><br />Steven Schnaars has put together a fascinating and extremely valuable book by researching these syndromes. The title refers to the way that even leaders of industry repeatedly get their predictions wildly wrong. Strongly recommended for anyone involved with innovation, marketing, starting a new enterprise... or simply interested in the convoluted workings of the human mind.	2005-02-13
US	53078177	RFHOZSSLJNQ36	1558214518	564242006	The Other Kingdom	Books	4	10	11	N	N	Not the usual one-dimensional sports story	\\"The Other Kingdom\\" is a refreshing reminder of the days before world-class sport became a cold, professional exercise in earning money. It is unashamedly elitist, socially and intellectually as well as in terms of athletics, in a way that unmistakeably dates it. The protagonist's life, overshadowed by the reputation of a world-famous father, strikes an uneasy balance between his running, his girl friend, and his study of the German Sturm und Drang poets with their quest for heroism. At first glance, some of the athletics background looks to have been copied from real life - until you realize that this book was published in 1964, about the time of the Tokyo Olympics. So the runner who misses an Olympic medal by sprinting too soon, but later gets a European title, is not Michel Jazy: that didn't happen till 1966! Another amusing touch is the cover picture, which shows the young Herb Elliott. (If you're going to borrow from real life, why not borrow the best?)<br /><br />Courtesy of Amazon, you can read the first few pages here. Note how skilfully the author introduces all the main characters while describing a training run. This is easily the best account I have ever read of how it feels to run far faster than you ever thought possible. Something similar happened to Jim Ryun when he \\"unintentionally\\" broke the world record for the half-mile while competing in a collegiate event in 1966, leaving world-class rivals far behind without any particular effort. Ryun took nearly five seconds off his personal best that day, and soon after broke the world record for the mile.<br /><br />Bottom line: it's not a pure running story, by a long chalk. Instead, it shows convincingly how world-class sporting achievement must be rooted in a person's whole life.	2005-02-13

The Great War has not received as much attention as WWII, especially the war at sea, and Fullerton's \\"Nicholas Everard\\" series does much to redress the balance. For my money he is up there with Douglas Reeman and John Winton. His writing is as good as C.S. Forester's; the difference is that Forester, much as he would have liked to, never became a naval officer himself. Having finished this book, you might be disappointed that the experience is over. Good thing, then, that it is part of a series! I plan to read them all.	2005-02-13

What a shame that the editor should have put Harold Coyle's \\"Cyberknights\\" first of the four short stories in this collection. The other three are fine, but Coyle - although I hate to say it - has lost his bearings. \\"Cyberknights\\" has a promising theme: a special team of computer hackers is recruited by the US Army to defend against hostile hackers from other countries. Working closely with real soldiers and agencies like the NSA, these \\"Cyberknights\\" (yes, the pompous title is capitalised every time) also strike back against the countries they *think* are encouraging hostile activities. In the story, they respond to a hack that nearly splashes a flight of F16 fighter jets into the ocean by changing their flight orders \\"in the computer\\". (What computer this is, and why the USAF would be stupid enough to link it to the Internet, is not explained). The Cyberknights' response? They engineer the destruction of a chemical plant in the supposed aggressor country.<br /><br />Apart from being ethically dubious to say the least, the Cyberknights are ludicrous to anyone who knows the first thing about computer security. When counterattacking a hacker's PC, they see fit to upload a huge coloured picture of a charging knight - just to give warning of their intentions. It is clear that Coyle knows little about computers and the Internet, and he has made the mistake of assuming his readers know even less.<br /><br />\\"There is no war in Melnica\\" by Ralph Peters could not be more different. Instead of florid, pretentious fantasies supported by inadequate research, this is a simple, poignant vignette of the NATO intervention in the Balkans and its aftermath. Right from its opening words - \\"The workman tossed him a skull\\" - Peters grabs your attention and doesn't let go. With admirable economy of words, he shows you the senselessness of war, the impossibility of identifying the \\"good\\" (our allies) from the \\"bad\\" (our enemies), and the unbridgeable gulf between those who have been there and the distant politicians and brass who set events in motion without any idea of the consequences - even in retrospect.<br /><br />James Cobb's \\"Cav\\" is a tightly-written, exciting example of a genre in which Coyle (\\"Team Yankee\\", \\"Bright Star\\") and Peters (\\"Red Army\\" and \\"The War in 2020\\") have excelled. In 2021 the Islamic Republic of Algeria launches a Blitzkrieg invasion of its southern neighbour Mali, one of the poorest nations on earth. While heavy US and French forces are on the way, a small US Army detachment is sent to head off the Algerian armoured column, if possible, at the only pass through the strategic El Khnachich range of hills. It is a perfect scenario: the superior American equipment (with the advantage of surprise) is pitted against overwhelming force.<br /><br />R J Pineiro's \\"Flight of Endeavour\\" is the longest of the four stories, at 130 pages - but there is no danger of getting bored. What if the International Space Station housed, at the request of the UN, an array of 15 kiloton yield non-nuclear missiles for \\"anti-terrorist\\" purposes - and a terrorist happened to seize control of them? A female astronaut and a heavily armed team of Marines go up in a modified Space Shuttle to reclaim the weapons. Unfortunately, the space station is also equipped with a powerful chemical laser... It's a thrilling, thought-provoking situation, none the worse for having been anticipated by 50 years in Robert Heinlein's classic short story \\"The Long Watch\\" (1949).<br /><br />Apart from \\"CyberKnights\\", this book is well written, exciting, and ideal for the purpose I had in mind - distraction during a long flight. It also gave me some great ideas, and Peters' story explained more about the Balkans to me than ten years of news reports. Recommended - if you don't like the Coyle story, just skip it and read the rest.	2005-02-13

Mednis, an experienced grandmaster with some notable scalps (including Bobby Fischer's) shows in great detail how to play half a dozen openings with a view to winning the endgame. Apart from saving you a lot of stress and helping you develop a much more balanced game, it could turn out to be a marvellous secret weapon!	2005-02-12

Ships are listed for 18 countries, of which Great Britain had the greatest number of distinct classes - 20 in all, although the USA had more ships. The cruisers described in this book varied enormously in size, from the Japanese Yubaris (under 3000 tons) to the massive American Alaska class - battlecruisers in all but name at 30,000 tons, and hardly inferior to the undergunned German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. And then there were the Royal Navy's cruisers: typically medium sized, stoutly constructed to go anywhere and survive any seas, often old-fashioned in appearance but respected by friends and enemies.<br /><br />This is a fine thick book that gives masses of details, together with diagrams and photographs. Quite apart from its intrinsic merit, it is ideal for flattening out curled-up papers or cardboard! As well as a bibliography and index, it has a short (4 page) introduction that gives a quick history of the cruiser type in the First and Second World Wars, and even shows the numbers of WWII cruisers lost in various ways - 10 Japanese and 20 British ships, for example, were sunk by aircraft attack.<br /><br />One of the most interesting themes that emerges is the naval architects' frenzied quest for the ideal compromise between speed, striking power, protection and range. For a while, this was further complicated by the requirements of the Washington treaty with its (often infringed) 10,000 ton limit. The German Hipper class weighed in at 14,500 tons; the Italian Zaras at 11,700; and the Japanese Tone and Chikuma at 11,200. Sometimes there was a price to pay - the Hippers' machinery was prone to break down, and several of the larger Japanese cruisers were lacking in hull strength and stability. The Zaras, ironically enough, had nearly twice as much armour as the preceding Trento class; ironically because, when they were put to the test, it was by the 15-inch guns of Admiral Cunningham's battleships at Matapan, and they might just as well have been wrapped in tissue paper.<br /><br />Although the coverage of most classes described is thorough and detailed, one or two mysteries remain. For instance, what were the circumstances surrounding \\"the loss of Tomozuru on 12 March 1934\\"? Tomozuru itself is not listed in this book, no doubt because it was lost before the outbreak of the Second World War.<br /><br />British patriots and admirers of the Royal Navy will be delighted to read of the achievements of British cruisers, of which the Battles of the River Plate, First and Second Sirte, the Barents Sea and North Cape were only the tip of the iceberg. As Alastair Maclean noted in his best-selling debut novel \\"HMS Ulysses\\", the battleships might be bigger and stronger, but the cruisers did most of the actual patrolling and fighting - and dying.<br /><br />For naval enthusiasts - especially those interested in the Second World War - this book is not to be missed.nch guns of Admiral Cunningham's battleships at Matapan, and they might just as well have been wrapped in tissue paper. <br /> <br />Although the coverage of most classes described is thorough and detailed, one or two mysteries remain.

Douglas Reeman's words, from the prefatory blurb, put this novel accurately in context. Surprisingly and most effectively, its hero is not a Royal Navy skipper or even an American sailor, but the captain of a German cruiser. In 1944, when many Germans can already see the writing on the wall, Kapitaen zur See Dieter Hechler takes Prinz Luitpold, a Hipper class 8-inch cruiser, on a last daring commerce raid across the Atlantic.<br /><br />The Hippers, formidable on paper, did not live up to their promise - partly due to unreliable machinery, and even more to inconsistent, vacillating official policy. This book suggests how much better they could have done in the hands of resolute and independent commanders. Even Hechler finds himself under the thumb of an unpleasant Nazi admiral with a fraction of his talent (a recurrent theme in Reeman's books), possibly a fatal handicap when it comes to the inevitable confrontation with the individually weaker but more numerous British warships.<br /><br />As usual Douglas Reeman's expertise shows through every page. His description of life in Nazi Germany after four years of total war is no less deft and convincing. This is a splendid yarn of war at sea, but it also has a powerful human dimension. Sacrifice, cruelty, compassion, forgiveness... all the emotions of human beings pushed to, and beyond, their limits. Regardless of who they are, or which country's flag is fluttering from the mast.	2005-02-12

Now that is a challenge for a biographer - and Harry Thompson has risen superbly to the occasion. This 480-page blockbuster, crammed with detailed reminiscences, gives an unparalleled insight into the personality of this most English of comedians.<br /><br />What a long way it is from Peter Cook's grandfather, a railway official in Kuala Lumpur who shot himself under the stress of a big promotion, and his father - a \\"sea-green incorruptible\\" colonial administrator - to the party he threw at the Cobden Working Men's Club in 1993, where the Rolling Stones rubbed shoulders with the Monty Python crew, two England cricket captains, Julian Clary and a mass of other celebrities. So tight was the scrum that Alan Bennett and Jonathan Miller never managed to greet their host at all.<br /><br />Like a stock market boom/bust cycle, the ups and downs of Cook's career were hugely amplified by the dictates of fashion. He was lucky enough to catch the early 1960s satire wave, and quickly became so sought-after that President Kennedy and his wife actually had to go and meet him, after he declined an invitation to the White House. Other than becoming global dictator, there was hardly anywhere to go after that but down - and Cook's perfectionism and lack of ambition conspired to make the descent almost as fast as the rise.<br /><br />Cook's attitude to alcohol may have been at the root of his downfall. He simply wasn't prepared to give it up, and - like many people to whom money is no object - found himself drinking more and more. He even turned up for shows hardly able to stand, although he redeemed himself by recovering miraculously when the curtain went up. Like Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead, who had a similar problem with heroin, Cook showed a curious fatalism about the habit that he knew very well was killing him and driving away the people who meant most to him. Also like Garcia, he managed to kick it in his final years, when his health had already been ruined.<br /><br />Like all great biographies, this book involves us in the tragedy of success that contains the seeds of its own destruction. It is also the story of a tremendously talented and likeable man.ook showed a curious fatalism about the habit that he knew very well was killing him and driving away the people who meant most to him.

While not a grandmaster himself, Elie Agur has obviously made a deep study of Bobby Fischer's games. In this fascinating and highly instructive book, he analyzes the elements of Fischer's style with reference to specific games. As Agur says, \\"Besides being a study on Fischer, it is a treatise on the middlegame at large\\". Over 300 diagram positions are taken apart, with a page or more sometimes devoted to a single move, its implications and alternatives.<br /><br />Topics include pawn structure, piece placement, material, timing, strategy (e.g. plans, seizing the initiative, liquidation, and playing for space), clarity, straightforwardness, alertness, reducing the opponent's options, playing to win, practical chances, tactics, technical aspects and overall vision. Fischer's weaknesses are not allowed to pass unmentioned, either. Agur devotes whole chapters to superficiality, misplaying won positions, and typical blunders and oversights.<br /><br />You can learn all sorts of fascinating details about the great man and his opponents. For instance, Fischer's decision to play Alekhine's Defence against Ciocaltea in the 1965 Capablance Memorial tournament amazed fans. Agur explains what really happened. Fischer was participating by cable, as the State Department denied him a visa to go to Fidel Castro's Cuba in the aftermath of the 1962 missile crisis. Ciocaltea's first move was received as 1. d4 and so played on the board, and Fischer replied 1...Nf6 as usual. Only when the second move, 2. e5 came through was the mistake discovered. Characteristically, Fischer refused to change his first move and achieved a hard-fought draw after a long struggle against an opponent he would often have expected to beat.<br /><br />For my money, this is a superb book. If I had to choose between it and any other book on Fischer - even his own \\"60 Memorable Games\\" - I think I would have to pick this one. It strikes a perfect balance between quantity and quality. Reading it carefully should increase anyone's playing strength, and is sure to afford hours of pleasure. Just one warning - chess theory has made huge strides since Fischer was playing, so don't take any of the opening analysis on trust without checking in a modern reference book.strength, and is sure to afford hours of pleasure.

The United States has to live with the burden of being the only nation that has ever used them, and against civilians at that. The justification was that, according to the best military estimates, invading the Japanese mainland would result in as many as 750,000 US casualties - and three times as many Japanese. The butcher's bill at Okinawa, Iwo Jima and many other islands had been appalling, and if foreign soldiers set foot on the home islands resistance would surely be even fiercer.<br /><br />Alfred Coppel hangs this towering story on a single \\"what if\\": suppose the Trinity atomic bomb test had failed? Rather than waiting many months for another test, might not President Truman have ordered the invasion to go ahead? Coppel draws on the actual plans that were drawn up for Operation Coronet (the invasion) and Ketsu-go Number 3 (the Japanese defences). As well as the notorious kamikaze flyers, he puts us in the tiny, cramped cockpit of a kaiten suicide submarine, and shows us a column of troops unexpectedly attacked by schoolchildren with bombs hidden in their clothing. Poison gas, flamethrowers... all the horrors of total war. In case any self-righteous Westerner should think such self-sacrifice belongs only to the fanatical Orient, Coppel quotes from Macaulay's \\"Horatius\\": \\"And how can a man die better/Than facing fearful odds/For the ashes of his fathers,/And the temples of his gods?\\"<br /><br />As in all the best fiction, a thread of human warmth runs through the apocalyptic scenes. Lieutenant Harry Seaver spent many childhood years living with a Japanese family near Tokyo, as a result of which he is bilingual and deeply familiar with the Japanese way of life. Far more so, in fact, than Lieutenant Jim Tanaka, who (apart from his name) is all-American. With tragic inevitability, Seaver's outfit captures the Maeda village - home of the family with which he grew up. While Colonel Kantaro Maeda is away conducting the defence, his sister Katsuko is still at home, and her reunion with Seaver - her childhood friend - encapsulates the gulf between East and West.<br /><br />The best book by Alfred Coppel that I have read - which is saying a lot - this is a real tragedy on many different levels. It's not an easy read, nor a happy one, but it is fascinating, thrilling and deeply rewarding.taro Maeda is away conducting the defence, his sister Katsuko is still at home, and her reunion with Seaver - her childhood friend - encapsulates the gulf between East and West. <br /> <br />The best book by Alfred Coppel that I have read - which is saying a lot - this is a real tragedy on many different levels.

Was it funny at all? I couldn't make up my mind. Then, more or less as the great climb got well and truly under way, something in my mind meshed with the sublime, ethereal imbecility of the author's theme and suddenly I kept roaring with laughter.<br /><br />In a way, this is a quintessentially English book. Its humour is so gentle, so oblique, so dry. Even the running gags - of which there are many - take a while to bed down. The first reference to carrying cases of champagne up the mountain tends to have little or no impact on your brain. It's such a ridiculously impossible idea that your mind simply rejects it. But it keeps coming back, progressively associated with the expedition leader's stolid persistence in believing that it is all for \\"medicinal purposes\\", until suddenly you are swept away by helpless laughter.<br /><br />If you appreciate dry wit, and you happen to have a day to spare (two half-days will answer almost as well), you really owe it to yourself to join our intrepid heros and share their triumphs, disasters and general roaring incompetence. You won't regret it.	2005-02-12

The Royal Navy established a splendid record during both world wars, but occasionally nodded with disastrous results. The sad tale of aircraft carrier Glorious is one of the most extreme instances of this fallibility.<br /><br />As might be expected of John Winton, one of the very best authors of naval fact and fiction, this 220-page book tells everything worth knowing about Glorious herself, plus a lot of interesting background. Originally a \\"large light cruiser\\", the size of a battleship and armed with four 15-inch guns, but with virtually no armour, she was one of the stranger offspring of Lord Fisher's fertile imagination. Essentially, she and her sister ship Courageous were designed as fast monitors with the aim of racing across the Baltic and bombarding German land forces in support of a surprise invasion. When this scheme was permanently shelved in favour of the less hare-brained (!) Gallipoli campaign, the weird mutant ships (known to the Fleet as \\"Outrageous\\" and \\"Uproarious\\") were left without any realistic employment. After the first world war, they were converted to aircraft carriers - so far, so good.<br /><br />Never was a ship so wrongly named, for her end was about as inglorious as possible. Detached from the rest of the fleet on the way back from the abortive Norwegian campaign, and commanded by a captain who apparently had no use for flyers, Glorious not only had no combat air patrol up, but did not even have a lookout at the masthead! So when the German battle-cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau appeared over the horizon, they were able to shoot her to pieces at leisure. Then, after the escorting destroyers Acasta and Ardent had also been sunk in hopeless counterattacks, over 1000 sailors floated in the sea for days until most of them were dead. Why? The king of Norway was also at sea in a British cruiser, and radio silence was enforced.<br /><br />And yet things could have turned out so differently. Taranto lay only six months ahead, Pearl Harbor and the sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse a year and a half. The German ships could have been the ones in jeopardy had Glorious been forewarned by an air patrol. She could have stayed under the horizon and launched air attacks, while summoning help.<br /><br />Many factors affected the outcome, including the Royal Navy's slowness in coming to terms with the realities of air power. There is more to war at sea than moving model ships around on charts, and this book gives a penetrating insight into how such battles are won - or lost.ave turned out so differently.

Most people, even in Britain, probably remember little or nothing of him - but those who do form the most idolatrous of fan-clubs. The Stephen Fry quote on this book's cover, \\"The funniest man who ever drew breath\\" is a typical example. Cook's tragedy was that his humour was most effective by far in a roomful of people; slightly diluted on the stage, it lost something more on TV, and I could not help but notice that I ploughed my way through this 400-page book with frequent smiles but only an occasional laugh. His attempts to break into films were actually embarrassing, as a viewing of the original \\"Bedazzled\\" will confirm.<br /><br />As William Cook points out in his perceptive Introduction, \\"Cook was a miniaturist. His speciality was a conversation of only several minutes duration. His quick-fire creativity didn't lend itself to longer, more structured genres\\". Consequently, his best work was done in cooperation with others. For instance, although Cook wrote about two-thirds of the script for \\"Beyond the Fringe\\", the result would not have been nearly as entertaining without the contributions of Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller and Dudley Moore. Like a powerful spirit, Cook's wit was potent - but perhaps best when diluted even slightly.<br /><br />This book is a fine collection of Cook's work, together with a good deal of information about his life. It is, however, far from \\"complete\\", although approaching this goal more closely in the later years when Cook's output was much reduced. It makes a great companion to Harry Thompson's biography of the great man.	2005-02-12

That's about how long it takes for a big idea to soak into the awareness of managers everywhere - especially those who are more committed to looking good than to managing well.<br /><br />Tom DeMarco, co-author (with Tim Lister) of the magnificent \\"Peopleware\\", has done it again. Although \\"Slack\\" runs a little over 200 pages, you will probably read it in less than four hours because it is actually quite hard to put down. You will keep on thinking, \\"Yes, I've seen that!\\" and \\"Those words ring a bell\\".<br /><br />In the course of his consultancy practice, which has taken him into many organizations including Apple, HP, Lucent and IBM, DeMarco has noticed a lot of counterproductive management behaviour. Many acts and policies that look good in the short term lead to corporate death in the longer term. More specifically, it is always possible to squeeze out a few more percentage points of \\"efficiency\\" - but only at the cost of damaging morale, precipitating burnout and losing the flexibility without which sensible decisions cannot be made.<br /><br />Faster isn't always better. Effectiveness matters more than efficiency. People are not interchangeable \\"resources\\". Without challenge and growth, the best employees soon leave. Overheads are not necessarily bad. Consciously or subconsciously, we already know these things. DeMarco just hammers them home so we will never forget them again.<br /><br />I really have only one quibble with \\"Slack\\". DeMarco has no business criticising Dilbert and his fellow engineers for \\"giving up\\" on their pointy-haired bosses. Sure, employees have a responsibility to make allowances and go the extra mile - but the PHBs systematically abuse every extra bit of slack that anyone cuts them. That's part of the joke, of course.<br /><br />This is not just a book that will confirm your suspicions, and reassure you that you are not the one who is going mad.

As he points out, the style is slightly different from the earlier book in being rather more personal and giving more psychological insights and anecdotes. The effect is to make it a more enjoyable read, if slightly less intense.<br /><br />I have always thought of Nunn as a classical chess player, in that he studies the opening profoundly, seeks to gain advantage (or equalize) in orthodox - though vigorous - fashion, and also has great strength in the endgame. This combination of erudition and straightforwardness makes him a particularly good subject to emulate. These 40 games are annotated really deeply, although the opening analysis needs to be checked for new discoveries in the ten years since publication.<br /><br />Perhaps the high point of this collection is Nunn's 25-move victory over Sokolov of the USSR at the Dubai Olympiad, 1986. Wiping a top Soviet player off the board so unceremoniously was something that British players hardly ever did until Nunn and Tony Miles came along. (They were usually happy to draw).<br /><br />The openings reflect Nunn's fairly stable repertoire - assorted Black defences to his 1. e4, with quite a few Sicilians, and a high proportion of King's Indians as black. Unfortunately the book lacks an index, and the brief table of contents does not say what opening was played in each game. So there is nothing for it but to read methodically through from start to finish. Thanks to Nunn's exciting style and painstaking, literate notes - spiced up by the occasional amusing story - this is no sacrifice at all.	2005-02-12

Certainly his academic work grabbed the public imagination, and his factual book \\"The Dinosaur Heresies\\" stirred up controversy with his theory that dinosaurs were actually fast, warm-blooded animals quite like modern mammals and birds. But to write a full-length novel about the day-to-day life of a dinosaur? How interesting could that be?<br /><br />Well, maybe it's me - when I was a boy I used to devour the \\"animal books\\" of Jack London and Ernest Seton Thompson - but I just couldn't put \\"Raptor Red\\" down. You hear that said a lot, but this time it was literally true. Told in the present tense throughout, this story simply rips along, going from one thrilling episode to another and astonishing you with little-known but exciting facts and informed speculation.<br /><br />By the way, the heroine (you have to call her that) turns out to be almost identical to the \\"velociraptors\\" in the film \\"Jurassic Park\\". (Please see the first Comment below this review for a correction of the following statements). At the time, everyone thought Steven Spielberg had contradicted all the scientific evidence by making his raptors twice as big as human beings - then in 1982, the year before the film was released, someone dug up fossils from a raptor that was almost identical to Spielberg's. That animal - christened Utahraptor - is Raptor Red, and she tangles with some scary opposition along the way. You wouldn't think there would be much that could threaten a fast-moving 500-pound monster with razor-sharp claws and teeth... until page 16, anyway.<br /><br />Bakker is a born writer, and not only does he keep the action humming along, he even finds time for a lot more character development than you will find in many novels about people. Within a few pages you will find yourself identifying with Raptor Red, urging her on as she stalks prey, holding your breath when she is in danger, even sighing when she finds a mate. Then you pinch yourself and remember that she'd have YOU for dinner in about half of no time at all.<br /><br />The key lies in Bakker's belief that some dinosaurs - certainly utahraptors - were highly intelligent, perhaps as much so as wolves and bears, or even the great apes. That opens up a whole new dimension that most renderings of the prehistoric world have utterly lacked.<br /><br />Although it's a compact and inexpensive paperback, \\"Raptor Red\\" has been carefully produced, with considerable attention to detail. Starting with the holographic portrait of Raptor Red herself on the cover - it's corny, but I liked it. Every one of the 26 chapters begins with a little thumbnail drawing of a type of dinosaur mentioned in the story.

Every one of the 26 chapters begins with a little thumbnail drawing of a type of dinosaur mentioned in the story. And Bakker has written an interesting and instructive preface and epilogue, to explain some facts he couldn't reasonably fit into the book itself.    If you are in the least interested in dinosaurs, or animals of any kind - read it! You can't go wrong.	2005-02-12

Many of the combinations simply take your breath away, while others elicit a nod of satisfaction. What's more, players of virtually any strength can learn a huge amount by studying the analysis and extensive variations. After all, chess is at least three-quarters tactics! (You can be a grandmaster of strategy, but you will flounder even at club level if you are prone to miss combinations).<br /><br />A few decades have passed since the book was writen, but don't let that discourage you - chess truths are immutable, and there is nothing in here that is less valid in 2005 than in 1951. The writers indulge in a chatty style, witty in a learned sort of way, but refreshing compared to the half-baked quality of too many chess books. To be fair, I suspect that grandmaster Keres' contribution was much less than master Golz's (the Russian spelling of German \\"Holtz\\"?), but it doesn't really make any difference. The value of this book lies in the hundreds of combinations, sacrifices and tricks, and it will reward many subsequent re-readings. One of my perpetual favourites.	2005-02-12

His style is exceptionally interesting, combining pragmatism with fantasy, and he is an authority on the endgame. When Speelman gets unhappy with his position almost anything can happen, and his opponents are chronically aware of the \\"swindling hazard\\" they incur by gaining an advantage against him. In one of the games in this splendid collection, he sacrifices his queen for a couple of minor pieces - a transaction which, in a lesser player, would look like a downright blunder - then consolidates his position and clinches a win against a strong opponent by the most logical of moves. Such exploits invite comparison with the legendary David Bronstein, who arguably would have been world champion if he could have overcome his boredom with humdrum chess.<br /><br />Speelman is one of the game's great fighters, as witness his wins against players like John Nunn, Nigel Short, Tony Miles and Viktor Korchnoy. This book also includes his two draws against Kasparov - one of them from a position with tripled isolated pawns! - which must have left the Baku maestro fuming and frustrated.<br /><br />This book is hugely instructive from the practical player's point of view, because it gives insights into how chess games are really decided at the highest level. None of your crystal-clear strategic crushes here, consistent from first move to last. Speelman is breathtakingly candid about his thought processes and the sometimes apparently random factors that make the difference. A study of his games is bound to make anyone's play more resilient and resourceful - as well as being great fun and, occasionally, awe-inspiring.	2005-02-12

One of a class of five (her sister ships were Queen Elizabeth, Barham, Malaya and Valiant), she fought at Jutland in 1916, then at Narvik, off Calabria, Matapan, Crete and the Normandy invasion of 1944. Her shooting was generally agreed to be the best in the Fleet - as witness her single-handed ending of the battle off Calabria by hitting the Italian flagship Giulio Cesare amidships at the record range of 26,000 yards (13 nautical miles). And at the second battle of Narvik, she performed a unique feat by accompanying destroyers up the narrow Ofotfjord to sink eight German destroyers and a U-boat.<br /><br />Although the book focuses on the Royal Navy's seventh Warspite, 60 pages are devoted to the first six. There is also plenty of interesting material about life on board, the personalities of officers and men, and a wide cross-section of events in both world wars. After being severely damaged in the evacuation of Crete, Warspite was repaired in Seattle and returned home across the Pacific - just after the beginning of the Pacific War, while the Imperial Japanese Navy was running riot. Characteristically, she crossed the International Date Line at exactly the right time to miss Friday 13th February altogether!<br /><br />Old, tired and battered, Warspite was sent for scrapping in 1946 - a decision which many have condemned as disgracefully insensitive. How much better to have kept her as a museum ship, like HMS Belfast! As it happened, she never reached the breaker's yard, due to events eloquently described in the first of two poems included in the book. (How many battleships have had poems written about them?)<br /><br />The book was written quite soon after these events, and first published in 1957 - allowing the Foreword to be contributed by Admiral of the Fleet, Lord Cunningham of Hyndhope, the victor of Taranto and Matapan, who flew his flag in Warspite through the thick of the Mediterranean war.s flag in Warspite through the thick of the Mediterranean war.	2005-02-12

At 168 pages it is by no means lengthy, and can easily be read in a day; but there are still parts that you can skip without much loss - for instance, the chapter that tells you exactly who does what in a typical TV news studio. On the other hand, it is all quite interesting, and the authors back up their conclusions with solid facts.<br /><br />Postman and Powers are by no means against TV as a news medium, but they warn us to use it intelligently and with full awareness of its biases, strengths and weaknesses. For instance, they point out that TV is intrinsically serial: a programme unwinds at a constant pace, and all the viewers see all of it (unless they go off to make a cup of coffee). Newspapers, on the other hand, can offer far more (and more varied) information, because each reader can select what he or she finds interesting. The sheer cost of time makes a difference, too - as of 1992, when this book was published, one hour of news cost $500,000 to produce. With each second being worth well over $100, \\"dead time\\" is a no-no, and long explanations (i.e. over about 10 seconds) are undesirable. This leads to a superficial style, heavy on pictures and short on meaningful analysis.<br /><br />The authors make some trenchant points. \\"American television is an unsleeping money machine\\"; \\"...fires make a good subject for television news\\"; \\"Actually to see buildings topple is exciting...\\" They even argue that TV commercials offer a form of religious communication. Whereas gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins, commercials assure us that we can right on engaging in it: just don't forget to buy the right antacid pills.<br /><br />Anyway, do we really need to watch as much TV as we do? Postman and Powers note that, by the end of high school, the average American has spent more time watching TV than in school! TV news can be seen as addictive; we don't really need to know most of what it tells us, but once we start getting sucked in, it is hard to stop coming back for further fixes.

The King is a prisoner in the Tower of London; Churchill has been shot after a brief trial in Berlin; Germany and the USSR are still the best of friends; and the USA is reluctant to intervene. Austerity holds Britain in its icy grip, with luxuries more or less limited to the German occupying forces and those who succeed in ingratiating themselves.<br /><br />The successful invasion left swathes of ruin and destruction that have not yet been repaired. The blackened shell of a Panzer IV tank still sits halfway up Wimbledon high street. Anyone violating curfew, or breaking regulations, is likely to be shot or sent to a concentration camp. Yet there is no point in rebellion - that would just get more people killed. Apparently, the only way forward is to cooperate with the Germans. Kellermann hints to Archer that his young son might possibly attend the good German school in Highgate... On the other hand, perhaps he should be sent to a training school for young Nazis in Germany.<br /><br />While developing one of his usual opaque plots, Deighton cleverly shows the dilemma facing Archer and others in positions of responsibility. We see the British resistance as more like the present-day Iraqi insurgency (depicted as terrorists, criminals and diehards) than in the heroic light that has retrospectively fallen on those who persisted in fighting the Nazis after their governments had surrendered.<br /><br />As usual in a Deighton story, it is no use trying to work out which side anyone is on. Mostly, each of the leading players is on his (or her) own side. The question is: who can profit most by cooperating with whom? The answers turn out to be surprising indeed. Tension starts to build with the abrupt arrival of SS Standartenfuehrer Huth from Berlin - a man who stands for no nonsense, works for Himmler, and has dauntingly direct methods. Can the Resistance exploit tensions between the German Army and the SS to rescue the King? What is the secret of the scientist who is found shot dead, apparently suffering from an extreme case of sunburn? Add a beautiful American journalist, a sinister British secret service officer, a US military expedition, sundry criminals, black-marketeers and collaborators, stir vigorously... and get ready for some stunning entertainment.ngly direct methods.

This novel is set in a future that will be familiar to most SF readers: after a catastrophic plague that wiped out nine-tenths of humanity, the survivors are faced with a choice of rebuilding civilisation or fighting each other for the ever-diminishing supplies of food and other essentials. One man accepts the crushing responsibility of using all necessary force to reunite the Republic, with the inevitable violence and loss of life. Is he right? Or is he just a bloodstained butcher, driven by his own lust for power? Decades after, his very name can make or unmake governments - one of which eventually sends an armoured expedition to seek him out or confirm his death.<br /><br />Budrys has written only a few books, because he is very selective about the topics he chooses. Each book makes a statement that he felt to be important and worthwhile - and this one is no exception. Some Will Not Die is very well written, although poorly edited, and shows clear signs that the author was well acquainted with the grim realities of military life. Perhaps because it was assembled from independently-written sections, it adopts a flashback format that leaves a rather disjointed impression. Nevertheless, it is a book you will surely remember - both for its action and its ideas.	2004-12-07

In those days world-class chess was relentlessly dominated by the USSR, challenged mainly by other Eastern Europeans and the occasional American like Reshevsky, Evans and the Byrne brothers. Boris Spassky was soon to play \\"iron Tigran\\" Petrosian for the world title, and the only wild card seemed to be a crazy teenage genius from New York who could beat anyone at all on his day. Frank Brady's writing captured the sheer excitement of it all. For instance, in a great tournament with most of the best players in the world, Mikhail Tal expected Petrosian to crush the upstart Fischer, \\"but when Bobby beat the USSR champion the crowd roared\\".<br /><br />Brady's style is journalistic, but it fits his subject quite well. This much expanded edition takes Fischer's story all the way to winning the world championship, which is probably a logical place to stop. (Fischer stopped playing chess at that point, so the rest of his life has been lived in a very different world). The book is full of interesting facts that you could not read about anywhere else, and until a professional biographer turns his attention to Fischer - which may never happen, because he is about the least cooperative subject imaginable - it will remain the last word.<br /><br />The games section is a different story. Only a narrow cross section are given, with notes by Brady that reveal his lack of expertise. They are only there for completeness' sake, and should be read as an extension of the biography. If you want to understand Fischer's chess, read his Collected Games, his own \\"My 60 Memorable Games\\" (which is itself very limited in scope, though superb in depth), or Elie Agur's brilliant \\"Bobby Fischer: His Approach to Chess\\".	2004-12-07

In fact I found myself sitting up late to read the last third, because I just had to know the outcome. Connelly pulls together a large cast of characters: Bosch himself, one or two of his old police colleagues, the FBI - including Rachel Walling, the agent who shot the Poet - and the family of retired FBI agent Terry McCaleb. In a way, this is what causes the book's main problem: although good, it could have been even better. The first two thirds of \\"The Narrows\\" consists of a sustained build-up of tension, which arouses very high expectations. The relatively straightforward denouement feels like a letdown, but only relative to the terrific excitement that Connelly generates.<br /><br />There are a few interesting technical touches. Authors usually write in either the first person or the third person throughout. Here, Connelly makes Bosch the narrator, but cuts in and out with third-person views on the rest of the cast. To my surprise, he succeeds in making it work pretty well. He also gets away with mentioning the film of \\"Blood Work\\", and having a character read \\"The Poet\\". At one stage, Harry even feels \\"the wire in the blood\\".<br /><br />I suspect that Connelly is more interested in, and perhaps knows more about, police work than the psychology of serial killers. The Poet is scary, yes: but in a matter-of-fact way, whereas some of Thomas Harris', Mo Hayder's or Val McDermid's murderers inspire feelings of genuine terror. But this doesn't mean you can put \\"The Narrows\\" down easily, once you have got into it - it is just as absorbing as the previous Bosch books.<br /><br />Bottom line: I got this book as a Father's Day gift, but if I hadn't I would have been happy to buy it in hardback. That's not something I could say of many authors.	2004-12-07

In this respect, he certainly rivals Karpov and Kasparov, while his demeanour was more dignified than the latter's. Someone described the essential quality of Botvinnik's style as \\"iron logic\\", and that sums up the games in this collection.<br /><br />A long time has passed since those days, and the names of the players will mostly be unfamiliar. The openings, too, may seem old-fashioned - but there is value in this. It's a chance to learn exactly what can happen if you play such-and-such a move, which nobody does nowadays. Moreover, Botvinnik's methodical building up of positional advantages has never been bettered and will reward patient study.

Books	4	7	7	N	N	Intriguingly different, but slightly perfunctory	My main complaint is that \\"A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah!\\" is far too short. Having gone to the trouble of constructing such a fascinating, and fairly consistent, parallel world, Harrison could have written twice or three times as much about it. Many novels benefit from being vigorously trimmed back, as the removal of excess verbiage helps the action to stand out more clearly. Here, the opposite is the case. Apart from the protagonist, Captain Augustine Washington, there is virtually no characterisation - and even he is little more than a heroic stereotype. And the civilisation and culture of a world in which the American colonies never achieved independence are merely sketched, with overwhelming focus on transport technology.<br /><br />Then again, you can easily zip through the book in a day, and nobody can complain about being bogged down by inessentials. Harrison's artistry allows him to translate us to his alternate universe with a few deft strokes. It is unfair to make comparisons with later novels such as Gibson and Sterling's \\"The Difference Engine\\", which give a more three-dimensional impression of Victorian society. (Anyway, \\"A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah!\\" is set in 1973, although speech patterns and customs are Victorian).<br /><br />Due to the book's consistent focus on the transatlantic tunnel project, the action is rather intermittent. This will not be a problem for anyone who enjoys descriptions of clever technology, though, as possibilities are opened up that have not been explored even in our world. Some of the ideas may seem questionable - for instance, the artificial islands in the Atlantic, with their hotels, shopping precincts and beaches, might not stand up well to the occasional \\"perfect storm\\".<br /><br />All in all, though, a most enjoyable romp and a big contrast to run-of-the-mill \\"space opera\\" science fiction. The introduction by Auberon Waugh and cameo appearances of Messrs Aldiss, Amis and Dick Tracy are a bonus.	2004-12-07

It analyzes 24 games played between 1974 and 1985, in which Nunn took on and beat some chess giants including the Soviet grandmasters Polugaevsky, Vaganian, Korchnoy and Tal. The Polugaevsky game, played at Skara, Sweden in 1980, saw Nunn tear his opponent to shreds in just 32 moves - with the Black pieces, no less! The author describes this Bobby Fischer-like exploit as \\"a veritable witches' cauldron of tactics\\", and gives extensive notes showing the various possibilities at each move.<br /><br />Nunn is one of the world's best annotators, thanks to his excellent calculating ability and merciless quest for objectivity. There is much to be learned from this book and \\"John Nunn's Best Games\\", which takes up the tale in 1985.	2004-12-07

Drawing on a lifetime of experience, he explains the basic ideas in simple, unpretentious language, introducing semantics as the branch of philosophy that deals with meaning. Then he motors on through classification, vocabularies, taxonomies, ontologies; data and object-oriented modeling; state machines, schemas, metadata, natural language processing, business rules, document and knowledge management and much more. McComb ties everything together logically, and proves that it is possible to describe some of the core ideas of software in words that anyone can understand. The last few chapters present some of the latest buzzwords, such as XML, Web services, Service Oriented Architecture, Business Process Management, Enterprise Application Integration and the Semantic Web.<br />This book is very well written, and can be read in a single sitting - its 300 pages took me about five hours, making the occasional note and skipping nothing. When you have finished, there is still more value at the end: a reference section, where all the concepts mentioned in the book are summarised in logical order; an excellent glossary; a &quot;resources&quot; section 30 pages long stuffed with book references, URLs and the like; and a professionally compiled index. The book is well produced, too. Its binding is suitable for frequent use, there are no typos or other careless errors, and the many diagrams are attractive and easy to understand.<br />Anyone who is involved with producing or maintaining software stands to learn something new and useful from reading this book.

As well as the sheer gut-busting humour and insight of his first and best known novel, Lucky Jim, Amis was an excellent story-teller capable of serious reflection about the human condition. He just didn't believe in being pompous and self-important about it. Some of his books - The Anti-Death League, for instance, or The Green Man - serve up a fascinating blend of dry humour, drama, characterisation, philosophy and even suspense.<br /><br />Obviously the man who wrote these books - not forgetting poetry, critical essays and biographies - was himself quite complex. The life and soul of any party, though many were hurt by his scathing wit, Amis was scared of the dark and even being alone, and was apparently prone to sudden attacks of pure existential fear. The tendency to identify him with Lucky Jim, his first and most famous anti-hero, was strengthened by the gradually spreading awareness of the chronic womanising which broke up both his marriages. Yet it seems that Amis much regretted these domestic disasters, conceivably having failed to understand that marriage offers real, though easily overlooked, benefits to husbands as well as wives.<br /><br />Bradford's thesis is simply that, denials to the contrary notwithstanding, all of Amis' fiction is drawn directly from his own life experience. All he manages to demonstrate, however, is the meaninglessness of this position. Of course every author draws on experience for material - otherwise all fiction would be fantasy. When Bradford is reduced to arguing that \\"Simona... has characteristics so completely different from Jane's as to virtually announce themselves as covering devices\\", the poverty of his basic idea is clearly revealed. If a character resembles anyone Amis ever met, he must have copied that character from real life. But if the character is completely different, the same inference is drawn.<br /><br />Otherwise, the book is well written and evidently based on research as thorough as Amis' own (for a surprising rigour was one of his best qualities). This impression is hardly spoiled by occasional infelicities and repetitions - and at least when Bradford revisits the same text twice, he tells the same story each time. Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it will surely encourage any reader to get hold of Amis' novels and read them (or re-read them, as the case may be).<br /><br />Is it evil to smile at the thought of how Amis would have fumed if he could have read the manuscript himself? Not really - it is the sort of joke he would have appreciated, and perhaps accompanied by his famous \\"crazy peasant\\" face.rent, the same inference is drawn.

For instance: how did some assumed (and so far undiscovered) common ancestor give rise to bears and horses? In theory, random mutations happen all the time, and a tiny percentage of them are beneficial. But if no such mutation yields a new variant that cannot interbreed with the main species, how do new species arise? And if it does, how can the new variant survive unless - by some unbelievable coincidence - another identical mutant of the opposite sex is born at the same time and place?<br />One of the hallmarks of a great mind is the confidence to ask questions that the rest of us would be ashamed to ask for fear of exposing ourselves to ridicule. This book forcefully argues that today's scientific orthodoxy can be every bit as stifling and irrational as the religious dogmatism of previous centuries. Surely it is wrong that certain opinions simply cannot be held by practising scientists - if they want to keep their jobs and have their papers published, at any rate?<br />&quot;Our Place in the Cosmos&quot; advances a variety of ideas, all of which are stimulating, although some are more convincing than others. The authors make no bones about the fact that some of their thoughts are speculative - they are only two scientists, backed up up by a small team of researchers, and they have limited time and means. In stark contrast, they claim that the entire community of Darwinian biologists has laboured for 150 years without finding conclusive evidence in the fossil record.<br />The book's most convincing hypothesis is that the universe is stuffed with microorganisms. The comparison of infrared flux from the galactic centre with that from dry E. coli shows a striking similarity, suggesting the existence of interstellar clouds made up of bacteria - dehydrated of course, but potentially viable when introduced to a suitable ecological niche. It is explained that bacteria can survive re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, whereas airless bodies like the Moon swat them like bugs on a windshield. There is also evidence to show that respiratory diseases could be spread by such infalling bacteria (and viruses), whose arrival can be synchronized with the passage of comets.<br />It is impossible to do justice to this thrilling book in a review. If you enjoy scientific thrillers - with the added spice of an apparent conspiracy to ignore the work of misunderstood geniuses - get hold of a copy of &quot;Our Place in the Cosmos&quot;.

At first I was put off by what I saw as extraneous details put in to pad the book out, or as plain bragging. By halfway through I was mellowing, and having finished the book I see it as an artistic whole that was enjoyable on two different levels.<br />Shimomura is clearly a high-flyer, outstanding from an early age, who could more or less pick his own assignments. Like Cliff Stoll, author of the broadly similar book &quot;The Cuckoo's Egg&quot;, he got into computer security more or less as a sideline. The book tells how Kevin Mitnick, a notorious phone phreak and cracker, deliberately broke into Shimomura's computers and stole his files. That set the stage for a classic showdown, although Shimomura did get a lot of help along the way.<br />Until the final stages, remarkably little of that help came from the authorities, partly because the FBI and other agencies seem to have lacked technical expertise. Indeed the book is interesting as a study of how a loose-knit society like the IT establishment reacts to serious threats. If Shimomura's account is believed, not very much would have been accomplished without him.<br />About half the book is given over to &quot;background&quot; details - the author's social life, recreational pursuits (mostly skiing), thumbnail sketches of many computer and California personalities, even exact menus of what he ate and drank. He also explains lots of technical topics in a way that anyone can understand - from patching the Unix kernel to how telephone switches work.<br />It has been suggested that Shimomura staged the whole thing deliberately so that he could make money from this book. Despite his obviously healthy ego, that seems really far-fetched. There are many ways Shimomura could use his time profitably, and frankly writing books is not all that effective a way of becoming rich.<br />I can recommend this book warmly to anyone interested in computer security, or even in how the industry ticks. It also works, in a way, as a kind of detective story in a new key. I hope this is not Shimomura's last book.er security, or even in how the industry ticks.

While a lot has changed since this book was  published - mainly additions and improvements - it still provides the best  explanation you are likely to find. As one of Digital's top technical  writers, the author follows Einstein's advice in simplifying everything as  far as possible, but no further. How authoritative is the book? Well, the  software engineers responsible for maintaining the VMS file system used to  rely on the author as a source of information when they were in doubt, so  you are probably safe to do likewise.	2000-08-24

I would have given 1-2 stars for the book itself,  were it not for the superb framework provided by Frank Herbert in his Dune  series. I felt that the present writers were like toddlers who could not  walk on their own, but managed to stumble along with the aid of a  baby-walker (in the shape of Frank Herbert's richly detailed plot and  background). The unsatisfactory nature of much of the writing is made up  for by the satisfaction of finally learning just what happened (for  instance) to Duncan Idaho as a boy. Characterisation, dialogue, action and  plot all seemed very weak at times, better at others, leading me to wonder  if some fragments of Frank Herbert's own notes might have found their way  into the book. The authors' task is made much more difficult by Frank  Herbert's allusive style, which often hinted expressively without fully  explaining. Yet I feel that this book could have been much better, had  Brian Herbert recruited one of the world's leading writers to collaborate  with him - preferably someone whose style and mindset was closer to Frank  Herbert's. Regretfully, I don't think I will be spending the time and money  to read the other two prequel volumes. As far as I am concerned, Dune -  like its author - can rest in peace.	2000-07-10

Having glanced at the reader reviews &quot;Destination: Void&quot; has collected so far, I cannot pass by on the other side. True, it is 30 years since I read it in college. But it is still among the best ten books I have  ever read - and I have read many thousands since then. The difficulty is  that it is deliberately aimed at a rather limited audience. In a world of  commercialism run wild, this is refreshing indeed.<br />Herbert does not  complicate matters wilfully, but on the other hand he makes no concessions  whatsoever to his readers' ignorance. He assumes that they are interested  both in technology and in the problems of existence, consciousness and  religion. There should be plenty of people like that out there, right?  Maybe they are all too busy doing useful work to read SF novels!<br />The  upside is that Herbert is a real expert, and even allowing for the 30 years  that have elapsed (a huge chasm in terms of technical progress) this book  is vastly superior to the schlock that passes for SF today. The Tin Egg has  the authentic feel of an experimental interstellar spaceship, whereas  starship Enterprise is basically a flying playpen.<br />As for the science, it  isn't too clear just where the facts leave off and the fiction sets in -  and that is good, too. Suffice it to say that we still aren't any closer to  cracking artificial intelligence yet, let alone artificial consciousness.  (See Heinlein's &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; for another  approach to the latter). So Herbert's speculations have hardly dated at  all.<br />Personally, I rate &quot;Destination: Void&quot; as Herbert's best  book, ahead of Dune, The Dragon in the Sea (Under Pressure), Dune Messiah,  and The Dosadi Experiment. A matter of taste, I guess.	1999-11-24
US	53078177	R2A45YVRIEARO9	0345327594	266981481	Wasp	Books	5	20	21	N	N	Pacific War transferred to a galactic stage	Since I first read it (and Russell's other brilliant books such as Men, Martians and Machines and Three to Conquer) in my early teens, I have regarded Wasp as one of the true SF classics. It ranks with Bester's The Demolished Man and Tiger! Tiger!, as well as the best of Clarke and Heinlein, although its sardonic tone has more in common with Robert Sheckley.<br /><br />Although set in a future a few centuries ahead, when Earth is at war with the Sirian Combine, Wasp is directly transplanted from conventional warfare of the Second World War era. Indeed, I don't know why it took so long to dawn on me that the Sirians are analogues of the Japanese (as stereotyped by many Americans in the immediate aftermath of WW2), while the noble Earthmen are essentially 1950s Americans (as stereotyped by themselves). Oh sure, the Sirians are purple instead of yellow - but they are short, bandy-legged, and fanatical. To clinch it, their dreaded secret police is called the Kaitempi: compare the actual Japanese Kampeitei.<br /><br />The Sirians have a great advantage in numbers, but the Earthmen are smarter. How to make the most of their quicker wits and superior technology? One way is to drop secret agents behind enemy lines to sow confusion, dissension and destruction. The result is dramatic, convincing and (in parts) riotously funny. Some of the dialog stays with you for life, such as this immortal parody of a government communique: \\"For months we have been making triumphant retreats before a demoralised enemy who is advancing in utter disorder\\".	1999-07-24
