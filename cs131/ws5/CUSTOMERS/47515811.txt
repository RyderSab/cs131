First I liked the off beat format of ongoing narrative, with poems and short stories in between. Each of the characters from Miss America, Mrs. Baglady and SaintGutFree just to name a few are outrageous parodies of everyday people or at least those people we claim that we are not like. They are victimized and in turn victimize others basically. They lie, cheat, steal and murder for their fifteen minutes of fame and when they fall down or die, you have absolutely no sympathy for them. You just marvel at their ruthlessness and how people in general are easily taken in by an idea a passion and no one seems to have any redeeming inner virtue. RevernedGodless' poem was pretty good, his story pretty twisted but perhaps the most disgusting short story was the one by DirectorDenial. I won't spoil anything for you. But I recommend this book,it's my first Palahniuk book and it won't be my last.	2005-06-29

I can't say that I want to \\"Be Like Burroughs\\" because there were some instances in this novel Cities of the Red Night (and others) where I thought he was on the verge of losing his mind. The stories span from homo-erotic pornography to violent surrealism but his talent was obvious. There are political messages on the nature of freedom and individualism, however an average reader could easily be distracted by but all of the surreal imagery and sexual situations. Yet I recommend that you read Naked Lunch first before reading this book.	2005-06-21

This book was entertaining as well as highly informative. Going into details about zombie attacks and classifying them by degree and class of outbreak. There are details about what should be done and shouldn't be, the advantages and disadvantages of weapons and battle tactics(if necessary) the main goal is survival and unlike in the movies, these zombies are the result of a viral outbreak, not some magic spell or demonic possession, these are zombies that won't stop coming until either they are destroyed or you end up being zombie chow. This book was written with a seriousness that's almost comical but terrifying when you think about it. And with what's going on these days, a sudden zombie outbreak wouldn't surprise me in the least.	2005-05-24

I am sort of a moderate (yeah okay) but I lean toward the liberal side of the fence on social issues. But Ann seems to be out for blood in this book. I counldn't finish it because I found myself reading the rants of a person firmly convinced of her viewpoint. We use to have a term for people like this though I've given over calling Radical Leftist wackos and Radical Right wingers Fascists, I can say that Ann has at least taught me that there are people out there who are absolute in their views and vehemently so. This very intelligent woman (I'll grant her that) recently mentioned that Canadians ought to appreciate the fact that we haven't crushed them yet. I mean really! Attitudes like this have motivated people to commit massacres and lynchings through out history. I mean I am not saying Ann Coulter isn't an intelligent individual but she seems to lack tactful social skills that you're supposed to learn at the age of 10. She doesn't seem to speak or forward her political opinions in an intelligent manner. In the book she seems almost sophomoric about it all. And it's really sad because she's probably a good person, certainly a good American, but she seems well, Hitler-esqe in how she presents her views. What else is there to expect from a Fox News pundit but really?	2004-12-01

Basically this story is about a bunch of inbred hicks stumbling across Nyarlethotep,\\"The Crawling Darkness\\" and then worshipping him as a god and kidnapping hapless tourists who pass through or by their ramshackle village somewhere in back woods of Missouri. I won't give away the particulars of the plot to ruin the experience for you but I must say that this short novel was extremely gory. It was like watching one of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. This and a major figure within the Cthulhu Mythos is used. A definite must read for fans of the Cthulhu Mythos!	2004-08-15

Considering the author's recent revelation of lying about his past as a Army Ranger has cast a pale shadow over this book of antiwar posts. Whether you adopt a liberal or conservative point of view. You have to consider that the author was lying about his military record and experiences in 1989 Panama that never happened, in fact he was never in the military. I sympathize with his political stance but it's difficult to support this book in good conscience. It certainly gives a political black eye to people who adopt similar political views.	2004-08-15

I plan on reading it again and I am sure to get something new out of it. As other reviewers have commented, the stories of the customers of BAILEY'S CAFE are sad, inspirational and funny at the sametime. I've heard that all the customers are actually dead, ghosts caught in bewteen life and death. There was a hint of this when I first read it but I didn't quite pick up on it. Well, I have yet to any other novel from Naylor. This novel talks about issues of racism, class status and there's a little religion and philosophy intertwined in the mix. A great read!	2004-06-19

HELL TO PAY is an action novel from beginning to end with a great deal of substance in between. I didn't read any of the Derek Strange books in order. I read this novel after reading SOUL CIRCUS. I found out how Terry Quinn got that scar on his face from his run in with a seemingly larger than life pimp named Worldwide. The character Terry seems a lot more developed in this novel than in SOUL CIRCUS. This novel develops both characters personal lives such that they actually seem more like three dimensional characters. I've yet to read HARD REVOLUTION to find out the connection between Granville Oliver's father and Strange. Granville Oliver is the fictional drug kingpin introduced towards the end of this novel who figures more prominently in SOUL CIRCUS. I found this novel a joy to read it's a serial novel but newcomers to the series can pick up any of the Derek Strange novels and start from any point in the series.	2004-06-08

I read this novel after reading SOUL CIRCUS and this was one of the prequels to that novel which unfortunately is probably the last novel that the character Terry Quinn will appear in. RIGHT AS RAIN introduces Derek Strange and Terry Quinn and the origins of their friendship and their differences (other than race) that they often have to contend with. I would have to say that Terry Quinn is a more developed character in this novel than in SOUL CIRCUS but I have yet to read HELL TO PAY which next on my reading list.  The story is fast paced and gritty. Washington, DC is described with every brutal and gritty detail. It reads like a postmodern Chester Himes novel. A clear distinction of good and evil in some instances but also grey and shady areas where the lines are not so easily drawn. Quinn is actually a likable character in this novel.	2004-05-15

But I read this book because it takes place in Washington, DC, and the author is also a Washingtonian. I throughly enjoyed this book but I don't think the character Terry Quinn was well rounded. He just seemed like a stereotypical angry white male who can't seem to understand &quot;street life&quot;. It's not like living in Beirut when you live in Anacostia nor is it a place you want to get caught in walking at night when you're not from around there. Though I found Quinn more interesting than the protagonist Private Investigator Derek Strange, mostly because Quinn played an oddball. He was made out to be at least somewhat knowledgable in what he was doing since he was a former District cop. Then again I was mystified as to why he couldn't figure out how to navigate the urban territories to find this missing girl he was looking for. I found this a little annoying, I mean you don't walk up to people with a gun when you don't plan on shooting them. His death (or possible death?) could've been avoided if he wasn't so stupid in the end. Overall I enjoyed reading this book and look forward to reading another book with Derek Strange as the main character.	2004-04-11

I slept with the light on for a whole month after reading it. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this book so much. It's a quick read but there's so much substance to it. The dead are possessed by some evil from the pits of Hell under the command of Legion a demon who plays the role of some dark messiah. The zombies are quick and intelligent not like George Romero's zombies. The zombies in this book don't attack the living out of a hunger to feed but out of deep maliciousness, and for purely sadistic purposes. They like to torture their prey before killing them and adding then adding them to their unholy, undead army. The end of the world scenerio very realistic and quite possible if you consider the underlying religious theme that sorta runs through the novel. The debate between an atheist who in the past murdered his ex-wife and buried her in a basement (his second wife was in on it to and was subsequently murdered by his zombie ex-wife) to be particularly humorous. It was a sense of &quot;poetic justice&quot; but it serves as sort of an injoke. Well I don't want to give away the whole story, but some of the survivors of the initial dead onslaught are so annoying that when a few of them are taken out, I couldn't help but smile a bit. It's a great book if you're into zombie movies. The zombies in this book are more like deadites from the Evil Dead Trilogy!	2004-04-11

For one there is a stark realism to the stories interwoven into one story about the struggles of a dysfunctional family starting with the plight of it's matriarch Ruby Washington feeling the violent racism of Norma, South Carolina with her half brother Easton &quot;Love&quot; Childers to Oakland, California. And this is just the beginning. Each character seems to go through a kind of odyessey to arrive at either a dead end (such as in Easton and Lida's case) or with a new beginning. I think this book is mostly about change and how a family struggles with the harsh world given their severe disadvantages. There is a surprise ending that reminded me that people can change no matter what direction they are going into. The &quot;two brothers&quot; on the bus trip was absolutely esstential to the novel as it drew to a close. I don't want to give away too much. This was an excellent novel! I warn you in advance.  You'll probably cry a little at the ending!	2003-10-23

A nice vacation from reading about the romatic vampire, or the postmodern vampire who is a rockstar and is far too effeminate to take seriously. Matheson's vampire is a filthy corspe who is not quick footed or witted and is basically a zombie only the passion is for blood and not brains. The struggle of the protagonist Neville is both heartfelt and realistic. A great book from beginning to end!	2003-07-12

This book was an exceptional read for anyone into not too coy satire about religion, the devil, and all the other absurd oddball characters associated with diety worship. It paints society out to be absurd too but the author, this psycho-beat-realist was on something when he wrote this besides being just a cynical so and so.

US	47515811	RLEB0C5NFETN6	0452269652	522305574	Jazz	Books	5	2	4	N	Y	An Underappreciated Novel	After having read this novel I can't believe all the negative reviews, most people claiming that the novel was too hard or difficult to follow. I've read 4 of Morrison's books (The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon, Sula and Beloved) and I'll have to say that enjoyed this one amensely and I pretty much read over a span of three days. It's not a difficult read, nor is it difficult to follow if you've read any of her before or read Hemmingway, Faulkner or Kerouac for that matter. On a second reading of any of Morrison's novels, you always come away with something new, as with any quality piece of literature. So I really don't buy into this idea that Morrison's novels, this one in particular are difficult to read.<br />This being said, I found this novel to be a great pleasure, a story that's simple enough about a middle-aged married black couple The Traces in &quot;the City&quot; during 1920's the husband Joe Trace has a fling with a young girl named Dorcas Manfred whom he later kills in the middle of party though the girl's Aunt/Guardian doesn't press charges and the wife Violet &quot;Violent&quot; Trace tries to disfigure the dead girl in the casket at her funeral. That's basically it without giving away the novel. There is an almost sensual use of language here that tells the stories behind the story that is common in Morrison's novels that gives Jazz that particular kind of flavor that distinguishes it from Morrison's other works and makes this novel more than a pleasure to read. I highly recommend it!	2003-02-22

I felt drawn to Chip and his \\"fall from grace\\" due to succumbing to the charms (more like annoyance) of Melissa a student of his during his other life as a college professor. Well he screwed that one up now didn't he! And throughout the novel the characters seem to have their dreams and illusions of life, never really focusing on reality. And there's the comparision between Chip and his more succesful brother who just happens to be manically depressed despite that success. I don't want to give away the whole book but it's really good read as far as a character study (almost like a case study). The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was that reading through some dry spells in the novel took some patience other than that this novel comes highly recommended!	2003-02-15

Though it's focused on the life and times of Malik Solanka the main character and reading this novel I identified closely with Malik who leaves his wife and child for New York City to well...lose himself and deal with his &quot;fury&quot;. A form of anger that only the person feeling it can understand. It's like your own personal anger and it's understandable that only you can understand it as it pertains to your personal experiences. Well, Malik seems to play a passive observer to the general absurdity of human society which in part infuriates him at the same time this anger keeps him on the sideline. The other characters don't seem to be fully developed the seem more like personas than actual people but now I am just being picky.  This novel carried on more like a Woody Allen film but infinitely more interesting.	2003-02-13

I have purchased this book twice to give away as presents to people whom I believed would benefit from reading it. I plan to purchase a third copy just to have but I think everyone needs to read this book. This book changed my whole outlook on life but the information, truth and knowledge therein is emotionally hard to swallow. I mean to say that it's &quot;deep&quot; is the understatement of the year. Being in the military, I am doing my little part to keep this mad spectacle of civilization going. Jensen points out that it's kinda hopeless to change the world at this point. And I've tried my best even though I am cynical, to believe that we can still turn things around and save ourselves but it's pretty hopeless.<br />I would rate this book as being more important than the Bible. I say this not to be sacreligious or crass, but as an honest heartfelt statement. Jenson attempted to discover the origin of hate, to analyze the condition of hatred as manisfested throughout American History. I really can't describe the impact of this book. It's highly recommended.	2003-01-18

To limit Richard Wright's autobiography to accounts of racism in the South during the 30's and 40's is overlook the fact that Richard Wright was more than just an African American author, he was novelist, essayist and political analyst whose prose still has bearing on topics of cultural identity and personal identity, topics we still deal with today.<br />Racism seems to be issue with an immortal lifespan because everytime we're on the verge of giving it the death blow, we walk away and pretend that we've killed it by ignoring it. There are issues of identity and individualty in Black Boy that even provokes questions of victim status among those who are quick to claim that they have been racially discriminated against (Damon Cross from The Outsider for example).  I've read this book twice and I am the process of reading it again. Richard's childhood was sheer hell, I mean his grandmother was psychotic!! He was from a dysfunctional family, Well there's a smorgasborg of issues going on with him in the beginning. His failed hopes and dreams. However I really enjoyed reading about his trials in Chicago.  I recently went to Chicago for the first time and I felt like I knew the place. His time with the Communist Party was especially interesting. It was like he was battling for his individualty. He ultimately leaves the Communist Party after it is made clear to him that he was being used as were many of the poor blacks who were in the Communist Party ranks as tokens. Very good read!

I've overlooked it many times in the bookstore but since I've purchased it, I don't regret it. Since reading it, I've come to understand the driving force behind gangs: the sense of family. Many of the gang members including the author himself profiled in this book came from broken homes where there wasn't necessarily a shortage of love as much as there was a lack of positive structure and bonding and of course the positive father figure.<br />  \\"Monster\\" Kody Scott or rather Shakur is honest and unforgiving in the tale of his troubled youth and his rise to knowledge of self and self love for himself, his wife, children and community. Though this book is dated, much of the racism of which he was a victim whether legimitately (how could it ever be legimate?) or not still persist today in 2002.

Old Ivan is not accepted by other prominent historians I gather and not mentioned at all in polite conversations at grant award parties or community college faculty lounges but he's got theories that are at least worth exploring, I mean the History Channel rarely shows anything about black history that doesn't involve Dr. King Jr. or the Klan, I mean come on folks, black history didn't start with American slavery and didn't end with the Civil Rights Movement but isn't it ever so comforting to think so? Ivan, Diop, and many others have sacrificed their reputations trying to show that dark skinned peoples have a rich history that spans the globe a thousand times over before the West was considered the homestead of civilization.

This not exactly kiddie material but it's one of those books to read like the biograghy of Malcolm X (or was it autobigraphy), that's essential to read if you're a black man, or just a man in general.  I don't want to limit this book to just one sect of people. This book is real, I mean REAL.  When I was in college I used to hear about \\"trains\\" so much, that I thought guys were referring to a girl's name.  Unfortunately trains still occur so how far has society evolved really?  Women are still considered objects rather than our grandmothers, mothers, sisters, strong rolemodels and just plain people and this book is somewhat brutal in regards to women but the protagonist (the author) comes to an understanding of this and realizes how wrong it is, but he didn't write this book in order to really apologize for his past, he wants to teach others by telling readers about his mistakes. Hopefully we'll get wise from his mistakes and not have to go through some of the drama he went through.  Pick this book up if you're interested in \\"man studies\\".	2002-04-21

I read Invisible Man twice but anyway Song of Solomon is another must read and being in the military and enlisted (d'oh!) there aren't any people I can really discuss this book with other than a few officers who have nothing to do throughout the day so must read something to maintain their sanity and sense. This particular officer was non-black I should say but everybody is black really and you don't have to be black to relate to a story of pain, ambition, and family strife.  Yes I would recommend this book to a 10th grader and make it required reading.  Morrison is telling a story she's not trying to save the world here folks. Though many thought that she ought to have kept Paradise to herself, I've rarely found reading anything Morrison wrote to be disappointing.	2002-04-14

However, I was disappointed by this book for different reasons perhaps than others have found this book to their dislike.  I was nauseated by the portrayal of black men in this novel! Black men in the Bluest Eye are irresponsible, sex-crazed, child molesting, drunks and this is just in the first couple of chapters.  Though a case could be argued that black men are not portrayed in a REALISTIC light in any medium,I must say that I kind of expected more from this exceptional writer!	2000-12-29

My mistake but really this is not a very good book and to say it's &quot;analytical&quot; is to overlook most of it's major flaws. It's overview of the Civil Rights Movement is too general, excluding in particular Malcolm X who I suppose was just an angry black man and for some crazy reason saw &quot;devils&quot; everywhere. But Dr. King Jr. is mentioned up and down, not as an activist as he truly was but as a humble, pacifist who begged racists to change their ways.<br />I found this book to kind of an insult considering that there were more African Americans involved in the Civil Rights Movement and that most of us were not passive agents, waiting for Dr. King to have his &quot;dream&quot;.  The authors should have done a more in depth study instead of this elementary effort.	2000-12-29

I expected a complete and drawn out compendium of the Cthulhu Mythos, what I got was a confusing mesh mash of useless information.  This weirdo was actually working on the premise that the Cthulhu cult is real or was real.  Perhaps there members of the Cthulhu cult running around performing blaspemous rites. Who knows? If they are this book won't help you much.	2000-10-28
