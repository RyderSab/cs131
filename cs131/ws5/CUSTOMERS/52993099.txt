If you want jump inside this field (\\"secure code\\"), then take the book by the hand and go ahead.    Well written and very pedagogic, the book is useful even for experts. The only limitation (clearly stated in the back cover) is the full orientation toward the Microsoft's .NET platform (and of course the Windows/Intel realm).    Some chapters should be more deeply analyzed and the chapter 8  (Reversing Malware) is somewhat naive.     Even so, overall . . . 5 stars.     If you are in \\"secure code\\", this book is a MUST.    p.s. As an added value the book is so self-contained (no external sources needed) and so complete, that can be used as a quick but sufficient introduction to computer system architectures. To know more about the book try the \\"Search Inside\\" feature in this same page.	2005-04-19

If yes, perhaps you may already know that there are two main kinds of IDS's: based on \\"known bad behavior or abuse\\" or based on \\"behavior deviation\\".    The first kind is very well known after several popular implementations like SNORT.On the plus side they are not prone to \\"false positives\\" but, however,on the minus side they are almost useless with new forms of attacks.    The second kind, in turn, is very prone to false positives and not yet well implemented, but eventually can handle quite well unexpected or new forms of attacks.    If you are interested in this second type of IDS's then \\"Investigative Data Mining for Security and Criminal Detection\\" is a MUST.    From basic definitions to a case study, you are leaded through a wonderful tour that includes among others:     Intelligent Agents  Text Mining  Neural Networks  Machine Learning   Criminal Patterns  Intrusion Detection    So, if you are just casually interested in \\"behavior deviation\\" based IDS's or a true researcher in related areas, this book undoubtedly will be useful and of great help.	2003-10-18

I mean 'perl scripts', cross site and traversal attacks, hackers jargon, and all the related issues..... then buy 'Hacking Web Applications Exposed' by Scambray and Shema. Excellent book too, and excellent authors. But beware, it is not for newbies. You MUST have a lot of background to fully understand the attacks.<br />Now, what about an easier generic book, covering the same issues as the others but in a step by step and kinder way.? A book to start from zero, but leading to understand all the currently related themes. Well, if this is what you want, then 'Web Hacking' is your book. It covers all that need to be covered in this area. In an easy and well structured way. The reading is very light and the authors 'break down' of the matter, makes the contents very intuitive.<br />The book is structured into four main sections (covering the same areas as the previously referred books) :<br />** The E-commerce Playground <BR>** URLs Unraveled<BR>** How Do They Do It?<BR>** Advanced Web Kung Fu<br />It includes also, several interesting appendixes (specially useful the 'cheat sheet' appendix).<br />A lot of simple case studies (of the kind 'Bob and Alice') are presented as well as some more technical analyses (Code Red, Nimda etc.)<br />If I were to select a book as a reference for a first course on web security, 'Web Hacking' would be my choise.

It is not worse or better than other similar books. It is just the only serious book around.(on these issues). Perhaps you could compare it with 'Know your Enemy' (KyE) but then 'Tracking Hackers' would win hands down. After all, about the same content of KyE can be found in the pages of 'The Honeynet Project'. Of course KyE is more concise and organized (than the site), easier to use for understanding Honeynets, and several original attacks are discussed in the book. A good book indeed.<BR> <BR>However,  HTH is very special, because for the first time there is an extensive discussion about Honeypots, in a unique document (book). And it is very well written. From beginners to experts everybody will enjoy the book. Every single detail is clearly and patiently explained and fitted in the honeypots puzzle. The case studies are clever and representative. The Honeypots are classified according their level of interaction, and treated following the same sequence: BOF, Specter, Honeyd, Man Trap, and 'Home Made' Honeypots (including Jailed Environments) are thoroughly analyzed. <br />Even Honeynets are discussed, and an significative case study is used to 'put all together'.<BR>As a bonus the related 'legal issues' are also discussed (new to me).<BR>At the bottom line it is an excellent book not only for reading (beginners and intermediates), but also for being used by experts as a reference in Security Courses (just what I am planning to do).	2002-09-18

I was wondering how such people could have written such book. Not that the book was worthless, but too 'standard' to met the expectations I had from these guys.<BR>Still the idea was very interesting (information directly from the real experts), and I kept waiting for a new edition.<BR>Well the second edition is now out, and not only fulfills, but exceeds all my original expectations !!<br />Let's take a look:<br />The Approach:<br />Understanding attacks and vulnerabilities, by understanding 'how to hack' (good hacking of course. . . .ahem )<br />The Book:<br />Rewritten, expanded and improved, the book consists of 800+ pages well structured into 18 chapters (against 450+ pages and 15 chapters of the first edition).<BR>Well written, well presented, with a real fancy table of contents, the chapters include url's, a FAQ section and a SOLUTIONS FAST TRACK one.<BR>A lot of CLEVER code is included as well as helpful 'Tool & Traps' and 'Notes from the Underground. . .

Only quite easier.<BR>I got more than 60 papers on buffer overflows. None compares with the classical 'Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit' by Aleph One. IMHO, however,the corresponding chapter from this book, does compare and is really easier to understand.<BR>Finally, the 'piece de resistance' of the book, is the chapter about Spoofing. Really enjoyed it, and by the way got surprised reading the innovative (to me) technique to 'Spoof Connectivity Through Asymmetric Firewalls'.

Chapters related to Signal Encoding and Spread Spectrum are really well written, and 802.11 and Bluetooth fundamentals are fully explained.<BR>Even if several parts of the book are taken (with little or none modifications) from other Stallings' books, the book is still worth to have since this fact makes it a completely self-contained reference.	2002-02-16

Several parts were rewritten to improve understanding (e.g. RIP solutions) and a lot of modern technologies are now discussed, including Mobile IP, IPsec, VPNs, IP Multicasting, Voice and Video over IP, and IP Telephony. <BR>It is worth every dollar of its price.	2002-02-09

I recommend it to my students as a quick introduction to Wlans. You can read it easily in one night or a weekend. Yet, don't let this claim  fool you. Even if concise, the book covers all the essential information to give you a very good understanding of Wlans.	2002-01-21

I usually buy only network security books. However, I felt tempted by the high ratings and bought this book. Well, the more I read it the more I like it. Well written, comprehensive and up to date, it is a sort of rich jumping table for finding additional information about the issues it already covers. Part two and three, are wonderful complements for people interested in 'traditional computer security'. I believe that any security administrator should be familiar with the issues discussed in those parts.<BR>I specially enjoyed the Multilevel Security and Multilateral Security chapters. <BR>Full of references, the book is well worth to have a place between your 'special books'. I plan to use it as a reference in my next  security courses (for graduate students).	2002-01-20

If you are interested in computer forensics, this one is the book. Excellent, just like I expected to be a book from the honeynet project people. Buy this book, and it will be the only reference needed to enter the forensic arena.<br />Pros: <BR>- The only book seriously covering Honeynets and Honeypots.<BR>- Several real cases fully analyzed.<BR>- Tons. of forensic data included in the companion CD.<br />Cons:<BR>- Of the 328 pages, only the first 150 are really worthy, the rest are just fillers.  <br />My only additional wish is a future edition including Windows Systems forensics.	2002-01-19

There are books, special books and VERY special books.<BR>The STEVENS 'Tcp/Ip Illustrated Vol I', is (as you surely know) a very special book. 'Counter Hack' deserves the same qualification.<BR>Well written and structured, this book covers all classic issues about computer security, as well as very actual and interesting topics like 'IDS Evasion' and  'Rootkits'.<BR>The summary of chapter 4 (Windows NT/2000 Overview) and the whole Chapter 12 (Anatomy of an Attack) are both masterpieces.<BR>Chapter 11 (Covering Tracks and Hiding) is a welcome extra (rarely found in similar books), and in every chapter several useful security tools are discussed in detail (and the related URL shown).<BR>From beginners to experts, this book is a valuable reference for everyone. I own about 30 'computer security' books, and actually could discard 25 with no significant losses (aging and excessive repetition). Of course, if this were the case, 'Counter Hack' would be one of the 5 survivors.	2002-01-06

Even worse is to compare it with Spafford and Garfinkel's `Practical Unix and Internet Security', a true classic. <BR>White-Hat Security Arsenal:... is a trivial and outdated book. Bad structured and totally useless even for beginners.<BR>Don't throw your money away. Buy books like 'Hacking Exposed' if you are interested in the basics of computer security.	2001-12-24

OK, I did it again, I bought another useless 'hackers book'. As before, it is basically my fault, since I chose to (by my own free will). Unlike before, however, the disappointment is a lot higher, since the authors (I know their works) are capable of a far better product. It can be the diversity of styles, or some kind of auto censure, or whatever, but the book looks basically naive, and the content is very weak. It seems to me as if while trying to be formal, the authors banalized and/or obscured the issues under discussion. The bottom line is a mosaic of generic topics that you can easily find (better treated) following common security links. As for the claims of Mr. Russell (back cover), besides being truly OPTIMISTIC, they seem like referring to a different book! I am still amazed by a the fact that he can really believe that after reading the book, the term 'blind spoof' will be correctly understood! Half page of obscure information (using a non-representative example) with at least a misplaced term, doesn't seem the way to explain this kind of spoof (you can find better information in Morris original document). Besides, the 'explanation' aims to describe some scanning possibilities instead of real blind attacks. Not a mention to modern forms of prevention (e.g., Syn-Cookies, Firewalling, etc.).<BR>Still a good idea, I keep looking forward for a 'better' second edition.<br />Note1: The original of this review deserved 21 helpful votes. Unfortunately when I edited it to correct misspellings, Amazon reset the counter :-((<BR>Note2: The second edition is now out (March 2002), and for what I know, it seems to be a very useful and up to date publication. :-))	2000-08-26

Submission) Macintosh owners, read this before buying:	I already own the whole set of (excellent) books,  nevertheless I bought the CD basically to get the added benefit of direct access searching. Alas, I lost the money. I use an iMAC to do my research works. Well it turned out  that the search engine included in the CD doesn't work directly, but uses a  tricky TCP/IP connection against a 'search server' written in Java. In my  iMAC (that I keep completely updated) it just doesn't work. First, you need  a connection of some sort (even simulated) to resolve the  localhost/127.0.0.1 pair (as MAC TCP doesn't use a Host table). If (and  when) the server starts, it sends erroneous results to the browser (spaces  are interpreted as delimiters so that 'System Folder is passed as 'System'  thus causing the browser to be unable of find the right location). The  server fails under MRJ 2.1 and MRJ 2.1.1 (it even fails to correctly  install the preferences). A short letter to ORA just obtained the well  known 'not our fault but of the server (external) implementors'...and 'very  hard efforts to implement it on Macintosh'!?. Otherwise the port to HTML is  excellent.	1999-04-10
