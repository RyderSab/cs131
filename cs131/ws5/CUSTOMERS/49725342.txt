In just a few days Morgan has discovered Wicca, fallen in love and fought with her best friend. Now it seems that everything she has believed about herself and her family for the last sixteen years is about to be exposed as a lie...<BR> <BR>I've gotta say I liked this book a lot more than I did \\"Book of Shadows\\". Initially, I didn't find the characters that interesting (take into account I prefer my heroines full of attitude in the Susannah \\"The Mediator\\" Simon style) or the relationships between them that realistic. One thing I do love, however, is the information on Wicca. Since beginning this series I have started reading up about it on the Internet, and while I can't see myself becoming a witch in the foreseeable future (perfectly happy being agnostic thanks very much) this series has helped to change my perceptions of the whole idea. <br />Overall, I would award this book four and a half stars.  Definitely recommended to any fans of Wicca and I promise the ending will leave you desperate for the third book in the series.<br />~Jenna~<BR>(who is now starting to get addicted to these Sweep books and seriously regretting having started reading them)	2002-08-26

As a practising Wiccan, Cal invites several kids, including Morgan, to a party where they will celebrate the sabbat \\"Mabon\\". As they form a Wiccan circle, Morgan begins to feel powers she did not knew she possessed, and soon she is wondering if the magick is choosing her...<br />This novel is a more accurate portrayal of witchcraft than most and does not sensationalise it as some similar books do. \\"Book of Shadows\\" is a quick and interesting read that holds your attention throughout. My one complaint is that I didn't find the characters (excluding Cal) that interesting. However, I will be looking out for the next book in the series to see how the story develops. A definite must-read for any one interested in, or looking to learn about, Wicca.	2002-07-24

As identical twins born with magic powers but then separated to keep them safe, Alexandra Fielding and Camryn Barnes have no idea of the other's existence. In terms of personality, they are completely difficult: Alex is sharp and sarcastic; Cam is smart and popular, but each hides a secret: Alex hears the words people think but don't say, while Cam predicts events before they happen. If the two were to meet, their magical potential would be incredible, and predictably, this book chronicles what happens when the twins finally discover each other's existence after a chance encounter at a theme park...<br />After reading this book, I have one major complaint: the dialogue. I can't seriously believe that anyone in the real world really talks this way: every second word seemed to be slang and \\"So\\", \\"Like\\" and \\"Totally\\" were completely overused. Also: the sub-plot involving the missing pop-star just didn't really add anything and some of the characters (particularly the twins' respective friends) were a little annoying. Anyway, apart from these points, this was a quick, fun read and I think I'll probably read the next instalments in the series if and when they appear in my library. But no, after reading this I was not filled with an overwhelming compulsion to rush out and buy the next book and I don't imagine I'll want to re-read \\"The Power of Two\\". I wouldn't think anyone over the age of twelve would find much challenge in reading this, although the teenspeak can take some time to figure out. Older readers interested in Wicca should try Cate Tiernan's \\"Sweep\\" series.<br />~Jenna~	2002-07-16

Having been plagued by these spirits for the past fourteen years, Suze had hoped that moving from New York City to a quiet town in Northern California would offer her a fresh start. However, the moment she steps into her new bedroom, Suze knows that that isn't going to happen, because she finds herself sharing her room with a 150-year-old ghost of a boy named Jesse. Not only that, but the first day of school brings more trouble: Susannah's locker comes accompanied by the ghost of a girl who killed herself and who is now out for revenge on her ex-boyfriend. Suze is determined to persuade the girl to pass on, but when it seems the usual methods aren't working, will more unconventional action be required?<br />Shadowland, the first book in the series, is one I really recommend as an ideal book for any teens into fiction with a supernatural theme. I found it impossible to put down and can't wait to get started on the next instalment in the series. Definitely worth five stars.<br />~Jenna~	2002-06-24

I have been collecting Star Trek: TNG calendars for four years now, and this 2002 edition is definitely one of the better ones. The photos alone make it deserving of a five star rating. All three TNG movies are covered, as well as several episodes from the series' run. There is an individual photo of each character, some group shots and a fantastic Enterprise-D poster in the centre. I love the layout and the picture quality is great, but this calendar is probably more suited to display than for practical uses such as noting down appointments. As soon as the year is over I will be cutting the calendar up and using each page as a poster on my bedroom wall. This is definitely a must-have for all TNG fans.<br />~Jenna~	2001-10-20

So far most reviews for this book have been extremely negative, but I have to say I don't think it was all that bad. The characterization isn't as great as it could be and some of the descriptions of Moya are way off. Despite this, the aliens aboard Jansz's ship are vivid and imaginative and there's plenty going on. I read \\"Dark Side of the sun\\" straight through in about two hours. The star of the show is Rygel, re-united with an old love-interest, but the rest of the crew all feature. The plot is fairly complex and sometimes gets incredible confusing, especially the parts about Re, the planet/cloud/whatever it was. <br />Overall, this would probably work better as a slightly zany stand-alone sci-fi adventure. If you're looking for accurate characterisation and detail, then it might be wise to look elsewhere. However, if you just want a fun, easy read with a few vague connections to Farscape, then give this a try. I absolutely love Farscape, and to be honest, no matter how bad a book was I would still enjoy it because it gives me chance to spend time in the `Scaper universe with the characters. Farscape fans should also check out \\"House of Cards\\" by Keith RA DeCandido - a book that will restore anyone's faith in the series novel tie-ins. <br />--Jen	2001-09-29

In the late twenty first century a gene was created that enabled human beings to connect directly with computers, to access information in systems all over the world. Now, three hundred years later, the Hexes are being hunted down by the government and systematically exterminated. Raven is one such Hex. Together with her brother Wraith, she has come to London to seek her sister Rachel, who may or may not be a Hex herself. Along with street kid Kez and Ali, a spoilt, rich Hex, Wraith and Raven hunt for clues to Rachel's whereabouts - a search that will lead them to a CPS laboratory, built for the purpose of research into the Hex gene and for testing and exterminating the Hexes themselves.<br />The first instalment in a trilogy, Hex is a compelling mix of action and sci-fi that will keep you reading until the very end. The pace is incredible, the action is non-stop and the atmosphere is so convincing that you can really imagine travelling through twenty fourth century London. The characters, particularly Raven herself, are fascinating and memorable and really bring this futuristic world to life. I can't wait to read the remaining books - Hex: Shadows and Hex: Ghosts - in the trilogy. Definitely recommend to all teen sci-fi fans.	2001-09-02

Both Amy and Eric are thrilled at the opportunity to try all sorts of extreme sports such as rock-climbing, rafting and hand-gliding, but Tasha isn't so sure. The three are teamed up together in a group with two cousellors and three other kids: Brooke, beautiful, sporty and boy-mad; Willard, forced to take the course by his parents and totally unsuited to the activities, and Andy, who displays an incredible talent for sport that is almost equal to Amy's own. <br />Immediately things start to go wrong at the camp. Eric is angry with Amy for continually showing him up in the activities, Tasha struggles to conquer her fears and Amy is finding herself more and more attracted to Andy without knowing why. It isn't long before a freak accident takes place, convincing Amy that someone is out to get them and that the whole camp is in danger...<br />\\"And the two shall meet\\" is the sixth instalment in the Replica series and was even better than the last one I read (#5 Secret Clique).

In the aftermath of the Dominion War a fragile peace exists between the Romulans and the Federation and now that could all be about to change. Throughout the galaxy, subspace disturbances are causing havoc as ships are stranded and Starbases are losing the power they need to function. Worse, these \\"dead zones\\" are multiplying at a terrific rate and soon the populations of the alpha quadrant and beyond may be completely wiped out. Together with the legendary Ambassador Spock, Captain Picard enlists the help of a notorious Romulan war criminal who knows far more than he will reveal about the \\"dead zones\\". With both Klingons and Romulans along for the ride, the Starship Enterprise sets off into enemy territory on a dangerous mission to save the universe.<br />Maximum Warp is the latest in a recent group of excellent two-part Star Trek book series (Avatar, Gemworld, Genesis Wave, etc...) and are without doubt some of the best numbered Star Trek novels I have read so far. The action does not let up for a second - the pace of the book is incredible - and I read it straight through in a couple of hours. Characterization is also pretty good and the action leaps between different settings and story lines - ultimately producing a novel that is so absorbing that you will find it impossible to put down. The quality is maintained throughout part two and although both books could probably have been merged into one larger volume, ultimately Maximum Warp is an enjoyable, exciting and entertaining read.

When the Enterprise receives a distress call from the planet Treva, security chief Tasha Yar and android science officer Data are dispatched to investigate. What the two discover, however, is far more than a simple conflict between the government and a group of rebels. Data must escape from the clutches of the exotic Trevan president Nalavia, while Tasha is forced to confront painful memories when a member of the resistance turns out to be the first man she ever loved, Darryl Adin, a former Starfleet officer convicted of treason and murder six months before they were due to be married. With time running out, Data and Yar must discover the truth in order to save both the planet of Treva from destruction and escaped criminal Dare Adin from life imprisonment in a rehabilitation clinic...<br />Of all the Star Trek books I have read so far, I would rank \\"Survivors\\" as one of the highest. Tasha Yar was my favourite of the Enterprise-D crew up during the first season and I always felt that her death in the episode \\"Skin of Evil\\" was a disappointing end to the one of the strongest female characters seen on Star Trek to date. There were so many aspects of the character that could have been developed or were never explained and this book at least provides some consolation. I'm not completely sure, but as far as I know this is the only novel to focus on Tasha and for that reason alone \\"Survivors\\" is a must-have for all fans of the character. Very little of the remainder of the Enterprise crew is seen: Data and Yar are the principal characters and much of the novel is set in flashbacks to Yar's past. There are a few minor continuity errors of course, no mention is made of Tasha's sister Ishara and her home planet is given a new name - not the author's fault because these facts were revealed long after the book's publication. Overall, this was a fantastic book and I definitely recommend it to all Star Trek fans and especially to those of Tasha Yar.	2001-08-16

It soon emerges that this is not the first attack and that both men and women from all over L.A. are being targeted. The victims seem to have nothing in common, and the description of the attacker differs in every case. Angel has no idea who or what this demon may be.<br />&#8220;Avatar&#8221; was a fast-paced, enjoyable read. John Passarella manages to capture the characters exactly as they are in the TV show and ultimately produces an original, entertaining novel that maintains your interest throughout.  There is no pause in the action and &#8220;Avatar&#8221; is one of the best of the Angel or Buffy books I have read so far. I recommend this book to all Angel fans.	2001-08-12

Now a half-vampire, Darren is forced to abandon his family and friends to travel as an assistant to Mr Crepsley. Already struggling to come to terms with what he has left behind, Darren is now about to face a new dilemma, because animal blood alone is not enough to keep him alive and despite Mr Crepsley's concerns, he refuses to betray the person he used to be by drinking from a human. Returning to the Freak show where his nightmare began, Darren soon strikes up a friendship with Evra, the snake boy and a local kid named Sam. When it seems to Darren that his life is finally taking a turn for the better, tragedy strikes and he is forced to make a choice that will change him forever...<br />After reading \\"Cirque du Freak\\", the first instalment in the saga of Darren Shan, I was hoping that these books weren't just Goosebumps for older readers, and now The Vampire's Assistant has proved to me that they definitely are not. If anything, I enjoyed it even more than the first part of the series. Easy and fun to read, The Vampire's assistant, like its predecessor is one of those books that you read straight through, rush to finish and find out what happens, and then feel sorry when it's over. The main character, Darren is a narrator who is easy to like and identify with as he struggles to come to terms with what he has become. New characters are introduced and are even more vivid and interesting than those revealed in \\"Cirque du Freak\\". This was an enjoyable, action-packed book that is difficult to put down and should appeal to adults and kids alike. Having read #3 Tunnels of blood and #4 Vampire Mountain, I can safely say that this series just keeps on getting better and better. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoyed \\"Cirque du Freak\\" - you won't be disappointed.<br />~Jenna~	2001-08-10

I love happy endings and both these books involve Gaia realising some element of her dreams. Like every instalment in the Fearless saga, Killer is an action-packed, fast-paced read that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. These books are so different to most other teen literature and give a far more realistic outlook on life. I highly recommend this book to all Fearless fans. Although each stands well on its own, it&#8217;s probably best to read the series in order. Having read fairly chaotically (7, 11, 13, 14, 9, 10 and then 12) I know that it is possible to read out of sequence, but the story will make much more sense if you do. This was an excellent addition to the Fearless series.<br />*Jenna Ryan*	2001-08-04

It is 1940 and Europe is in the grip of the Second World War. With Drusilla's eightieth anniversary as a vampire approaching, Spike is determined to grant his lover's greatest wish: to own Freyja's strand, a trinket that will bestow upon the wearer the ability to shape change at will. Their quest leads them to Skrymir's lair, a frozen palace where the ice demon himself presides above a hoard of servants and various creatures of darkness. A deal is made: in return for the necklace, Spike and Drusilla must rid the world of potential slayers before seeking out the Chosen One herself. What ensues is a sequence of gruesome murders as the duo weave their way across Europe, hunting down potential victims and leaving a trail of blood and destruction in their wake. Sixteen-year-old Sophie Carstensen is the slayer, a girl forced to flee her native Denmark with her watcher, Yanna, to evade the Nazi occupation. Arriving at the Council headquarters in London, Sophie is soon despatched to France to combat the vampires seeking easy kills on the battlefield. Her mission soon becomes simple: to locate Spike and Drusilla and to halt their killing spree whatever the cost....<br />&quot;Pretty Maids all in a Row&quot; is a thrilling, darkly humorous novel that successfully combines history, horror and romance to produce a book that surpasses any other in the series. The characterisation of Spike and Drusilla is perfect, the author maintaining their villainous allure while simultaneously presenting them in such a way that readers will find themselves secretly hoping our sadistic anti-heroes will triumph in the end. Initially wary of a novel that did not involve the Slayer herself, I would now name &quot;Pretty Maids&quot; as my absolute favourite of the series. Impossible to put-down, fast-paced, action-packed and always entertaining, this is a book that I would recommend to any fan of the TV programme. The initial humour in the narration of the vampires' actions is to some extent lostupon the way resulting in actions that seem excessively brutal and sadistic in some parts. Not for the faint-hearted, the sex and violence involved make this a novel that is less suitable for a younger audience. Few Buffy fans will fail to be delighted by this dark and thrilling book.<BR>~*Jenna*~	2001-08-04

It is up to Buffy and the others to destroy Shugras spirit forever<br />Prime Evil is an excellent Buffy novel with good characterisation and plenty of action, particularly towards the end. The story took a while to get going and in contrast the last few pages seemed almost rushed.  Crystal Gordon made an interesting villain and a worthy opponent for Buffy. Characters such as Michael and Anya who dont often appear in any of the novels, are given fairly major roles. One of the best things about this book was the mythology included and the flashbacks to ancient times kept it interesting. The descriptions of the primal magic are amazing and give Prime Evil a mystical atmosphere - definitely one of the main highlights of this novel.

Their quest for the truth will eventually lead them to the ruined temples of Mexico and, as always, into danger.<br />The Mystery of the Aztec Warrior is not one of the best of the Hardy Boys books. There is little suspense or plot and I did not feel a great compulsion to keep reading in some parts. The descriptions are good and the characters act as they should but this book lacked originality and did not possess the action and tension of some of the others. Like all the Hardy Boys mysteries, it was fairly enjoyable although I dont think I will be re-reading it any time soon. Of all the spinoff and original series, my favourite would have to be the more recent casefiles series, designed to appeal to older readers and dealing with complex issues and serious crimes. The Aztec Warrior, however, I would only recommend to the avid collectors.	2001-07-30

What results is the boys being drawn into something much deeper: a desperate mission to foil a plot aimed at jeopardizing the space programme. This was a fairly average instalment in the Hardy Boys' series. Iceland makes for an interesting setting and this book was a lot better than the previous one I read, \\"The Mystery of the Aztec Warrior\\". It took a lot less effort to finish and I read it straight through in an hour. There is a fair amount of action although The Arctic Patrol lacks the suspense and intrigue of some of the better books in the series. This was one of the first Hardy Boys' mysteries I ever read, and while it isn't the best, it definitely isn't the worst either.<br />*Jenna Ryan*	2001-07-30

Having recently delivered a passenger to the planet, Crichton and the others decide to take the opportunity to buy supplies, relax, and visit the world's main attraction: The Casino. It isn't long before Rygel takes a chance and ends up losing Moya to the casino owner. Now the Farscape crew are trapped on Liantac with no means of escape and the ever-present threat of Peacekeeper intervention. Forced to work off debts, D'Argo becomes a bodyguard and Zhaan is in danger of being added to a private plant collection. Crichton however has more important issues on his mind, most notably the fact that he can't remember the words to \\"Viva Las Vegas\\".<br />\\"House of Cards\\" is the entertaining first novel in a series based upon the popular television programme, Farscape. Packed with humour and action, this is a must-have for any fan. There isn't much of a plot, but this is so fun to read that you won't really care. The author manages to capture the atmosphere of the show perfectly. The descriptions of Liantac are vivid and the characters behave as you would expect them to. The focus is not placed upon any one member of Moya's crew and everyone is given a chance to shine. \\"House of Cards\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable read. I would recommend it to any fan of the Farscape series.	2001-07-26

Of all the Fearless books I have read up to this point, I would name &#8220;Missing&#8221; as my definite favourite. This series just keeps getting better and better. Gaia has finally made her decision and is now ready to board a plane to Germany with her mysterious Uncle Oliver. Many surprises are in store.... Although not the most exciting or tense, this was by far the most emotional book so far and a different side to Gaia is revealed as we see her finally achieve what she has dreamt of for so long: her father&#8217;s love, and a chance of a home and a family. Back in New York, however, events are taking a turn for the worse. Sam has been accused of his roommate&#8217;s murder and the news that Ed may walk again is somewhat marred by the fact that his relationship with Heather is beginning to break down. This was an excellent addition to the series and I can&#8217;t wait for #15. I recommend this to any Fearless fan.	2001-07-25

Gaia Moore, the girl without the ability to feel fear, is struggling to come to terms with the relationship between her thirty-something foster mother Ella and Sam Moon, the boy Gaia secretly loves. After a fight with Ella results in a shock defeat for the martial-arts expert, Gaia is soon wondering who her seemingly pathetic foster mother really is. With her friend Ed now involved with her worst enemy Heather Gannis, Gaia has no one to turn to but her mysterious `Uncle Oliver'. His offers of freedom and escape are extremely tempting, but are her Uncle's intentions really as innocent as they claim to be?<br />This was a fast-past, action-packed story that was both entertaining and exciting and will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end. I would recommend this book to any fans of the Fearless series. I also appreciated being allowed to glimpse a more naïve side to Gaia. The characters' relationships grow more and more complex with every book and as questions are answered, still more arise. I read #7 - Rebel and wasn't sure I really liked the Fearless books, but after reading Trust I've decided I love them. Gaia is such a complex, fascinating character although I initially dismissed her as cold and not very likeable. I can wait to read the remaining books in the series.	2001-07-24

Set between seasons one and two immediately following Buffy's defeat of The Master, the action divides itself between LA and Sunnydale. Two of the stories feature the vampire slayer herself as she spends the summer with her father and attempts to overcome the events surrounding her `death'. The remaining tales take place back in Sunnydale and feature Giles, Jenny, Angel, Xander and Willow battling the forces of evil, including a plot to revive The Master himself.<br />In \\"Dust\\" by Michelle West, Buffy travels to her father's LA home while struggling with intense visions of the deaths of her friends and family. This was probably the darkest of the six stories and is also a little confusing for the first few pages. \\"Absolom Rising\\" by Nancy Holder deals with a sorcerer's plan to gather the Master's followers with the intent of stealing their leader's bones. Cameron Dokey's \\"Looks could kill\\" is about a shape-shifter who decides to capture Buffy by targeting her friends. \\"No Place Like...\\" is by the same author and once again focuses on Buffy in LA as she attempts to free the trapped spirits of children. For \\"Uncle Dead and the Fourth of July\\" we return to Sunnydale as a group of zombies attempt to take over the town. In the final story, \\"The Show Must Go On...\\" by Paul Ruditis, Giles and the others must save a theatre audience from a vampire crew intent on re-enacting famous death scenes.<br />This is a perfect read for any summer vacation. The stories are lighter in tone and less scary than most existing Buffy novels. Characters such as Jenny Calendar are given a chance to shine in their own right. My only complaint is the lack of Willow and Xander in any of these stories. I hope this won't be the last volume of Buffy and friends' summer vacation stories. I recommend this book to all fans of the series.<br />~Jenna~	2001-07-21

But Michael&#8217;s plan goes terribly wrong when he turns the cuckoo head around. Now time is going backwards and Michael is getting younger every day. Will he be able to reverse the clock&#8217;s effects before time runs out completely?<br />This is one of my favourite books in the goosebumps series. &#8220;The Cuckoo Clock of Doom&#8221; mixes suspense and humour and will keep you reading all the way through. This book also makes me really appreciate being an only child. I recommend this to all kids aged from eight to twelve.<br />~Jenna~	2001-07-08

Blessed, or cursed, with nine lives and the ability to travel to spirit worlds in his dreams, Christopher isn't too thrilled to discover that he is destined to become the next Chrestomanci. Quite content with his dream worlds and performing tasks for his Uncle Ralph, Christopher is horrified when he is made to leave school and friends behind and travel to Chrestomanci Castle. Here he will learn the skills necessary for his future role, a role that Christopher definitely does not want.  Soon the future Chrestomanci is battling a group of smugglers attempting to steal from the dream worlds....<br />\\"The Lives of Christopher Chant\\" is young adult fantasy at its best. The plot is magical and will keep you reading right up until the end. A little slow to get going, the action soon picks up and never stops. Anyone who likes adventure or fantasy should love this.

Of course Buffy doesn't believe it, but this is Sunnydale and legends have a nasty habit of coming true. Soon Giles uncovers the story of a past slayer who encountered the demon Samhain and lost. Now Buffy must face the Lord of Samhuinn and destroy his spirit forever...<br />This was one of the scariest Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels I have read so far.  The characterisation was very good and the plot was suspenseful and absorbing, although it did take a while to get going. The darkness and the rain creates a creepy, tense atmosphere that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. The second half of the book is far superior to the first and the battle between Buffy and Samhain provides a worthwhile climax. Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder have produced what are arguably some of the best Buffy books, and their other works include the Gatekeeper Trilogy, Immortal and Child of the Hunt. I recommend \\"Halloween Rain\\" to all fans of the series. <br />~Jenna~	2001-07-08

Darren Shan lead a perfectly normal life until the day he came across the \\"Cirque du Freak\\" flier that changed his world forever. \\"Cirque du Freak\\", or Circus of Freaks is basically what it sounds like, a freak show with acts such as the wolf-man, the snake-boy and Mr Crepsley and his spider. Determined to view the show, Darren and his friend Steve acquire two tickets and set off to the creepy old theatre in the dead of night. Here they are warned that every act is real and none are harmless. Initially sceptical, Darren and Steve are soon convinced when the wolf-man attacks a member of the audience.<br />But the act that changes both their lives for good is that of Mr Crepsley and his spider, Madame Octa. Fascinated by spiders, Darren is soon captivated by the unusual arachnid, but for Steve it is Crepsley who holds his attention. Recognising his as a famous vampire, Steve waits behind after the show and demands to join him as an assistant. This decision will have terrible consequences for both boys, but ultimately more so for Darren, whose plan to steal Madame Octa goes terribly wrong....<br />\\"Cirque du Freak\\" is the first part in the saga of Darren Shan. Spooky and entertaining, this is a darker, scarier, more complex version of RL Stine's \\"Goosebumps\\" series and is targeted at an older audience. Darren is a likeable narrator with whom readers should be able to identify with. Both adults and teens should enjoy this book as well as younger kids.

I have seen both episodes it is based on - Welcome to the Hellmouth and The Harvest - but that didn't stop me from enjoying it.

When Kit Tyler boarded the Dolphin, a ship that would take her from Barbados to New England, she had no idea what lay in store for her. In the strict puritan community of her relatives, Kit feels alone and out-of-place. Struggling to adapt to life with her Uncle, Aunt and cousins, she is constantly aware of how different she is and finds it difficult to fit in with the ways of the Puritans. Drawn to Blackbird Pond, Kit meets Hannah Tupper, an old woman widely believed to be a witch. Hannah is the only person who understands her, but by associating with her Kit places her own life in danger. In the intensely religious and prejudiced community, Kit is accused of witchcraft and sentenced to stand trial. <br />\\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\" is one of the best Young Adult books ever written.  I have read it so many times I have lost count and yet it still remains, and always will, one of my all-time favourites. It provides a perfect mix of history, romance, drama and suspense and will keep the reader hooked throughout. The characters of Nat and Kit are brilliantly written, as their initial reserve deepens to friendship and finally something more. When reading this book I was torn between wanting it to last forever and desperation to discover how the story would finish. Beautifully written and filled with vivid characters, you want to The Witch of Blackbird Pond to go on and on and never end. This is an amazing, very unique book that I know I will treasure forever.	2001-06-23

When Cade Merrill is contacted by a girl convicted of murder, he is determined to uncover the truth about her crimes. At sixteen Eliza Baynes tried to take her revenge on the stepbrother she hated, but her attempts at a spell ended with the death of her father. Sent to boarding school, Eliza is haunted by her past and the fact that everyone she talks to about what happened dies in mysterious circumstances. <br />Finally convinced she has escaped from the witch's evil, Eliza returns to Burkittsville, where it is soon apparent that history is repeating itself. Eliza was only eighteen years old when she was given the death penalty for killing her then boyfriend Jake Henderson on the evidence of his younger brother Ryan. Her sentence is later retracted and Eliza is sentenced to life imprisonment, but the memories of what took place remain and she needs Cade's help. Eliza claims that she herself is innocent and that Jake's murder was committed by a person under the control of the Blair Witch. As she warns Cade, everyone who hears her story ends up dead. Will Cade be the next victim of the Blair Witch?<br />\\"The Prisoner\\" is the sixth book in the Blair Witch Casefiles series. It was a fast-paced, entertaining and genuinely scary book, although it did lack the suspense of some of the previous books. I love every book in the series so far and this one did not disappoint.

At first the beast's attention seems focussed solely on the slayer when bodies turn up, the deceased all having died in suspicious circumstances. With time running out, Buffy and her friends must figure out the identity of the creature. But why has it come to Sunnydale, and what is the connection with a group of student teachers? <br />Having just read \\"Unnatural Selection\\" by Mel Odom, I was expecting Visitors to be just as good and unfortunately I was disappointed. There just seemed to be something missing from this book. The inclusion of the student teachers seems to serve very little purpose and the synopsis is misleading in suggesting that they are part of the evil that takes place. The characterisation was excellent, but there was little plot and the story just wasn't exciting or scary enough to keep you reading. Overall, this wasn't one of the best Buffy books, but it was still pretty good, although I enjoyed it because of the series and not for the book itself. I would recommend this to all fans of the series.	2001-06-21

David, Christopher, Jalil and April have travelled to an Aztec City with a group of Vikings who are preparing to go to war. Their target: the Aztec God, Huitzilopoctli, whose head is the bargaining tool needed for the return of the Norsemen's own God, Odin. Armed with the legendary hammer of Thor, the Vikings were confident of victory. But when the plan didn't go as expected, Christopher and the others found themselves caught in the centre of a battle to the death...<br />Land of Loss is the second book in KA Applegate's Everworld series and if anything, it's even better then the first. I found Christopher a more likeable narrator than David and his commentary adds plenty of humour to the book. The descriptions of Everworld are so vivid you can actually imagine being there, and the books manage to entertain as well as educate with a mix of history, mythology, fantasy, action and suspense. I find myself liking the characters more and the author really manages to get inside the heads of teenagers. Yes, there's swearing, but it only adds to the realism. I love the Animorphs series, but these books are just so much better, less predictable and more complex.  I recommend this to all fans of the Everworld series.	2001-06-16

After a nightmare that convinces her that something terrible has happened to Thomas, Elizabeth and her friend Margaret journey to Cliff House, the home of the sculptor.

Soon Margaret is ill and Elizabeth begins to uncover the terrible secret of Cliff House. Determined to uncover the truth about her brother, she soon realises that to do this may result in her suffering Thomas's fate....<br />\\"Faces of Terror\\" is the thirteenth book in R.L.Stine's \\"Fear Street Sagas\\". The action was fast paced and actually scary in some parts, even if the plot was fairly typical and sometimes there wasn't enough explanation given. I would recommend it to fans of the series and of the author's other works. This wasn't the best of The Fear Street Sagas, but it was still pretty good.

A place that shouldn't exist, where nightmares are real and creatures of myth and legend roam freely. Now David, April, Jalil and Christopher are trapped between worlds. And they have no idea how to get home...<br />\\"Search For Senna\\" is the first book in KA Applegate's Everworld series. Before I began reading, I had expected something a lot more like Animorphs, but this series is completely different. The characters are older, the plot is darker, more complicated and the book is definitely targeted at a more grown-up audience. Some people complain about the number of swear words in these books: it doesn't bother me. The amount isn't excessive and the language is used realistically and effectively. The books are written for a teenage audience and subsequently contain more adult material.<br />The Everworld books are incredibly imaginative and are an example of some of the best young adult fantasy around. The descriptions are vivid, the action non-stop and the author paints a clear picture of Everworld that draws you in from the first moment. These books are fast-paced and will keep the reader hooked throughout. The characters are well drawn and realistic and even though I don't really find them very likeable at this stage, their personalities may change over the course of the series. After reading this I will definitely be buying the remaining eleven books in the series. I recommend \\"Search for Senna\\" to teens who like fantasy and to the older Animorph fans. <br />~**Jenna**~	2001-06-12

Together with his friend Mina, Michael cares for the strange mixture of bird/man/angel, but his baby sister just doesn't seem to get well. Is it possible that the mysterious Skellig can save her?<br />\\"Skellig\\" is a beautifully written story that is both powerful and sensitive. I have read a huge number of both children and adults' books, but this is one of the ones that stand out. It strays from the usual children's book formula and has an ending that is completely unexpected and unpredictable. The characters are unusual and well described and the author paints a vivid picture of the events that unfold. The book is both entertaining and informative and keeps the reader hooked throughout. I have read both of David Almond's other books, Kit's Wilderness and Heaven Eyes, and would rank this in the middle, with Kit's Wilderness as my far and away favourite.<br />I would recommend this to both children and adults and if you enjoyed this, I would suggest \\"Kit's Wilderness\\" and \\"Heaven Eyes\\", both by the same author.	2001-06-11

When their parents perished in a fire, they thought life couldn't get any worse. They were wrong. When the three children are sent to live with a distant relative, they had hoped their luck was about to change for the better. Unfortunately, they had reckoned without Count Olaf and his diabolically fiendish scheme to steal the children's inheritance.<br />The Series of Unfortunate Events are books that are very different to the typical image of children's literature. As the narrator says, \\"There is no happy ending, there is no happy beginning and there are very few happy things in the middle.\\" The author uses a dark, dry sense of humour and depending on how you focus upon the book, it can either be depressing or very funny. I personally found it very good, but from reading it I can understand why some parents say it gives their kids nightmares. Some of the things that happen to the three orphans are just plain awful.<br />The characters are both entertaining and interesting - Count Olaf is repulsively evil - and the Baudelaires are intelligent, resourceful children who enjoying inventing and reading. No matter what happens, they will always find some solution to their problems, even though more bad things are just around the corner. <br />I recommend this to all kids over the age of 9. Some people call it a JK Rowling wannabe but I disagree. This series is nothing like Harry Potter, nor it as good, but then what children's book could be? I'll definitely be buying more in this wonderfully miserable series.	2001-06-10

However, like everything else in the Shadow World, nothing is as it seems and soon the four are involved in a treasure hunt for three Gold coins that will allow them to rescue Tom and Zach.<br />\\"The Kill\\" is the third and final instalment in the Forbidden Game. Having read all three, I have to say it's also by far the best of the series. The action is non-stop, and the way Julian's character changes is beautifully written. I loved him from the start but especially so in The Kill. Apart from the Shadow Man himself, the other characters are all very realistic, different and likeable. The author did a fantastic job with all three books in the trilogy. There is a perfect mix of fantasy, action and romance in this series and sometimes the books are genuinely scary. The ending was so sad, but so perfect too. Julian still is, and always will be, one of my favourite literary characters. The Forbidden Game trilogy are far superior to most teen books around. This will remain one of my favourite books for a long time yet, despite having read it about fifty times in three years. I would recommend this to any one who read the two previous books in the series.	2001-05-26

After trapping Julian in his own shadow world, Jenny hoped that he would never return. What she didn&#8217;t count on however, was the game being stolen and the two teenage thieves managing to free the Shadow Man. Now Julian is back and this time he&#8217;s angry&#8230;<br />Jenny is offered the chance to play a new game: lambs and monsters. The lambs are Jenny and her friends and they don&#8217;t stand a chance against Julian and his shadow creatures, the creeper and the lurker. One by one, Jenny&#8217;s friends are being captured and transported to the Shadow World. It is up to Jenny to defeat Julian and rescue Tom, Zach and the others. But the shadow man is determined to win and will go to any lengths to claim Jenny as his prize.<br />&#8220;The Chase&#8221; is the second book in the Forbidden Game Trilogy. I absolutely loved #1 &#8220;The Hunter&#8221; and this one was even better. The story mixes romance, action and suspense and the plot is fast-paced and exciting. The character of Julian is one of the best in any book: he manages to be enigmatic, fascinating and compelling at once and he is essentially what makes this book so special. The other characters are realistic, likeable and well drawn, but it is the Shadow Man who stands out. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to all Forbidden Game fans and any one who liked the author&#8217;s other work. To any one who read this and enjoyed it: buy #3 The Hunter, it&#8217;s even better.<br />~Jenna~	2001-05-23

Desperate to find the perfect game for her boyfriend's birthday, Jenny strays into a bad part of town. Followed by tow suspicious men, she escapes into the       mysterious \\"More Games\\" shop. Here she meets Julian, the enigmatic owner with frost white hair and brilliant blue eyes, who persuades her to buy \\"The Game\\". Despite the fact it appears nothing more than a cardboard house, Jenny and her friends decide to put it together, little knowing that it will draw them into the shadow world. Trapped in Julian's realm, Jenny, Tom and the others must confront their worst nightmares as they move through the house. The shadow man has promised that if they reach the top they can go free, but in the shadow world, Julian makes the rules. One of the group will not survive, and will Jenny have to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to let her friends escape?<br />This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I recently picked it up again after first reading it three years ago and could see exactly why I loved it so much. The author combines romance, fantasy and action skilfully and the result is one of the best young adult series I have ever read. The plot is fast paced and suspenseful and will keep you reading right until the end. The characters are likeable, realistic and well drawn and Julian is one of the most compelling, mysterious and fascinating characters I have ever encountered in any book.<br />I've read the Forbidden Game Trilogy so many times I've lost count now. The Hunter is actually my least favourite of the three but each is so good they all deserve five stars easily. If you liked this book, I would recommend the remaining two books in the trilogy, which are just as good if not better.<br />~Jenna~	2001-05-17

When Tamsyn, Josh and Rob come across a sinister e-mail on the internet, they have no idea they will get caught up in a plot to blackmail an international theme park corporation. As they set off for summer vacations around the world, Josh and the others hope the warning is a hoax. But when more e-mails arrive, it seems \\"Icarus\\" is deadly serious. Their worst fears are confirmed when a one of them witnesses an explosion on the famous \\"Meteor\\" ride. With time running out and lives in danger, It is up to the Internet detectives in England, New York, Toronto and Perth to discover the identity of the blackmailer before some one gets hurt.<br />This was the fifth title in the eight book Internet Detective series. These are interesting, fast-paced books that are great for introducing kids to computers. I would recommend \\"System Crash\\" to eight to twelve year olds. If you enjoyed this, I would suggest reading the other Internet Detective books, especially #2 Escape Key, and #7 Virus Attack, which I think to be the best of the ID books.	2001-05-17

It is up to Tamsyn and Rob and their contacts around the world to discover who is making history repeat itself and why.<br />\\"Cyber Feud\\" is the fourth title in the eight book internet detective series. Like the others in the series, it is fast-paced and both entertaining and interesting. Although this wasn't one of my favourite I.D. books, it is still fully deserves four stars and is brilliant for encouraging children to use the internet. I would recommend it to eight to twelve year olds.<br />If you enjoyed this, I would suggest reading the other Internet Detective books, especially #2 Escape Key, and #7 Virus Attack, which I think to be the best of the ID books.	2001-05-16

Willow isn't too happy with her new baby-sitting job. The strange noises she hears in the house are starting to scare her, but nothing could prepare her for being attacked by a creature that has taken the place of baby Tad. Only just managing to get away, Willow can't stop thinking about what happened and is haunted by images of the missing child. At the same time, Buffy has her hands full with the vampires of Sunnydale.  When she and Giles discover some ancient artefacts at an archaeological site, it seems they may some how be connected to the missing children. But what is behind the disappearances and why will no one do anything about it?<br /> \\"Unnatural Selection\\" is a great addition to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Series, although you don't have to be a fan of the TV programme to enjoy this book. This is probably one of the best young adult Buffy books around. The author manages to write convincingly about the characters and they all act as you expect them to. The plot was fast paced, enjoyable and kept me reading right up to the end. I recommend this book to fans of the series and any one who likes a mix of horror and fantasy.	2001-05-16

Gaia Moore is seventeen and, as the title would suggest, is unable to feel fear. When Gaia, Mary and Ed decide to play truth and dare, Gaia shows the lengths she will go to not to reveal the truth. Attempting to make her divulge something about her past, Mary and Ed invent increasingly dangerous dares but soon discover that Gaia will do anything they suggest. Things get worse when Mary is contacted by her ex-dealer. She owes him five hundred dollars and he's given her twenty-four hours to pay up...<br />One good thing about this book is how different it is to most of the other teen books around. This was the first Fearless title I've read so far, so I can't tell you how it compares to the others, but the characters are realistic and the book is action-packed and fast paced. I'm not sure I'll be reading any future titles in the series - to be honest, I just don't like the characters very much, although that may be due to the fact that I haven't read any of the previous books. Still, this wasn't bad and I read it through in a couple of hours. Overall, four stars and I recommend it to all fans of the Fearless series.	2001-05-13

The arrival of his cousin Alex has put an end to his plans for a camping trip and a date with Pauline, a girl he likes. Even so, Brodie is determined to make an effort to be nice, which is why he decides to teach Alex to swim.<br />In a sheltered pond that lies beside the awesome Blackwater River, Brodie and Alex come across Pauline and another boy, Otis. Angry and hurt, Brodie decides to play a practical joke on them - a joke that goes disastrously wrong. <br />When Pauline and Otis are swept away by the formidable Blackwater currents, Brodie is torn between telling the truth and his fear of the consequences if he does. His attempts to rescue the two kids have made him a local hero and Brodie is sure that only he and Alex know the truth. However, it soon appears that there was another witness to the crime when Brodie receives a note on which is written simply the word \\"Tell\\".<br />\\"Blackwater\\" is a book that is full of suspense and will keep you reading right until the end. This was a compelling, absorbing read that shows the consequences of lying to cover the truth. The plot races along at the same rate as the Blackwater River itself and the characters are well drawn and believable. \\"Blackwater\\" shows how one boy's life was changed forever by a seemingly harmless prank and how a guilty conscience can be worse than the truth itself.	2001-05-12

Following their escape from the Fairy Land and possible incineration by the Nidhoggr dragon, Christopher, David, Jalil and April find themselves in Hetwan country. Here they encounter Dionysus and Ganymede, two gods who have been condemned to death by Ka Anor. In a forest surrounded by Hetwan, their only choice is to help the gods escape and join them on their journey to Olympus. But first they must pass through the city of Ka Anor.<br />This was the second Everworld book I have read so far. The story is fast paced and keeps you reading right until the end. The descriptions are amazing and Christopher's narration adds plenty of humour. I think that overall I preferred my previous one, #8 Brave the Betrayal, because the descriptions of Africa were so vivid. I thought Fear the Fantastic stood on its own less well and was harder to read if you knew little of the story background and character history. The fact that the plot can be quite hard to understand when you haven't read the earlier books in the series is my only fault with this. Apart from that, this is young adult fantasy at its best. I would recommend &quot;Fear the Fantastic&quot; to all fans of KA Applegate and will definitely by buying more titles in this series.	2001-05-09

Following the death of her mother shortly after Adeline's birth, the little girl is looked upon as bad luck and made to feel unwanted. In a story that sometimes parallels that of the real Cinderella, Adeline is neglected and mistreated, ignored by her father and hated by her stepmother. The only affection shown to Adeline is that given by her aunt and grandfather. Her success at school becomes a way of seeking attention and approval from her father, a fact sometimes resented by her siblings. When she unintentionally disobeys an order never to bring her friends home, her parents have her sent away to a boarding school in Tianjin. Throughout her school career, Adeline's dream is to follow her brothers to university in England, but it is only when she wins an international play-writing contest that her father finally accepts her as his daughter and grants her wish. <br />Chinese Cinderella is a touching and compelling story of a child's fight to be accepted by those around her. Throughout the book, Adeline remains positive and hopeful for the future and the author manages to gain the reader's sympathy without indulging in self-pity. From a historical point, this novel is fascinating, as it tells of life for a young girl in China around the time of the Second World War. The author also provides information on Chinese culture, tradition and history, as well as a translation of the real Cinderella story. The book was fantastic and I managed to read it straight through with out stopping. The tale of a young girl's strength in the face of such cruelty and neglect is truly inspiring and teaches you to value the love that you might otherwise take for granted. I have also read \\"Falling Leaves\\", a version of this book that is targeted at adults, and would give that a five-star rating also. I would recommend Chinese Cinderella to all young adults and for and any child who knows what it is like to feel alone in the world. <br />~Jenna S. Ryan~	2001-05-04

In a desperate attempt to restore his family's fortune, Artemis comes up with a plan to steal gold from the fairies. Along with his trusty butler sidekick \\"Butler\\", he travels to Vietnam on a quest to find a volume of fairy commandments. Once this is achieved and the book deciphered, the next logical step would be to kidnap a fairy and wait for the ransom money to arrive. However, when Artemis kidnaps Captain Holly Short of the LEPrecon, it seems he's made a mistake. Because these aren't the cute little elves of bedtime stories. These fairies are armed, dangerous and ready to fight. And they will stop at nothing to get Holly back.<br />The book has often been claimed to be the \\"next Harry Potter\\", but while it shares the same fantastically imaginative storyline and colourful descriptions, this is far darker and more humorous than JK Rowling's books. The main characters are all unique and loveable, particularly Holly, Foaly and Root. Even the anti-hero, Artemis Fowl himself is strangely appealing, despite his more dubious characteristics. As the book goes on, you begin to see that he does indeed possess a conscience, he is just careful never to let it get in the way of his evil schemes.<br />Artemis Fowl is full of humour and action. The author has produced an imaginative, fast-paced adventure, which combines magic and technology. The style of narrative is fairly informal, making it easier and more enjoyable to read. Although the first chapter is quite slow, the action soon speeds up and never stops. The story was absorbing, exciting and I read it straight through in a couple of hours without stopping. Where the \\"Goblet of Fire\\" was quite frightening, Artemis Fowl is full of humour and the typical fairy magic is replaced with action and wit.<br />I think that this book would be less appealing to younger children in the way that Harry Potter managed to be, but older kids, teenagers and adults alike should enjoy the mix of fantasy, humour and adventure. Overall: five stars, and I will definitely be reading it again. This is no copy of Harry Potter; Artemis Fowl is a completely original work but is still deserving of all the hype. I am sure I will be buying any future books in the series.	2001-04-30

Isabel knows how important it is for Michael, Max and her to be careful with their alien powers. Sheriff Valenti and the other members of Project Clean Slate are always on the lookout for anything suspicious and the three aliens and their friends are in danger of being discovered. But Isabel has always felt as if she has been dragged down with all their worries and cautions. Then Nikolas arrives, and finally she meets some one who understands her. That fact that Nikolas is also an alien who is not afraid to use his powers only serves to draw Isabel to him even more. Nikolas accepts Isabel as she is and being around him makes her feel as if she were flying. However Max and the others don't share her views - they think Nikolas is trouble. After an incident involving Isabel and Nikolas that leads to Sheriff Valenti becoming suspicious confirms their fears, Isabel's friends attempt to make her see sense. But will Isabel realise the truth before the members of Project Clean Slate discover their secret? <br />I thought this book was pretty good. It's the first I've read so far in this series so I can't tell you how it compares to the other books. There was some interesting character development, plenty of action and it was well written. The scenes between Michael and Maria are especially good as we see their friendship begin to deepen. The only fault I found was the informal way in which parts of the book are written, but this is only a minor point and I only mention it because it irritated me a little. Overall, I give this book four stars and recommend it to all Roswell High fans.	2001-04-23

In the summer of 1974, sixteen-year-old Sharon Webster is sent away to camp at Deep Creek Lake in Western Maryland. Here she meets Gavin Burns, a boy who wears a \\"Plague\\" T-shirt in honour of his favourite band, and is obsessed with the occult, tarot cards and everything to do with the Blair Witch. Gavin is infatuated with Sharon and sets about trying to prove the Witch's existence to impress her. The plot goes tragically wrong and results in Sharon witnessing the horrifying death of Gavin in the swamps near to Deep Creek Lake.<br />Now forty two years old, and with a sixteen year old daughter of her own, Sharon has done her best to forget that the events at Deep Creek Lake ever happened. But for her daughter, Kayla, it isn't so easy. Her mother has never spoken of the events that went on, yet Kayla finds herself dreaming of a boy in a \\"Plague\\" T-shirt holding a Tarot Card to symbolise death. He tells her his name is Gavin and begs for help as she watches him drown in the swamp. Kayla is frightened by these dreams but her mother refuses to tell her what happened. Together with her cousin Erin and boyfriend Jon, Kayla resolves to seek the truth about the secret her mother is keeping from her. As in the Blair Witch Project movie itself, the three venture into the forest, armed with a video camera and determined to find answers. But is history about to repeat itself, and who will be the next victim of the Blair Witch?<br />This is the scariest book in the Blair Witch Files so far. The action is fast-paced and will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. This book was more about being scary than having an interesting or complicated plot. I really recommend \\"The Death Card\\" and the remaining books in this series to all teen readers and horror fans.	2001-04-22

While driving one night he gets lost and ends up in a town called `Blair'. Frank immediately decides that there is something strange about this town - there are no lights, very few buildings and he can hear a young child crying in the woods. He assumes it is a ghost town until a pale young woman appears. Despite the fact she is obviously human, she ignores him and Frank realises that she is sleepwalking. Soon, other people emerge from the woods, all of whom are walking in their sleep. Frank attempts to communicate with the woman, but just as she `wakes', an old man charges toward them wielding an axe. Abruptly, the inhabitants of the town disappear.<br />The next day at school, Frank is amazed to recognise some of the people he saw in Blair the previous night. However, no one he speaks to seems to have any recollection of the events that took place, with the exception of Lillith, a purple haired girl who bears a striking resemblance to the woman Frank saw in Blair. She appears terrified of Frank and gives him the cryptic message \\"You're going to die. And there's nothing anyone can do to save you.\\" As a boy is found dead, Frank and Lillith must work together to discover the truth. Why are these people drawn to Blair, and what is the connection between the woman in Lillith's dream and the Blair Witch herself?<br />\\"Blood Nightmare\\" is the fourth book in the Blair Witch Files series and probably my favourite so far. I have read and enjoyed the previous three books and this one was as good, if not better, as the dream world made it more interesting. The Blair Witch Files are more fun to read than the Point Horror books I have read, and a lot scarier as well! I would recommend it to all teenage horror fans as both creepy and entertaining.	2001-04-22

Brett Lawless and Clare Tilley are the most successful detective partnership in the South Yorkshire police force despite the differences in the way they go about solving crimes. Brett is a chemistry graduate, cool, calm and logical, whereas Clare is far more of a `people person', sceptical of evidence gathered by scientific means.<br />Their third case is a high-profile murder investigation. \\"You will be getting to know me\\" is the cryptic message left at a murder scene, and sure enough the bodies soon begin piling up, each accompanied by a similarly sinister note. Worse still, the murderer has developed a grudge against Brett himself and begins murdering simply to taunt him. Lawless and Tilley know time is running out, yet some how the serial killer manages to stay one step ahead of them. They know the answer is staring them in the face, but like a magic eye puzzle, it is impossible to see. Soon the detectives realize that this killer is dangerously intelligent: he knows the traits the police are looking for in his victims, gender, skin colour, age, etc and manages to disprove each theory as soon as it is constructed. But how does he manage this, and what are the reasons behind his crimes?<br />Lawless and Tilley #3: Magic Eye is probably the best of all seven books. The story is fast paced and will have you on the edge of your seat throughout and the ending is totally unpredictable and keeps you guessing until the last minute. There is also some good character development, as Brett's history is filled in, and he and Clare begin to get closer. Overall, this is one of the best young adult detective novels I've ever read and I would recommend it to any teenage readers and crime novel fans.	2001-04-21

Literally. <br />After a meeting with the Goddess Athena, the five main characters are sent on a mission to Egypt to find Senna's mother. The Coo-Hatch have used the information from April's chemistry book to make gunpowder and this could become a deadly weapon that they will use against Olympus unless they are sent home to their universe. However, the only person who can do this is Senna's mother who is thought to be in Egypt. To find her and avert catastrophe, Jalil and the others must cross the perilous African continent.<br />During the journey, they encounter Eshu, a mysterious being who demands that a sacrifice is made to please the African Gods. Despite Senna's pleading, the other characters refuse either due to general principals or religious beliefs, and Eshu responds by sending them into the mirror world where the grass is blue, the water purple and everything is upside-down...  <br />This book was amazing. The descriptions of Everworld are amazingly vivid and colourful and you can really imagine actually being there. I love mythology so I found the information on the Ancient Gods and cultures interesting. I expected something a lot more like Animorphs and this is completely different. The plot and characters are far more complex, in keeping with the older target audience, and although I love animorphs, I have to say that this is far superior. My only fault with the book is that not much history or character information is given and the events can become very confusing at times. Overall, five stars and I can't wait to read the remaining books in the series.	2001-04-21

Eileen Treacle was only ten years old when she drowned in `East Tappy Creek\\" and several witnesses testified that they saw a `bony white hand' reach out of the water to pull the girl in.<br />When Cade posts a message on his website asking for information on the legend, he doesn't expect success. After wading through dozens of replies, he comes across an e-mail from Cecelia Northrupp, a girl who claims to have seen the ghost of Eileen Treacle. Without hesistation, Cade decides to check her story out and uncovers the story of three more mysterious deaths near the same creek.<br />The story is narrated by Cecelia Northrup herself and involves a high school camping trip that takes place 174 years after the strange death of Eileen Treacle. Immediately, things start to go wrong: the weather is freezing, some of the kids become ill, and ghost of a little girl appears to one of the seventh graders.  Cecelia is convinced that something is wrong and the behaviour of one of the teachers and her boyfriend Mark is soon putting everyone's life in danger. But what is causing these strange events to occur and how are they linked to the creek itself?<br />This book was fast-paced, entertaining and fairly creepy. I think it was less `psychological' than the previous book in this series, \\"The Dark Room\\", but equally enjoyable. I have to say I like the way that nothing is ever proved in these books and that the reader is left to make up their own mind about the unexplained events that take place. Overall, five stars and I recommend it to any teen who likes horror stories.	2001-04-21

However, Cade finds himself drawn to her, and soon he has invited her to Burkittsville. At first, Laura comes across as enthusiastic, intense and determined, but Cade quickly discovers that lurking behind his initial impressions, there is something wrong with Laura. A trip to the ruined house of a serial killer causes her to experience strange visions of the owner's childhood. The photographs she takes prove to Cade that she is telling the truth, but Laura's behaviour rapidly becomes more erratic and out-of-control. As her visions reveal more about the dark secrets in the past of murderer Rustin Parr, Cade must discover the link between Laura and the serial killer before tragedy strikes again.<br />The fact that I haven't seen the movie itself didn't stop me from enjoying this book. The story is faced-paced and suspenseful. I recommend it as a great horror story for teens, but it probably wouldn't be suitable for any kids under twelve years old. ....	2001-04-20

When the animorphs discover that the Yeerks plan to make a presidential candidate into a controller during his stay in hospital, they know they have to act fast. The idea they come up with is to infiltrate the hospital and find some way of halting the plan. However, during the resulting battle, Jake is knocked unconscious and is infested by a yeerk. The other animorphs soon realise something is wrong and attempt to prevent the yeerk from revealing their identities to Visser Three. The only way to do this is to keep Jake captive for three days until the Yeerk is starved of the `Kandrona Rays' it needs to survive. During this time, Ax must pose as Jake while he himself struggles against the Yeerk's dominance and the fact that its previous host was Jake's brother Tom...<br />After reading forty or so animorph books, I have to say I still rate 'The Capture' among my top three. It is interesting, enjoyable and original and the plot moves along at a fast pace. The good thing about this series is that it is both entertaining and informative and teaches the reader a lot about animals. I still believe that the earlier books in the Animorphs series are of a higher standard, and `The Capture' just proves my point. This book should appeal to all nine to twelve year olds and I recommend all the Animorphs books, particularly #4, \\"The Message\\" and #13 \\"The Change\\".	2001-04-18

Animorphs #5, 'The Predator' just supports my belief that the earlier books in the series are the best. Marco, Cassie, Jake, Rachel and Tobias attempt to assist new recruit Ax to return to the Andalite home world by stealing a Yeerk Bug Fighter. But Marco still isn't sure that having the power to morph is such a good thing. He and his friends keep finding themselves in more and more danger, and Marco decides he's had enough. After the death of his mother affected his Dad so badly, Marco is scared by the thought of leaving him alone. With this in mind, he comes to the decision that this will be his last mission. No more danger, no more Animorphs. But then he discovers a secret that is going to change his mind. And this secret is going to give him real cause to continue the fight...<br />This book is just another example of why I think the earliest Animorph novels are the best. OK, there are some exceptions, but generally the standard is far better because the books stand on their own with a greater degree of success. Not quite of the five star standard, `The Predator' comes very close. The introduction of Ax the Andalite brings humour to the book as he struggles with the concepts of taste and speech and the scenes in space are well described. If you enjoyed this book, I would recommend Animorphs #6, \\"The Capture\\", which is one of the best Animorph books there is.	2001-04-18
US	49725342	R1DUCLT08Z8F4M	0440414806	159975375	Holes	Books	5	6	9	N	N	A wonderful book for young adults	After being falsely accused of stealing a pair of trainers, Stanley Yelnats is sentenced to spending eighteen months at `Camp Green Lake', a juvenile detention facility. Thinking this was a better option than jail, he waves goodbye to his parents and sets off. Immediatly it seems he has made a mistake. In the hot, dry surroundings of what used to be the largest lake in Texas, the prisoners are made to dig a hole, five feet square and deep, every day, the idea behind this unconventional treatment is that \\"If you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy.\\"<br />Blaming his misfortune on his &quot;no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather&quot;, Stanley is soon under the watchful eyes of the authoritarian Mr Sir and the creepy warden, whose main hobby is painting her nails with snake venom. Soon Stanley is losing weight, gaining self-esteem and making friends. However all is not as it seems at Camp Green Lake, and instead of digging to improve his character, Stanley must dig for the truth....<br />At first glance, the book appears to be a good-versus evil tale, with Stanley fighting to clear his name and escape from Camp Green Lake. However, the book is far deeper and includes events from the past, such as how the curse on the Yelnats family came about and the story of Kate Barlow. Past and present become linked after Stanley discovers treasure in the sand and escapes from Camp Green Lake with his friend Zero.<br />Holes is an unusual book, but is all the better for it. The plot is pretty complicated, yet the chapters are short enough to hold your attention. Characters such as Stanley, Zero and X-Ray are realistic and teenagers should find them easy to relate to. The story jumps between several different time periods, and this can become quite confusing, but overall the story is fast-paced, absorbing and interesting. One of the most fascinating young adult novels I've read in a long time.	2001-04-11

We've no idea where we are going. But while we're here in the world, if we're brave enough, we'll flap our wings and fly&quot;.<br />Erin, January and Mouse are damaged children. Having lost their parents, the three are cared for in an orphanage, Whitegates, where they lack the warmth and love they crave. After deciding to run away, the children sail down the river on a makeshift raft, only to run aground on the swamp-like \\"Black Middens\\". As they crawl from the mud, they encounter Heaven Eyes, a girl with webs between her fingers and the ability to see through the darkness of the world to the heaven beneath. <br />Heaven Eyes immediately assumes the three children are her long lost sister and brothers and pleads with them to stay. Together with her only companion, an old man known simply as `Grampa', Heaven Eyes lives in an abandoned factory beside the river. The girl's innocence and beauty intrigues the three children, particularly Erin, who comes to be Heaven's \\"bestest friend\\". As the story progresses, the mysterious past of Heaven Eyes is revealed and dreams and reality mix.<br />\\"Heaven Eyes\\" is David Almond's third novel for children. The reader is skilfully drawn into dark, dream-like places before finally being lead out into the light. As in his two previous works, \\"Skellig\\" and \\"Kit's Wilderness\\", the plot is magical, a mix of fantasy and reality that won't fail to enchant. Whereas the previous two books are set in the air and underground respectively, Heaven Eyes revolves around and in water. The story flows in a way that reflects the river it is set around and the lack of realism in regards to the story and characters only adds to the mystical air of the book. Although I prefer his other two works, Heaven Eyes is a unique, unusual and special book.<br />The only problem I have with this book is the lack of realism in the portrayal of the characters, in regards to their speech, actions and behaviour, which is not in keeping with their age. A minor point is that the way Heaven Eyes talks can become irritating, but these things can be overlooked in favour of the books positive points.<br />If you enjoyed \\"Heaven Eyes\\", I would recommend Skellig and Kit's Wilderness, both by the same author, and the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy by Philip Pullman.	2001-04-11

After reading this several years ago, I became interested in the internet and went on to purchase the remaining seven ID books.<br />What Happens? This books main purpose is to set the scene for further books, introduce and connect the characters, etc. Josh and Tamsyn are pupils at the Abbey School with different views on the internet. When Tamsyn begins receiving e-mails from the mysterious Z-Master, it is the beginning of what will become a desperate race against time to discover his identity. With the help of kids in New York, Perth and Toronto, Tamsyn and Josh attempt to decipher a cryptic e-mail that will lead them to a boy in danger...<br />\\"Net Bandits\\" is an action-packed fast-paced adventure and great for the purpose of introducing and encouraging children to use the Internet. I would recommend it to children aged from about eight to twelve.<br />If you enjoyed this, I would suggest reading the other Internet Detective books, especially #2 Escape Key, and #7 Virus Attack, which I think to be the best of the ID books.	2001-04-07
US	49725342	R32RC2DA1NDWMV	044041329X	344802885	Step by Wicked Step	Books	5	1	1	N	N	An absorbing read	Read and Weep, says the spidery writing on the cover of the book. Read and Weep. When five children become stranded in the haunted towers of Old Harwick Hall, they uncover the story of Richard Clayton Harwick, a boy who knew what it meant to have a truly wicked stepfather. As the lightning flashes, the children begin to relate their own tales of step parents, stories that are full of warmth and humour, yet with a fair share of sadness.<br />At first it seems the children could have nothing in common. Sports-mad Robbo, quick-witted Ralph, sensible Claudia, fiery Pixie and dreamy Colin seem as different to each other as it is possible to be. Yet they soon find they have one thing in common, and that is that they are all the products of broken homes. <br />Having read several of Anne Fine's books, I would have to say I think this is the best. The lack of plot is of no consequence as the books main purpose is as a forum for the various stories. \\"Step By Wicked Step\\" proves that all pain eventually heals and that we have the power to change things for the better.  <br />I found I could relate to the children, as although I have never had to cope with a stepfamily, my mother is a single parent. Colin's story I found especially moving, having never known my father.<br />I first read this book when I was nine years old, and still enjoy it even today. A combination of interesting characters, moving stories and the powerful, disturbing tale of Richard Clayton Harwick combine to make this an immensely enjoyable read. <br />\\"Step by Wicked Step\\" is a tale that is both funny and moving. It is the perfect read for any children whose parents have separated, or any child who has to cope with a step-parent or step-family. Even for those who aren't in that situation, the book is an absorbing read that will make you both laugh and cry. <br />If you enjoyed \\"Step by wicked Step\\", I would recommend \\"The Tulip Touch\\" by the same author, which is a powerful, disturbing read.	2001-04-06

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the most eagerly awaited book in history, by both children and adults alike, and it did not disappoint. Like the previous three, from the start it had me hooked, and I  finished it the day I got it. The Goblet of Fire is far longer than the  other books, being twice the size of The Prisoner of Azkaban, which is  great because it allows for a more complex plot and greater detail.<br />It  follows the trend set by `Azkaban' in being slightly darker than the  previous two, and we see less of that fairy tale magic, although there is  still enough there to make this book as enchanting as the others.<br />I think  of all the Harry Potter books, this is my favourite so far. Being slightly  older than the target reading audience (10/11 year olds), I preferred the  darker side to the plot and the amount of suspense and the way the author  manages to have you fearing for Harry's life. It is also good to see Harry,  Ron and Hermione beginning to grow up, and we see the three go on their  first dates.<br />Unfortunately, apart from the World Cup match between  Ireland and Bulgaria at the start of the book, there are no Quidditch  matches between the four houses. The annual Quidditch cup is replaced by a  triwizard tournament, where Hogwarts competes with two other wizarding  schools, which fills a large part of the book and adds some exciting twists  and turns to the book.<br />All the usual characters are involved, as well as  some new ones including Rita Skeeter, a reporter for the Daily Prophet who  plagues Harry throughout the book, and Mad-Eye Moody, the latest in a long  line of Defence against the Dark Arts teachers.<br />As usual, JK Rowling  writes a magnificent story with a complicated plot, some how managing to  weave all the tiny details together. The book has a spectacular finish,  perhaps her best yet, and leaves several un-answered questions ready for  book 5. The book gives the impression of being a turning point in the  series, and several big events happen which seem certain to have a big  impact on the remaining books. In books one and two, we were introduced to  the characters, and book three a lot of the background was filled in. In  book 4 the action really begins, and rather than being a complete story the  way the other three were, this seems to serve as the beginning to a much  bigger story, one that will continue through all the books in the  series.<br />Like all the others, Goblet of Fire manages to successfully blend  humour, supense and mystery, and keeps the reader guessing to the end.  Not  many children between the ages of 7 and 12 could fail to be impressed by  this, and the Harry Potter books are rare in the way that they manage to  enchant both adults and children alike. In short: this book is fantastic;  my favourite of the series so far, but whether it will stay that way  depends on book 5.<br />This book was brilliant and I can't wait to read what  happens next! :)point in the  series, and several big events happen which seem certain to have a big  impact on the remaining books.

Be warned though, if you hate Klingons, don't buy this;  Vengeance is full of `em.<br />The story has Worf's loyalties questioned when  a group of Klingons including some of his friends attempt to take over the  Deep Space Nine space station while Captain Sisko and most of the crew are  away. <br />One of my favourite parts of the book is O'Brien's speech about Dr  Bashir, who he thinks is dead. This author manages to incorporate humour  into otherwise serious or dull situations, which is one of the reasons I  like his books so much. <br />The book was mostly fast paced, although like  some of the other reviewers, I agree it did drag in some places.<br />I liked  the way the author goes into the relationships between the crewmembers,  especially Odo and Quark, and Doctor Bashir and Chief O'Brien. Mr Ab Hugh  is particularly great at writing for Deep Space Nine, although anything he  writes for Star Trek is good.<br />As I said before, this book will appeal to  most Klingon fans, in particular fans of Worf and DS9 fans in general. I  give it three and a half stars - not quite four-star material but too good  for three - because even though I'm not the Klingons' greatest fan, this  was still a good, enjoyable piece of Sci-fi.<br />If you like Vengeance, go  and buy Fallen Heroes. If you don't like Vengeance ... still buy Fallen  Heroes. Then you'll see this author at his best.	2000-06-02

The description of Gemworld is so vivid and colourful and I could almost imagine being there. John Vornholt is one of the better Star Trek authors and creates a realistic portrait of each character and how he or she would act, making the story believable. <br />Another good thing  about this book is Barclay, who I have always enjoyed watching and reading  about. To me, he has always been a destinctive and well portrayed  character, and despite only appearing a few times, he has always been a  very memorable part of the show. His relationship with the Elaysian Melora  Pazlar was done brilliantly, not over done, yet still playing an important  part in the story. Vornholt manages all the relationships between the  characters well, not just Pazlar and Barclay. This is a great book if you  like to read about the characters interacting.<br />The story is also good,  with an original concept. Although another of those 'Save a planet' books,  this one stands alone as a little different. The descriptions of the planet  are beautiful, and the inhabitants are wonderfully varied and different.  The Elaysian's and the other species are well portrayed and the diffent way  they react to humans and the threat to their planet keep the book  interesting. The book was a little slow to start with, but once I got into  it I couldn't put it down, and the mystery of who was destroying Gemworld  kept me reading, and also made my go out and buy the second book.<br />The  plot is good, even if it is a little complicated, and you may find yourself  getting a little confused halfway through. I was very impressed with the  descriptiveness and imagination put into this book and would recommend it,  and also its sequel, Gemworld book 2, which continues the story.<br />Overall,  I think this is a great book, and while it's not my favourite Star Trek  book, it's still one of the better ones.	2000-04-29

This is a good, solid Star Trek story, but it isn't brilliant, nor is it original. This book is just another Enterprise-saves-the-planet affair, only this time (wait for it...) the  planet gets sent through a wormhole. That's right.<br />If this were possible,  wouldn't it be mentioned before in Star Trek? As it is Data's  'revolutionary scientific experiment' seems a little farfetched and  ridiculous. It does manage to keep your interest though, and it didn't take  me too long to read. I think the best bits were the part where that piece  of the planet breaks off and the actual crossing through the wormhole.<br />I  will admit that once I managed to forget about the absurdity of the whole  wormhole thing, I did enjoy this book, although I still think there are a  lot of better save-a-planet books (Death of the Princes, Last Stand, Double  Helix #1...)<br />I think people who like that kind of pioneering/scientific  Star Trek book will probably go for this. I give it 'average' - three  stars.	2000-04-16

I have read nearly all of the TNG books, and I have to say: this is without doubt one of the worst.<br />There were some good things about the book (not many but some), one of which was the descriptions of Ne'elat,  which I found to be quite vivid, and the other is the front cover, which  has a nice use of gold lettering and colour, although I'm not sure this  should be considered when buying the book. Other than that though ...<br />As  far as bad points go, there is practically no insight into the characters  of the crew or the aliens. I will go as far to admit that I admired the  author's style of writing, and it would have been a good book if it hadn't  been so MIND-NUMBINGLY BORING!<br />I could tell from the start that this was  not going to be one of TNG's best offerings, and unfortunately I was proved  right. There was no plot to speak of, way too much speaking, and as I said  before, no character information.<br />In my opinion: don't waste your money.  Buy 'Imzadi' or 'Q in Law'.	2000-04-15

It was the first Deep Space Nine novel I ever read and convinced me to buy more. The interaction between Quark and Odo as they try to save the station is both clever and hilarious, and brought comedy to  a book that is otherwise rather morbid and frightening in tone.<br />I really  liked the style of writing the author uses, and the way he skips back and  forth between past and future, allowing us to see the results of the  invasion, as well as how they came about.<br />Another good thing about the  book is that it does not focus on one particular character, and, although  Quark and Odo are at the centre of the story, each individual character has  at least one big moment in which to shine.<br />The portrail of the enemies  was brilliant, making them actually seem frightening, instead of cliched  and ridiculous, and the writer brings a lot of dramatic tension to the book  as the heroes are killed off one by one. <br />I recommend this book to all  Star Trek fans, especially fans of Odo and Quark. Even people who have  never seen an episode of Star Trek will enjoy this book. In my opinion it  is one of the best DS9 novels, if not of any of the Star Trek series. My  advice is: BUY THIS BOOK!	2000-04-15

I liked this book, even though it tended to be a little over dramatic, and many of the crew's actions did not seem to fit their characters, although to be fair to the author, this book was written at the very start of TNG's  run, and the characters have developed a lot since then. <br />The passage at  the very start of the book was well written, and there was some good scenes  between the characters, but I found the book just a little too slow. I have  read some of Diane Carey's other ST books, and while she's not my favourite  Trek author, I do enjoy most of her books, especially 'Ship of the Line'.  <br />I think the book would be better if more time was spent on developing a  more complicated storyline, and less time on the characters feelings on the  'Ghost Ship'. Maybe it's just me, but the plot seemed too basic, and  centred completely on what to do about the life draining entity. As it was,  the book was more a question of ethics than a Star Trek novel.<br />A good,  thought-provoking Star Trek novel, but not one of the best.	2000-04-15

The two stories were well told and balanced each other well. I especially like the element of mystery that was added to each story, which kept me hooked and I couldn't put the book down. I like the  way this book keeps you guessing right until the end. <br />Of the two  stories, I think the plague scenario was the better, and although I liked  the 'Iomides' one, I found it a little too predictable. However, I found  that both stories were done realistically, and you could almost see Picard  and Riker trying to cope with their seperate missions. <br />I would recommend  this book to all other Trekkies, and anyone else who likes that kind of  story. A really good book.	2000-04-11

If you like that kind of technical/ factual Star Trek then this book won't disappoint. It has a really good concept - did the Borg really create the Dyson Sphere? - and is well written. But any one who likes lots of action  and excitement in their ST books, then my advice is: do not buy this book!<br />Maybe its just me, but I thought this book had too much scientific stuff  and too little going on. The characters were the only thing going for a  book that was way too short (it had less than 200 pages!). The book had two  very talented writers but still reads like it was written in a rush to  finish before a deadline.<br />If you read it you'll probably end up really  confused, as half of the crew's decisions don't seem to make any sense at  all. It's the kind of book that gets read once and then never again.<br />I  give it two stars - one for being a Star Trek book and the other for good  descriptive/factual writing.	2000-04-09
