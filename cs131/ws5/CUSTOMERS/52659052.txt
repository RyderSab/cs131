It's even rarer to find one that puts the stories in a meaningful context.  I would put this book on the shelf next to Robert Graves' Greek Myths and Kevin Crossley-Holland's Norse Myths as among the few really successful attempts to capture the essence of a mythological tradition.<br />But while Graves and Crossley-Holland were writing about the myths of one culture with one language, Bierhorst is looking at the stories of an entire continent that encompasses dozens of different peoples.  He manages this nearly impossible task by grouping the many tribes of North America into eleven different geographical categories, and outlining the major mythological themes of each region--but without ever forgetting that each tribe has its own distinct identity and vision of the world.<br />This book seems to be marketed as a book for young adults, which puzzles me a bit.  While a high school or even a bright junior high student could read and enjoy this book, there's nothing in it that suggests that it's not intended to be read by anyone interested in the stories and beliefs of the First Americans.<br />The Mythology of North America is part of a series which includes books on the myths of South America and of Mexico and Central America.  I would also recommends those, though I think that the Mexico/Central America volume is the least successful of the three.	2000-09-24

Alas, NASA killed off that genre.  But Jablokov makes a  fair attempt to revive it with Deepdrive.<br />His gambit is to imagine a  future where the Solar System has been colonized by not one but 11 alien  species.  (You don't meet most of these creatures--do I detect the  beginning of a series?)  They've settled down in various places--some  burrowing under Venus' terraformed crust, some swimming in the seas of  Ganymede, some tunneling into various asteroids.  When's the last time your  read an SF book where there was something worth visiting going on on  Mercury?<br />The aliens are intriguing, too--though they come in many  varieties, mostly they seem to rely on biotechnology for most of their  needs.  Symbiosis seems to be the big galactic fashion, and the way humans  fit into this ecosystem was compelling.<br />The characters are pretty  three-dimensional, or at least solidly two-dimensional.  In fact, their  relationships give the book a lot of its drive, and when they split up  roughly halfway through, things sort of slow down.  Still, I did not find  this a hard book to get through.	2000-04-22

Neville is a highly Uranian individual.  Though one can tell he's making an effort to rein in his hobbyhorses, this book is  still heavily colored (too heavily, in my opinion) by his personal  experiences and prejudices.<br />This can be seen, for example, in his  upgrading of Uranus to basically equal importance in relationships with  Venus and Mars--a judgment I suspect few astrologers would concur with.   It's also reflected in some odd, unexplained choices--for example, leaving  out relationships between identical planets (Sun/Sun, Moon/Moon, etc.) and  omitting aspects between Mercury and all the planets from Jupiter outward.   Isn't communication a key part of relationships?<br />But most basically, his  idiosyncracy is shown by the elaborate scripts he lays out with virtually  each aspect he delineates.  &quot;Venus will do this, while Pluto will do  that&quot;--leaving aside the very important concept of free will, there's  insufficient recognition that any single aspect is just one of a few dozen  astrological influences on a relationship.<br />The book does cover the  quincunx aspect, which is often left out by other books, though the  readings of this aspect are almost always highly negative--often worse than  the square, which makes little sense to me.  Neville does thoroughly cover  composite chart reading as well as synastric comparison.<br />I don't want to  discourage people too much from buying this book--there is much insight  into astrological symbolism here, and for that it is useful.  But one could  wish it in a more open-ended and less dogmatic form.	2000-04-16

It's based on the familiar twelve animals, of course, but it makes a point of noting that the cycle actually continues for 60 years rather than 12, with each animal being linked in turn with one of the five  Chinese elements--you may know that you were born in the Year of the Ram,  but are you a Prosperous Ram, a Lonely Ram or a Ram Respected by  Others?<br />The book also includes information on your birth hour, birth day  and birth month (by the Chinese lunar calendar)--there's information in  here on how your month interacts with your year, making Chinese astrology  more dynamic than it sometimes is presented.   Various combination of hour,  month and year give you such interesting sidelights as your Career Star,  your Animal Bone Fortune and your Yearly God.<br />There's not much about the  theory or philosophy behind Chinese astrology, which may be good or bad  depending on your point of view.  I took off a star from my rating because  there are a couple of typos in the charts that make them a bit  confusing--you can figure out what they're supposed to say, but hopefully  these will be caught in later editions.  Still, I recommend this book as a  good introduction to the subject, and an excellent gift choice.	2000-03-11

The problem with this approach is that houses represent  areas of life, and inevitably--since there are 10 &quot;planets&quot; and  12 houses--you're going to have at least two and most likely more than two  houses empty.  Does that mean that those areas of life are going to be  empty?  If your 6th and 10th Houses are empty, will you never have a  job?<br />Karen Hamaker-Zondag, one of the most insightful astrologers I've  read, addresses this problem by using a different (I believe older)  technique.  She looks not at planets in houses, but to the planet that  rules each house.  (This is the planet associated with the sign at the  beginning of each house--if your 3rd House starts in Pisces, then Neptune,  which rules Pisces, is your 3rd House ruler.)<br />Since every house has a  ruler, there's something to be said about every house.  Mostly  Hamaker-Zondag interprets the house ruler in terms of the house that it's  in--so if the ruler of your 10th House is in your 5th House, your 10th  House activities will be motivated by 5th House matters--you might want to  advance in your career in order to express yourself.<br />While I think this  is an interesting technique, I wish there was more about house rulers in  this book.  It doesn't really talk much about the particular planet that  rules a house--what does it mean to have Uranus ruling your 7th House, as  opposed to say Saturn?--or what sign the house ruler is in.  It does cover  a lot of ground that isn't found elsewhere, but as a subhead, &quot;How to  Read the Houses in an Astrological Chart&quot; somewhat oversells this  book.	2000-03-11

I have read and enjoyed many books on astrology, but never before have I been as consistently amazed by the accuracy of insight into the personalities of  people that the authors have never met.  I think even many long-time  astrologers will be startled by how good a portrait one can draw knowing  only the Sun sign and Moon sign.<br />I doubt that any astrology text could be  100 percent accurate--occasionally there's a few false notes, and once or  twice the reading has been a complete miss.  But in the large majority of  cases, I have found that the analysis of each Sun/Moon type reads like a  description written drawn by a close, insightful friend of the  subject--describing specific qualities that would not apply to most  people.<br />I must have 75 astrology books on my shelves--this is the one I'd  recommend first, to a beginner or to a pro.<br />P.S.

If you're only planning to buy one book on love and astrology, this is probably the one to get.  It's a step above those books that ask you to compare sun signs with sun signs--which gives you only twelve different  possible relationships, and most astrologers would tell you that sun/sun  comparisons aren't all that significant anyway.<br />This book looks instead  at where the planets Venus and Mars are in your birth chart--planets that  are supposed to feature strongly in relationship stuff--and asks you to  compare your Venus with your significant other's Mars and vice versa.  This  is a more sophisticated, arguably more meaningful, and (most importantly)  more fun exercise than looking up and finding once again that Leos aren't  supposed to date Scorpios.<br />On the other hand, this book won't overwhelm  the beginner with the endless factors that an advanced astrologer would  take into account when comparing two charts.  Figuring out where your Venus  and Mars are couldn't be easier with the appendix in the back of the  book.<br />The book's take on each combination is clear refreshingly  non-foreboding--generally, Robert Reid offers you advice on how to get  along with someone rather than warnings about what will happen if you  try.<br />If you do plan to explore relationship astrology in greater depth,  this might not be the first book you'd want to buy--you might start with  Skymates, or perhaps Do-It-Yourself Relationship Astrology.  But you may  want to pick up this book later, as a useful reference.	2000-02-21

The stock elements of Arthurian  legend--the enchanted castles, the abducted princesses, the contests with  mysterious knights--are revealed to have a coherent esoteric meaning.As  Loomis writes, to understand the relationship between the familiar tales of  Camelot and the wilder Irish myths &quot;is to open suddenly the  mountainsides into the glittering palaces of the Sidhe&quot;--the home of  the Celtic gods.<br />The brilliance of Roger Loomis--who wrote in the  1920s--is that while he draws the same kind of fascinating connections as  Robert Graves, Loomis does so through careful argument and documentation.  His work should inform any serious discussion of the origins of the  Arthurian tales and the meaning of the Holy Grail.	2000-02-12

He makes a powerful case for the importance of a planet that is often overlooked or treated  blandly in chart interpretation--largely arguing from the charts of  well-known people, in a series of perceptive readings that are themselves a  great introduction to and argument for the art of astrology.<br />(Credit  should be given to editor Barbara McEnerney, who contributed several of the  chart readings--she and Arroyo should consider collaborating on a book of  famous charts.)  <br />The book includes full descriptions of how Jupiter can  be interpreted by sign, house, aspect and transit.  One big plus is that  Arroyo quotes what other astrologers had to say about these  factors--showing both common understandings and disagreements.  There's  also an insightful discussion of what Jupiter means in general, looking at  the planet in conjunction with Sagittarius (and also Pisces) and in  contrast with Saturn.<br />Even if you don't have a particular interest in  Jupiter, you'll enjoy this book if you like great astrological writing.	2000-01-23

I've been looking for a book like this for a while--a reference work for comparing one astrological chart to another.  (This is a practice known as &quot;synastry,&quot; usually done to discover if two potential lovers are  astrologically compatible.)  This is a long step beyond those books that  tell you if you're a Taurus whether you should go out with a Leo or not.  Why is this different?  First of all, it takes the whole chart into  account--not just the Sun, but the Moon and all the planets.  Second, it  tells you to start by looking carefully at each individual's chart--which  is essential if you want to learn anything meaningful about how the two  charts work together. There's a good deal of useful advice here about  relationships--and unlike many books on astrology, this one deals with what  your chart says about those times you are *not* in a relationship.    Sometimes the advice is a bit too traditionalist for my taste--it seems a  bit passe to be to be talking about &quot;natural or biological  roles,&quot; which means &quot;the male initiating and the female gladly  responding&quot;! It's not exactly clear who this book is aimed at--someone  who's a complete beginner at astrology may well be overwhelmed by  complexity.  Yet non-beginners will certainly not need the pared-down  ephemeris that takes up about one-fifth of the book.  The section on  planet-to-planet interactions is said to be &quot;the heart of the  book&quot;--yet you can't calculate these interactions with the information  provided in the book.  (The author offers to send you them for an  additional $10.) This book is probably most helpful for intermediate  astrologers--those who know their way around a birth chart, but haven't had  much experience with synastry.	1999-04-02

On one level, it's a mathematical fable, like Flatland--it finally taught me what it means that some kinds of infinity are bigger than others, a concept I have puzzled at since I was a child.  But it's also a more or  less autobiographical account of mystical (for want of a better word)  experiences that Rucker actually had--not exactly as set down here, of  course, but as close as he could explain them.  And at the same time it's a  psychologically realistic account of a young professor's professional and  marital problems.  And it's a fun, surreal sci-fi goof.  And it's a modern  version of Dante's trilogy.  Maybe it's an infinite number of books about  infinity!	1998-12-09

When you read this book you'll realize  that the correct answer to the question &quot;what's your sign?&quot;  is  &quot;all of them&quot;! Avery gives an analysis for each rising  sign--which is the sign in the 1st House--and in the process reads each  sign in each house. This is helpful, because houses are often  overemphasized in basic astrology books, and even when they are discussed,  houses without planets in them sometimes seem like they're  non-functioning--like if someone doesn't have any planets in the 7th House,  there's nothing to be said about their love life.  (Houses are a 12-fold  division of the sky, based on its orientation to the Earth--six above the  horizon, 6 below.  They're important because they allow one to relate  astrological symbolism to one's everyday life.) There are legitimate  criticisms to be made of this book--it does presume that the signs will be  neatly assigned one to a house, when in most house systems people often  have some signs covering two or more houses and other signs not ruling any  house.   There's not much explanation of how the rising sign connects with  the sun sign, moon sign and other chart factors.  If there were many other  books on reading houses in terms of signs, I might give this book three  stars instead of four.  But as it is, I would recommend this as a book that  most beginning astrologers would benefit from having on their shelves.	1998-12-06

The book mostly consists of descriptions of how each character  fares in each house, and what that means for you astrologically. But  there's problems with the book, some of which are inherent in the concept.   First of all, there's too much emphasis on planets being good in some signs  and bad in others--that's kind of an archaic mode of astrology and it just  makes people more neurotic, in my opinion.  By turning the planets into  characters, it makes them seem like something separate from  yourself--giving people the opportunity to say, &quot;That's my Mars in  Scorpio doing that, not me.&quot;  And Alexander totally equates the signs  and houses, as if they had no separate function at all--which makes  astrology both less interesting and less useful. I'm afraid this book would  be too misleading to get as a beginner's introduction to astrology.  As a  more advanced student, I found there were some interesting ideas in the  introduction that I wished had been more fully developed.   This may be a  case of astrology-made-too-simple.	1998-11-26

But if you want an introduction into the history and theory of the Tarot, this may be the book you want.  Giles' history is refreshingly  skeptical, compared to most Tarot introductions I've seen; the discussions  of the development of the Tarot ties it in to broader esoteric traditions.   I have to confess that I was unconvinced by her attempt to link Tarot to  quantum physics. One of the big pluses of the book is a lengthy annotated  bibliography of books on the Tarot, which gives you enough information to  make an educated guess as to which books would give you what you need.   (There's are also several reading lists scattered throughout the book on  various fascinating subjects.)  There's also a bibliography of decks, which  is helpful but could be more detailed. This book is more an introduction to  learning about the Tarot than a book about the Tarot itself; if you want to  read only one book, this may not be it.

She draws heavily on Jungian psychology in  her interpretation of the Major Arcana, and on numerology (filtered through  folklore and mythology) for the Minor Arcana, but in both cases she refers  directly to what's actually on the cards--helping the reader see them as a  coherent symbolic system, not just mysterious pictures.  (She mostly uses  the Rider-Waite deck, but gives an extended justification for her choice,  comparing it symbolically with other popular decks.) I don't know that I  necessarily agree with every one of her interpretations--but that's  actually one of the book's great strengths.  After reading it, I felt that  I understood enough of what was going on in the Tarot to begin to have my  own opinions. Hamaker-Zondag, who's a noted astrologer, includes a chapter  on attempts to combine Tarot and astrology--and concludes that it may not  be possible.  She also includes straightforward, common-sense advice on  how to conduct a reading and lay out the cards--instructions that are far  more helpful than those in other Tarot books I've read. The one thing I  don't like about this book is the title.  It sounds like it's inviting you  to join a cult.  It's really one of the most feet-on-the-ground  introductions you're likely to find.	1998-11-23

The tradition in Ireland was to name the firstborn son after the father's father, the firstborn daughter after the father's mother, the secondborn  son after the mother's dad and the secondborn daughter after the mother's  mother.  So from looking at the names of your Irish grandmother's siblings,  for example, you can make a pretty good guess as to her grandparents'  names. However, during the 19th Century and even before, Irish names were  being traded in for English-sounding names.  So your grandfather   Bernard  might be named after his grandfather Brian, or Anthony might be named after  Hewney, since both names can be used to anglicize the Irish name Uaithne.  This book is a big help with such translations.  It also provides a bit of  history on many Irish names, plus some guidance with pronunciation. It  seems like quite an impressive piece of scholarship. Also recommended:  Irish First Names, by Ronan Coghlan, which takes a somewhat lighter tone  but is still a useful reference.	1998-11-13

Lovecraft story written by Faulkner	This is a book that takes the familiar Lovecraftian, or maybe Derlethian, scenario--a young man inherits a house, is taken over by the spirit of the place and is destroyed by obsession--and explores it with deep  psychological realism.  The effect is uncanny: It's almost as if the  cardboard characters of the Lovecraft stories (which, don't get me wrong, I  love) have come to life. In order to sustain the realistic tone, the  supernatural elements all happen offstage--but if you've ever wondered what  it would really be like to be enslaved by a priestess of the Elder Gods,  this book is for you. This edition is out of print, but the novel is  reprinted in full in The Fred Chappell Reader, which is in print.  I have  to wonder what fans of Chappell, who is mostly a writer of Southern  Literature, make of a novel whose first words are &quot;Ph'nglui mglw'nafh  Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.&quot;	1998-11-13

I don't know if it's me or him, but reading &quot;Coyote  vs. Acme&quot; I couldn't help thinking that Frazier wasn't really laughing  most of the time, so I wasn't laughing much either. The title story and a  couple of others were pretty funny, but I would recommend &quot;Dating Your  Mom&quot; for more laughs and his other books to correct your overly  optimistic view of human nature.	1998-11-13

And the discerning reader will notice a difference in the depth and texture of  these stories as compared to the real deal. There also is considerable  repetition in the themes of these stories.  However, one of the odd things  about Lovecraft fans (myself included) is that imitation is not necessarily  considered a bad thing--the obsessive repetition of Lovecraft's themes  seems somehow a fitting homage to his helpless mortals drawn to their doom  by forbidden knowledge. My recommendation is to read the real Lovecraft  first.  If you like it, you'll probably think this is OK too.	1998-11-07

In tracing the history of star-gazing,  Evans traces the history of science, showing how ideas arose, migrated, stood up or failed  under testing, and were passed down through the centuries. One learns a  deep respect for ancient astronomers.   Almost 2,000 years before Columbus,  Greek scientists had figured out that the world was round, and had even  determined that the Earth was miniscule compared to the size of the  universe. Evans is committed to the idea of learning by doing, so he gives  detailed instructions on how to construct every instrument that ancient  astronomers used--from sundials to astrolabes.  The book is full of great  science projects. I would strongly recommend this book for those interested  in the history of science, ancient and medieval thought, backyard  astronomy... even astrologers would benefit greatly from this book.	1998-11-06

It's part of a subgenre of horror fiction known as the Cthulhu Mythos, which comprises stories that make use of supernatural  elements found in the stories of H.P. Lovecraft--mostly having to do with  evil godlike monsters (or monsterlike gods) that ruled the Earth before the  dawn of time. &quot;Dagon&quot; takes this premise, twists the genre from  supernatural horror to Southern gothic, and presents it with utter  psychological realism.  The result is shocking and fascinating--sort of  like reading a horror comic book written by William Faulkner. I wonder what  fans of Southern literature make of &quot;Dagon&quot;--there's a few bits  that must be baffling if you've never heard of Lovecraft.  But the rest of  the book isn't like this at all, so don't be scared off if this doesn't  sound like your cup of tea. This is surely the best-written Cthulhu story  ever.  But few Lovecraft fans will ever find it here, with a generic title  and a cover completely devoid of squiggly monsters.   (The novel, I should  note, has no squiggly monsters either--on the surface.  But they're  there--oh, boy, are they there.)	1998-11-06

Hidden amidst the funky robots, improbable drugs and far-out 21st Century slang is a fascinating argument for the actual, real-life existence  of immortality. The closest writer I can think of to Rucker is Philip K.

If you want to, you're under no obligation.  Highly  recommended either way.	1998-11-06

Otherwise, I would recommend this as a good book for aspiring writers to read:  The first few stories, written while Bloch was still in high school,  are downright bad--painful, clumsy imitations of H.P. Lovecraft.  But he  keeps on practicing, learns the basics of the craft, and before long is  turning out competent work; that is, pretty good imitations of H.P.  Lovecraft.  By the end of the book, he's finding his own voice, and is well  on his way to becoming the writer who invented Norman Bates.  It's  inspiring!	1998-11-06

Shaking off his Lovecraftian roots, Campbell wrote these stories to bring horror fiction into the present day--tales where nightmares happen in everyday life, though perhaps only glimpsed out of the corner of one's eye.   Campbell realized that the old techniques of elaborately building up  suspense had lost their force, and instead used understatement and  misdirection to scare the reader before they realized they'd been scared.   I know this is an overused word, but this book really is a masterpiece, and  well worth tracking down if it's out of print.	1998-11-02

Why don't I know that many large Midwestern cities were built on  the ruins of Indian cities?  Why are the monuments of these civilizations  to this day being torn down to make room for parking lots and golf  courses?&quot; The book tries to answer these questions, and points to an  amazing act of collective amnesia that was necessary to justify the taking  of the American continent from the descendants of these civilizations.  In  the course of tracing this willed ignorance, Kennedy provides great insight  into the thinking and characters of some of  America's first leaders--this  book greatly changed the way I think about Jefferson, and actually improved  my estimation of Washington. This book is an exciting read. It uncovers a  lost civilization, as fascinating as Atlantis--only it's real, and it's in  our own backyard.	1998-11-02

I've  found the symbols to add a new, more individual layer of meaning to an  astrological chart.  People who are drawn to Tarot would probably relate  strongly.

If you're interested in asteroids and astrology, this book is a must-have.  There are extended discussions of the four &quot;major&quot; asteroids, as well as briefer looks at some of the &quot;minor&quot; ones.  There's also  an extremely useful ephemeris of 16 asteroids, allowing readers to make  this still-evolving field a part of their own practice of astrology. For  George, the asteroids are a key part of a feminist astrology that  incorporates a great many insights from Greek and Roman mythology.  While  the mythic dimension was often valuable, I sometimes felt that the  asteroids had trouble standing on their own as symbols--ideally, the  asteroid Ceres should be as independent of the goddess Ceres as the planet  Neptune is from the god. One problem in any discussion of asteroids is that  there are so many of them; it's not really clear why the 12  &quot;minor&quot; asteroids she includes are singled out.  (The four  &quot;major&quot; asteroids are the first four to be discovered.)   She  organizes the minors into male-female pairs, which is problematic; since  the first asteroids were overwhelmingly named for female figures, the male  asteroids tend to be rather small and obscure pieces of rock. Quibbles  aside, this book is an important contribution to astrological literature  and a useful addition to an astrologer's library.	1998-11-01

It's a simple, straightforward introduction to astrological symbols; it presents a vocabulary of planets, signs and houses and teaches  you how to put them together yourself.

The great thing about this book is that it has an ephemeris, a chart that enables you to determine what degree the planets were in at the time of your birth.  If you only know the sign, which is the most that you get from  most &quot;all-in-one&quot; astrology books, then you can't really deal  with the interrelations between planets, a key part of astrology. The equal  house system is the only house system that the book offers, which is kind  of a limitation, though as a table for any other system can run 50 pages, I  understand their choice. There are full delineations of planetary house and  sign placements as well as aspects between planets.  These are clear and  refreshingly open-ended; there's a clear implication that the parts of the  chart have to be interpreted in terms of the whole. It's true that the  instructions of how to do a chart could be clearer.  And you're not going  to get a deep understanding of the basis of astrological symbolism from  reading this book.

There's a  good sense of each planet's distinct role; plentiful examples of people who  epitomize, e.g., Mercury in Aquarius are also helpful.

Hand, one of the leading astrologers of our era, goes back to the basics to try to discern the essence of each astrological symbol.  His discussion of why the planets  mean what they mean is amazing; his analysis of signs is equally revealing  and fascinating. I really recommend this book whole-heartedly on the basis  of those sections alone, but I knocked off a star because I thought that  other parts were much less convincing.  He roots his explanation of aspects  in harmonics, which is essentially numerology, virtually ignoring the  elemental basis of astrology which he lays out quite clearly when he deals  with signs.  And his treatment of houses seems almost willful in its claim  that these symbols have nothing to do with the signs. Nonetheless, this is  a great book, and one I would recommend to the non-believer: It gives a  sense of the depth and complexity of astrological symbolism, which has a  beauty and a spiritual meaning that is independent of the question of  whether birth times correlate with personalities.	1998-10-31

You can find an ephemeris--as well as more helpful readings of  what planets in signs and houses mean--from Parker's Astrology, a far  superior all-in-one astrology book. Much of Woolfolk's book has a  cut-and-paste feel.  There's a chintziness about the writing that is in  keeping with the choice of such a cheesy, mercenary title.  I'd like to  single out the section on synastry, or chart comparison, which is bad to  the point of being harmful. I give this book two stars rather than one  because it can give a beginner a general idea of what real astrology is  about, and may lead them on to more serious books.  So it has some value to  the extent that its title is wrong.	1998-10-31

That said, there's quite a bit of interest  here: The discussions of aspect configurations are more detailed than I've  seen elsewhere,  dealing in depth with different sorts of T-squares and  grand trines while also treating some rarer combinations.  The chapters on  unaspected and retrograde planets are also very helpful. Perhaps the best  thing about this book is its discussion of dissociate (out-of-sign)  aspects; these are a problem that many treatments gloss over, but Tierney  deals with them at length in a plausible way. I have a few gripes: Tierney  seems to derive the basic meaning of an aspect from the degree that forms  that aspect with the beginning of the sign of Aries; that seems like an  unhelpful and in some cases misleading way of looking at it.  He gives  quite a bit of space to discussions of &quot;upper&quot; and  &quot;lower&quot; aspects, which doesn't seem to me to be a useful  distinction. If Amazon.Com let me, I would give this book three and half  stars.  It's not the first book on aspects I would recommend, but it is  useful and I'm glad I bought it.	1998-10-31
