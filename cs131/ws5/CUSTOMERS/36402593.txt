Mr. Colfer has some great dialogue and settings here, and the plot moves quickly-- as evidenced by how much happens in such a short book. Also notable are the events he set in motion for Artemis's return to LEP knowledge, which play out perfectly in the next novel.<br /><br />There are a few weaknesses here, though. The biggest is the introduction of the new humans-- the mafia goons. They're unlikeable, which may seem a strange complaint for villains, but the rest of the series has held enimies that are likeably evil. The descriptions of how stupid and greedy they all are grows repetative, too.<br /><br />As I said before-- this is the weakest of the series, but that is merely a testament to how good the Artemis Fowl books are. Well worth your money, especially now that it's in paperback.	2005-07-09
US	36402593	R1NGLXV2SOX6H1	1573223026	929884077	A Long Way Down	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Quick but memorable read	Despite dealing with what you would assume is dark subject matter, Nick Hornby's A Long Way Down is a quick read filled with original characters-- perfect for a few lazy summer hours. <br /> <br />The most appealing part of Hornby's fourth novel is how he has thrown together four people that, before attempting suicide, wouldn't have been able to stand each other. It was interesting to follow their plots and plans to make money off of their experience and stay together as a group. <br /> <br />It should be mentioned that A Long Way Down is one of the funnier books of the summer, which is a plus in my book. Many of the laughs come when Hornby writes as casually-speaking teenager Jess. <br /> <br />If you want a book that will keep you well entertained for a day or two, A Long Way Down is the way to go.	2005-07-05

I really wish that I had read this masterpiece sooner. Yann Martel's retelling of another man's experience is something I won't be forgetting anytime soon. <br /> <br />I won't be giving away the twist in the book, but suffice to say that there is one. The writing is beautiful and really let me in on what it was like for Pi Patel to go through such a unique young life as he did. Martel's descriptions of India, the Pacific, and Pi's later home are quite detailed.  <br /> <br />If you don't take away anything else from this review, just remember: READ LIFE OF PI!	2005-07-05

I finished The Historian last night and I'm still in awe of how good it was.  <br /> <br />The story takes place throughout a dozen locations, mostly in Eastern Europe. It's chock full of character development, thrills of horror, and historical locales. This is what The Da Vinci Code should have been-- a deep novel of historical fact combined with compelling characters and situations. Perfect for summer reading, as it is almost 650 pages long. <br /> <br />But don't worry-- all the buildup is most certainly worth it. It has been a long, long time since I've read a climax as horrifying, exciting, and memorable as in the last pages of The Historian. I won't be forgetting the haunting final scenes for quite a while. <br /> <br />On a last note, I also liked how two stories were told at once through most of the book with the use of messages left in case of emergency. This was a great first novel from Ms. Kostova and I think her writing skills point towards great things in the future.	2005-07-02

This is Artemis Fowl at its finest and most mature, folks. A few pages in a main character is dead and the others are on the run. I was sad to see a certain character go, but it led to some serious character development (something that the series has always been good with despite the YA status) so it was worth it.<br /><br />If you've enjoyed the past three books AT ALL, this is worth your money.	2005-06-28

I enjoyed both aspects of the novel, although both ended a bit abruptly. The new authors do a good job but there are some plotting issues that make it clear that they are, indeed, new to the craft. <br /> <br />Overall a well-written book.	2005-06-17

During World War III, the Tribulation Force learns just how dangerous and evil the man is. They also face the difficult task of saying goodbye to their beloved pastor and rescuing a friend in Israel. <br /> <br />Nicolae is one fastest-paced books in the Left Behind series, and fans of the first two will enjoy the further adventures and tasks of the Trib Force, which really set up the rest of the series.	2005-04-25

It picks up from the cliffhanger in Nicolae, with the Tribulation Force (and the world) in chaos and searching for missing loved ones. SH includes the introduction of some memorable characters, Leah Rose and Doc Charles, the painful searches of Ray and Buck for their wives, and the discovery of a new safe house. <br /> <br />I can easily recommend Soul Harvest as one of my favorites in the Left Behind series.	2005-04-25

Central to the plot is the meeting of 144,000 Jewish converts in Teddy Kollek stadium in Jerusalem. Chaim Rosenwieg is brought back into the story, and Chloe has some pregnancy issues. Hattie Durham also makes her first attempt at bitterly making her way to Nicolae Carpathia for revenge. <br /> <br />From the cover it seems as if Apollyon and some MASSIVE LAVA EXPLOSIONS are central to the book, but they don't come in until about 2/3 of the way through.  <br /> <br />A great read for those who enjoy following the Trib Force.	2005-04-25

Not only was The Rising surprisingly character-driven, the writing was of good quality and Jenkins proved that he really had a good story planned out for the rises of Nicolae Carpathia and Rayford Steele. The book is mainly focused on Nicolae, his mother Marilena, and Viv Ivins, but Ray and Irene Steele get their fair share of coverage. Jenkins managed to make the son-of-satan storyline seem fresh and the ending of the book is probably the best-written conclusion in the series so far.  <br /> <br />I'm surprised to find myself looking forward to prequels 2 (11.15.05) and 3 (6.6.06) with much anticipation.	2005-04-10

That being said, I still love this book 10 years after first reading it. The plot is unique and the characters and their journies are interesting.

The fact that it was writter by one of the actual writers of the show (as was Vanishing Act) may have something to do with this. <br />By far the most realistic and show-like of the series, Sydney goes undercover in K-Directorate. The mission is tense and filled with twists, including the introduction of Anna Espinosa, Sydney's season one rival who will soon be returning for season four.   <br /> <br />If you're an Alias fan who's been considering reading the series, skip the others and read from this book on. And don't bother with Skin Deep.	2004-12-31

I think that it was the second best in the series, behind only  Infiltration by Breen Frazier. The book centers around Sydney's mission with two new SD-6 recruits and someone framing her for theft in Germany. Also, the events in Free Fall come back to haunt her as danger comes to UCLA. This book did a good job of tying previous installments in the series together, bringing Sydney and Noah to the last step in their relationship before he reappears in the show, and revealing what Jack has done to protect his daughter. All in all, a good way to end a good series (with some bumps in the road).  <br /> <br />Next May, the Alias APO (Authorized Personnel Only) series kicks off with Two of A Kind? by Greg Cox.	2004-12-31

The author has turned this around with The Slippery Slope, which is one of the most entertaining and important books in the series. The Baudelaires meet a survivor of the Quagmire fire and attempt to rescue Sunny from Olaf's troupe at the summit of a frigid mountain, all while trying to extract information on VFD from the burnt-out headquarters they discover.

They are quickly rescued by a member of V.F.D. and his daughter, along with a surprise character from The Miserable Mill. The story is entertaining and original, but not quite as captivating as some of the previous tales-- until the end, that is. The Baudelaires are betrayed and return to the place where everything started, Briny Beach.

Now, as Lynn Mason's second entry into the series, she combines the best of both of those books in DISAPPEARED.<BR>It seems as if the main character, Sydney Bristow, has really grown up and is learning how to do things on her own and handle a full mission. The plot clipped along at a rapid pace but didn't leave anything to be desired, and the ending had a twist that was something I'd expect from the show's brilliant writers.

Yes, it was just as good, but instead of being about thrills it focused on the very essence and drama of human emotions, family ties, and love. Peter David wrote a very solid adaptation of a movie that mainly focuses on the character of Bruce Banner and triggers his mutation- mentally and physically, which is nice when you're expecting a huge exploding popcornfest. Ang Lee, Bruce Banner, and Jennifer Connely look to have a winner here. Don't expect this to make a much at the box office as Spider-Man(the average American might not be able to fully comprehend it)but here's to what was a good story and should make a great film.	2003-06-12
