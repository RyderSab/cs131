This is a book about using your intuition to understand situations and how to read people.  As with books about intuition, it takes using your intuition or imagination and having facts that makes this book make sense.<br /><br />Simply put, each story shows us how intuition is used in trying situations or in critical situations where a judgement must be made. How the experts just seem to 'do what they do' without explaining it, or how sometimes we interpret what we see, ignore what is obvious and look back and wonder why we did not pick up on the clues.<br /><br />If you wonder 'how do they do that?' when you observe an expert, Blink can answer that question some of the time.  An expert can make a decision using a flash of insight, or as with war, use their overall resources to make a decision in the heat of battle.<br /><br />In the introduction he says he wants us to find the value of 'a blink of an eye' and see that it sometimes is as valuable as deep rational analysis. Then, we see the anecdotes for what they are, rational analysis in the blink of an eye at times.<br /><br />There seems to be subjects here for everyone, an eclectic look into decision making, not scientific completely, maybe even a stretch, but the book is such a quick read as to really keep your interest.  I liked his analysis of sports figures, Ted William for one.  Williams said he watched the ball hit the bat when would hit. The book reveals that in reality, that is just not humanly possible. It was something else, Williams,  an expert, doing what he did best, could not fully explain how he did it.<br /><br />Interesting too is Gladwell's review of the science of reading faces.  I was fascinated that the human face has so many expressions that, according to research, may reveal what someone is thinking.  My only concern with that, may be that a flash of expression, may be an initial thought, followed by reality.  However, if someone is continually flashing an expression, it may reveal some deep seated feelings.  One case he uses is in a court room where someone flashes an expression of discust. It is brief and we are not sure where that evaluation is leading, so, was the person discusted at the question or the facts behind it?  How can we know?<br /><br />Blink will open up some very interesting perspectives for you who read it.  I think it was worth my time and money spent.  I believe that we cannot judge (condemn)others from expressions, but awareness of the world around us is really something we all need.reveal some deep seated feelings.

After paging through it, I realized, this author is the real deal.  He is approaching the whole subject of the collapse of societies and environments in general from a 'centrist' or middle of the road view. What gets me is that Jarred Diamond's writing style is factual, passionate and interesting.<br /><br />Diamond's ability to compare facts with facts and his passion to communicate a need in a balanced way will get anyone's attention.  What he writes is a warning to us all, especially in the West where we seem to have it all and live in a comfort zone that belies the realities of our environment.<br /><br />When he writes about Montana, I was stunned at what I learned about how a relatively pristine environment with so much potential is in the process of continual spoiling.<br /><br />I was really impressed with his review of the history of Easter Island.  What seems like a fantasy island is really such a disaster when you go deeply into the history, development and demise of an isolated island.  As he uses Easter Island as a metaphor for a globalized world, he warns us that without knowing it, we could be in for a greater disaster than we realize with no outside help or any new place for humans to run to any longer.  As with the past, there was somewhere to go. Today, there is no new world or open space for us to resort to.  We have to protect what we have.<br /><br />I do like the middle of the road perspective.  His book is not a diatribe, nor does it excuse the misuse and destruction of the environment by big business.  The concept is, we have to live, so then, how do we in order to sustain life?<br /><br />Overall this book takes the concept of sustainable development and makes it real world and so much less a reactionary or radically based subject.  No, quite the contrary, it is rational.	2005-02-23

This is wonderful information that actually is practical and opens the door for both learning to give to each other 100%, not only that, but giving 100% to the others language of love.<br /><br />Learing love languages is actually fun.  Relating to each others language of love is even more exciting.  Once you learn whether your spouse loves touch or gifts, or even loves conversation, you will open new avenues for intimacy and closeness.<br /><br />I think Gary Chapman has found a solution to the problem of continued closeness in a marriage.

Michael writes a beautiful tribute to his family and how much he was loved by his father and how welcome he felt when he was with him.<br /><br />I was touched by the stories of President Reagan's last days.  I will save that for you to read, because if you cried during the Reagan funeral, a tear will well up in your eye when you read this.<br /><br />More than anything, Michael writes about hope in a potentially dark world.  His personal experience becomes a lesson for us all at how serious we need to take whom we leave our children with.  The lesson is poinant and not so graphic as to upset the reader.<br /><br />I like this book and recommend it heartily.	2005-02-08

The layout is a little awkward to get used to at first, but the research about the texts and the amount of time GA Riplinger put into her work must have been a ton.<br /><br />You will learn about the meter of the KJV, the source of the texts as she always discusses.  But behind her support for the KJV she now goes backwards and shows how the Wycliffe Bible, the Saxon Bible and the Gothic Bible all agreed or fit with the KJV.<br /><br />You will also learn about men who were important to bringing us the KJV including two very important figures, Wycliffe and Erasmus.  She devotes almost 100 pages to Erasmus' life and teachings and how he was persecuted for his beliefs.<br /><br />This is an amazing book for Biblical Research.  If you are interested in delving more deeply into the workings of textual criticism, Riplinger's book will be a great guide to get you through it.	2005-02-07

The Angst of the radical left, not the liberals, is what David Horowitz is saying allies itself with radical Islam in it's hatred for the USA.  I am non-plussed as I read about the leftists who slam America no matter what we do.<br /><br />He quotes Norman Mailer saying we caused the deaths of thousands in the Shi'ite areas of Iraq by not finishing the first war, then he condemns us for going in there.  The first Iraq war, the UN did not want us in.  So, with the left, no matter what we are wrong.<br /><br />I was reading with interest another book, entitled the Subverters, written in the 70s.  He mentions in there, the communist block supported the original terrorist movements of the late 60s and early 70s.  The more things change, the more they remain the same.<br /><br />When I look at the book, overall, I am impressed at how much the ultra left perspective and goal matches that of Radical Islam.  Not Islam, Radical Islam.<br /><br />What impresses me is what David writes about the Ayatollahs and others who have espoused ideologies similar to that of the left.  When the Soviets went into Afganistan to take it over, the left said and did nothing while hundreds of thousands died.  When the US goes in and averts a famine, they blame us for causing one.<br /><br />What gets me the most is the rhetoric against America, by Americans, one very famous left wing writer going to Pakistan to incite Pakis to defy America's attempt at going in after 9-11.  The only view these people believe in is the ultimate destruction of the United States.  Horowitz does admit that one of those opposed to the US and patriotism actually hung out a flag after 9-11.  But he too changed his mind, his stripes for a lack of a better term and basically sees red again.<br /><br />This is a great book for those who still can discuss the right verses left ideologies and the like.  The outcry of the left takes an issue and propounds it to the extreme.  One way we can save the day and bring our nation back to an open dialog is to recognize when an idea or ideal or issue is outside the pale of reality and inside the scope of Marxist doctrine.<br /><br />May clearer heads prevail as we work through the issues surrounding our current state in the war in the gulf and the potential for continued terror on a global basis.ose opposed to the US and patriotism actually hung out a flag after 9-11.

It reads like a novel or a suspense thriller.  However, the focus on the Enron like economics and money going to the large developers sounds a little trite and like whining.<br /><br />To lend money to foriegn countries is nothing new.  In fact, if you remember the 80s, many of these countries defaulted on loans because they could not pay them back.  For the US to use monies to build infrastructure for poor countries, which actually used the money to build infrastructure made and makes actual sense.  It used the best technology in the world to help poor countries build a basic framework in which an economy could prosper.<br /><br />We tend to have selective amnesia or simply are too focused on 'reality TV' and sports to remember how many leaders in countries wanted our money so they could do what they wanted with it, you know, pocket it.<br /><br />America was made all the richer by lending monies to Europe after WWII, Western Europe is prospering today because it lends money to foriegn countries with the expectation, in writing, that those funds would be used to buy products made by the EU.<br /><br />It would be interesting to track Perkin's history to see just how true it is.	2005-01-28

It is more than just an idea that takes off, it is the communication and the one who creates and maintains a vision.  From the Innovators to the Laggards, there is a reason that products, concepts, standards and new ways/fashions take hold.<br /><br />I particularly like the concept of groups of 150.  I have been in larger organizations that had a core of people.  I remember one time mentioning that of one group consisting of 330 people, 150 made up the core and they all were what drove the larger group.  Whether that is scientific or not is another matter.  It is the factors of communicating a vision and moving forward with that vision that creates a new idea.<br /><br />The author mentions the concept of the broken window and not fixing it leads to a worsening of an environment.  Interestingly, I witnessed a turn around of a small 'downtown' that went from empty, sometimes burned out, store fronts to a thriving restaurant row with movie theaters and sports bars and the like.  In the 90s it became a happening place.  How did it get that way?  Someone applied the principals that are listed in this book.  A vision was created that eventually lead to a thriving commercial center, breathing new life into an area that was considered dangerous.<br /><br />I like the story about graffiti.  In LA where people reduce or eliminate gangs hanging around if they immediately wipe graffiti from properties where it has been painted.  That concept applies in caring and if no one cares about the paint, they will not care if other crime occurs.<br /><br />The Tipping Point if anything, is a good book to help you evaluate yourself to see if you have the ability to communicate a new vision, if not for the world, maybe for yourself.ew vision, if not for the world, maybe for yourself.	2005-01-28

My review below still stands, but updated as follows.<br /><br />Bolles' advice on the new realities we are struggling under is very pointed.  There are jobs and ways to find them if you know what you want and where to find them.<br /><br />I still think if people were to use this book as a workbook it they would discover so much about themselves.<br /><br />Bolle's book is still timeless for job seekers of all kinds. I feel that his book updated each year to meet the current trends in society is critical. He needs to address those issues, like the web, downturn in the economy and the like.<br /><br />The most critical part of the book is the self evaluation section. This is a very structured process that can be used intutitively as well. Bolles asks you to write a few stories about yourself, then, what did you like and dislike about those stories? What did you do well, where did you fail or feel challenged beyond your abilities? These are the critical areas of the book that take time to get through, yet you can evaluate yourself and understand what you like, it is what you do best, usually.<br /><br />We excel what we are good at, according to Bolles, this method will help us discover what we are best at.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to many over the years, and still do. Whether someone is in college, or someone is going through a long term transition after being in a job for a long time or moms returning to the work place, this book will be very instructive for you.<br /><br />One of his processes is very simple asking you to compare who you would most like to talk with or groups of people you would rather relate with. This is a standard set of tests for some very expensive career consulting, he gives it to you for the price of his book and the time to self evaluate yourself. Then, he breaks down the possible job areas and skill sets related to these groups.<br /><br />Again, a worthwhile journey for anyone not wanting to wander any longer in the world of work.<br /><br />JOE SLEVIN<br /><br />Job Coachworthwhile journey for anyone not wanting to wander any longer in the world of work. <br /> <br />JOE SLEVIN <br />Job Coach	2004-12-30

Elaine does a great job in making this history lesson live, comparing the earliest church with the final formation of the estblished church after the Nicene Council.<br /><br />Pagels links the early church through Polycarp and Iraneaus to the Nicene Council at the time of Constantine.<br /><br />She leaves out some very important details that would make this a very complete picture of the time.  In the book she alludes to the St. Thomas Christians in India but drops the subject when there is a definate connection with their practices, the practices of the early church, Polycarp's beliefs, Iranaeus' beliefs and the impact on those beliefs at the adoption of the Nicene Creed.<br /><br />Not only were there the Gnostic Christians, but the \\"Jewish Christians\\" whom she mentions briefly but could have had that as yet a third broad group.  The Christian world at the time was a great Mosaic and Pagels in order to focus attention on the discovered \\"Gospel of Thomas\\" versus the \\"Gospel of John\\" must have limited herself to the most known themes.<br /><br />The time was also rife with Arianism and Semi-Arianism among others that she also mentions but could delve more deeply into.<br /><br />In the Gospel of Thomas itself is only a reference to the Saturday Sabbath and the keeping of it.  The importance here is that the St. Thomas Christians were said to be Sabbath keepers (Saturday) by St. Francis.  She touches on the Nicean Council but fails to tell of how it was an attempt to limit Judaistic influences in practice at the time.  Why this is so important is the Sabbath quote may provide some additional insight to the origin and focus of the letter.<br /><br />Having read the Gospels and having read what the Gospel of Thomas states, it seems more like a collection of sayings attributed to Jesus as opposed to an actual synopsis of his life.  Unlike the 3 Synoptic Gospels, it talks little of his walk and interaction with his disciples and those in Judea.<br /><br />Many of those sayings are directly from scripture or from what is accepted as the Canon.  Some of the sayings do not seem to square with what was Jesus taught, but you will have to get the book and judge that for yourself.  I would rather have rated this at 3.5 for the conclusion and a 5.0 for the history lesson.<br /><br />I hope Elaine Pagels expands on this work to talk about early Christianity as a whole with the tapestry of the whole time period.  That would add to this work and with her writing style add to the understanding of that day.s disciples and those in Judea.

Now there are some who may argue that the Saturday Sabbath was for the Jewish people only because he was talking with Jews at the time, yet, Jesus, you know, the God or Yahweh of the Old Testament gave the Sabbath to the Israelites, 12 tribes not just to Judah (with Benjamin and Levi, the Jews today.)<br />Also, the scripture stated that man was to keep 'THE' Sabbath day holy not 'A' Sabbath day.<br />However, this book introduces the topic. Yet is the day for our pleasure or for God's?  Although man was not created for the Sabbath to be it's slave, the Sabbath or 'THE' seventh day was created for mankind or made at the time of creation for all to keep.	2004-07-07

Wondering to myself, how could I use this to have fun with my family if we lived in a space with, of all things, space.<br />This book not only shows how to make catapults of various types.

I was poor when he took office, and his vision gave us all new hope and my life improved tremendously by the time he left office.<br />His life, over 10,000 letters written, shows that he was a man of great personal depth and conviction for his family, his friends, his nation and the world we live in.  I would imagine that if those who have written things about him on these and other pages were to express their anger to him for his failings, he would sincerely express his apologies for the shortcomings he had.  We cannot blame him for the AIDs epidemic, he did not start it, nor could he do anything to finish it.<br />When he started his presidency he was surrounded on all sides with one crisis after another.  We had double digit inflation, a flagging economy, we almost lost one of the big three automakers and hundreds of thousands of jobs.  He gave us hope, and he touched all Americans collectively as he touched the lives of the many individually through what he wrote to them.<br />His dignity was beyond any of the negative any could say about him.  What we all need to ask is, what have we done individually to aid the poor, to help those with AIDS, to help promote peace and share our prosperity with the world?  Could we write to encourage and inspire as he did?<br />&quot;A Life In Letters&quot; is a wonderful tribute to a man who embodied faith, love and friendship.  He gave us a hope and a vision, and he shared that with us collectively as he did with those he wrote to individually over the years.	2004-06-11

He reviews throughout the book not only recent history, he links it to the over 200 year relationship the French and the USA have had together since the American Revolution.<br />He likens our relationship to a marriage of sorts that is now on the rocks as Collin Powell put it, \\"in marriage counselling\\", with a change in the overall environment since the French decided not to assist us in Iraq.<br />This is a side of the story that only an insider can tell us about.  Yes we did help Iraq against Iran in the '80s.  Yet the French have assisted Iraq since then in building armaments and the French have resisted helping us in the war on terror in tracking and capturing known active terrorists.<br />Anyone who thinks that we are in the war for the oil may be enlightened by this book because oil and the rights to it is one of the reasons the French did not decide to back our decision to go in.  In fact they undermined us to a large extent along with Germany.  This new perspective, one which has grown through the years is possibly a result of the power that France shares in the new European Union.  However, most of the EU states sided with us, along with Spain, Italy, Poland, because we share a common history with democracy.<br />One of my favorite quotes in the book is from Collin Powell, however it is truncated to; \\"We've asked for nothing but enough land to bury them (our soldiers) in.\\"  What Timmerman left out in this quote was that Powell was responding to accusations at a meeting in Europe where America was accused of attempting to take over the land of Iraq.  The implication of Powell's response was that we did take land in France, when we liberated it in WWII and helped defend it in WWI.  That land was the massive graveyards that are at places like Omaha Beach and Meuse-Argonne.<br />Timmerman discusses the WMD issue, although none have been found, he felt at the writing of the book, that Saddam had the time to hide or destroy WMDs while the UN inspection carried on for months at a time.  He mentions just as with an audit turning up fraud, the onus is on the one caught to come up with the goods.<br />It seems that the WMD issue is mute at this point, however, there is still the issue of the support of global terror and Iraq's involvement therewith.  Timmerman chronicles some of that from a perspective that includes an allusion to Ahmad Chalabi.<br />I would be interested in Timmerman's take on Chalabi since the firestorm surrounded him a few weeks ago.<br />This issue of the book however, is not WMDs.  It is the selling out of the USA by France and how that relates to the overall war on terror.<br />Timmerman is a very interesting writer.  He holds your attention throughout this book as he does in his other successful books.  This book is well written and well documented.  Time will tell if this book is just His-story or a view of things that have really happened behind the scenes in the war on terror.laces like Omaha Beach and Meuse-Argonne.<br />Timmerman discusses the WMD issue, although none have been found, he felt at the writing of the book, that Saddam had the time to hide or destroy WMDs while the UN inspection carried on for months at a time.

She was nine years old when Mr. Reagan's 90th birthday rolled around and did not understand his importance to her nation and to her dad.<br />Robinson's book although a little unsung in the world of great books, is a tribute to a great man yet, it will also influence any who read it apply the Ten Maxims that are the subjects for each chapter.<br />The Ten Maxims Are in My Words:<br />When life gets difficult, dig in.<br />Do the work you are intended to do.<br />Life is a stage, act now.<br />What you say matters.<br />Use the brain you have been given.<br />Take things in stride.<br />Marry the right person and it will help your life.<br />Remember to pray daily.<br />Use your God given talents to influence the world around you.<br />You are important and can make a difference.<br />These maxims of life, seen through the life and actions of one of Americas greatest presidents are ours to learn, to understand and even to use.<br />This is a great book.

But you will have to read the book to find that out.<br />I have a lot of questions though.  Why was the point to suppress this information if true?  Why is an investigation not in the offing?  Look at the book American Jihad, it states much the same about the US not exposing what was terrorist activity, simply calling occurrences criminal activity.<br />This book is well researched, footnotes are easy to follow and they have some done a lot of work to bring together this information.

He starts off with the facts and details of where three major disease epidemics, two human, the other animal, and attempts to build a case that Plum Island was the location that they came from.<br />Carroll makes you think as he compiles interesting facts obtained by interviews, investigation and information gotten by the freedom of information act.<br />Anyone who is wondering where some of the exotic diseases in the USA today, where they originated and the like will be very interested in this book.<br />Carroll's book is well documented, however, his endnotes lack numbers that link quotes and sources, which can make it a little difficult to track the evidence he uses.<br />All told though, Carroll's book definately compiles very interesting evidence that may point to Lab 257 as the source of our recent epidemics.	2004-05-17

I rated this a '2' simply because I am assuming this is supposed to be funny.  Yet wondering how many will take it as how they truly should be?  I did not see anything in the book to indicate it was supposed to be funny or light hearted.  There are people who believe that the opposite sex needs to be manipulated and treated with disdain.  If this is really what the book portends, controlling men, who are all dogs, not just compared to dogs, then I would not recommend that to my worst enemy.  Yet if the intent is light hearted humor, it seems a bit warped in it's sense of heavy handed man bashing.	2004-03-20

Compiled over 20 years, this book was a long time in the making and from the list of other books and calendars has a following.  This is a good book for introspection and for looking at during trying times or when we need to be reminded of the beautiful things in life.  The 3 rating was due to hoping there would be a little detail as to why she was happy about those things and why we could be too.  However, like art, I guess she wants us to come up with our own list or agree or not with hers.	2004-03-20

Sometimes I read the interlinear instead of the KJV English because there may be a hint of meaning that the translaters may have overlooked.<br />Features about the book I like and use often:<br />1.  The Greek letters, pronunciation and use in the front of the book.<br />2.  The Interlinear Bible itself.<br />3.  The Greek dictionary in the back that defines many of the words, derivations of the Greek word and other scriptures it is used in.<br />This is by far the best Bible Study tool to have near by when doing any type of study.  Use it for subject studies, comparative studies (if you are looking at the NIV or other revisions), specific word studies (to understand the meaning and the context in Greek).<br />There are very few KJV study tools that are not influenced by the revised text.  This one is completely free of that influence and if you are a traditionalist this is definately for you.	2004-03-17

The basis being TR is very important because it gives the sense of scripture from that text.<br />Some feel that the Revised Version is more accurate and the debate will continue for decades, yet to have this tool for TR/KJV only studies is very informative.  Too many will miss out on the importance of this book because it is KJV.  However, whether you believe the TR is the correct text or the Revised, this is a must in your library.  You can compare to the Strong's numbers, however, remember that Strong's tends to be influenced by Classical Greek definitions and not the koine.<br />I feel George Ricker Berry's translation is very helpful and it is much less expensive and without the Strongs reference is still a great buy.  However, to round out your library, get both.	2004-03-17

The pope letter mentioned Sunday keeping, yet Bacchiochi argues that an hour of church on Sunday cannot in anyway come close to the commandment regarding Sabbath keeping.<br />His arguement, it should be a 24 hour period and be kept on the seventh day, Saturday, not on Sunday.  His discussion is that if the Christian churches were to keep a day, that would be better than an hour, yet, he says, it is best to keep the day that God intended from the beginning of creation.  He says that Sunday can never replace the Saturday Sabbath in its meaning for all Christians and it's meaning to God.<br />This is a must book for anyone who is a Sabbath keeper being challenged on his or her beliefs.  This book, although not foundational, can give support to the Biblical Sabbath to any Sabbath keeper.	2004-03-03

It will open up new avenues for your understanding as to how the church changed over the centuries and will give Sabbath keepers more information to support their claim of Sabbath keeping.	2004-03-03

Maybe he feels there are too many moderate individuals out there touching the subjects he is in this and his other book so he needs to be on the reactionary side of the equation.<br />I rated this book a three for a couple of reasons.  What he is addressing needs to be aired, yet, his invective shows a lack of true Christian love for neighbor...<br />Savage actually can cause some who accept his point to become depressed.  His name calling and so called 'righteous anger' is aimed more at people than at the wrongs he claims they are committing.<br />...<br />When he called a name or a label it was not a play on words or what we would consider vulgar.  Savage's use of the English language in this book is vulgar, yet he touts that as okay.<br />Our society is in need of conversation to save it from dissappating, yet, to have continuous villification of individuals creates anger at them.  Our society eventually will be more polarized with none in the middle or no one who can stand for a balanced view of life, true liberalism, you know freedom with responsibility.<br />The subjects he broaches here need review, yet in a more tasteful manner.	2004-03-02

As some have said, it may have been better if Zell became a Republican, however, Miller mentions that he was raised a Democrat and will die one.<br />Interestingly, earlier in our history the only difference, for the most part, our parties were very similarly conservative with the exception of financial issues.  Times have changed, yet Zell Miller reflects on his life as a life long Democrat decrying the lack of direction of that party and what he sees as it's demise.<br />Democrats can use this book to envigorate them to have or develop a specific vision.  Republicans though, should not allow a book like this to put them to sleep thinking the Democrats are through.  An election is coming, be aware, the Democrats will fight to win this one at all cost.	2004-03-01

Hannity attempts to answer that there is evil in the world in which we live, do we really see it?  Should we be concerned?<br />Asking the question, is it evil when someone who is supposed to be a safe person to deal with abuses a child, is that not in fact evil?  Was Saddam, with all of his corruption, death and murder around him, not evil?  Can we deny evil, even though we may or may not believe in absolutes, we can say something evil happens in this world.<br />Hannity's book is an attempt to garner the Republicans and other conservatives to see the effect of the leadership of GW Bush especially since 9-11.<br />His concern is that as a nation with a Judeo-Christian ethic is hated by Muslim extremist, not all Muslims.  Yet, in our country we have a concern from some on the liberal side of the equation that we should not be promoting Christian rhetoric in our international affairs, especially when it deals with the Muslim world.<br />A liberal society, though, is one where we are free to express our minds.  Hannity feels that the current political climate is due to the upcoming election and it has caused the Democratic party to distinguish itself at a time when we should pull together to fight the War on Terrorism.<br />Hannity's insights are definately defined by his point of view as a conservative.  It is a well written book, but again, not for all.  Those who consider themselves Liberals or Democrats who do not consider themselves may not like this book.	2004-03-01

The Chinese symbol for crisis also means opportunity.<br />This book shows that throughout history, some of the greatest became that way because they had the forethought, and sadly, sometimes the foreknowledge, of events that they took advantage of them and won in a big way.<br />The title of the book comes from Lord Rothshild's statement about when blood is running in the streets, invest in a future.  Of course, what to invest in is really the question.  This book will give you a look to see and evaluate the opportunities that are out there.<br />Although the book was written in 1987, it is a now book, filled with facts of how to take advantage of a market.  Hey, did Warren Buffett read this?  Or did he understand the concept of &quot;Blood in the Streets.&quot;	2004-02-23

This book is so timely coming so soon after Tug McGraw's demise from cancer.<br />He reviews his loves, his relationships with his families, teammates and fans and his struggles after retiring from baseball.<br />One chapter that is fascinating is the chapter devoted to fans.... It is a fitting tribute to his fans from someone who always enjoyed playing for them.<br />Tug admits in this book his wild lifestyle as a baseball player and attributes part of it to his somewhat wild homelife growing up.  McGraw shows how he was the life of the party, a team player and a person who inspired others.<br />His sense of humor was amazing.  His vignettes about his jokes throughout the book will make you smile.  He even devotes a chapter to his humor.<br />You will cry as you hear about Tug's challenges in his life and most of all the last few years of his life struggling with his illness.  Yet, Tug's legacy would not be complete without his family and it is touching and fitting what he says about them.<br />Interestingly Tug talks about three heroes of his; Babe Ruth, Benjamin Franklin and the King; Elvis.  He tells us why these men's lives had an impact on his life.  Tug shows that he was a deep person, with a depth of passion for his life, his family and his work.  The discussion of Ben Franklin was so very interesting.<br />This book is for anyone who has come from a challenged family background, anyone who loves the music of Tim McGraw, and of course the many fans who enjoyed the life of one of America's favorite Relief Pitchers - Tug McGraw......Ya Gotta Believe.	2004-02-23

From her first adopted child from Romania being neglected to the love of her first born child and seeing a difference that love and attention can give to a child.<br />Jen relates to us that having stability in one's childhood will lead to a stable up bringing for our future adults and a stable society in general.  Morse tells us how having a moral code that will guide children through their lives.  The touch, closeness, warmth and love of a family environment is needed, so much so, to grant a strong foundation that a child can build on.<br />Loving guidance, warmth, direction and loving discipline will give a child the direction they will need in life.  It will give them a view, a vision, of where they are going and where they need to be.<br />It takes the family to raise a child; to positively affect a village, town or city; to influence a nation to greatness.

Do we have the time to do the busy work to be effective, or do we do the important things first so that other things get done in priority.<br />This book is an excellent primer for the Franklin/Covey time management program.  By focusing on our time the right way, we may be on to greatness.  Yet, it may be a better book for managers.  Some positions in the world we work in are just busy work.<br />Maybe Mr. Covey can cover that at a future time.	2004-02-20

The writing is very pedantic in places and sounds like proverbs that were translated in to English, at first.<br />Yet the descriptions the writers have of the first Gulf War and the outcomes and lessons learned from there are incredible.  To see the changes in our methodology in Iraqi freedom being outlined before we fought was also astonishing.<br />This book outlines the methods of fighting only one foe, the USA.  They mention a number of times 'the myth of America's invincibility' and then describe the many methods we are vulnerable.<br />The list includes, economics, biological, our infrastructure, our natural resources, weather, ideological, media, information technology and our military.<br />China has the numerical resources to fight a multi-tiered battle with us if they choose, when the time is correct.  Yet, that would be a time when they would feel that they needed to.  The economics of it would not serve China's best interest, nor the worlds.  If they were to attack America and attempt to be the only superpower in the world there would be another dark age.  However, if another country were to use these methods, yet were able to replace the bread basket and other resources of the USA, then the war supposed in this book would be a possibility, actually, a reality.<br />Some who have read Sun Tzu's art of war will recognize some of his strategy in this book, feigning weakness, ideological warfare and the like.  It is a slow read at first, yet, once you get through the first chapter it picks up.<br />You must read the footnotes, however, they are not just sources they include additional material that gives a fuller picture and essense of the book.  My only question is, why do we produce so much information that our potential enemies can use it against us?  China will not use this, however, other enemies, mostly rogue groups with hatred for the US will.	2004-02-16

Tammy Bruce has an opinion that many are assaulting our right to have an opinion.  Tammy defends those who would not agree with her lifestyle and those who may actually condemn her lifestyle.  Interestingly she supports the conservatives in their right to have an opinion.<br />This book is a warning to America that we need to be able to state an opinion, whether left, right or center.  Bruce is not promoting the right to slander and villify someone, however, she does support ones right to say that something is not correct without being labelled politically incorrect.<br />America has values as a foundation to our society.  Is is possible for either side of an issue to debate without accusation and reprisal?  Her main foundation is the insanity that surrounded Dr. Laura and her attempt to get on TV after she discussed homosexuality on her radio program.  Bruce breaks down the matter for us to show how Dr. Laura's freedom of speech was attacked.<br />The reason Bruce is concerned here is because she does not want that right taken away from anyone, by anyone.  At what cost is it that we lose the ability for dialogue?<br />The New Thought Police is a good book for any idealogical point of view.  That is my opinion, was this review helpful or am I going to get a no because you don't agree with the conservative approach of the book?  Please, rate the review....not the perspective.	2004-02-15

He has a twist in this book, from a Jewish perspective, he attempts to show how Paul is writing to Jews and Romans to consider one another as brothers, to emphasize toleration.<br />Nanos' thesis is that Paul was writing a correction to both, neither should think more of themselves than what they should.  It was not the Jews who thought too much of themselves, it was he Romans who were thinking they were more than just simple Christians.  His reference to Romans 9 is very insightful.<br />It is a difficult read, written mostly to a more educated audience, however, it is a good tool for anyone who has a desire to understand the depth of scripture from a Jewish perspective.<br />If only all christians would remember that the early church was originally all Jewish until the conversion of the Samaritans.  The core of Paul's work was done in synagogues and Jews were among the converts throughout Europe and Asia Minor.<br />Nanos goes a long way to reveal a much needed dialog between Christian and Jew.

You will learn about how Jacques De Molay was tortured and see some potential proof that there may be a relation.	2004-02-04

Lives were not transformed for the better and Christian love was left somewhere in the lurch.<br />The Sabbath keeping legacy does precede the SDA/Sabbatarian Adventists contrary to the chart that Tkach has in his book.  Sabbath keepers can clearly be linked all the way back to 1525 in Germany/Moravia, through the Seventh Day Baptists, who called themselves 'church of God.'  Even Ellen G. White mentions that the person who wrote about the Sabbath in early Adventism was himself a freewill Seventh Day Baptist.<br />There were many things non-cultish about the WCG, people were well travelled, educated, employed.  They understood world events.  They could tell you who world leaders were and the issues at hand.  Yes, as with any other group of people, there were extremes.<br />The transformation written of here is from only one perspective, as expected.  Yet the full truth of the happenings behind the scenes are for another venue.	2004-02-04

His theology apparently does not effect what he writes in this book.<br />There are many things of interest in this book.  Learning to read a coat of arms is very thought provoking.  Learning about the Duke of York's coat of arms is even more interesting.<br />He takes a whole chapter on British Israelism, indicating that the Prince knows this idea and embraces it.  He also reviews that the Prince is now the defender of faith, not the defender of the faith.<br />However fancy this book may turn out to be, it is an interesting read on royalty and on the Prince in general.	2004-02-04

It was practical, like a training class, the picture that shows perspective is a real eye opener.  I think that is what really got me to continue to read.<br />Do we live from a limited perspective and perception or are we willing to take life by the horns and live it the way it should or could be lived.  I have read a lot of self help books and time management books in my life, Covey's book had a real effect.  Those who know the scriptures will see he uses biblical principals, his Seek first to understand then to be understood principal is 'be quick to hear, slow to speak.'<br />I too recommend Principle Centered Leadership as a must read.

Books	5	10	14	N	N	Whether true or not, I liked this book	If this book is full of facts we as a people have much to worry about regarding the power that our leaders wield.  It has a twist in the JFK conspiracy type of books.  He backs it up with facts, pictures from a different perspective and a number of things that compile quite a bit of circumstantial evidence.<br />The smile on LBJs face during his swearing in as President on Air Force One was somewhat surreal.  However, does circumstantial evidence really stand up to the test.<br />He does open up a lot of new territory for research and discussion.  Does anyone care any more though?  This book is very readable.  If anything it is a great book for understanding LBJ as a person and his approach to his office as President.  Pray that this is not true.

I think it is well researched. He will not appeal to those who are ecumenical in nature because he still espouses the ideals of the Protestant Reformation.<br />Grady's appeal is in his treatise on not just the KJV but those bibles that preceded it.  Anyone wanting to understand how we got the English bibles must read this.<br />The argument is, the Textus Receptus verses the Revised Version and its tranlations and versions.<br />Grady does a good job chronicling the translators from Wyclif to Tyndale, down to the KJV translators.<br />There will be many detractors to his findings.  Unlike the anti-KJV books which have weaker arguments and more emotional arguments, Grady pulls no punches.<br />What he needs is to appeal to all audiences by mentioning the hatred for the KJV from some audiences.  A must read for those researching the KJV only study.  (I call it the Textus Receptus only.)	2004-02-03

Barbara simply exposed truth that we as a people are often too busy or careless to look into.  Is it hate to expose that so many were released from prison on the last days of a Presidency?<br />To keep our people free we need to care about what happens in our government.  This book has a lot of sources, and quotes are usually without right wing invective.  I think Barbara's book hit the mark on information we needed to know about for our future.

I was amazed that so many of my conservative friends purchased the Closing of the American Mind yet how few if any actually read it.  I heard quotes from the book, yet they were always taken out of context and people referred to the book yet did not seem to know anything about it.  I asked a PhD about the book and he only wanted to know whether the title was proper for the book, I guess he had not read it either.<br />Platonism is mentioned a lot in other reviews, my interest though is the acceptance of German Rationalism in America.  de Tocqueville said that if America ceased to be good it would cease to be great.  He said America was great because it was good.  One book I was reading at the time was Sun Tzu'z Art of War, he states that when your enemy has accepted your ideas and philosophies he is no longer your enemy.  Tzu mentions that when you come to fight, your enemy will not want to because there are no differences.<br />By our acceptance of German Rationalism have we forgotten what has made America great?  Will we forget that although we have a common ancestry with Europe, we are a distinct people whose ancestors came here to escape the world that was Europe.  Whether escaping religious persecution or a potato famine, those who came here sought the freedom that came with responsibility.

Johnson touches on all of the major issues that influenced the world that formed what became the late eighties and early nineties.<br />He begins with a comparison of the theory of relativity and the concept of moral relativism and how the two somehow intertwined to create a morally relativistic world.  Much of what we see today is a world where things are done expediently, and morality is relative to the situation.  Moral relativism lead eventually to the wholesale slaughter of millions through war and other depravation.  Yet, man kept learning.  He revised Modern Times to include the fall of the Soviet Union, which when he first wrote in the mid eighties was still a threat to the free world.<br />IN order to read this book in its entirety, one must get through the introduction.  If one has never read Paul Johnson, it may be slow going at first, yet, once you understand his thesis, you will be delighted at his view of world history.  The read of this text is captivating.  From the Bandung Generation to America's suicide attempt, the lessons for all who dare to see, may we learn from history and not repeat the mistakes of the last century.	2004-01-29

The Intellectuals could actually be considered a primer for Modern Times.  The two books are much better together, if you read the one it is good to compliment it with the other.<br />Johnson's description of how Sarte's ideology shaped modern Europe.  With Sarte being born in Alsace/Lorraine, his German upbringing influencing French thought, and then being exported back to Germany was nothing but a amazing.<br />He does touch a little too much on personal issues, yet, he does expose people who were idolized as mere humans, not demigods.  To think that thought alone could change the world as it has.<br />His challenge to us might be framed 'was rational thought really rational and did it have the effect that the thinkers really intended?'  Does someone who is for the worker so much exploit others while promoting a doctrine of fairness?  Does he take care of his own?<br />This is a very interesting book for anyone interested in seeing behind the scenes of those who have shaped the thoughts of the world we live in.	2004-01-29

Because of the myth surrounding McCarthy and the angst against what he did by most who were effected by him, there is a lot of misinformation about him and what he attempted to do.<br />This is an eye-opening account of those days compared with todays opposition by those in Hollywood to the Iraq war and the war on terrorism.  Anne has facts and quotes and footnotes to back up her information.  It is well researched.<br />Can we get to a true dialog without rhetoric from either side? War is not just, yet do we ever not fight?  She tells of those who complain about fighting who punch camera men in the face to protect themselves.  Is that not war, in a sense?<br />Read this book with an open mind and reserve judgement until your read the full story she is attempting to tell.<br />Anne's book reminds me of 1984s thought crimes.  She comes out swinging and does not pull any punches.  I saw her on Hannity and Colmes.  Every time Alan asked her questions he would interrupt her answers and she told him off.  At first she was rubbing me the wrong way, yet as I watched I understood that she was being tenacious.<br />Her tenacity shows in this book.  Has anyone dared to tell this story but Anne?  McCarthyism as it is called is not a very popular subject and Anne tells us why.  From the revelation to me that McCarthy was late to the party in investigation of communists in American Government to the quotes against the war on terror, which seem to have crescendoed recently.<br />Whether one is a conservative or a liberal, if one could read this with an open mind to investigate some fact, there is much to be learned.  Anyone, especially someone with a left of center ideology may and probably will be offended by Anne's sarcasm.  In fact, she tends be repetitive in that point sometimes repeating whole phrases about the same people and situations.<br />I would have rated this a 5 if the book focused more on the facts and the outcomes and was less polemic with the infusion of occassional liberal bashing.  Yet, you have to admit, when you do have facts, you need to cry it from the housetops.  If only we could hear what is being said without offence.<br />What we really need in our country is a dialog while we defend ourselves.  Can we do so without anger and predisposition and prejudice of opinion.hole phrases about the same people and situations.<br />I would have rated this a 5 if the book focused more on the facts and the outcomes and was less polemic with the infusion of occassional liberal bashing.

Whether you agree with her conclusion, the facts she state about the newer versions are amazing.  Interest how all of the new versions tend to agree against the KJV, and you find, they all have the common text, a new one based on a compilation of 4 manuscripts.  The KJVs Textus Receptus is based on over 900 manuscripts.<br />The arguement, instead of KJV only, should be Textus Receptus verses the Revised Version.  The research leads one to look into what is presented.  Anyone interested in the scriptures can get a parallel Bible to prove her point regarding the changes and how they all stand against the KJV.<br />This book has lead to an interesting study in Tyndales works and the Geneva Bibles, both preceded the KJV, and the KJV retains over 85% of the those translations text readings.<br />Riplinger presents her arguements in a clear way, somewhat trite in places, a little poetic, yet it does not diminish the importance of the work.<br />Most importantly, one should read the last section first, it gets to the real proof of what was done, who dislikes the KJV and why, then you can use the scriptures to prove her points.<br />I do agree that one when writing such a book should limit condemnation of others, not all she says about others is accurate, yet, if one separates the wheat from the chaff and looks for the serious arguement that there is a very clear text for scripture, this is it.	2004-01-28

He affected so much change in Japan and was not known here in the USA.  The chief reason for his lack of success here was probably that eliminating fear, one of his 14 points, has never really been a management method of American Management.  Today people fear losing jobs, his method of quality was to lead to more jobs and more quality utilizing American pride in work.  I do think his method had an impact, look at companies like Xerox, and others who continually improved, yet, our economy is so short sighted, we never seem to get past the view of everything this Quarter...we need to have a broader perspective.  I find my coworkers in America to be very hard working people who have pride in what they do and accomplish.

There is old history and new.  The interesting area is that of the Ethiopian Sabbath keepers who were constantly persecuted.  From the early church starting with the Ethiopian Eunich to today with the many Adventist and Church of God groups Sabbath keepers have a heart and desire to keep that day in spite of hardship.<br />Bradford does a great job showing how African Christians are heartfelt and hearty in their beliefs.  These Christians already struggle in the lands they live in, yet, the Sabbath communities are very united and strong.<br />With the growth of the Sabbath church of God groups, Bradford should expand his research using this as a jump off point to show how Adventist, church of God and Wesleyans have a common starting point.<br />This book is a good read for any Sabbatarian wishing to learn about the Sabbath keepers in Africa.  Not much is mentioned about earlier Sabbath history, like the Sabbatarians of Ethiopia.  For Christian Sabbath keepers, it is nice to learn that the Sabbath has been kept in Africa for more than 100 years.

There are many references to the church of God and how the church of God was persecuted and pronounced anathema.  The number of martyrs are in in the multiples of thousands.  4000 known names, but references to 10s, 20s, 50s, 100s martyred by various methods as horrifying as it may seem, christians killing christians in the name of Jesus Christ who died for us all.
