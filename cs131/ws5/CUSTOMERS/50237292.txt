It's lucky that his knowledge of Islam isn't pivotal to the story, because there are numerous errors (though not quite as glaring as, say, those in Matthew Reilly's \\"Scarecrow\\" or Tom Clancy's \\"The Teeth of the Tiger\\").<br />* \\"Keller's Adjustment\\" (Lawrence Block) is a character study about an unusual assassin. I haven't read anything else by Block, so I can't really say much more.<br /><br />The not-so-great:<br />* \\"The Corn Maiden\\" (Joyce Carol Oates) didn't live up to its billing (\\"a spiral of destruction and despair\\"); its language shifts on a dime from educated to stilted, and it's badly edited, too (one character's surname is spelled *four* different ways).<br />* \\"The Resurrection Man\\" is a fictional biography of a man doing a necessary, but despicable, job in the 19th century. It's fascinating, but rather thin on plot.<br /><br />The great:<br />* \\"Hostages\\" (Anne Perry) is the most \\"literary\\" of the works here, but it's still a compelling read about the tragedies of human nature.<br />* \\"Archibald Lawless, Anarchist at Large\\" (Walter Mosley) would make a great novel.<br />* \\"The Things They Left Behind\\" (Stephen King) is an elegy about life, loss, and ultimately hope, in the wake of 9/11. [It's also the shortest novella in the anthology by far.]<br />* \\"The Ransome Women\\" (John Farris) is an unusual love story, and a perfect entertainment for a rainy night.<br />* \\"Forever\\" (Jeffery Deaver) introduces Talbot Simms, cop/statistician. He's an intriguing character, and I'd love to see him get a full-length novel of his own.<br /><br />All in all, a great read; even the not-so-great novellas are still worth the time.	2005-05-16

So while this is a thrill ride, the book delves much deeper  into the many \\"whys\\" at work in our lives: even the things we think of as being random often aren't (and that holds true in the book--Fawer manages a few real surprises at the end). And Fawer's characters are particularly vivid, especially the protagonists, David and Jasper Caine.<br /><br />My favorite parts of the book were the sections when Caine puts his \\"talents\\" to work; Fawer does an outstanding job communicating the joys, and terrors, that would have to accompany such a remarkable gift. Perhaps best of all, though, the book leaves the door open for further adventures by the brothers Caine. If Fawer writes them, I'll read them.	2005-05-08
US	50237292	RLTER577S2A5J	0765305933	455739641	The Carpet Makers (Orson Scott Card Presents)	Books	4	12	12	N	N	A disturbing tale	Eschbach's debut work (in English), this isn't really a novel per se, but more a collection of related tales set around a central theme: the hair carpets. While other reviewers see profound similarities to Orson Scott Card, I also saw a connection to Philip K. Dick, and his bleak view of humanity.<br /><br />The book doesn't rush through things; as a result, the full nature of the situation, which is revealed only in the final chapter, becomes all the more shocking; the individual tragedies that befall many of the characters in this book are only a prelude to it.<br /><br />Yet it is in that final chapter--and not the epilogue, which seems almost inevitable--that the book almost falls apart. I have trouble fathoming *how* the \\"present\\" state of affairs could have developed as it did, although I can believe Eschbach's explanation as to *why* it might happen (I would be interested to see what German readers had to say about it).<br /><br />In short: this is \\"literary\\" SF in the grand tradition. It's not action-packed, but it will stay with you long after you finish the book.	2005-05-03
US	50237292	R546TPR5MVDMJ	0312319169	863828045	Company Man	Books	5	3	5	N	N	Another winner from Finder	\\"Company Man,\\" like \\"Paranoia\\" before it, is an outstanding read. And, like \\"Paranoia,\\" it managed to keep me in suspense almost the entire way through.<br /><br />The major difference between the two is the novel's focus: while \\"Paranoia\\" was primarily about cutthroat corporate warfare, \\"Company Man\\" is much more of a personal drama, focusing on Nick Conover, a CEO whose life is in tailspin, both personally and professionally. There are obvious similarities between the stories of Conover and Adam Cassidy (the protagonist of \\"Paranoia\\"), but they are by no means carbon copies: Conover is older, more successful, and somewhat wiser, though not more intelligent.<br /><br />I must give Finder praise for not spilling the beans too early, either: it wasn't until the last few pages that I really had an inkling of how things were going to turn out--and even then Finder still maanged to surprise me without cheating.<br /><br />All in all, I found \\"Company Man\\" a real pageturner, and I eagerly await Finder's next novel.	2005-04-11
US	50237292	R1U8H0HWYN0AN0	0553804146	245113934	Life Expectancy: A Novel	Books	5	13	15	N	N	Koontz breaks some of his clich√©s	At this point, it's hard to describe anything Koontz writes as completely original; he's written so many books that, any sort of criticism aside, you're bound to recognize certain plots and/or characters from previous books.<br /><br />That said, \\"Life Expectancy\\" differs, in some ways, even more from the norm than did Koontz's previous offering, \\"The Taking.\\" Perhaps the most obvious is the fact that this book is *not* set in Southern California, unlike nearly every book Koontz has written in the past decade. Likewise, the narrator and protagonist does *not* physically resemble Koontz, and there is little preaching or moralizing. [I did think of Dr. Evil midway through the book, though; if you've seen the first Austin Powers movie, you'll understand why.]<br /><br />Jimmy Tock is a convincing narrator; while other reviewers have been put off by his tendency toward glib humor (it reminded me of some of the banter in \\"Cold Fire\\"), removing that humor would have made this book as bleak as \\"The Taking,\\" which I really don't think Koontz wanted to do. [Personally, I would hope that, were I in Jimmy's place, I would be able to laugh on those \\"terrible days\\" as well.]<br /><br />You can read the basic plot summary above, so I won't regurgitate that; let me simply say that I was constantly surprised by where the book is going. In particular, I didn't expect the final part to turn out as it did, especially after having read \\"Odd Thomas,\\" so I must give Koontz credit for managing to pull one over on me.<br /><br />This is another quick read; I read it cover to cover in just a few hours. I can certainly recommend this book to Koontz fans, and I'd suggest it even to people who aren't big fans of Koontz.	2004-12-04
US	50237292	RFPY0KQA8XQFB	0849943728	822018095	Three	Books	4	6	6	N	N	An interesting idea	Reviewing a book like Three (or Thr3e, as the cover proclaims) is rather difficult: at its heart lies a rather unusual premise. I say \\"unusual\\" rather than \\"unique,\\" though, as I have read another book with a similar premise (naming that book would give away the secrets of this one, so I'll only say that it was published by a well-known author in 1991).<br /><br />The premise works well, here, although there are a couple of scenes where, in reflection, you have to wonder exactly what is going on (for example, how, exactly, would the events of the first chapter take place?).<br /><br />I will give credit to Dekker for creating a truly twisted villain-like figure in Kevin Parson's adopted mother. While I had a bit of trouble believing that a household like the one \\"Princess\\" runs could last for thirty years, I nevertheless found it plausible and disturbing, which I think was exactly what Dekker wanted.<br /><br />Finally, I should add that this is not so much a Christian novel as a novel about religion and faith; I am glad about that, as I am not a fan of novels that read too much like sermons. This wasn't the first Dekker book I've read, and as long as he keeps writing like this, I'm sure it won't be the last.	2004-11-24
US	50237292	R2HHSZPL1XCXHD	0446531081	880645124	Hour Game (King & Maxwell)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Good, but not my favorite Baldacci novel	That honor still goes to \\"Last Man Standing.\\" \\"Hour Game\\" is not bad, but it's not quite perfect either.<br /><br />It's well-written, and fast-paced; I read the entire book in much less than a day. The plot, though complicated, is tied down about as nicely as one could expect, and the banter between King and Maxwell is a nice touch in a relatively dark novel.<br /><br />There are three reasons, though, I didn't give this book 5 stars: one was that the ultimate solution just didn't sit well with me; I can't say very much without giving away large portions of the plot, but somewhere just before the killer is revealed, I realized it had to be a character I was hoping was innocent--and, in fact, I admit Baldacci had me convinced he was innocent. [Baldacci says the killer is male in the first chapter, so this isn't a spoiler.]<br /><br />Secondly, and much less importantly, there wasn't a whole lot of character development in this book. If you haven't read \\"Split Second\\" (in which Baldacci introduced King and Maxwell), these characters won't seem very three-dimensional; you don't *need* to have read that book, but it does flesh out those characters.<br /><br />Finally, there is one point where Baldacci basically gives away the game. Again, without trying to reveal too much, let me suggest this: once you read the book, go through and re-read the death scenes. One of them in particular will stand out as different from the rest; while I didn't pick up on it at first, in retrospect it was blindingly obvious what Baldacci was trying to do.<br /><br />Again, let me reiterate that the above complaints aside, \\"Hour Game\\" is better than your average read, and I would certainly recommend it to any mystery/thriller fan.	2004-11-18
US	50237292	R37R41NTM889JW	006042995X	144555088	Inorganic Chemistry: Principles of Structure and Reactivity (4th Edition)	Books	4	26	27	N	N	Comprehensive, but not complete	This book was used in a class I nearly took in college; while I couldn't fit the course into my schedule, I kept the book.<br /><br />What the book does, it does well: for example, its coverage of the noble gases is quite extensive. It also does an excellent job covering acid/base chemistry, going into far more detail than any book I had seen to that point (although its approach tended to be descriptive and qualitative rather than quantitative).<br /><br />That said, there are some significant gaps in the book: for example, while there is a chapter on the halogens and noble gases, there are no corresponding chapters for the other element groups (though that doesn't mean they aren't treated).<br /><br />The biggest flaw in this book, though, is the woefully inadequate index: there are many, many things that should be listed, but aren't. For example, the book uses a certain type of diagram in three different chapters. Only the second and third instances, though, are listed in the index; the first time, where the diagrams are actually explained, is not listed at all. Similarly, there are very few entries for the elements themselves: there are no entries *at all* for hydrogen, iodine, copper, or calcium, just to name four.<br /><br />All in all, it's still a very good book, but it's by no means perfect (or the only book of its kind). Large sections of the book are written at a relatively advanced level, so I certainly wouldn't recommend this for someone who hasn't had a significant chemistry background, but I would recommend it for someone trying to build a reference library.	2004-11-17

Perhaps the most important line on the book jacket is the last (emphasis mine):<br /><br /> &quot;Scepters is a stirring climax to the *first* Corean trilogy.&quot;<br /><br /> This book, while clearly built on the foundation of the first two books, is essentially a hybrid of &quot;traditional&quot; SF and fantasy, something I haven't run across in the other Modesitt books I've read (which number a dozen or so), although such a turn seemed fairly likely to me after reading &quot;Darknesses.&quot;<br /><br /> And, as this book is *not* the last book Modesitt intends to set in this universe, it is only fitting that he doesn't give up all the answers here (for example, he never explains how the changes to Alucius and Wendra on Corus take place--or if there is a deeper significance to them). There are tantalizing clues as to what has gone before, but a lot of questions still remain.[For example, how did the Matrial &quot;bring her destiny&quot; to Hieron?]<br /><br /> There are obvious similarities between this series and the Recluce saga, although there are major differences as well (among them, the lack of an obvious good-evil dichotomy in the Corean Chronicles). The Recluce books jump around in time--they cover periods spread out over a thousand years in the history of that land--so I'm already wondering whether the next Corean trilogy will be a prequel or a sequel.<br /><br /> You'll have a hard time understanding what's going on in this book if you haven't read the first two books in the series, &quot;Legacies&quot; and &quot;Darknesses.&quot; Read those two, then enjoy this one.	2004-07-22
US	50237292	R2LP8KBENMDVZ4	055380250X	303170656	The Taking	Books	4	11	13	N	N	Typical Koontz fare, though not quite	It's somewhat hard to write a review of Koontz's work (this is my first, after having read over a dozen of his books); to a certain extent, he's one of those writers you either like or don't like.<br />Koontz's work is notable for sharing certain characteristics, and this book is no exception:<br />* The southern California setting: check.<br />* The protagonist with an evil/malicious father: check.<br />* Disdain for psychiatrists/psychologists: check.<br />* Preternaturally gifted canines: check.<br />* A male protagonist who happens to have about the same build as Koontz himself: check.<br />One noticeable difference with this book, though, is the tone: it is much more relentlessly bleak than most of his other novels, although it did remind me of &quot;Seize the Night&quot; (the second of Koontz's Christopher Snow books). Likewise, Koontz's trademark doggerel verses are completely absent from this book, replaced here with quotes from T.S. Eliot (whose works play a significant role in the novel).<br />I must agree that most of the characters in this book come across as relatively two-dimensional--especially compared to the protagonists of his other books. I'm also not sure I agree with the &quot;philosophy&quot; Koontz uses to explain things, although it pretty much does explain everything that happens. [I'm being deliberately vague so as not to spoil the ending.] That said, though, this nightmare vision moved at such a quick pace that it didn't really matter.<br />If you've read other Koontz novels and liked them (especially &quot;Strangers&quot; or the Christopher Snow novels &quot;Fear Nothing&quot; and &quot;Seize the Night&quot;), this one is definitely worth checking out.	2004-05-27

[On the other hand, this seems to have been corrected for the third edition.]<br />Major con #2: the cross-reference system borders on the idiotic. The first time the title of *any* article appears, it is boldfaced, even if the context is essentially irrelevant.<br />Major con #3: it has a lot of depth in what it covers, but it isn't useful for reference on &quot;deep&quot; topics (e.g., if you want to know about optics, this book is good; if you want to learn about Fermi-Dirac statistics, go elsewhere).<br />All in all, if you can get this really cheap, try it. If not, though, you might be better off buying, say, several volumes of the Cambridge Encyclopedia series: you'd get more depth for the same amount of money.	2004-04-24
US	50237292	R2RD1U19JJPAES	0765301296	440256923	Nano	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Not a great book, but It'll make a good movie	A previous reviewer noted, quite correctly, that the science in this book is over-the-top. That is without question true. There were also a number of scenes that work on paper, but really don't hold up well when you stop and think about them.<br />I am convinced that *almost* everything in the book *could* happen. It is highly unlikely that all of it will come to pass, although I strongly suspect at least some of it will. My biggest doubts, though, are twofold. First, I doubt that some things can reasonably happen (the way Marlow describes the nanomachines, for example, makes it unlikely that they could do some of the things he claims they could do), or at least in the way he says they do (such as creating a redwood tree in a few seconds). Second, I don't think that all the applications of nano would be discovered or unleashed &quot;simultaneously,&quot; as the book requires.<br />This book is by no means perfect, and it does seem almost more a polemic than a novel. But at least it argues that this brave new world, even if perilous, is also one of nearly limitless potential. [If it had argued that nano is all bad, I'd probably have given it two stars.] Given how likely it is this technology will change the world in our lifetimes, I would recommend this book to just about anyone.	2004-04-15
US	50237292	R3DZMC9FMRWP4X	0691099839	275548265	Gamma: Exploring Euler's Constant (Princeton Science Library)	Books	4	45	48	N	N	Far-reaching, but not &quot;popular math&quot;	I debated for a while whether this book deserved four stars or five. There's a lot of very interesting material here: if there's one thing this book does--perhaps better than any book I've read in quite some time--is show just how interrelated far-flung mathematical concepts can be (how are the prime numbers related to pi, for example?).<br />My one complaint about the book--and the reason for giving it four stars instead of five--is that there are times when the formulae and notation get so dense that it's extremely difficult to follow the author's train of thought: I can think of a number of places where diagrams would have helped immensely. Likewise, since there's no list of symbols or formulae, it's not a book that you can simply browse through, in the sense that you can browse through, say, &quot;A Brief History of Time.&quot;<br />Finally, let me reiterate that this book assumes that you already know a fair amount of math: if you don't know what a capital pi means, for example, you're probably going to have a hard time understanding this book. But if you *do* know what that symbol means, though, then by all means, give this book a try.	2004-03-02
US	50237292	R3IGIRGTPG8BX	0765305445	699615905	Phobos	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Strange world, strange case	The biggest mystery in Phobos may not be the case Peace Corps lieutenant Mike Brogue is sent to solve, but the universe in which Phobos is set. Some of the backstory is filled in, but many questions remain unanswered (at least for now--the ending suggests a sequel).<br />The mystery itself is an engaging one, reminiscent of another debut novel, Matthew Delaney's Jinn. While that novel used writing gimmicks to create shocks (such as withholding necessary information), this one doesn't. If anything, the book reminded me of an episode of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (and this is a compliment): before long it is clear that there *is* a rational explanation for everything that's happened; it's up to Brogue et al. to find it.<br />The book moves along at a fair clip, with enough suspense and intrigue to carry you through to the last pages. If Drago writes a sequel, I'll definitely read it.	2004-01-12

First off, it is very different than its predecessor, The Talisman, despite the many linkages between them. Certainly, though, you'll enjoy Black House a lot more if you read (or re-read!) The Talisman first. [As just one example among many: the beer produced by the Thunder Five's microbrewery shares its name with a very different brew in The Talisman.]<br />Likewise, this book is intimately related to the books in King's Dark Tower series: there is one scene about two-thirds of the way through which will make absolutely no sense unless you've read the first three Dark Tower books (The Gunslinger, The Drawing of the Three, and The Waste Lands). Likewise, the ending of this book suggests possibilities of what may come in the final Dark Tower books (to be published in 2004).<br />All of that said, Black House is still an excellent book: it moves from humor to horror, longing to mourning, action to reflection seamlessly. I read this book a while ago, and there are still plenty of scenes that I read over and over again.<br />So: read The Talisman, and the Dark Tower books, then read Black House.	2003-11-14
US	50237292	R1R7LEIYYF5EYN	0765308029	661895496	The Ethos Effect	Books	5	10	12	N	N	A timely follow-up to &quot;The Parafaith War&quot;	First things first: the dust jacket says &quot;Set in the same universe as The Parafaith War (but two centuries later, and intended to be read independently)&quot;. While this book *will* make sense even if you haven't read The Parafaith War, I would strongly recommend reading that book first, for two reasons: on the one hand, The Ethos Effect gives away much of the plot of the first book; on the other, reading The Parafaith War will make the actions of characters in this book much sharper.<br />I won't say too much about the plot of the book--since I don't want to spoil either of these books--but I can say that I was swept along, and I certainly didn't see many of the plot twists coming. [This is surprising, as some of these twists were, in fact, presaged by comments made by characters in The Parafaith War.] The book is also rather more politically-oriented than The Parafaith War; fans of Modesitt's &quot;The Ecolitan Enigma&quot; should enjoy this book.<br />There is little in the way of graphic material in this book; Modesitt more than makes up for this, though, with thorny ethical dilemmas--ones which are not clearly resolved, and both condemned and applauded. A number of parallels are drawn between the events in the book and events in the world today, although you'd be hard-pressed to tell who's who. Modesitt suggests a solution to the problem--but is it the *best* solution? And is it a just one?<br />As in The Parafaith War, Modesitt presents a story, and invites you to decide what *you* would do in the same situation. It ties up some of the loose ends from the previous book, while leaving some questions unanswered. The door is left open for yet another book in this universe; if Modesitt chooses to write it, I will certainly read it.	2003-10-06
US	50237292	R20TC51V9XNOPW	0312276702	279899986	Jinn: A Novel	Books	3	5	6	N	N	An ambitious, but flawed, debut	For a debut novel, Jinn is an amazing ghost story; the book contains some of the creepiest scenes I've run across in a while (stuff that would make the forensics people on CSI nauseous). For that alone, I would recommend reading it. Unfortunately, the book does suffer from serious problems that made it hard to get through.<br />First off, as other reviewers have noted, the editing is significantly worse in this book--and the lapses more obvious--than in most hardcovers I've read recently. Likewise, in an effort to keep the book from running 600 pages or more, the publishers opted for very small print and very narrow margins.<br />Combined with Delaney's choice to eschew chapters, this makes reading the book something of a chore. [For some reason, Delaney inserts 'datelines' at certain points, but doesn't include them in others, where it would make just as much sense to do so.]<br />More importantly, though, the book is almost crushed under its own weight: the book is as long as it is, in a sense, because it has to be; the plot, as it stands, probably couldn't be shoehorned into a shorter book. Nevertheless, in order for the plot to work as it does, Delaney has to &quot;cheat&quot; the reader; there are certain things we expect to find out, but don't--perhaps because Delaney felt giving us those facts would spoil the plot. [I'm being rather vague because I don't want to give away the plot.]<br />So, while this wasn't the best book I've ever read, Delaney certainly shows promise, and I look forward to his next book.	2003-09-15

This book will be far less satisfying, and far more mystifying, if you haven't.<br />Like \\"Legacies,\\" \\"Darknesses\\" falls into roughly two equal halves: the first is basically a military story, more \\"good guys versus bad guys\\" than \\"Good versus Evil.\\" Modesitt deftly makes points about the fallacy of suborning defense to greed, and of the double-edged nature of Alucius' Talent: without it, he may not have a life; but if others learn of it, his entire way of life is threatened.<br />Of course, like many fantasies, Alucius has far more Talent than most, and seems predestined--regardless of *his* desires--for Great Things. Perhaps the most interesting thing is that many characters seem aware of Alucius' destiny, though he does not.<br />In the second part, by turns more magical, Alucius must use his Talents to stop Evil Forces that threaten Corus. He learns some surprising secrets about the Cataclysm--why it happened, and who caused it.<br />There are a few \\"Meanwhile, back on the farm....\\" sections that don't really contribute to the current plot--but other sections of the book show that these sections are probably foreshadowing events in later books in the series. And while the ending is a happy one, there are some highly unsettling questions left unanswered--and Modesitt is capable of some compelling surprises (e.g., the true nature of the Duarches).<br />This series has some intriguing ideas: similar to the \\"Recluce\\" series, darkness can be a good thing; the past is seen, convincingly, through various lenses (though this is more evident in \\"Legacies\\" than \\"Darknesses\\"); and the aforementioned mixed blessing of Talent (in some parts of Corus, those exhibiting Talent are killed outright). If you enjoy Modesitt's work--this is a definite must-read. Modesitt has promised future books set in this world, and I await them eagerly.	2003-08-29

There's a lot of intriguing ideas jammed in here.<br />Unfortunately, all those ideas, in a book this short, mean that a lot of characters get short shrift. Likewise, the book isn't long enough to stand on its own; why certain characters behave the way they do doesn't really make sense unless you've read the previous two books. Thus, the series ends leaving a lot of questions (not the least of which is why the book is written in the present tense when, and only when, Matt Cairns is the viewpoint character).<br />All in all, though, if you've read the first two books, you'll probably want to read this one just to see how it ends. If you haven't, start with &quot;Cosmonaut Keep&quot; and &quot;Dark Light&quot; before reading this one.	2003-08-16
US	50237292	R3BVOXDV0PPJLG	0312981260	559539342	Temple	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A book that will blow you away . . .	. . . and maybe leave you scratching your head, too.<br />On the up side, this book has some of the most inventive action scenes I've come across in any book I've ever read. Granted, some of them depend on ridiculously close timing (e.g., a helicopter blade just happening to move into a certain position at a certain moment), but this is escapist fiction in the Indiana Jones mold (it has the humor, the romance, and even a whip or two). There's a lot of suspense, and you don't know until the very end what's going to happen--except, perhaps, that lots of guns will be fired, and lots of people are going to end up as cannon fodder.<br />On the down side, in some cases, Reilly erred by trying to explain things that might have been better left alone, in the process making statements that are just jarringly inaccurate. In particular, almost any time the characters speak of thyrium, the mysterious material that propels the book's plot, they say something that flies in the face of scientific knowledge. I also have to commend Reilly for attempting to throw in a math lesson of sorts, but it doesn't help his cause that the math doesn't quite agree with the rest of the story.<br />These quibbles aside, though, Temple was still a riotous good time.	2002-07-28

Gerrold does an excellent job of depicting a world just barely surviving a series of plagues, only to be beset by attacks from the Chtorrans (think large pink worms that think *you're* lunch).<br />Jim McCarthy is an excellent protagonist, and he clearly develops over the course of the novel--while surviving numerous life-threatening encounters with the Chtorrans--becoming, to quote Coleridge, &quot;a sadder and a wiser man&quot; by the end.<br />The book did remind me of Heinlein's ~Starship Troopers~, although I think this book is an order of magnitude better: almost everything that happens in Gerrold's book is, if not likely, at least plausible. [The one notable exception would be the fate of Jim's friend Ted; I didn't quite understand the motivation for his actions late in the book.] In particular, the flashbacks and sidebars seem particularly well-placed and don't disrupt the narrative. [There are questions raised that aren't answered, but as there are six more books in the series (three of those not yet published), I suspect many of those questions will be answered later.]<br />Gerrold wrote this as the first book in a series of seven (so far, four have come out; fans have been waiting a decade for the fifth), and they're all out of print. Gerrold has said there are plans to bring the first four books back when the fifth comes out; I, and many others, eagerly await their re-release.	2002-06-25
US	50237292	RBQO9NU2ME4VA	0765303558	769723156	Kiln People (The Kiln Books)	Books	5	11	13	N	N	Outstanding speculative fiction--and humorous too	At the World SF Society convention in Philadelphia last year, Brin read the first chapter of &quot;Kiln People.&quot; I immediately knew that I would have to read it as soon as I could. And it was definitely worth the wait (and, BTW--it's 470 pages or so, not 336).<br />Brin's basic premise is that most people in society now have a way to mass-produce temporary &quot;golems&quot;--clay copies of themselves--that can function independently of their creators, and then fall apart after 24 hours; if they choose, the creators can download the golems' memories into their own brains. [So, for example, you could go to college, work a job, and go on vacation at the same time.]<br />Rather than explain the plot of the book (which is explained above), let me simply say that Brin did an amazing job with fleshing out the world in which &quot;Kiln People&quot; takes place. It is fairly clear that it's a world where golem technology has been accepted; just seeing his ideas of how humans would adapt to such a world makes the book worth reading. And, thankfully, he keeps the tone fairly light: there are just enough puns and jokes to keep a smile on your face, but not enough that the book verges on parody.<br />And while I have to admit that the ending does border, as some other reviewers have pointed out, on deus ex machina (as it does in &quot;Earth&quot;), it seemed like he laid the foundation for it over the course of the novel, so it doesn't come as a shock.<br />IMO, this is the best Brin book I've read (I haven't  reached the Uplift trilogy yet, though), and I would highly recommend it to anyone, even people who don't normally read SF.	2002-04-22
US	50237292	R1FVDUEJRI1QKP	034543076X	138364901	Manifold: Time	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Excellent start to a &quot;hard&quot; SF trilogy	The tantamount question of &quot;Manifold: Time&quot;--and, in fact, the entire series--is known as &quot;Fermi's paradox&quot;--if there is intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe, why haven't we found it yet? [This question is tackled further in the remaining books of the series, &quot;Space&quot; and &quot;Origin&quot;.]<br />Setting the plot in motion is Cornelius Taine, who presents to ex-astronaut Reid Malenfant the (real) &quot;Carter catastrophe&quot;--the idea that humanity is likely to go extinct in the &quot;near future&quot; (200 years), *even if mankind colonizes space.* At first, Taine convinces Malenfant that it may be up to Malenfant to save the human race from the Carter catastrophe, and that salvation may come from a message that points to Cruithne, a satellite sharing Earth's orbit. But, as the plot progresses, Malenfant begins to question why he was brought to Cruithne.<br />[I had the chance to speak to Baxter about the Carter hypothesis at a recent SF convention. He finds it intriguing, although he has his doubts, especially regarding Carter's analogy (a box with one special ball out of either 10 balls or 1000). In part, the &quot;e-mail&quot; containing ways to refute the Carter catastrophe represents his own doubts.]<br />Moreover, Baxter intertwines this plot with the rise (and fall) of the &quot;Blues,&quot; a group of preternaturally gifted children. In the end, Baxter provides a possible answer to Fermi's paradox--and it is an extremely startling one.<br />If you look carefully, there *is* one medium-sized plot hole with the final part of the book, although it isn't immediately obvious (in fact, it was only on a second reading that I caught it myself). That gaffe aside, this book is a thought-provoking, challenging work, and I look forward eagerly to finishing the trilogy.<br />Additional recommendations: I would recommend this book to fans of &quot;Earth&quot; by David Brin and &quot;Mother of Storms&quot; by John Barnes, and vice versa.sa.	2001-09-05
US	50237292	R33IX3NB4FQCI0	042517736X	459587507	Abduction	Books	1	2	2	N	N	Skip this one, please....	Like most of the reviewers, I bought this one largely because of Robin Cook's name (I really enjoyed \\"Chromosome 6\\", for example). Apparently, this is the first time this book has been in print; after reading it, I can see why.<br />The book starts off with a great premise, and has some good action scenes. But almost immediately it begins falling apart at the seams: the Interterra culture is wildly implausible; many of the events seem contrived and dictated by the plot (e.g., a rather abrupt change in motives in one of the 'lost' characters); there is no character development whatsoever; and, to quote another reviewer, there is rampant--and seemingly unnecessary--homophobia. Worst of all, the final \\"surprise\\" event of the novel--to say that this novel has an actual ending is giving it far too much credit--is telegraphed long before it comes (&agrave; la Michael Crichton's ~Timeline~).<br />If you want to read it, save your money and borrow it. Better still, save your time too, and don't bother. [Find one of Cook's more recent, and significantly better, efforts.]	2001-06-02
US	50237292	R3R4MTOWMJNTR3	0440234743	934400771	The Testament	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Decent &quot;adventure&quot;, but . . .	While the book was well-written, and there are certainly some exciting sequences, the book never really arrives anywhere.<br />Phelan's heirs don't come across so much &quot;evil&quot; as they do as victims of circumstances (a man who, rather than give his children care and love, just gave them $5 million each when they turn 21; he then took pleasure in seeing them waste it). Rather than making the children the villains, they become (not quite) innocent victims--robbing the book of much of the conflict one might expect.<br />Moreover, the last 100 pages peter to a close, without any real sense of urgency or drama.<br />I read--and enjoyed--&quot;The Pelican Brief.&quot; Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about &quot;The Testament.&quot;	2001-06-02
US	50237292	R1H4WNF7MUETL	0613032993	855829988	The Andromeda Strain	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Great build-up that runs off the rails	I read \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" about five years ago. The first 80-90% of the work was near perfect: absolutely brilliant writing, full of suspense, that I found almost literally hair-raising.<br />Unfortunately, it appears that somewhere along the way, Crichton boxed himself into a corner, and couldn't find a plausible way out. The net result is one of the most illogical endings I have ever read; the final 20 or 30 pages feel like they have nothing to do with what has gone before. [The problems begin when they find out exactly what the Andromeda Strain is--or, perhaps, more properly, what it *isn't*.]<br />While it is by no means a bad book, I was still much disappointed by the ending.	2001-05-15

Brin has chosen one of the toughest---&quot;What if I change some of the basic physical laws of nature?&quot; From that simple premise, he manages to spin an interesting yarn, that's well thought out, and quite entertaining; it is certainly one of the more humorous novels I've read this year.<br />My only complaint is that the ending seems somewhat rushed; it seems as if Brin knew where he wanted to go, and cut out a scene or two along the way to get there. Other than that, though, it was highly enjoyable.	2000-12-10
