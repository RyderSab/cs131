After eating at the Hopvine and enjoying the soups for quite some time, I was overjoyed when Michael Congdon brought many of those soups to us in the cookbook.  I got my copy in the first week it was available, and made my favorite - the Southwestern Pumpkin - shortly thereafter.  Delicious!  I've also made the wonderful Potato Leek and the White Bean with Caramelized Shallots and Rum.  A friend of mine purchased a copy of S.O.U.P.S. for me for Christmas, not knowing I already had one... but hey, it just meant that she now has a copy of her own.  :)  She and her guy made the Moroccan Lentil soup and loved it!  That's going to be what's in my pot next, too.  Michael, thank you so much for sharing your recipes with us!	2005-02-11

Nanna has shared with us the fruits of her cooking and research labors of many years - thank you so much!  This book is stuffed full of good information about Icelandic culture, the recipes explained in context and detailed well, that even those who've not been to Iceland can get a \\"taste\\" of the land.  Wonderful!	2005-01-05

The original, \\"cut\\" version is my preference in this classic Heinlein, rather than the re-issued version released after his death.  Some important concepts in the book are changed substantially with the addition of the originally-cut material, in my opinion.	2002-08-29

Continuing with the adventures of Mendoza, Kage Baker doesn't disappoint us with her motley cast of characters as they caper through time on their appointments for the Company.  I don't like to give away too much information in reviews, telling too much plotline... but if you liked the first or second of this series, I'm sure you'll like this one, too!  Lots of fun!	2001-11-14

Luckily, I didn't pay for this one - I got it as a freebie at a convention.  The storyline is convoluted and difficult to follow, and reads a bit like the main character was originally a favorite RPG hero and these are his escapades courtesty of a roleplaying weekend featuring a lot of delivered pizza and beer.  I haven't read any other Keith Laumer, but I'm glad that other reviewers of this book say he has better works!	2001-11-14

This hard-to-find volume of color photographs, many of which I believe were produced by the Regia Anglorum, are well worth the purchase price of this book - especially if you're a re-enactor.  You can see details quite well, and if you're wanting to make your own Norse crafts this is an excellent resource.  Don't pass it up!	2001-11-14

Yarrow was the first de Lint I read, several years ago, and it took me many years to find a copy of my own.  It is wonderful that it's being reprinted - that many more people who can share in the joy and magic of de Lint's world.<br />And magic it truly is.  When I read de Lint, I'm able to fully immerse myself in the story, the characters, the environment.  You can feel it stealing over you in a comfortable, magical way, encompassing you with the sights, sounds, and even smells of the places he takes you to.  When magic happens on the page, you feel the tingle of it in your hands.<br />As well as sharing his worlds, he also brings to us his music and his favorite books with us as well.  I've been introduced to other authors and music through his stories, stories and sounds which have become friends to me.<br />Thank you, Charles!	2001-11-14

I can't say that this work by Liz Williams held me riveted, and I have to admit that I occasionally felt it to be a bit stiff and uncomfortable - it was, however, true to the tone of the book overall.  The clash between cultures wasn't comfortable, so perhaps, neither was the reading of it.	2001-11-14
US	51013973	RT6NQVA0UMVL5	0425084752	362424107	Night of Power	Books	5	4	7	N	N	Insightful and thought provoking.	I recently re-read &quot;Night of Power&quot; - a few weeks after the tragedy of Sept. 11 in NYC.  I'd always felt the events in Spider's book to be insightful, but somehow... in the light of real life events, it was almost too painful to read.  But still, as with most of Spider's works, it ends with hope.  After it's all over, there's hope.  We need to keep working toward that end.	2001-11-14

Amy Thomson does a wonderful job of letting the reader discover the culture of the Tendu right alongside with the marooned Juna Saari.  This is a thoroughly entertaining book, and a light, easy read for a lazy Sunday afternoon.	2001-11-14
US	51013973	R8GZGM9EW93VA	0312876505	277498529	Svaha	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Older de Lint work, standing the test of time.	Before they began reprinting &quot;Svaha&quot; I managed to find a first printing copy in a used book store - yay!  This is one of his older publications, and I've found that some of de Lint's earlier works are a little more quirky, a little less formula than his newer ones.  In many ways, that's quite desireable, and I find &quot;Svaha&quot; to be a great read.	2001-11-14

I have an original print of this book (I really dislike the new cover they've reprinted it with!), and periodically re-read &quot;Telempath&quot; as it's one of my favorites.  One of the chapters is also in collections of short stories - &quot;God is an Iron&quot; - and is worth the price of the book alone.  This is a terrific book, folks!!	2001-11-14

The struggles between philosophy, science, court and religion play against each other in this wonderful historical fantasy by Vonda McIntyre, and the author comes out winning!  Set in the 17th century court of Louis XIV, you see the grandeur through the eyes of court newcomer Marie-Josphe.  While there is much description of the Sun King's court at Versailles - indeed, you're drawn into the sounds, sights, and smells - it's not overwhelming or confusing to the plot.  Buy, read, and enjoy!  (Make sure to check out other works of McIntyre's while you're at it!)	2001-11-14

After reading Doomsday Book, I loaned it to my mother (a devoted reader of mystery)... and never got it back.  A thoroughly engrossing read, you'll be wanting to take it with you wherever you go until it's finished!  You get caught up with the lives on both sides of time, and, indeed, at times it is harrowing.  I don't think that reading should always be comfortable, do you?  Especially if it means you're learning something about yourself and your views on others.	2001-11-14

This book wasn't interesting enough to keep me reading after the first (and I just checked where I left the bookmark) 23 pages, and, in fact, the writing style itself was stilted and uncomfortable.  Ick.  Sorry, Matthew Hughes, but this stuff isn't for me.	2001-11-14

As always, de Lint's work is full of magic, and &quot;Someplace to Be Flying&quot; is no exception.  His characters jump off the page to meet you, grab you by the hand, and take you along... if you're lucky, you'll soon be flying.  They'll show you things about the world, and yourself, that you never imagined could be true.	2001-11-14

I always enjoy learning new things, new viewpoints, when I read Charles de Lint's works.

This was the first Kage Baker I read, and I was happily surprised by the quality and enjoyability of the book.  Thoroughly engrossed, I took every opportunity of spare time I had to finish it, and wanted more!  The setting of 16th-century Spain was quite interesting, and the concept of rescuing genetic materials an engaging one.  Good job, Kage!	2001-11-14

One of the things de Lint does best is dealing with what happens when the everyday (ordinary) meets the magic (extraordinary).  In this case, the everyday is Ali, her mom, and Tony.  The magic is, of course, Mally, the village, and the mystery - the green man.  What happens next is pure de Lint magic.<br />This was the second de Lint book I read after I discovered him, the first being &quot;Yarrow&quot;, and it's still one of my favorites.  I come back to it again and again when I feel the need for a little magic in my life... something de Lint does extraordinarily well!	2001-11-14

I purchased this book a while back, read the first chapter, then promptly misplaced it.  A few months later, I did a lot of research into the Romany culture.  Then a couple of months ago, I found my copy again - joy!  I re-read the first chapter, now understanding more as I knew quite a bit more about Romany.  This is a more difficult read in some ways than other de Lint works, but worth the effort.  You can tell he did a lot of research, although I found some of the aspects of Rom culture he used to be a bit stereotypical - people who don't know about Rom probably wouldn't notice.  In the afterward he comments about the book having been written during a time when &quot;culture borrowing&quot; wasn't as politically incorrect as it is these days - and to those people who have a problem with a non-Rom writing a book incorporating the culture... hmmph!  I see nothing wrong with it in small doses, so don't worry about it, Charles!  Overall, an excellent read!	2001-11-14

I actually enjoyed this second volume more in some ways than the first, although both are excellent.  Amy continues to explore the differences and similaries between the Tendu and humans in a thoughtful and touching manner.  For those reviewers below who felt otherwise, I say: &quot;Hey, folks, lighten up.&quot;  Everybody has differences in the types of works they enjoy reading, and I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Through Alien Eyes.&quot;	2001-11-06

It doesn't have photos or illustrations, but then, if you think about it, our ancestors didn't have the benefit of such, either.  I think the book stands strong on its own, without them.
