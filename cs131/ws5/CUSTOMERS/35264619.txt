The minor characters had their own stories woven into it, giving examples of dating and relationships. This book had me cracking up, and then you felt sorry for Malcolm. My question is, did Ariel find love in her friend Chris? and Why the hell Simon forgive Cynthia?, [she] didn't deserve him.	2004-01-12

From the boring life to the sexcapades I was taking it all in. Loved it. I didn't think this was far-fetched because many people have multiple personalities. I was happy for Jonquinette for finding love, and Jude calmed it down. Everytime Jude seemed to appear she would have sex, I was wondering if Jon would have AIDS in the end, but she didn't.<BR>Jonquinette seeked help from Dr. Marcella Spencer, from Addicted. I was happy Zoe(from Addicted)only appeared a couple times in Nervous because her chapter is over.<BR>I can't wait for Zane's new book.	2003-12-06

It starts with a 15 year old girl that falls in love with a hustler named Desmond. That love stayed the same all through his incarceration. The money he lavished on her, she searched for in other men while he was gone. Every dude had a problem, and couldn't compare to Des. The fast lifestyle placed her in horrible situations. As she got older she matured with wisdom. Terrible events makes her paranoid, times even friends became snakes.

Dominic wounded everyone around his finger, and the was still under his spell after he died.
