I've become a fan of Douglas Preston from his work with Lincoln Child. This solo effort is especially satisfying to read because one of Doug's great talents is the ability to paint vivid images in your mind, of both people and places. I live in the Southwest and he has nailed his places. I actually followed much of the story via satellite images, using Google Earth.  Added to that, this story will suck you in and keep you guessing to the very end.  I had to give it five stars because not many authors can do that for me.	2005-10-02

I work in this field and found the book incomprehensible. Clearly some people find the codes very useful, but my one star reflects the books overall value. It is basically uneditied set of personal notes written in a highly esoteric manner. There appears to be no professional editing or formatting. I bought the book because the title makes it look like anyone can create an army of webbots after reading it. If you're not a gifted programmer with specialized knowledge in this field, forget it. I feel bad writing this because I know the author who is a truly fine and brillian person.	2005-01-24

He's only improved with experience.  He writes with a personable, non-techie style that's a bit like talking with a friend.  His approach using video lessons combined with reading the book is highly effective.  I thought I might only need to see the highly informative videos, but trust me, you'll want to read the book.  There is so much more, and I've been using photoshop for original art and photo editing for years.  Buy it, you'll be glad you did.	2005-01-24

Peter is a wonderful writer who captures both his characters and places in a way that puts you smack into the story and you want to know what's coming next. A Dangerous Remedy is a page turner wherin an ordinary man is pushed beyond rational limits and takes actions that will amazing and confound you and leave you wondering what you would have done in the same situation.

As author of &quot;Virtual Humans&quot; I'm always looking for good books that bring a higher level to face animation.  This is it.  Jason writes in an accessable style, good humor and the kind of authority you want in a book. Frankly most other books that cover this subject are pretty boring and the faces are ugly. Jason is a very talented pro who privides you with everything you need to create the best, most realistic facial animation in remarkably easy ways.  I recommend it highly to those of you who want to perfect your face animation techniques.  His approach is different and better than any other that I've seen.  I especially recommend this book to anyone who has purchased &quot;Virtual Humans&quot;<br />Peter Plantec	2004-06-23

I suspect the fellow who didn't think this book was worth his time was looking for something a little ligher.  This book is a page turner.  It has energy, depth, excitement and damn good drama.  As a Virtual Human Designer, I know this subject and Greg did his research. It's not really a question of &quot;If&quot; this kind of virtual human will arise, but &quot;when&quot;.  This book really entertains you while it makes you think and introduces a cutting edge vision of the future.	2004-06-09

Trust me this IS a 5 star. True I'm a Connelly fan, but I found this story to be a page turner, I got deeply emotionally involved.  This is classic Connelly and if you love Bosch you'll love this book.  It's also very important chapter in the Poet saga.  So buy this book with confidence.	2004-06-09

Keller.  He was an amazing man, with great patience for a fellow like myself.  I hadn't seen him for many years when this book first came out so he was pretty old when he wrote it.  But it is a brilliant piece of work.  It takes the premise that we need to stop educating our children to an average of 70% when indeed they can learn 100% given the proper motivation, presentation and time.  Children are not all of the same ability, so a school year should vary for them.  Brilliant kids might learn 100% of the standard curriculum in a month while less able children can learn the same in several months.  He proposes some ways of achieving this.  Having worked at the Institute for Behavioral Reseach with Fred, I know this to be true.  It even worked with very disturbed autistic children.  This book is still way ahead of our current methods of education.  We can all learn from it.	2003-12-24

They clearly have some personal emotional issues to work through and this is not the place.  I wouldn't count their evaluation very highly.  This little book is simpy packed with essential information on acting, specifically adapted for animators...I am an animator and have learned much from Ed Hooks. I particularly like Ed's friendly writing style. Hooks is known world wide for his excellent seminars and I've quoted him in my own books on similar subjects.  I think it is very poor form for a person to make a personal attack when we're supposed to be rating the book. I noticed that they didn't have the guts to leave their name. This book is a seriously excellent source of ideas, technique and the underlying reasons why these things work in animation.	2003-12-13

I particularly like the remarkably succesful and excellent Suspense series which produced nearly a thousand shows in it's long stretch on the air.  That's remarkable. Most of them are really scary and interesting and unexpected.  The story behind Suspense is a fascinating one. However this particular book could have been written in a more professional style.  It could have used a more interesting format and most of all it could have used some better writing. That said, I highly recommend it because it has information you just won't find anywere else and some of the backstage stories are fascinating.<br />-P	2003-08-26

This is quite a departure from his Book of Questions.  Greg knows all the players in the legitimate life extension game.  He heads a Biomedical company and was on faculty of UCLA Med SChool.  He knows what he's talking about when he says we will have germinal choice technology soon that will allow parents to customize their children. It's not just the amazing ideas that are here, but the way Greg discusses the impact of such technologies on every aspect of our children's future.  It's both an exciting and terrifying vision.

He's a great, if silly character on TV.  This book is written very much in Alton's personal style, which made it lots of fun to read...for a while.  About 3/4 through it I got bored. Really.  I can't put my finger on why, but it just lost steam.  As in his TV show Alton gives great advice and sometimes wacky but workable ideas like hooking a hair dryer up to your BBQ.  Buy it, you'll certainly get your money's worth and I'm actully looking forward to his next one...if I can ever finish this one.  Strange but true.<br />-P-	2003-08-26

I roast my own espresso and grind it with great care and pump it through a two group computer controlled professional Italian espresso machine. My wife thinks I'm obsessive about it. With that in mind, Perfect Cup provides a lot of excellent information that most people probably don't know, about how to make a great cup of coffee. It also talks about the characteristics of different kinds of coffee.  If A&P 8:00 is your cup of tea...coffee, you might not give a damn, but if you really are curious...interested, passionate about coffee, you will probably enjoy reading this book.	2003-08-26

I probably liked this especially well because I could visulize the whole thing, having spent my youth right about where the story unfolds.  I've worked in radio and John imbued the story with the &quot;feeling&quot; of a studio at the hight of the golden age. In fact I felt a lot of emotion while reading portions of it. Unlike another reviewer, I found the story had plenty of twists and turns and I enjoyed it to the end. Like Dunning, I was born in 1942, and that to lent a special quality to the book.  He researched that era and nailed as far as I can tell.	2003-02-06

Ray holds up well because he's a reasonable thinker.  Although some of his predicitions seem outlandish, they may not be.  You can't read this book without engaging in a lot of interesting visualization about the future.  Some of it is frightening, but there is hope as well.  Will the future runaway on it's own or will we be in charge?  I don't know, but I'm sure thinking about it, now.	2003-02-06

Susan is a gifed artist and her method takes the fear out of attempting what would otherwise be a terrifying project.  I like landscapes and her method lends itself beautifully.

The Age of Spiritual Machines is a unique, exciting and frightening look at what could be on the way....I'm not talking wild speculation. Ray has the inside track on what's happening. He's a true techno-cognoscente and he writes this stuff because he want's you to feel and think about where we are all headed. Machines smarter than us? There is little doubt about it, but what is that going to mean to you? Read the book. Ray doesn't need the money, trust me this book was a labor of love. Consequently it has a deep, meaningful texture that leaves you wondering long after you put it down.	2001-08-27

Buy it folks. My problem is that this is a very short book and could have been a lot shorter. There is considerably more redundancy than is necessary to get the points across. Otherwise, it's well written and illustrated, providing the insider information you need. However, in the espresso blending section David spends almost two pages avoiding telling you what coffees make good espresso blends. Sure it's subjective, but I guess I felt I was paying for his opinion (which he gives copiously on other espresso issues.) He alludes vaguely to Brazilian and low acid (Brazil has very a wide range of possibilities, only a few of which I think make good coffee of any sort) and that's about it. I'd hoped for more. But there can be no doubt that David knows espresso in every detail. He's spent a lot of time and effort collecting the unique and necessary information he imparts. Plus, he and I agree that the best espresso is made in northern Italy and that most US espresso is charcoal water. So, this is a very expensive book for it's length, but it's definitely worth the price if you want to really understand espresso.	2001-08-27

Cavelti must be a genius of some kind.  I see he's a banker and an expert on precious metals.  How then could he write such an amazingly insightful translation of Tuiavii's words.  Peter doesn't merely translate words (which would loose a lot of subtlety) he gets inside of the chief's mind and translates with wondrous empathy.  I feel like I know this great Chief and I really understand his point of view.  This is a serious book that is chock full of natural humor.  I read it in spurts during my busy day and it actually gave me a new perspective on who we are today.<br />I spent some time in the south pacific on an island populated only by natives.  I befriended one named TuWakki and he, much like Tuiavii, had a sharp, innocent wisdom about him. I found myself loosing interest in material things after only a week with TuWakki.  A month later I had lost all interest in returning to the harsh life of civilization.  So yes, Tuiavii's words ring true and clear and Peter Cavelti is a wonderful writer.  Buy this book even if you don't think it's for you...You'll love it. -P-	2001-03-06

The story, the  characters and the ending are exceptionally well crafted and unexpected.  I'm dyslexic and reading is difficult for me...but I tore through the book  in two days...for me a record.<br />I can't say much about it because I don't  want to ruin it for you, but the bad guy is remarkable...I love that, and  the good guys are complex.  The story is about the discovery of the world's  heaviest object -- a meteorite -- and trying to haul it from Chile, around  the Horn to New York without anybody knowing. There are problems, and  death.  The engineering is fascinating and these two writers paint visual  images like few others.
