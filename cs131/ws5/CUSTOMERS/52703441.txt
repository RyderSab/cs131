After re-reading \\"I Had A Hammer\\", I remember why it remains one of the best biographies/autobiographies that I have ever read.     <br /> <br />The sports genre in books is much harder than one would think to keep up interest in.  There are very few gems in any sporting subject; mostly it's very mediocre to terribly vapid.  Usually a fan becomes disappointed in their sports \\"heroes\\" when they read a biography about them, because the writing can be so bad.  Fortunately, for a ballplayer as great as Hank Aaron, the work lives up to the character and legend of the man. <br /> <br />Mr. Aaron does a splendid job of taking the reader through his life in Alabama, his discovering the game of baseball, and - of course - his remarkable career.  His writing style provides enough description to allow the reader to get a true mental \\"picture\\" of what his life was like without getting bogged down in minutiae.  Throughout the book, I had the feeling like I really was there watching his career unfold. <br /> <br />Of course, that brings us to the real core - and most important part - of his life story.  That is, what Mr. Aaron experienced as he neared and eclipsed Babe Ruth's home run record.  Most celebrities or sports figures would relate this in that sensational, \\"woe-is-me\\", tabloid-tell-all sort of way.  Not Mr. Aaron.  He shares many of the truly hateful and despicable letters he received from people across the nation who saw the idea of an African-American breaking the record of a white man as egregious.  Mr. Aaron relates how this inundation of hate mail affected him, but he manages to avoid expressing any hate towards the senders of those letters.  One obviously gets the sense that Mr. Aaron steeledhimself against those attacks with grace and dignity, allowing himself to still play the game the way it was supposed to be played, and to do it with class and personal enjoyment. <br /> <br />It is striking to return to Mr. Aaron's autobiography after the events in baseball over the past decade.  We as a fan base in general express outrage over the strike, the steroids (and questions about those players that broke records), outrageous salaries, and the like.  It seems to always elicit a response demanding a return to the \\"innocence\\" of baseball seasons and players gone by.  However, Mr. Aaron's experience demonstrates that there was controversy in almost every era of the game.  In his case, it was a despicable form of racial hatred expressed by a very vocal minority in this country. <br /> <br />Again, \\"I Had A Hammer\\" stands out as one of the great books in the sports genre, and stands out as one of my favorite biographies/autobiographies.  I rate it the full five stars, and encourage readers of all interests to give this one their attention.	2005-09-16
US	52703441	RPK9O3CCDIZPX	0060746890	865086794	Hunter Killer	Books	3	33	40	N	N	Not great, but not horrible - the mediocrity sets in	Patrick Robinson really started his fiction career with a bang with \\"Nimitz Class\\" and \\"Kilo Class\\".  Since then, he has seemed wildly erratic.  The quality of his output has evened out somewhat in the last three or four outings, into a pattern that is almost maddeningly mediocre.  As with most every one of his naval-themed novels, the plot summary seems that it should be wildly entertaining and at least partially plausible.  Mr. Robinson has delivered on that promise on a few occasions, and other times he has not.  \\"Hunter Killer\\" seems to have fallen into the latter category. <br /> <br />One hang-up in some of Mr. Robinson's earlier works is that he got bogged down in trivial detail; every meal and wine tasting that every character had was described down to the most minute detail, at the expense of the storyline.  Fortunately he curtailed these descriptions, though they pop up a few times throughout \\"Hunter Killer\\", and - despite the obvious fictional content - one can't help but wonder how naval officers can afford such extravagant feasts.  In reducing the gourmet play-by-plays, Mr. Robinson kept the story very tight.  However, that has led to another problem in the past several stories.  Where he has reduced that unnecessary detail, it seems that he has not adequately filled out certain components of the plot and storyline.  Everything seems to play out just a little too cleanly or awkwardly, or the action sequences are minimally detailed, while the discussions fill up three or four chapters. <br /> <br />In \\"Hunter Killer\\", this pattern holds.  So much is devoted to discussions about carrying out the operations, recruiting the participants, and so on.  Several chapters occupy the reader's time to these details.  But then the actual execution of the operations and the ensuing U.S. response occupies a very small percentage of the book.  The result, to this reader, is a lot of buildup to a resultant sequence that elicits a sigh in response.  There is also the continued annoyance of how Mr. Robinson keeps writing the escapes of the antagonist Ray Kernan; I had a hard time fathoming in \\"Hunter Killer\\" how he could walk up to a team of SEALs who have targeted him for years and still be able to slip away.  It is a somewhat lame way of trying to keep your foil for future novels. <br /> <br />The characters in Mr. Robinson's books - \\"Hunter Killer\\" included - also fail to ever do much for me.  I find the Jimmy Ramshawe character slightly annoying, and Arnold Morgan - for all his bluster and kick-ass attitude - pretty boorish and obnoxious.  That doesn't say much for the protagonists of your franchise.  Even in reading fiction as escapism, one can't help but wonder how these two would continue to run roughshod over the Washington political establishment and leaving the President completely impotent.  To his credit, though, Mr. Robinson did introduce a character with some potential in Jacques Gamoudi. He could be what John Clark was to Tom Clancy's franchise, but something tells me that this potential may not be tapped, or at least not fully exploited.            <br /> <br />One last pet peeve that shows up in \\"Hunter Killer\\"; that of the stabs at humor through overused lines that Mr. Robinson tries to pass off as funny.  He'll use it throughout the entire book, or take the \\"shock-and-awe\\" approach and use it dozens of times in the course of one or two chapters.  To cite one example from \\"Hunter Killer\\", he usues a line about Jackie Gleason doing a French accent at least four or five times in the course of twenty pages.  It wasn't very funny the first time, and got worse as the same line repeated itself in that short a space.  I don't mind humor, but it has to be funny, and the reader doesn't need to be repeatedly hit over the head with it.   <br /> <br />All those annoyances aside, \\"Hunter Killer\\" does have its interesting and somewhat entertaining moments.  It is clear that Mr. Robinson possesses a great deal of naval knowledge,and so the descriptions of the battles and naval operations are among the best in the fictional realm.  Again, though, it just raises the sense that there was a lot of unfulfilled potential.  Readers of this genre can do a lot worse than \\"Hunter Killer\\", but they should expect better.  In that regard, then, I rate it three stars to reflect the latest in a line of mediocrity that has found its way into Mr. Robinson's writing.    <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />	2005-07-30
US	52703441	R2QBDCMZW6FMWT	0312324251	313007122	Justice For None: A Novel	Books	5	17	18	N	N	An intriguing and stirring sophomore effort	In their first foray into the realm of fiction, Gene Hackman and Daniel Lenihan created &quot;Wake of the Perdido Star&quot;, a novel that I believed to be one of the best seafaring novels of recent memory.  It made me very eager for future efforts from this tandem.  While it has been several years, the wait was well worth it.  Their sophomore effort, &quot;Justice for None&quot;, is a dramatic departure from their first work, but is a very enjoyable read.<br />I was frankly quite surprised that Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan would release a novel that is of an entirely different subject and historical era from their first one.  It is something that, I believe, most authors have not pulled off well, and in doing so, have alienated much of their fan base.  However, Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan proved to be the exception to this pattern.<br />&quot;Justice for None&quot; is set in the small Illinois town of Vermilion on the eve of the Great Depression.  The story involves Boyd Calvin, a struggling World War I veteran who gets caught up in the murder of his estranged wife, which leads to a pair of runs from justice before a climactic trial to prove his innocence.  <br />The Boyd Calvin character is developed very well, and proves to be an interesting focal point for this story.  The authors created someone who elicits in the reader an internal conflict.  On the one hand, he is a sympathetic character as he struggles with his dark history in the war, the reconciliation with his wife, and his fight against a justice system in which the odds are wholly against him.  On the other, he is almost repulsive, as he consistently resists authority and pushes away those who are trying their hardest to help him.  This character development works very well, and is somewhat rare to find in these types of stories.  It holds your interest and keeps you locked into the plot. <br />The plot itself is also intriguing, though it is perhaps more of a part of a broader view of this pre-Depression, Midwest society.  It seems almost underdeveloped in some places, and was less of a driver in advancing the story.  Rather, it supplemented the character elements and external events, such as the impending stock market crash, race relations, and small town life.  While this would seemingly be a liability, Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan made it work.  The prose is descriptive yet sparse, which paints a very vivid picture, keeps the reader interested, and also serves to drive the plot at a rapid pace.  <br />I also give credit to Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan for the story development.  Novels like this usually have a pretty standard ending that the reader knows at the outset.  So, there is usually a &quot;surprise&quot; ending, which sometimes works but more often is picked up by the attentive reader well in advance.  In &quot;Justice for None&quot;, the authors somehow developed a storyline that was unexpected in terms of how the climactic moment would unfold.  Then on top of that, they advanced the story to a wholly satisfying conclusion that had an element of surprise that was also not anticipated.  What made the ending so good is that while it was a surprise, it was also rather subdued, which actually served to emphasize the impact even more.<br />So often in reviews - my own included - there is the tendency to rate something in comparison to the authors' previous work.  I tried very diligently to avoid doing so here, because of the stark difference between &quot;Justice for None&quot; and &quot;Wake of the Perdido Star&quot;.  If I were to rate this based on a comparison, I probably would rate this as 4 stars.  However, taken as a stand-alone novel - which is more fair and representative of the work - it does merit a rating of a full 5 stars.  <br />Once again, the work of Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan has apppealed to me as a reader, and I am once again looking forward to their next work.  Hopefully, it will not be as long a wait, but I am eager to find out what they come up with next.	2004-05-29
US	52703441	R5VNDJEVFSO2U	0446530689	792252776	The Protector (Morrell, David)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A return to strong storytelling by one of the best	For a period of several years, the novels of David Morrell could always be counted on for outstanding storytelling.  The plots were always fast-paced, intelligent, well-researched, and just plain fun.  But after the release of &quot;Extreme Denial&quot; in 1996, it seemed that he had lost his way.  The three books released after 1996 were progressively horrible, and I had begun to wonder if Mr. Morrell had lost his creative touch.  After giving him one last shot with &quot;The Protector&quot;, Mr. Morrell has delivered the goods, and it seems that his knack for great writing has been resurrected.<br />&quot;The Protector&quot; follows a former Delta Force soldier turned protective agent named Cavanaugh through a job that goes completely and spectacularly haywire.  Looking for answers, Cavanaugh pulls the reader along at a frantic pace, through multiple twists and turns, conspiracies upon conspiracies, right up through an unanticipated conclusion that is alternately satisfying and yet calls for more.<br />Mr. Morrell, like all great writers, drops enough plot threads and little details that almost go unnoticed as the reader races by.  But inevitably, they come up later in helping resolve the plot and provide multiple surprises.  Also, Mr. Morrell is very good at providing enough descriptive elements through his storytelling that don't leave the reader feeling cheated, but at the same time, do not interfere with the pacing of the story.  Both of these traits were not as finely tuned in his previous three efforts, but are well-used in &quot;The Protector&quot;.<br />What also made &quot;The Protector&quot; a great read was that the characters were intriguing and - for lack of a better word - likable.  The Cavanaugh character follows in the mold of those in his earlier classics; he is intelligent, determined, a bit world-weary, unassuming, but possessing the killer instincts to save his life and those closest to him.  &quot;The Protector&quot; is also served well by a strong foil in the Prescott character.  <br />If there were any criticisms with &quot;The Protector&quot;, they are relatively minor and pretty much constitute nitpicking.  The story angle involving the foreign agent seemed unfulfilled, in that it was never fully realized who was chasing Prescott.  It also seemed that there might have been more potential for the Rutherford character to be involved in the plot resolution, but instead, he is relegated to just popping up here and there throughout.  <br />All in all, &quot;The Protector&quot; was a very enjoyable read, and it was great to see Mr. Morrell back in fine form.  I would normally give this a five-star rating, but I am reserving my evaluation just in case this return to form is sustained, or just a one-shot reminder of how good he used to be.	2004-05-20
US	52703441	R1POVQ9P16XAW8	039915079X	700072898	The Teeth of the Tiger (Jack Ryan Novels)	Books	2	5	6	N	N	A marginal effort that seems to be setting up a sequel	I have been a fan of Tom Clancy for a good many years, but it has been increasingly more difficult to write favorable reviews of his recent efforts.  I was hoping for a chance to write a positive review for his latest effort, \\"Teeth of the Tiger\\", but unfortunately, I can do no better than submit a marginal one.<br />With the past few novels, it seems that Mr. Clancy is scrambling to keep a hold on his loyal readers by adapting to criticisms from those of us who brought them forward.  \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\" was a good story, except that it was far too long and was distasteful for the sudden proliferation of sexual references and innuendo not found in his earlier efforts.  So, with \\"Red Rabbit\\", he scaled back the length and removed the sexual references, but the story took too long to get going.  Now, in \\"Teeth of the Tiger\\", he shortens the book more, and surprisingly departs from Jack Ryan to focus on the \\"next generation\\".  <br />\\"Teeth of the Tiger\\" sets up with a promising premis - that of an \\"off the books\\", covert intelligence operation disguised as a financial institution.  Its mission is something that is wholly realistic and timely for actual, real-world situations regarding the war on terrorism.  Mr. Clancy even presents an intriguing character in the form of Gerry Hendley, a disgraced politician who is friends with Jack Ryan and is head of the firm which Ryan helped establish.  This is really where the positives of the book end.<br />The length of the book outwardly seemed to imply that Mr. Clancy would quickly set up the story, then kick the action into a furious, 200-page race at full throttle, which is one of his strong points.  However, he applies the same plodding set-up that has been a staple of his previous, lengthier works.  The result is that when the usual mad dash is supposed to occur, the story is still being set up, but due to page constraints, he sets off on an action sequence without tying up the various loose ends that he created.  Worse, Mr. Clancy omitted some necessary detail so that the reader could understand how they made the link to each of the terrorists being hunted down.  He spent so much effort getting to the killing of one terrorist, and suddenly they were killing other terrorists that were supposedly connected, yet there was no mention as to how they figured out who the target was.<br />The story also stopped abruptly, and left a big plot line hanging, as if to set the foundation for a sequel.  This is not entirely new to Mr. Clancy's books, but this one was far different.  In his previous novels, Mr. Clancy would leave a story thread out there that could be picked up in the next novel, but it wasn't necessarily so big that it demanded a follow-up.  So, essentially, he created novels that could stand alone on their own, yet if Mr. Clancy chose, there were minor things that he could pick up and run with.  In \\"Teeth of the Tiger\\", though, the dangling story thread was so large, and the way the story was so underdeveloped, it made me feel like this was the first part of a new \\"franchise\\".  <br />As noted, the character of Gerry Hendley was the most interesting to me, and that is another problem with the book.  Gerry Hendley is introduced fairly well, but then he is kicked back to near-obscurity for the majority of the story.  Instead, the focus is on Jack Ryan, Jr. - yes, Jack Ryan's son - and his cousins, the Caruso brothers.  None of these characters were very interesting.  Mr. Clancy didn't develop any of them all that well, and quite frankly, the three characters are so generic and bland that I didn't really care what they were doing.  I can understand if Mr. Clancy was trying to convey the point that these are young men, new to the \\"game\\", and learning the craft, but still...there is none of the magic, intrigue, diversity, and depth of character that he had with Jack Ryan, John Clark, and Ding Chavez.  Mr. Clancy is going to have problems if he intends to carry on with these threeas the future of his novels.<br />I honestly feel a little cheated out of a better story, and am a little upset that he so obviously set this up for a sequel.  I have never felt with one of his Jack Ryan novels that he was trying to milk the reader for more money, but in this case, he seemed to be doing so in that \\"if-you-want-to-find-out-what-happens-next, buy-my-next-novel\\" sort of way.  It is very disappointing.<br />I also wish that Mr. Clancy had stuck with Jack Ryan, Sr. as the focal point of his franchise.  There seemed to be some more room to \\"play\\" there as far as potential storylines, despite the age of his franchise character.  He also had some good room to play with his \\"Rainbow Six\\" crew, which was perhaps his last really good novel.  To ditch Jack Ryan for his son as an attempt to kowtow to his critics - who thought a \\"youth movement\\" was needed to resuscitate the novels - seems to be a foolhardy adventure.  If he doesn't think he has stories for Jack Ryan, Sr. or Rainbow Six, then he might be well-served to shut things down and focus his writing talents on other ventures (i.e., his nonfiction works).     <br />All in all, \\"Teeth of the Tiger\\" is marginal at best.  For those of you die-hard Tom Clancy fans that haven't yet read this, you would be well-served to avoid it.  It will only serve to disappoint you.  If you haven't already been questioning Mr. Clancy after the last few novels, you certainly will after this one, which is a pity.  He is a great writer, but he seems to have lost his way.	2003-09-15
US	52703441	R275LN5CFHYLHV	0385509510	418900469	Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith	Books	5	12	15	N	N	A fascinating look at extremist society in general	Mr. Krakauer has generated much pre-release hype for this book, which has indeed painted a rather unflattering - and unflinching - look at the more extremist side of the LDS Church.  However, I believe the more central theme of this book is showing that extremist behavior performed under the guise of religion is prevalent in all areas of our society - not just the LDS Church; hence the title \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\".  That is what makes the book so effective.<br />Is \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" a damning expose of LDS culture?  In some respects, it may be.  The plain fact is that the fundamentalists that Mr. Krakauer focuses on in this book are practicing some very important tenets of LDS faith that have never been fully disavowed by that church at large.  Further, the LDS Church has seemingly turned a blind eye to the fundamentalists, so in essence they are accepting of their ideals while publicly stating the opposite.  <br />The LDS Church became the focal point of Mr. Krakauer's book because - as he states consistently - it is a truly \\"American\\" religion, and one of the fastest growing religions in the world.  Also, it is these funadmentalists that have been the center of some large, unsettling news over recent years.  The fact that the LDS Church has never fully dealt with these fundamentalists is, in my mind, a good reason for Mr. Krakauer to delve into the church's history and attempt to find how its beliefs were twisted in such a horrible way.<br />As with his famous mountaineering books, Mr. Krakauer brings a great deal of objectivity into \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\".  A criticism in some reviews is that he never truly espouses his own opinion, but I think it is his journalistic objectivity and impartiality that strengthens the book.  The fundamentalists are a sick and twisted group, and while Mr. Krakauer does drop in a few subtle - if justifiable - criticisms, he is on balance very fair to both the fundamentalist and the LDS Church alike.<br />I alsoenjoyed the way he weaved the LDS history in with the recounting of fundamentalist society and the gruesome Lafferty murders.  LDS history is something not very well known if you are outside the faith, and it is refreshing to have an account as told from an \\"outsider\\".  I knew very little about the foundations of the LDS Church, and since I have no intentions of being a member, the book was enlightening in that regard.<br />Mr. Krakauer also has the keen ability, in his writing style, to pull the reader in, almost putting you right next to him in his interviews.  So, the emotional responses to the questionable and sickening practices of the fundamentalists were stronger.  It is this type of writing style that is outstanding - when done right - in nonfiction writing, and Mr. Krakauer is one of the best in that craft.<br />As I said, though, I think that the true point of \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" is that there are these extremist groups throughout society - not just in the LDS Church - that purport to be affiliated with religious organizations or faith in general.  Whether it be Christianity, Islam, or other faiths, these groups do exist, and are not doing God's work.  I think that Mr. Krakauer was trying to relay the point that although these extremists are not representative of the religion at large, they are frequently tied to that religion because of the hesitancy of that religion's leaders from completely disavowing them.  I think that Mr. Krakauer effectively demonstrated that although we tend to focus on Islamic extremists, there are extremists in our own backyards, too, and they should not be overlooked.<br />All in all, despite being in sharp contrast to his previous writings, Mr. Krakauer has crafted a very strong, powerful, and important book.  It is very timely in this era of renewed focus on religious extremism, and deserves to be read by a broad audience.  I would recommend it to all (adult) audiences of all faiths - LDS included.  It may not be flattering to the LDS Church, but in reality, it could be written about any religion.	2003-08-31
US	52703441	R3QL5XJJ52F2TQ	0765307154	81417598	The Last Jihad (Political Thrillers Series #1)	Books	4	24	25	N	N	A fresh, timely story makes for an admirable debut	With the U.S. and Iraq engaged in a showdown, and the possibility of a war that could see the horrific use of weapons of mass destruction, Joel Rosenberg writes \\"The Last Jihad\\", a thriller that none-too-subtly reminds the public what the price may be for not taking out Saddam Hussein.<br />For a debut in the world of fiction, Mr. Rosenberg has done admirably well.  He takes advantage of a plot that is made all the more timely by real-life current events, and has crafted a fast-paced, intriguing thriller.  The action starts off almost immediately, with an attempted attack on the presidential motorcade using a Gulfstream jet.  It doesn't take much time to finger Iraq as the perpetrator, and so events roll from there, as an Israeli commando operation reveals Iraq's nuclear capacity.  The Israelis give the U.S. one hour to take action before they fire a nuke on Iraq.  The story catapults the reader through diplomatic, military, and personal machinations that culminate in nuclear weapons being unleashed.  <br />The bulk of \\"The Last Jihad\\" focuses on the character of Jon Bennett, a well-to-do financial strategist-turned-presidential aide.  Not much time is spent fleshing out the character beyond his business career - serving to provide insight into the gas-oil deal that is brought into the story as a potential peace plan capstone between the Arabs and Israel.  This is a mixed blessing; while the lack of character background and development allows the reader (and author) to stay focused on the plot, the downside is that the reader doesn't care as much what happens to the character, in that the character remains distant.  So, in terms of the primal \\"rooting for the good guy\\", there is no impetus for wanting to root for the Jon Bennett character.  If Mr. Rosenberg intends to write other fiction, and, more importantly, wants to make Jon Bennett the literary second coming of Jack Ryan, he will need to improve upon this aspect of storytelling.<br />The character development -or lack of it - in regards to the President McPherson character in this story is interesting as well.  The reader probably learns more about him than the Jon Bennett character, and are exposed to more of the emotional rationales behind his actions in the nuclear politics he engages in.  I never could figure out if Mr. Rosenberg intended for President McPherson to be a Reagan-esque character in terms of determination and resolve.  To me, this character had a strong Nixonian trait about him that made him one not to particularly like one way or the other. <br />The bulk of the story revolves around the political and diplomatic happenings, demonstrating Mr. Rosenberg's obvious depth-of-knowledge and strength in this arena.  The military descriptions and story threads are less descriptive and very basic, perhaps showing that Mr. Rosenberg is not well-versed in this area.  It doesn't hurt him in terms of \\"The Last Jihad\\", but again, if he is to write follow-up books, he will need to expand upon his knowledge here.<br />As with any first-time author, there are a few threads in the story that - overtly or not - are left hanging.  There seemed to be a couple of little pieces here and there that could have been tied back in to the main plot, but weren't.  However, these were not omissions that took anything significant away from the overall quality of the story.<br />The main \\"agenda\\", if you will, that Mr. Rosenberg seems to be not-so-subtly pushing in this book is that of having to deal with Saddam Hussein at once.  One cannot help but ignore that he advocates removal of Hussein before he strikes out in some way at Israel, the U.S., or another ally.  This message becomes more evident as the plot unfolds.  As it pertains to current events in early 2003, this works just fine.  When the time comes that Saddam Hussein is removed from power - and when Iraq is not as large a focus on the national consciousness as it is now - this message may not play as well. <br />Readers withDemocrat/liberal leanings may pick up this book and be turned off by the rave reviews found on the jacket from the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Steve Forbes.  They may also be turned off somewhat by the obvious conservative bent in political discussions in the story.  But, if those readers are that hung up on politics, they would be well-served to avoid this book.  But for those who can set political leanings aside, this book will be well worth the time. <br />Outside of a few very minor glitches and the character aspects noted above, \\"The Last Jihad\\" is an outstanding debut for Mr. Rosenberg.  He has crafted a great story that has fantastic pacing, and takes the political thriller in an exciting new direction.  This reader hopes that he will write again.  <br />I give \\"The Last Jihad\\" four stars, and heartily recommend it all except those who are irritated by the reviews of conservative media figures and politicians, since they will not get past that and enjoy what is a very good story.	2003-01-05
US	52703441	R3BUO69N4DKAN0	B00006JO28	90165554	Lost Soldiers	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A gripping look at modern Vietnam via a mystery	James Webb has the notoriety of writing one of the best books about combat - certainly the best of the Vietnam War genre - in \\"Fields of Fire\\".  Now, in \\"Lost Soldiers\\", he returns the reader to that land nearly 30 years later.<br />Mr. Webb features the protagonist Brandon Condley, a world-weary man still wrestling with the demons of combat but a love for the country of Vietnam, as he tries to unravel the mystery behind an MIA's remains holding the dogtags of another soldier.  Condley's investigations branch out in several different subplots and assorted side stories, providing an expansive, multi-layered tale that quickly ties back together in a fast-paced conclusion.  The plot itself is rather ordinary as action-mystery tales go, though it does have some interesting twists and turns that only Mr. Webb can provide through the focus of the plot and the setting of the book.  <br />However, the plot really takes a backseat to the vivid descriptions of modern-day, post-war Vietnam.  While this is indeed a criticism of the overall work, this focus on the setting is surprisingly interesting and appealing.  Not much is written in any medium about the Vietnam of today, so getting a \\"look\\" through a piece of fiction is quite welcome.  Mr. Webb certainly knows of what he speaks, so there is no better to describe the utter poverty, the scars - psychological and otherwise - of war that won't heal, the growing infusion of capitalism, and the ominous grip of communism.  It is a fascinating, yet somehow troubling, mix that is all found on the streets of Saigon.  <br />All in all, \\"Lost Soldiers\\" is an enjoyable read among the fiction released over the past year.  Again, more could have been done with the plot, but being placed as a sidenote to the descriptions of modern-day Vietnam does not hurt the overall work as much as it would seem at the outset.  That being said, I must give it four stars out of five. <br />Also, a word of caution to those who are trying to compare this tothe outstanding \\"Fields of Fire\\".  Don't compare the two, because in trying to do so, one only comes away more disappointed by this book.  \\"Fields of Fire\\" and \\"Lost Soldiers\\" are two very distinct, separate works that draw on two completely different eras.  While \\"Lost Soldiers\\" is not of the same caliber as \\"Fields of Fire\\", Mr. Webb has bridged these eras very well, and has composed a good read.  But the two works should stand independently of one another.	2002-12-14
US	52703441	R17UJBDSTB3F5O	0743224329	586054008	Escape from Lucania: An Epic Story of Survival	Books	4	8	8	N	N	A little-known survival story comes to life	Perhaps in the dual wakes of the Shackleton phenomenon and the tragic events on Mount Everest in 1996, books in the survival/mountaineering genre have seen renewed popularity.  With the entry of &quot;Escape From Lucania&quot;, a little-known - yet epic - story of survival immediately shows it will be one of the top books of the genre.<br />Author David Roberts provides a written account - taken from extensive interviews - of two men and their quest to climb one of the highest North American peaks in what was then quite literally an unknown wilderness.  Mount Lucania had been attempted only once prior to this expedition, but its summit remained out of reach.  These two friends, both members of the Harvard Mountaineering Club, took on the risk of attaining Lucania's summit.  The climb, it turned out, was perhaps the most uneventful of the entire expedition. <br />Mr. Roberts somehow manages to pack a great deal of background information and detailing of the events into about 200 pages.  This was remarkable, considering this could have been the type of story to fill several hundred more pages.  He introduces the reader to the collection of characters: the two men who survived this trek, the two who were slated to climb with them but didn't due to problems at the base camp landing site, and the gruff bush pilot who flew the two men and their gear into the wilderness.  Mr. Roberts then dives into a recount of the harrowing attempts to get the bush plane freed from the glacial morass and airborne, the decision to travel as light as possible, the successful summit push, and then the amazing 100+ mile journey out to the nearest civilization.<br />In the course of this story, I found that the actual climb and descent from Lucania seemed to be the least difficult of their entire trip.  That in itself is stunning, since they traveled with very little in the way of cold-weather - much less climbing - gear.  I was left amazed that the bush pilot was able to take off from the glacier and return to Valdez, and was equally amazed at their decision to &quot;escape&quot; over such a long route that wound up being a treacherous trek with limited food and included fording of swollen rivers.<br />In terms of the modern mountaineering book, the natural comparison would be to works such as Jon Krakauer's &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;.  &quot;Escape From Lucania&quot; doesn't match up well with Mr. Krakauer's, mostly because of the stunningly tragic circumstances surrounding that story.  But &quot;Escape From Lucania&quot; is unique in that the people conquered uncharted territories and lived to tell about it.  This book is also well-served by the fact that in subject terms - in this case, Mount Lucania - it is virtually unheard of in most popular circles.  Most readers think immediately of the Himalayas and Alps when it comes to extraordinary mountaineering feats.  Mr. Roberts manages to remind us that there are, and have been, similar legends made in our own backyard.  <br />At times, Mr. Roberts seems to be trying to write for a more intellectually elite audience, which is a bit of a criticism I had with the book.  But overall, the book is well-written and a fascinating read.  It isn't the best of its genre, but it ranks among the best.  I give it four stars out of five, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fast-paced, exciting piece of non-fiction.	2002-12-12
US	52703441	R33TMB4HXA01CB	0060514558	921401083	Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism	Books	4	9	12	N	N	One of the better books in the crowded "talking head" genre	In writing \\"Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism\\", Sean Hannity has ventured down the same path of Rush Limbaugh, Ken Hamblin, et al, who created a popular talk radio and/or television show, then capitalize on the fan base by writing a book about the current political scene.  As with those that preceded him, Mr. Hannity is sure to have a bestseller on his hands, but it will be justified, as he has crafted one of the better works in the \\"talking head\\" genre. <br />A very definite theme in Mr. Hannity's book - and perhaps due to fortuitous timing - is the September 11 terror attacks.  A good portion of the book is devoted to, or can be tied to, that tragic day.  Mr. Hannity documents his feelings about the attack, and then opens the book with chapters citing numerous cases of liberal/Democratic influence on poor security and intelligence functions.  Through this, Mr. Hannity lays the groundwork to show how liberal thinking and policy has compromised our freedoms and security.  <br />Taking this argument further, Mr. Hannity then ventures into other political topics, such as taxes, abortion, and patriotic displays to further prove a liberal attack on our freedoms.  His documentation of quotes - taken from speeches, articles in the media, and even his own radio and Fox News Channel show - are plentiful and strong, damning evidence of how the liberal mindset works.  However, these citations are a double-edged sword.  In places, they are used appropriately in laying out his convincing arguments.  Other times, he tends to use it in what I can only describe as a style of an avalanche; he fires off so many citations and quotations that his ultimate point gets lost in the deluge.<br /> ... But more importantly, he portrays a nicer, kinder, \\"average guy\\" image that translates very well in his writing as it does over the airwaves.  ...<br />A larger issue to consider in review of this book is its long-range viability.  That is, how will Mr. Hannity's book stand up over the test of time?  In most cases of authors in the \\"talking head\\" genre, the books have a relatively short shelf-life.  To get a year of interest out of them is largely considered an overwhelming success.  But even with those successes, the lion's share of books in this genre quickly find themselves on the sale racks of bargain book outlet stores and even more rapidly disappear from the public mindset.  It may be too early to determine how viable Mr. Hannity's book will remain in the long-term, but I would tend to think it will be a success because it could remain popular for that one-year window.  Further, I think that, given its link to the September 11 attacks, it may be more viable and useful over a number of years as the debate and reflection continues on that important date in American history.<br />In whole, I give this book a four-star rating, and would recommend it to conservatives, moderates, and liberals alike.  It is not a preachy work, it doesn't \\"talk down\\" to the reader, and nor is it full of the egomania found in other books of the genre.  Mr. Hannity should be credited for authoring a work that stands above an otherwise crowded field.	2002-09-19
US	52703441	R26U4XGCVKVNXW	0399148701	17508097	Red Rabbit	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Interesting story concept, but mediocre by Clancy standards	As always, I eagerly await the latest Jack Ryan adventures, so I bought \\"Red Rabbit\\" the day it came out.  Good or bad, they have provided a fun reading diversion for a week or so.  And they are certainly better than the various franchise novels - written by other authors but which Tom Clancy sticks his name on for sales purposes - that I fortunately gave up very early in the game.<br />Mr. Clancy, I think, was taking an interesting gamble by making a prequel novel that wedges in between \\"Patriot Games\\" (I had forgotten it was also a prequel) and the classic \\"The Hunt For Red October\\". After all, his faithful readers have come to know just about everything there is to know about uber-hero Jack Ryan.  Given Mr. Clancy's penchant for alluding to details from previous books, the global view of the Ryan saga - for the time being - has the \\"Red Rabbit\\" chapter notably absent from his later works.  It will be interesting to see how Mr. Clancy will cover his tracks in future novels, but for the purpose of this review, this point is not all that important.<br />\\"Red Rabbit\\" does present an interesting story concept that is new to Mr. Clancy's formula: taking an real-life event (in this case, the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul) and writing a fictional story that leads up to and ultimately involves this event.  There has always been debate on whether Mr. Clancy is telling fictional stories of actual events, but if true, this is the first instance where the real event is so overt.  This concept alone made for a heightened level of anticipation as I started this book.<br />The standard Jack Ryan adventure is generally written in the same manner: several hundred pages of painstaking details that slowly weave the plot together - with a few high-tension incidents - followed by a quick-reading 100 to 200 page burst of action.  This pattern is no different here.  The only problem is, there's not much to really get excited about during the setup phase of the story.  There are no real small bursts of activity or action in the first 300-400 pages that really grab the reader and encourage you on.  I'm sure the purpose of the detail of setting up Zaitzev's escape from the Soviet Union was partly meant to demonstrate the tedious pattern one has to establish in order to make the getaway possible.  If so, he accomplished the task.  However, none of the related subplots provided any diversion; it seemed as though everyone around the intelligence community was on Valium.  The actual defection sequence also seemed just too easy by Mr. Clancy's - or any other genre author's - standards.<br />Also, part of Mr. Clancy's style is that while Jack Ryan is \\"the guy\\", the story is written almost like an ensemble piece.  So, we get the familiar faces in Ed and Mary Pat Foley, Admiral Greer, Bob Ritter, and others.  However, in \\"Red Rabbit\\", Jack Ryan seems to have the role of an extra with no speaking role.  He is just more or less \\"there\\" with no real purpose - and almost too far in the background - through the bulk of the story.  Even during the defection sequence he is just along for the ride (literally), and he doesn't get into any sort of entertaining or exciting action until the actual assassination attempt, which comes about 30 pages from the end of the book.  The associated British characters were all too bland as well.  It got to be that by the time I was two-thirds of the way through the book, I was waiting for John Clark to come in and save the day with some sort of bravado.  Alas, he's not in this story.<br />There were good elements to the book that are worth noting.  The description of the assassination attempt was an excellent sequence, and the conclusion was a nice tie-up to that part of the story.  I enjoyed the tie-in to a real-life event, as well as the reference - in the course of discovering what Zaitzev knew - to the real-life case of John Walker.  Also, I commend Mr. Clancy for avoiding the extreme overuse of sexual references andinnuendo that were such a distraction in his last book (\\"The Bear and the Dragon\\").  I am certainly no puritan, but I criticized him in my review of that book for that distraction.  It had never been a part of his other Jack Ryan adventures - at least not to that heightened degree.  So it was nice to see him return back to form.<br />All in all, \\"Red Rabbit\\" is a good story dragged down by being told rather tepidly and blandly.  So, I am rating it at three stars.  While there is much to criticize, there are enough good elements - some of which are noted above - to hold it from falling below three stars.<br />I find myself wondering if perhaps we as readers and reviewers are becoming too demanding and critical of Mr. Clancy's work.  But, I do think we are being fair, and in the end, this was \\"par\\" by his standards.  I wonder if perhaps he is finding himself at a crossroads of sorts as to where the Jack Ryan story goes from here.  It would certainly explain the decision to create a prequel, but one hopes Mr. Clancy can chart a course and return to a crackling, top-notch effort the next time Jack Ryan's tale hits the bookshelves.	2002-08-25
US	52703441	R263HRCC539L0Y	0812575393	139616359	Dead Hand	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Great plot potential, but poor and choppy in its delivery	Harold Coyle has had a very good reputation in the technothriller genre for creating some masterful stories. From &quot;Team Yankee&quot; to &quot;The Ten Thousand&quot; - and even the recent &quot;God's Children&quot; - he has displayed a knack for engaging tales that skillfully mix the raw emotion of the soldier in combat with the technical horrors of battle. He has written a few clunkers along the way, and sadly, &quot;Dead Hand&quot; is one of them.<br />I was very eager to read this book, because the plot synopsis seemed so intriguing. Political unrest in Russia, a rogue military leader possessing a nuclear arsenal, and gruesome operations in a post-apocalyptic countryside (courtesy of an asteroid); it all appeared to have the elements of a great story. But right from the start, the plot was spoiled by a choppy delivery. The pattern seemed to be a series of &quot;snapshots&quot;, or - more specifically - a bunch of unfinished short stories. Rather than setting up a story, or later folding into the main story, the reader felt that they were lurching from one soldier or unit to another, with no real cohesiveness or purpose. It felt to me that nothing was truly fleshed out or fully explained.<br />The result of this choppy delivery was that the main plot was moving along, and the reader was being dropped in at various points along the way to see what was going on, then yanked back out to be dropped into the story a little further along the way. I felt like I was missing pieces of the story, especially since there seemed to me to be several allusions to recent events that weren't included in the narration. The final, climatic battle scene - like the rest of the book - seemed to be rushed and not developed, and then ended abruptly, leaving us to come to our own conclusion about what happened. The book ended just a little over 300 pages, and seemed to be written as if Mr. Coyle had set a page limit and was trying to fit the plot inside of that.  <br />As with most who have reviewed this book previous to me, I noted several typos and minor technical errors that were unlike Mr. Coyle, suggesting he was rushed and a little less careful with his research.  Again, it seemed like he was trying to wedge a big story into a set page limit. <br />All in all, &quot;Dead Hand&quot; was a poor effort by Mr. Coyle.  I wish he - and/or his editors - had been a little more careful in putting this story together.  The story needed to be expanded to more fully take advantage of a unique and promising plot idea.  Instead, we received a choppy, incomplete work that left a lot to be desired.  I hope Mr. Coyle has taken extra care in his latest work, and in his future work.	2002-08-18
US	52703441	R2DT4AZMS6XA8H	031298250X	88732746	America: A Jake Grafton Novel (Jake Grafton Novels)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	One of the better Jake Grafton adventures	Stephen Coonts must be one of the most inconsistent technothriller authors writing today. He has produced one true classic in the genre - &quot;Flight Of The Intruder&quot; - and ever since, the ride for the reader is one of ups and downs. His track record has been to pen one or two so-so or outright bad novels, then get serious and fire off a gem. So, in between good reads such as &quot;The Red Horseman&quot; and &quot;The Intruders&quot;, we are also served clunkers such as &quot;Final Flight&quot; and &quot;Cuba&quot;. It has become such that a &quot;buyer beware&quot; tag should accompany every Coonts novel, just to be on the safe side.<br />Fortunately, after the debacle that was &quot;Cuba&quot; and the tepid &quot;Hong Kong&quot;, he got down to business and wrote &quot;America&quot;, which turned out to be a pretty darn good story. The plot that Mr. Coonts lays out - that of a hijacked, top-of-the-line sub and the havoc it wreaks on the Eastern Seaboard - is unique in this genre that has grown to be jammed with Tom Clancy-lookalike plots.<br />After a prologue that will eventually tie into the main plot, Mr. Coonts doesn't waste any time diving headlong into the action, leaping right into a gripping opening sequence in which the submarine &quot;America&quot; is hijacked. Enter hero Jake Grafton, tasked to find out who the bad guys are and to figure out a way to get the sub back. Grafton begins his sleuthing amidst the missile attacks, and deals with a Russian operative who may not be all he seems to be. The pages fly by as the plot unfolds, leaving the reader wondering how everything will tie up in what is sure to be a riveting conclusion.<br />Except that the conclusion sort of fizzles out. I would echo the sentiment of another reviewer in that the final 100 pages seemed to be written as if Mr. Coonts had run out of gas and was coasting the rest of the way home on vapors. Suddenly the pace slowed, and some of the side stories are mostly wrapped up in an all-too quick and &quot;tidy&quot; way as a means of falling into the solution of the main plotline. This is followed by the climatic confrontation with the bad guys, which is curiously set aboard a cruise ship and leads to a &quot;happily ever after&quot; sort of ending that seems all too clean and sterile, given the story that had led to this point. The cruise ship element felt way out of place, and only seemed to serve the purpose of making sure the characters of Callie, Toad, and Rita had some print space in this story where they were otherwise largely ignored (and not missed by this reader). <br />I wavered back and forth on rating this at three stars or four; it really could have gone either way. In the end, though, I gave &quot;America&quot; four stars because - conclusion aside - it was an entertaining book. Additionally, when evaluated with his other work, &quot;America&quot; was a far better effort by Mr. Coonts.<br />I can only hope that his next book is as good or better, but given his track record over the years, we'll have to wait and see. The good ones tend to be few and far between.	2002-08-09
US	52703441	R7YKFAC7BNUHX	0465057918	276025833	The Tsar's Last Armada	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A compelling look at a fateful voyage	Constantine Pleshakov provides a fascinating account of an event in history that has previously received short shrift in literary circles with &quot;The Tsar's Last Armada: The Epic Voyage to the Battle of Tsushima&quot;.<br />The focal point of this historical work is the Russian 2nd Fleet, and Admiral Rozhestvensky, who was appointed to lead this doomed expedition. The 2nd Fleet was dispatched from European ports by Tsar Nicholas II to defend the Russian Far East from the Japanese Navy, which had already destroyed Port Arthur and were threatening action elsewhere.<br />Mr. Pleshakov doesn't spare too much time in diverting his narrative, save for some background on the major &quot;players&quot; involved with the 2nd Fleet. He also spares little time to get bogged down in technical detail. I found this to be refreshing, because it meant staying focused on the voyage. It gave Mr. Pleshakov adequate room to give the reader a compelling account at the horrific living conditions for the sailors aboard a rag-tag collection of fine battleships, old and outdated warships, and other vessels that were barely seaworthy. All the while, these descriptions heighten the sense of awe and incredulity in the reader, given the realization that it was miraculous the 2nd Fleet was anywhere close to battle readiness when the fated encounter finally arrived. However, these passages read fairly slow, so it detracts somewhat from the story.<br />Whether intended or not, Mr. Pleshakov also manages to provide an interesting &quot;picture&quot; of the enigma that was Admiral Rozhestvensky. The reader learns of his desire to reach prominence, the unease and personal conflict as he was assigned by the Tsar to lead the 2nd Fleet, the adulterous disciplinarian who somehow kept the fleet together during the lengthy voyage, and the puzzling tactics along the way that damaged diplomatic relations and sealed the fleet's doom in battle. In essence, he was equal parts brilliant and flawed. Through thecourse of the book, you can sympathize with him, but then be amazed that he held the fleet together, then go back to sympathizing with him after the fleet's defeat and his wounding. <br />As the title would suggest, this book does not focus much on the battle itself, so many readers may find the description of Tsushima to be woefully inadequate. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more offered, but then again, given what the focus was, the battle description served its purpose well. <br />All in all, this is a good book to include in the collection of world naval history. The overwhelming theme of doom and tragedy that was the Battle of Tsushima permeates this book, which makes the work even more compelling when combined with the descriptions of the harsh turn-of-the-century life at sea. In the bigger scope of Russian history, this book is worthwhile in that it provides some insight into an event that contributed to the downfall of the Russian royal family. <br />I would recommend this to those who enjoy naval or military history, and to those who read Russian/Soviet history. I give it a four-star rating not for the content as much as for the fact that at a shade over 330 pages, and with a fairly limited focus, the book reads pretty slow.	2002-08-08
US	52703441	R27UR65B7LOYXX	0399147837	991985349	Shadow Warriors: Inside the Special Forces (Study in Command)	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Partly interesting, covers too much at expense of co-author	Tom Clancy has written enough nonfiction material now that the observant reader will know a) that he writes fiction and nonfiction, and b) how to distinguish between them (mostly in reading the dust jacket!). \\"Shadow Warriors\\" is the latest foray into the nonfiction realm, but sadly, a potentially great topic seems wasted away.<br />In many of his nonfiction works, Mr. Clancy collaborates with a military figure. \\"Shadow Warriors\\" is no different; the contributor is Special Forces veteran Gen. Carl Stiner. However, in such projects, the story of a major military event or segment of the armed forces (i.e., armor, air) is woven around the co-author, usually with the end result of portraying the co-author in a very favorable light. Sadly, though, Gen. Stiner's career is never afforded the same treatment. Whereas Gen. Chuck Horner in \\"Every Man A Tiger\\" or Gen. Fred Franks in \\"Into The Storm\\" get a hero's portrayal, Gen. Stiner winds up as almost a footnote here.<br />The primary reason for this occurring is, I believe, that \\"Shadow Warriors\\" tries to paint too broad a brush in terms of scope and history. \\"Every Man A Tiger\\" and \\"Into The Storm\\" focus on a singular event - in both cases Desert Storm. Here, Mr. Clancy and Gen. Stiner attempt to cover 50 or 60 years of history in a shade over 500 pages. While a history of the U.S. Special Forces would be a tremendous and valuable work, this book comes off as neither. I will acknowledge that there are many operations, training evolutions, and tactics that were classified - and should remain so - but there is certainly enough unclassified material available that would make a history of covert operations more engaging and worthwhile. \\"Shadow Warriors\\" completely glosses over the Vietnam War, where the modern special operations truly cut its teeth and had some of its most spectacular successes and deeds of heroism. This was the prime example of Mr. Clancy doing a disservice to those warriors; it was short shrift by watering down their exploits to a chapter of a meaningless, antiseptic overview that was almost a chore to read.<br />Also contributing to Gen. Stiner's heroic portrayal getting lost is the fact that the first half of the book keeps including huge passages - normally reserved for Clancy's collaborator - to individuals who aren't the focal point of the story. Special Forces legend Gen. Bill Yarborough occupies, by my estimate, the attention and writing space in the first third of the book. Gen. Stiner gets to relate his experiences in his training in between - which was actually one of the more interesting portions of this book - but it gets lost amongst all the references to and by Gen. Yarborough. I found myself constantly double-checking the cover and title pages to verify exactly who was the co-author with Mr. Clancy.  <br />There are some interesting pieces in \\"Shadow Warriors\\". One was the aforementioned descriptions from Gen. Stiner of his training. The segements on the Achille Lauro event were intriguing, mostly because there hasn't been too much detailed in other works of the behind-the-scenes work in this operation. The chapter on the Panama operation was also mildly intriguing. Unfortunately these pieces are scattered too few and far between to keep the reader engaged. <br />All in all, \\"Shadow Warriors\\" turned out to be a disappointment. Gen. Stiner deserved much better in his partnership with Mr. Clancy, based on the favorable portrayals of Mr. Clancy's previous collaborators. The U.S. Special Forces deserved better in terms of treatment and relation of its laudable history. The reader deserved better in terms of product from Tom Clancy. <br />If nothing else, this also gives more credence to my opinion that Mr. Clancy is better served in terms of quality and reputation to write his works by himself. The fiction works (\\"Op Center\\" and its numerous offspring) have lost him credibility in the \\"franchising\\" of his name to allow others to write for him. The nonfictionworks have been erratic, depending on who he is working with. <br />I give this book a two-star rating because there are some interesting pieces to take away after reading it. But those who have been considering reading this book are encouraged to look elsewhere. This reader will stick to reading Mr. Clancy's Jack Ryan novels...that is, until he starts co-writing those, too.	2002-04-07
US	52703441	R2MEOQ7DLBX2TP	0671000756	641705705	Detachment Bravo (Rogue Warrior #10)	Books	2	18	21	N	N	Predictable and poorly developed...the worst of the series	Let's get one thing straight right out of the chute: the \\"Rogue Warrior\\" series of novels aren't going to be winning Pulitzers anytime soon. These are pure, testosterone-driven, profanity-laced, escapes from reality; they have been a collection of books that have been fun to read. However, after reading \\"Rogue Warrior: Detachment Bravo\\", I have come to the conclusion that it may be time for Richard Marcinko to retire to his Rogue Manor.<br />For starters, the most obvious criticism of \\"Detachment Bravo\\" is its utter predictability. It is a trend that started several novels ago and gets worse with each successive book. Heck, even someone who has only read one or two of his books could guess the action and plot. You can ALWAYS guarantee one or more sequences where Mr. Marcinko loses his weapon or runs out of ammo and has to grapple in hand-to-hand combat with a bad guy, will go personally greet and smack around the chief villain in the story, will go meet and smack around his superiors, and - in the climatic battle at the end of the story - will lose his weapon or ammo and kill the villain in a prolonged hand-to-hand combat sequence. Honest to goodness: for a guy who preaches perfection and team support, he is always goofing up, and his teammates - who are there to back him - are never around to shoot the bad guy he's wrestling. Again, I know it's fiction, but it really starts to grate on a reader after a while. <br />The second criticism is that the plot in \\"Detachment Bravo\\" was poor. This series has never been too much about a plot, but he has done better. This one was not well thought-out, seemed disjointed in a lot of places, and was simply poorly developed. Yes, the reader knows who the bad guy(s) are, but it is never fully certain what their ultimate aim is or - more importantly - what they're doing other than trotting the globe on a yacht. What the reader is left with are the usual Rogue Warrior cliches found in every one of his books and the aforementioned predictability.<br />Readers who want to get Richard Marcinko at his very best should read his first two books: the nonfiction \\"Rogue Warrior\\" and the first fiction book \\"Rogue Warrior II: Red Cell\\". They launched him to stardom, but he never really held this high level, slowly tapering off until a precipitous decline in quality of his last couple of novels. I rate the book with two stars; it could have easily been a one-star review, but he still wins points for sheer escapism in his writing. <br />As I indicated at the outset, it may be time for Mr. Marcinko to put the \\"Rogue Warrior\\" series out to stud. If he decides to continue the series, this reader hopes that he will take a year or two off and develop a better story. Otherwise, I'm not wasting my money.	2002-04-05
US	52703441	RSYFEVA99WDK4	0684873745	77248244	Unguarded: My Forty Years Surviving in the NBA	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A classy memoir from a classy individual	I was drawn to &quot;Unguarded&quot; primarily because I grew up with the Sonics coached by Lenny Wilkens. I remember the championship season he guided the team to, and have always rued the day he left the Sonics for other coaching endeavors. <br />This book isn't verbose, and doesn't go into tremendous detail about every aspect of his career, but this style works for Mr. Wilkens. What the reader gets is a nice, classy snapshot of a career that has - as player and coach - encompassed the rise and current decline of the NBA. <br />I was particularly fascinated with his descriptions of the NBA he played in during the 1960's. The murky arenas, low pay, poor treatment of players in general, the caste system between rookies and veterans, and subtle bigotry were all things Mr. Wilkens highlighted. Most NBA fans would no doubt imagine the league as always being the &quot;showtime&quot;, glamorous atmosphere of the Magic-Bird-Jordan era. Mr. Wilkens' description would probably be as surprising to the hard-core fan as it would be to the non-fan. <br />I also found his opinions on the current state of the game to be fascinating. He laments the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; style of play where everyone's playing for highlight reel material, the &quot;me-first&quot; attitude among players, and the general loss of the art of the game he played. These are all things that have prompted me to quit watching NBA basketball in recent years, so I couldn't help but say a quiet &quot;amen&quot; as I read the book. <br />One of the troublesome areas I found with the book were when he addressed the topic of racism. In the very first chapter he tackles it head-on, saying that he saw it and experienced it, but then alluding that he doesn't dwell on it or hold grudges. However, when it arises in later chapters - notably in his being left off the Olympic team as a player or when up for coaching the original &quot;Dream Team&quot; - Mr. Wilkens comes off as definitely holding grudges and letting racism play a big factor in his life. It is a paradox I couldn't grapple with personally. I certainly don't deny he was treated horribly in situations based on his race, but I found that it was almost as if he was trying too hard to walk the tightrope between being bitter and handling the issue with class. It was an area of the book that just didn't work, because you couldn't tell whether he had indeed let it go or was still holding grudges on many an situation. <br />All in all, though, this was a nice memoir. There is nothing scandalous revealed, and he doesn't attack anyone - even in his descriptions of the aforementioned racial treatment or in his criticism of the modern game. Perhaps this also accounts for the puzzling, clumsy way he addresses racism, because while he does criticize a few, he writes very well of those who fired him or cut him over the years. <br />There is no doubt Mr. Wilkens has led an extraordinary career, and has done so with dignity, modesty, and class. We get our best glimpse of this tremendous man with this book, and I recommend it to fans and non-fans of basketball. The fan will be interested in the history of the game; the non-fan will see that there are still a few class individuals in an otherwise horrendous NBA. Mr. Wilkens has penned a nice book here, and it further confers upon him the status that Seattle and the Northwest is STILL &quot;Lenny's Country&quot;.	2002-01-21

Some of the actions he personally took part in or that took place under his watch are the acts of a traitor; however, many of these activities were covered up in the turmoil of his many scandals and a press willing to cover up for &quot;their&quot; man in office. If not for the reporting of Bill Gertz in the Washington Times, none of these activites would have ever come to light. <br />Mr. Gertz compiled much of the information he gathered for his works and put them together for &quot;Betrayal&quot;, a very readable and eye-opening look at the undermining of our national security. Here we get accounts, backed up by official documentation, of - among other things - Clinton's sell-out to the Chinese Communists, the smoke-and-mirrors policy he undertook with North Korea's nuclear program, and his efforts to keep Boris Yeltsin in office at the expense of our defense programs. The information is incredible, and quite frightening. He has allowed missile programs in China, North Korea, Iraq, and other rogue states to advance in quantum leaps, while allowing the U.S. to almost backpedal in its defensive readiness and national security arenas. He allowed the Russians to continue to stockpile their nuclear missiles while de-targeting and destroying our stockpiles. It confirms that the Clinton legacy is one of putting the United States at far more dangerous risks now and well into the future.<br />For the reader who does not follow news - or, more specifically, military and national security news - this will be a shocking introduction to what really happened during the Clinton administration. However, for readers like me who read Mr. Gertz's articles in the Washington Times frequently, and who stay abreast of national security affairs, there is really nothing new presented here - outside of the appendix,which included his supporting documentation. The book really seemed to me to be nothing more than a re-hash of his articles. This was somewhat disappointing, and led to my decision to rate this with only three stars.<br />I am certainly glad that Mr. Gertz has published this book, because it will lead to getting this vital information to a broader audience than his Washington Times articles might. I give him all the kudos in the world for doing so, and I encourage all those readers who don't follow this news to buy this book despite my rating. However, if you are up-to-date on this information, as I was, I would suggest not investing your dollars in this, since you will likely come away with a sense of disappointment.	2002-01-06
US	52703441	R8W6EW1TC9XXP	0679447326	389174636	Chesty: The Story of Lieutenant General Lewis B. Puller, USMC	Books	4	65	67	N	N	A thorough look at a Marine legend	Chesty Puller is one of the most revered warriors in U.S. military history, and it was surprising that until the publication of this biography, there was scant few books on this legend - outside of a slightly exaggerated biography published shortly after his forced retirement from the Corps.<br />Lt. Col. Hoffman presents a thorough, if slightly dry, narrative of the life of Lewis B. Puller. Expecting a slight bias from the author - a Marine himself - I found the biography largely free of bias and very fair. Every facet of Chesty's immense personality, whether it be good or bad, is given equal footing throughout. Also, Lt. Col. Hoffman avoided the trap of basing his biography on the numerous myths that surround Chesty's life. <br />I found the second half of the book to be most interesting. While Chesty's early life and Marine career - including his stints in Haiti, Nicaragua, and China - are worthwhile in establishing his warrior spirit and forging the man, there is not much depth in these topics. I presume this is due to lack of documented information more than any omissions by the author, but it does make for a slightly tedious first half of the biography. Once the narrative begins touching on Chesty's exploits in World War II, Korea, and post-Marine life, the full measure of the man is revealed, and more relevant information is presented. It is here that the &quot;meat&quot; of his life exists, and we get a good picture of how he was equally lauded and criticized for his tactical strategies, personality, and opinions of the military establishment. <br />Also, we get a partial, yet satisfying, glimpse of his interaction with his son, who would later become famous with his book &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;. While some reviewers have criticized the author for omitting Lewis Puller, Jr.'s suicide several years ago, I believe that this tangent would only serve to be off-topic and out-of-place in a biography of a man who died in the early 1970's. The interaction of father and son following the son's gruesome wounds in Vietnam are enough of a glimpse - and a powerful one at that - to satisfy most readers.<br />I would highly recommend this book in favor of &quot;Marine!&quot;, because it is far more in-depth, fair, and accurate. Lt. Col. Hoffman has done an excellent job with this biography. The only thing that prevents me from rating a full five stars is that the narrative is slightly dry and that the first half of the book is a little slow. As such, the casual reader may find it difficult to plow through the whole book.	2001-12-20
US	52703441	RXDJEC1YYULFA	0664224199	999679637	The Gospel According to The Simpsons:  The Spiritual Life of the World's Most Animated Family	Books	4	12	12	N	N	A reverent look at an irreverant show	One of my favorite TV shows these days is &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, which is arguably the funniest thing on the air. People who give the show a cursory glance always seem to think it lowbrow and crude, but as any fan of the show will tell you, it is intelligently funny, and if you peel back the intricate layers, you will ultimately find a moralistic foundation. As such, I was drawn to &quot;The Gospel According To The Simpsons&quot;, which proposed an interesting thesis for the show's quality: that of strong religious roots, and that the show portrays religion in a very positive light.<br />Mr. Pinsky begins his book by relating his way of coming to watch the show. He fell into the category of people who found the show crude, but never sat long enough to dissect it. Finally he came around, and recognized that a case could be made for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; to be the most religiously-based show on television today.<br />Each chapter tackles a specific topic - primarily the individual characters in the show. Mr. Pinsky develops a very strong character profile, showing how each character can be related to people we run across in real-life - or even who we may be in real-life. In doing so, he tackles the religious complexities of each character, and weaves this into his broader thesis. He shows that despite Homer's numerous flaws, he does have Christian beliefs, suggesting he is like a person who believes in God, but doesn't grasp it firmly - using his belief when it serves him. Ned Flanders is described as a cariacture of the born-again or evangelical Christian.<br />Throughout the chapters, Mr. Pinsky highlights many episodes in which religion - or a religious moral - was very much at the forefront. Again, he uses these examples to bolster his main thesis. These episode descriptions do become somewhat repetitive, if only because he focuses on three or four and relates the same description over and over again. This becomes a minor drawback in reading this book, because you wind up feeling like you are re-hashing the same material over and over again.<br />All in all, however, Mr. Pinsky does lay out a very provocative and convincing argument that religion is positively portrayed in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and that the show is one of the most religiously-based shows on television. It is a fun read for fans, providing a nice new angle on the show. For the skeptics, it may be compelling enough to at least give the show more than a passing glance.cause you wind up feeling like you are re-hashing the same material over and over again. <br />All in all, however, Mr. Pinsky does lay out a very provocative and convincing argument that religion is positively portrayed in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and that the show is one of the most religiously-based shows on television.

Jackson : A Life in Politics	Books	5	11	12	N	N	A great look at Scoop's influence on U.S. politics	There is no doubt that here in Washington state, the U.S. Senate tandem of Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson and Warren Magnuson were a valuable asset to Washington's - and the nation's - development in the 20th century. So much of our state's infrastructure, institutions, and industries can be credited to these political heavyweights. But yet, so little had been written about their immense legacies up until a couple of years ago. First we got a decent bio of Magnuson written by Shelby Scates. But then came this book - &quot;Henry M. Jackson: A Life In Politics&quot; - which is an outstanding portrait of the man and the legacy.<br />The author's main focus in this work is the profound and unquestioned effect Sen. Jackson had on U.S. foreign policy. The book brilliantly delves into Jackson's evolution from simple legislator to foreign policy guru. Much attention is made to Jackson's stances on a variety of foriegn policy issues, including his infamous battles with Henry Kissinger over the issues of detente, Soviet dissidents, and pro-Israel issues. Jackson proved a great foil for - and perhaps huge thorn in the side of - Dr. Kissinger, but with time and further examination, their debates likely benefitted U.S. foreign policy in the long run.<br />Make no mistake: while there is much on Jackson's foreign policy expertise, this is a solid biography of the man in total. We get a good look at his upbringing in and around Everett, his entry into politics, his failed presidential bids, and - eventually - his sudden and surprising death in the early '80's. Also included are the events at the infamous 1960 Democratic convention, where Jackson was very nearly chosen as JFK's running mate.<br />All in all, this is a very fair and solid biography, presenting an excellent look at the life of Sen. Jackson. This should be a must-read for political-junkies. Those of a conservative/Republican ideology should also make it a must-read, because it is made very evident how much of the current Republican stances on foreign policy were founded by Henry Jackson. <br />It has been said of &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson that he was &quot;the last good Democrat&quot;. For the citizens of Washington state, that is unquestioned and still lamented to this day. For the nation, the realization of this statement is slow to develop, but hopefully with this book, &quot;Scoop&quot;'s legacy will be recognized with the respect and stature that it truly is.	2001-07-14

I fully admit to buying this book primarily because of the draw of Gene Hackman's name on this project. I have always enjoyed his acting, so I was very interested in seeing how his inaugural effort as author would come out. Without question, it was a magnificent read! Mr. Hackman, in collaboration with Mr. Lenihan, have created a modern sea classic with &quot;Wake of the Perdido Star&quot;. They have managed to successfully mix a coming-of-age element into a more grand historical fiction epic combining the best of revenge and seafaring tales. <br />The plot, focused around the young Jack and his adventures aboard the Perdido Star, is extremely well-developed. In their prose, Hackman and Lenihan paint a vivid picture for the reader. They manage to tackle several subplots with gusto and pizazz without losing sight of the more central story: Jack seeking revenge for the death of his parents. Also, even though there are a few twists that force the reader to &quot;stretch the imagination&quot; a bit, they are written with tremendous plausibility, making them far more easy to digest. <br />As I alluded to, the prose allows for wonderful imagery. Some of the passages describing the Perdido Star's voyages immediately evoke comparisons to the best of - dare I say - a Herman Melville or, more recently, Patrick O'Brian. Of note is the passage describing the Star's rounding of the cape, as well as the &quot;battle&quot; scenes involving the Star's departure from Manila harbor and the climactic fight at Havana.<br />All in all, Hackman and Lenihan have hit the proverbial home run with their first effort, a feat reserved for very few authors. Fans of the aforementioned Patrick O'Brian should also love this book. For those who enjoy the &quot;technothrillers&quot;, this is a wonderful diversion from that genre. I certainly believe it is one of the past several years, and I hope that Mr. Hackman and Mr. Lenihan will grace us with another work very soon.	2000-12-26
US	52703441	R3CDACZSMQTWES	0684846098	975528807	Nothing Like It in the World: The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad, 1863-1869	Books	4	3	6	N	N	A wonderful tale of the people behind the project	The building of the transcontinental railroad was so important an undertaking, and left such an indelible print on this nation's history, that it is only fitting that Stephen Ambrose pen a book about this epic project.<br />Mr. Ambrose explains in the introduction to &quot;Nothing Like It In The World&quot; that he was initially reluctant to write a book about the railroad, given his educational upbringing that drilled the &quot;robber baron&quot; philosophy into him. However, he said, as he did some preliminary research, he became utterly fascinated and realized the &quot;robber baron&quot; mystique hid a truly remarkable story. <br />&quot;Nothing Like It In The World&quot; comes out less than a year after David Bain's &quot;Empire Express&quot;, an expansive book also documenting the transcontinental railroad. As such, the two must be held up for comparison. Mr. Ambrose's &quot;Nothing Like It In The World&quot; is nowhere near the length and tremendous detail of &quot;Empire Express&quot;, but it is eminently just as educational. Also, whereas &quot;Empire Express&quot; does focus on the men behind the project, the &quot;human&quot; aspect is lost amidst the technical detail. Mr. Ambrose, who has always excelled at delivering the compelling personal aspects of our history, strips away much of the expansive detail and once again shines at providing a look at the characters behind the project. &quot;Nothing Like It In The World&quot; does not lack for detail, though; it does provide many interesting facts and information, but does so in a much more concise and readable manner than &quot;Empire Express&quot;. <br />The other notable thing I found in reading this book is that it is somehow a natural progression for Mr. Ambrose to have written this after &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot;. Oh sure, he has written other works in between &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; and this one, but there was that intangible aspect that made reading this book seem like it was part of a multi-volume epic of American history. Mr. Ambrose does actually draw some links between the Lewis &amp; Clark expedition and the railroad, about how both dramatically changed the country and even comparing the perils faced in each project. &quot;Nothing Like It In The World&quot; was probably better served being written, as it was, following &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; for this reason.<br />All in all, &quot;Nothing Like It In The World&quot; is a very worthwhile and enjoyable book. Whereas David Bain's &quot;Empire Express&quot; is remarkable in its scope and depth of information - making it a highly-rated work - Mr. Ambrose scores points on writing an account that can be enjoyed by the &quot;non-academic&quot; type who may or may not read a great deal of history. It still captures much of the drama and emotion of the project, and does drive home the true significance of this project on history. <br />The only &quot;negative&quot; to this book is that this one is perhaps not to the same level of some of Mr. Ambrose's previous works - notably &quot;D-Day&quot;, &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot;, and &quot;Citizen Soldiers&quot;. This is why I give it 4 stars instead of the full 5. However, I still wholeheartedly recommend &quot;Nothing Like It In The World&quot; to all audiences.	2000-10-23
US	52703441	R7ME1ZH7P4CYK	0895262436	266973565	Sellout: The Inside Story of President Clinton's Impeachment	Books	5	63	67	N	N	A must-read for any informed voter!	We are told by those in the popular media that the public is wanting to put the impeachment proceedings of 1998-1999 behind them. But, for any informed and/or educated voter, it is vitally important to know what prompted the proceedings and the dynamics behind what transpired. &quot;Sellout&quot; by David Schippers is that book that sheds light on the whole episode.<br />Mr. Schippers impressed me tremendously with the way he carried out the impeachment proceedings. Unlike anyone else involved - that goes for every politician AND every member of the media - he was perhaps the one individual who put politics aside for the sake of law and seeing justice done. He understood that what transpired was not a result of the so-called &quot;vast right-wing conspiracy&quot;, and also understood that they couldn't just ignore the charges against President Clinton because widespread and wholesale violation of the law had occurred. <br />&quot;Sellout&quot;, then, is his account of what all took place. In it, we are presented with the facts without any pretense of political bias. He admits at the outset to being a lifelong Democrat, but in the course of this book, one can find - if he or she is honest with oneself - no political bias or spin. It is, in those immortal words, &quot;just the facts&quot;. <br />He describes how the Republicans in the Senate turned their backs on the law, along with the Democrats, all under the guise of &quot;bipartisanship&quot;. Here, the reader finally gets the names of those who sabotaged the impeachment trial before it ever cleared the House of Representatives. Mr. Schippers also plots out the total lack of regard for the law in both parties, despite the overwhelming evidence, that ultimately led to a travesty of justice.  <br />Mr. Schippers also backs up his account with the evidence that can be shown in conformity with the law. He presents partial or full transcripts from various testimony and, more remarkably, the documents showing a startling plot to naturalize immigrants (legal and illegal) in order to bolster the Democrat vote. <br />I must admit that I am a Republican, but I found Mr. Schippers account to be sickening in regards to how the Republicans in Congress acted. And if there was any way to have any less respect for the Democrats in Congress, this book found that way. &quot;Throw the bums out? &quot; After reading this book, I say &quot;You betcha!&quot;...Republicans and Democrats alike. This book shows that nobody in the Senate, and a great many in the House, should be able to claim that they did the right thing. Their actions did serious damage to the law and the Constitution, so they have nothing to be proud of.<br />I again commend Mr. Schippers for writing this book. He really came out of the impeachment proceedings as a true patriot, and does the American public a tremendous service by writing &quot;Sellout&quot;. If anything, it makes me give even more thought to who I elect to Congress in the future. That is why I rate this book with the full 5 stars, and heartily recommend it as essential reading to voters throughout the political spectrum.	2000-10-18
US	52703441	R2FHE42KERFK4C	067178546X	814935595	Blue Gold : A Novel from the NUMA Files	Books	3	27	27	N	N	An improvement over the first, but still not quite the same	I was very critical of the first joint effort by Mr. Cussler and Mr. Kemprecos (&quot;Serpent&quot;) because it was subpar by Cussler standards. I also thought he had let himself fall into the &quot;franchise trap&quot;, where he stamps his name on books authored by someone else and watches his credibility and reader base suffer. However, I wound up giving Mr. Cussler the benefit of the doubt and read &quot;Blue Gold&quot;.<br />&quot;Blue Gold&quot; is the second novel featuring the NUMA team of Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala. As with the first book, however, one cannot help but continually visualize Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino - the descriptions of the characters are that similar. Oh, there are some minor differences, but they only serve to make you feel that you are reading the adventures of &quot;Pitt Lite&quot; and &quot;Giordino Lite&quot;. The Trouts, minor characters spotlighted both here and in &quot;Serpent&quot;, are wholly unappealing because they don't bring much to the overall story, other than an excuse to print an extra chapter or two revolving around a chase or escape.<br />This book is much improved over &quot;Serpent&quot; mostly due to its, shall we say, more judicious use of detail. Whereas &quot;Serpent&quot; was bogged down by mind-numbing, superficial detail, &quot;Blue Gold&quot; is free of most of these anchors. The end result is a story that reads slightly closer to the Cussler adventures we fans are accustomed to, and moves along at a much quicker pace. The plot is average, though the closing sequence is exciting and unique, with an interesting turn of events not typically found in the Dirk Pitt tales. <br />All in all, the &quot;sophomore&quot; Kurt Austin adventure is an average effort. It is much improved over the first outing in this series, but continues to be vexed by too many similarities in characters and plot. It seems to me that for this series to fly, Mr. Cussler needs to ditch Mr. Kemprecos and just write the stories himself. Also,if he does indeed have this wealth of material for stories, he should have not bothered creating Kurt Austin and stuck with the tried-and-true Dirk Pitt. After all, Cussler claims Pitt to be his &quot;alter ego&quot;, and that familiarity has lent itself to great storytelling. Creating a &quot;mirror&quot; alter ego in the persona of Austin has not had the same effect, in my opinion. <br />I will continue to anticipate and read the Dirk Pitt novels. However, this series has proven to be a general disappointment, and makes me less inclined to shell out a few extra dollars in between Pitt adventures. I hope that Mr. Cussler will realize that he can't keep running with a knockoff version of the character that made him a top-notch author. His reputation will suffer otherwise, and he will quickly find that even lending his name to generate sales won't work the same magic.	2000-10-13
US	52703441	RX8II5KAP1P7J	039914563X	225323965	The Bear and the Dragon	Books	4	1	3	N	N	A notch down from Clancy's best...but still entertaining	I, like many of the reviewers who have already submitted their thoughts,  am a huge Tom Clancy fan. Well, let me clarify: I am a big fan of his  nonfiction and his Jack Ryan novels - not of the franchised  &quot;OpCenter&quot;/&quot;NetForce&quot;/et al. that he doesn't write but  sticks his name on. So, I was one of the throngs eagerly anticipating  &quot;The Bear And The Dragon&quot;.<br />Mr. Clancy's typical pattern in the  Ryan and Ryan-related novels is to build a wide-scale story, then blend it  all together bit by bit into a dramatic and fast-moving finale. The style  is no different here. He has an extraordinary knack for being able to write  what seem to be unrelated &quot;side stories&quot; in the course of the  general plot that wind up relating somehow to the broader picture at a  later date. He is, for better or worse (depending on your viewpoint), on  his game in this latest installment.<br />Also, with most of his novels, the  pace seems slow at the outset, then shifts to breakneck speed in the last  200-300 pages. In some respects, that was also done here, with a couple  exceptions. I found the first 100+ pages to be a very fast read. Then it  slowed down for another 100 or 150 before picking back up for a similar  amount of pages, until finally hitting that last 200 pages blitzkrieg.  <br />Like some who have reviewed already, I was both surprised and a little  put off by the dramatic increase in the sexually-related subplots,  innunendo, and references. This seemed totally out-of-character for Mr.  Clancy, moreso because instead of a small dose of it we got near-overload  measures that popped up all the way to the last sentence of the book.  Initially, in regards to the spy subplot, it was okay, but it just  escalated to the point of being far too much and also unnecessary. <br />The  conclusion also seemed a bit rushed, and, unlike his previous novels,  didn't seem to leave much &quot;open&quot; for the next Ryan adventure. It  is an interestingparallel, then, to have Mr. Clancy describe Ryan as  drained and not knowing what his next decision is while at the same time  rushing to a rather awkward conclusion that wasn't entirely satisfying.  <br />I have never had a problem with the length of Mr. Clancy's novels, for  the simple reason that they are great &quot;escapist&quot; works that you  can savor for longer than a couple of days. So, I was initially not  bothered by the 1000+ pages. But, I would submit that if he had cut out the  numerous sexual references (as mentioned above), some of the tedious  China-U.S. diplomatic meeting scenes, expanded the climatic battle, and  fleshed out the conclusion more, the 1000 pages would have been of better  overall value.<br />If there is one wish for the next Jack Ryan novel, it is  that is is a real barn-burner. And the first step towards that, in my  opinion, is for Mr. Clancy to pay heed to the reviews from his die-hard  fans (like myself). Otherwise, he does run the risk of  falling towards the  path of mediocrity. Some previous reviews have put him there already; I  disagree. &quot;The Bear And The Dragon&quot; is, overall, a fun read. It  has a good storyline, a great batch of characters, and did entertain. For  that reason, criticism aside, I do rate it &quot;4&quot; stars. It is not  Mr. Clancy's best work (&quot;Hunt For Red October&quot;, &quot;Cardinal Of  The Kremlin&quot;, and &quot;Clear And Present Danger&quot;), but at the  same time is not anywhere close to his worst. That inglorious title is  still jointly held by &quot;Without Remorse&quot; and &quot;Sum Of All  Fears&quot;.	2000-09-09

This latest installment is  a horrific disappointment. <br />When the book debuted in hardcover, much was  made about some of the dark turns in this novel. Much of it I brushed off  as critics overblowing a couple of small passages - especially since many  of the same reviews praised it as being a terrific read. I did, however,  wait until &quot;Hannibal&quot; hit paperback before I decided to read it.  By then, there had been the mini-controversy over Jodie Foster refusing to  star in the movie adaptation, and some other continued &quot;warnings&quot;  of this book's dark plot. I am thoroughly convinced now that I should have  paid more heed to the warning signals. <br />There is the old expression that  a book was so good, you couldn't put it down. Well, in the case of this  book, it was so bad I couldn't wait to put it down. The entire book seemed  geared to be less of a taut psychological thriller and more of a 500 page  &quot;contest&quot; to see which character is the most perverted, demented,  sickening, and twisted. The &quot;conversion&quot; of Clarice Starling from  protagonist to willing accomplice seemed to be overly contrived and a lame  path for Mr. Harris to take in the continuing saga of Starling and Lecter.  The story and plot was so weighed down with the perverse and sick - that  seemed to only escalate as the pages rolled on - that it moved at a snail's  pace. <br />By the story's merciful end, I was severely disappointed and  disgusted. I know that the theme of my review makes me out to sound like a  prude of sorts, but I have read my fair share of disturbing/scary books,  both fiction and nonfiction, of this genre. It wasn't the theme that turned  me off as much as it was that it was so over-the-top as to be an unwelcome  turn-off. Moreover, my disappointment lies in the fact that Mr. Harris is  obviously capable of finer,more frightening, and more satisfying work - as  evidenced by &quot;Red Dragon&quot; and &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot;.  <br />Personally, I hope that Mr. Harris ends his saga of Lecter here. To take  it any further would be an even bigger waste of time, as he has done enough  damage with &quot;Hannibal&quot; to render it unsalvagable. People who  haven't already paid their money to make this a (unfortunate) bestseller  should heed this warning: look elsewhere for a good read for your  dollar...it's not to be found here. To echo the sentiment of a previous  reviewer, kudos to Jodie Foster for passing on the movie adaptation. I wish  I would have known then (when she passed) what I know now. I wouldn't have  squandered my money on this distasteful clunker.	2000-08-05

Seawolf	Books	4	1	3	N	N	A nice rebound from the clunker that was his last book	I thoroughly enjoyed Patrick Robinson's first two efforts - &quot;Nimitz Class&quot; and &quot;Kilo Class&quot;. But after the miserable &quot;H.M.S. Unseen&quot;, I was a bit hesitant to buy this book. But,  figuring that maybe his last was a hiccup in his writing career, I decided  to read this latest installment.<br />To put it simply, &quot;U.S.S.  Seawolf&quot; returns to the strongpoints of Mr. Robinson's first two  efforts. It has a strong plotline that, given current events, is entirely  conceivable. The story whisks by at a nice steady clip, and builds to an  interesting and slightly unexpected ending. But most importantly, gone is  the painful (not painstaking) detail that was used to overkill proportions  in &quot;H.M.S. Unseen&quot;. He went back to providing some detail, but  not letting that detail overtake the story. In short, he scaled back his  descriptiveness in order to more fully flesh out the plot.<br />I was very  pleased with &quot;U.S.S.

Seawolf	Books	4	0	1	N	N	A nice rebound from the clunker that was his last book	I thoroughly enjoyed Patrick Robinson's first two efforts - &quot;Nimitz Class&quot; and &quot;Kilo Class&quot;. But after the miserable &quot;H.M.S. Unseen&quot;, I was a bit hesitant to buy this book. But,  figuring that maybe his last was a hiccup in his writing career, I decided  to read this latest installment.<br />To put it simply, &quot;U.S.S.  Seawolf&quot; returns to the strongpoints of Mr. Robinson's first two  efforts. It has a strong plotline that, given current events, is entirely  conceivable. The story whisks by at a nice steady clip, and builds to an  interesting and slightly unexpected ending. But most importantly, gone is  the painful (not painstaking) detail that was used to overkill proportions  in &quot;H.M.S. Unseen&quot;. He went back to providing some detail, but  not letting that detail overtake the story. In short, he scaled back his  descriptiveness in order to more fully flesh out the plot.<br />I was very  pleased with &quot;U.S.S. Seawolf&quot;, and - without giving away the  conclusion of the story - wonder where his next adventure will take us (it  certainly will with some new characters). I also  welcome the fact that Mr.  Robinson might have listened to those of us who were thoroughly  disappointed by &quot;H.M.S. Unseen&quot;. Those readers who enjoy this  genre of fiction should enjoy this one, and I strongly encourage those who  liked Mr. Robinson's first two books to come back and give this one a  chance.

That is, until I read Mr.  Birnbaum's excellent book, &quot;The Money Men&quot;. I found out just how  lacking in knowledge I was on this issue. <br />I was drawn to this book  because of my interest in politics, and also because I have enjoyed Mr.  Birnbaum's work with Fortune magazine and the Fox News Channel. The book he  has crafted is not a disappointment; rather, it exceeded all my  expectations.<br />The draw to this book from political pro to political  novice is that is is thoroughly readable. A lot of people tend to get  turned off by issues such as campaign finance because it is presented to us  in that &quot;policy wonk&quot; or &quot;green lampshade&quot; form that is  hard to digest. Mr. Birnbaum presents the ins and outs of the money game  and its players in layman's terms that shed things in a whole new light.  The length of the book also makes it appealing, because it doesn't give one  the feeling of reading an academic textbook. <br />Another strongpoint of this  book is that Mr. Birnbaum is wholly impartial and objective in his writing.  He doesn't focus on one side/party or the other; he gives Republicans and  Democrats equal time - and criticism. He also does it without being  sanctimonious or elitist, and I daresay there aren't too many others inside  the Beltway who could present it any better than in this form.<br />Of course,  there are a series of proposed solutions to reform the campaign finance  system, as should be expected from any book on the subject. But unlike the  politicians, Mr. Birnbaum presents proposals that would reform the system  while also being eminently digestable to the public-at-large and - provided  they had common sense - the politicians. <br />Quite simply, this book is a  must-read for those both in and out of politics.For those in the game, it  will likely do to you what it did to me: teach just how little I knew while  explaining how it works and how to fix it. For those apathetic or thinking  politics doesn't matter, this is worthwhile if only to make one understand  the issue and begin to find ways to fix the system so as to be palatable.  Most of these people think the government doesn't represent them; this is a  book that shows one way to show how they can get that lack of  representation back. But most of all, for anyone who falls into either  category, it is worthwhile to read so one can stay properly informed when  the issue rears its ugly head in the media.	2000-06-21
US	52703441	R35SJLPTICBI1O	0671747584	528393041	Eisenhower: Soldier and President (The Renowned One-Volume Life)	Books	4	16	19	N	N	A nice condensed edition of a remarkable life	Dwight Eisenhower is one of the great American historical figures of the 20th century. Stephen Ambrose - one of Ike's primary biographers - is one of the great American historians of the 20th century. Put the two together,  and the expected result is a great book. Mostly, this expectation was  fulfilled. <br />I must admit to being somewhat partial to Mr. Ambrose's work.  I read a tremendous amount of historical pieces, and his always rates very  high with me for sheer readability, quality presentation, and  non-revisionist sense of writing. I try very hard to not let this  &quot;bias&quot; affect my reviews; however, when you write so well time  and time again, it is hard not to become a big fan of any author. <br />I  noted some earlier reviews where people wanted more &quot;meat&quot; out of  this book. These people failed to note in the introduction that the book  was a condensed edition of the multi-volume work Mr. Ambrose wrote several  years before this. It is impossible to not be &quot;lean&quot; in some  areas - as one reviewer put it - when there is so much material to draw  from and only one book to put it in. I will concede that a few of the  &quot;lean&quot; portions are a drawback in this book, but given the nature  of the beast, it is a minor nuisance.<br />Eisenhower's life in the military  and the presidency are remarkable in that both facets affect government and  the military to this day. From a political standpoint, it is almost amusing  to read of the strong similarity of the issues (and solutions to them) from  his time and now. Issues like the balanced budget, defense spending, etc,  were all things Ike coped with then. The arguments on both sides in the  '50's are so much like today's that if it were possible to transport Ike to  the year 2000, he wouldn't miss a beat! <br />Having read large portions of  Mr. Ambrose's multi-volume set in the course of study for research papers,  I commend him for being able to condense it all down into thisone book.  Mr. Ambrose's prose usually flows so smoothly, but this book is an  exception. However, it's choppiness in places is really to be expected in  the process that spawned this book. It is still highly readable for  virtually all audiences, and is a worthwhile read to gain some knowledge of  the remarkable man that Dwight Eisenhower was.	2000-06-04
US	52703441	RIQ0ZNJB5KZVM	0671026682	915930446	Serpent: A Novel from the NUMA Files	Books	2	3	4	N	N	Don't be fooled by the Cussler name!	I will admit at the outset to being a complete sucker. Why, you may ask? Well, it's because I saw a new Clive Cussler book was released, introducing a new NUMA hero, and snapped it up without hesitation. Nine times out of  ten you can't go wrong with Cussler - he's an entertaining read. Then I got  the book, and realized it was co-authored. OK, I thought, it should still  be good. Well, &quot;so-so&quot; is a better description of this book.<br />It  seems that Mr. Cussler has finally followed Tom Clancy down the road to  &quot;franchising&quot;, in a manner of speaking. Clancy, as most will  know, has slapped his name on co-authored &quot;Op Center&quot; and similar  series in which the writing is unlike any of Clancy's Jack Ryan novels. The  effort is actually a novel by a lesser-known author with the Clancy name -  and perhaps some minor contributions - to sell copies. Mr. Cussler seems to  have done the same here. This book does not read like the Cussler novels  fans have grown accustomed to. It does seem that he lent some very minor  contributions here and there, as if to make sure the NUMA background  matched up with the Dirk Pitt novels, but little else seems to have Mr.  Cussler's &quot;fingerprints&quot; on it. This suggests, like Clancy, that  the Cussler name is there to ensure sales. <br />This book does read fast in  places, but overall, the story unfolds at a sloth's pace. There are  passages too heavy in descriptiveness and frivolous background, which  contributes to the slow pace of the story. The plot surrounding Christopher  Columbus and the pre-Columbus contact with the New World is a fascinating  one, but could have been better played out in a Dirk Pitt (read: solo  Cussler) novel. Too much time is spent to the rescue efforts and other side  stories, causing the main thread of the plot to suffer from a seeming lack  of focus. <br />I would sincerely hope that Mr. Cussler abandon the  &quot;franchising&quot; trail he is following with this book. It makes  money for Clancy, but doesn't do much for his credibility. I fear the same  thing could happen here with Cussler. After talking with a friend who is a  fellow Cussler fan and also just finished &quot;Serpent&quot;, I know there  is some validity to my above statement; he didn't like this book either.  <br />I think it's great that he wants to expand beyond Dirk Pitt with some  other NUMA characters. But if he intends to carry on with it, I would hope  he does them on his own. He could alternate between Pitt and Austin if he  likes; I would be happy with that. Maybe some Cussler fans will disagree  with my assessment, but I would urge that those who haven't yet bought this  avoid it and wait for the next Dirk Pitt novel. This isn't really worth the  time, and hurts Mr. Cussler's reputation.	2000-05-26
US	52703441	R3GIYRAGH32J30	0671023225	351832403	The Einstein Papers	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A good first effort influenced heavily by Clive Cussler	Given Mr. Dirgo's many ties to Clive Cussler, from working in Cussler's real-life NUMA to co-authoring two books with him, it struck me as slightly amusing that a positive one-line quote from Cussler himself was printed on  the cover of this book. It was as if to pretend that Cussler was objective  and nowhere near this project. Reading &quot;The Einstein Papers&quot;,  however, one gets a sense of just how much influence Cussler had on Mr.  Dirgo's first solo effort. <br />As with the best of Cussler's novels, Dirgo  has written a story that is easily readable and that speeds right along  from page one. Also, like Cussler, Dirgo has created the lead character  John Taft, a creation straight out of the Dirk Pitt mold (notice he even  calls himself Pitt during one chase scene!). <br />All comparisons aside -  that could take up much room and time - &quot;The Einstein Papers&quot;  does have it unique points that makes it enjoyable, starting with a  thoroughly credible Chinese strategy to reclaim Taiwan and throwing the  U.S. off-track in the process. The science revolving around Einstein and  the Unified Field Theory is also intriguing and plays well in tandem with  the China angle. Dirgo, except for a few occasions, writes the science with  a strong degree of credibility. The Taft character, unlike Dirk Pitt, does  seem mortal at times and doesn't quite get into the impossible-to-believe  challenges (even though the harmony between the intelligence agencies of  this country DO remain too &quot;superhuman&quot; for real life). Also, his  action sequences are, by and large, as well-written as other authors in  this genre.<br />Two major critiques must be noted. First, some of the key  action and plot development writing seems too compressed. It seemed to me  he could have spent less time with some of the peripheral sequences and  expanded the key ones. This is glaringly evident in the conclusion, which  is the second critique of the book. The climax of the whole noveloccurs in  the last 20-30 pages, and it seems to be very rushed. Also, the explanation  of Einstein's theory and its application in the battle on the Taiwan  Straits seemed to be underdeveloped. <br />All in all, as with his mentor's  books, Dirgo's first solo effort relies on some suspension of reality. The  rushed conclusion does prevent me from rating it the full five stars.  However, it is a solid first effort, and well worth the time to read,  especially if you are a Cussler fan.	2000-05-22
US	52703441	R3EH2MRRSNFMTP	0312971397	896256339	Cuba: A Jake Grafton Novel (Jake Grafton Novels)	Books	3	8	8	N	N	A so--so &quot;chapter&quot; of Jake Grafton's career	&quot;Cuba&quot; seemed like it might be an entertaining read, given the current political dynamics and newsmakers. Plus, I thought it would be nice to have another &quot;chapter&quot; featuring Jake Grafton. However, this  book didn't really live up to expectations. <br />As with another reviewer, I  also had to put aside the inconsistency with Fidel Castro being knocked off  in an earlier Coonts book. Also, as the same reviewer suggested, the notion  that this is a &quot;Jake Grafton&quot; book is slightly misleading, given  the small percentage of the story that features him. <br />One of Mr. Coonts'  strongpoints is that when he writes action sequences, the read can move  very fast. His descriptiveness of flight and combat are also very strong.  However, he seems to take forever to get to these assets in  &quot;Cuba&quot;. I felt the first two-thirds of the book were just short  of interminable as he set up the various storylines. Then the assault on  Cuba turned out to be quick and enjoyable reading; unfortunately, since it  was such a small chunk of the book, it wound up being too short. <br />The  enjoyment I had reading the last 100 or so pages almost made me rate this  more positively, until I actually thought about how long it seemed to take  to get there. It seemed to me that he could have balanced the action and  plot development out a little better. After having almost all action and  little to no plot development in his previous book, &quot;Fortunes Of  War&quot;, it seemed like he swung back too far in the other direction with  this one.<br />I found a couple &quot;loose ends&quot; also in reading this  that Mr. Coonts seemed to fail to address (unless he plans a return to this  storyline). One was the issue of Castro's videotape. We read of one being  interrupted and Castro dying before he can finish, with a small reference  to two tapes being there. Then near the end of the story, we find that  Castro completed one speech naming his successor, but the reader (unless I  missed something) doesn't get any explanation for when/how it was made.  Also, the resolution with the biological lab at the University of Havana  seemed to have been left hanging; all we got was a mob and Vargas being  arrested...that was it. <br />I wonder if perhaps Mr. Coonts pushed  &quot;Cuba&quot; out too soon after finishing &quot;Fortunes Of War&quot;.  That would explain an effort that seems, well, subpar. I think he needs to  spend a little more time working on a balanced story that is more along the  lines of his earlier works (i.e. &quot;Flight Of The Intruder&quot;,  &quot;The Red Horsemen&quot;, &quot;Intruders&quot;) that were far more  compelling and enjoyable. Those are works I would recommend strongly to  those who are newcomers to Mr. Coonts' work; &quot;Cuba&quot; is not a good  addition to his resume.	2000-05-15
US	52703441	R2F2LQ2MHUYOUY	0440235383	484158903	Back to the Moon	Books	4	4	4	N	N	An entertaining and fast-paced &quot;ride&quot; into space!	There has always been a wish in my mind that our nation will again summon up the courage to return to the moon. Then along comes &quot;Back To The Moon&quot;, which perfectly feeds off that wish and makes for a fun piece  of fiction.<br />I was drawn to this book after reading Hickam's wonderful  memoir &quot;Rocket Boys&quot; (aka &quot;October Sky&quot;) last year. I  wasn't sure if his fiction would be quite as engaging, but from the first  page, I knew I was in for a treat. <br />Hickam manages to weave in all the  current political and other influences preventing a return to a more  adventerous space program. Add to that a shadowy group bent on permanently  squashing space exploration and some other elements, and this book has all  the &quot;feel&quot; of a Clive Cussler novel.<br />Like Cussler, there are  some passages where the reader will have to suspend his or her sense of  reality and let your imagination take control. But more often than not,  that's what puts a lot of the fun and drama into a book. Hickam more than  compensates with the &quot;unbelievable&quot; with the knowledge of the  space program that only an insider could know. Plus, he also presents a lot  of detailed scientific aspects to spaceflight that would make even skeptics  believe that it could be possible to send a shuttle to the moon and back.  <br />The ending was a little too cliched and &quot;happily ever after&quot;  for me, but otherwise, it was one of the best fictional works I have read  in the past year. As I said earlier, this book fed off my wish that the  U.S. would renew manned missions to the moon. Hopefully there are others  who will read this who also have the desire to pick up where the Apollo  missions left off.	2000-05-12

Too many in the general public don't conceive of such an attack because it is far more subtle than  the image of mushroom clouds, but the sad truth is that bio-warfare is just  as lethal as nuclear warfare.<br />Fortunately, Ken Alibek has written  &quot;Biohazard&quot;, a look at the Soviet bio-warfare programs during his  tenure at Biopreparat in the late stages of the Soviet Union. This book,  written as part-science, part-memoir, and part-warning, excels at both  opening the shrouds that surrounded this program during the Cold War and  highlighting the potential for disaster in the modern world. <br />I found the  descriptions of the various projects the Soviets worked on to be  fascinating, and Alibek did well to explain the science and epidemiology in  such a way as to be understood by the layman. I also appreciated his  statements late in the book about how America and others in the world are  grossly unprepared for a biological attack, though this was an area I wish  he would have fleshed out a little more.<br />While I did also enjoy some of  the political maneuvering that Alibek relates throughout, I thought this  was a weak point in the book. I do not discount the heavy influence of the  politics involved in his programs, but at the same time I thought he  focused on this area a bit too much in several places. <br />Since the  collapse of the Soviet Union, the world has become perhaps more dangerous,  what with Russia and the former Soviet republics selling military equipment  to rogue nations for hard currency. We may never know what precisely is  being sold, but given the immense secrecy surrounding the bio-warfare  programs even to this day, it is only logical to suggest that some of this  work (research or physical weapons) has been among those obtained. If thatis the case, then it makes Alibek's work all the more revealing and, yes,  sobering. Given what he has described in &quot;Biohazard&quot;, one can  only imagine the horrors that are in experimentation today.	2000-05-03
US	52703441	R3I0PC53HF3P7Q	0140288503	189891237	Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War	Books	5	0	2	N	N	A gripping account of modern war - a must-read!	Sadly, modern warfare is &quot;fed&quot; to the American public in a very sanitized, video-game sort of fashion. We don't see some of the horrific images our parents and grandparents saw. As a result, unfortunately, the  ordinary soldier gets overlooked. &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; bucks that  sanitized look at war by dropping you into the midst of a horrifying  battle.<br />I read a lot of historical works, and this book is sure to go  down as one of the classics of military history as time progresses. Very  few historians are able to capture an account of battle in all its  confusion, horror, and other emotions. But thanks to a tremendous amount of  research, a journalist manages to pull it off. This book has the effect of  a punch in the face, because it does show the risk our soldiers faced in  Somalia, and how lucky they were not to rack up more casualties. <br />My only  criticism of the book is that the author seems to make no judgments in his  lengthy conclusion and afterword. While making judgments are not always a  good thing in documenting history, this operation screamed for some fault  to be doled out to any variety of people - from Clinton on down. There were  tactical errors aplenty, a doomed policy (trying to settle a centuries-old  clan war), and other things that contributed to the outcome of this  incident. To have pointed them out throughout the book, then not hold  anyone/anything accountable in nearly 30 pages of personal opinion (the  conclusion and afterword) seems to be a glaring omission.<br />That criticism  aside, the account of the battle itself is outstanding and reads very  quickly. Once the action gets rolling, it's hard to put this book down. I  would recommend it as a must-read, because it is operations like this need  to be factored into future situations where men are called into combat. Not  that it be an excuse not to go to war; simply so that as technology  advances, we don't forget the human aspects of warfare.	2000-04-16
US	52703441	R29SX2W2O4UTK5	0671008846	836520037	Dark Victory (Star Trek)	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Good, but not one of his best in this series	I must admit at the outset that I am not a regular reader of the huge array of &quot;Star Trek&quot; books. I'm a &quot;Trek&quot; fan, but not to that extent. However, I did get hooked on William Shatner's  &quot;Trek&quot; novels; they are a fun diversion from some heavier reading  I usually do.<br />Having said that, I was looking forward to this book, and  picked it up right after it hit paperback. As with all of the previous  novels, Shatner moves things right along, so the book is a quick read. But,  it seems that as Capt. Kirk's journeys continue, the quality of the books  has sunk a bit. &quot;Dark Victory&quot; is good in some ways, but overall  weaker than his others.<br />Some of the plot threads and scenes within  &quot;Dark Victory&quot; are great (i.e. the confrontation between Kirk and  Picard as the Enterprise reaches the Badlands). It makes for good reading.  The major drawback of this book, though, is that I had the feeling at the  conclusion that this was nothing but &quot;filler&quot; or a  &quot;temporary bridge&quot; between &quot;Spectre&quot; and the upcoming  book. &quot;Spectre&quot; had its flaws, to be sure, but it tied up enough  loose ends in the plot before the cliffhanger to make it satisfying. I  didn't get that out of &quot;Dark Victory&quot;. Shatner seemed to leave  everything hanging for the next book, and that is unsatisfying to this  reader. That is why I say this one seemed to be more &quot;filler&quot;  than anything.<br />At least Capt. Kirk's journeys will continue. But, I hope  that he returns to the better form that was displayed in my favorite of the  series - &quot;The Return&quot; and &quot;Avenger&quot;. I can't  wholeheartedly recommend &quot;Dark Victory&quot;, but you will want to  read it to follow the story into the next novel in the series.	2000-04-16

I had really enjoyed his last book, &quot;The Last Hostage&quot;, so I was eager to read &quot;Blackout&quot;. He surpassed all expectations with this one!<br />It goes without saying that Mr. Nance really knows his stuff when it  comes to aviation. What makes him special, though, is that he can explain  all the technicalities of any given aircraft and make it understandable for  the layman. That's the strong trait in his reporting for ABC, and shines  through when you read his novels. He also excels in his fictional writing  by developing a plot that is utterly plausible and completely believable.  These two traits combined make him one of the better authors on the market,  and helps lock the reader in for a great adventure.<br />&quot;Blackout&quot;  was one of a small handful of books that I can recall reading where it was  literally impossible to find a stopping place. The action starts right at  page 1 and keeps roaring without pause to the very end. You really were  compelled to keep plowing right through the pages to see what was coming  next. I wound up reading roughly half of the book in one sitting one  evening, then finished it off the next, and I found myself eagerly  anticipating getting back to the read during the period in between (while I  was at work!). <br />As I mentioned above, the plot is completely believable,  and is helped (as in his other books) by not being one where you can guess  the outcome well ahead. He keeps the reader guessing and on the edge of  their seat with the various twists and turns. <br />The only thing that keeps  me from giving this book a full five-star rating is the conclusion. It's a  small point, and only a minor discouragement in the book. However, I felt  he let things down a notch by resorting to the time-worn (and overdone)  sequence where the villian finally catches the hero/heroine, then proceeds  to talk for several minutes before killing them. This, of course, allows  someone else to step in at the last second to save the day and kill the bad  guy. It just seems an ending too reminiscient of every bad  &quot;B&quot;-grade action movie you've ever seen. If they were so  hell-bent on killing you immediately throughout, why would they suddenly  spill their guts to you when they finally catch you?  I guess it's an easy  &quot;out&quot; to tie up all the loose strings, but only because it's  overdone do I highlight it.<br />The conclusion aside - like I said, it's a  minor point - I would highly recommend this to anybody. Like I said  earlier, Nance writes for a broader audience than the technical details of  a Tom Clancy, so just about anyone should get the same thrills and  excitement I got out of it.	2000-03-24

His book &quot;Black Profiles In Courage&quot; is outstanding. This book, while not in the same genre as  &quot;Black Profiles...&quot;, doesn't quite meet up to expectations, even  though in its own right, it is a good read.<br />The story of Abdul-Jabbar  going to the White Mountain Apache reservation to be an assistant high  school basketball coach was truly one of the more compelling sports stories  of the last several years. It was only fitting that with all the media  attention that followed, he should write an account from his perspective.  <br />However, in the attempt to document his experience, I think Abdul-Jabbar  got caught in a literary crossroads of sorts. It seemed to me that he  couldn't quite decide whether this was to be a social-historical book about  the Apache as a whole, or a work about the sport end of it. In places, he  managed to weave the two perspectives well, because some of his coaching  experiences did indeed warrant historical perspective. However, in other  places, the historical and social background seemed more of a disjointed  distraction from the central theme of the book.<br />While the specific theme  of his coaching experience made for a good read, it seemed that he could  have fleshed it out some more. I would have liked to see more description  of his work with the big men he kept referring to as vital pieces of the  team. I would have also liked to have seen some more of what he contributed  to the team as far as philosophies and coaching. Instead, he only  highlighted about a half-dozen games, and kept repeating some of the same  things over and over. Granted, coaching is a repetitive activity, and many  things could have been repeated in a more detailed work. But, what we got  seemed to be more like another story by a reporter who had only seen a  handful of games rather than an assistant coach who had been with the team  the whole season.<br />This is a good read, adequate for addressing some of  his experiences on the reservation. However, I don't think it warrants more  than three stars because more could have been done with the book. I would  hope that at some point, Abdul-Jabbar would write a deeper  social-historical book on the Apache people, because it seems that was his  ultimate motive here.	2000-03-19

Unfortunately, &quot;Timeline&quot; reads like the work of an author who put very little effort into the story.<br />This book was another example of one that surely had plenty of promise as far as plot. It also got off to a great start that read very quickly. But, the story started to break up not even 100 pages in, and soon fizzled into a highly mediocre tale. <br />I'll be the first to admit that I'm not very big or educated on science, but it really seemed like Mr. Crichton was lamely groping to make up the rationale for his &quot;time travel&quot; concept. He seemed to have very little factual basis for it (despite his numerous scientific references listed in the book), and he wrote as if he was trying to gloss over the tenuous thread he was on by speeding along the descriptions or breaking it up with other dialogue.<br />The story, once it got to medieval France, was also very l@#e. There was so much that could have been done with the setting and the plot to that point. I would propose that it felt like reading one of the old Bugs Bunny cartoons (when Bugs fought the Black Knight). Also, the time pressure built into the story made things even worse. Mr. Crichton already seemed to be hurrying along as thinly developed as the tale was; he didn't need any extra incentive with the 37-hour deadline the plot revolved around.<br />In my opinion, Mr. Crichton has had a very checkered literary career. I really enjoyed &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot;, &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, and especially &quot;Eaters Of The Dead&quot;. Others I've read have been so-so to poor. &quot;Timeline&quot;, I think, will rank as one of his worst efforts. I will be very hesitant to read any future offerings because of this book...I certainly hope he'll put some more effort into his writing.	2000-01-05
US	52703441	R2O4WOWJ23TCSI	067080889X	102398027	Empire Express: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad	Books	4	85	89	N	N	A highly detailed, spike-by-spike account	&quot;Empire Express&quot; immediately deserves to be listed as the seminal work on the building of the transcontinental railroad, if only because there are no other historical works I can think of about this topic  that are as expansively detailed.<br />The Union Pacific-Central Pacific  venture was one of the truly pivotal moments in American history, and Mr.  Bain does indeed present it as such. It is more than obvious in reading  &quot;Empire Express&quot; that there was a great deal of time involved in  research. It is also evident that there was easily enough information/facts  to fill multiple volumes if Mr. Bain had desired to do so. <br />The primary  strength of this book is its spike-by-spike account and the vast amount of  information provided. Not only does Mr. Bain present the railroad itself,  he brings us the major players who envisioned this project, built the line,  and ensured that it would be built without interference. He also weaves in  the surrounding history (i.e. the Civil War) and politics of the era to  highlight everything that helped or hindered the railroad. <br />Another of  the strong points in this book is that Mr. Bain lets the information and  the historical figures do the &quot;talking&quot;. I give kudos to Mr.  Bain, because he avoided skewing the account through his personal opinion,  which seems to be the unfortunate trend in some historical circles today.  <br />There were two things that kept me from giving this a 5-star rating.  First, it was a very slow read. Granted, most historical works are;  however, this seemed to proceed more tediously than most. Second, there  were several points in which Mr. Bain unloaded so much information on the  reader that it was literally disorienting. When you encountered these  spots, you were forced to re-read the page(s) again to ensure you digested  it all. Or, you just plowed ahead to see where he was going with the story  so you could - pardon the pun - get back on track. While these may seem  trivial criticisms, it did detract from my overall enjoyment of this book.  <br />All in all, though, this was a very good book. I do offer a bit of  warning to those not accustomed to reading history: this is a dry, academic  read. Mr. Bain does not write in the elegant style of a Stephen Ambrose or  John Keegan. So in that regard, these readers may be disappointed. However,  for those true historians or history buffs, this will be one to read and  own for your library.	2000-01-02
US	52703441	R1XHQZ494IHR29	0399145885	842248212	Atlantis Found: A Dirk Pitt Adventure (Dirk Pitt Adventures)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Another solid ride and enjoyable read	I've read all of Clive Cussler books, and am amazed at one aspect of his writing. That is, he always seems to be able to write engaging, fast-paced novels even with some unbelievable and/or &quot;corny&quot; elements that  always seem to wreck other authors. With &quot;Atlantis Found&quot;, he has  pulled that off yet again.<br />I always find myself having to  &quot;disengage&quot; a portion of my brain when reading a Cussler novel,  because of the unbelievable and corny aspects of his writing. Dirk Pitt is  a kind of &quot;super Bond&quot;, who gets put through more abuse, injury,  and utterly impossible situations than any other fictional leading man in  the literary world. No way he can continue to singlehandedly save the world  and survive, but that's fiction!<br />The other thing I have to ignore is  Cussler's quirky sort of writing, especially when it comes to conversation.  He writes dialogue for his characters that you never hear from anyone in  the real world. It is a style that is almost overly cliched, but in an  elitist, Ivy League sort of way. This is amusingly highlighted in  &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; in the dialogue between the Special Forces  troops. I know of no troops in my experiences, including a stint in the  Navy, who spoke as Cussler's characters did. He made them out to sound like  they went through high society etiquette training rather than boot camp or  SEAL training. <br />Like I said, though, despite these corny and unbelievable  elements, Cussler enthralls the reader with his historically and  archaeologically-based plots. He manages to wrap the reader's focus around  thes believable elements and lets the reader enter an Indiana Jones-esque  tale.<br />&quot;Atlantis Found&quot; has a great plot centering on the Amenes  culture and its tie with the myth of Atlantis. Pitt's nemesis in the novel,  the evil Fourth Empire, is a worthy foe that also adds a great historical  element to the storyline. I too enjoyed the plot twist that came about  midway through the book, as did a previous reviewer. It was one I did not  see coming until you hit it. And, I enjoyed the fact that for once, Pitt  had to have SOME help in saving the world, courtesy of Special Forces. Of  course, Cussler has Pitt saving the troops' bacon once and making all the  crucial decisions, but at least he had some help in thwarting the bad  guys.<br />If there was one element in this novel I did not like, it was  Cussler's self-serving insertion of himself into the story to meet/help  Pitt. However, this is a pet peeve I've had of his novels for awhile now.  It was neat the first time he did it, and maybe the second time too. But  now it's old and is a weak point that seems to do nothing more but to  soothe Cussler's ego. I would hope he halts this aspect of his writing the  next time around.<br />All in all, though, &quot;Atlantis Found&quot; is an  enjoyable story. It is a nice cap to the 1990's for Cussler, who has put  together a string of solid novels this decade after being sort of  &quot;hit-and-miss&quot; early in his career. While this novel did not  quite rank with my favorite Cussler novel, &quot;Treasure&quot;, it is  still one I highly recommend to Cussler fans and also to those reading him  for the first time.	2000-01-01
US	52703441	R2SMXG99M59FTP	0440225345	648790483	The Prodigal Spy	Books	2	9	12	N	N	A quick read, but a marginal story at best	This was another novel that was hyped quite a bit in media circles when it was released in hardcover. Yet once again, it fails to live up to its hype. The premise of the story, revolving loosely around the Communist  witch-hunting of the 1950's and the distrustful mindset of the late '60's,  was promising. Mr. Kanon's portrayal of Nick Kotlar's inner conflict was  also great. However, the story fails to deliver on much else. There was so  much that could have been done with the premise and historical setting that  Mr. Kanon did not achieve. The plot was also very, in the words of a  previous reviewer, &quot;transparent&quot;; you could literally figure out  who did what about 200 pages or less into the novel. And even then, the  outcome was very unsatisfying. Also, a nagging problem for me was the  numerous historical inaccuracies. A couple have been listed in prior  reviews; the notable one I caught revolved around the Order Of Lenin medal.  Given recent historical works surrounding the KGB, the Order of Lenin was  indeed awarded to non-Soviet spies (i.e. Kim Philby). However, those who  were awarded it were not allowed to keep it beyond their award  presentation, much less be able to travel abroad with it. Therefore, I  could not get past the fact that Kotlar's father was supposedly living in  Czechoslovakia with it. Inaccuracies in the spy genre are very near to  mortal sins, especially with authors such as Clancy, Ludlum, and DeMille as  competitors in the field. A weak, easily solved plot and inability to make  the most of a historical setting and premise that is ripe for the picking  are also huge gaffes. It is a quick read, but very disappointing. I can't  help but believe that if another, more able writer were given this type of  story to work with, it would be a far better and more enjoyable read.	1999-12-13
US	52703441	R3LCWX22FVS4DM	0553580930	101241499	A Man in Full	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Nice concept...but a little &quot;ragged&quot; and disappointing	Like Tom Clancy, Tom Wolfe writes very detailed and descriptive prose. I have rarely had a problem with that sort of writing with Clancy and some of Wolfe's previous books. More often than not, that descriptiveness is  considered a hindrance or an asset, depending on the plot. The critics have  always knocked Clancy for his detail, but that same criticism was not  leveled at this book by the same reviewers. Sad, because it should have  been. Here, Wolfe writes some beautiful passages. Other times, and probably  more often than not, his penchant for expansive detail bogs down the plot.  Unfortunately, that takes away from what should have been an excellent  story on the present state of society in the U.S. South. It read very fast  at the outset, but by the middle of the book, I found it awfully  slow-going, making reading seem more of a chore than the usual pleasure it  is. I was also disappointed in the conclusion. After lavishing us with  expansive detail through the first 700+ pages, Mr. Wolfe wrapped up all the  &quot;loose ends&quot; of the plot in the space of five or six pages. After  slogging through the book, that sort of conclusion seemed dramatically  out-of-kilter from the rest of the story. It was almost as if Mr. Wolfe had  been imposed a page &quot;cap&quot; of some sort, and he was scrambling to  conclude the story so as not to exceed that limit. To sum up, though, I  certainly would have expected more from this novel, considering Mr. Wolfe's  excellent work to this point and the critical acclaim this book got when it  was in hardcover form. However, it is very slow going, a bit  &quot;ragged&quot; in parts, and sort of a disappointing effort. It seems  that he could have told this story in about 200 fewer pages, and left more  room to conclude the story properly. Be forewarned...do not be taken in by  the critical hype. It is one of Mr. Wolfe's weaker efforts; if you've never  read him before, read &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; or &quot;The Bonfire OfThe Vanities&quot;. Those are more enjoyable to read, and a better example  of Mr. Wolfe's talents.	1999-12-06

So perhaps many in the media - as well as many potential voters - were a bit let down by this first book from the  Governor. I think the American public has become so used to tell-all books  from celebrities that are filled with outlandish stories worthy of print in  tabloids that Gov. Bush's book is a &quot;letdown&quot; of sorts. But don't  let these cynics sway you.<br />What has been largely ignored or missed  altogether in many media reviews is that Gov. Bush does indeed expound upon  the &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; philosophy that has defined his  campaign for President. While the meat of this political philosophy comes  in the last chapter, the Governor relates some stories from his political  career and life before politics that give the reader a glimpse at the  foundation of compassionate conservatism. It is not entirely an  autobiography in the traditional mold, but it does draw from a good portion  of his life. Besides, should we be expecting every detail of his life when  he potentially has much greater things ahead of him? <br />Like I said, don't  let the cynics in the media or in the public steer you away from reading  this. If you're unsure what entails a compassionate conservative, you'll  get a pretty good idea here. And, thankfully, you get it without the  tabloid exposes that are so regrettably trendy these days.	1999-11-27
US	52703441	R32ECHJHXBQBUW	068483958X	975622600	All The Best, George Bush: My Life in Letters and Other Writings	Books	5	43	48	N	N	A lighthearted and insightful book...rare from a politician	In an era where politicians are looked upon with a great deal of contempt and are portrayed (sometimes rightfully so) as cold and heartless, along comes a book to buck the trend. President Bush opens himself up to the  reader to get a glimpse of his thoughts and the events going on around him.  It is very revealing in parts, and generally shows his maturation and  perhaps some change in perspective as the years progress. Pres. Bush does  not hide the fact that he is an emotional man, and that is expressed very  well in this book. One can't help but be touched by the humor, sadness,  insightful opinion, and lightheartedness this collection of letters  encompasses.  Fair warning to those expecting a book that is  &quot;wonkish&quot; in policy and serious reading: this is not that kind of  book. Nor does it pretend to be, and that's what makes it enjoyable. If you  were expecting more serious material from President Bush, I suggest you try  &quot;A World Transformed&quot;, which he co-authored with Gen. Brent  Scowcroft.  All in all, &quot;All The Best...&quot; is a nice read, and  should appeal to a wider audience than most memoir/autobiographical pieces  from our political figures.	1999-11-27

I just finished reading this biography of one of the most influential non-political figures of American history. Mr. Chernow deserves all the critical acclaim he received for writing this; it is truly a remarkable  work. At the outset, it seemed that Chernow was going to give a  &quot;polished-up&quot; version of Rockefeller's life. However, you soon  begin to see that he instead presents Rockefeller in a rather impartial  light, exposing both qualities and faults with equal judgment. Mr. Chernow  wonderfully intertwines the events of the day as he narrates Rockefeller's  life, the life, innerworkings, and sheer dominace of Standard Oil, and the  philanthropic entities that came to make Rockefeller revered by many. When  the reader completes this book, he/she is able to formulate their own  opinion of Rockefeller because we were given such a well-rounded, thorough,  and fair presentation. If anything else, that is the essence of what a  truly outstanding biography should be able to do. That is why Mr. Chernow's  book is such a success and enjoyable read.	1999-08-30
US	52703441	RCJDU72QFGMGD	0684855712	295996803	Years of Renewal	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Excellent!	Dr. Kissinger is without question the most regarded and respected Secretary of State in this century - if not in U.S. history. Any work by him I consider to be essential reading, and as such, this was a must-read  for me. I have read the three installments of his memoirs, culminating in  this one. I will concede to those who don't read a lot of history/current  affairs books, this one seems a bit daunting. However, out of the three,  this one is certainly quite &quot;readable&quot;. It is the best-written of  the three; Dr. Kissinger seems to exhibit a great deal more clarity and  reflection in this work.  Critics of Dr. Kissinger have complained that he  is only writing because of some need to make excuses for his foreign policy  &quot;blunders&quot; - namely, in regards to Vietnam and the USSR. I would  argue emphatically that this book is not such a work. Dr. Kissinger  presided over some of the most troubling and chaotic events of the century.  While there occasionally is a hint of defense on his part for his actions,  it is certainly not a &quot;puff piece&quot; designed to give him a  favorable legacy. One must remember that Dr. Kissinger was by and large  commended for his actions in the foreign policy arena. History already  looks upon him favorably. He is not a monumental screw-up like Robert  MacNamara, who is futilely trying to rewrite his legacy with book after  book. These are Dr. Kissinger's memoirs, the purpose of which is to shed  light and reflect on the events he witnessed and dealt with. Thus, he does  not need to make apologies or absolve himself. He is merely writing a  historical record of his service, a career that needs no bolstering or  &quot;revisionism&quot;. I recommend it strongly, not only to those readers  of history and foreign policy, but to those of you tired of the  incompetents now directing foreign policy for this country. Dr. Kissinger's  work must be studied and factored into current world events, because he was  the grandmaster of that domain.	1999-05-25
US	52703441	R1TEA3G7EJRSB6	155850723X	440973700	Old Soldiers Never Die	Books	5	23	24	N	N	Excellent...the definitive bio of &quot;Big Mac&quot;!!!	General MacArthur is one of those truly fascinating historical figures, one that truly deserves study by even the casual military history student. He has been labeled an &quot;egomaniac&quot;, a &quot;primadonna&quot;, a  &quot;genius&quot;, etc., etc. This book attempts to blend all those  summations into one biography, and does so flawlessly.<br />Mr. Perret's work  is by far better than the other noted MacArthur biography, &quot;American  Caesar&quot;. Mr. Perret is a great deal more balanced and thoughtful in  his treatment. His work is also a good deal more enjoyable to read.<br />The  one thing that I think is noteworthy about this book as a whole is that  while it does a marvelous job of chronicling MacArthur's life, it is done  without casting judgment one way or the other. I noted above that MacArthur  draws a wide range of emotions - from egomaniac to genius. Mr. Perret  manages to corral all those different facets of MacArthur's personality and  present them in such a way that the reader is allowed to see all sides  equally and make his own conclusions. That, I believe, is what separates  Mr. Perret's work from &quot;American Caesar&quot;. &quot;American  Caesar&quot; was largely biased towards MacArthur's primadonna persona, and  as such, that bio fell on its face. <br />While Mr. Perret expertly and  rightfully spends much of his work covering MacArthur's fight for the  Phillipines - a place that occupied all his thoughts during WWII - he is  remiss in not adequately covering Korea, specifically, the landing at  Inchon. That is Mr. Perret's one shortcoming in this book. The Inchon  landing was perhaps one of the greatest master strokes of modern warfare,  and definitely of MacArthur's waning days in the Army, yet it is passed  over without a lot of detail. I think Mr. Perret failed to detail it as it  should have. I would have focused on MacArthur's strenuous campaigning to  land at Inchon, which was fraught with hazards and potential catastrophe.  MacArthur was the only one who could have suggested Inchon, yet was the  only one who could have carried it out, much less thought it would have  succeeded. Instead, in this bio, Mr. Perret basically glosses it over, much  to my disappointment.<br />All in all though, I did enjoy this work very much.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone wanting to read about this  amazing and tragic historical giant. It is definitely the better of the  MacArthur biographies.	1999-05-25
