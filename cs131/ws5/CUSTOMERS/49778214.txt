Quite a few of the cases have no information available at all, as the other reviewers have mentioned, and although the LAPD has done a great job maintaining paper on most of these cases, some details are bound to slip through the cracks.   <br /> <br />A few of the cases depicted in \\"Scene of the Crime\\" are also depicted in Huddleston's \\"Death Scenes\\", though nowhere near as graphic. Many of the locations found in the book are still standing, as a matter of fact, I often pass by the building shown on pgs 52-53 (traffic collision at 1st and Boyle) though now its an apartment building but still featuring the unique parapet up top. <br /> <br />Overall a pretty good read.	2004-11-21

This book tells it the way it is.  Long ago, dirty fighting wasn't our way of doing things.  Cheap shots were unacceptable, and the good guy always wore the white hat. Our country went to war, and our troops were getting beat down and killed by a brutal enemy who had no rules. This book helped change all that. Written by Col. Rex Applegate, formerly of the OSS, it taught a lot of combat troops how to fight to win- to be as brutal and savage as the enemy.  Applegate's classic text shows all the tricks to disable or kill the enemy with a knife, gun and even your bare hands.  No fancy moves, no John Wayne nonsense (sorry Duke), and no BS!! This is the real deal!  <br />The pages on close combat is the best part of the book and more than justifies the price.  The chapters on small arms is interesting as well, teaching cover, concealment, and point shooting, as opposed to aimed fire. It's obvious thst Col.  Applegate was an advocate of realistic firearms training (silhouette targets in a killhouse opposed to bullseyes at the range), and although some of the techniques and weapons depicted are dated, it makes for good reading, and one could learn the fundamentals of combat shooting from these chapters.  Police officers could learn a few defensive tactics that may give them the edge they need in a streetfight or while trying to subdue a combative suspect, but I would not recommend the use of some of the techniques for handling prisoners, as they are very outdated and unsafe....Also interesting is Applegate's chapter on battling Communist tactics and stategy, a bit of nostalgia for all you Cold War Commandos, ready to take on the reds! <br />Read this book and LIVE!!...	2001-07-05

It includes everything from what kind of magnafying glass to buy, to buying rare gold and all things in between.  I felt the most helpful sections were the detailed write-ups on grading (different services, methods, and evolution of) and how to spot artificial toning, counterfitting, and doctoring/cleaning. It also explains how not to get ripped off at coin shows and by con-artist dealers. I would recommend this for beginners, as well as intermediate coin collectors.	2001-06-27

Experienced bike riders will find the book uninformative and will criticize the authors opinions about certain aspects such as sportbikes.  The author, although  he does an outstanding job laying out the basics such as types of bikes, motorcycle safety, and actual riding of the bike, he is very critical of sportbikes for beginners, and rightfully so.  But a novice, properly trained, can handle these bikes provided he knows his personal limits and has respect for the machine.  <br />Although I would recommend this book to a beginner, there is no substitute for a training course such as the MSF Ridercourse, offered at most community colleges.	2001-01-07

During the Iranian emmbassy crisis in England, the world watched as black clad commandos stormed the building, each carring a radical new machine gun, different than anything anyone had seen.  That was the HK MP5, a spinoff of the famous G3 rifle.  Although the G3 and MP5 had been in production since the late 50's/ early 60's, the public had rarely seen or heard of these remarkable weapons.  Soon they became the weapon of choice for counterterrorism units, SWAT teams, and other specialized units for close quarter combat, and long range sharpshooting.   This is the best book availible for information on Heckler and Koch rifles, submachine guns, and general machine guns.  Includes the history, development, and other facts about the G3, MP5, HK33, and any other variants, both in automatic and semi.  Has information on the rare Vollmer conversions, sniper models, as well as information on accessories such as the HK69 grenade launcher and other rarities.  Pictures are great, as are the descriptions of each of these weapons. The book does not have information about HK pistols, but I believe the author has written a separate book regarding them.  If your a HK fan, a gun nut in general, or are just curious this is the book for you.	2000-12-13

It has good background information and the stories of both sides of this conflict prior to the incident.  It seems that it focuses more on the criminals, and what drove them to do it, but it lacks many of the officer safety innovations that the CHP developed after this incident.  Everything from basic PMA to felony stops were revised because of this.  While  I was at the explorer academy, they stressed this incident to us over and over, and why we needed to be alert, in shape, and knowledgeable in out tactics as an individual, and as a team. Now I know why, after reading about the darkest day in the history of the California Highway Patrol.  But the book is lacking, and could have been a bit better.  A CHP PT instructor could probably give you an as good or better account of what happened.	2000-12-07

This book details Elizabeth Shorts backgound from growing up in Massachusetts, migrating to L.A. and falling for servicemen while mingling in the Hollywood nightlife scene to ending up split in half on a sidewalk at 39th and Norton.  John Gilmore really put a lot of effort into finding every little detail about the Dahlia, suspected killers, the dump site, police reports, media frenzy etc, etc.  Really a masterpiece of true crime investigation.	2000-12-07

It  seems most of the info is on trails in the Santa Monica mountains and of the trails are located relatively close to &quot;civilization&quot;, that is, they're not situated way out in the boonies.

There is, however, no substitute for actual hands-on training and wheel  time, and the book emphasizes this.

Lots of basic stuff as well as advanced techniques with a  little bit of tuning thrown in to inform the reader how a car reacts to  driver input.  Great insight into what a racecar driver goes through, but  at the beginning of the book I got the feeling like Smith was saying  &quot;don't try to become a race car driver cause there are lots of guys  better than you in Europe&quot; which is true, but I also don't need  someone to tell me that the sky is blue.	2000-09-08

It also covers badges from other city agencies  as well as obsolete and prototype badges. However, I thought the best part  of the book was the chapter on the history of the LAPD, starting with its  days as a volunteer force in the mid 1800's.

What starts of as a good history of the LAPD, turns into a  blatant attack on the department and the men and women who serve under it.  Domanick fails to realize that some of the &quot;brutal&quot; tactics and  procedures of the department were acceptable in the early half of this  century.

I found the introduction very interesting, as well as  Powell's running commentary of government and society throughout the book.  Although I don't agree with Powell's views, I believe in his right to  express his views, as well as present this type of information.  At the  rate we're going, in 50 years your government may decide to outlaw this  book, along with Catch-22, Brave New World, and Animal Farm.	2000-09-03

Dodd is a British soldier who is separated from  his unit during the Napoleonic Wars, and must endure cold, thirst and  hunger, all while trying to fight his way back to friendly lines.  His  training, motivation, and dedication to duty all take over to help him  overcome his personal war.

The story revolves  around a group of inner city policemen and their off and on duty antics.   &quot;The Choirboys&quot; shows what big city coppers endure every day,from  the brutal crimes on the streets, to their ongoing battles with their own  selfish supervisors and how they cope with what they see during their daily  tours of duty.  Wambaugh's characters (no doubt modeled after officers  Wambaugh knew himself) come to life, and you will learn to love some of  them, and hate others.
