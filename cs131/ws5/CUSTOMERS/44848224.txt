Besides being responsible for me changing my major at university and falling absolutely in love with medieval history, this book is thoroughly entertaining to those who may not have a history passion or even passing knowledge of the time period.  Penman is detailed enough to help along readers with little to no knowledge of medieval British history, but enthusiasts will delight in her detail and character development.  If you have even a remote interest in history, Richard III, or murder, intrigue and deceit, read this book!!	2004-06-22
US	44848224	RCMNSHGHIH62T	0515101222	64032814	Spring Fancy	Books	4	2	2	N	N	An entertaining springtime novel	A very entertaining novel, although parts of it were difficult for me to fathom, particularly the reason why Winn continues to stay with Paul, even after beginning her romance with Joseph.  However, this scenario makes for a wonderfully angst-filled romance, for those readers who enjoy tortured lovers!  Joseph is endearing and a classical &quot;good man&quot; and is therefore easy to fall in love with.  Winn is slightly more difficult to support, in my mind, but still inspires sympathy.  Recommended for Spencer fans!	2004-05-04
US	44848224	R2N9S5HWWXWN3W	038078145X	15276320	Stranger in My Arms	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Anticipation	Certainly the best part of this Kleypas novel is the anticipation of wanting to know if Hunter is actually Hunter or not; with this premise as the central part of the story, the novel holds the reader's interest.  The character of Larissa (Lara) is not one of Kleypas's better written women, but Hunter is riveting.  The subplot of Lara's sister and her abusive relationship is rather harsh and, to be honest, realistic for a romance novel; it will definitely either make or break the novel's enjoyment for readers.	2004-05-04

I found the passion to be somewhat subdued and she works very hard to craft the relationship between Niall and Sabrina, I feel they never really &quot;clicked&quot;.  Niall's continuing relationship with his mistress is also a break from Jordan's traditional standards and I found it rather unappealing.  I would recommend this for die-hard Jordan fans, but not for someone just being introduced to the author.	2004-05-04

I did not feel sympathy for Laura and felt that her character was weak and did not inspire empathy or compassion.  Rye, while I felt sorry and empathized with his situation, was rather annoyed by his lack of respect for the Laura-Dan situation.  In the end, I liked Dan best of all and felt that he conducted himself the best given the situation, and actively felt sorry for the man.  Not really how you want to end a novel, feeling sorry for a man other than the hero!	2004-05-04

I tried several times to become engaged in the story (a nun falling in love with a father, etc., seems like it would be engaging enough!!), but always found myself putting the book down and forgetting about it.  I think a Spencer fan should attempt this book, as others seem to like it, but should probably already enjoy the author before they try it.  The only reason I did not give it 1 Star is because I respect the author and her attempt too much for that.	2004-05-04

Brooding, artistic, emotionally withdrawn and stubborn as heck, Lucas is a wonderful hero and Madeline provides a perfect heroine foil for him.  While rather sweet and naive, occasionally a bit too much so, their relationship develops into something pure, although, of course, it takes them several hundred pages to figure that out.  Lucas's adversion to commitment (and his relationship with his family and neighbors) seems a bit too much at times, but can be dismissed as a by-product of his artistic temperament.  A must for Kleypas fans!	2004-05-04

This is one of my favorite Kleypas novels simply because the romance seems pure and true; Holly and Zachary are characters that readers can relate to and want to see succeed, in this case, in falling in love.  Zachary is the type of hero that I love to love; deep and brooding and ultimately vulnerable to love.  I would recommend this novel to anyone who loves romance and is looking to be introduced to Lisa Kleypas!	2004-05-04

Yes, there is the angst-filled torment for the lovers which can be headily enjoyable.  Sure there are complications in the forms of fiancees, family obligations, and lack of support from friends and family, but I found that the story was rather predictable and the characters not terribly strong.  I would recommend this book to die-hard Spencer fans and certainly not as an introduction to the author.	2004-05-04
US	44848224	R2PGV5U2YCN37E	0515084891	408737567	Years	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A classic!	One of the first Spencer books I ever read and I continue to re-read the book every year.  Spencer is phenomenal creating truthful, honest characterst the reader can relate to; Linnea and Teddy are realistic and flawed, yet endearing.  The story between the two of them is brilliant and, again, realistic; the conflicts in their romance are as appropriate in today's modern world as they were on the prairie at the turn of the century.  Highly recommended for anyone who wants to read a classic romance novel!	2004-05-04

She takes the concept of the &quot;mail order bride&quot; and crafts a beautiful, engaging love story around it.  Karl and Anna are wonderful characters that readers will be able to relate to; Karl is strong, traditional, and of the quiet persuasion while Anna, typically, is his opposite, possessing an out-spoken, fiery personality.  However, the central part of the story and the issues in their lives are often surprising and keep the story flowing, as do their reactions to it.  &quot;The Endearment&quot; is a wonderful novel about how love can grow in unlikely places and that the heart can survive, build upon, and ultimately become stronger through many trials.	2004-05-04
US	44848224	R3MQZJMFDSDFRW	0515090395	813411978	A Heart Speaks	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Two for the price of one	A very entertaining read, although not personally one of my Spencer favorites.  The characters of Allison and Lee will appeal to strong, independent women who have been burned by love, and yet remain optimistic about romance.  While the male lead characters, in my opinion, could have been examined more in depth, the end result is a pleasant enough romance.	2004-05-04

Lorna and Jens are a wonderful couple and their innocence and naivete are refreshing in lieu of other jaded romance pairings.  The love is honest, the romance is true, and I always end this book on a sigh; it's that good!  This novel is a must for anyone who loves romance, particularly of the sweet and endearing type!	2004-05-04

An avid Kleypas fan, I was eagerly anticipating this novel, but found it hard to wade through, follow, and got completely confused during the flashback section.  While Emma and Nikki are entertaining as the central characters, their relationship and dialogue was not enough to make this a positive experience for me.  This novel certainly follows a different formula from Kleypas's other books and I would only recommend it to her devoted fans.	2004-05-04

Gentry's character is roguish yet sweetly entertaining and Charlotte is a wonderful foil for him, a somewhat reserved girl who comes into her own while standing up for herself and the love she finds with her husband.  I would definately recommend the book for any Kleypas fan, but not as a novel of introduction to the author.	2004-05-03

The story is pretty typical: a sweet, innocent country girl lost in the big city with no experience or understanding of where she is who meets a jaded, mysterious man who dances around the fringe of acceptable society.  However, that aside, Kleypas manages to weave a completely unique and lovely story around the central characters that is touching and engaging.  The story contains the right amount of romantic angst, is very steamy and yet remains real.  Highly recommended!	2004-05-03

The novel begins with a unique premise: a woman on the verge of her &quot;spinster birthday&quot; ordering a male &quot;companion&quot; for the evening.  While Jack's character is fairly typical to romance novels (tall, dark and brooding), he retains a measure of vulnerability that is a wonderful addition.  Amanda is a brilliant foil to Jack's character and the two of them have an entertaining courtship.  Highly recommended!	2004-05-03

I found the characters to be non-engaging and the story predictable and dragging.  I would recommend this novel only to a die-hard Kleypas fan.	2004-05-03

While an interesting and entertaining read, I would not place it as one of Kleypas's best efforts.  (Which still makes it better than many other authors.)  The plot is engaging enough (estate working boy loves rich employer's daughter, which, as we all know, brings drama), but I often feel there wasn't enough reason NOT to be together.  Several times during the novel I just wanted to say, &quot;Get OVER it&quot; and put the book down.  On the flip side, it was nice to have the subplot of Aline's sister and McKenna's partner; it livened up the book a bit.	2004-05-03

As my graduate area of study is the Middle Ages, I was intrigued and bought the book on a whim ~ and haven't stopped buying Terry Deary's books since!  Are the books chock-full of historical facts guaranteed to allow someone to walk away thinking they know everything about the Middle Ages, Greece, Rome, France, or any of Deary's other topics?  No, of course not.  Are the books a wonderfully entertaining (and illustrated!) way of addressing what can admittedly be a bit of a dry topic?  Of course!  I say any books that can make someone, young or old, become interested in history should be embraced fully.  And, hey, I learn something new from every book I read, which is an added bonus!  Further, I think these books definitely appeal to adults who have an interest or education in history ~ much as what &quot;The Reduced Shakespeare Company&quot; teaches us about Shakepeare is true about Deary's treatment of history: the better you know the original, the more funny and entertaining the condensed versions are.	2004-02-23

Not only did I get a kick out of the Shakespearean references (English major that I was), but Rosalind is entertaining with her refusal to fit any romantic norms.  And Griff, too, as the pursurer wanting to settle down was nice to see for once; it was lovely to see the female force wreak such havoc upon the male protagonist.  Perhaps the \\"misleading identity\\" crisis was a bit overdrawn, but original.  And Rosalind's unorthodox behaviour definitely led to more than a few entertaining and inticing scenes!	2002-12-13
