Okay, so his taste and mine aren't even vaguely similar. That doesn't mean there aren't some great ideas in this book. I like how Mr. Lowell breaks everything down to a point where the decorating-impaired (such as myself) can handle a redecorating job. You don't have to do everything he says; choose what works for you.<br />I've been putting off redecorating for years, because I was paralyzed by all the decisions that have to be made. This book sets a starting point, and then the next place to work on, and so on, until you have a nicely decorated room. Yes, his taste is a bit over the top, but I can see the value in his approach.<br />If you're looking for absolutes, don't buy this book. If you're looking for a place from which to take off, this could be the book for you.	2002-01-25

However, if you're throwing a dinner party and you've never cooked a roast before, this book will get you through it with an ease you never thought possible. My one disappointment is that there aren't a lot of &quot;serve with this&quot; suggestions; on the other hand, a quick flip through the section detailing the things I might serve with my roast (say, potatoes) will allow me to come up with a number of accompaniments I might not have thought of otherwise.<br />I have the 1975 edition also. With all the slaps at the new edition, I have to say that a lot of the biases in the 1975 book are gone in the new one; e.g., the new one recognizes microwaves as a fact (necessity?) of life, where the earlier version deemed microwaves as unworthy of the authors.<br />Every so often you've got to update, and as updates go, this is a very good one.	2001-12-04

This book is a must for all but the most advanced practitioner.  Mr. Schiffman's perspective is unique.  Most books don't give anywhere near enough detail. On first look, it would seem that Mr. Schiffman gives way too much detail; after reading, and trying, his instructions, I've seen that there's no such thing as too much detail.  Postures I'd given up because they didn't do anything for me now feel really good. If you're serious about your practice, you want this book.	2001-03-01

There isn't anything I've tried in this book that hasn't been wonderful.  My very favorite thing would be the cinnamon stick truffles -- a friend says I should call them chocolate fudge explosions!<br />No, there aren't a lot of pictures; on the other hand, I don't happen to think they're necessary.  No, there isn't an overwhelming amount of technical advice, but there is just enough, and I happen to think that's good enough.	2000-12-21

I could die happy just reading this book. Another wonderful, decadent, and very well-laid-out (both the look of the book and the recipe directions are fabulous) book. I'm especially fond of his comments on dusting madeleine pans with flour (sorry, you'll have to read the madeleine recipe).<br />I brought the Cocoa Pound Cake to work this morning, and it's everything you would expect from Mr. Death by Chocolate. It's buttery, fudgy, nicely chocolate. The perfect thing with midmorning coffee. Needless to say, it disappeared in seconds.	2000-10-19

I've been trying to get back into my practice for the  last couple of years, after a number of orthopedic rehabs.  I haven't been  too successful; most books are awfully rigid about the &quot;right&quot;  way to do the postures.<br />Then I got my hands on this book.  There are  still a few postures I can't do, and shouldn't  do, and will never be able  to do.  For the rest, Mr. Kraftsow shows adaptations that are allowing me  to ease back into my practice, and feel like I'm doing myself some good.  If you've looked everywhere else, try this.<br />I do have a problem with this  book, though.  It's not for beginners.  It does give decent descriptions of  what you should be doing at each stage of a posture, and how each stage  should feel, but it doesn't give those things with the descriptions of each  series of postures.  I think that's a big drawback; you're not going to  follow one of his practices and keep flipping backward to find out how  exactly to do it.  On the other hand, if you're not a beginner, this may be  as good a book for you as I'm finding it is for me.	2000-09-05

For those of us who tend to be armchair travellers, Mr.  Bryson does all of the research AND all of the difficult travel!  And he's  funny, besides.  What could be better?<br />As I read this, I could picture  myself on the cross-country train, getting stranded in the desert, seeing  the Big Lobster, and getting stung by something I'd regret.  That, to me,  is the mark of a good travelogue -- you are there.<br />Some say they found  &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; preachy, and that this book is refreshing  in that it's not preachy.  I'll take issue with the term elsewhere; the  difference here is (as Mr. B points out) that there's no need to warn the  Australians of what they could be losing -- they do a very nice job of  conservation themselves, thank you.  Unlike us.  But that's another  story.<br />Read this book.  If you want a good laugh, if you want to go to  Australia, if you don't want to go to Australia.  It's very definitely  worth the read.	2000-08-25
