This novel, while set in Edinburgh, for Scotsman readers, and full of in jokes, is one that can be enjoyed worldwide. Little Bertie already has fans writing to McCall Smith from all over the world asking for him to be liberated from his ghastly mother. All life is here in this novel - you don't have to be Scottish to appreciate its wonderful humour, since we all know people like the wimpish boyfriend, the slightly batty older lady, the snobbish politicians, the pushy over-ambitious mother, and the bright young woman trying to work out what on earth it is she wants to do in life. In other words, while the characters are set in Edinburgh, they could just as well be in New York, Los Angeles, St Louis, or Richmond (Virginia). A more entertaining book you could not find - perfect reading for the summer by the beach, hiking in the Ozarks, or whatever plans for vacations near and far you may have (it will be a great Christmas present, for that matter). Read it, love it, and then buy ten copies for all your family and friends to share it with them. Charles Dickens - you have a rival!

(Why can't US publishers bring it out the same time as those in the UK?) <br /> <br />Mme Ramotswe is married! (Or IS she - you will have to read to the middle of the novel to find out.... ) Not only that but Grace Makutsi finds love as well - and to find out THAT happy ending you really will have to read until the last chapter. <br /> <br />Many yuppies (do we still use that term?) love this book, and those in the series, because not much really happens - and that is the whole point! It is both hilariously funny as always, with very sharp observations of human life, and yet profoundly gentle throughout. Life is SLOW, and for many people in the fast lane, that is perfect reading. (And for people who live in the middle lane like me as well...) You can be wonderfully calm reading this book - the whole series is the perfect antidote to the manic life we live in the West, in the 21st century. Five cheers for Alexander McCall Smith! <br /> <br />In one scene, Grace Makutsi meets an odious young woman called Violet, who got only 50% the typing school (Grace, as we will recall, got 97%). But unlike Grace, Violet has all the best jobs and all the men after her - she has one fifteenth of Grace's character and ability, yet gets far because she is glamorous. Haven't we all been there - seeing far less talented people get ahead for reasons that are profoundly unfair? This is what is so good about the Ramotswe novels - they are superb morality tales, showing true values without in any way being preachy.  <br /> <br />In short, give this book to all your friends - 10 copies at least! Let's see it go to No.1, which it richly deserves to do, and a good sight more than some so-called fiction out there these days. <br /> <br />Enjoy! <br /> <br />Christopher Catherwood (author of CHURCHILL'S FOLLY: HOW WINSTON CHURCHILL CREATED MODERN IRAQ: Carroll and Graf, 2004)	2005-04-19

Although Simon Mitton is a distinguished astronomer, this is science written for anyone intelligent, regardless of background - those of us in the humanities as well as sciences can read this fascinating book with equal enjoyment. <br /> <br />Fred Hoyle was probably wrong on how the universe began, holding to steady state rather than the Big Bang, in which most scientists now believe. But his reasons were perfectly cogent, as Mitton points out. He was also the first true communicator of science to a wide audience, including his brilliant science fiction plays for children that I can still recall over 40 years later. If astronomy is now a cutting edge subject, with considerable lay interest (especially after Mitton  and Hoyle's Cambridge colleague Stephe Hawking) it is all because Hoyle was there first. <br /> <br />In short, Mitton has written an outstanding book for all of us. I should also add that the mistakes pointed out in the Publisher's Weekly review have been corrected by the final version - they must have seen proof copies. <br /> <br />Buy this book! Science has become fun for all of us, and Hoyle's pioneering research and communication skills set that ball in motion. Simon Mitton is a worthy follower of his old master, and this book is proof of that.  <br /> <br />Christopher Catherwood (author of CHURCHILL'S FOLLY: HOW WINSTON CHURCHILL CREATED MODERN IRAQ: Carroll and Graf, 2004)	2005-04-12

This book is a superb introduction to globalisation in our world today. You really cannot understand the 21st century without it. <br /> <br />He divides globalisation into 3 phases: <br /> <br />1.0 up to 1800 when things depended on states <br />2.0 when it was multinational corporations 1800-2000 <br /> <br />and then <br /> <br />3.0 since 2000 when it has been up to brilliant individuals. <br /> <br />Over 400,000 Americans, he reminds us, will have their taxes sorted out in Bangalore, and in Britain we are phoned every few minutes by outsourced call centers in the same city. We truly do live in a global world, and Friedman briliantly shows us how. <br /> <br />For my money, pp 391-406 on Al Qaeda, whom Friedman so aptly calls Islamo-Leninists, is worth the whole price of the book for its outstanding analysis of the real causes of terrorism today. <br /> <br />Buy it! <br /> <br />Christopher Catherwood (author of CHURCHILL'S FOLLY: HOW WINSTON CHURCHILL CREATED MODERN IRAQ, Carroll and Graf, 2004)	2005-04-05

Now he has written THE essential field guide to Narnia, CS Lewis's wonderful Christian allegory and novel for children, and in plenty of time for the Disney film coming out in December. This makes it both reliable and essential reading for any Lewis buff, and also the ideal gift for anyone you know who becomes interested in Lewis after seeing the movie this Christmas (2005) and beyond. Make sure your church bookstall has 20 copies, and make sure too that you give this essential reading to your friends and family at Christmas. You will not get a better guide, both in terms of spiritual content and literary knowledge, than this splendid book by Colin Duriez. He has pulled off yet another amazing book to add to the many other definitive works on Tolkien and Lewis that he has written already.

Sharan Newman is a far far better writer than Dan Brown, and is someone who really does her historical homework properly. But who is the international megaseller? Dan Brown.... However, if, like me, you are someone who loves the past, and wants to know what REALLY happened in your fiction, Sharan Newman beats Dan Brown any time. This wonderful book shows why - it reveals the truth behind all the sad a-historical nonesense in the Brown book. I suspect my fellow Christians will, like me, dissent from Newman on some theological issues - her theological grasp does not, alas, match her historical knowledge - but on all issues of medieval and more recent histoy, Newman is 101% on the money and well worth reading. Give this to any friend who has been taken in by the Da Vinci Code and I am sure that they will never look at that novel in the same light again. (Let's hope they also become readers of Sharan Newman's wonderful medieval mysteries as well....)

(For medievalists and later, Sharan Newman's is the best, but unlike this book, her grasp of theology is a little shaky...) It is written in a measured tone - no wild denunciations here - and shows conclusively that Brown's understanding of the early Christian church, and of theology, are pure rubbish. But as well as telling us the truth about Gnosticism, Mary Magdalene and other key things, Witherington shows us the deep theological agenda behind not just the Da Vinci Code itself, but all the other works in that genre. It is therefore a challenging book for any Christian to read, one that makes us think about our own world view and why we believe what we do. Make sure you read this book, and that everyone in your Sunday School class does too - it will be essential reading for when the Da Vinci movie comes out, and a first class apologetics/evangelistic tool for your non-Christian friends who will be flocking to see it. Make sure you and your pastor know Witherington's book.

This is what makes this wonderful book so rare - it is scholarship combined with readability. Not only that but he reminds us in detail and vividly that the main battle for Germany was not on the Western Front, with the US and UK, but on the Eastern Front, against the USSR. But here again the book scores well - because while many recent books (such as those by Anthony Beevor) give outstanding accounts of the Eastern Front, Hastings describes BOTH Fronts, and in relation to each other. In other words, this is THE book to give the full picture of how World War Two ended.

This is the best book with which to start them on their discovery of the truth. (For those of college age or older, I would suggest Ben Witherington's book instead). For as this book makes clear, there is a very definite spiritual agenda behind the Da Vinci Code, that many secular writers might miss. I don't think that this book, while Evangelical, is Right Wing (maybe because I am a British Evangelical, where things on that front are difficult). While this may not be a book of profound scholarship (again, see Witherington for that), it is, as one would expect from Cook, a superb tool for teens, and just the right kind of book to put in the hands of your church youth group. In fact, make sure that all of them have read this before the movie comes out, so that if they get asked by friends, they can use this book by Olson as a first class evangelistic tool.

The books are wonderful descriptions of Edinburgh life, and those who know Scotland will love them (along with his most delightful 44 SCOTLAND STREET collection of stories from the Scotsman newspaper...)

In addition this series (and the mystery set in Edinburgh) show that McCall Smith really is a genius, since the voice in this series, in the Sunday Philosphy Club and in the justly famed Ramotswe series, are all completely different.

But Fergusson is an idealist, as well as a smooth talking lecture (always huge fun to hear in person).

It looks at it  as it really happened -  this is based on  solid scholarship and years of careful research. Those wanting  a more partisan history will not find it  here (my own FIVE LEADING  REFORMERS should be  more to the tastes of those that do)  but as an objective work, looking at the  Reformation in the wider context of European, and later global,history, this book cannot be bettered. For those  of us who loved this author's CRANMER and then  his TUDOR  CHURCH MILITANT, this is the big book  from him for which  we have all been waiting.

The Modern Library Chronicles are a great series and as the nephew of a veteran of the kind described in this book (Uncle Lacy Foster Paulette Jr fought in Normandy and in the Battle of the Bulge), it was especially exciting to see a book that gives due honour and credit to those of the Greatest Generation who fought for the freedom we now all enjoy and take for granted when they risked their lives in North West Europe in 1944-1945.

Then when they finally got their independence back after the end of the USSR, they found themselves involved in a bloody war with Azerbaijan.

What is refreshing about Ivins is that she is incisive, witty, thorough - and totally lacking in the kind of extremist venom that discredits liberals and enables conservatives to write them off accordingly. She is neither Maureen Dowd nor Ann Coulter (to take examples fairly from both sides of the divide). So whether you are a Democrat or not, you should enjoy this book - if sensible Democrats like Ivins and sensible conservatives like Brooks prevailed, political commentary would be a much better place!

But is the glass half empty or half full? For those of us for whom it is half full,  it is great to see a book that gives 21st century people apologetics for the kind of questions that they are asking today. If the Apostle Paul quoted from pagan philosophers and poets on Mars Hill (see the Book of Acts) then we ought at least to understand the language people use in the 21st century - we can do so without in any way compromising our own firm beliefs as Christians. The fact is that, as the Psalmist put it, the &quot;heavens declare the glory of God&quot; and as we progress in the 21st century with all sorts of amazing discoveries, that truth becomes ever more evident! God really is there! We need great apologetics today since the spiritual hunger of today's lost people is as great as it ever was. Let's get going!

OK so they are not world class literature but we can't be reading Dickens all the time and for what they are Forsyth's novels are great.

In the USA you have separation of church and state and no religion in public schools. At the same time you have churches that are bursting at the seams (like Grace Community Church in CA, for example and Tenth Presbyterian, PA, for another). In the UK we have a state church and compulsary religion in schools and the British church -  while my wife and I do attend one bursting at the seams - is in nowhere near as good a position. Likewise the biggest growing church in  the world is in Communist China - yes, you did read that correctly! Despite DECADES of vicious persecution the Communisti government has not only failed to wipe out Christianity but there are now at least 40 times as many Christians in China than when  the Communists came to power (which if my maths is OK is a 4000% increase!) Is God in charge or is He not? Globally, Christianity is growing like never before and in many cases in areas such  as Africa long after the white missionaries have gone. God is in charge, folks! He is on the throne! Jesus is Lord! Most Western European countries would do anything to have the kind of conversion growth you have in the USA! John MacArthur, who should know, as his church is growing exponentially every day it seems, makes it clear again  and again - it is conversion growth  and biblical teaching that spread God's Word and increase His church  - if it were like this book suggests, Britain would be predominantly practising Christian and the USA a spiritual wilderness, yet in actual terms it is the other way around!

Thankfully, as I show in my own CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE, President Khatami and the moderates in Iran today are doing their best (there were PRO-AMERICAN riots after 9/11!), but it is an uphill struggle, all going back to our support  for the Shah in 1953. This is a must read book! Christopher Catherwood, Cambridge; author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)	2003-09-06

I think it would probably be fairer to say that neoconservative Republicans are from Mars - but then so too are &quot;liberal hawks&quot; in the Democratic party.  Likewise, few people could have been more pro-American than the Poles, who are very proud of being Europeans but are very much on the hawk side when it came to the war on Iraq. So not that straightforward! Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)	2003-09-05

(Look at the tragic decline of moderate Islam in Indonesia and the deaths of countless Christians and non-Wahhabi Muslims there). Read this book and pray for genuine reform in Saudi Arabia - Crown Prince Abdullah needs all the help he can get!

I agree that Fox is probably not as fair and free as it says it is, but then, sadly, many of your channels aren't either! It is a shame that the USA does not have a history of the kind of public service broadcasting that makes ITN a beacon of genuine righl/left political balance in a world where we really do need a free and fair picture of what is going on.
