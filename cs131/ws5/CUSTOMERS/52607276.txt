Dex was so strong, despite the turmoil, and the stigma that was already set out for him. He was sort of a warrior being that he accepted punishment for a crime that was accidental, and was able to live  with the unkind words and feelings his father felt towards him.   Anitha  was also a strong, independent, and successful black woman, who without a  doubt loved Dex and stood by his side no matter what happened.  Beautiful  novel!!!! I've read all of Bette Ford's novels and she hasn't disappointed  me yet. Keep up the good work!! I can't wait for your next novel.	1999-01-27

This novel about love, pride, and sacrifices couldn't have been written by any other writer. Amanda was the most caring and loyal  person. Amy and Marcus couldn't have asked for a more sincere, and loving  individual in thier lives. I enjoyed the way Marcus attempted to keep  Amanda at arms length. However, Amanda's kindness touched him to the very  core. Luke was also a very encouraging character in this novel. He seemed  to read his brother's mind and actions without uttering a word. Excellent  novel!!!! I loveed it. It reminded me of the first one Sealed with a Kiss!!  Keep up the good work!!	1999-01-07

This novel was about a mother who sacrificed her life, for the happiness and protection of her daughter. She put her needs before others. It shows strong will and  determination for teenage mothers to rise above the odds that are pending  against them. I was happy to find out that Ms. Williams let herself go long  enough to find true love and happiness after what happened to her. I can't  imagine anyone's parents disowning them at such a ripe age, all over a  mistake.    Nevertheless, she put her life together, started a shelter for  teenage mothers, and gained respect from others who were apprehensive about  the outcome of the teenage mothers. Absolutely excellent!!! Keep up the  good work!!	1998-11-18

This novel was very creative and some of the quotes incorporated within the novel were very inspirational. Teddi loved her husband and her family so much she  risked her own life to win back the life she missed two years of. Although,  I was sort of put off by some of the unrealistic plots in this book it was  still very good. For instance, the Feds actually letting J.T. go without  any other complications to hinder him in returning to hsi family. J.T.'s  disapperance for two years from his wife and his child's life was upsetting  to me as well. In my opinion, Teddi took his homecoming in stride. In other  words, it wasn't that chaotic or emotional as I expected. Especially, if  the person you love disappears out of your life for two years and suddenly  reappears. Eddie, Teddi sister seemed a little to desperate to get Cecil  under her claws. Neverhteless, the book deserved a 4 star rating because of  the underlying message and the love the emanated from the characters.  I  loved the recipes and the defintions of the 7 days celebrating the Kwanza  Holiday!!!!	1998-11-09

The legacy of the Heart family was built upon nothing but betrayal and lies. Cole Heart stood out from the rest of his family. I admired in this novel in his pursuit to keep  his family's chain of stores successful. It took a lot of guts for Sonja to  tell Cole the truth, but it worked out for the better. I was so glad the  truth finally came about Cole's cousin and Aunt Justine. I must admit it  kind of threw me for a loop a first, because I thought that Cole and Sonja  were indeed brother and sister. However, the story had a beautiful ending  with Cole and Sonja staying together despite the turmoil surrounding them.  Excellent novel!!!!!	1998-11-09

Especially Martin and Carrie. Martin needed someone to  stroke his ego and Carrie needed someone to love her. In other words, they  were made for each other. However, I felt that the plot where two old  friends who found each other after all those years and fell in love was  very creative. This novel was interesting at times.

The characters in this novel were indeed lifelike. I  couldn't believe the way the men treated these women. Especially that  Raymond brother!! I bet you he was a Pisces!!! The women in this book were  so needy and unhappy it was awful. However, the plot kept me interested all  the way until the end. I felt like I was reading a supense novel, I  couldn't wait to see what happened next. Overall, Mr. Dickey did a superb  job and I can't wait to snatch up a copy of Friends and Lovers.

OK, at first I was a little apprehensive about this novel because the first couple of chapters read slow. However, afterwards it turned out to be one of the best novels I have ever read. It actually made feel different afterwards. I felt like I knew these people. The passion and friendships were heartwarming. I fell in love with Leonard and Tyrel's character's.  The proposal scene where Leonard and Debra are contemplating marriage bought tears to my eyes. That was so sentimental to me. I've already read Sister, Sister and that was excellent as well. Jerome Dickey deserves an A+ for his work. I can't wait to read Milk in my coffee. Keep up the good work!! In other words, YOU GO BOY!!!	1998-10-06

I loved this thrilling suspense, yet dashing love story. Coco was full of laughs, and Jax was tempting altoghether. Jax tried to his best to keep Coco at armslength, but Coco broke down his resistance. I loved the way he threw her over his shoulder when his feelings towards her changed. Caveman!! I like it.  Adrian and Mr. Thorp got exactly what they deserved. Jail time!!. However, I was sort of dissappointed with the ending. I was hoping that Jax and Coco developed a more permanent relationship. Say like, marriage !! Nevertheless, it was a good read. I've read all of Robyn's books and I enjoyed all three of them. I can't wait to read Blue's story. Keep up the good work!!

However, I grew tired of of some of the astronomical jargon that was being said. Patricia appeared to be a intelligent and strong woman. Nevertheless, I was upset when she insisted on finding Kenneth, instead of leaving well enough alone. The man was pronounced dead for christ sake!!

However, this novel left me emotionally drained. I'm an avid reader of all types of novels. This is the first time I ever cried, when reading a novel. The men in this novel just left me feeling hurt and angry. How could miles and Cullen be so insensistive? This novel hit close to home. This book displayed how disappointing realtionships can be. Cullen really upset me, because he invested so many years into his marriage and threw it all away on a whim!! Overall, the book was ok. I just felt like I was  the characters Natasha and Abra.

Little does a great job of examining the attitudes of the elite blacks within the African American community. I really felt sorry for the character Alice. The situation with her brother, and what he did to her made me actually cry. I think I probably would have been traumatized after that. I can sort of relate to her family situation as well. She felt groomed to be a high achiever, than just being loved the way she was. Her fiance though would have never gotten any forgiveness from me. There is no way I would've taken him back after he cheated. There are no excuses for cheating. Overall though, the novel was good!! I can't wait for the next one to come out.	1998-07-15

Raimond and Sable's story was funny and romantic. I was in total awe about the history in the novel. I'm ashamed to say it, but I never new about some of the history in the novel. One of the things that amazed me though was the sincerity of Raimond and Sable to take in three homeless children. That took a lot of love and courage. I doubt that most people would have done that.

I am an avid reader of romance novels and Beverly Jenkins is at the top of my list. I must say that African American women everywhere should feel truly blessed to have such a gifted writer within our time. The romance in the novel was sizziling,and passionate. It gave me goose bumps and made me wish that I could conjure up a Leveq look-alike. The history was astounding and informative. Sable and Raimond made a terrific couple, despite their differences. It surely took a large heart for the Leveq's to take in three homeless children. It took me by suprise to find out that the characters Galen and Hester appeared throughout the novel as well. I have read all of Mrs. Jenkin's novels and they just keep getting better and better. I can't wait for Mrs. jenkins to come to the Atlanta area for a book signing tour.
