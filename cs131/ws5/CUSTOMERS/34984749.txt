According to the professor the bubble is based on mass psychology.  More and more herdlike investors buy just because prices are going up and up.  That sure sounds dangerous.  But what will happen next?  Forecasters are uncertain about price levels of homes in one year's time, and for 5 to 10 years, they have no idea.  There is danger out there but we don't know when it will hit us.  No one knows how to forecast a turn in mass psychology.  This all does not make real estate sound as solid as it is supposed to be.  But if you are investing for the very long run as I do, don't sell in a panic, because on page 16 Professor Schiller writes:  \\"Real estate home prices showed remarkable stability over the whole boom-and-bust cycle of the stock market surrounding 1929.\\"  So real estate is a solid investment after all.	2005-06-21

Bush was elected by "deranged" (insane) voters	This book has only one idea:  the red state voters voted against their real interests (mainly economic) because the clever Republicans deranged their thinking by talking about religion, abortion, homosexuality and the war on terror. <br /> <br />You can fool most of the people most of the time if most of them are \\"blind\\" and \\"deaf\\" (using many different words, the author in effect is calling the red state voters stupid) as to what the Republicans are really like. <br /> <br />Thomas Frank reminds me of Charles Dickens.  He was disappointed by America, because when he was here he made the mistake of looking for a country similar to Great Britain.  The author is from Kansas, but would also like America to be a very different country (reading between the lines, I think he would like France better).  His long list of complaints proves that.  He does not like our system:  \\"Wealth has some secret bond with crime....That, plus the borderline criminality of capitalism itself...,\\" etc., etc. <br /> <br />When an entrepreneur selects a town with lower labor rates in which to build a plant, according to the author, this creator of jobs has evil intentions.  The new workers who get jobs will somehow be \\"victims\\".  Businessmen apparently should invest in high-cost union towns and not exploit the unemployed people in poor towns.  It is clear that Thomas really does not like how free markets work.  Thomas points out all kinds of problems and flaws in the economic system but offers no solutions.  The book does not provide a description of a better economic system.  But I gave this book three stars because I enjoyed his factual descriptions of Kansas.  And I got a good history lesson.  The book would have been much better if he did not have such a big political ax to grind.	2005-05-11

This magical gem is a must-read for anyone who has ever been in love, or lost a loved one, or tried to imagine what happens when we die.  It will haunt you with its vivid flights of fantasy, deep characters, and unusual story, and it may even remind you of dreams you may have had.  Mitch Albom gives us a wonderfully hopeful look at finding personal meaning in our routine daily lives and at maybe even getting a second chance at actions we deeply regret.    Some passages are pure poetry and you will want to highlight them to read again and again:  \\"Love, like rain, can nourish from above, drenching couples with a soaking joy.  But sometimes, under the angry heat of life, love dries on the surface and must nourish from below, tending to its roots, keeping itself alive.\\"    Whatever your thoughts on life and death, religious or not, you will find every page a pure joy to read.  You will want to share it with friends who have a real treat waiting for them.  Very highly recommended!	2005-05-11

And in the end Donald Rayfield is much more clear about which way, he thinks, Russia is going. Russia is moving back to something like the Soviet Union (but smaller thankfully). The FSB is now acting like the KGB and brutal Stalinist methods are being used in Chechnaya. <br />The overall impression I got from reading this book was that Stalin was so powerful and he ruled for so long that he imprinted his DNA on Russia's famous Soul.	2005-05-10

Simon Montefiore in shocking detail reveals that Stalin on the evil-scale was at least equal to Hitler. A horrible example of how evil Stalin was is on page 479: '\\" Russian soldiers even raped Russian women newly liberated from Nazi camps. Stalin cared little telling Djilas \\"You have of course read Dostoevsky? Do you see what a complicated thing is man's soul..?\\"' And Stalin did nothing about it. What would that monster Hitler have done in case like this with German soldiers and liberated German women.   <br />But,then, why would so many Russians want to bring back the Evil Empire today? The author does give a possible answer on page xx: \\"Modern Russia has not yet faced up to its past: there has been no redemption, which perhaps still casts a shadow over its development of civil society.\\"  Given President Putins most recent actions in Russia, I think, the \\"perhaps\\" in this quote is not really necessary.	2005-05-10

If you are looking for light easy entertainment, this is the book for you. At the start you sense there will be a happy ending. This book can be used as an antidote if you have recently been reading dark heavy books whose characters you know from the start are not all going to be living happily ever after at the end (I'm thinking of some of Dostoyevsky's works). <br />Max Powers, the movie maker, is the ultimate match maker and social engineer (or a Santa Claus exerting maximum power to do good?).  He manages to turn \\"real life\\" into a classic happy-ending Hollywood movie (when they do make a movie based on this book I hope they don't get confused). <br />Everything, indeed, is alright with the world at the end.

Through his characters Ivan and The Grand Inquisitor he expresses a profoundly Russian view of the world, that man prefers security abd even death to freedom of choice.<br />This  book is a fascinating story about murder, but to me what Dostoyevsky reveals about Russia, in telling that story, is even more fascinating. And, yes, chilling (they are the only people who, in a matter of hours, could devastate us). If as you read this book you keep in mind what is going on in Russia today, you will see that Dostoyevsky's Russia is still intact, but now with nukes. Current events are proving the truth of what experts on Feyodor Dostoyevsky have said in the past: if you want to understand Russia you must go to him as a source, \\"He is Russia\\".<br />Russia after trying freedom is turning away from it step by step just like Ivan, The Grand Inquisitor, that is, Feyodor predicted. In Russia freedom is being traded for bread and a sense of security.<br />Dostoyevesky is dead but his spirit still rules in the Kremlin.<br />Russia does not even want freedom nearby. Just recently the Kremlin opposed the spread of freedom to the Ukraine and rebuked America for encouraging freedom in Belorussia.<br />President Bush says everyone wants freedom but polls indicate he is wrong about Russia and Dostoyevsky is correct. A poll of Russian people showed that nearly a half of them want another leader like Joseph Stalin. President Putin sounds like the Grand Inquisitor when he says the break-up of the Soviet Union was a great catastrophe! But another poll indicated that 70% of Russians want Putin to be even more authoritarian.  We may not like the fact that Putin is moving away from freedom but he is looking over his shoulder at Dostoyevsky/Russia and is afraid that he is not moving fast enough. Other groups are in the wings ready to take over and they would make Putin look like a good guy.<br />What a genius Dostoyevsky was in understanding and describing nature so basic to his people and instincts so deep that they are even immune to revolution and exposure to freedom. And he weaves this revelation all into a complex multi-dimensional novel about patricide. Or it could be vica versa.	2005-04-25

However, he is doing it with excellent Pinots so he is not a wino.  Miles is not finishing himself off quietly in a dark corner.  He is active and adventurous.  Miles and his friend Jack party hard in the sunny vineyards of California.  He tries to kill himself more quickly when his book is rejected.  But at the end there is hope when he finds a new love.  The movie's good but the book is better. <br /> <br />You could get a hangover reading this book.  The characters drink wine continuously.  Readers who enjoyed wine too much at one time or another will get more out of this book than those who have always been sober, let alone those who have never had a sip of wine.  You will learn a lot about wine, especially Pinots, at the same time as you are entertained by the four drinkers, Miles, Jack, Maya and Terra.  Also the author's (Rex Pickett's) creative descriptions of various landscapes in California vividly capture the feeling I have when I travel down there. <br /> <br />If you are dealing with rejection from a college, an employer, but especially from a publisher who is rejecting your creation -- your book! -- Miles' extreme reaction (drinking a bucket of wine and spit and running into the ocean to drown) and the revelation he has from that event is good therapy.  It will give you a healthy perspective.  You may even be able to laugh about your rejction (at least grimly?).  I wish I would have read this book when my book was being rejected.  It would have made me feel stoical compared to Miles.  I did get published.  In the end Rex Pickett does not get Miles published.  Not a completely happy ending?  Could Mr. Pickett have a sequel in mind?  \\"Upright\\"?  In \\"Upright\\" Miles and Maya write a fairly successful non-fiction book about wine.  Miles gains experience and status as a published author.  With Maya's help he rewrites his novel and finds a publisher.  The book is a smashing success.  In the process they learn how to enjoy Pinot in a healthy way.  Two glasses a day.  No more endless splashes for \\"just tasting\\".  But who would read such a book?  It could be made funnier if they joined Alcoholics Anonymous and started writing books about non-alcoholic wine (or would that be a tragedy?).   <br /> <br />A warning to potential purchasers of \\"Sideways\\".  If you are offended, put off, distracted by four-letter words -- they are an integral part of Rex Pickett's creativity in this book.  In days gone by you would say their language would make a sailor blush.  Jack lies and cheats.  Miles steals from his mother.  So why should they speak like angels?  There is incidental violence but no one gets killed.  That is a refreshing change from all those best-selling thrillers. <br /> <br />This book for most readers, I think, is worth four stars.  But for personal reasons I gave it an extra star.  \\"Sideways\\" enabled me to experience once again that great high feeling I got from being rejected and then finally getting published.  So an extra star for purely emotional reasons.	2005-03-04

If you are reading this book just to be better informed, I think you will get your money's worth.  I feel I got a five-star education.  But if you are going to read it to make a decision to buy or not to buy Berkshire Hathaway, you should keep these two points in mind:  First, almost everyone considers Warren Buffet to be the world's greatest investor.  This special attribute of Mr. Buffet might be reflected in the price of Berkshire Hathaway stock.  If Warren Buffet were no longer around, what would that do to Berkshire Hathaway?  Hasn't Mr. Buffet's greatness built in a premium in Berkshire Hathaway stock?<br />Second, this book proves that Mr. Buffet beat Mr. Market most of the time under normal circumstances.  In abnormal circumstances, Mr. Market could beat Mr. Buffet.  Abnormal circumstances would exist if Mr. Market went into a long, deep depression (like he did in the 1930's and dropped in value by 90%).  And could a second terrorist attack similar to 9/11 cause Mr. Market to panic and create abnormal circumstances in the economy?<br />No matter how good the company, Mr. Market can and will hurt the value of its stock.  If there is another terrorist attack like 9/11, Mr. Market will panic and Coca Cola, Washington Post, GEICO, etc., would all suffer terribly.	2004-04-21

If you have discipline and courage, he thinks you can actually buy low and sell high.  The barber tells you to buy undervalued stocks and then sell them later for a higher price when the real value of the stock is recognized by the market.  The author does warn you that you do have to be able to tell the difference between an undervalued stock and one that is unhealthy.  This is tough to do.  So it is not the barber's fault if you lose money because he leaves it there for you to figure out.  <br />What about buying low and selling high in real estate?  On page 178 Mr. Chilton writes that sometimes it is possible to &quot;buy it [real estate] at any price, sell higher.&quot;  But in other parts of the book he writes that real estate prices won't always keep going up. <br />The 10% solution is not enough, it won't get the job done for many readers.  There are signs that inflation, after a long absence, is on the way back.  It should be a 15% solution.  <br />I deduct one star because the book does not have an index.  I think an index is very useful, and adds value to a book.  However, on page 44, after discussing all the pros and cons of owning versus renting, the author says that buying the condo was a good idea.  I became so happy that the barber put the new condo owner on the right track, I gave him back the star.	2004-04-16

An interesting and educational book about stocks, but it could be dangerous for some people who may come to believe the stock market will make them rich if only they have the patience.  To warn these people, I quote Professor Siegel himself from an article: &quot;In a severe inflationary period, real estate tends to do better than stocks, as the 1970's demonstrated.  By contrast, severe inflation would devastate bonds, just as it would stocks.&quot;*  Elsewhere in this article, the Professor makes it clear that over a 30-year period you can expect real estate (in his book I can't find a place where he considers real estate as a viable investment alternative) to outperform stocks and bonds.  I know inflation has been under control now for quite awhile, but no one knows what inflation will be like in 10 years, let alone in 30 years. <br />I recommend this book for the education about the stock market it provides the reader.<br />*Jonathan Clements, &quot;Investing Isn't Just Happily Ever After,&quot; The Wall Street Journal, March 2, 1999, p.

He makes it clear, I think, that investing in individual stocks is not meant for those people who don't have a strong stomach and are not good at doing research.<br />Mr. Lynch recognizes that for many people their best investment, in the end, turns out to be their home.  His view of the investment world is broader than that of many other stock market experts.  <br />P.S.  An additional caution of the risks involved in picking individual stocks to invest in:  A long time after Peter Lynch wrote this book, I read that he lost a significant amount of money by investing in an upscale carpet business that did not pan out as anticipated.  Even the greatest track record does not guarantee future results.  So beware!  No matter how good you are, and how strong your stomach is, you will have to absorb some big losses sooner or later.  Peter Lynch did.	2004-04-15

(I personally think income-producing real estate is superior to common stocks, but there are no national statistics to prove that.)<br />How should we invest in common stocks?  Mr. Bogle has the answer for most of us, it is indexed mutual funds (S&amp;P 500, Russell 2000, etc.).  This book should be reread if you start getting impatient and begin to feel that your stock-picking ability is superior to the stock market indices.  <br />How readers will feel about Mr. Bogle's book, say, 10 to 20 years from now, depends upon what happens to the stock market in the future.  If the stock market has a disastrous crash (index funds do not provide immunity from crashes) along the way, and 15 years from now it is, say, at 10,000, people will say, &quot;Boy, was I stupid to believe Mr. Bogle, and put so much into the stock market.&quot;  <br />The bottom line advice of this excellent book is that the stock market is a good bet, so obviously if the market does not cooperate, the credibility of this scholarly work will suffer.  20/20 hindsight will condemn even the best books.  I am betting all my stock market investments, mostly indexed mutual funds (most of my money, however, is in real estate), that there won't be a disaster and the market will be significantly higher.  The history that Mr. Bogle provides in this book shows that this is a reasonable bet.	2004-04-10

A Book of Practical Counsel (Revised Edition) (Collins Business Essentials)	Books	5	6	13	N	N	Too bad real estate was not also in Benjamin Graham's field	If you have only time to read one book on investing, this classic should probably be it.  But if you recently have read some of the popular get-rich-quick books, &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; is a necessary and powerful antidote.<br />The author has an extremely realistic view of the investment world.  He sees the real risk where speculators may imagine there are instant riches.  For Benjamin Graham, safety of capital comes first.  But at the same time, he makes it clear that safety is not guaranteed, even if you do have a properly selected and well balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds.  <br />On page 25, Mr. Graham warns the reader that: &quot;There is no certainty that a stock component will insure adequately against 'large-inflation' but it should carry more protection than the bond component.&quot;  The author does recognize that: &quot;The outright ownership of real estate has long been considered as a sound long-term investment, carrying with it a goodly amount of protection against inflation.&quot;  With this statement, he seems to recognize that inclusion of real estate could make an investment portfolio stronger.  But he does not analyze real estate extensively as an investment in his book because he says that it is not his field.  <br />Too bad he did not broaden his scope and also become an expert in real estate.  If income-producing real estate had been looked at as thoroughly as stocks and bonds in &quot;The Intelligent Investor,&quot; I believe many readers, with most of their equity in real estate, would be calling Amazon.com about giving this book a sixth star.	2004-04-09

He is living proof that not everyone can be Donald Trump.  And that is a good thing for people to be aware of.  <br />The essence of the advice this book is offering can be found on page 133: &quot;Disciplined savings will outpace any investment scheme.&quot;  Next the question is, what do you do with your savings?  Their answer is mainly mutual funds.  The risk in buying individual stocks, they claim, is astronomical.  If the stock market continues to be relatively stable, &quot;financial peace,&quot; I think, can be achieved by following the authors' formula, but not if there is an extraordinary financial crisis.  If an unusually large stock market crash did occur, a lot of mutual funds would start to look like &quot;investment schemes.&quot;  Financial peace for many people would be shattered.  <br />I deduct one star because the authors place too much faith in mutual funds.  Mutual funds, after all, do invest in individual stocks that are traded on the stock market.	2004-04-06

This book is not for the novice wealth seeker.  For example, Donald tells you to live large as you pursue your riches.  Well, you can't do that if you don't have any money to start with.<br />The general investment advice that Mr. Trump offers is very brief, simple and valid.  He tells the reader to invest in things he understands.  In modern times, doesn't Warren Buffet have a copyright on that phrase?  On page 32 Donald makes a point that I think all potential entrepreneurs should read and heed.  He writes that having an IQ of 170 and being well educated will not be enough if you do not have the right instincts.  He, from his rich experience, knows that not everybody has the right instincts.  How refreshing.  Many other how-to-get-rich writers, for example, Suze Orman, seem to suggest that everyone can do well for themselves financially if only they learn to follow their instincts. <br />On page 52 Mr. Trump tells the reader to toot his own horn because nobody else will.  Anybody who has tried promoting anything knows how true that is.  And this book is another toot on Donald Trump's horn.  But that does not mean that some people cannot gain something from it.<br />I only recommend this book to entrepreneurs, and would-be entrepreneurs, who are ready to work long and hard like Donald Trump.  But before you buy this book take a look inside and you will see that it is actually a very small book.  Take out all the white (empty) space and all the photos (no advice to be gained from them), and the book shrinks significantly.  I don't want you to feel cheated by the relatively small quantity of words.<br />I only deduct one star because his stories are interesting, and the tips/advice leave me with an impression that I may have gained an insight that someday, somewhere, might help me make a correct financial decision.	2004-04-06

I would recommend it to anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of the modern world. The book does not have a narrow focus on just technology but also looks at technology's impact on society from many different and interesting angles. Most of what the author thinks we may expect to see on the road ahead of us seems like a very reasonable guess and he is in a good position to make an educated guess, but I think he perhaps underestimates by a bit the continuing pervasive influence of that ancient relic, TV! It is much more powerfull than the PC. For example, on page 263 Mr. Gates writes, \\"If people do gravitate to their own interests and withdraw from the broader world -- if weight lifters communicate only with other weight lifters, and Latvians choose to read only Latvian newspapers -- there is a risk that common experience and values will fall away.  Such xenophobia would have the effect of fragmenting societies.\\"  By this statement Bill Gates is suggesting that people who get their information about the world from Latvian newspapers may possibly become as narrow in their outlook as people whose only interest is weight lifting.   Weight lifters and Latvians?  There are many ways to make a point and this is an interesting choice by an active mind (I dare to guess that all Americans know what a weight lifter is and I know most don't know what a Latvian is, but I am glad the author did not chose an Austrian; that would be too obvious and the book would not seem as fresh and new without a Latvian in there). The risk that common experience and values will fall away is very small indeed. The spreading power of TV (cable etc.) will prevent that. TV is everywhere in homes (almost all), bars, airports, some dentists have you watch TV while you get drilled, travelers watch TV with breakfast in most motels/hotels and some motels/hotels have two TVs in every room.  That fanatical weight lifter and avid reader of Latvian newspapers both, like most people, probably cannot avoid watching TV, and have their world view, to a large degree, formed by CNN, CBS 60 Minutes, excellent commercials, Hollywood movies, and talk shows of all kind. Electrons radiating from the TV screen create a  bond between the weight lifter and the Latvian reader. A French man told me that the impact of TV is so great that French TV is even causing regional accents to fade away in France.   The next book Mr. Gates should write should be on how to make a very large and mature company's stock deliver superior performance to the long-suffering-and-not-so-patient-anymore shareholders. He should use GE's story as a guide. GE's great size did not prevent superior performance. But the book should be very short so that Mr. Gates can quickly start implementing the contents of the new book.	2004-04-06

Books	1	25	27	N	N	No one knows the future	At the very beginning of his book, on page 8, the author predicts that &quot;A major stock market crash will occur -- while hard to pinpoint an exact time -- it is inevitable.&quot;  But, truly, it is more than hard to pinpoint, it is impossible, isn't it?  He proves it in his book by not pinpointing anything at all.  <br />A forecaster who does not want to ever be proven wrong may give you an exact number or an exact date but never both.  Robert gives us neither.  He says there will be a major or massive stock market crash.  He does not say what massive or major means, down by 20%, 50%, or 90%? (as occurred at the time of the Great Depression).  <br />On page 43 he writes &quot;And millions will be out of money and off support after the year 2020, after this massive stock market crash occurs.&quot;  So the crash will occur anytime after 2020, could be 2030, 2050, 2080?  You get the picture.  We could try to pin him down and say that he is predicting that there won't be a massive stock market crash before 2020, but we really can't because if the stock market did actually crash before 2020 it will be up to Mr. K. to tell us whether it was massive and if his prediction was right or wrong.  Many professional financial advisors will tell you to run like crazy away from anyone who claims to know the future.  Mr. K. writes as if he has a special insight into what the future holds in store for us but is clever enough to avoid actually sticking his neck out.  Perhaps he remembers the economist who actually did predict a big crash in the 1990s.  Being dead wrong like that won't help book sales.  <br />I don't recommend this book because I think it is an attempt to sell his Rich Dad Poor Dad book again using fear and uncertainty as selling tools this time.	2004-04-03

On the whole this how-to book will I think help many readers start taking control of their finances, but I deduct one star because in the end her guidance puts too much of a burden on the reader's feelings.  On page 236 Suze writes that you will make money if you follow your &quot;instinctual response&quot; (she also calls it the little voice inside you and the voice of god).  But how do we know that her &quot;kiss-of-death&quot; clients at Merrill Lynch who always lost money were not making their decisions instinctually?  Is it beyond the realm of possibility that some people sometimes have an instinct for losing money? (perhaps they do not hear the voice of god properly).  I think it is wrong for Ms. Orman to leave these &quot;kiss-of-death&quot; clients with their instincts and feelings.  (I think it would be wrong for Ms. Orman to assume their decisions were based on nervousness etc. just because they lost money.)  She could have helped by asking them to surpress their instincts and feelings about when to buy and sell and told them to follow the lead of her other clients who made money (I assume almost all the time, because she says it was not a matter of luck for them), because they had the right &quot;spirit&quot;, &quot;attitude&quot;, and &quot;instinct&quot; for investment.  Or she should have at least told them to give up trying to time the market and put their money into indexed mutual funds.  Ms. Orman could have turned losers into winners.  I don't think that that would have been above and beyond the call of duty for a full service stock broker.  <br />This book would have been more valuable if she had told us more about her successful clients.  How did they develop the right &quot;attitude&quot;, &quot;spirit&quot;, and &quot;instinct&quot;?  Are they basing their buy and sell decisions on feelings, gut instincts, etc., or is there also a lot of analysis of data involved?  Also, I think it is misleading for her to write that it is not a matter of luckto make money for those people that have the correct instinctual response.  Most people would agree that Peter Lynch and Warren Buffet have good instincts for making money but both of them have lost money because at times they had bad luck or their good instincts failed them.  Suze ignores the element of luck in her book at the peril of her readers.  An investor with the best instincts who just bought before 9/11 would have made a big mistake, and a &quot;kiss-of-death&quot; investor who, by chance, for whatever reason, sold on that day would be by luck a winner.  The element of chance (luck) makes the real world more uncertain in the end than the one Ms. Orman portrays.  Just because you make a decision that reflects your instinctual response it will not always be the right answer for you because the element of luck has a much bigger role to play than Ms. Orman thinks.  Feeling good about things won't make them necessarily so.  Having good instincts is good, but you have to be lucky sometimes.	2004-04-02

Books	3	13	13	N	N	Rich in inspiration, poor in guidance!	This book could be dangerous to people who are easily inspired and have more determination than ability.  The author could actually pump up some people too much and cause them to do something foolish with their money.<BR>   To motivate the reader to go out there and make money the author tells about how he did it.  His money-making deals are incredibly successful and apparently accomplished with relative ease.  Readers who lack experience may get the wrong impression that great profits are easy to grasp only if you stop being lazy.<BR>   On page 190 the author relates a short story about a neighbor who bought a condo for $100,000 and the author bought an identical condo for $50,000.  This is fantastic, all in nice round numbers, and he got an apparent bargain for exactly 50% less.  This is the way to get rich.  Most people would love to make a buy like this.  (This is assuming the neighbor did not pay two times too much and real market value of the condo is only $50,000.)  But the author does not provide us with any details on how he managed to pull off this great deal.  What were his negotiating techniques?  What was the real estate market like?  What was the location?  Was the seller desperate, ignorant or stupid?  I have purchased eight condos myself and never managed to get a deal like that.  I know dozens of people who have bought condos and none are in that league.  We would all like to learn how to be like Mr. Kiyosaki but he does not give us any lessons learned on the details that really count.  On page 177 there is another example of a condo he bought for $50,000.  (I wonder why I can't ever buy a condo for such a nice round number?)  Wow!  Cynical/skeptical people may suspect some of his stories are partly or completely fictional!  But again, we are not told where, when and how he did it in detail that would be instructive.  Was it easy or difficult to do?  Could the average middle-class person do it?  Can the average middle-class person start thinking bigand acting like the founder of McDonald's (or Bill Gates) as he urges us to do?  <BR>   On page 81 the author states, &quot;The middle class buys liabilities they think are assets.&quot;  Is that not an insult to the greatest middle-class in the greatest country in the world? -- unless he has solidly researched data to support such a sweeping allegation.  If the intended audience of this book is the middle-class, and they are as ignorant as Mr. Kiyosaki thinks they are, I don't think this book will help get them from here to there.  The book has a lot of inspiration but is lacking essential, detailed &quot;how-to&quot; steps.  There is no detailed discussion on how to avoid the dangerous pitfalls along the way.  His answer is too simple: you just do it successfully like Mr. Kiyosaki and just learn to manage the risk.  There should have been more instruction/discussion on how to manage the great risk involved.<BR>   I only recommend this book for those people who can take it with a grain of salt.  I subtract one star for the lack of detailed guidance and another star for the insult delivered to the entire American middle-class.	2004-04-01

I can't believe that Clancy does not know the difference between the Baltics and the Balkans (see page 121).  I hope it is a big oversight or a super-sized typo.  Or could it be that Clancy is going to have the Serbs and the Croats who live in the Balkans go looking for oil in the Baltics where the Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians live?
