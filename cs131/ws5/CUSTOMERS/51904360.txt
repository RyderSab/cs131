And the tag lines on the front. Which all were the most amusing and interesting reads of this book. Probably because they weren't written by the author. I should have left well enough alone and left the book on the bookshelf where it certainly belongs. If this still doesn't convince you, go to the end of the book and read the author's bio, which he wrote himself. If you find it funny and hilarious, then this book's for you. I found it juvenile and sophmoric. As I did the book.	2005-07-21

After reading several of Rollins' previous novels (and raving enough about them to friends!), I started this novel off by thinking I was almost guaranteed a great read. Not so. The characters were insipid and uninspiring---I couldn't care less what happened to any of them---and the plot line was just plain ludicrious. While there is some suspension of belief needed as a requirement to his novels, this one went over and beyond acceptable levels. Buckyballs in the blood? Antimatter? Invisibility? And what happened to those terrific cliff-hanging chapter endings? This novel was a waste of time and money. BOOoooooooooring!	2005-05-21

Last week, I was in-between books, not knowing what to read, and went browsing through my bookshelf. I found a paperback I had bought some 20 years ago, never having read it. It was Woolrich's \\"The Black Curtain.\\" I was awe-struck. Not only with the plot, but his prose just jumped out at me. After years of Grishoms, Pattersons, Kings, Balduccis,and others, I realized that THIS was what a true genius writes! He uses words that you swear should never belong in some sentences, yet work. Of course, I then went to the library and read \\"I Married A Dead Man\\", which was even better. It was like reading a VERY suspenseful film noir script...only better. There is a quote on the cover of this book by Ray Bradbury that reads, \\"...Woolrich deserves to be discovered and rediscovered by each generation.\\" How true. If you've never read Woolrich's work, you owe it to yourself. And if you have, then you know what I write here is accurate.	2005-04-28

Or maybe &quot;was&quot; is a better word. Lately, they've been dwelling too much on serial killings, which I do not find entertaining at all. However, as far as this solo effort by Lincoln Child goes, it is a sham! The author should be embarrassed for writing this one. This story is old, hackneyed, uninspired and without any suspense whatsoever (the ending is easily guessable by page 50!). And yes, the ending... implausible and very, very far-fetched. But the big thing I'm beginning to notice about Child and Preston is their lack of character development lately. In their past few books, both individually and collectively, they have given us &quot;nil&quot; in this department, to the point where I couldn't care any less about the main characters since they don't give us the oportunity to get to know them! I HATE their Pendergast character for this very reason. They should drop him immediately! Honestly, do not ruin your lust for a good Preston/Child novel by reading this drivel. I suggest a good James Rollins or Matthew Reilly novel instead.	2004-07-08

If &quot;The Hot Zone&quot; scared the pants off of you, then this book will leave you naked. As an eastern Long Islander, this book really opened my eyes and made me think. With every chapter I read, I was on the phone soon afterwards telling my friends, &quot;And you know what else the government is doing there....&quot; The only reason I did not give this the full five stars was that it seemed to me in the last chapter that Mr. Carroll changed his stance on this issue. After an entire book of relating the nasty things that have happened on Plum Island---and ARE happening--Carroll suggests that perhaps Plum Island is needed. If this is his belief after all the research he did, then why wasn't that reflected in the rest of the book? Even so, I reccommend this book to anyone concerned about the health and safety of their neighborhood, particularly everyone living in the Long Island/Connecticut areas.	2004-06-27

But this novel, written about how a computer bug affects the life of its originator, wore me down. It is boring, dull, uninteresting, and plodding.

After reading his last two books before this one (The Christmas Train and Last Man Standing) I promised myself I would forever skip over any future books from him. I caved in. I gave him one another chance. A stupid move. Very stupid. About as stupid as this book. This book is so incredibly contrived and far-fetched, that I'm insulted that he would think we would buy into it even for a few evening's readings. Save yourself your time. Save yourself your money. But more importantly, save yourself the anger you'll experience after reading this book and realizing you were taken for an idiot. There are far better books out there to spend your time on.

And so, hearing the raves (although not from anyone I know personally), I went out and read this one. What a disappointment. The big flaw in this so-called thriller is that Brown doesn't let you in on the solution. He tells you only so much, giving you obscure clues that you could NEVER figure out, introducing clues at the last minute. And giving you an oh-so-pat ending that you feel like throwing the book across the room when you finish it. And the characters are incredibly dumb and unconvincing (a cryptologist that doesn't recognize DaVinci's backwards writing? Gimme a break!). Trust me: spend your time reading something more rewarding. Like, maybe, the National Enquirer?	2003-09-16

This book is AMAZING. Oh, sure, it's a check-your-brains-at-the-door kind of premise, but once you buy into it (and that's easy enough to do here!), you will be on the edge of your seat, turning pages quicker than ice melts in a BBQ. I love Rollins' style: he sets up one cliffhanger situation and suspends the tension over at least 3 or 4 other cliffhangers at the same time: he visits each  of them in time, but not until you're ready to scream  out, \\"I CAN'T STAND THE TENSION ANYMORE!\\" It's Indiana Jones in extreme.

I once read that if you put a group of monkeys in a room banging on typewriters, eventually they would come up with a novel. This must be that novel. I found it contrived, too pat, illogical and unbelieveable. Not to mention boring and uninteresting. It read like a grown-up Bobsey Twins novel. Amateurish.

As an avid reader, particularly of fiction thrillers, I have to reccommend this one without any reservations, despite the fact that it isn't fiction. It just reads like it. This is what defines the term \\"page-turner.\\" You just won't be able to put it down. I seriously doubt if this will ever be made into a film, considering the subject matter and how Vegas investors most likely have ties to the entertainment industry; but, it would make a GREAT suspense/action thriller. No, I take that back: it IS a great suspense/action thriller. My only beef, if I had to have one, is the somewhat weak ending. But then again, you can't really change the outcome of what is true, can you? Do yourself a HUGE favor and read this one. Out loud, preferrably, so your friends and family can enjoy it, too.	2003-04-26

After a long wait for a Trading Spaces book (the series in now in its third year!), when this book finally was announced, I expected it to be a companion piece to the tv show: a step-by-step how-to on some of the highlights of the show. It is not. Instead, they chose to give us photos and bios of each of the cast members, along with limited \\"tips and tricks.\\" And even at that, they failed to go the distance: I mean, com'on: aren't you the least bit curious to see what Hilde's home looks like??? Unfortunately, this book does not go that far.<br />Also, the look of this \\"book\\" is somewhat disappointing: it's more of a bound magazine. The layout is what I would call \\"retro 60s\\" and the flow is kind of rough on the eyes.<br />I wouldn't dismiss this book entirely, tho. For what it is (OK, so it isn't the book we all expected!), it is interesting and readable. They promise 2 more books come August, more along the line of the show. Let's hope these forthcoming books are more promising.	2003-03-13

His first books were fantasatic reads: Total Control probably being the best. But his Last Man Standing and, particularly this book, are just not worth the time or money. He's becoming the poor-man's John Grisham. This story was uninteresting, the characters flat and the situations unrealistic. And the writing very basic. But other than that, I have nothing to complain about. If you want a feel-good holiday book, treat yourself to last year's Skipping Christmas by  Grisham. Sadly, I think I've given up on Baldacci. This one was the deciding factor.	2002-12-31

I agree with one of the other reviewers: this is a GREAT looking book, filled with well-crafted photos. However, as a beginner woodworker, I was unable to follow most of the text. I thought this book would give step-by-step instructions on accomplishing various joinery solutions. Instead, it merely mentioned the solution and more or less told the reader to fumble his way through it himself. This may be a decent reference book for TYPES of joinery, but if you're looking for guidance in crafting the joints, you'll probably need other material to do so. What is also seriously lacking here is a glossary of terms used throughout the book to help the beginner understand exactly what the author is writing about.	2002-12-18

Most often, the novels are much better reads than those from seasoned pros. I suspect the reason to be that their first story has been rolling around inside their heads for some time before they decided to commit them to paper. And, that story is most-likely the REASON they become novelists. That's a shame with Ms. Glass' first time out: this attempt had little plot and no point. It doesn't give me much enthusiasm for any of her future endeavors. While this book was somewhat of a tough read (although I suspect the typeface used more the culprit than Ms. Glass' writing), Ms. Glass' is a good writer. At times, phrases and passages jump out at you, giving you false promise that the book will indeed redeem itself. It never does. What we need here is more plot and substance. Actually, we need a plot and substance. Sorry to break the four- and five-star ratings other reviewers gave this, but, quite frankly, I'm really sorry I wasted the time in reading this.	2002-07-20

And this latest book is no exception.<br />Reading this book, I had no idea where Mr. Cameron was going to take me. The characters are rich and the plot absorbing. And half-way through this read, I thought that wherever he would leave me really didn't matter. While the destination was awesome, my journey was equally satisfying. <br />I highly recommend this book (and any of Mr. Cameron's other ones as well). He writes so well. Using a minimum of words, he is able to tell the story so vividly, far better than a lot of other authors who use paragraphs upon paragraphs to describe a scene. There are writers who write stories, and then there are authors, such as Mr. Cameron, who write literature. <br />Don't miss this one!	2002-07-06

Finally, I read this one, not expecting too much from it, based solely on the subject matter. I figured as a single guy, I would not be able to relate very much. I was wrong. It is such a joy to read Mr. Bayard's writing. He leaves me constantly in awe as he describes people and objects with wit and a very keen eye. And the story, too, was very much a surprise.

This is by far not only Bad Balducci (which in itself wouldn't be too bad!), but also just plain bad.<br />At 550 pages, I wallowed along the first half of the book, determined to get through it. It suffered from TMC (&quot;Too Many Characters&quot;---you need a scorecard to keep track of them!) and FTMA (&quot;Far Too Many Anacroyns&quot;), which made the book extremely difficult to follow. At around the half-way mark, I decided to give Balducci two more chapters and then I'd call it quits. Well, suddenly, the book became somewhat of the standard Balducci I was anticipating: a semi-pageturner! But after it was all over, with an overly pat and predictable and too convenient ending, I was disappointed. I felt I had wasted my time. The book would have been much better if it came in at 200 pages less. This was a difficult read.	2001-12-14

I found I could not empathize with any of the characters; they seemed too stereotypical and self-serving. As far as plot goes, it was, at best, cute. It was adequately written, but I didn't find myself laughing or even cracking a smile while reading. There are no memorable lines; no amusing lines. It was a [very] mindless, light read. If you want to read a good book in this particular genre, there are plenty of other alternatives.

This book is a keeper, probably one of the best books of gay fiction I've read. While it was indeed tough to get into the book at first, as one reviewer commented, it was well worth the read. Once past the first few chapters, I wasn't able to put it down. It made me smile, and there were chapters in there (particularly when describing his brother-in-law poolside) that you wondered why it was in the book at all. But, afterward, the payoff was such that you were even tempted to reread these chapters over again, hoping to get the point once more. What I liked about this book was its celebration and acceptance of gay life from various perspectives, all not necessarily gay (for instance, from his Mother's point of view). This book will have you smiling, and wanting to remember particular lines, and jumping for joy. And maybe even give you a few good, happy tears at points. I would most assuredly recommend this book to anyone. A must read!	2001-01-05
