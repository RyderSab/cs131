I loved Reena's family and her interaction with Bo, but it was not necessary to take us that deep into the sewer-like mind of the murderer.  I also kept waiting for a twist at the end, sure that the murderer could not be that obvious, but it was.  Reluctantly, I have to say I was disappointed in this book.	2005-10-09

Also, after talking about the  Thanksgiving dinner for most of the book, I felt cheated that it wasn't written about.  A better ending would have been an epilogue with everyone gathered around the Thanksgiving table, enjoying the special relationship that they share with Eve and Roarke.	2005-07-15

They could have easily sliced 200 pages out of the middle and kept the story flowing.  Instead, many readers were doubtlessly turned off.

However, I found the book ridiculously far-fetched with the &quot;Sight&quot; business, and very historically inaccurate as well.  As a serious student of the Tudors, I found several laughable errors in this book, and though it is a work of historical fiction, such obvious errors do detract from the story.  The Other Boleyn Girl was a vastly superior work to this one, which seems like it was thrown together hastily to meet a deadline.  The ending seems to set up a sequel -- please Ms. Gregory, don't bother.	2004-02-25

I am on to the second book now, &quot;Stalking the Angel.&quot; Here's the reason for the title:  At the front of the book, a poem is quoted that reads <BR> &quot;Winter downpour<BR> Even the monkey<BR> Needs a raincoat&quot;<BR>             -Basho<br />I think this refers to Elvis providing the protection, a metaphorical &quot;raincoat&quot;, that his client needs in her time of distress, her emotional &quot;downpour.&quot; Or, maybe he just thought it was a cool poem!

Obviously, this book strikes a chord with Steel's own life experiences and I think that is what makes it so genuine.
