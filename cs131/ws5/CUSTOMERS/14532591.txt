To answer another reviewer's question: Yes, there are men out there who think this way and having Rob Winters be a policeman really made this book stressful. <br /> <br />Mary Grace was a textbook case of little self esteem, getting pregnant too young and looking for love.  Her love and protection for her son were awesome. I loved the fact that she hadnt even let another guy near her or her son, protecting only her child,  until she fell in love in Max.  A great many abuse cases seek another guy almost immediately and choose the same scum. <br /> <br />After working in the field so many years, I am sorry to say that I fully support the death penalty and that restraining orders are a waste of paper.   <br /> <br />Places like Hanover House have done magnificant work.  Loving homes and families are truly an answer to society's ills.  The one in this book proved to be one. <br /> <br />Time does indeed heal all wounds; you just have to live long enough to find that out. <br />	2005-10-06

OK the plot was implausible, but it kept me entertained on a long flight to a business meeting.   <br /> <br />This was my first read of DB and it certainly was action packed.  I rather liked Sean King, Michelle Maxwell and got a big kick out of Joan, the spider woman!!  <br /> <br />It certainly kept my interest (after acknowledging \\"hope this couldnt be real\\") and surprised me with a couple of twists and turns.  Will certainly try to find the next book which teams Sean and Michelle again as they form their own PI agency.  Hope the plot will be a little more realistic and not for the sake of an improbable wrong. <br />	2005-09-24

Here's a story within a story that is a bit distracting to get into. But, with a little perseverance, it hooks you after a while.  Again Jessie Arnold, altho pampering a recovering knee injury, agrees to help out at the Alaska State Fair with her beloved, Tank, at her side.  ( I want this dog!!!!) <br /> <br />A little boy, Danny and a Senior Assisted Living escapee (:D) meet and form a great alliance against the world!  Danny inadvertently picks up a backpack belonging to the bad guys and the story takes off from there.  Anxiety sets in when Tank is stolen as a hostage in order to get Jessie to return the backpack.  This is the tensest part of the book for me. The way Jessie and Tank meet again is gulping time. <br /> <br />Alex Jensen returns this time and it looks like he will hang around for a while.

Liked Annabelle right away, but had to reserve my feelings for Heath for a while.  The repartee between him and Annabelle was so amusing and different that I really got into this book easily. <br /> <br />I so enjoyed seeing Phoebe and Dan; Molly and Kevin and the children from SEP's previous stories once again.  I especially got a huge charge out of \\"Pippy\\" and her sweet affection for \\"Pwinze\\".  Laughed out loud at the Princess party. Been there, done that. It was just one good laugh after another. <br /> <br />I thought Bodie was HOT and respected his insight into Portia's angst even tho I raised an eyebrow or two! :D  Heath's version of Annabelle's family's treatment of her was an interpretation I was glad to accept.  All SEP's books end with a soft spirited conclusion.  Will anxiously await the next.	2005-09-06

Tension, delicious sarcasm, repartee, hunk of a hero and Clare is an angst ridden heroine.   <br /> <br />Several different side stories kind of keep you on your toes. Set in Arizona, this was not a boring book.  Emma and Beatrice are great!  Tony is awesome.  It has a few laughs and a pretty darn good mystery - diverting enuf that I almost didnt catch the killer until the end. <br /> <br />Several lawyers (Clare for one) in this book.  I work with a lot like them and can recognize that \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" is so hard a concept to accept sometimes.   <br /> <br />Am looking forward to LLM's Never Look Back, if I can find it.	2005-08-31

When a book title begins with \\"Murder at....\\" I know I am going to have a good time. Sort of reliving the old Nancy Drew days!!!    Sue Henry has written an able mystery again featuring Jessie Arnold.  Jessie gets a request from an old friend to help renovate the lighthouse they just bought.  In the process of getting to her destination, she does a good deed for a fellow traveler on the run from an abusive boyfriend.  The story takes off from there.    I have lost track of Sue Henry's books lately but intend to catch up soon.  The concept - Murder on a remote island with just a small circle of friends, one of whom is a killer.  Ms. Henry describes Alaska nicely, but praises Cruise West too highly.  I was not that impressed with CW on my vacation to Alaska.  I am sure it was a fluke, but the other descriptions were right on track.      Also as a fan of New England lighthouses, I was interested in the detailed description of the lighthouse and its history.  Ms Henry gets you right there into the action.    The ending, as well as the book, was not melodramatic. It was good to see that Tank, her faithful lead dog, is as devoted to Jessie as always, and that Alex Jensen is back in the picture.  Very pleasant read.	2005-08-30

This is the best Sandra Brown book I have ever read, and I've read most of them.   <br /> <br />Ben Tierney and Lilly Martin were outstanding and all the other characters were terrific! <br /> <br />Suspense, tension, 'did he or didnt he', passion were all involved. The setting was a whiteout snowstorm and it was portrayed chillingly!  Even in Florida, (am a former New Englander), I could feel the cold, experience all the emotions of the characters; and even tho you will probably guess who the bad guy is, you do not want to do it willingly!!! <br /> <br />This is a gut wrenching story, vividly done.  I read this book in one day - just could not put it down until I reached the end. <br /> <br />Each chapter ends hanging out there, and you rush thru the next to seek the answer! (boy, was I easy or what?) :D <br /> <br />Did not enjoy some of the last Sandra Brown books but this one has restored my faith.  Well done!	2005-08-27

First of all, altho this plot has been done before, the characters were developed enough so that the tension and repartee was the most enjoyable thing.   <br /> <br />River Road is a soap opera and Julia one of its sexiest stars.  When she is stalked, they hire a bodyguard (Finn Callahan) and things excalate from there.  I hope this story was meant to be funny because I laughed and groaned at the oh so corny soap opera.  I liked Julia a lot and of course, Ms Ross wrote Finn to die for! <br /> <br />The ending is very well written, very romantic but the road getting there was satisfying.  On to Nate's story.	2005-08-25

Formulaic in that there was a secret child and that they go at it hot and heavier than before. So much so that I found myself skimming over some of the episodes. (I cant believe I just typed that!!!!).    The ending was sweet but I have diffiuclty in how Matt received the news about Holly which was skimmed over like a night pass from Batman.

He endured, took a lot of hits, but survived it all.  And it all begins with a drunken college party!<br /><br />More characters in this book that you can shake a stick at and keeping them all in order takes a lot of concentration.

Alex Graham as Wonder Woman, getting her own way = a lot = and even bullying her Protector who is supposed to be a No. 1 warrior.  I admit IJ wrote him as a hunk and the dialogue between him and Alex was amusing, but you really had to bend reality and just enjoy the book.   <br /> <br />The only thing that disappointed, was the fact that we (and I hope this isnt too much of a spoiler) never experience the action when Morgan caught up with Runne to save Alex. After hearing throughtout the entire book and salivating how evil Runne was and what he intended to do to Alex in front of Morgan, it was somewhat of a disappointment not to be clinging to my chair, biting my nails, not answering the phone when I expected such a scary result. It seemed like I missed a few pages, when I really did not.  It was all tied up too quickly.  I guess I have to wait for Reacher's next book. :D <br /> <br />The Epilogue was very nice. (I am a romantic.) It's been a long time since I read one of IJ's books. I may try another.	2005-08-17

NIGHTSHADE: This is Boyd Fletcher's partner from Night Shift, Althea Grayson's story.  Her 'nemesis' is Colt Nightshade.  Their relationship is hot and heavy.  Lots of wonderful tension. He gets under her nails and then, she lets him.  Basic mystery story comes close to my profession of abuse counseling, and it was well done by Nora.  I am convinced that Althea is the prototype for Eve Dallas in Nora's J. D. Robb series.  It was fun recognizing the signs.  The story was very good. Nora sure knows how to write a love scene.    NIGHT SMOKE: This was Natalie's story and my least favorite of the four \\"Night Tales\\".  But it did bring back all the characters from the 3 previous stories.  The 'family' aspect of that is something I liked a lot.    I consider all of Nora's books Keepers.  They entertain and what more could you ask?	2005-08-15

You've read the premise and if the scientific stuff does not hold your interest, the chase will.  Sam and Haley are strong leads and the others follow from there.  A really bad guy gets your blood pressure going and the story is action-packed.  It might be a 'guy' book but this book got me thru a bumpy plane ride to Atlanta and back.  After reading about the crash in Toronto I needed a book to keep my mind absolutely occupied throughout the flight.    This book did the job and was very entertaining and exciting.

I did not become aware of Nora Roberts until 1995 with her J>D>Robb series.  These two stories were excellent.<br /><br />I noticed similarities in both stories to characters and situations in the \\"In Death\\" series, which began in 1995.<br /><br />Particularly, Night Shadow.  Gage Guthrie was probably the prototype for Roarke. Even Deborah's name was O'Roarke.  Gage's home, computer rooms and many of his lines were in incubation for Nora's new police procedurals.  Summerset is also present as Frank, Gage's major domo, who has a charming character all his own.<br /><br />I believe Eve was modeled after Althea in 'Night Shift'. She has her own story coming up soon. Either way, it was exciting to me that I discovered this similarity and I enjoyed these stories immensely.<br /><br />Night Shade and Night Smoke are being re-issued soon.  I will buy these and try to find more similarities; at the same time enjoying Nora's inventive and prolific mind.  Can you tell, I'm a real fan?  :D:D:D:D:D	2005-08-01

The Labrador was a hoot! I owned one many years ago and I think she came back as Boodles (McGuinn)!!  Skink and Twilly made a wonderful comedic team. All the 'characters' were very well developed.    Twilly was in the right church but the wrong pew!  His heart was in the right place and you can feel his frustration!

I was with them once again.     But that brat Brianna was not worth all the trouble Jaime and Claire went thru to have her! Then we have to put up with her smart mouth, lactation, and and her poor, unhappy, snotty baby.  What little there was of Jaime and Claire was pretty good. Hated seeing them get so old so fast, altho a child like Brianna would be the excuse she was an only child.    The book was much too long to endure and was anyone watching the editing?  I think I will re-read Outlander in preparation for Ms Gabaldon's next. Hopefully, it will be shorter and get to a point.

It was different and only the 3rd one of Ms Howard's with some sort of time travel.  The concept was interesting, but I really did not care for the hero and heroine all that much.  The story was very inventive and I appreciate Linda Howard's imagination.<br /><br />It really was not a 'could not put down' book until Chapter 16 when things come together and the chase builds.  The romance was sort of thrown in just to make sure it was there and Linda writes it well.<br /><br />It was the Epilogue that really sold it for me and it leaves you with a catch in your throat.

(I'm glad I moved South.) :D You could feel the cold as well as the chilling murders.  This book kept you on the edge until the chilling end! <br /> <br />Jenna was a nice heroine with two daughters who are going thru teenage angst and growing pains. Shane Carter was a hunky Sheriff.  Loved the interaction between Jenna and him. <br /> <br />The murders were creepy and the murderer, more so. A quick reading book. Never a dull moment.	2005-06-28

Jack Reacher is such an improbable hero, I love him to death!!!!! He's unbeatable and resilient!!! <br /> <br />The story hooks you from the very beginning and I always want to see how Jack Reacher turns up in the adventure.  After questioning the 'sniper' who asks them to find Jack Reacher, Reacher is found on South Beach in Miami with a Norwegian cruise chorus girl. Perfect!!!!! :D <br /> <br />Lee Child writes a tight storyline and your attention does not waver from side to side at any moment. Reacher gathers together a little clique to help him (including 2 women). The most interesting one is a former Marine named Cash who is one mighty big help to Reacher.  Their little banter when they meet was typical Army/Marine.   Hope to see this character in future novels. Enjoyed this book thru and thru. <br />	2005-06-26

Here is why Nora Roberts is so good at what she does. This lady can write a love story like no other.  Impulse was written in 1988 and still steamed off the pages.  A fantasy but what a fantasy. <br /> <br />The Best Mistake grabbed at your heart strings right off the bat. Wish every single Mom could find a guy like Coop.  Nora's description and character fill-out is marvelous. Laugh a little; cry a little.  This was a 1994 story and hit its mark.  <br /> <br />You wont be able to put it down.	2005-06-17

It took that long because I was on vacation and travelling from place to place.  A great story. I havent read Grisham for quite a while and this brought me back to the fold.    My heart went out to Nate O'Reilly (I'm a 'gooder'). I only wanted his salvation as did Rachel Lane.  In my business, I am not a fan of lawyers and it didnt get any better reading this book.  I wanted all the heirs and lawyers to get kicked in the (...).    For me, this was a page turner. I dont judge the specifics; just wanted a good story to hold my interest.  It did.	2005-06-10

Hero and Heroine nice enough people but the romance was lackluster. No passion!      The hit lady was interesting but you wondered her other torments at being raised by an alcoholic father.  Ultimately, she was a killer for the money.  Venues were interesting and familiar since I was in Holland last May.  I liked that I recognized places.      The Rapids was a good afternoon's read. A first for me from Carla Neggers.	2005-05-27

Final scenes were exciting and nail biting.  I found it a nice read and will definitely read another to see if this author can do it again for me. Perhaps I began his books too late in the Harry Bosch series. I hope not.	2005-05-24

I put it down time and time again. Unheard of! This story was so sophomoric I cannot believe Linda wrote it. But the Dedication gives a hint. A high maintenance friend who gave her the inspiration for the story.  <br /> <br />It was almost as bad as Janet Evanovich's co-written books. Awful! No way did it come close to her MacKenzie series. I did like \\"Cry No More\\". Wyatt just didnt do it for me this time. <br /> <br />Very disappointed.	2005-05-22

Hope I never run into him. <br /> <br />Overall, there was too much description of mundane things (feeding kids breakfast and dwelling too much on it) but overall a fairly good read. 'Gone for Good' and 'No Second Chance' were better but I will continue to read H.C. from time to time. Try Dennis Lehane also!!!	2005-05-15

He doesnt let you go for a second.

This personal achievement is a great little book to have on hand and a great gift to someone new to this country.  I know a few new American citizens that will have this as a gift shortly. <br /> <br />I even learned a few new tidbits that I didnt know before and I have lived in my beloved USA all my life.

Dug up my copy of One.....and sat down to enjoy all over.  <br /> <br />Just as funny the second time. Loved seeing the crew again. Ranger was great and Joe Morelli was SO good. The scene with Steph handcuffed to the bathtub and Ranger rescues her...... Ya gotta love it.  <br /> <br />This series is a hoot. All funny characters to be followed all the way thru. Just one good time! It's a feel good book without being sappy.  Waiting for her newest..... <br />	2005-05-08

Read in the paper that Ben Affleck is going to direct the movie of this book.  So I read it again. What a good writer Dennis Lehane is! All the characters (and they are characters) in his books are well described and their interactions are superb. Love Bubba! The mysteries are all good and the relationships are poignant. The aura of Boston neighborhoods was accurate and vivid. Mr. Lehane is a native of Massachusetts. Well done, Dennis!  (Hope Ben doesn't muck up the story).	2005-05-05

Anthony and Gail take his and her children and her mother for a visit to Anthony's Cuban father and sister.  Interesting tidbits here and there. Cuba is on the verge of change; Fidel Castro is almost 80.  It will be interesting.      The story was, as usual. one tense moment after another. Anthony and Gail are typical lawyers: She has to know every little detail and he lies like a rug!!!!     I think Ms Parker caught the Latin emotions (and they are volatile) well.  It's hard to put the book down.  But I am hoping her next \\"Suspicion of......\\" will take place back home.	2005-05-04

Trying to ignore the glaring mistakes of our military in all Lee Child's adventure stories, I have read every one of them and enjoyed them all. Being British, Lee prefers writing/criticizing U.S. military but that's OK and I can forgive the booboo's because the story is quick moving and he paints Reacher as quite a hunk! He's invincible and heals quickly! :D  <br /> <br />This prequel explains a lot about Reacher's motives and background. His family situation is so sad! And Joe, his brother, is somewhere deep in the Killing Floor.  <br /> <br />If you take this book as gospel, you will be disappointed. Just be glad you can recognize the miliary errors and just enjoy it as a good exciting read. <br /> <br />	2005-04-30

And this is one heck of a book to start with.  Action packed; one chill and thrill after another.  It has everything.

This one tugs at your heartstrings because Elvis Cole is a lovable, lost little boy.  A murder victim claims to have been his father and Elvis cannot let it go until he finds out the true identify of the victim. <br /> <br />Familar characters play a big part, expecially Carol Starkey, who makes my heart bleed for her.  Joe Pike could have had a bigger role but he is Elvis Cole's best friend, truly. <br /> <br />Elvis is still hung up on Lucie from another mystery.  I wish he would get over her. (It's the mother in me! :D) But she keeps turning up to squeeze his heart.   <br /> <br />Crais writes endings that will keep you turning pages.  His other books without Elvis Cole are good reads also.  This one is a keeper.	2005-03-27

I trudged thru this book.  It was drivel.  A 25 y.o. woman heading a corporation the size that it was??? Yikes, run for the hills.  This girl loved the abusive relationship she had to begin with then found a millionaire who took her in and trained HER to run his Corp?  Puleeze, even giving the benefit of the doubt, I would not believe this!<br /><br />And Cy, well, he should have imploded right after he and his mother ran Meredith out of town.  What a non-redeeming man he was and then at the end he 'saw the light'.<br /><br />This was a first Diana Palmer that I read, and I dont know if I can stand reading another one.  I cant wait to give this back to my neighbor and wonder why she would buy a book this bad.	2005-03-05

What a wonderful afternoon's read by the pool.  Dont ususally read about abused wives too often because it's too close to my profession, but this story was solid.<br /><br />Annie kills her so abusive husband in his final effort to break her into bits.  Of course a restraining order is only paper and thus fails to stop him in any way for long.  She goes to prison and asks her husband's cousin, Ramon, to raise the child.  Great choice and the guy turns out to be a Prince!!! He raises Tonio as his son along with running the Last Chance Ranch.<br /><br />Tonio's discovery that'Tanya' is his mother ends the book on a good feeling.  The notes she writes to her son at the beginning of each chapter are heart wrenching.  Mothers always have to make the sacrifices.<br /><br />This story ended happily; I wish they all could.	2005-03-01

Her LLoyd and Judy detectives are a sweet couple and compliment each other on the job.  But, as is a British habit, it is sooo intricate and involved and repetitive.  But you have to stick with it and it finally reaches some semblance of interest. <br /> <br />At the end of this novel, Lloyd and Judy are finally together again by being appointed to a special crime unit.  This alone should make for interesting reads.  Too bad their private lives are so mundane.	2005-02-17

At first it's a stretch to believe Joey Perrone was pushed off a 7 story deck of a cruise ship while in full sail and survived!!!!  But the more you get into the book, the more entertaining it is.  CH has a (...) sense of humor and I like that!!!!  Most of his sarcasms are just out loud funny.      My most favoirte character was Mick Stranahan and I would have liked more of him.  The others characters were a hoot: Tool, Red, Maureen - but Chaz I could have pushed off the Empire State Building and not missed a step. The man was in total denial!!!    This was a first read for me and I will look for others of Carl Hiaasons'.	2005-02-11
