The book is overdrawn. &quot;Eye of the World&quot; is a reasonably interesting book to read, if you can get past the Tolkien, Donaldson, and Star Wars takeoffs.                                         It starts off  with a naive character who, as soon as you've read the glossary will turn  out to be an &quot;anti-messiah&quot; (like an &quot;anti-hero&quot;).           He picks up more naive characters along the way.  A who would guess? He  is being hunted by Orcs and Nazgul...oops, I mean Trollocs and Myrrdrall.      Even though we don't get to &quot;see&quot; the Dark One (next on  &quot;Rehashed Fantasy Names&quot;...) he sounds interesting, but  &quot;Darkfriends&quot;? Please!           Anyway, here's the rundown: Rand  is Frodo/Luke Skywalker; the One Power? The Force, of course(wink,wink).  You see &quot; Farmboy with undiscovered powers of great depth is sought by  bad guy&quot;; Star Wars, anyone?                                      Moiraine? Gandalf/Obi-Wan; Lan, Aragorn; Mat, Perrin and Ewgene, Sam,  Pippin, and Merry. The Dark One, Sauron/Lord Foul/ Darth Vader/ The Emperor  (Shai'tan? Satan!).                       Too fluffy, and predictable. If  Jordan's next book is better, and the characters less naive, I will  certainly read it. Did like the relitively picturesque descriptions, but  shorten them down next time.	1999-09-20

Chapter after chapter, all the main character does is try to drown himself in self-pitying drivel. 90% of the cast of characters are sadistic psychos, and the terrible  &quot;aliens&quot; couldn't hurt a fly, much less conquer a planet. I mean  really, you never get to see them in person, and insect-like hive creatures  have great promise! I was expecting a book about a grown man who actually  does more than get picked on, wallow in self-pity, and play video games!  The book is more a view of &quot;What Earth Could Be&quot; ( horrible and  judgemental, kinda like Earth today), and is more fiction ( fantasy) than  science fiction, with a few starships and orbital space station throw in  for good measure. The part about Ender's sister and brother taking over  world via internet and public opinion is amusing, but unrealistic. I'm glad  I took this doozy out of the library and finished it in a day, rather than  buy this. I'm still going to try a few more of Card's book, but since this  is the first of his books I read, I'm rather unsure. Live long and prosper,  but for your own sake, don't read this book!	1999-08-15

The idea of a person born with strange telekintic powers is one that has been revisited many times. This book is most likely the most inventive variation.

OK, maybe that's a little extreme, but... This book is nothing but poor stereotypes and cliques. The Quavok (bad guys) are particularly annoying, I mean everything in their language starts with Q and that seems very  childish. The Q race was understandable because they have a comedy-  centered attitude. Janeway is constantly either thinking or talking about  coffee. Again, annoying! In fact, the first ten or so chapters ALL contain  references to coffee! This book makes Janeway out to be obsessed with  coffee. The aliens are stereotypical, the bad guys ugly reptiles, not like  in &quot;Seven of Nine&quot; or &quot;The Dragon's Honor&quot; where the  reptilian aliens are graceful, but deadly or so, and the good guys are the  unusually beautiful humans so common in the TOS trek series. Speaking of  Seven, in this book she lacks the depth and complexity her character  requires, and comes of sounding like the original Enterprise's monotonous  know-it-all computer.  And another recycled Voyager plot, the &quot;Oh no,  a terrible spatial anomaly threatens Voyager again!\\" like we don't get  enough of this from the TV show. The writing style is boring and childish.  If you want a good Voyager story, read  \\"The Black Shore\\" or \\"Ragnorok\\".	1999-06-27

Are Changlings possible?). And I think this is the book that said: &quot;The idea that a shapeshifter  like Odo would fall in love with a 'solid' like Kira is akin to human  falling maddily in love with a turnip.&quot; I agree, sorry Odo. And just  how did Odo turn into that ball of light when he was with Kira in a recent  episode? Matter into energy? KA-BANG!!! Goodbye, DS9! This book also  explains that so many &quot;human&quot; aliens is impossible. It also shows  why star trek is not my favorite show anymore because of these problems  (and repetitive storylines).	1999-06-15

This book is definatly one of the early sci-fi greats. The story takes place in the middle twenty-first century. The plot centers around a P.P. Corps &quot;conscience&quot; named Allan Odegaard whose job it is to survey  various potenitial colony planets for an overcrowded Earth, to find out if  any of the native spieces are sentient. His travels take him from the  frozen planet Sister to Crystal, a planet inhabited by silicon-based plant  lifeforms. On many of these planets, he encounters the &quot;New  Romans&quot;, a greedy, earthcentric political party who care nothing for  any of the alien races and who will not stop at anything to make sure  Odegaard is out of the way for good. One the most interesting of the alien  races are the Cryers of Crystal, beings who are one group mind, yet each  member of which is a separate, sentient entity. (If you want to see what  the Cryers look like, check out &quot;Barlowe's Guide to  Extraterrestrials&quot; by Wayne Barlowe.) This book, while risque at  times, is an excellent and interesting read, one that will keep you  engrossed till the end. Each planet is beautifully and painstakingly  described, and the enjoyment quality of the book makes you wonder what kind  of dolts the publishers were to let this book go out of print. This book  fully deserves five stars, and more. If you can find it, buy it! As it is,  I can only hope someone makes a movie based on this book (and does not ruin  the book in the process) so to cash in on the profits, some publisher will  be literally forced to reprint this book.	1999-06-11

Overall, the book is enjoyable, it is  fast-paced, but the storyline is rushed.Not one of these three authors'  best efforts.

This was the first star trek novel I had read in years, and I was enthralled with it! I took it on the train to New York, and was expecting to be disapointed (all because of Peter David,who usually fills  his star trek books with bad language and explicit material, esp.  &quot;Q-Squared&quot; ) but Rob Greenberger and Michael Jan Friedman seem  to be a good influence (I suspect that most of the good stuff was their  ideas). Incidentally, parts of this book, in fact the main theme, bear a  striking resemblance to the mvie &quot;Star Trek IX:Insurrection&quot;.The  two seperate storylines converge near the end, and during them, I was on  the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next. Also a good  book for Uhura fans, because she plays a major role, after all, the  chapters having to do with her make up half the book......This book will  keep you guessing till the final chapters,it will...did I mention that this  was a great book?	1999-05-16

This book was so good, I felt like hugging it at the end. Also, this book is most likely the main idea for so many of the star trek books that deal with the main characters having to undergo an &quot;age of ascention&quot;  ritual (for lack of a better word, sorry, Klingon fans)to achieve a  particular status that will solve their problems. It has a refreshing alien  spieces, much more interesting than the &quot;human&quot; aliens('sept for  the Romulans, of course), but, I must admit that I'm slightly partial,  since I love cats. Humorous at some times, this is a book that goes beyond  star trek. It's sad, touching, funny, about characters that are couragous,  believable, and sometimes stubborn. A unique view of beings that denied  their past,or tried to hide it, and how they finally, after millenia,  reunite and come to terms with themselves.This book delivers all that  without being profound or preachy. I don't have a single  &quot;favorite&quot; trek book, because there are so many good ones, so I  have a list:Janet Kagan,for &quot;Uhura's Song&quot; (drama/adventure);John  M. Ford,for &quot;How Much For Just the Planet?&quot; (hilairious comedy);  Diane Duane, for all her books; J.M. Dillard, for &quot;Demons&quot; and  &quot;Bloodthirst&quot; (thriller/suspense); A.C. Crispen,for  &quot;Yesterday's Son&quot; and &quot;A Time For Yesterday&quot;; and Gene  Deweese, for all his books. These authors are all good writers, so check  them out. And one last comment: &quot;Uhura's Song&quot; was Ms. Kagan's  first book, and it is monumentally better than some other trek authors'  books. Some author who have been writing for more than ten years, and are  still writing, like Peter David (urrgh!). Why didn't Pocket Books ask Ms.  Kagan to write more trek novels?	1999-05-16

There is only one word to descibe this book:BORING!!!This book was so boring that I almost didn't finish it.It rates at the top of my least favorite &quot;star trek&quot; books(right up there with  &quot;Crossroad&quot;)Stareing at cracks in the ceiling is more fun than  reading this book.	1999-04-23

Chapter 2:Shadows of  the Past(the most,in my opinion,unboring chapter in the book)	1999-04-23

A good book.Not really profound or anything,but a good,entertaing read.Plot:Geordi and Data stumble upon a intergalactic transporter,and in the blink of an eye,they are taken to a world where war has been  outlawed,and they(Data and Geordi)are treated like gods!The thing that  keeps war off is artifact called the &quot;Repository&quot; hovering over  the planet.The Repository is controlled by a madman,who keeps the peace by  forcing it on the populace.But unrest is stirring on the planet below,and  Geordi must figure out the secret of the Repository before one final war  breaks out!(Note:this about a star trek book.All the other reveiws on this  page are about a polictical thriller of the same name)	1999-04-20

This book really feels like the movies.Nonstop action and mystery are some of the very well written highlights.Some books seem really good from the synopsis on the back cover,but the inside's only half as good.Not this  book,it's good the whole way through(and it kind of reminds me of Alfred  Hichcock's movie &quot;Vertigo&quot; because of the way the main female  character tuns out to be evil and gets her comuppatence)But since it's so  engrossing,I would recommend reading this book on the plane to China,or a  long bus trip,because once you get into it,you won't want to get out!	1999-04-20

For those for you who like to wonder if anyone is out there,but don't want 90's UFO hokum,this book is the perfect choice.It's about a teenager who discovers that he's not what he seems to be.It all starts when he sees a  explosion through a telescope that no one else sees,then he dreams of a  train wreak before it happens.And a mysterious voice in his head keeps  whispering&quot;Zhypos 177&quot;.Soon he finds out that his parent aren't  really his parents,and men from the goverment start spying on him.Is he an  alien abductee,or a real alien?I picked this book up at a library book  sale,and at first i wasn't sure whether to get it or not,but boy,am I glad  I did!	1999-04-17

A great plot,a great storyline,but too much sex.Peter David seems to be having a constant problem with this.When I read star trek books,I am not interested in sex,I am interested in star trek.Sure,a passing comment or  two,but this book is littered with it!Also,there's too much of a soap opera  feel about it.The entire thing with the alternate Jack Crusher,Beverly,and  Picard is all fine and sweet,but NOT in a star trek novel!!!(actually,it  made me so bored that I skipped those parts,I mean get a life David!This is  not a romance novel!)Because of this,I devide the book in half:four stars  for plot,storyline,and so on,but zero stars for sex,soap opera-ishness,and  some gore.(If it wheren't for these,I would give the book five stars)Other  than that,this is a GREAT book.Trelane is fantastic villian,one of those  &quot;childlike guys with delusions of ganduor who get amazing powers that  make them go mad&quot; people,and I love how he seems to revel in his  maddness.Also,for once,Q is in a serious role!This seems impossible,but  David pulls it off just fine.But...as another reveiwer said:&quot;I was  hoping for something more G-rated.&quot;So kudos and boos to you,David.	1999-04-14

I was slightly disappointed with this novel.It seems to shift back and forth,from being overly brutal to extremly sentimental.It's one of those &quot;man vs. nature&quot; with a bit of genetical engineering thrown in.I  groaned when Comm. Stone found that his &quot;soul mate&quot; was a Wild  Thing.This is so typical of &quot;man vs. nature&quot; books.And it  definatly would have been more dramatic if Stone had died(yes,Picard and  Deanna would be staying about how strange yet amazing Stone was...but...).I  expected more from Peter David,who usually writes more interesting  things,but this IS a good book for Riker fans,as it shows some of his past  and explores his personnality,and that's why I decided to read it.	1999-04-13

Mr. Hawke,you've done it again!This book was totally fanastic!It kept me guessing till the very end!I kept wondering,&quot;what's going on here?Who's leading the crew of the Enterprise-D on this not-so-merry chase?Is it the the builders or the lost humans?&quot;One of the best  things about this book is where Riker keeps kicking that Romulan's butt.The  story is encredibly well written and the most interesting character was the  cocky know-it-all-about-humans Romulan commander.The only thing that  would've made this book better was if it had been set during the Original  Series timeline(I like Kirk and Spock  better)If any &quot;trek' book  deserves five stars,this one does. undoubtibly the best of the NextGen  books.	1999-04-12

The INCREDIBLE finale to an INCREDIBLE trilogy!The three Q books are definatly my favorite &quot;Star Trek&quot; books.0 is a fantastic villian,malevolent and theroly sadistic,just the way I like'em.His dark  ditties and great way Mr.Cox descibes 0's aloneness, almost(almost.)makes  you feel sorry for him.Cox also does a great job of showing a niave young  Q,and that even onipitant entities make mistakes.The creation of the  origins of Gorgan,the ONE(also known as a false&quot;God&quot;),(*),and the  Barrier are masterful.But best of all are the delightful nuances that Q and  Picard throw at each other.Even though novels are not considered  canon,these are for me ,at least until the Creators come up with better  canons. These books are so great,that this review doesn't do them  justice.So,to do them justice, read them.Of course, these books do have one  flaw.They end.	1999-03-28
