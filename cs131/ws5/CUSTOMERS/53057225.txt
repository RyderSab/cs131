The book is still fairly compact and it comes with an excellent biography and pointers to security software.	2004-04-05

It clearly shows that the author had 25 years of experience--not just as a designer of such worlds, but also as a user--to draw on, while at the same time being sufficiently detached from the industry to be able to offer candid opinions on any subject. <br />It's hard to think of anything on the subject that Bartle does not at least touch on (providing extensive, scholarly quality references to a wealth of further on- and offline materials), from the deepest metaphysical philosophy to the daily squabbles between users and administrators on virtual worlds large and small. Bartle does not in general provide cut-and-dried solutions to the world design issues, but he gives an extensive discussion of approaches attempted and how they succeeded and failed.<br />My only reservation with this otherwise excellent book was that I found some of the discussion a bit overly extensive. I would have preferred a book maybe 200 pages shorter, especially towards the final chapters of the book.<br />If you're planning on designing a virtual world, buying this book is more than just a good idea: Failing to do so would border on criminal negligence.	2003-10-15

It gives a solid introduction to the language and manages to introduce the necessary object oriented concepts along the way without boring readers who have prior OOP experience. It is also entertaining without being overly cute. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone with prior programming experience.	2003-08-15

However, I didn't really learn anything new and surprising from it either.<br />This book may have its place as a beginner's supplement to Meyer's _Effective C++_ books and Sutter's _Exceptional C++_ books. I wouldn't recommend it for advanced C++ programmers, though.	2003-08-15

This book is an outstanding companion volume to the Unicode standard. In fact, if you had to pick one, you'd quite possibly be better off owning this book INSTEAD of the standard. The author display an impressive knowledge of the world's writing systems and of the inner workings of the Unicode standardization process.<br />Part I of this book starts with the history of character encoding standards, from Morse code to today. It then presents a thorough review of the Unicode architecture and associated standards. The information presented was mostly excellent, although I found the section describing SCSU a little bit too sketchy (and the actual code in part III not entirely satisfactory to fill in the gaps).<br />Part II gives an overview of the various writing systems and character ranges represented in Unicode. Even for a nontechnical audience, this part would be fascinating with all the typographical and historical trivia it presents.<br />Part III discusses various algorithms applicable to text processing in a Unicode context. I must admit that I found this part a bit of a letdown. Many of the algoritms are only sketched out because discussing them in detail would be beyond the scope of the book. Quite possibly, the pages dedicated to these algorithms would have been better spent presenting examples of code using the various existing APIs for handling Unicode (Java, ICU, Perl, Windows, MacOS X).<br />This does not take away from the fact that this is a great book that any programmer interested in Unicode should own.	2003-08-07

Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />Although this book is clearly written for a popular audience and is dominated by ancedotes, some of which may be a bit overly cute, the author does a very good job differentiating between the pursuit of a healthy diet (which he wholeheartedly approves of) and the elevation of diet into an ideology or religion, which is what he warns against. He supports his arguments both with scientific evidence and with personal observations.<br />Among my acquaintances I see a wide variety of diet styles from junk food aficionados to health conscious eaters to allergen obsessed orthorexics, and I could see this book, with its truly holistic perspective in choosing a diet to maximize overall well-being, being of interest to all of them.	2003-07-22

The plot is compelling, the characters are fun, and the treatment of the various agencies and their motivations and bureaucratic techniques is nuanced (possibly based on Jewsbury's experience?).<br />Recommended for a pleasant long distance plane trip.	2003-04-22

The biggest, to me, were <br />- that somebody could predict years in advance that a court case would reach the Supreme Court. <br />- that the bad guys would try to kill people connected to the brief when precisely that would only reinforce the credibility of an otherwise rather far-fetched theory.<br />- that the protagonist is so reluctant about sharing her brief with the world, when disseminating it would be the easiest way of ensuring that killing her had no further value for the bad guys (and indeed, they run as soon as the story is finally published).<br />To compound these issues, the novel ends with essentially the same escapist ending as _The Firm_, the Grisham novel I'd read prior to this one.<br />However, despite all these weaknesses, this was an entertaining book that made for a fun 2 days of reading. As a further redeeming merit, Grisham had a surprising flash of brilliance when he equipped this novel (written in the early 1990s) with a dimwitted, hands-off, U.S. president, run by his handlers, whose interests were mainly playing golf, packing the Supreme Court with rabid right wingers, and doing favors to his cronies.	2003-04-18

It reminds me a bit of how early novels by Neal Stephenson used to end, or, as another reviewer here mentions, of the ending of Joe Haldeman's _Forever Free_.<br />Despite this weakness, this is a very entertaining book that I would recommend to any Science Fiction enthusiast.	2003-02-11

A considerable portion of it is spent talking about Windows specific APIs like DirectSound, and most of the examples use Windows event handling. It's probably hard to avoid the former issue, as there are no platform independent APIs for high quality sound, but many of the examples would not have suffered from being written using GLUT event handling. <br />Overall, the book is written in a sensible style that may be more accessible to some readers than the &quot;official&quot; OpenGL manuals. However, the areas that I had independent knowledge on (Math and Physics), I noticed numerous mistakes and sloppy reasoning, which may or may not extend to the areas that I can't verify independently.<br />Not overly valuable to me as a non-Windows programmer who has read the &quot;official&quot; tutorial volume, probably quite a bit more valuable to a Windows based programmer with little prior OpenGL experience.	2003-01-02

Part I gives a basic overview of the template mechanisms in C++ and part II goes into more detail on this. Part III applies templates to standard problems, while part IV covers more exotic uses of templates similar to what is discussed in Alexandrescu's _Modern C++ Design_. Even for a reasonably experienced template user like me, there were many details I learned even from the most fundamental part I.<br />This is a near perfect book (apart from a few apparent bugs in the code examples that hopefully will get corrected) that will greatly benefit any programmer who works with template based code.	2003-01-02

While I agree with his message, that lawyers and some other white collar workers enjoy enormous privileges of which they often are not particularly conscious, this message is here blurred by the fact that in this case, these privileges are justified by the shady activities the Firm engages in. Furthermore, after all his lamentations about his ill-gotten privileges, ultimately the protagonist opts for a life of wealthy retirement rather than working for the betterment of society (as opposed to, e.g., the protagonist of Grisham's later novel _The Street Lawyer_).<br />However, this flaw does not detract much from the reading enjoyment in this highly entertaining novel.	2002-07-22

From today's perspective, it appears that Miller may have overestimated both the self destructiveness of society and the eternalness of the church: Less than 10 years after this book was published, the church mostly dropped the use of Latin, so the book's frequent use of Latin must come across as rather quaint even to fervent catholics.<br />It's not clear to me to what extent this novel was intended to be an apologia for Catholicism. The church is portrayed as having a far more positive attitude to science than it had historically in the actual dark ages. Also, towards the end, the novel has a lengthy discussion of the church's position on voluntary euthanasia, which did not really seem all that relevant to the story (and which did not convert me to the Catholic viewpoint).<br />None of this should destract from the fact that this is a brilliant science fiction novel which I highly recommend.	2002-04-10

It might not even teach you all that much about particular algorithms (although Chapter 3 is one of the most detailed explanations of TeX's linebreaking algorithms published anywhere). Instead, this book offers a look behind the scenes. <br />Instead of beholding TeX and Metafont in their almost final versions, as published in _TeX: The Program_ and _Metafont: The Program_, respectively, you see them grow from the first design studies (when Knuth thought of TeX as a program for two grad students to write over a summer) to where they are today. You see how the collaboration between Knuth and Zapf on the Euler fonts worked, and you get another glance at many facets of Knuth's mind (And a beautiful mind it is indeed, even though it is entirely sane).<br />If you have any deeper interest in TeX and Metafont, this book is well worth the money.	2002-03-23

It gives a pretty good assessment of what your chances are in each situation and advises you in your legal strategy. However, I recommend that you also attend a session of traffic court to see the system in operation for yourself. Doing that, I noticed that: <br />1) Not all officers showed up, but those that did were very well prepared and articulate.<BR>2) Expect both the officer and the judge to know this book as well or better as you do. <BR>3) The judge was willing to give some leeway on the fine amounts, but none on questions of guilt.<BR>4) Even if you win, you'll probably have spent a lot more time fighting your case than you saved with speeding in the first place.<br />This does not detract from the fact that this is a very useful book.

Any C++ programmer could almost blindly pick up any book in the series and learn some new valuable insights.<br />I like &quot;More Exceptional C++&quot; even more than the original.  It's not clear to me whether this is because the book is better or because the subject matter has become more important to me. The &quot;Exceptional C++&quot; series is shaping up to be a big brother to the &quot;Effective C++&quot; series, covering areas somewhat more advanced than those in the Effective series, such as exceptions, templates, and namespaces.<br />One aspect of the book I don't particularly care for is the quizzes/points format that, I suspect, is due to the origins of the book in the author's &quot;Guru of the Week&quot; series.<br />This is a great book and should belong in every advanced C++ programmer's personal library.	2002-02-01

However, I can't help thinking that those novel insights could easily have been packaged in a 30-50 page journal article, instead of padding them into a 320 page book. <br />It's not clear to me what audience this book is targetting. Presumably, one would have to be a fairly sophisticated system administrator to make use of the information obtained by setting up one's own honeynet. For such an audience, however, much of the information presented seems to be at too elementary a level.<br />The authors don't help their case with their constant boasting of their own sophistication and their gratuitous use of military metaphors. The technical side of internet security is still better served by Cheswick and Bellovin's _Firewalls and Internet Security_ and Garfinkel and Spafford's _Practical Unix Security_, despite the age of those books. If you're interested in the social side, you'll be better entertained by Stoll's _Cuckoo's Egg_ or Shimomura and Markoff's _Takedown_. <br />I can't recommend this book very highly, but the bundled CD appears to be quite useful, so if you have the money to spare, you might give it a try.	2002-01-28

Having had some previous exposure to FP, I found it very slow going, with tediously long discussion of trivial toy examples.<br />Aggravating these flaws is the typography, which is not just ugly, but dysfunctional: The font used for the unnumbered section headers is not sufficiently distinguished from the text font, so it is impossible to skip over the examples to new material being discussed.	2001-12-31

It showcases some of Stephenson's skills, such as his three word demograpic characterizations (DEBT-HOUNDED WAGE SLAVE) and his obvious empaty with the thought processes of engineers, while improving on some of the flaws he had at the time this was written (Especially his inability to write decent endings). The plot is fairly disciplined and straightforward, while I prefer the more chaotic style of his cyberpunk novels. In an effort to write a more mainstream thriller, Stephenson seemed to have toned down his outrageous humor considerably for this novel, although there are still some very funny moments.	2001-12-31

Nevertheless, I found this book fascinating. Its form lends itself very well to casual reading, as each of the patterns is only a few pages long. <br />Some of the patterns give great explanations of why some of the structures I live in every day don't work all that well (in Silicon Valley, you can find more or less every pattern in the book violated, some of them pervasively so). Other patterns exmplain why some of the structures *do* work. Yet other patterns are thought provoking, even though I don't agree with them  (Would I want to have an outhouse instead of a bathroom and compost its products myself? I don't think so. Does Alexander have an outhouse for his own house?). <br />I recommend this book highly.	2001-12-14

I was not familiar with his work previously, and this book shows why he was a successfuly columnist: In each of his 4-6 page chapters, he successfully drives a particular point home.<br />This book is probably not suitable as a text book for any particular topic, but it can get your thought process in various disciplines started. Since the chapters are very short and independent, it is ideally suited as bathroom or bedside reading material. What works a bit to the detriment of this strategy is that the chapters are sorted by topic; counterintuitive as this may sound, in a book like this, I would prefer for the topics to be mixed up.<br />A slight peeve is the unsealed paper binding of this book, which smudges easily. I hope publishers are reconsidering their use of this binding, which seems to be on the increase.	2001-10-29

Even for me as a nonnative speaker, the language was not too difficult, even if I dinnae want me bairns to pick it up. I disagree that the novel would work as well or better if it were written in &quot;proper English&quot;. Like some other authors (e.g. Franz Xaver Kroetz in German), Welsh derives some of his power from the interplay of &quot;proper&quot; language and dialect.<br />Overall, I did not find his novel as enjoyable as _Trainspotting_, Welsh's best known (and, in my opinion, his best) novel. On the other hand, one quality of _Glue_ that _Trainspotting_ does not have is the long term portrait: Instead of a snaphot of hooligan/junkie life, you get to see where these young men and women come from, how their attitudes change over time, and how their life choices play out some years later.	2001-10-29

This in itself is a useful service if you (like me) prefer printed documentation over online documentation.<br />However, I was disappointed by the fact that the book does not go beyond the manual pages by providing more complete programming examples. Also, I would have appreciated seeing some of the excellent academic papers that exist about the algorithmic underpinnings included in the book.<br />As a final complaint, the book employs an increasingly popular binding style of using some sort of unsealed paper for binding. While I'm all for ecological packaging, I found that this style of binding (especially with a predominantly white cover) tends to take fingerprints and other smudges very easily, and makes it hard to remove them. As a result, the book starts looking ugly quite soon.	2001-09-20

The book's main message seems to be to promote science and rationalism against superstition and sociobabble. Egan's scenes featuring postmodern sociologists Keith and Anita are the high points in the book:<br /> &quot;Well, I'd already done a Ph.D. in X-Files Theory at UCLA, and Anita was just starting her Master's in Diana Studies with the University of Leeds, via the net. U Toronto was in the process of opening its own Department of Transgressive Discourseat last!so it was only natural that we both applied for positions.&quot;<br />Unfortunately, the book severely undermines that message with a weak ending that essentially asks the reader conditioned to rationalism to take a denouement full of biobabble on faith.<br />While I wouldn't hesitate to highly recommend any other novel by Egan, I cannot recommend this one.	2001-08-18

I felt that, as opposed to Scott Meyers' books and the original _Design Patterns_ book, many of the techniques presented in this book are the result of research into &quot;elegant&quot; solutions rather than experience with what really works in practical applications.<br />I really liked chapter 1 discussing policy-based class design, chapter 2 discussing various template techniques, chapter 6 discussing singleton implementation, anbd chapter 7 discussing smart pointers.  Chapter 11 discussing multimethods, appears to be a good discussion of various alternatives but I'm not inclined to use multimethods anytime soon. <br />Chapter 3 about typelists is interesting, but after all the dazzling manipulations, all that typelists seem to be good for is generating class hierarchies, which I didn't find very compelling - it looks as if the typelists help to manage complexity that possibly wouldn't be there if the typelists hadn't been used in the first place.<br />Chapter 4 about small object allocation was of limited interest to me. The other chapters, 5 (Functors), 8 (Object Factories), 9 (Abstract Factory), and 10 (Visitor) offered fairly complex, template based solutions that to me did not look obviously superior to the straightforward manual implementations shown in _Design Patterns_.<br />Overall, a stimulating book, but one whose recipes will need careful evaluation before use.	2001-07-14

Parnas	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Excellent Collection of Thought Provoking Material	A great collection of papers showing a wide range of Parnas' thinking, on mathematical subjects, on the software engineering subjects he is best known for professionally, and on matters of personal and professional responsibility (like his views against SDI, which have become of increased relevance again).<br />I would not necessarily recommend this book to somebody who is looking for concrete and comprehensive answers to some pressing problem. Rather, the book is an opportunity to glimpse into the thinking of an extraordinary researcher and to pick up some useful professional insights along the way (similar to Knuths' _Selected Papers on ..._ series or Dijkstra's  _Selected Writings on Computing_).<br />In reading the software engineering papers, I was particularly impressed with Parnas' formal, yet utterly pragmatic use of math (as opposed to the mathematical showboating common in the program verification literature). <br />The book also adds a lot of context to Parnas' stand on SDI, showing that he was, in general, more than willing to work on military (and nuclear) projects. <br />A delightful read, only slightly blemished by a somewhat excessive number of errata (which, I believe, are fair game to criticize in a book dedicated to software quality).	2001-06-18

I liked the first edition for its case studies of edgy systems like Mach and Amoeba and was quite surprised to see them gone in this edition. Apparently, due to the expanding size of the overall material, Tanenbaum is only covering these in his Distributed Systems books anymore, and the case studies left in this book are UNIX and Windows 2000, OSes that I would classify as &quot;contemporary&quot; rather than &quot;modern&quot;. Also, I was very disappointed not to find a single mention of MacOS X in the book.<br />Still, this is a superb book. It covers a wide range of material, and ties textbook material to the latest research papers in an area (for its literature survey value alone, this is a great starting point for any in-depth study of an OS topic). Tanenbaum also suffuses all of the material with humorous anecdotes and sly asides which make the book a delight to read cover to cover.	2001-06-08

Ever since its first edition, this book has managed to strike a healthy balance between tutorial and reference material (the latter aided by a superb index, a feature sadly deficient in many books).<br />Is this hardcover edition worth the extra price over the softcover 3rd edition? In my opinion, it is! As far as I can tell, the contents are nearly identical, except for two extra appendixes which are available for free on the web. However, for a book that one is likely to use as intensely as this one, the hardcover binding and especially the attached bookmark threads are very convenient.	2001-06-05

I'm myself an avid player of chess and several other games, and this is the best literary portrait of a game player I've ever come across.

I'm happy to report that this book contains an answer to a considerable part of my prayers: It contains an in-depth discussion of the STL, along with a complete, high quality implementation in source code form (Contrary to what the &quot;Topics Covered&quot; section on this page implies, however, the source code is NOT the Hewlett-Packard implementation, but a proprietary derivative which is commercially licensed).<br />It's hard to pin down exactly why, but this book was not quite as pleasurable a read as its predecessors. One of the reasons might be the typography: The use of underlining for emphasis of the actual makes the standards sections of the book unpleasant to read. There might be an issue of the subject: For all its power, there is not all that much interesting algorithmic stuff going on in the STL. Lastly, it seems that C++ template code as such, no matter how brilliantly written and how useful to the library client,  is rather unpleasant  to read-a somewhat sobering insight to a C++ aficionado as myself. As a result, the code that *was* algorithmically interesting was quite hard to understand-I would not recommend this book to somebody trying to learn about red-black trees, for instance.<br />If you buy just one book about the STL, buy Josuttis' _The Standard C++ Library_. If you want additional in-depth insight into the workings of the STL, and are willing to invest the time it takes to study the code, buy this book. I certainly never regretted reading it, and I hope that Plauger will update his implementation of the rest of the C++ library to publish a standard compliant version of the iostream and string libraries sometime in the future.	2001-04-05

Unfortunately, Heinlein seems to have very little use for the actual *exercise* of the citizenship: His characters refer to it on derogatory terms, all of them get killed or become career soldiers rather than voting citizens, and none of them evidences the slightest interest in actually *changing* anything in this oh-so-perfect society.<br />Instead, we get treated to a view of a society which constantly brutalizes its members from childhood through military training to their slaughter in poorly motivated military tactics and to justify it all, harangues them in regular indoctrination lectures. Blatantly taking a page out of the Nazi playbook, the instructors keep referring to their poorly reasoned apologies for their brutal ideology as &quot;exact science&quot; and &quot;mathematics&quot; -  with such a perverse use of &quot;mathematics&quot;, it's no wonder that the protagonist keeps having difficulties in his math studies.<br />Recommending the book for a &quot;young adult&quot; audience is a bad idea. Like Ayn Rand's _Atlas Shrugged_, another work of fascist science fiction, it's bound to poison impressionable minds with a pseudo-philosophy that it's going to take them years to grow out of. It might be interesting, however, to present this book in combination with two other books: Joe Haldemann's _The Forever War_, which presents a much more plausible scenario of the effects of intergalactic war on soldiers and society, and Hans Peter Richter's  _I Was There_, an autobiographical account of what it's *actually* like to grow up in a fascist society (Nazi Germany; readers of _I Was There_ will find a chilling similarity to the society of _Startship Troopers_).<br />Leaving aside the disturbing ideology (which is rather hard to do), the book is reasonably well written (which is why I gave it 2 stars), except for the dialogue, which is suprisingly wooden for such an acclaimed author.eology (which is rather hard to do), the book is reasonably well written (which is why I gave it 2 stars), except for the dialogue, which is suprisingly wooden for such an acclaimed author.	2001-03-05

It's certainly amusing enough and should be a big hit among geeks, and the weaknesses the book has are not all that much worse than what Stephenson's other books prior to _Cryptonomicon_ suffered from.<br />Somewhat reminiscent of Matt Ruff's _Fool on the Hill_, _The Big U_ is set around dueling subcultures in an university setting. Characteristic for Stephenson, we get technological implausibilities instead of Ruff's magical realism, the characters have plenty of attitude and a good deal of senseless violence, and the geek subculture is lovingly portrayed.<br />Like many of Stephenson's novels, the end of _The Bug U_ is not quite as brilliant as the beginning. Also, the first person narrator is not one of the strong points of the book. Still, this is overall a highly amusing book and strongly recommended if you liked any other Stephenson novel.	2001-02-21

Although it turned out rather unsuitable for this purpose, I found much to recommend in it: It presents Dr. Athens' interesting theories in an accessible, but not trivializing form and relates them to the youth experiences of both Dr. Athens and the author.<br />There were several aspects of the book I don't like.<br />The author appears to have added considerable speculation beyond the actual academic work of Dr. Athens he discusses (At 340 pages, Rhodes' book is actually quite a bit longer than the two books that Athens has published *combined*). Rather than enhancing the credibility of Dr. Athens' approach, Rhodes' attempts to fit various high profile criminals, ethnicities, and the Vietnam war into Athens' theoretical framework do a disservice to the theory, making the reader wonder whether such a treatment of facts is really based on a viable methodology, or rather a narrative slight of hand.<br />Secondly, the insistence on a single cause for violent crime is highly implausible. Even though the effect of mental illness and drug use on crime may be overstated, surely it does contribute to *some* crimes. In some ways, Rhodes' insistence on &quot;violentization&quot; as the sole cause for US atrocities in Vietnam resembles Daniel Goldhagen's theory (in _Hitler's Willing Executioners_) of antisemitism as the sole cause for German atrocities in WWII, and similarly can be seen as somewhat myoptic.<br />Lastly, Rhodes' (and, it seems, Athens') assertion that violentization, once complete, is always irreversible, does not seem to be supported by as much factual evidence as the description of the violentization process itself (and, indeed, it would be hard to prove the assertion, given that it asserts an universal negative). In fact, there seems to be evidence the other way in Leon 'Whitey' Thompson's autobiographies _Rock Hard_ and _Alcatraz Merry-go-Round_: Although by the time Thompson arrived in Alcatraz, he was a poster child for Athens' &quot;violentization&quot;, he appears to have gradually mellowed out over subsequent decades and seems to have been a peaceful citizen for at least 15 years now. <br />Still, the book is worth reading. It presents an interesting and valuable contribution to an important debate, and I did not find its policy recommendations as conservatively biased as other reviewers have seen them.	2001-01-05

They try to escape their situation by skipping history for a few thousand years.<br />So far so good, and maybe it's a good idea that the author doesn't let them succeed in this project - I don't blame him for having no clear idea what sort of society the time travelers would find on their return, and even a well executed novel along these lines would appear to be overly derivative of _The Forever War_.<br />The alternative that Haldeman offers, however - literally a &quot;deus ex machina&quot; - was pretty unsatisfactory and ultimately left me disappointed in the book.	2000-12-27

If you've been around in the Gibson universes of _Virtual Light_ and _Idoru_, which are tied together here, this book is an enjoyable enough read. However, it does not measure up to the rest of Gibson's work. If you want action and attitude, you're better served with the _Neuromancer_ trilogy, if you want communities, you're better off with _Virtual Light_ or _Idoru_. <br />_All Tomorrow's Parties_ shows the communities of the two previous novels in decay: The physical community of the bridge is assaulted by commercialism, anarchy, and sabotage. The virtual communities of _Idoru_ are devolving into people calling each other on cell phones and hiding behind virtual representations. The book does not have much of an intelligible plot, leaving the characters mostly just as confused as the readers.<br />This does not mean that _All Tomorrow's Parties_ is entirely without redeeming qualities. Gibson still has a great eye for character and scene descriptions and dialogue, and his (somewhat autobiographical) references to watch collecting and auction sites show maybe the first glimpse of modern technology in Gibson's work that the author actually uses himself.	2000-12-06

Pandolfini does a reasonable job picking positions to diagram. However, at least to me as a reasonably experienced, if mediocre, chess player, the author's analysis was entirely worthless.<br />Clearly, Pandolfiini's intention was to use this high profile match to teach some general principles of chess to an inexperienced public. I'm not sure this is a viable strategy, given at what high level the games were played, but there is nothing wrong with the principles the author teaches. However, In his attempt to cater to the chess novice,  Pandolfini goes overboard in avoiding the discussion of any but the most obvious lines. As a result, the somewhat more experienced reader is left without help to the somewhat less obvious questions.<br />As a glaring example of this, it would have been well worth a discussion, giving specific lines, why the black position at the end of game 6 is indeed lost. Instead, Pandolfiini just states some generalities (&quot;Time to buy IBM stock&quot;).<br />Furthermore, the book is utterly disappointing in its failure to provide any substantial information at all about the technology behind Deep Blue, instead of the clichés that the author seems to find amusing.	2000-11-27

One  of the chapters was titled &quot;A Trivial Algorithm Whose Analysis  Isn't&quot;, and this probably sums up why I'm not entirely enthusiastic  about this book and about the field of algorithm analysis in  general.<br />Knuth wouldn't be Knuth if he didn't throw some lighter material  in as well, and chapter 2, &quot;The Dangers of Computer Science  Theory&quot;, was quite amusing.	2000-09-06

In the end, he comes away with  a deal that is convenient for him, though neither particularly realistic  nor of any benefit to anybody else.<br />Despite all of this, this book would  not really be all that odious - the world needs a supply of shallow books,  and writers like Heffernan have every right to make a living off writing  them - if  it didn't promise to discuss a very real and serious problem -  downsizing - and so utterly reneged on that promise.	2000-08-22

His central insight seems to be that if your life spans  thousands of years of planetary time and hundreds of planets, you're bound  to have a very different outlook on life than planet-bound, real-time  beings. In contrast, the aliens, being planet-bound and gifted with a quite  limited lifespan, seem very human in their intensity to accomplish  something in their lifetime.<br />The book is an excellent read, but it does  seem a bit too long.

However, it cannot compare to its predecessor, _The Silence of the Lambs_. Harris has  spoiled the combination of traits that made _Silence_ so successful by  blowing up each element to grotesque proportions:<br />Lecter's erudition has  been elevated onto the level of an Umberto Eco protagonist, combined with  the refined and expensive tastes that make Carl Djerassi's heroes so  annoying. The childhood traumas that shape many of the protagonists have  increased to a level that would make Andrew Vachss shudder. The subtle, but  constant power and gender struggles that Starling has to fight in _Silence_  have been replaced by an all-out, Rambo-style &quot;One person against a  corrupt system&quot; war, and the latent erotic tension between Starling  and Lecter in _Silence_ turn into a bodice-ripper in _Hannibal_ (Mad  Scientist Ravishes Beautiful FBI Agent! Film at 11!).<br />Now all of these  styles (and I'm sorry if this sounded like a shopping list) of course work  perfectly fine by themselves, but the way Harris combined them in  _Hannibal_ simply doesn't work that well for me.

Nevertheless, this novel feels like a more mature work in  several aspects: It's the first novel by Stephenson that has a halfway  decently written ending, the characters are reasonably aware and afraid of  their mortality, and the writing in some scenes borders on the subtle (e.g.  when Turing comes on to the elder Waterhouse).<br />The plot, some sort of  combination of Pynchon's &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot;, Buchheim's  &quot;Das Boot&quot;, and a stack of WIRED magazines, starts off as a  somewhat slow read but becomes more and more compelling. <br />The core idea  which the book explores is the interaction of the world of information and  the world of physical interaction -- bitspace vs. meatspace, and Stephenson  resists the temptation to facilely declare (as many a WIRED author would)  that meatspace &quot;has become irrelevant&quot;, nor (as people like  Clifford Stoll would) that bitspace &quot;is not real&quot;. Rather, he  shows that interactions go both ways: Decrypted bits *do* sink ships; a few  corrupt cops  *can* seriously cramp the style of a hacker cruising  cyberspace.	2000-08-10
