Of the 3 this is by far the weakest offering---though BLEACHERS wasn't far behind. It reads like WALL STREET goes VARSITY BLUES. The tapestry of the 2 disparate stories in this novel was never woven properly so that each storyline is an intrusion on the other and leaves you trying to find how we went from the boardroom to the 50 yard line at the Packers game.	2003-11-15
US	35241274	RO884QMJND8WE	0670031747	572148711	Elvis Presley (Penguin Lives)	Books	1	7	19	N	N	Bereft	When these publishing houses reach into the shallow end of the writing pool to assign authors the task of patching together a novella, this is the inevitable pitiful result. Superficiality overflows her perspectives, and the style of the book is forced, as she tries to spin a tome of the south as a tapestry into Elvis' life. I must've been absent from the planet during the minute that Elvis' career took this downward spiral she focuses on. Recently he has had the number 1 song and album in the world, which went gold or platinum in 60 countries. 15,000,000 people from around the world have stopped by his house over the last 20 years, making Graceland the most visited home in the world (next to the White House which is a public building); there are over 700 fan clubs; he has sold more records since 1977 than any 3 acts combined; his posthumous concert tour breaks attendance records around the world, and a whole new generation of children have discovered him in the Lilo & Stitch movie. There are still more books sold and written about Elvis than any other artist. He was voted the \\"Artist of the Century\\" the 57th \\"Most Influential Person of the Millennium,\\" and his song, \\"That's All Right Mama\\" was chosen by CNN as the \\"Song That Changed The World.\\" He revolutionized, Radio, Concerts, the Record Industry, the Music Charts, Television, Movies, Pop Culture, Male Sexuality and fan devotion. He first created the generation gap in the 50s and bridged it in the 70s. Without Elvis crossing over to open the portal for Black entertainers, Motown would've been a regional success only. After 9/11 when the world sought emotional comfort through songs of inspiration and patriotism, \\"America The Beautiful\\" sung by Elvis in 1972, went up the Top 10 charts worldwide. A man that accomplished all this in just 22 years---so much that his work and image still dominate the perlieu 26 years after his demise--- deserves better than to be written about by an author of the ilk of a Bobbie Ann Mason. <BR>P.S He is releasing another album, that will be pushed to the top by another Number 1 single.	2003-09-09
US	35241274	R3BUNIBAH3HZG	0970833253	871483055	Around Elvis	Books	5	1	1	N	N	ELVIS FOR EVERYONE	Thorne Peters once again proves that he is the \\"Undiscovered Country\\" of literature. In his first non fiction novel, he successfully switches from his dialogue-driven style and writes an articulate narrative, while telling his tale from an intimate insider's perspective. Thorne is seemingly able to access the thoughts of Elvis Presley and explains his quirks and downfalls in a way that humanizes him rather than villifies him. As a fan club president, Thorne obviously has a strong love for The King, so many of the passages are cathartic and personal. A whole new cast of characters emerge that were \\"Around Elvis\\" in one way or another and Thorne tells their tale with just as much care. Thorne writes of the community of Whitehaven and its citizens like a fictiontional town, so it has a modern day Twainesque feel. He artfully takes the reader up the driveway of Graceland with the children on their bikes, and into the Magnolia trees in the churchyard next to Graceland where the kids would climb up and look over the Great Wall of Whitehaven . . . even jump over the wall, and a couple times take a dare to jump into the pool. Thorne puts the reader there when Elvis stands under the bleachers watching the high school football team behind his house go on a record setting winning streak that leads to the state championship game, and nostalgically tells of how Elvis would send the ice cream truck around for freebies to kids out playing in the field. Underscoring the backdrop is the story of the turbulent society and the generation then and now, and Thorne realistically depicts Elvis' glorified role as a crossover artist and prophet that swayed the hearts and attitudes of a billion people around the world . . . still . . . . He also tells a troubling tale how the area near the mansion went from being known as \\"The Beverly Hills of Memphis\\" to becoming the nation's most dangerous metropolitan area, where high school football games often end in shootouts. Intelligently written with flare and passion, this is a rare \\"must read\\" for Elvis fans and non-Elvis fans alike.	2003-09-07

The dialogue is smooth and flowing, but the character development was rocky and many of the central characters were never brought to resolution. Too much instrospection for the children and not enough emotionalism. However, the narrative passages were exquisite.

I've seen this plot elsewhere. I really thought sci fi and humanity would combine forces in this novel to tell a great tale of struggle against a new kind of bad guy and that maybe it contained a message to the future to beware of how far we push the technological envelope. But this promise never fulfilled itself. It's amazing how quickly this book rocketed to the top.

There was so much to dislike about this book I could write a book about it. Right off, the character names revealed the superficiality that was forthcoming. It seems that Mr. Barker wasn't sure of what kind of novel he wanted to write and so the storyline wandered and there was no continuity. His attempt to write erotica was poor and overdone as if someone were telling him to heat up his novels. He was torn between writing a Hollywood tale, a creepy tale and an erotic tale and it turned out to be a bad episode of DARK SHADOWS. I gave this book 2 stars out of respect for the body of work this author has written in the past. This book was a minus. For a thrilling tale about Hollywood, filled with hot erotica and an original storyline, check out OLDE HOLLYWOOD by Thorne Peters. Mr. Barker should write in the style that has brought him to greatness rather than trying to appease outside demands and if he does so I would buy his next book on the spot, because the man is a fantastic author and this one strike should not count him out.	2002-12-26

I would like for all readers to know about this book, because this book has the kind of depth that readers long for and cannot find amid the formulaic installment writers of this era. What is amazing is how this novel remains so vibrant 50 plus years after its release. The human interest aspect is still so poignant. The cast of characters are among the most interesting ever created and Mr. Michener does such a great job of bringing the time and place alive that you can smell it. I can't see how this was never made into a movie. From the poorhouse where he was raised by his aunt that ran the place to the funhouse where he meets a tragic prostitute that he falls in love with, David's story is a wonderful odyssey. The scene where the indigent members of the of the poorhouse pool their pennies to buy David clothing remains one of the classic moments in literature. I wish that today's writers would pick this book up before they pick up a pen and learn how to create this kind of chemistry in their books rather than just applying their formula. The only knock I have on this book, is that it lured me to read other Michener works that I found boring and longwinded. But I treasure this novel and so will you..	2002-12-25

This is the third novel by Thorne Peters I have reviewed before it was released and each are sensational in their own right, but this one is the closest to my heart. You're going to love these characters and you will marvel at the brilliant way that he tells their story. The range of this author is astounding. His ability to write dialogue and to compose narrative is rare. However his gift for writing poetry is what stunned me. Although there is a poem and a poetic reading in his other two novels, I had no idea the depth of verse he could conjure. When the world discovers him I believe that Thorne Peters will take his place among the great literati. As you cherish this novel, eat your hearts out, because the sequel--CLONED LEGACY-- has already been sent to me for a review and it is thrilling!!!!	2002-12-14

However, formulaic writing doesn't mean knocking off your own best efforts and that of other successful authors.

I'm a Lane Bryant girl married to a Big &amp; Tall man and I have had a loving, yes passionate, romance going for 11 years . . . and things aren't bad between my husband and I either . . . so what's the big deal about writing a Harlequin romance novel that doesn't have Fabio and Elle Mc Pherson on the cover?

Well there is no denying that the erotica is steamy fare in this compelling novel of highly charged sexuality. It comes the closest to rivaling Olde Hollywood by Thorne Peters in this regard . . . But it is not gratuitous; it is purposeful and intricate to creating the heart and mind of the character--- don't we all harbor similar thoughts of erotica; wishing that we could let go and revel in the hedonism that calls to us.

The imagery is startling and what it details is shocking, so, in order to continue, I had to regroup after I recoiled. I've gone back and read it in part and in whole several times since then for my own pleasure and I can say that you never stop discovering new layers each time. It is an amazing psycho thriller about the evil that men do and the women who thrill to it. It is the best kind of fiction in that it reads like a non fiction; there is history, romance, debauchery and tragedy throughout. My favorite aspect of the book is the character development and the choices he makes for their outcome. The heroine doesn't even speak until 2/3 of the way thru the book and the main character, Kingpin, actually is second billed to the subordinate character by the time the book ends. You will not be able to anticipate or believe what happens to them. It loses a star, because as a debut author Mr. Peters tried to do to much to compensate for being a novice and the book could use a better edit. But these minor glitches should not deter you from reading this grand Tinseltown tale.	2002-11-24

Despite the strong leads in the books, the supporting cast of characters play an equally powerful role. He displays an unbelievable talent for writing dialogue and an ability to diagram action that is unmatched by any author known to me. He masterfully tells their tale in two time periods in a way that keeps the book moving. Mr. Peters knows how to construct a paragraph in order to get the maximum potential out of it, so you read a little and get a lot from it; he brings the nuances of the moment to life fully. The melodrama of their dire circumstances is told with uproarious humor that will leave you feeling for them and rooting for them to make a comeback, while you're doubled over slapping your knee, as they quip their way thru the bad times and make it a good time for all who read about them.	2002-11-24
