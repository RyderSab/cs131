I feel like an 800-pound boulder going in to write anything less than an overwhelmingly positive review of \\"Between a Rock and a Hard Place\\".  How many people have said they'd give their right arm to have their memoirs reach the bestseller list?  Well, outdoorsman Aron Ralston actually did that.  Who, then, am I to judge his writing style? <br /> <br />There's no listed ghostwriter, and you can believe Ralston did structure and write the whole book himself.  A Carnegie Mellon grad with five years as a mechanical engineer, and well versed in outdoor literature, Ralston comes off as a talented writer (one would hope, however, that he'd avoid the inevitable trap of making his next book a thinly veiled roman-a-clef about a trapped rock climber).  However, the book is bogged down by two authorial -- if not editorial -- decisions: <br /> <br />First, the writing style is very technical, and therefore dense.  I'm not an outdoorsman; probably the most extreme things I've done in my adult life are to climb the Diamond Head on Oahu, which really just involved walking up a lot of stairs; and an extremely little bit of caving outside of Rapid City, South Dakota.  Although Ralston cites to Jon Krakauer as a writing inspiration, he lacks Krakauer's ability to make the extraordinary seem achievable.  I felt I could climb partway up Everest after reading \\"Into Thin Air\\".  After \\"Between a Rock and a Hard Place\\", I didn't even think I could ride a bicycle again. <br /> <br />Second, the alternating chapters.  I understand the structure of the book: in order to tell his whole life story, while keeping the suspense going, Ralston only describes his ordeal in odd-numbered chapters.  The balance of the book leads us first through his outdoors life, and then through the rescue effort that hastened his escape from Blue John Canyon and saved his life.  I found myself fidgeting during the earlier anecdotes.  While the black bear pursuit and the snow avalanche were gripping adventures, the rest of the tales really didn't add much to my enjoyment of the book -- and see again my complaint about the overly technical writing.  Ralston climbed over 40 mountains before the rock climbing accident; he describes every single climb, and I couldn't tell any of them apart when he was done. <br /> <br />I've already recommended this book to others.  I admire Ralston's attention to detail, his clinical look back at his own mental state during six days of captivity, and his sense of humor -- the line about his left arm on the book's final page is remarkable.  I don't know if I'd be able to go back and watch the videotape I'd made of myself, had I been the one pinned under that boulder -- and Ralston has clearly watched that footage multiple times.  This is clearly a man of extraordinary emotional strength.  However, his book could have been shorter and perhaps a little more user friendly -- and that's absolutely the worst you can say about it.	2005-10-11
US	51345392	R1JS8SBPMT4QA3	0525949070	961047257	The Commitment: Love, Sex, Marriage, and My Family	Books	5	74	76	N	N	Wake-Up Call	Dan Savage's new book examines the notion of gay marriage and whether or not it's a good thing -- not just for the USA, that is, but also for Dan Savage himself and his partner of 10 years, Terry. <br /> <br />Part introspective memoir, and part tirade against dinosaur-minded virtuecrats currently behind the wheel in Washington D.C., \\"The Commitment\\" is at all times an energetic wake-up call questioning just what it is that drove eleven (mostly) red states to pass \\"anti-gay marriage\\" Constitutional amendments last November.  Savage is strongly in favor of gay marriage in general, while not sure whether he himself wants to marry.  This give the book the dimensions it needs to succeed. <br /> <br />The best chapters are \\"Blue\\", in which Savage looks at the current political state of this country, while casting a hopeful eye at nearby Canada; and \\"Two Moments of Transcendent Bliss\\".  Followers of Savage will know that he and Terry jointly adopted a son who is now a skateboarding metalhead 6 year-old.  In this latter chapter, Savage has to explain to his son what it is to be gay, and what it is to be married.  If you can't make it through that chapter without being swayed by the pro-marriage argument, then none of the rest of this book is going to work for you. <br /> <br />I'll admit that while I'm something of a left-winger, my views have never swayed as far to the left as the death-to-Israel politics of NYC's alternative weekly \\"The Village Voice\\", where I first discovered the \\"Savage Love\\" column.  I also had no strong opinion on gay marriage until last year, when I took sides during the run-up to the Presidential election.  By the end of \\"The Commitment\\", I did have to question why I remained undecided on the issue for so long. <br /> <br />Savage's writing is 100% partisan and 100% persuasive, and he is most certainly not one of (to quote another recent partisan screed) one of the 100 people ruining America.	2005-10-01

The \\"switch\\" is that such jobs really don't exist anymore.  Fewer and fewer companies offer pensions.  They prefer to revolve temporary workers in and out rather than offer health care coverage to long-term full-time employees.  Loyal workers devote increasing amounts of energy and their own personal time, only to get laid off when the company's profit margin needs growing. <br /> <br />\\"Bait and Switch\\" is reported with a detached tone of shock and disgust, and a healthy dose of cynicism.  I'm not sure where Ehrenreich has been the last ten years -- films from the dramatic (\\"American Beauty\\") to the hilarious (\\"Office Space\\") have already covered this ground and made these discoveries. <br /> <br />Most interesting and revelatory, then, is how Ehrenreich's undercover mission itself gets baited and switched.  Ehrenreich gives the impression that she thought a white-collar job would be a paid vacation.  Instead, most of her job search time is consumed and subverted by a very specific shadow industry of \\"career coaching\\". <br /> <br />I am fortunate to be in the legal profession, which is not the target of \\"Bait and Switch\\".  I work for a mid-sized firm which is refreshingly free of the insane management culture portrayed by Barbara Ehrenreich.  I have never been asked to take a personality test and in over 3 years I have never heard someone use terms such as \\"self-actualization\\" or \\"interpersonal growth\\". <br /> <br />However, I spent my own periods of pre-bar exam underemployment dodging that shadow industry.  I once ran screaming from a \\"sales\\" job at a really tiny dot.com startup.  Later, an agency promising \\"direct connections\\" to \\"federal jobs\\" saturated New York City newspapers with advertisements.  The interviews, conducted after a $20 access fee, led toa request for $1000 for a course of seminars.  It turns out they were not selling jobs; they were selling buzzwords and imagery.  Last I heard, the head of that outfit wound up in prison.  Ehrenreich too spends several thousand dollars on such services, in exchange for play-dates with \\"Wizard of Oz\\" dolls and the sub-rubber-chicken circuit at the Hampton Inn. <br /> <br />Ehrenreich's tone is one of extreme detachment and sarcasm.  The several career coaches who took Ehrenreich's time and patience, and never delivered her even an inch closer to the type of white collar executive job she sought, are verbally lacerated.  One chapter in depth targets Christian job search networks.  While there is a lot of worthwhile material, my concern is that, as with \\"Nickel and Dimed\\", Ehrenreich's at times gonzo tone is going to alienate a lot of the people who would benefit most from reading her.  Her contempt for the Christian network, while certainly merited based on the facts revealed in this book (such as the warm-up jokes delivered by various network guest speakers), is not going to sit well with a good portion of the target audience. <br /> <br />\\"Bait and Switch\\" provides an absorbing mix of job-search anecdotes, and revealing statistics.  The proposed solution, however, is going to vanish without a trace under the current administration.  Maybe just highlighting the trends themselves, and asking the uderemployed to gather en masse by the ballot box, is the best solution.  I just hope that readers don't mistake her tone for one of \\"limousine liberal\\" contempt and put the book down long before they get to the end.	2005-09-25

Unlike Tom Seaver's post-World Series effort, Clendenon's book had a lot to say, and said it with lots of candor.  The level of detail was remarkable, as was the breadth of topics. <br /> <br />The beginning of the book demonstrated just how difficult it was to be an African-American baseball player in the early 1960s, when teams had self-imposed quotas.  I'm still not sure this is a widely-known fact.  Breaking in with the Pirates, Clendenon revealed, was difficult when their complement of black players was limited to \\"Roberto Clemente and his Spanish-speaking roommate\\". <br /> <br />Clendenon also did not end the story with a freeze-frame after Game 5 of the World Series.  His post-baseball law degree, personal troubles, and illnesses received equal attention and candor. <br /> <br />I had the opportunity to see Donn at a book signing on Long Island shortly after \\"Miracle\\" came out.  He spoke with dignity and inner strength. <br /> <br />He will most certainly be missed.	2005-09-18

This is not the book that will describe all the legislation, retell the historic meetings, and disclose all the backroom deals that characterized Bob Dole's several decades on Capitol Hill; it is not a history of what Dole saw at the Reagan revolution or the Newt Gingrich Year(s).  It's just a story of his adolescence, his military service, and how World War II left him a diminished and then a greater man. <br /> <br />I'm not a Dole partisan -- I voted against him the one time I had the opportunity -- but like many people in my demographic, I gained an appreciation for him after he exited political life.  I even forgave him the Britney Spears Pepsi commercial.  After his recent appearance on \\"The Daily Show\\" plugging the book, I figured I'd have to read it and learn a little more. <br /> <br />Although it's non partisan, you can see Dole's roots showing through clearly: \\"One Soldier's Story\\" is very much a celebration of the small-town life.  Dole's parents are noble and broadly drawn; likewise his fellow citizens in Russell, Kansas.  Everyone stands up for everyone else, and when Dole needs surgery to restore some use to his shattered right arm, the whole community comes together through donations to a cigar box at the local drug store. <br /> <br />Most of the chapters relate to how Dole recovered after being shot on a hill in the Italian Alps less than a month before V-E Day.  I knew of his injury; what I did not know is that he suffered from quadriplegia for over two years after that.  I did not know of Percy Jones Hospital, and how three future influential U.S. Senators graduated from its wards.  I did not know how much Bob Dole had to overcome to get within a few voter percentage points of the Presidency. <br /> <br />I read the book quickly and was absorbed by the simple, direct storytelling Dole's co-writer utilized.  The book has a simple, direct purpose, so the infinite details of Bill Clinton's refrigerator-sized memoir weren't needed.  I only chafed at the very end when Dole dropped the phrase \\"compassionate conservatism\\" and tried to shoehorn his political philosphy into a few paragraphs... but that's just two pages out of almost 300, and doesn't detract from the larger tale of adversity, heroism, and the call to public service.	2005-09-15
US	51345392	R17BDAGIQN7GZ	0345478983	696961016	The Godfather Returns	Books	3	2	4	N	N	A man who doesn't spend time with his Family...	There are two ways you can grade this book.  You can ask how faithful it is to the existing \\"universe\\" shared by Mario Puzo's original novel and the three movies.  Or you can ask, were there never a \\"Godfather\\" and were Mark Winegardner writing for original characters, how well this book deserves to be remembered. <br /> <br />The second way of grading \\"The Godfather Returns\\" isn't really a fair one.  Winegardner, although he does get to create an original villain, and expand on several characters (one of whom, Francesca Corleone, existed only as a deleted scene from the second movie), was not paid by the Puzo estate to create a lasting work of art.  He was paid, if you read the copyright page and see that his name does not appear, to continue a franchise, perhaps a la the Star Wars books, in which individual authors get paid by flat fee and not by royalties. <br /> <br />Anyway, you can test this book either by its originality, or by its adherence to the original. Moments where Winegardner tries to explain away scenes from the movies fall woefully flat.  Is there a stronger moment in cinema than when Kay tells Michael, after the Senate hearing, that she's leaving him?  And why?  Well, Winegardner rumbles on in and completely undercuts that moment, changing Kay's motivation.  I'm not sure what's scarier, that Winegardner felt he had to rewrite the scene that way, or that the copyright holder wanted him to do that.  People love \\"The Godfather\\"; if you're going to go in and revise history, there's not much reason to follow the franchise into the future. <br /> <br />Other sequences work better.  Tom Hagen's story is filled in, and the wildly out-of-character action he takes at the book's climax is made to work in context.  Fredo, who for reasons best explained by the second movie, only appears in the first half of this book, is retroactively given a very year-2000 character motivation... but, again, it works because of Winegardner's straightforward, no winking-at-the-audience, writing style. <br /> <br />The book's fatal undoing -- or its major strength, depending on your point of view -- is that it's really not a book about the Corleones at all, for all its filling in of the Corleone family tree.  It's really the story of Nick Geraci, former Corleone soldier, and now an embittered man looking to conquer the family from the inside.  It's the story of how he spends over a decade, behind all the scenes you saw in the first two movies, and at the forefront of a whole bunch of new scenes, trying to become the next Don Corleone.  We hear about where the Corleones failed, and how Geraci thinks he could have run things better. <br /> <br />I couldn't stand him.  But then again, maybe Geraci serves as the point of reference for the author: someone 30 years late to the party, asked to retell one of America's great stories on his own terms.	2005-09-06

Joe Willie Namath was one of those larger than life sports stars, whose fame outshone his on-field achievements, whose name lived on in inverse proportion to his off-field accomplishments.  Namath came of athletic age in a particular moment in time, in the middle of a generational split where even a mere athlete could become a politically divisive figure. <br /> <br />Namath did not submit to an interview for this book, and that is for the better.  Kriegel did a remarkable job on his research, or perhaps his documentation is remarkable; I have not read many recent sports biographies with such extensive source notes.  Kriegel even dates his interviews, so you can see how long he spent on the project.  He interviews friends and enemies alike.  While this book is certainly \\"warts and all\\", it is also hero worship.  Kriegel watched all the game films and spoke to all the survivors.  While Namath's less proud moments are on the page, this is not a sinister tell-all or a cynical debunking. <br /> <br />The reconstruction of Namath's childhood in Beaver Falls, PA, would appear to be definitive.  I can't speak to factual errors in the game summaries, but Kriegel has clearly watched the game broadcasts and NFL Films footage, so I would be surprised if there are any of the blatant errors that you would find in other football or baseball books.  Namath's rise and his eventual Super Bowl III triumph takes up two-thirds of the text; the positive does outweight the negative. <br /> <br />The sad end to Namath's career, including his one irrelevant season with the Rams, is described game by game.  Perhaps this material could have been condensed.  But, as the downside of Namath's career was perhaps a year longer than his rise, the book would be a cheat if it only spent a chapter or two on his post-1968 football play. <br /> <br />More depressing, then, is the look at Namath's post-football media presence.  The divisive figure with the long hair and the mink coat and the Fu Manchu became a dinner theater actor with a long string of second-tier endorsements for an electronics chain in the New York City suburbs.  This is of course a gross oversimplification of things; Namath's investments, as described here, have been shrewd, and I can't think of other unauthorized celebrity bios that spend so much time on how much the hero loves his children.  The book's true heartbreak comes when his girls follow their mother across the country in the wake of his divorce. <br /> <br />Today's larger-than-life athletes seem to lack Namath's swagger: witness Barry Bonds' bizarre press conferences in the wake of BALCO, which eclipsed Namath's \\"I'm not selling, I quit\\" moment.  Even Curt Schilling, whose journey with the 2004 Boston Red Sox echoes what Namath did for the AFL and the Jets, sold short the bloody sock in a mere ten days by doing telephone endorsements for George W. Bush.  Namath would never have done that; in fact, to his credit, he made Richard Nixon's enemies list.  On the other hand, Namath's retirement was absent the public humiliation that has recently attached to Mark McGwire and Rafael Palmeiro, or the belated admiration finally won by Ali.  His worst moment came on the sidelines of an ESPN broadcast, embarrassing but hardly ruinous. <br /> <br />Maybe the fact that he wound up with such an \\"ordinary\\" life makes \\"Namath\\"'s final 150 pages a bit hollow.  He paid his bills, he loved his kids, he rejected the chance to host \\"Family Feud\\".  However, \\"Namath\\" is still a well-researched monument to a great man from a pivotal moment in history.  Without embarrassment, you could say the \\"N\\" in \\"NFL\\" now stands for \\"Namath\\".	2005-08-29

Doc narrates his gambling-man take on parts of four different football seasons, and it all starts to run together long before the paperback concludes on page 243.  Honestly, by the end, I couldn't keep track of who had won which Super Bowl, and whether or not HST beat the point spread.  Are the Raiders still in the league? <br /> <br />Reading a collection of ESPN.com colums covering November 2000 through October 2003 in something far quicker than real time is perhaps not the way Hunter S. Thompson is meant to be read.  The columns that stuck in my memory, oddly enough, were not the Gonzo columns (except for the stories about Prince \\"Omar\\" running through the 2001 World Series).  The single column take on Dale Earnhardt's death at the Daytona was the first reprint in the book to grab me by the lapels of my T-shirt.  The discussion of the Honolulu Marathon raises a point so amazing I can't believe I hadn't read it elsewhere before -- in what other sport do professionals and amateurs compete on the same course and the same time? <br /> <br />I wish the editing of \\"Hey Rube\\" had been a bit tighter.  The back cover blurb promises \\"critics' favorites, and never-before-published columns\\"... without identifying inside the book which is which.  The first \\"Hey Rube\\", from November 2000, is printed out of sequence and highlighted on a gray background.... and that's the only column in the collection to be given special treatment. <br /> <br />Finally, the paperback ends in mid-October 2003, not compiling the balance of HST's columns through February 2005.  We thus miss his take on the 2004 Presidential election.  Did Kerry win?  Did Doc cover the 3-point popular vote spread?  ESPN.com still has these final columns archived.  Read more than a year after the release of the hardcover, the paperback edition of \\"Hey Rube\\" is a book without an ending.	2005-08-15

Woodward evidently began writing the book some years ago, and dusted it off instantly after Deep Throat's family decided to go public.  \\"The Secret Man\\" thus came out in a hurry, and, in order to justify its retail price, is padded out with eye-friendly large print and wide margins.<br /><br />It's also one of the more important books of the year.  This is not a quickie biography of W. Mark Felt, as indeed Woodward admits he only ever knew the man in a professional sense.  Rather, Woodward tells us how he met Felt, and how Felt came to play a role in his and Bernstein's reportage of the tip of the Watergate iceberg in June 1972.  Woodward pulls no punches, showing us his own mixed feelings over the turns of the relationship.<br /><br />The story takes an even more fantastic turn some years after Watergate, when Felt is convicted of a federal offense, having authorized surveillance of ordinary citizens in an attempt to bust the Weather Underground -- an act so outside the law that Richard Nixon actually testified in defense at Felt's trial.  To bring the story full circle, Felt is pardoned by Ronald Reagan and becomes a Republican.<br /><br />This book works as an emotional biography of Woodward's career, but even more so as an attempt to piece together why this career G-man, Mark Felt, would risk his own career to reveal what he believed to be criminal behavior coming from the White House.  Felt's name did not appear in \\"All the President's Men\\", or even the published version of the Haldeman diaries; his identity was known, prior to this year, only to the most die-hard students of Watergate.<br /><br />What were Felt's motives?  Woodward spends the last half of the book in search of the answer.  He interviews Felt twice, but Felt is already deep into his 80s and no longer coherent.  Woodward cannot even reveal the name to the press after Felt outs himself to his family, fearing that Felt's competence is in question.  Woodward's best answer to the motive question comes in his final chapter.  Did Felt, a loyal Hoover man, become Deep Throat solely for revenge, after Nixon passed him over (twice!) for the FBI Director role he believed he'd earned?  Woodward considers, and discards, this answer, coming up with a fascinating alternate take.<br /><br />I do admit that I felt a little let down by Woodward's solution -- but the conclusion is the best logical answer left.  The answer cuts across political partisan lines.  Those who believe the current climate of the executive branch to be even more toxic than in Nixon's day, may find salvation in the career of a civil servant who cherished the principles of freedom so much that a government collapsed when he spoke out.<br /><br />Woodward does not conclude the book on his own -- he ends the book in 2004, before Felt's family published their story.  Instead, he fittingly turns over the final chapter to Carl Bernstein, who describes what he, Bernstein and Ben Bradlee opted to do the day the Vanity Fair story broke.  Bernstein's final message rings a clarion call in the post Dan Rather-gate mediasphere: \\"[R]eporters need editors.  In the end we are collaborators and they make the final calls.

What I remembered is that stories about Jim Morrison's life after 1968 devolve into an endless parade of ruined concerts and alcoholic fogs.  As a reader, one needs a metaphorical iron stomach to make it all the way from Venice Beach in 1965 to that bathtub in Paris to July 3, 1971. <br /> <br />A lot of the anecdotes Davis related were familiar to me from the tabloid quality \\"No-one Here Gets Out Alive\\", or from the Tolstoy-length \\"Break On Through\\".  The editing is suspect, as in \\"Break On Through\\": The Doors make their final appearance at the Winterland in San Francisco three times (twice in eight pages!). <br /> <br />Davis's book takes a slightly different approach to the earlier books but essentially tells the same stories.  For example, he provides less detail about the day-to-day proceedings of the Dade County obscenity trial, in favor of questioning whether or not the presiding judge was on Richard Nixon's payroll.  And where \\"No-one\\" spent a lot of time postulating that Morrison was still alive, and \\"Break On Through\\" revealed that (gasp!) Morrison may have died of a heroin overdose (gasp!), \\"Jim Morrison\\" is the book that actually walks the reader through his final days in Paris and constructs a credible timeline.  Davis builds up the false hope of Morrison's escape from the public eye, and then shows how ill-used he was even in death. <br /> <br />I found it interesting that the book carefully details as fact, scenes from the Oliver Stone movie which Stone himself admitted he'd made up in order to illustrate a general point, such as the exchange with Andy Warhol about the gold-plated telephone.  On the other hand, I quite liked Davis's efficient debunking of the Lizard Queen.  While the book's lack of attributions (and an index!) is annoying, I don't doubt that Davisdid a comprehensive job on the research, and I don't doubt that he chose his sides very carefully.  In general, the research is well documented.  The passages from Morrison's journals, especially the ones written in Paris, are revealing, as is the June 1971 photo of Morrison showing him to weigh nearly 300 pounds. <br /> <br />Lengthy asides into social history may have been superfluous, perhaps, in that all those '60s stories have been told before.  But those same oft-told tales are essential for putting not only Jim Morrison in context, but the rest of his bandmates as well.  The father of the man who wrote \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" was a player at the Gulf of Tonkin; the epochal sound produced by Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore came directly from their immersion in the TM and Eastern religion then in vogue. <br /> <br />In the end, the length of Davis's book is justified, even though it takes as long to read about the troubled making of the \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" and \\"Soft Parade\\" albums as it must have taken to produce them.	2005-07-31

I have to admit up front that I simply was not around when most of the stories in this book took place, especially those relating to Wallach's life on the stage in the 1940s through 1960s.  In fact, I'd never even heard of most of those plays, except perhaps in passing; I know him best from \\"The Godfather Part III\\", and (randomly) from the audiobook of Stephen King's \\"Insomnia\\".  As the book's anecdotes essentially end in 1967, Wallach does not cover this ground.  I put the book on my wish list simply because I wanted to know more about the guy, and to learn more about an era I missed out on. <br /> <br />The book's tone is set by the prologue, in which Wallach sets out to research the role of gangster Albert Anastasia for a guest appearance in a TV series, and learns that he has a much closer connection with the crime boss's family than he suspected.  Several chapters then detail Wallach's Jewish upbringing in sepia-toned Brooklyn (just six miles from where two of my grandparents were doing the same thing in East New York). <br /> <br />I found myself equally captivated by Wallach's stories of growing up, and his tales of working on an impressive body of theatrical and film work.  Entire chapters are given over to \\"The Misfits\\" and \\"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\\".  Wallach spends lots of time discussing his (often better-known) co-stars, ranging from Clark Gable to Marlon Brando to Sir John Gielgud to a very young Alan Arkin.  No-one is insulted; particularly warm, extended looks at Marilyn Monroe and Clint Eastwood are featured.  The tone is very pleasant and inviting. <br /> <br />Written in a very simple, direct writing style, with no credited co-author, this autobiography will not require much of your time, but will leave you with lots of anecdotes to re-tell.  Based on the time frame presented, a sequel is theoretically in the offing.  I will update my wish list accordingly.	2005-07-17

Twice this past week I found myself sitting next to someone on the train reading the same telltale blue and yellow paperback.  \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" is a sleight-of-hand novel not easily captured by a back-cover blurb; it's a novel that's going to defy just about any expectation thrown at it.  I would have liked to spend more time discussing the book with my seatmates, but you just don't do that kind of thing on the subway. <br /> <br />The thing I find most fascinating about the book is the emotional evolution of its erstwhile narrator Alex.  He's the Ukrainian teen who reluctantly plays translator to an American college student (named after author Foer) trying to find the shtetl from which his maternal grandfather escaped the Holocaust.  The opening letters and chapters penned by a rather shallow Alex are full of clever wordplay, although they read a bit strained.  It's not easy to write deliberately fractured English and get away with it, and some of the textbook words assigned to Alex (\\"manufacturing\\", or \\"guilelessly\\" substituted for \\"sincerely\\") get annoying after a while. <br /> <br />Where this gets fascinating, then, is in the timeframe.  The central events of the book -- what happens when Alex and his visually deficient grandfather lead Jonathan to the shtetl -- presumably take place in June or July.  But the events are not retold by Alex until several months later, in the form of slightly fictionalized chapters that Alex writes and sends to Jonathan back in the US.  So, as the novel develops, we see that the more distant in time Alex gets from the actual events, the more he learns and the more he grows.  This makes sense from the standpoint that this novel celebrates the power of the written word -- from Alex's letters to Jonathan, through the recorded actions of the comedic 18th century shtetl dwellers, to the inscription on the back of the photograph that leads Jonathan toUkraine in the first place. <br /> <br />The book's most powerful revelations -- one about Alex, one about his grandfather -- are saved for the final pages.  Therefore, you have to get through a lot of Foer's wordplay in order to discover the book's true reward.  For example, the fictionalized Jonathan writes several chapters from the point of view of his imagined shtetl forebears.  Having read my grandmother's own writings about her own shtetl circa 1910-1915, I appreciate just how far Foer elevated the daily routine into the realm of the fantastic.  Again, some of that material seems slightly strained. <br /> <br />All I will say in closing is that, tiring as I found Foer's literary devices in certain places, they still create an incredible payoff.  It took me about two weeks to get from front cover to back cover, so I lost a lot of small details along the way that I would have retained had I read it all in two or three days.  I therefore went back and reread several chapters from the book after I was done, to help put things in perspective.  This is not the kind of book, in the long run, that you can just walk away from.  Assuming I ever find someone who can help me put all the pieces together, I will certainly be reading this one again.	2005-07-11
US	51345392	R2X9NJ9KTQNPC8	1400048923	116006151	Barman: Ping-Pong, Pathos, and Passing the Bar	Books	4	2	2	N	N	View from the other side	It's nearly a decade since I started law school, and over five years since I sat for the New York bar exam.  The novelty of \\"Barman\\" lies in the fact that its author, unlike the writers of \\"The Paper Chase\\" and \\"One-L\\", didn't go to a top tier law school.  Alex Wellen went to Temple, ranked by U.S. News & World Report as a second tier school.  I can do the author one better -- my midwestern law school didn't reach Tier 2 until after I graduated, and dropped out again this year.  I also didn't finish in the top 10% of my class, as did Wellen, and had to wait a lot longer to land with a NYC law firm.  So my philosophy from the first chapter was that while Wellen may have had it rough, he still had a comparatively easy time compared to many of us among the great unwashed. <br /> <br />As I was familiar with Wellen's journey, I paid more attention to the mechanics of his writing, bearing in mind his opening caution that his book was inspired by true events.  Most readers may not know, for example, that Wellen described taking a portion of the New York bar exam (the multistate performance test) that wasn't introduced until several years later.  Also, the thinly-veiled description of his law firm becomes even thinner if you study the patent on the final page of the book (this may have been intentional, of course).  Finally, after describing every moment of his nine month journey from law school graduation through swearing-in to the bar, Wellen informs us in a very brief quota that he quit the profession less than a year later. <br /> <br />I mention these points only to praise with faint damns.  I can't think of too many other things wrong with \\"Barman\\".  Wellen captures the emotional spiral of studying for the bar quite effectively.  So too does he capture the dread of waiting for results, and of looking for signs and portents in such miniscule details as the size of the envelope in which his results were delivered.  The state of Michigan pulled a similar nasty trick onme in November 1998. <br /> <br />One final caveat: Large portions of this book escape the law altogether.  Whereas One-L hardly ever ventured beyond the Harvard campus, Barman stretches from the wild West of Oregon to hostel laundry rooms in Western Europe.  We get a lot of stories from Wellen's social life (most of his girlfriends did not wait for the third date to express their affection) as well as his slapstick attempts to convert his TriBeCa loft into a swingin' bachelor pad.  These episodes add texture to Wellen's law school routine and help prevent the book from becoming monotonous. <br /> <br />Girlfriends of potential law students may cast off their worries, however: not all of us who survived law school had as much fun as Wellen.	2005-07-06

This book only covers state and national parks, and known hiking trails on the five islands you can get to (thus excluding Lana'i, and the inaccessible Kaho'olawe and Niihau.  Therefore, it's best used in conjunction with the other general books on the subject. <br /> <br />I found this book to be of value for the three islands I visited.  There's a little bit of outdated information about climbing the Diamond Head volcano crater on Oahu.  More useful to me were the extend portions about Waimea Canyon State Park on Kauai (absolutely gorgeous even if you're only driving up, as my wife and I did) and the material about Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island.  This latter section was especially helpful in terms of providing background information, as we had a poor commercial tour guide who frequently missed the points we were interested in. <br /> <br />I recommend this book even for the non-hiker (we limited ourselves mostly to the \\"easy\\" trails) because the level of detail about the two state parks mentioned above, surpasses both what I found in other books and even from some tour guides.	2005-07-04

This is one of two travel books my wife and I brought along.  By the end of the trip I found it best as a background guide.  A 40-page section on culture and history (\\"Hawaii Is\\" and \\"Hawaii Was\\") is the highlight of the book.  I read through that more than once as it provided info I didn't get from local tour guides, bus drivers or fellow explorers.<br /><br />Attractions on the six major islands are rated on a system of one through three arrows.  The USS Arizona Memorial on Oahu mysteriously received only two, perhaps because of the impossibly long lines that defeat entry unless you arrive before 11 AM.  The restaurant listings are similarly thin, although California Pizza Kitchen, a chain you can find outside of Hawaii, somehow merited a listing under Honolulu.<br /><br />Obviously there's a lot to see in Hawaii and you're not going to plan your trip based on just one 200-page book.  I found the Fodor's book to be adequate in terms of helping me get around or figuring out what I wanted to see on the three islands I visited.  The book is never going to replace talking to people and getting recommendations, but obviously that's not whath it's there for.<br /><br />The best you can say is that people go to Hawaii for vastly different reasons and the Fodor's book tries to accomodate as many of those groups as possible.	2005-07-03
US	51345392	R502JO6F0BUMJ	0879462809	581884632	Strat-O-Matic Fanatics: The Unlikely Success Story Of A Game That Became An American Passion	Books	4	33	35	N	N	Great game + sloppy writing = great book	Obviously, you're not going to read this book unless you've already invested hundreds of hours of your life in playing Strat-O-Matic Baseball.  I got the game as a birthday present from a cousin when I turned ten, and again from my mother when I turned 14.  With the occasional lapse along the way, I've been a regular player for over 20 years now, and was even fortunate enough to get my name in the computer game credits for two of those years.  Therefore, I was destined to buy and read this book, even if it was written by, oh, let's say, the editorial staff of the Washington Times. <br /> <br />Glenn Guzzo, newspaper editor and long-time Strat-O fan, is the man who refused to use the corporate name for the new Mile High Stadium in Denver in his old paper.  I therefore had high hopes for the writing of this book.  Basically, I was disappointed with the end result, but not enough to prevent me from finishing.  Maybe the problem is in the editing -- game creator Harold \\"Hal\\" Richman is called by his full name on almost every other page.  Other details, such as the circumstances of Hal's first \\"intimate encounter\\" with a woman, just don't belong here. <br /> <br />However, the star of this book is the Strat-O-Matic game, the  history of which would be enthralling no matter what.  The stories from celebrity Strat-O players are quite welcome, especially Spike Lee's.  I'm actually going to have to watch \\"Crooklyn\\" now.  So Guzzo's done what a team of wild horses haven't been able to do. <br /> <br />The first two thirds of the book detail the game's creation, and its survival by creative evolution in the competitive board-game and video game markets.  One upside is that, since I finished the book, I've been playing my computer version in dice mode, the first time I've rolled dice to play Strat-O in almost a decade.  Not that the results have worked out very well for my retro-league 1934 Boston Braves.  Wally Berger, stay out of the 3 column! <br /> <br />The final third ofthe book details the derivation of the annual fielding ratings, and also includes numerous personal stories, such as a weekend at a face-to-face Strat tournament, and biographies of representative Strat players.  As with any game that requires such a time commitment in order to become proficient, Strat draws its share of troubled personalities for whom the game defeats real life.  I had to set the game aside in college when it came time to graduate, and didn't get back to it for two years, until my academic future stabilized.  The book covers the down side as well as the up. <br /> <br />A book about Strat-O-Matic is going to have a built-in audience and is not going to have much crossover appeal.  Therefore, it need not be written by David McCullough or Simon Winchester (though that would be nice).  I doubt that a significant portion of the target audience is going to be put off by simplistic writing or the occasional awkward literary device (\\"That is why the boys' discovery...nearly killed Strat-O-Matic before its birth\\").  Go read the book, then pick up the dice and cards for a few hours, and see if you can't manage to lose a few to my lowly '34 Braves.	2005-07-03
US	51345392	R1RFWZSZIVS0IN	0452260302	940938089	The Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop.	Books	4	36	36	N	N	The Boxscores Were Enough	I don't recommend this book for the faint of heart. While you can summarize the basic story of \\"The Universal Baseball Association\\" in a few words, the actual reading experience is far more intense than a summary would suggest. This book celebrates the myth of baseball as American creation in just about the darkest way imaginable. <br /> <br />The novel's set-up is an appealing one. J. Henry Waugh (whose initials read YAHWEH) took eight of the original post-Civil War major league franchises, populated them entirely with players of his own invention, and evolved his league through dozens of seasons via a tabletop, dice-activated baseball game of his own design. The league begins to consume his life in its 56th season -- and his 56th year. It sounds fun to take on a project like this. Indeed, on the Internet you can even find recreations of the UBA charts as J. Henry Waugh may have designed them. <br /> <br />As the book goes on, however, progressively fewer paragraphs are devoted to the point of view of our protagonist. Rather, Henry's players -- unaware of his very existence -- begin to do all the talking for him. The slide begins innocently enough: Henry leaves work a few minutes early one Wednesday afternoon so he can reread the boxscore of a perfect game one of \\"his\\" rookies pitched the night before. While reading, he imagines the past greats of his league telling stories about the early years. In one of the book's funnier moments, one of those old-time players is suddenly cut off in mid-quote when Henry realizes that the man in question is, in fact, dead. <br /> <br />Thus we learn more about Henry's league: His players live full lives after retirement from the playing field, and can even marry, have children, and die. The league structure involves politics, intrigue, romance, music -- sometimes all at once. One of the book's more gruesome in-jokes is retold in a ballad that Henry wrote to celebrate the exploits of one \\"Long Lew Lydell\\". <br /> <br />As the bookprogresses, Coover writes verbose yet carefully structured passages in which Henry vanishes entirely, replaced by the players taking increasing free reign over his subconscious. What the players say in Henry's head is a subtle distortion of what Henry's just been through. Henry's take on women is colored, for example, by the fact that his girlfriend charges by the hour; his players have dreams which mirror his own anxieties. It gets so that Henry can't even complete a conversation with the few acquaintainces in his life, without the players' voices intruding. This becomes progressively more disturbing, especially if you note what happens during Henry's final appearance in the book. <br /> <br />You can't blame Henry for leaving behind such a dreary accounting job; he is escaping into a richer world than did Bartleby, for example. In fact, you could put the book down after Chapter 7 and read it as a happy ending. In 2005, I'd almost venture to say that \\"Office Space\\"-type fantasies retroactively make Henry one of the first heroes of the so-called information age. One of the key questions at the end: are we meant to feel sympathy for Henry at the end? Empathy? Pity? Disgust? <br /> <br />What gives \\"Universal Baseball Association\\" its life is not the baseball scenes or the office scenes, but rather the depth and texture of Henry's increasingly complicated fantasy sequences. You can see the entropy in Henry's universe by comparing the player names in the final chapter to those in the first two chapters, before things started to go wrong. While difficult to get through -- this is certainly not a beach book, although that's where I read most of it -- \\"Universal Baseball Association\\" rewards repeated readings once you overcome the queasy feelings caused by entering Henry's subconscious. <br /> <br />You will also vow never to play Strat-O-Matic Baseball again.	2005-07-02

I like the paperback-edition cover of \\"Candyfreak\\".  It took me about 20 seconds total to identify all the various candy-bar wrappers which make up the individual letters to the word \\"candyfreak\\" (which is not actually a word).  It's photo-editorial cheating that the \\"n\\" and the \\"f\\" from the same bar.  And I'm not quite sure about the last \\"a\\", I haven't seen that one in a while, but I gave myself the point for what I think it is.  And, dude, the first \\"a\\" doesn't even come from a chocolate bar, so properly it doesn't even belong on the book.  Was the \\"a\\" from \\"Milky Way\\" not available?<br /><br />Most of the book involves author Almond touring privately-owned candy companies west of the Mississippi River, and describing, layer by layer, what each bar tastes like.  I'm not sure if Almond is a good writer or not, but this book gave me a sugar rush on every third page.  Not too many other authors have made me sweat before, so that's plus ten for Almond.  By the end of \\"Candyfreak\\" I was ready to call Wilford Brimley and ask him to get all those diabetes medications delivered to my door.  I'm not sure that humorous non-fiction is supposed to leave the reader sweaty and dry-mouthed, but if I never eat another candy bar again, it will be too soon.  Thanks, Almond, if that is your real name.<br /><br />I enjoyed just about all of \\"Candyfreak\\", even the weird intrusions that could have been edited out: the political discussion, the \\"depressing but necessary digression\\" about the author's health, and basically the whole first chapter.  It's fine to write an expose on what's happening to America's last remaining independently-owned candy makers, and it's fine to write a confessional book about your love affair with processed caramel, but if you're going to write both books at the same time, make sure your own voice doesn't drown out the subject you're exposing.  Stefan Fatsis in \\"Word Freak\\" wrote himself on to every page, but never made a Michael Moore or Jim Carrey out of himself.  In \\"Candyfreak\\", I got the sense that Almond manufactured his assembly-line pratfalls in order to steal scenes that didn't need stealing.<br /><br />So, while Almond may lack subtlety, and while he almost got me to swear off chocolate bars forever, I will say that I can't imagine many other writers had this much fun spending their advance.of himself.

US	51345392	RCWXSQJXRLIIW	0060507330	281213133	The Bad Guys Won!	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Between the White Lines	Jeff Pearlman wasn't much older than me in 1986... deep into his junior high school years and watching the baseball playoffs on TV.  While many books have been written about the 1986 Mets, most of those were from participants and first-hand observers.  Jerry Izenberg and Dan Shaughnessy wrote quickly-forgotten journalistic accounts the following year, as did ghost-writers for Gary Carter and Lenny Dykstra.  Of course, to say that Dykstra's book was quickly forgotten would be unjust... his book is well-remembered, but not for any of the right reasons. <br /> <br />Pearlman's achievement is to insert himself into the story nearly 20 years later and write an extended \\"Sports Illustrated\\"-style look at the seamy underbelly of \\"baseball like it oughtta be\\".  He does this through 187 interviews, but no bibliography.  Therefore, if you're keeping track of that kind of thing, it's not easy to determine which player quotes derive from fresh interviews, and which are recycled from old sources.  However, his recreations of the infamous Cooter's nightclub arrests, and the trashing of the charter plane flying home from Houston after Game 6 of the NLCS, benefit from an I-was-there sardonic third-person reporting style. <br /> <br />John Rocker now plays baseball on Long Island, for an independent team -- for Bud Harrelson, in point of fact.  The intersection is amusing for readers of \\"The Bad Guys Won!\\", as Harrelson features in the book, and as Pearlman is the guy who in some respects helped Rocker travel the terrifying downward spiral from World Series to Central Islip.  As you might expect from the author who allowed Rocker to marinate in his own oratory, \\"The Bad Guys Won!\\" also features more finger-pointing than other books.  Shaughnessy's \\"One Strike Away\\" tells us that Wally Backman went bowling when Game 7 of the World Series was rained out; Pearlman is more interested in following Doc Gooden and Darryl Strawberry, and in reopening the Kevin Mitchell vs. the kitten tale,and in pointing out that some oblivious Met did some lines of coke on the way back from Houston. <br /> <br />Pearlman is at his best talking about the role players, whom he clearly admires: the two unnecessary Eds, Hearn and Lynch, do well here.  On the other hand, George Foster, who was bounced out of baseball before the playoffs began, doesn't merit the author's sympathy; I would have expected Pearlman to defend him, simply because no-one else ever did.  The playoff game accounts are authentic.  Pearlman has clearly spent a lot of time with the game tapes and ESPN Classic rebroadcasts, as he takes time to describe the flight path of the toilet paper roll spiraling behind Mookie Wilson just before Bob Stanley wild pitched the tying run home. <br /> <br />\\"Bad Guys\\" is a short, meaty read, providing a new look at often-told tales about a bunch of players who won it all and then promptly raced into early obscurity.  A few days after I finished the book, new allegations about Lenny Dykstra popped up in the media.  Clearly Pearlman may have been on to something.	2005-05-30

In a baseball literature field typically dominated by vapid autobiographies (speaking of which, I just finished Don Zimmer's second book), few third-person bios merit repeat readings.  In the last 30 years, books about Babe Ruth, Mo Berg and Sandy Koufax probably own the top of the field.  Of course, each of those books used wildly differing approaches.  Robert Creamer took an almost mythical approach to The Babe (\\"The Legend Comes To Life\\"), and hurries through his final, post-baseball years in literally a dozen pages.  Nicholas Dawidoff's take on Moe Berg, on the other hand, uses baseball almost as prelude to the heart of the book, Berg's bizarre late-life wanderings.<br /><br />The strength of Montville's meticulously written book is that any random chapter is equally fascinating, whether it's about baseball, World War II or Korea, Williams' active role as a Sears spokesman and board member, his fishing life, or his prolonged demise.  The baseball chapters are refreshingly free of prolonged statistical parsing.  The accuracy of many anecdotes is left up to the reader; the book, as fits a popular biography, is not footnoted, and it seems as if Montville relies heavily on probably embellished stories from Williams' acquaintances and their children.  This provides the same mythical air as in Creamer's book (and the Babe himself makes a ghostly cameo here as well).<br /><br />For my money, though, the creepiest, and therefore most memorable, part of the book is the final three chapters, covering Williams' troubled final eight years.  This equals the closing chapters of the Mo Berg book.  Montville, whose writing occasionally verged on the florid or melodramatic, has a clear intent here -- in an almost literary device, he introduces John-Henry Williams to the story by way of voiceover.  John-Henry did not provide an interview for the book, and was dead by the time it hit the stores.  His lone representation comes from his lawyers, who spend more time assailing his betrayed half-sister Bobbie-Jo Ferrell than in justifying (or even explaining) his unusual actions.  Therefore, you can't walk away from this book with any ounce of sympathy for John-Henry.  I tried to feel sorry for him at the end, truth be told.  Almost did, but not quite.<br /><br />Ted Williams' head in a freezer.  There's more to the story than just that -- Montville spends most of three chapters covering the extended decline and fall of John-Henry's media empire, and sometimes seems to go out of his way to find people to declare John-Henry a creep even based on limited interaction from two decades ago.  However, Montville allows another creepy, ghoulish episode -- one of Ted's nurses declaring that she delivered him to Jesus and saved his soul, even while Ted was near to death and, based on other evidence in the book, long past his final moments of lucidity -- without the critical comment it so richly deserved.  John-Henry was not the only one trying to write himself into the Williams legacy.<br /><br />While the last three chapters are dark, \\"Death of a Salesman\\" dark, the epilogue, a selection of Williams anecdotes, will definitely bring a smile.  Now out on the market is a book and audio CD from John Underwood, who co-wrote Williams' own books.

Jose Canseco is simply telling us what's been floating around the ether for a couple of years.  Pete's book was poorly received, and apart from set back his Hall of Fame campaign about twenty years, didn't really change the baseball world. <br /> <br />What Canseco does differently, what Rose couldn't have done, is incriminate other bold-faced names.  Pete Rose didn't drop out of the sky and tell us that Ron Oester was a compulsive March Madness hustler, or that the late Bo Diaz liked to bet 75% of his salary on the horses.  Rose didn't tell us, 25 years later, that the only reason he caught Bob Boone's dropped pop-up to save the 1980 World Series was because Boone was into him for 20 large. <br /> <br />Canseco, however, names names.  He puts himself in the men's room stall, shooting up Mark McGwire, Juan Gonzalez, Rafael Palmeiro (no mention of Viagra though).  He relates quote-unquote verbatim conversations with Bret Boone, Roger Clemens, Wilson Alvarez.  He talks about syringes and pill combinations and takes credit for saving baseball after the 1994 strike (while pummeling Cal Ripken, for some reason).  He relates innuendo about big names like Brady Anderson and little ones like Tony Saunders.  He's got a chapter title: \\"Giambi: The Most Obvious Juicer in the Game\\", for crying out loud.  This is really controversial stuff! <br /> <br />The problem is, it's unprovable.  It has the ring of truth, of course.  You could even come up with an arbitrary number and say that if, oh, 20 percent of the allegations in the book are true, that heads should roll and record books should be rewritten.  Good for Mike Greenwell, for example, demanding that he be retroactively awarded the 1988 AL MVP.  It's great to see Mike Greenwell's name in the papers again, and we can thank Jose for that. <br /> <br />Along the way, Jose not only admits his steroid use, but revels init.  Some of his enthusing about the steroids of the future sounds suspiciously like an essay on eugenics.  I wouldn't want to live in that kind of world, and I say that as someone who wore a Jose Canseco T-shirt in high school even when I weighed, at the time, about as much as a handful of his bats. <br /> <br />That's the first book, the scandal stuff.  It's entertaining, even if unlikely.  However, the second book -- the baseball biography part -- is abysmal. <br /> <br />You've already read the effective factual debunking on ESPN.com: Jose attributes to himself a 450-foot homer actually hit by Mark McGwire.  He talks about striking out in Game Six of the five-game 2000 World Series.  He tell us that he \\"owned\\" Andy Pettitte from the batter's box, and that seems to be true, at least.  However, he talks about discussing 'roids with Bret Boone after hitting a double in Spring Training 2001, and we all know now that, far from not even hitting a double that spring, he never even reached second base. <br /> <br />Even more disturbing is the complete lack of interest in baseball details.  Here's a man who played in four World Series.  He hit a grand slam in the legendary Game One of the '88 Series.  He played in the humiliating sweep against the Reds in 1990.  He played alongside Reggie Jackson and Wade Boggs.  He played for the Boston Red Sox one October.  And yet, there are so few anecdotes, apart from those involving steroids.  Nothing about how he felt when Kirk Gibson's home run sailed into the stands?  Nothing about watching Eric Davis rip up his kidney on Cincinnati's Astroturf?  Nothing about Clemens throwing the bat at Piazza? <br /> <br />Maybe this is attributable to the lack of an identifiable co-author.  Even David Wells' muckraking 2003 biography provided plenty of game details, thanks to some obvious research.  Canseco's book, from a baseball sense, is relatively flyweight.  The only time he gives us details, he gets them wrong.  In this day and age, ittakes maybe 45 seconds to verify memories against a boxscore, if you've got a broadband connection and you've heard of Retrosheet.  Canseco's book, when it comes to game stories, is as embarrasingly wrong as Andre Dawson's or Kenny Kaiser's. <br /> <br />So, there you go.  Two books in one.  A titillating expose and a lousy baseball life story.  Again, if 20% of it is true, this will be Earth-shaking stuff.  Unfortunately, right now, we can't even guarantee that it's 10% true.	2005-02-22
US	51345392	R7IUDWOFFHKF9	044024157X	817294609	The Last Juror	Books	4	2	3	N	N	The First Non-Lawyer	Although John Grisham has followed the likes of James Patterson and David Baldacci in recent years, and successfully moved away from the formula that made him rich, it wasn't until I'd read 50 pages or so of \\"The Last Juror\\" that I finally got the joke.  Although sold as a legal thriller -- the front cover illustration on the paperback edition is a jury deliberation room -- this book does not have a lawyer as a protagonist.  And there is no $30 million at stake, driving the characters' motivation.  This is new ground for Grisham: a legal thriller, without the lawyers. <br /> <br />What follows in this book will test your devotion to the Grisham legal thriller formula.  He is not interested in plot this time around: although the back cover sells the book as the story of a jury being killed off, member by member, nine years after their deliberation in a sensational Southern murder trial, you will have read 400 of the book's first 475 pages before any juror actually dies.  And while the various Clanton, Mississippi characters will be familiar from older Grisham novels (slovenly divorce lawyer Harry Rex Vonner -- the soul of Joe Don Baker in the body of Oliver Platt -- shows up for at least his third Grisham outing), the main character is a Northern journalist who accidentally finds himself publishing a small town weekly.  The novel's title character is an older black woman who unwittingly winds up as the keystone figure in Clanton's long-overdue integration. <br /> <br />That's really all you need to know about \\"The Last Juror\\".  You already know that a lot of space will be devoted to descriptions of Southern food and religious practices.  Grisham writes with his usual flurry of self-contained chapters, so that you can finish the book in literally a few hours if you have a mind to.  He doesn't mind digressing -- the action stops dead about 50 pages before the end, when our journalist hero tries to block Wal-Mart from colonizing Clanton.  And you'll also be able to figure out who done it long before the author tells you. <br /> <br />The bottom line is standard fare for Grisham, but with a twist.  The blurb for his forthcoming hardcover also appears to advertise a book without a lawyer protagonist.  However, you need not be afraid that Grisham is losing his touch with what made him famous: \\"The Last Juror\\" is still classic Grisham, even without the lawyers and the guns and the money.	2005-01-02
US	51345392	R27PGPJEVDXWX4	0156029715	250407107	October Men: Reggie Jackson, George Steinbrenner, Billy Martin, and the Yankees' Miraculous Finish in 1978	Books	4	2	4	N	N	January-through-December Men	I've read a lot of Roger Kahn, but by no means all of his work.  However, when some wag columnist on ESPN.com rated this book a \\"0\\" last year, I knew I would have to step up and defend it.  The \\"0\\" rating didn't seem to be so much a reflection on the quality of the book, but rather a shot across the bow at an older style of baseball writing.  Well, I've read the new postscript to Michael Lewis' \\"Moneyball\\".  What is the man so annoyed about?  He wrote the bestselling baseball book of 2003, and he spends 20 pages in the new edition sniping at (and naming) his critics.  When that's on the menu, let me read the dinosaur instead.<br />That said, \\"October Men\\" is not a \\"10\\" either.  The back cover blurb promises \\"the first in-depth look\\" at the '78 Yankees.  Let's amend that to \\"the tenth in-depth look\\".  A lot has been written about the Steinbrenner/Martin Yankees -- Kahn even lists all the other books, and rates them.  Most of the anecdotes in \\"October Men\\" have been told before.<br />Still, the whole book manages to be rather charming.  Kahn spends the first few chapters describing his favorite baseball moments going back to 1903.  He writes a lot about the early years of the key players in the saga (Martin, Steinbrenner, Jackson), and spends a few chapters on the 1977 Yankees as well.  Editorially, this book could have been tighter.  Kahn twice refers to the same W.P. Kinsella story, twice describes Lou Piniella as \\"the best slow outfielder in baseball\\", and twice has Yankees VP Al Rosen scowling at Roy Cohn on October 2, 1978.  He also can't decide whether that date was Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur.<br />Kahn's writing style manages to be persuasive.  Unlike the newer breed of baseball writers, he is more apt to drop literary allusions and verses from poetry.  No surprise; Kahn's mother was an English teacher -- in fact, was my father's English teacher -- so all this is familiar.  It's not enough for Kahn to say that the media is the Fourth Estate; he gives us the origin of the line, too.  He also expounds on what it means to \\"cross the Rubicon\\", thus making Julius Caesar, for the first time ever, a central player in a baseball narrative.  In the end, Kahn's goal is to transform what's now known as \\"The Bucky Dent Game\\" into a sweeping look at all of the currents in 1978 leading to that moment.<br />The problem is, Kahn has done better before.  His reconstruction of the 1920s for his Jack Dempsey biography (speaking of which, Dempsey is referred to about eleven times in \\"October Men\\") gives an overview of everything else about the 1920s, as if he was there.  He's less concerned with talking about the \\"real\\" 1978, apart from a few stray Jimmy Carter references.  This is not the paean to Ronald Reagan that was \\"Miracle\\", infusing a year (1980) with political overtones that weren't recognized at the time.  Nor is this a sociological portrait of the end of an era, as was Michael Shapiro's \\"The Last Good Season\\" about Brooklyn in 1956.  This is just a look at what it was like to read New York City newspapers in 1978.  Kahn even takes his own Michael Lewis-style potshots at the other writers of the day, including the villainous Dick Young, and makes himself a central player in a few key scenes in the book (as a confidante of Jackson, Martin, and Al Rosen).<br />Bottom line: can you learn more about the '78 Yankees from this book than you can from watching the Bucky Dent game on ESPN Classic or the YES Network?  Yes, you can (although you should watch the game, too).  Is \\"October Men\\" the kind of book that will no longer be written in ten years time?  Yes, it is.  Is it worth reading now?  Yes, it is.	2004-04-03

Books	1	45	109	N	N	But where's the research?	There's a page and a half in this book on Social Security disability.  It's an example, Stossel says, of government giveaway gone amok.  To prove this, he spends a paragraph each interviewing two drug addicts he met waiting on line at a Social Security office in San Francisco.  That must have been the extent of his research.<br />If he, or his researchers, had gone on to investigate the Social Security disability programs, that section, those carelessly tossed 300 words, would never have wound up in the book.  Not if this book was supposed to be the result of hard-hitting investigative journalism.<br />First of all, Social Security turns down more than half of all of its applicants.  Unless you're over 50, the program simply isn't designed for you.  Their approval and denial stats are posted right on the SSA website, so it takes 45 seconds to locate.  Stossel didn't uncover that website in his research.  How could you miss that, if you're trying to sell a story?<br />Second, more importantly, addiction is not a disability for SSA purposes.  If addiction is the material cause of your disability, you don't get Social Security money.  That's the law, and that's coming from Congress.  No matter what two people waiting on line in San Francisco (it had to be San Francisco, didn't it?) said.<br />Most of the SSD section, however, is anti-lawyer hysteria.  The final 60% of that section is railing on about lawyers suing people for money.  What does that have to do with people applying for disability to reclaim money they paid into the system during their working lives?  It's a non-sequitur.<br />The section are carelessly written.  They're not based on fact, or research, or investigation.  That story could never have aired on 20/20.  This casts doubts on much of the rest of the book.  Perhaps, rather, Stossel should investigate why the government makes it so hard to get Disability, rather than paint scary pictures of drug addicts feeding at the Democrats' trough.	2004-03-29

It would be hokey to say that I learned more from the Times in Tuesday's Metro section than I did from every other article, op-ed and feature throughout the rest of the week.  But it's also true.<br />I love New York City, and I love the subway.  It wasn't always that way -- I voluntarily fled the tri-state area at age 17 to go to college in points south, and later in points midwest.  I came running back to the city eight years later, a victim of the fact that Toledo's bus system stops running at 5 PM and on Sundays, and am never leaving again.  The subway is now the backbone of my NYC experience.  For $70 a month I can take unlimited rides from the southernmost corners of Brooklyn, all the way to Union Square or the Upper East Side.  Without having to save 15% or more on car insurance from GEICO.<br />Every weekly &quot;Tunnel Vision&quot; column, several of which are reprinted for this book (sadly without the original photography) is either educational or, more importantly, hilarious.  The most memorable columns discuss those who opt to spend their lives in the subway: as employees, performers, or, sometimes, residents.  Several columns are also devoted to the rats and pigeons (if there is a difference between the two) who are an integral part of the city's 468 stations -- even more so than the vanishing token booth clerk.<br />No contemporary book about the city would be complete without a collection of columns about 9/11.  Kennedy interview the motorman who drove under the towers as the first plane struck.  He inspects the damage done to the tunnels after the buildings fell.  He even found the man whose job it was to update the official subway map as each line reopened.<br />Everyone has a subway story and, of course, not all of them could be covered in this book.  I've love to know more, for example, about the group of men on the Broadway line who burst into cars and announce &quot;Do you know what time it is? It's doo-wop time!&quot;.  I would like to know why, while riding uptown on the Lexington Avenue line after seeing the final &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; picture, one of my traveling companions was assaulted by a man dressed as a horse, who proceeded to gallop away down the car.  I would even, heavens preserve us, like to know more about the most hated man in New York City: the guy who recorded the 200-decibel &quot;Stand clear of the closing doors, please!&quot; announcement that plagues the newest cars on the IRT lines and the L train.  Does he ever ride the train, cover his ears at every station stop, and mourn, &quot;What have I done?  What have I done?&quot;	2004-03-27
US	51345392	R1VD2HNPOIFNGJ	0452284163	557461421	Skipping Towards Gomorrah: The Seven Deadly Sins and the Pursuit of Happiness in America	Books	4	7	7	N	N	The Savage Nation	If anything disappoints about \\"Skipping Toward Gomorrah\\", it's the fact that Dan Savage really could have stretched two books from this material.  On the one hand, it's a disarming travelogue through America's heartland (Texas, Iowa, Illinois) and introducing us to a cheerfully diverse group of American citizens celebrating their pursuit of happiness.  On the other hand, Savage is trying to write a great liberal memoir, to counter the suffocating glut of right-wing manifestos by every low-end-of-the-AM-bandwidth pundit with a book deal.<br />So what's wrong with putting those two ideas together?  Nothing!  As it turns out, squeaky-voiced radio rightist Glenn Beck just did a similar book from the opposite perspective.  Now, if only Savage had his own radio show... we could call it... \\"The Savage Nation\\"!<br />Oh, wait.<br />\\"Gomorrah\\" (titled after a dreary Robert Bork volume from the Regnery Press-happy mid '90s) loosely follows the Seven Deadly Sins, and shows how well-adjusted, law abiding Americans can live at what's considered the \\"edge\\" of decency and still live productive lives.  To demonstrate how Savage truly has his finger on the pulse of our culture, two issues in this book exploded into the national consciousness after it was published: Bill Bennett's gambling (his name features heavily in the \\"Greed\\" chapter), and gay marriage.<br />As is appropriate for this kind of book, the chapters are written so that they can be read separately.  I was most amused by \\"Envy\\", a trip to a Zan-themed weight-loss-for-the-rich boot camp in the hills overlooking Cher's house, and \\"Greed\\", a visit to a Z-grade casino in Iowa, reminiscent of an unexpected encounter with a slots machine I had in Shreveport last spring.  Less amusing were \\"Sloth\\", perhaps because I don't share Dan's enthusiasm for the weed, and \\"Anger\\", the chapter set in the gun store.  Downright horrifying, however, was the \\"Sloth\\" chapter.  Even the thinnest among us will want to diet after reading about the wheelchair-bound 40 year-olds at the NAAFA convention, who are proud of the fact that they're too heavy to walk anymore.  The amusing coda is set in Manhattan, where Savage rents a call girl for $3000 just to interview her... and turns around the next day to rent her boyfriend, who's in the same line of work.<br />Along the way, Bork, Bennett and Ann Coulter are happily dismantled.  The so-called culture war that imploded the Republican convention in Houston in 1992, has returned with a vengeance in 2004, with the only difference that this time, no-one's standing up against it.  Voices like Dan's are an oasis in the wilderness.  When he's not busy obsessing over VCR-player-sized wedges of chocolate cake, that is.	2004-03-20
US	51345392	RWZJJXXRIGT8Y	0743417682	124087136	From a Buick 8	Books	4	2	2	N	N	The longest ghost story ever told.	This one is about half the length of &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, so I was actually able to finish, but I think I had the same fundamental problem with both books.  King's grasp on how people speak to each other is slipping further and further into one of those creepy alternate dimensions he always writes about.  This is a novel told in flashback, with a few narrators who all have the same &quot;voice&quot; -- their paragraphs all go on for a couple of sentences longer than they should have in real life.<br />Case in point: when the Pennsylvania State Trooper sergeant, who's the principal storyteller, finally gets thirsty on page 100, his communications officer miraculously arrives bearing a pitcher of iced tea -- and a tray of sandwiches for the boys.  Not only that, but she delivers a speech about how men love to drink, and how men love to eat, and how women like the food and the drink too, and, oh, by the way, skinny kid, you need to eat at least two of these sandwiches.<br />One of the things I've always liked about Stephen King in the nearly twenty years I've been reading his books is that he juxtaposes horrific situations wtih genuine, down to Earth people.  But in &quot;From a Buick 8&quot;, the characters (all of them state troopers, or related to state troopers) rapidly become a cloying bunch of law enforcement cliches.  The first half of the book contains about a million variations on the concept that troopers can only trust each other, and that they're a family, and that single troopers are married to the troop, and... you see where this is going.<br />Another point is that our expectation of how books and movies capture &quot;real&quot; speech has changed in the last ten years: with the demise of moralizing sitcom speeches, and the emergence of Tarantino-style screenplay and &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.<br />The basic story behind &quot;From A Buick 8&quot; is really creepy, as only King can provide.  The monsters are just around the corner, so you can't see them right away.  All you start with is the sense that this Buick doesn't belong... it looks like a car on the surface, but when you look closer, the details don't add up.  The detailing is wrong, the car doesn't get dirty, the driver vanished.  This sense of reality warping is one King visited many times, in different ways: Leland Gaunt in &quot;Needful Things&quot;, the vans in &quot;The Regulators&quot;, and the Dark Tower passages in &quot;Insomnia&quot; (if not the whole of the Dark Tower series itself!).  Horror is not vampires and demonic clowns and foul-mouthed spirits: it's about the sense that your very down-to-Earth life is being invaded by your nightmares.<br />But, every time the horror starts to generate some traction, the real-life stuff gets in the way.  There's a character with an Armenian surnmae (Arkanian), but the guy's actually Swedish, and not only are all his lines written in dialect, but so is the chapter that he narrates!  This drives a stake into the heart of credibility as much as, say, Kevin Costner's accent in &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;.  There's also a glaring continuity error (about what a particular character was wearing when he disappeared) once our heros finally get to look through the Buick at what lies on the other side.<br />&quot;From a Buick 8&quot; was not an unabashedly enjoyable read.  I found myself fighting the State Troopers and their Shakespearian, or Tom Hanksian, ethos.  We few, we cloying few, we band of brothers.  I don't remember having that reaction to Sherrif Pangborn's crew in &quot;Needful Things&quot;.  Since the characters are really what &quot;From A Buick 8&quot; is about -- how it takes a family united to beat back a menace -- it didn't help my appreciation of the book when I started rooting for the bad guys to win.	2004-03-16

You always remembered where you were when you heard a Johnny Cash song for the first time.  One warm spring day in late May, I drove 180 miles across East Texas (from Nacogdoches to Dallas) in one morning, surrounded by tall, tall trees, and towns with names like Gun Barrel City.  The only three minutes of that drive I can still recall are the final three minutes of &quot;One Piece at a Time&quot;, which played on AM radio and which I'd never heard before.  It's a comical story song, but I was sitting there behind the wheel, really curious to find out if this guy was ever going to build his Cadillac.  I've since heard the song at least a hundred times.<br />No, this didn't happen decades ago.  I made that drive in May 2003.<br />The thing is, you could always discover Johnny Cash.  For example, the only visit I've ever made to an adult toy store in my life was brightened by the sounds of the Johnny Cash box set emanating from the store speakers.  I picked up his &quot;American IV: The Man Comes Around&quot; album just a week before he died, and was captivated equally by his old, defiant Westerns (&quot;Sam Hall&quot;) and the thoughtful, late November covers by non-country artists (&quot;Hurt&quot;, &quot;In My Life&quot;).  The punchline of the album, though, was the final track: &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot;.<br />&quot;Cash: The Autobiography&quot; is an audiobook in print.  The Man narrates scenes from his life as he's writing (1996-1997): a concert in Santa Cruz, trying out his cover of Soundgarden's &quot;Rusty Cage&quot;; afternoons at his homes in Tennessee, Florida and Jamaica; and cruising for Walmarts in rural Wisconsin.<br />Interspersed with those snapshots are the longer reminiscences of the people, places and songs in his life.  These stories are told in no set order, but they're a good source of the anecdotes that are the raison d'etre of celeb bios.  Cash spends a lot of time on the birth of rockabilly at Sun Records in Memphis; a lot more time on his battles with amphetamine addictions and rehab; a discussion of the significance of religion in his life (watch for the story about the boy in the church on Central Park South in New York City) and cataloguing his friendships with rock and country icons alike.<br />This all came out in 1997.  One could be forgiven for hanging up his guitar at age 65.  Cash, however, burned across the music scene right up through his final months.  So &quot;Cash: The Autobiography&quot; is far from a final chapter.  The video for &quot;Hurt&quot; is a fitting postscript, with its ghostly cameo by June Carter, and its black-and-white footage of Cash's boyhood home in Dyess, Arkansas.<br />Johnny Cash truly was all things to all people.  This book is not ideal as an introduction to his legacy -- you'll need to know his songs before he talks about them -- but it's certainly a good representation of what he was about.  And he was about... everything.	2004-02-29
US	51345392	R2XAFGGBT7VYLM	1566635527	307021135	A Legend in the Making: The New York Yankees in 1939	Books	4	3	3	N	N	The last days of Gehrig	He only had 28 at-bats in 1939 before famously ending his streak of 2,130 consecutive games played, but Lou Gehrig casts a long shadow over &quot;A Legend in the Making&quot;, which chronicles the Yankees season from April through October.  I was surprised to learn, for instance, that Gehrig continued to travel with the Yankees long after learning of his death sentence -- and long after the July 4th &quot;luckiest man&quot; speech at Yankee Stadium.  As &quot;Legend in the Making&quot; proves, Gehrig continued to travel with the team in uniform, and was even present throughout the World Series in New York and Cincinnati.  I never knew that before.<br />&quot;Legend in the Making&quot; is at times a throwback to the old school of baseball non-fiction, describing a single season with occasional reference to social and historical goings-on.  It's similar to Robert Creamer's volume on 1941, or David Halberstam's books about the summer of '49 and October '64.  The difference is that Richard Tofel focusses exclusively on the team he argues is the greatest in baseball history: the '39 Yankees.<br />In another sense, &quot;Legend&quot; is also a work of progressive baseball analysis, influenced by the research of Bill James, and the writing staff of ESPN.com (primarily Rob Neyer).  The book is willing to debunk a few myths, such as the one about Gehrig voluntarily quitting the linuep.  Some newly-favored statistical measure are used to distinguish the Yankees from their hailed 1927 counterparts.  There's a lot of discussion about when Gehrig may first have gotten sick, including a discussion about the little-known 1938 Western in which he starred.  Tofel breaks down his '38 statistics month by month to look for evidence that the ALS may have set in by mid-summer.  The answer? probably not.<br />&quot;Legend&quot; breezes from month to month, anecdote to anecdote, and makes for a satisfying read.  Player biographies are mixed in with game descriptions, although sometimes a sharper editorial hand would have been welcome.  The description of Opening Day, for example, is interrupted three or four times to tell us about certain key players, so that it seemingly takes forever for Red Ruffing to pitch his shutout.  Elden Auker's nostalgic &quot;Sleeper Cards and Flannel Uniforms&quot; is cited in the biography, but an eerie Gehrig story retold in that book did not make its way into this one.<br />The 1939 World Series is not the best known Fall Classic.  It is not easy to make a four-game sweep seem suspenseful, especially when the Cincinnati Reds held a lead for only a few innings in one game.  Tofel, however, does a good job recreating a lost world, in which Series games didn't sell out, and were played in sunshine in under two hours.<br />Tofel shows how the media reported the 1939 season from day to day.  Before the revelation that Gehrig had ALS, we see newspaper columnists deriding his play.  Not everyone present in the Stadium for his speech was aware he was dying.  The most stunning revelation?  That, before the '39 season, the Yankees forced Gehrig to take a pay cut.  That revelation alone is worth the cover price.	2004-02-21

The back cover blurb for BOP04 asks four questions about where candidates get their funding: the answer to two of those questions is &quot;Joe Lieberman&quot;.<br />&quot;Buying of the President 2004&quot; runs nearly 500 pages, and I can honestly say I learned something new on nearly every page.    The book begins with a series of three loosely connected essays about the state of the American electoral system, surveying the wreckage of the 2000 campaign (from the Bush teams coyly racist ploy to subvert John McCain in Arizona), to the 2000 election aftermath (you'll be surprised at the extent of voter disfranchisement in Florida), to which major corporations fund which parties.  Most shocking is that News Corp -- the people who brought you Fox News Channel -- rank among the Democrats' top 50 donors over the last quarter century, but not among the Republicans'.  BOP04 names the corporate names, and provides the dollar figures.<br />The second portion of the book is the political expose on President Bush -- from his New England birth and sheltered Yale education, to his disastrous years as an oil magnate, to his riding ownership of the Texas Rangers all the way to the Governor's mansion and beyond.  His presidency is coolly dissected, contribution by contribution, dollar by dollar.  You will feel positively unclean after reading these chapters, especially if you voted for him based solely on his debate platform and his &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; campaign talk.<br />But, BOP04 is not merely partisan slash work.  The ten declaredDemocratic presidential candidates for 2004 are also taken apart by the same dispassionate, and at times sarcastic, eye.  The most interesting chapters detail Dennis Kucinich's rocky political career, and Al Sharpton's bizarre financial dealings.  The chapters on John Kerry and John Edwards are most significant now.  Neither candidate is revealed to be special-interest-free.  These chapters come highly recommended, especially as a lot of this information is still not well known out on the stumps.<br />The book's conclusion is grim.  The writing begins to get carried away, especially with the reference to Todd Beamer on the final two pages.  They'd already made their point quite clearly through the previous 500 pages.  It's hard to wrestle with the facts and dollar signs presented in this book.  The real question of the election season then, is not &quot;Is my candidate truly indepedent?&quot;, but rather, &quot;Am I comfortable with giving my candidate's financial backers access to the Oval Office?&quot;<br />That may not be what the Founding Fathers envisioned (or maybe it is).  Reading BOP04 did not cause me to change the lever I will pull in my party's primary (or in November), but I do feel a much more informed citizen for having read it.	2004-02-19
US	51345392	R3319NXQKMTUQB	0743255453	937109510	The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	4	8	11	N	Y	Don't trust anyone under "43"	Paul O'Neill is a millionaire and a big-time corporate CEO.  He's a fiscally conservative Republican whose counsel was sought by every U.S. President from Nixon to Clinton.  He came to Washington at the invitation of his old friend Dick Cheney to be Secretary of the Treasury -- the man trusted to sign the dollar bill.<br />That was his first mistake.<br />\\"The Price of Loyalty\\" is a meticulously detailed work.  Not O'Neill's autobiography per se, it's a work of investigatory journalism by the Wall Street Journal's Ron Suskind, given full access not only to O'Neill, but to all of his work-product (schedules, memos, personal notes) from two years in the Bush White House.<br />Because the Bush presidency is best known for its obsessive secrecy, it's former CEO O'Neill's devotion to transparency that caused his ouster from Washington.  To read this account of his too-short Cabinet tenure is to understand how one of America's most influential (albeit behind-the-scenes) Republicans become heartbroken at the direction the country took under George W. Bush.  This is \\"Bush 43\\" as painted by his top fiscal advisor -- a man who preached budgetary responsibility, and who therefore first drew reproving stares from the political right for praising Bill Clinton's monetary policies.<br />O'Neill reveals everything: from Bush's inability to ask questions in one-on-one meetings, to the primacy of his political advisors (Karl Rove, Larry Lindsey) over policy men (O'Neill, Christy Todd Whitman, Colin Powell, Alan Greenspan), to his comical yet life-changing visit to Africa with Bono.  The book's major revelation is not that Bush's team planned to invade Iraq even before September 2001 -- that was basically an open secret, even though Bob Woodward did not report it that way in \\"Bush At War\\".  Rather, the most revealing tidbit in \\"The Price of Loyalty\\" is the composition of Cheney's secret energy policy task force, the identity of whose members had to be litigated in federal court.  O'Neill names names, and shows how that policy group was influenced solely by energy executives, without any input from environmental voices.<br />This book celebrates thought process and pragmatism.  O'Neill's thoughts and ideas are dense, his economics hard to interpret for the layman, but his dedication to hearing both sides is admirable.  His (increasingly shorter) briefs for the President argued both sides of a position, while still laying out a clear road map of where he wanted the President to go.  However, his ideas were abandoned by Bush's political men -- the ideologues, not the planners or thinkers.  But O'Neill was no mere policy wonk -- he was a radical executive who enjoyed making waves -- and the fact that he was chased from the Administration, does not speak well of the man who was elected to run it.<br />The final insult comes when Cheney -- not the President -- called to tell O'Neill he was out.  When O'Neill was offered the \\"amicable and gracious\\" chance to resign, he refused to offer the excuse that he was \\"returning to private life\\".  The next day, after submitting his resignation, O'Neill turned on CNBC and heard he'd been fired.  Not amicable.  Not gracious.	2004-02-17
US	51345392	R3LIITCCFIG0E8	0393322963	967454060	The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder	Books	4	19	20	N	N	Read this in October 2004	I confess I may not have purchased this book if I didn't recognize the author's name.  Mark Crispin Miller was a film professor at a Baltimore university when I was an undergrad well over a decade ago.   I enrolled in his lecture course and he helped make Stanley Kubrick a little less inscrutable, so I figured I'd give him a chance to deconstruct George W. Bush as well.<br />The &quot;Dyslexicon&quot; is three books in one.  The center book, of course, is a lengthy compendium of the unelected President's misquotes.  They're helpfully indexed by political issue.  There are all your old favorites (&quot;Families is where... wings take dream&quot;).  There are several quotes from Bush's own campaign autobiography (&quot;A Charge To Keep&quot;) which doesn't sound as if it was written by Bush at all.  Since the book contradicts his own views on turmoil at Yale in the late '60s, he probably didn't.  Most important, I think, are the lengthy passages from the three debates with Al Gore in late 2000 that probably won Bush the election (or rather, put him in a position to get selected by the Supreme Court).  For example, seeing in print how Gore dismantles Bush on issues such as affirmative action still had me scratching my head, just as I scratched my head in 2000 when the media declared that Bush &quot;won&quot; the debates.<br />The quotes, as I said, are the core of the book.  Around that is a lengthy media-science discourse on television news and how America as a nation selects their presidents.  This part of the book is a polemic, highly political, and I confess that I wasn't 100% on board with Miller's arguments.  However, his case is compellingly stated.  The point of publishing a book like this is to raise issues and engage discourse.  On that level it is a far higher quality of discussion than you would see from, say, Regnery Press, which is the preferred platform for those who spread Bushisms.<br />The final portion of the revised book is the post-9/11 material.This book came out shortly after Bush was inaugurated, but was updated rather sensibly to show the changing focus of Bush's administration and policies.  Miller deals well with the canonization of Bush after the tragedy, as spun by Ari Fleischer and Karl Rove.  Less successful is his final argument, presented on pages 325-332 as &quot;The Reason Why&quot;.  First of all, you don't want to go around quoting Noam Chomsky to explain why 9/11 happened.  There is a middle ground between the Chomsky and Bush views as to why America was selected for attack, but Miller doesn't stake it out.  Are these the opinions Miller would have endorsed had Al Gore been President in 2001?<br />In the end, though, Miller does an important job dissecting Bush's policies.  America was sold a bill of goods, electing the most radical President in a century, believing him to be a centrist.  Miller presents his unvarnished words, which are at turns laugh-out-loud funny, and deeply disturbing.  The middle book is the one you need to own, and the supporting essays are worth considering as well.	2004-02-13
US	51345392	R1E0EAXUDFV3FS	0563538589	80371704	The Suns of Caresh (Doctor Who)	Books	4	4	5	N	N	The Blurbs of Back-cover	You really can judge a book by its cover.  Specifically, by how much information the back cover blurb gives away.  &quot;The Space Age&quot; still remains best known, after nearly four years, for its wildly imaginative blurb, rather than for the warmed-over &quot;West Side Story&quot; coffee grounds we got within.  Not only is &quot;Divided Loyalties&quot; one of the worst novels published east of the Atlantic Ocean, but its blurb is doubly unimaginative -- spoiling, as it does, just about all of the story's major plot twists through page 200.<br />Now, when I read reviews of &quot;The Suns of Caresh&quot; online, I'm actually reading reviews of two different books.  There's the school of thought which celebrates &quot;Caresh&quot; as a nifty 80-page novella, set behind a largely unmemorable 200-page trailer.  But there's also the school of thought holding &quot;Caresh&quot; as 200 pages of an inventive science-fiction novel, let down by an 80-page coda that has little to do with the elaborate set-up.<br />I'm going to join the latter group, and say that &quot;Caresh&quot; had me right up until the page 200 mark -- or maybe page 149.  I believe that, if the back-cover blurb had been redone, I would not have felt that way.  The blurb really gives away the game all the way up through page 200, thus setting up the seemingly disconnected 80-page Caresh sequence.  We know going in that Troy Game &quot;is pinning her hopes on the Doctor&quot;, but she doesn't even meet him until well after the halfway point.  The effect of all this is that &quot;Saint&quot; has given us an inventive novel with loops and twists... but it just doesn't seem that way, since we know too much before we even start.<br />The book I enjoyed is not even hinted at on the back.  It's about an alien who falls from the sky and has to adjust to working-class England.  It's also the story of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;'s quintessential poor shlub, Simon Haldane, a factory worker with a strong SF bent, whose fantasy comes to life when the alien moves into his bedroom.  Simon believes her story and starts working with her (thanks to some nifty computer graphics that might've looked great on TV) to phone home.  The Doctor and Jo are a million miles away from all this, but it's OK.  Meanwhile, Simon has a problem... he's been so conditioned by the culture that all he can do is count down until the inevitable moment when the nympho alien, stranger in a strange land, will seduce him.  Only that never happens, and when Simon tries to (drunkenly) force the issue...<br />Meanwhile, the Doctor and Jo are getting involved in some Time Lord intrigue of the kind the EDAs can no longer provide.  There's a renegade Gallifreyan lording his scientific advances over another exotic alien planet.  There's his one-time consort, a Time Lady who (thankfully) is nothing like Iris Wildthyme.  The Doctor's on a rescue mission for the Time Lords, but this time, the CIA is not involved, and there are no men in funny hats telling him what to do.<br />The back cover blurb, naturally, ignores both these stories, and instead leads off with three oblique mysteries, all of which are incidental to the story I just described.  Meanwhile, Simon is casually tossed aside in a two-sentence parenthetical, thus giving him the PDA equivalent of Liz Shaw's departure scene in &quot;Inferno&quot;.<br />&quot;The Suns of Caresh&quot; is evocative Pertwee, with gadgets, a sympathetically-drawn Jo Grant, and interesting TARDIS mythology.  It's also, however, a victim of the six-part format that plagued stories like &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs&quot; and &quot;The Time Monster&quot;, as the shifting focus knocks the original story clear off the table and brings in something far less interesting to end the day.  Why couldn't Simon travel to Caresh?  Why is Masada mentioned on the blurb when we leave that locale for good on page 13?  When the Epilogue causes all of the story's Earthbound catastrophes to unhappen, whyisn't Simon brought back?<br />Anyway, these are first-novel excessives compounded by an editorial blunder.  &quot;Caresh&quot; is endlessly inventive and fairly readable.  Let's let this Saint pseudonym loose on the UNIT gang and see if we can't turn out anything better than &quot;Eye of the Giant&quot; or &quot;Amorality Tale&quot;.	2004-01-27
US	51345392	R31X9WTCP11MGT	0563538643	733127629	Heritage (Doctor Who)	Books	4	6	8	N	N	Clown Without Pity	This gorgeous color-illustrated coffee-table book by Abba Eban, along with the PBS documentary, tells the inspiring story of how a nomadic tribe prospered against incalculable odds and insurmountable foes, and made the desert bloom.  Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses, to Sandy Koufax...<br />Oh, wait.  Wrong &quot;Heritage&quot;.<br />&quot;Heritage&quot;, &quot;Doctor Who&quot; style, is a novel-length short story with the kind of aggressively off-putting cover illustration that has plagued the book line since its inception.  A scrawny, barefoot, sepia-colored child, squints at the reader, while a leering mouthful of teeth (think Coldheart or Return of the Jedi) gapes in the sand behind her.  Who wants to look at this?  Why sell 20,000 books, when you can sell 8,000?<br />Anyway, don?t be put off by the atrocious cover, or by the suffocating prose.  An old &quot;Doctor Who&quot; friend has been murdered, and Heritage is all about the aftermath.  Every scene is about how people reacts to that murder.  For example, I?ve just finished with the Season 3 box set of &quot;Homicide&quot;.  After actor Jon Polito was fired following Season 2, an early Season 3 episodes &quot;?Crosetti&quot;) was entirely dedicated to the aftermath of his character?s suicide.  That?s a bold move, and it?s an effective episode.  &quot;Heritage&quot; follows the same funereal theme.  The only difference is that Crosetti?s body was discovered at the start of Act One.  Here, we don?t learn the body?s identity until page 110, so it takes a while to realize we?re supposed to care.<br />What takes Dale Smith 280 pages to tell could have been done in &quot;Crosetti&quot;?s 48 minutes.  The villain is not the anatomical beast featured on the cover, but rather a mad scientist who?d have been well-played by some Philip Madoc type on TV.  There?s also a Clifton James-type Wild West sheriff, a cyborg bartender evidently played by Brendan Gleeson, and a 61st-century dolphin reminiscent of the gangster shark demon from a Season 6 episode of &quot;Buffy&quot;.  This is a good small cast.  The Doctor figures out who?s good and who?s bad in a hurry, and everyone gets their just deserts (as opposed to &quot;desserts&quot;).  Except for the dolphin, whose fate is not specified.  What happens to him after he doesn?t die?  Maybe there wasn?t enough room to say, as if the author couldn?t have omitted three chapters full of descriptions of red sand.<br />Really, I needed to rinse my mouth out after reading &quot;Heritage&quot;.  The descriptions of the desert sand mount toward silly proportions, like the out-of-control descriptions of snow in &quot;Drift&quot;.  Anyone who?s read the Dust portions of &quot;Interference&quot; has already tread this ground.<br />The subplot is the ongoing 7th Doctor-Ace conflict.  References are made to most of the Season 25 and 26 McCoy/Aldred series, so this takes place after &quot;Survival&quot;.  There?s no explicit mention to the Tucker/Perry Season 27 &quot;arc&quot;; nor is there reference to &quot;Relative Dementias&quot;, which presumably predated Tucker/Perry.  The Doctor does make reference, somewhere among all the red sand, to a storm coming.  Is that the Timewyrm?  Or the TV-movie?  Honestly, I can?t tell if the New Adventures are even supposed to have taken place anymore.  People keep piling more and more stories in between &quot;Survival&quot; and &quot;Love and War&quot;.  At this point you?d think Ace traveled with the Seventh Doctor for thirty years.  Anyway, if 7th Doctor angst hadn?t already been the subject of literally 70 other books, this would?ve been satisfying.  Instead, like the characters in the desert, it keeps treading the same old ground.<br />Another weird narrative trick is the use of epigraphs.  I mean, one chapter ends with a revelation about the tow-headed child on the cover.  The very next page gives us a quote from her autobiography, which spoils the ending of the book, telling us, asit does, that she?s not going to die, and also who's going to adopt her.  A later chapter ends on a mini-cliffhanger, as one character contemplates suicide in an abandoned mineshaft.  On the next page, however, Smith gives us his obituary, 14 years hence.  And then goes back to resolve the cliffhanger a chapter later.  Remember how the US sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot; used to solve its characters problems by setting its final scene six months in the future to show how everyone wound up happy again?  Of course you don?t.  No one remembers &quot;Growing Pains&quot;.  Anyway, don?t do it again, guys.<br />What I took away from &quot;Heritage&quot;, apart from dry mouth, was a sense of justice.  Ended, finally, is the old Virgin/BBC/Short Trips trend of killing off Dodo, Liz or Sarah Jane, or showing us how miserable Barbara, Victoria, Jo, Romana, Nyssa, Tegan, Peri and Mel were after leaving the TARDIS.  Here, finally, when an old friend is killed off, the Doctor swoops in furiously and makes the situation right.  Believe it or not, he?s never really done that before.  Thank you, Doctor.	2004-01-23
US	51345392	R2ZS9CLPOZ9TYM	0563538554	318244928	Combat Rock (Doctor Who)	Books	4	8	8	N	N	You've been used by a toadstool!	This is a book about cannibals. It's about savagery and terrorism, blood and grist and, roughly five thousand corpses. On the rain-forest archipelago of the planet Jenggel, the primitive natives of the island Papul are returning to their cannibalistic ways, after the mummified corpses of their ancient tribal leaders return to life. On the &quot;pleasure island&quot; of Batu, seven punk-rock hit men are gathering, on orders from Jenggel's President, to kill a lot of people and thus justify the President's naked power grab. In the opening teaser (which is never connected up to the rest of the book), a soldier impliedly murders a woman and her baby, and that's pretty much the lightest moment on offer.<br />Author Lewis gives us a detailed setting: we learn the names of all the islands, and their major cities; we learn how the inhabitants of each island are different from one another. There are discourses on commerce, trade, and leisure. I started reading all this while on a business trip in Puerto Rico, so the tourist in me was satisfied.<br />Lewis is the anarchist of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; range. His previous book, &quot;Rags&quot; was about a punk rock band whose music kills. That one I bought in a graveyard, in the World Trade Center Borders in the summer of 2001. &quot;Combat Rock&quot; is about what you'd expect from the author of &quot;Rags&quot;: 100% downbeat from start to finish, with no sympathy or mercy spared for anybody.  Lewis's lone moment of generosity comes from sparing the lives of two members of the guest cast.<br />Once you desensitize, and let the blood and gore wash gently over you, there are interesting things to be learned about the Second Doctor and his Season 5 companions, Jamie and Victoria. Victoria, whose TV portrayal was all about compassion and screaming, is revealed to be a bit of a Victorian-era rebel. She has an interesting relationship with a loyal native soldier, before the inevitable happens to him. Jamie is more hormone-dominated in &quot;Combat Rock&quot; than he ever was on TV, but he does pull off a very clever gambit in the final chapter, to escape becoming the dinner course at a cannibal's house.<br />The Doctor is vivid, unusual for the Patrick Troughton books, which generally have no idea what to do with his character. The definitive TV Troughton moment came in &quot;Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;, when he inflated the ego of the villainous Klieg by shouting increasingly frantic praise... only to pull back slyly and murmur &quot;Now I know you're mad. I just wanted to make sure.&quot; There are several moments in &quot;Combat Rock&quot; similar to that ethos, although most of them are limited to the final three chapters -- earlier in the book, the Doctor is annoyingly passive, refusing to dive out of a boat to save a companion from monster-infested water. Once he finally confronts the psi-powered menace on Papul who's responsible for the bloodbath, he is in full Troughton form, uttering a line so wonderful I wish Troughton were still alive to record it: &quot;You've been used by a toadstool!&quot;<br />The plot is competently done. The bulk of the story is lite Conrad: a jungle trek on foot and by canoe, to meet the depraved toadstool-junkie Krallik. In that party are not one, but two, people, who are not what they seem. Most of the seemingly random bits of butchery (a missionary watching his star pupil come back to eat him, for example) do connect back to the overall plot, even if many of the characters don't get to meet the Doctor before dying horribly.<br />You will benefit from reading the author bio and acknowledgements first.  Lewis tells us that most of the story is drawn from real-life Earth locales and events, and that at least two of the supporting cast are based on his friends.<br />If you have a high splatter quotient -- if you've been cheerfully desensitized to the sight of intestines and brains thanks to month after month of these &quot;Doctor Who&quot; books, and if youdon't mind being seen toting a book with such a violent, charmless cover -- there's a good addition to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; universe waiting to be read. Here's a book that takes risks: the lone continuity reference is Victoria noting that her hit-man captive is worse than the Daleks. And, because &quot;Combat Rock&quot; is so tightly woven, you actually believe her.	2004-01-01
US	51345392	R1RDNUVW1V4FXZ	0440241537	106527389	The King of Torts	Books	4	0	1	N	N	The Grish Get Grisher	After \\"The Chamber\\", you can separate John Grisham's annual legal thrillers into two categories:<br />A) Rich lawyers who stumble upon millions of dollars, and<BR>B) Poor lawyers who stumble upon millions of dollars.<br />The amount of millions in each novel may vary -- $50 million in \\"The Rainmaker\\" spiralling all the way up to $106 milion in \\"The King of Torts\\" -- but the common thread is that fortune is illusory.  Another point is that, up through \\"The Chamber\\", Grisham's protagonists usually got happy endings -- he left a good portion of Southeastern lawyers swanning about the Caribbean -- but since then, most of his lawyers wind up with nothing.<br />Working within this narrow formula, \\"The King of Torts\\" is probably Grisham's most interesting legal thriller since \\"The Street Lawyer\\".  Clay Carter, a 31 year-old criminal defense attorney, spends the first 75 pages of the book toiling in anonymity in Washington D.C., and these pages are well done.  No sooner has Clay spurned a lucrative job offer and been dumped by his (very attractive) girlfriend than does a mysterious windfall appear, brought by a shady figure called \\"Max Pace\\".  For a while, Clay becomes uber-rich, running scam after scam for Pace and his unseen cronies.  But the pursuit of money inevitably leads to mayhem and intrigue in these books, so you know all the warning signs even before Clay's new world collapses around him (shortly after page 300 in the paperback, if you want to skip ahead to his downfall).<br />If you like the formula, you'll like this book better than most.  Clay's mistakes are more egregious than those of previous Grisham characters, and his fate is the dimmest of all.  This gives \\"The King of Torts\\" a little more unpredictability.<br />The most (or least) interesting twist to \\"The King of Torts\\" is returning character Patton French, who had a pointless extended cameo in \\"The Summons\\".  Here, French and his ilk (mass tort lawyers thriving off the federal class-actions system) take center stage.  Their scenes are played for comedy: gigantic private jets, luxurious yachts, beautiful women, enornmous amounts of money, etc.  A few lawyers are given depth, but you have to buy into the notion that the one-dimensional super-rich actually exist, before you can enjoy their scenes.  In the end, Grisham is not so much decrying their system, as he is the way they practice law: that is to say, without ever setting foot in the courtroom.<br />Come to think of it, it's now been years since Grisham wrote a novel that took place in the courtroom.  Maybe it's time he moved away from the piles of money, so he can get back to reality himself.	2003-12-29
US	51345392	R2BW4PEMXUHL6O	0426201493	837857790	Logopolis (Doctor Who)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	When Novelizations Mattered	I first read the novelization of \\"Logopolis\\" when I was in the sixth grade.  At that point, all I knew about \\"Doctor Who\\" was from the few 5th Doctor episodes I'd seen on PBS.  I borrowed the book from a classmate who was trying to explain how the 5th Doctor came to be.  Said classmate is now a life insurance agent in South Dakota and hasn't had any contact with \\"Doctor Who\\" in fifteen years.  The book he loaned me, however, remains one of my enduring favorites.<br />The novelizations of the \\"Doctor Who\\" TV adventures were an unusual breed: for many fans, they served as (at worst) a replacement for, or (at best) an improvement on the series itself.    The condensing of a TV script into 120 pages gave rise to a peculiar richness of language that laid the groundwork for a dozen years (and counting) of original \\"Doctor Who\\" novels.<br />Reading the back cover of the \\"Logopolis\\" novelization reveals a host of words you don't find any more in books aimed at 12 year-olds.  \\"Precipitated\\", for instace.  The opening paragraph of the story is unusually literate, presaging the Fourth Doctor's death: \\"Events cast shadows before them...\\".<br />The story's condensation is most keenly felt in author Bidmead's prose: a lot of on-screen dialogue is converted into plain text.  This keeps the narrative moving without turning the novelization into a mere transcript, but also preserves the richness of the original script.  In some instances, the story improves from the condensation: most of the shots of Tegan and Adric running up and down the TARDIS corridors have been omitted; instead, we're given a scene were Adric reads from \\"Paradise Lost\\".  The Doctor introduces Adric to the TARDIS's \\"logic circuits\\", a visually striking piece of equipment never seen on-screen.<br />Best of all is the restaging of the death scenes.  When the Monitor dies on-screen, it's done through a straight visual effect, and doesn't make all that much sense.  In the novelization, Bidmead makes the demise moregraphic, in a manner that couldn't have been realized on television.<br />The Doctor's death, too, is improved.  On TV, he climbs along a tilting catwalk on a telescope high above the ground, and is knocked over the edge by an explosion of sparks from a cable he's unplugged.  In the book, however, he falls from the catwalk first, and is left clinging to the cable for support.  By unplugging the cable he effectively commits suicide; this adds dramatic heft to his final choice and turns the Doctor into, if possible, an even more heroic figure than he was on TV.<br />Much of the relevance of the \\"Doctor Who\\" novelization has faded with time: video and DVD have made the stories more accessible than they were in the 1970s and '80s; the fan base has grown up  and no longer needs to read books that are 120 pages long.  _Logopolis_, however, in spite of a few instances of purple prose and some clunky similes, retains a poetry distinct from the TV story from which it was adapted, and thus still bears reading today.	2003-12-28
US	51345392	R1F7DNFDTRFO0X	0563538538	623524715	Ten Little Aliens (Doctor Who)	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Dark Progeny	All right, book, I don't like you, and you don't like me, but ...<br />This is just another outer-space action runaround.  It features a bunch of starship troopers from Earth colonies (inaptly named &quot;Toronto&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot;) in the unspecified future.  There's a very brief continuity link to &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;, just so we have a TV story cleary set in the same Nth Century as &quot;Ten Little Aliens&quot;.  Basically, a bunch of instantly forgettable Space Marines (nine humans and a stealth android a la &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;) traipse around an asteroid.  Many of them die, but until we find out who the killer is, the dead just don't stay dead.<br />There's a market for this kind of book, hopefully.  It's slow and dreary and it's impossible for any of character to generate emotional traction with the audience.  In books past, Steve Cole adopted the baffling policy of naming his characters after nouns.  In &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; his main character was a detective named Dark; in &quot;Parallel 59&quot;, there was a guy named Dam, who burst.  Here, we have not just Shade, but Haunt as well.  The guy named Roba is clearly named after the two annoying aliens from &quot;The Dominators&quot; (Rago and Toba).  There is at least the neat visual trick of introducing all the characters in a chapter with a grey background and numerous fonts, which of course makes it easier to remember who's who.  The guy named Creben is the most interesting character in the intro, as he's clearly more enlightened regarding the alien menace than his shipmates.  That's why it's a major surprise that he's not the first character killed!  Unfortunately, he's never interesting again, and that's indicative of the overall malaise surrounding the secondary cast.<br />However, just because the book is dull doesn't mean it lacks merit.  It gives us a Doctor/companion pairing never before seen in the books: the First Doctor, Ben and Polly.  The Doctor, as in &quot;The Man in the Velvet Mask&quot;, is dying of old age, and that's the character trait Cole runs with.  There are a couple of startling bursts of insight, most notably when Polly peers into the Doctor's mind (with a bit of Nth-century technology) and finds a marvelous bit of prose.  Though the Doctor's body is aging graphically, his mind remains useful.<br />The only time Cole gets the Doctor *wrong* is the climax.  In his final speech, Hartnell lectures one of the surviving Earth marines who hasn't learned that diplomacy, not scorched-earth retaliation, is a better solution to war.  This, four pages after Hartnell orders the vicious death of one of the terrorists.  Cole's message is timely; his delivery, however, is throw-the-book-across-the-room dreadful.<br />What's done with Ben and Polly is interesting.  Those companions were fresh, not only because were they played by two very appealing young actors, but because they were so very 1966 -- going to nightclubs, speaking in the vernacular of the era.  It's still fun to watch Ben and Polly work their way through their debut story, &quot;The War Machines&quot;.  Here, Ben is clearly a part of what we now believe 1966 was like (the author was born at least four years later).  Ben is casually racist towards the one crewmember of Chinese descent; however, Polly calls him on it, and Ben backs down, a little.  But Polly also runs around in a day-glo yellow spacesuit, and Ben, out of his depth with the taller, stronger soldiers of the Nth Century, gets to survive intact and prove his worth a few times over.  This is not the definitive Ben/Polly book (I don't think there can ever be one, since there's so little background to work with) but it's not a bad way to lead you back to their TV episodes.<br />There are good passages in &quot;Ten Little Aliens&quot;, if you read your way through the whole thing.  The graphic body horror actually puts it in the tradition of &quot;The Tenth Planet&quot; and &quot;TheFaceless Ones&quot;, although obviously the gore is ramped up 10,000 times, to match the books' baseline splatter content.  However, it's mostly without charm and, apart from new looks at the TV regulars, doesn't have a whole lot else to distinguish it from other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; books.	2003-12-23
US	51345392	R1FVLM65YOZSKK	056353852X	315070072	Warmonger (Doctor Who)	Books	3	9	13	N	N	A letter to my 7th grade English teacher	Dear Mrs. Arnold,<br />I graduated in your class since 1986, but I still haven't figured out what you had against me.  Your bizarre system of seating the class alphabetically meant that I had to sit in the very back of the room, even though I was shorter than the four kids in front of me, and even though I had glasses and they didn't.  I also don't understand why you gave me low grades on my book reports.  It's one thing if you didn't want me reading \\"The Andromeda Strain\\", but you didn't have to go and give me a C+, either.  I still maintain that I tried real hard on that one.<br />What I want to say now is that I've just finished \\"Warmonger\\", by Terrance Dicks.  When I was in your class, most of the books I read were by Terrance Dicks, although I wasn't allowed to do book reports on \\"Doctor Who\\" novelizations since they weren't real books.  So now I want to write a review of Warmonger for you.  I know you didn't encourage essays... you wanted us to write capsules, in which we described the book's conflict, its major characters, its setting.  You only wanted a four-sentence plot summary and you punished me when I couldn't describe \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" in that short a space.  But here goes... even though \\"Warmonger\\" is a huge novel, it's very simple and not very sophisticated.<br />The book opens with a literary flashback, which you might have appreciated.  We're taken right back to Gallifrey, to watch a younger version of our old friend Cardinal Borusa, depose an unnamed President who will come back to be important later.  Then, we're jumped right to the present, but it's very disconcerting.  Peri, the Doctor's sweet young American companion, is suddenly an embittered guerilla fighter on a one-dimensional planet of farmers and outdoor cafes.  All her fellow rebels are killed off in Chapter 1.  Then Peri kills an evil soldier, and gets kidnapped herself by an all-powerful warlord called \\"The Supremo\\"... who turns out to be.. the 5th Doctor!<br />The rest of the book jumps back in time one year to show how Peri and the Doctor became so unrecognizable.  I guess you could say the conflict in \\"Warmonger\\" is \\"person versus self\\".  The Doctor fights against his nature to become the unwilling leader of an army of thousands!  Draconians... Ogrons... Sontarans... every villain created during Terrance Dicks' turn as script editor on \\"Doctor Who\\" returns as friends here.  Even the Cybermen show up as allies (\\"That battle was excellent!\\", says the Cyberleader).  Also, every character for whom Terrance Dicks ever wrote dialogue, is brought back in \\"Warmonger\\" for a cameo.  You want me to list the book's major characters for my book report?  It would take too long, too long.  Mother Maren.  Ohica.  Solon.  Borusa.  Morbius.  And then there are the original characters -- Hawken, Delmar, Vidal.  Good heavens, there's even a General Nadir!  He sure is, Mrs. Arnold.  He sure is.<br />There are lot of big moments in \\"Warmonger\\".  There are epic battles, clever strategems, lots of politics.  However, it all goes by so fast, so unconvincing.  The climactic battle on Karn is resolved in two sentences.  When Morbius is finally captured, the Doctor then has to turn against his allies and fight on Morbius's side, just so Solon can steal his brain and skulk off into the sequel story \\"The Brain of Morbius\\", which Dicks already wrote in 1976.  There are lots of \\"adult\\" themes, too... Peri is threatened with sexual assault every three pages.  Literally!  Except for when she's trying to seduce the Doctor, because she's suddenly turned on by his Supremo self with the military brush-cut.<br />For all these set pieces, though, I was just never convinced that this is how things really were.  In 1986, I spent most of my time in your class waiting for the TARDIS to materialize so Doctor Who could take me away.  I wanted to travel with the Fifth Doctor and be in stories like \\"The Visitation\\", and \\"The Awakening\\", and \\"The King's Demons\\".  If I had known this was in store, I would have daydreamed instead about Elisabeth Shue.<br />\\"Doctor Who\\" was never this cartoonish when Terrance Dicks wrote for it on TV.  \\"The War Games\\" and \\"Horror of Fang Rock\\" were very literate scripts, which still hold up today.  Even \\"The Brain of Morbius\\" sails through on charm, even though it's not very good.  But in order to write the prequel to \\"Morbius\\", Dicks is just going through the motions.  His action spans a whole year, and dozens of planets, but there's never a moment of true reflection.  If I had tried to write Morbius fanfic when I was twelve, I think the Morbius I invented would have had more weight and life than this.<br />Mrs. Arnold, I'm not 12 anymore.  I don't think you were successful in getting me to love literature.  You taught me that books were to be dissected, not enjoyed.  You taught me that notebooks were to be inspected for note-taking quality; how could I hear your lessons if I was busy taking notes?  The only real moment of kindness you showed me the whole year was when you gave me a pencil with the name \\"Demosthenes\\" on it.  I can't figure that out.  I've anagrammed that name a hundred times since 1986 -- a thousand! -- and it still doesn't resolve itself into the name of a Terrance Dicks villain.	2003-12-15
US	51345392	RD7OOGCVLHASV	0563538503	519117059	Amorality Tale (Doctor Who)	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Woke Up This Morning	It's not a very good book, but &quot;Amorality Tale&quot; is actually one of the rare Past Doctor novels that would translate well to television.  Set in December 1952, when the East End of London was choked by a killer smog that took 10,000 lives, David Bishop's tale is populated with gangsters and a man of God.  Some creative casting turns the book into that science-fiction episode of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; that never got written, and all of a sudden this annoying little novel becomes a winner.<br />Think about it.  Tommy Ramsey (it's spelled as &quot;Ramsay&quot; too) is the head gangster in the run-down East End -- which, in United States terms, is clearly the New Jersey, to central London's New York -- so he's obviously Tony Soprano.  Cast him as James Gandolfini and you've got a deal.  Meanwhile, his gang is being eyed lustily from the outside by a big-time gangster named McManus (or, depending on the page, MacManus) who does side deals with Ramsey's lieutenants and wears a camel-haired coat.  That's Johnny Sack, played on TV by Vincent Curatola.  Ramsey's bodyguard is named &quot;Brick&quot;, the big guy with the sensitive heart.  That's Big P, of course, so get Vincent Pastore on the phone.  Bob Valentine, the drunken detective on the Ramsey payroll... well, he's either John Heard's detective from Season 1 of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, or the Bobby Valentine who used to manage the New York Mets.  Meanwhile, Ramsey's doting mom may actually try to kill him.  Sound familiar?  The rest of Ramsey's mob is pretty faceless, but if you randomly read their dialogue with the voices of Tony Sirico and Joe Pantoliano, it's palatable.<br />Why go through this elaborate casting exercise?  Well, to avoid the pain of all the downbeat badly-written death.  We learn from the very beginning that the body count will reach five figures, so we learn not to get too attached to the many one-dimensional secondary characters we meet.  But there is a neat trick to figure out just when they'll die.  These cardboards are lovingly introduced with just a name (sometimes a first and a last name, even), and a comedic physical description.  But that's all we learn... until the character's entire backstory is dumped on us in a three-paragraph splunge.  When you see that splunge.. duck!  Someone is about to die horribly!  It's the summer blockbuster tactic of not naming a supporting character... until the moment before his death, when his name is used four times.<br />Amorality Tale does well with its prose for about 100 pages.  The Doctor and Sarah infiltrate themselves into the East End and watch Ramsey square off against an upstart kid named Callum.  We know Callum doesn't belong, because he has pale skin and black eyes.  We also know that the man of God, Xavier, doesn't belong -- he's a Catholic priest but his liturgy is entirely Pentecostal (on &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, the Catholic priest was played by Paul Schulze, who also plays a good guy/bad guy on &quot;24&quot;, so he fits in this cast too).  Oh, and there's clearly something odd about the Bread of Life he's trying to sell.  So those are the two mysteries.  But on page 100, Callum's secret is revealed, and the novel falls apart with an annoying screech right there.<br />We're introduced to the inevitable alien race, given only a vague description as &quot;creatures of light and darkness&quot;.  What does that mean?  Actulaly, they're also said to have &quot;a hundred eyes&quot;.  Yes, but there's a song that says the night has a thousand eyes!  And a thousand eyes can't help but see.  Top that one, will you?<BR>The Pertwee years were characterized not by monsters, but by developed alien races.  The Silurians, the Peladons, the Draconians... these were literate creatures, with a purpose.  Event those aliens that wanted to conquer Earth -- Nestenes, Axons -- were given a twist (the Nestenes could manipulate plastic, and Axos came in friendship).  The Xhinn, however, just want to grind up thehumans into paste.  Their &quot;twist&quot; is that they come in groups of three, and speak for pages at a time in single-sentence paragraphs.  Boy, doesn't this eat up the word count 'til the cows come home.<br />By the book's final day, just about everyone is dead.  I think only four named characters survive.  There's an attempt at Pertwee-style morality when the villains are dispatched, or when Ramsey continues to kill after earning the Doctor's trust.  Nothing ground-breaking.  Finally, in the epilogue, a long-dead character comes back to life.  O-kay.  Thanks for playing.  Time to store my copy of &quot;Amorality Tale&quot; in a bowling bag and spend a long weekend in the Pine Barrens with a Czechoslovakian interior decorator.	2003-12-08
US	51345392	RD6JJFQSZ3ECN	0426204042	452447912	The Left-Handed Hummingbird (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	It Hums	And a happy Tenth Anniversary to &quot;The Left-Handed Hummingbird&quot;, which was released a decade ago this month and made a big splash on the Internet.  Rightfully so.<br />I picked up &quot;Hummer&quot; again for the first time in years and years, after a recent viewing of &quot;The Aztecs&quot; -- a 1964 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; adventure which is partly the inspiration for Kate Orman's debut novel.  Indeed, the parts of &quot;Hummer&quot; which return the 7th Doctor (and Ace) to 15th century Mexico display a marvelous combination of action and historical detail.  The segment begins with the Doctor attracting attention to himself by juggling in the marketplace... and ends with a barrage of corpses.  While &quot;The Aztecs&quot; is a prime representative example of early &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (and has a relatively low body count), &quot;Hummer&quot; was &quot;Doctor Who' at its best 30 years later, and the high body count is suited to the novels of its day.<br />At the outset of her professional writing career, Orman established a rhythmic routine, introducing with both the Doctor and the villain (Huitzilin, the living Aztec god of war) in the very first scene.  After a series of dramatic psychic attacks, the story steps back for some well-written exposition.  This alternating pace escalates over the rest of the novel.  After the Aztecs are left behind, the TARDIS travels to hippie London in late 1968, an overly-dirty New York City in December 1980, and finally, to the last hours of the Titanic.<br />Also pioneered here in the books is the old-time fanfic concept of &quot;hurt/comfort&quot;, in which the lead character is alternately brutalized and cuddled.  Here, Ace, by turns, stabs the Doctor in the chest, and gives him a back massage.  I can't say this technique was well-used -- it would be taken to rather silly extremes a few books down the road -- but it works in its initial outing.<br />Another welcome feature in the prose is the author's own personal interests -- making this a rare example of a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story that actually inhabits its 1993 setting.  Characters watch reruns of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; -- in Spanish.  There's more use of the Beatles than &quot;Doctor Who&quot; had seen before, or would see since.  There's a strong gun-control argument made throughout, including a pointed barb at Ronald Reagan.  There are continuity references to other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV stories (&quot;Death to the Daleks&quot;, &quot;The Pirate Planet&quot;) which aren't integral to understanding the book, but provide an extra frisson if you remember them.<br />And then there is, of course, the research.  In another neat narrative trick, the Doctor and Ace's journey to Mexico is intercut with scenes of the Doctor's other companion, Professor Summerfield, sitting in a library researching Aztec culture.  The library segments actually increase the tension in the companion historical scenes.  This is not an easy trick to pull off.  Similarly, the Titanic sequence is intercut with authentic scenes set in the Titanic's telegraph room.  The Doctor carries on board with him a typed list of the names of those who survived the disaster -- a wonderfully human touch.<br />&quot;The Left-Handed Hummingbird&quot;, with all of the above, is a comparatively short 264 pages.  There's horrific violence and great small moments of humanity.  The only &quot;dip&quot; in the book's comes after the first 100 pages, with the introduction of a Dooctor-hating UNIT lieutenant, interruping the frenetic Aztec segment and leading into the slightly less interesting London sequence.<br />However, this is a book told with real passion for the historical and the temporal.  In spite of the body count, it's got a boatload (sorry) of images to remember.  Feathers growing out of the possessed Doctor's hair.  The child's doll that improbably survived the Titanic's sinking.  And the stunningly well-placed quote from &quot;Hotel California&quot;.	2003-12-05

Whatever.<br />Chris Bulis has now written, by his own count, one million words of \\"Doctor Who\\"-associated fiction.  Whatever.<br />\\"Palace of the Red Sun\\" is the third of those novels (that's 25%, that is) with Peri as the companion.  Whatever.<br />\\"Palace of the Red Sun\\" features three seemingly random plots.  One takes place on a weird world populated by one-dimensional fairy-tale characters, stuck in a sixth-grade-reader version of Camelot, with princesses and dukes and bawdy Shakespearian nurses.  Whatever.<br />The second plot features a bunch of futuristic stereotypes (the benign-ish military conqueror, the unscrupulous journalist) with more Silly Space Names than a Terrance Dicks novel.  Names like \\"Glavis Judd\\" (love can build a bridge) and \\"Dexel Dynes\\" (back to the lab again, Dexter).  Then again, Chris Bulis is the man who once gave us Gelbert J. Sternby.  Whatever.<br />The third plot is about the generic Doctor, with a generic female companion in various states of deshabille -- who spends a lot of time fantasizing about getting into the bathtub.  The only thing that distinguishes Bulis's 6th Doctor from, well, any of the other seven Doctors he's inked, is the sardonic punishment inflicted on the bad guys at the end.  Whatever.<br />There's an obvious plot twist telegraphed 200 pages in advance, and it's clear from the very beginning just what these characters are hiding.  Whatever.<br />And yet, when the plot twist comes, on page 225 of course, it's carried off with such brash Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland enthusiasm, that you can't help but be carried along with it all.  Let's write a \\"Doctor Who\\" novel right here! In this barn!  With just us kids!  Whatever.<br />In the end, the book comes and goes.  Dexel Dynes could come back in another Bulis novel in four years and I won't remember whatbook he's from next time, either.  Whatever.<br />It's impossible to hate a Bulis novel, although it's impossible to want to reread them again, either.  He's more Bob Baker and Dave Martin than Robert Holmes.  Whatever.<br />In a million words of \\"Doctor Who\\"-associated fiction, Bulis has never once taken a risk, or told us something we don't know.  And yes, he never leaves you feeling cheated.  Whatever.<br />He'll be back again next year, with the Nth Doctor and Companion X.  I'll buy that book, too.<br />Whatever.	2003-11-30

You got your multiple doctors, check.  Montage of scenes from &quot;The Mind of Evil&quot;, &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot;, and &quot;The Creature From the Pit&quot; (!), check.  Obscure continuity references, check: members of an alien race referred to in passing in &quot;Time-Flight&quot;, and lyrics from a song once recorded by Jon Pertwee.<br />So.  What's &quot;Cold Fusion&quot; about?<br />Buried deep in an interview on the BBC Doctor Who Books website, Lance Parkin reveals that the germ of &quot;Cold Fusion&quot; was the war in Yugoslavia.  At its heart this was a book about the Fifth Doctor (&quot;Bland&quot;) fighting in a local war... and opposed by the Seventh Doctor (the &quot;Dark&quot; one) masterminding the other side.  Great idea!  However, it doesn't really play out here.  &quot;Cold Fusion&quot; is consumed by flashbacks, by references to past and future Gallifreyan history, and by any number of &quot;Oh!  Look how clever&quot; moments.  The novel is consequently much darker than the dark comedy left on the drawing board.<br />&quot;Cold Fusion&quot; had me scratching my head.  The book is seven years old, and subsequent developments in the book lines rendered its revelations moot.  I searched the Internet in search for other commentary about just what it all means, but apart from the brief interview with Lance, couldn't find any.<br />This is the plot, all spoilers: The Fifth Doctor, before the death of Adric, lands on a 30th century Earth colony, where the scientific ruling elite is threatened by terrorists, and undermined by the descendants of UNIT.  Lost beneath the snow is a TARDIS from ancient Gallifrey.  The pilot -- Patience -- is still alive, and regenerates.  We learn she's the wife of the Other -- one of the creators of Gallifrey who vanished into history to enter the Doctor's own timeline.  Meanwhile, the journey of Patience's TARDIS unleashes the Ferutu -- Time Lords from the end of an alternateUniverse.  In order to save the web of time, the Doctor must send the proto-TARDIS home to ancient Gallifrey.  However, the Seventh Doctor, shortly before the death of Roz, outwits his earlier self, and uses the proto-TARDIS instead to destroy the Ferutu and their universe.  Most of the colony is wrecked, and Patience is killed by UNIT.  Roz knocks the Fifth Doctor unconscious so the Seventh Doctor can make his getaway.<br />Deep, deep stuff.  Any one of the three stories here is interesting, but not all together.  The colony story sort of just fades away, both sides thugs, Lance's pointed political asides disappearing into the ether.  I came away with a loathing for the Seventh Doctor... who really wasn't about the things he did in this novel.  The Ferutu remain inscrutable, not tragic.<br />The black, black comedy intrudes.  There are two very funny moments of 30th century hijinks: the Doctor disarms a &quot;war-droid&quot;, which rattles out a string of hilarious operating instructions.  Later, we learn that robot labor speaks in working-class accents and govern themselves with dilatory union tactics.  Both these moments are laugh-out-loud funny.  They're also followed by brutal deaths just paragraphs later.  Maybe that sums up &quot;Cold Fusion&quot; in a nutshell.  It's got these great ideas, but just doesn't know where to put 'em.<br />&quot;Cold Fusion&quot; is sad, sad, sad.  There's a lot of death -- maybe the highest body-count ever in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, apart from what was implied in &quot;Logopolis&quot;.  But the end of the Universe in &quot;Logopolis&quot; was balanced by themes of rebirth.  &quot;Cold Fusion&quot; is ambitious, and weighs on the mind when it's all over.  However, as dark as it is, what does it all mean?  What's it all for?	2003-11-26
US	51345392	R2O6LUDZXD8NKE	0563538430	105310686	Drift (Doctor Who)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Gorier than Ezra Jack Keats	It's hard to rate &quot;Drift&quot;.  It's a debut novel, nominally a 4th Doctor and Leela book, the second in four for the PDAs (coming behind &quot;Psi-ence Fiction&quot;).  Leela is very much a minimal presence, which I think is probably a good thing, especially coming so soon after a book by the guy who created her.<br />What's most noteworthy, I think, is that &quot;Drift&quot; is set entirely in the United States (southern New Hampshire)... and actually feels like it's filmed in the US, as opposed to TC4!  Let's face it, most &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels set in the States miss the mark in terms of what characters would think and say.  When Forward describes a stretch of I-93 in New Hampshire, though, you can actually believe he's driven it (as I have).  The character names are more diverse than in &quot;Salvation&quot; -- although when a guy named Marotta shows up here, as sure as eggs is eggs, the word &quot;Brooklyn&quot; is close behind -- so there's finally a sense that not ALL Americans in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;have Anglo names and speak with stilted southern accents.  On the other hand, the token New England general store clerk doesn't say &quot;Ayuh&quot; once, so maybe Forward doesn't know his cliches all that well.<br />I enjoyed the sense of menace that gradually builds up over the first 175 pages or so, and unleashes over a prolonged, violent, action-filled climax.  80% of the word count is devoted to descriptions of snow which, let's be honest, grate after a while, especially when the author has to resort to phrases like &quot;cold inferno&quot; on page 217.  Before the action takes over, we meet several characters, military and civilian alike.  The military leader is not a closed-minded buffoon, and even the drunken ex-husband gets a few moments of pathos before the inevitable happens.<br />The plot is hard to make out if you're reading too quickly.  The details involve an extraterrestrial device of unspecified origin; a couple of incognito aliens (again, unspecified) looking for a way home; and psi-conscious cultists looking to cross over.  Most of this information is kept in the margins -- perhaps too far in, especially in the case of the cultists, who are massacred offscreen practically before page one, and the survivors of whom streak across the first 4/5ths of the novel committing random violent acts for reasons we're never fully made aware.<br />Even if rookie author Forward gets a little carried away with choice of language and stylistic techniques -- clarity and simplicity really are virtues, even though the BBC editors don't seem to encourage them -- there's also solid plotting, good characterization, and well-visualized action on display.  And, lest you think Forward is taking this too seriously, the day is saved because the hero gets drunk.  The palette is small (one New Hampshire village) but well-defined.  Honestly, I enjoyed this far more than Stephen King's comparable &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;, which distended over 900 pages and was a lot more gross.<br />One thing that jarred is the sudden intrusion of body horror at the tail, tail end of the novel.  Most of the early deaths are suggested at, not shown, or least played as CGI effects rathern than gore.  In the last chapter, however, one character dies when icicles spike through their eyeballs.  This jars, and I can only assume it was the fault of A) an editor who failed to take it out, or B) an editor who insisted, &quot;Hey, this is a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel with psi-powers, so we have to trot out the same anime-style deaths that the New Adventures ran into the ground during their psi-powers arc!&quot;.<br />Otherwise, Forward manages to rise above more recent DW cliches, by leaving most of his regular cast alive, and reasonably happy, at the end of the day.  All together this is one of the more enjoyable debut novels of 2002 and stacks up well with the fandom-acclaimed (and doubly oblique) &quot;History 101&quot;.	2003-11-18
US	51345392	R250T2EO4TATGM	0563538449	776280835	Relative Dementias (Doctor Who)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	The Missing New Adventure	Now that the Past Doctor Adventures no longer feature that little back cover blurb telling you in between which televised &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories the book took place, it's fun to play that game at home.  &quot;Relative Dementias&quot;, a rookie effort by Mark Michalowski, is almost definitely set during the TV show's 26th and final season -- witness a reference to that season's premiere, &quot;Battlefield&quot;, and the Doctor wearing the dark-brown coat he sported only in that season.  Ace fails to recognize alien technology she'll later meet in a novel set during the putative &quot;Season 27&quot; (the linked PDAs written by Mike Tucker and Robert Perry).  So, most likely, &quot;Relative Dementias&quot; takes place before the New Adventures happened.<br />However, this book IS a New Adventure.  In tone and texture and content, it's as close as we've seen to an NA since that series lost its &quot;Doctor Who&quot; license early in 1997.<br />And yes, by being an NA, &quot;Relative Dementias&quot; is far better than many of the PDAs (or EDAs) that came before it.<br />Although the majority of the book is set in Scotland in 1982 (a year characterized solely by references to the Falkland Islands... with one &quot;Star Wars&quot; in-joke that could also have worked in 2002), there's an intro sequence and a coda set in the London of 2012.  Overlaying the book is a moderately nifty time paradox involving this other time zone.<br />&quot;Relative Dementias&quot; also touches on deeply personal issues, apart from the science fiction.  The novel's early thrust is Alzheimer's Disease -- much of the book takes place in a home for Alzheimer's patients.  Another character is revealed, late in the book, to have a rare genetic disorder.  The book's &quot;main&quot; character, a UNIT scientist named Joyce Brunner (like the NAs, this book partly shifts focus off the Doctor in favor of an original character), is introduced as an old friend having family issues of her own -- involving not just her aging mother, but also her rebellious son -- a UNIT cadet.<br />So, here's a book that begins nicely, and ends nicely.  In between, there's the author's-first-novel sin of.. well, just too much running around.  A chase around the Alzheimer's home, a dash through the woods, a detour to a deserted island (seemingly inexplicable until you get to the end), and, hey!, since this is &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, a fight in a seemingly abandoned church.<br />The other sin is the conflict.  Joyce's son is mad at the Doctor; Ace gets mad at the Doctor.  You get the picture.  I'm not sure why, though.  The Doctor's final gambit is rather clever (and laugh-out-loud funny).  Ace's negative reaction, however, sours the book, and I'm not quite sure I sympathize with her.  Then again, gratuitous Ace angst was par for the course in the NAs, so you'd expect to find the problem here too.  Even though there's a happy ending, and a party over the last 15 pages (a technique well pioneered in the NAs by Paul Cornell), there's a foreboding cliffhanger, of sorts, involving a frightening new memory plaguing the Doctor.<br />On the whole, if you want to remember what compelling &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction used to look like, &quot;Relative Dementias&quot; (while certainly not on the level of &quot;Festival of Death&quot;) is a good place to start.  It's also the best 7th Doctor PDA I've read to this point.	2003-11-13

Especially if your expectations have been dulled by, say, \\"Divided Loyalties\\" or \\"Invasion of the Cat-People\\", you might be happy to find that not all that much in this book is risible.<br />On the other hand, I can't think of too many things I liked about it, either.  I don't know what I would say, for example, if I were asked to recommend it to others.  I'm not a 6th Doctor fan by any means -- not on TV, not in print -- so this less over-the-top print version of the Colin Baker Doctor does not get me excited.  I liked Mel as a companion, but this book's contribution to the post-TV companion canon -- Dr. Evelyn Smythe from the Big Finish audios -- was a letdown.<br />Evelyn takes up large portions of the text, without really adding much.  She's introduced as a character not through her actions, but by long-winded speeches -- by speeches by the Doctor; by her duelling monologues with Mel (I hesitate to call them \\"conversations\\"); and, worst of all, through her own speeches.  We keep hearing about how great she is.  Fine.  Go out and prove it.  Do something heroic.  Be less annoying.<br />When \\"Instruments of Darkness\\" isn't about Evelyn, or about Evelyn's relationship with the Doctor (she's introduced as a jilted former companion), or about what Mel thinks of Evelyn... there's a convoluted plot about alien beings (think Trelayne, if the Squire of Gothos had a less self-aware younger brother) perverting the course of human history.  There are telepaths in France and Auton telepaths in England.  There are a couple of well-drawn American reporters, but they're limited to about 12 pages of text (set in Micronesia, would you believe) and could be eliminated from the story without a hiccup.  The end of the book is meant to be tragic, but it ends with the self-sacrifice of a zero-dimensional quaternary character, so... if you can figure it out, you can enjoy it.  At least you'll be able to say, \\"I never saw that one coming!\\", and mean it.<br />\\"Instruments of Darkness\\" takes 70 Doctor-free pages to get going.  The first original \\"Doctor Who\\" novels published in the early 1990s did well with this approach.  Here, however, the space is used to introduce about 20 characters in short, violent, action/tragedy sequences.  Coming at the end of the novel, such a montage could have provided kick.  Coming at the beginning, however, it's a drag.  Who are these people?  Why do they then vanish for the next 150 pages?<br />So, let's recap.  I've complained about the plot, I've complained about the characters.  Now, let me switch gears and kvell about the villain.  Remember that annoying habit the New Adventures had, of bringing back old TV companions, ruining their lives, turning them against the Doctor, and killing them off?  Well, one of the human villains of this piece is a familiar figure.  Not from the TV show, but, for once, it's a pleasure to bring back someone else just to ruin their lives.  That's why I give the book extra points and that's why I owe Gary Russell a beer.	2003-11-11
US	51345392	R2GQYAPWYE8T68	0563538406	542655598	Dying in the Sun (Doctor Who)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Dianetics in the Sun	There's a great wicked Hollywood-cult-frenzy parody waiting to get out of &quot;Dying in the Sun&quot;.  The underlying notion is that a bunch of possibly-benevolent glowing particles attach themselves to the celluloid print of a ludicrously awful Hollywood &quot;B&quot; film in 1947, in an attempt to take over the world.  Funny concept.  However, first-time &quot;Doctor Who&quot; author Jon DeBurgh Miller (who previously cut his teeth in a DW-spinoff range) also takes a somber look at the notion of &quot;celebrity&quot;.  Not only can his Selyoid (ha ha) creatures attach themselves to reels of film, but they can also meld with B-list actors (with evocatively phony names like &quot;Caleb Rochefort&quot;) and turn those poor schlubs into international icons.<br />The novel kicks into gear about halfway through, when the Second Doctor and Ben are invited to the &quot;Dying in the Sun&quot; launch party, and meet a group of robed cultists who're using the Selyoids to further their aims of world domination by the power of rational thinking.  Curiously, there are no blatant L. Ron Hubbard jokes, although we do get the token gag about the Jewish screenwriter who offers to change his religion, if it'll help him sell his scripts.  That's about as topical as &quot;Dying in the Sun&quot; gets.<br />Oh wait -- there's also one very anti-Communist LAPD captain, a villainous part based probably on a bunch of film noir roles, and almost certainly in part on John Mahon's character from &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (and &quot;Angel&quot; Season 1, for that matter).  But that's the B-plot, and it seems to be there for atmosphere, mostly.<br />Miller's novel is easy to read, easy to forget.  His choice of TARDIS crew is handled adequately.  The Doctor could easily be Patrick Troughton's Doctor.  Most of the scenes are told from Ben's perspective, although he remains defined by his accent more than by his choices.  Indeed most of the action scenes seem flat, perfunctory -- the flashback to director De Sande's discovery of the Selyoids, which could have been a grandly creepy moment, is rushed through, and that's a representative sample of the rest of the adventure.  There's an issue of demonic possession, as one of the regulars is absorbed by the Selyoids... but then promptly vanishes from the story.<br />The novel only really falls apart in the final 20 pages.  The showdown between the head Selyoid honcho and the surprise bad guy turns into... a drinking contest.  Later, one of the regulars casually commits double murder by causing an airplane to explode (by bombarding it with skyscraper-sized projections from &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;).  Still, the ending is not enough to sour the warm, bland taste of the rest of the novel.<br />Unlike the recent release of another late-'40s Hollywood film just out on DVD -- &quot;Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; -- this is not an offering you'll watch again and again, but it's OK the one time.	2003-10-30
US	51345392	R173AE34MIRTBI	0563538147	927083200	Psi-Ence Fiction (Doctor Who)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Let's scream again, like we did last summer	I just watched a montage of some of the cheez-iest moments in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; history, in a special &quot;40th Anniversary&quot; montage on the new DVD release of &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;.  This is the way &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was meant to be seen -- rapid-fire clips of men in rubber masks; BBC-repertory actors gesticulating wildly; random shots of the Doctor pumping his fists; cheap special effects and wobbly models.  The last chapter of &quot;Psi-ence Fiction&quot;, if filmed, would look an awful lot like something out of this montage.  There are strobe lights, shouting villains, and Tom Baker yelling out characters' surnames.<br />The rest of &quot;Psi-ence Fiction&quot; is clearly meant to be contemporary, not retro.  Author Chris Boucher, who wrote three scripts for &quot;Who&quot; back in the seventies, populates his English university with lots of modern-day pop culture references: &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Kevin Williamson-style horror movies, and the Doctor reflecting nostalgically on the works of Charles M. Schulz.  But I could never decide if Boucher was writing this story on a modern day, Russell T. Davies-sized budget... or for that old, studio-bound, Seventies &quot;Who&quot; feel.<br />The best parts of &quot;Psi-ence Fiction&quot; involve Leela and the Doctor.  One of the great things about &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, that has sustained it for forty years of ongoing adventure, is that the adventure is never really done.  Louise Jameson the actress quit the TV show in 1978, but here's Boucher in 2001 still generating new insights into Leela the character.  The Fourth Doctor, likewise, still has a zany head to be explored, and Boucher has fun parroting his thought processes.<br />The story itself is a bit thin, and the cast is small.  Oddly, the lack of death in this story takes some edge off the horror sequences: no-one ever dies on-screen.  The order of the day instead is witty banter: five college kids insult each other with winksand nods; a couple of policemen tease each other in a way that Briscoe and Logan would never have tolerated.<br />It's all fun in small doses, but there's that budget factor again: this all would have played badly in the Seventies, with hammy actors interpreting the scripts.  It would look flashy today on a Hollywood budget, but every time I was ready to picture Gwyneth Paltrow as Chloe, the nominal female protagonist (who's described as a &quot;leggy blonde&quot; and who's fetchingly nude for pages at a time), she kept devolving into Elisha Cuthbert.  Maybe watching all that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has rendered my theater-of-the-mind incapable of thinking big.	2003-10-26

Nine consecutive losses in games that could have clinched the American League Division Series?  Did you watch last night's Game 5 of the 2003 ALDS, Oakland against the Boston Red Sox?  It was a remarkable bit of baseball.  Even skipping all the baserunning errors and pitching changes, Oakland only trailed 4-3 in the bottom of the 9th, with Boston's highly suspect bullpen poised to give the game to Oakland.<br />This is how the inning unfolded for Oakland: Walk.  Walk.  Sacrifice bunt.  Called strike three.  Walk.  Called strike three.<br />No runs.  No hits.  No swings.  No errors.  Three men left on.  Red Sox 4, A's 3.<br />The legacy of Billy Beane is a story that's not yet fully written.  There are now three AL teams that play Moneyball -- Boston and Toronto as well as Oakland.  Two of those are playoff teams, and Toronto is on the march, perpetually improving third-place finishers in a strong division.  The story of &quot;Moneyball&quot;, as told by Michael Lewis, effortlessly recounts the &quot;stathead&quot; revolution: how analysis of baseball stats went from the only three stats shown on TV in the '70s (BA, HR, RBI), to the more complex methods espoused by Harvard men like Paul DePodesta, who came to power at the height of the small-market revolution.  Unbeknownst to baseball's asleep-at-the-wheel Commissioner, there is a way to win ball games without expensive free agent signings.  Billy Beane's A's have won four straight AL West titles, espousing the virtues of patience, power, pitchers who throw strikes.  Under his philosophy, teams can win with or without the high-salaried slugger (Jason Giambi, who crawled his way to a .250 batting average with the Yanks in 2003), without the highly-paid manager (Art Howe, who sleepwalked his way to a last-place finish with the Mets in '03, and hopefully won't be back).  Oakland wins every year, even as their salary plummets.  They'll lose Miguel Tejada this winter, and stillwin at least 95 games in 2004.  This is baseball... without the baseball. <br />Where are the limits to winning Moneyball?  You go deep into the A's lineup in the bottom of the 9th in the One Big Game they couldn't win:  where was the slugger?  Where was the scary bat?  For a team that prides itself on the big picture (the three-run homer), where were the fundamentals?  Why didn't Eric Byrnes touch home in Game 3?  Why did two different innings in Game 5 end when baserunners were gunned down (by a mile each) going for the extra base?  Why did Ramon Hernandez sac-bunt in the 9th, giving the Red Sox pitchers the out they couldn't get themselves?  Why didn't Melhuse and Long *swing* at strike three?<br />In the long run, Moneyball has proven itself to be a winning philosophy.  The sabermetrics revolution is in its early stages, not its late stages -- in spite of Oakland's repeated playoff failures; in spite of Anaheim's throwback World Series win in 2002; in spite of George Steinbrenner's bank vault and cable millions.  This is the wave of the future, the natural answer to baseball's escalating salary structure:  you can win without paying $6 million a year to a .260 hitter who doesn't walk, or without paying Todd van Poppel money to Todd Van Poppel.<br />However... why are the A's 0-9 in championship games?<br />Why didn't the team take their bats off their shoulders when it really counted?	2003-10-07
US	51345392	R308CH0PGH9UB6	0743243803	273355303	The Partly Cloudy Patriot	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Partly Sunny	I first came to Sarah Vowell not through NPR, but rather through an essay she wrote about Mel Gibson's &quot;The Patriot&quot;, for a now-defunct webzine called Open Letters.  Some months later she wrote a fascinating Election Day rumination on David Letterman and American voting habits for the same site.  Both these essays -- one intact, one substantially altered for the post-9/11 world -- appear in &quot;The Partly-Cloudy Patriot&quot;, which was an easy purchase once I saw Vowell's name on the cover.<br />I confess, even though I hear a lot os in the former Confederacy, and walked hurriedly through the Book Depository museum at Dealey Plaza so I could get back to a hotel room in Arlington and watch the &quot;American Idol&quot; finale.  I think Vowell would approve of my choice (Ruben over Clay, that is).<br />The most timely topic in the collection is also one of the shortest articles: &quot;Rosa Parks, C'est Moi&quot;.  There's a universal truth here.  In American politics, once someone compares themselves to Thomas Jefferson, they've already lost the debate.  When a triumphant athlete quotes Lou Gehrig's &quot;luckiest man on the face of the Earth&quot;, you know he has well and truly lost the plot.  And when some cf NPR while driving cross-country for work, I've still never heard Vowell on the air.  I did see her on one of the first post-9/11 editions of &quot;Late Night with Conan O'Brien&quot;, but mostly I'm here as a fan of her written work, especialy her last collection, &quot;Take the Cannoli&quot;.  Like &quot;Cannoli&quot;, &quot;Patriot&quot; is a grab-bag of short features that mix Vowell's family life with her thoughts on American cultural heritage.<br />There's really not a bad article in the bunch, though I feel (as I did with the last book) that many of them end too abruptly, as if she were warming up to her theme and then suddenly moved on to the next topic.  She talks about the history of mapmaking, and then switches gears to eulogize that great evangelist, Tom Landry.  She never lingers on the subject long enough to beat it into the ground, and intentionally leaves a lot unsaid.<br />The book's centerpiece is &quot;The Nerd Voice&quot;, a proud article about the place of the nerd in American society, told in two parts -- first from the inauguration of George W. Bush, and then in an interview with &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; writer Doug Petrie.  A later chapter in the same vein cover's Vowell's fascination with America's most famous bookworm warrior, Teddy Roosevelt, who famously read &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; while on a cattle drive.  That fascinates me too.  I carried a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel through the battlefield at Shiloh.  No Teddy Roosevelt, I.<br />Along the way, Vowell schleps to Gettysburg, the Salem witch museums, an underground cafeteria at Carlsbad Caverns, and a local arcade where she plays penny basketball.  I really admire this lifestyle.  In the past year I have traipsed through two Civil War battlefieldheap dime-store iconoclast professes to be the next Rosa Parks, it's time to ask for the check.  Sarah Vowell probably could have gotten a whole book just out of this alone.. but settled for less than five pages.<br />Ideally, the next Sarah Vowell collection will feature a return to the Richard Nixon presidential libraries... in the midst of a mini-review of &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;.	2003-10-04
US	51345392	R1KPEYN9IDU37I	0553258478	734532649	Exodus	Books	4	320	337	N	N	Independence day	While at work this morning, I was shown an original birth certificate issued in Israel in 1950.  I actually felt something of a thrill of pride (even though I've never been there, and I've long since forgotten Hebrew letters).  That's mostly due to my having finished &quot;Exodus&quot; last night.<br />&quot;Exodus&quot; isn't the kind of book you read for literary merit.  The third word in the book is &quot;plip-plopped&quot;, which isn't a word at all.  If you're deconstructing page 1, you'll get annoyed the random shifts in the narrative voice.  The book begins with a couple of plodding middle-American characters with silly names like &quot;Kitty&quot;, and &quot;Mark Parker&quot;.<br />However, Uris knows what he's doing.  He's constructing an argument in favor of the state of Israel, laid out against 70 years' worth rampant European anti-Semitism.  It's no coincidence that the first segment recounts the Holocaust (first, in the eyes of a girl who escaped to relative peace in Jew-friendly Denmark, and then in the eyes of an Auschwitz survivor), and then the second shows the seeds of modern Israel through a pair of mythic-quality Russian shtetl refugees who enter Palestine in the 1880s and begin transforming the soil.  The balance of the book shows Palestine's struggles under the suffocating British mandate, and nascent Israel's miraculous victory over the various Arab states seeking to &quot;push Israel into the sea&quot;.  Played out over the epic history is a storyline involving the Ben Canaan family, Kitty the American nurse, her surrogate Israeli daughter Karen, and Karen's sullen, rebellious, Sal Mineo-type boyfriend Dov.  The body count rises and the deaths become more personal, more tragic, as the story builds its way slowly to several shattering conclusions.<br />A lot has changed since 1948.  Israel was then associated with the political left; not anymore.  The plight of the Palestine Arabs who were induced out of their land by the warfaring Arab states, however, has not been resolved.  Those refugees are still right there, crammed along the Israeli borders in the same makeshift cities.  Pages 551-554 of the book present a summary of this unconscionable situation, and just about every word is still true, 50 years later.  The joyously pro-Israel strains of &quot;Exodus&quot; will probably now draw more cynicism than solidarity, in this brave new world of the New York Times headlines and Saudi peace proposals.  However, I wouldn't change a word.<br />Except &quot;plip-plopped&quot;.	2003-09-24

Luciano was the larger-than-life ump (who met a too tragic end) with the penchant for over-the-top calls, and Kaiser the sidekicks featured in several of his anecdotes.<br />Kaiser's baseball career also met something of a tragic end, and he's been out of the game exactly four years now.  &quot;Planet of the Umps&quot; is his own attempt at setting the record straight, describing the horrible conditions that Major League umpires were subject to before the 1970s.<br />However, if some of the material here seems familiar, it's because... you've read it before.  Co-author David Fisher also ghost-wrote the Luciano memoirs.  Granted, I haven't read Luciano in a few years, but I recognized at least three stories recycled wholesale from those earlier books.  See pages 158, 167 and 172 for the repeat offenders.  And, if memory serves me right, the one on 172 actually has a different ending.<br />&quot;Planet&quot; also suffers from extremely poor editing and fact-checking.  Fisher spells several ump names incorrectly (here we read about Lee Wyer, Harry Wendlestat and Dutch Rennart), and, even worse, commits the Cardinal Baseball Sin: He misspells the name Ripken.  Come on!  The name Ripken appeared in major-league boxscores for 2,632 consecutive games... and also several All-Star games and three playoffs.  Why would anyone even think it's spelled &quot;Ripkin&quot;?  I'm sorry, but this incorrect spelling crops up so often I'm starting to doubt my own sanity.  <br />Fisher/Kaiser also describe several games precisely as they didn't occur.  The last out of Gaylord Perry's 300th career win, remembered on page 97, was not a strikeout.  Kaiser lovingly recalls the length (4 hours, 40 minutes) of a 14-inning Seattle-Anaheim game in the 1997 season... however, those two teams didn't ever play an extra-inning games that year.  In this era of Retrosheet, those mistakes are hard to forgive.  It only takes about 45 seconds of web time to verify details... why not just get it right?  Oh, and page 151 has the author watching ESPN several years before the network debuted.<br />Anyway.<br />&quot;Planet of the Umps&quot; is a short, easygoing read.  It's a good source of classic baseball stories, especially if you're new to baseball bios.  Baseball's own history is less than accurate, so you might easily forgive the lack of research.  You can finish the book in a day, and the final chapter describing the undeserved ending of Kaiser's career is still a sad one.  Buy the book, if even just to support the man himself.  Just don't believe everything you read!	2003-09-22
US	51345392	R11ER6U7Z9KAS8	1400033543	555874448	You Shall Know Our Velocity	Books	4	7	11	N	N	People like us just don't emote in the way he describes	Parts of \\"You Shall Know Our Velocity!\\" rank among the finest sentences of prose I've ever read.  Early in the book, the narrator and his friend propose traveling around the world east to west.  \\"We would oppose the turning of the planet, refuse the setting of the sun,\\" he says.  This is terrific stuff!  I got out my highlight pen (which I *never* do with books) and marked off a couple dozen really good passages throughout, stuff I'm still working into conversations days later (\\"You are wearing the same jacket... you must be hidden from view\\").<br />The problem is, the rest of the book is what the Brits call a \\"slog\\".  The idea is, narrator Will Chmielewski (the last name almost appears to be a joke on Eggers' part... investing months in his main character and then giving him an unpronouncable last name and using it only once) drags his friend \\"Hand\\" to the obscure corners of the globe, where they give away $32,000 in cash that he got for changing a light bulb.  Will's haunted by survivor's guilt over the death of a friend, and Hand sees the cash giveaway as a religious experience.  The rest of the book sees Will and Hand making every traveler's mistake possible... oversleeping, getting to the airport too late, going to the wrong country because they didn't know where Dakar was ... stuff like that.  The book is half travelogue (a passage on Greenland; Hand's belief that you can actually climb the Great Pyramid), and half internal monologue.<br />I really do think the way Will thinks.  Will describes a memory palace in which soft-footed troll-like creatures archive all his pain, and remind him of his life's errors at every possible moment.  Will's wrapped up in his own head, preoccupied with dying... like Eggers in his previous non-fiction book.  The joke is, Will does die young, as we learn on page one.<br />And then, just when you think Will's having a mental breakdown about 250 pages in... the narrative breaks, and we get a 20-page excerpt written by Hand, years later.  Hand debunks most of what we've learned from Will, and, more important, shows why Will thought he had to alter the truth for his book.  This is quite similar, of course, to the \\"Mistakes We Knew We Were Making\\" addendum to the \\"Staggering Genius\\" paperback.<br />I was really bored by a lot of the individual adventures Will and Hand get up to.  They're a couple of tools, doing silly things and making mistakes... but then Will comes right out and compliments a guy for using the word \\"derision\\", and says he always wanted to be the kind of guy who could conceive of aphorisms (\\"We are merely cargo\\") and work them into conversation.  Heck.  I always wanted to be a guy like that, too!  You come to like Will.<br />Towards the end of the novel, Will makes a lengthy invocation to his late friend, which is supposed to be the most powerful writing of the book.  Or maybe Eggers thinks so.  I skimmed through it... it was nearly unreadable.  But then, a few pages later, he and Hand climb trees and jump from branch to branch, just to see if it can be done.  They don't stay hurt long.<br />\\"Velocity\\" is really uneven.  I bought into most of Eggers' narrative tricks (or, if you will, post-modern panderings) in \\"Staggering Genius\\".  This book is the roman a clef version of \\"Staggering\\", and lacks the originality.  There's even a New York Times Book Review quote on the back about how \\"Velocity!\\" is \\"entirely honorable\\".  Please.  People like us just don't emote in the way book critics describe.	2003-08-30
US	51345392	R2VWT0YE1YVDBT	0452284058	210623756	What Every American Should Know About the Rest of the World: Your Guide to Today's Hot Spots, Hot Shots and Incendiary Issues	Books	1	21	38	N	N	Fails the litmus test	This book's a great idea on paper.  I remember shortly after 9/11 \\"The Onion\\" ran a satirical blurb on how to explain the terrorist attacks to schoolchildren.  Well, they did it just by telling the history behind Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda, point for point.  It was satire, because that's exactly what WON'T be taught to schoolchildren... but it was also true!<br />When presented with a copy of \\"What Every American Should Know...\\" I turned straight to the Israel/Palestine chapter.  Here's a complicated, controversial subject, to which the author devoted 13 pages.  So, a fair-sized representative sample chapter.  If the author got this bit right, then presumably everything else in the book would deserve similarly high marks.<br />Instead, I found a fast, tongue-in-cheek agglomeration of inflammatory phrases like \\"illegal settlements\\" and \\"land grabs\\".  Missing from the discussion are such important names as Abu Mazen,  Ehud Barak, the 2000-2003 (and counting) Intifada, and the peace proposal rejected by the PA just before that bloody uprising began.<br />It's hard to take seriously the description of the 1967 war as an Israeli \\"land grab\\", especially in a world in which Michael Oren's \\"Six Days of War\\" has already been published.  The Saudi Arabian peace proposal (involving a reversion of both countries to the pre-1967 borders) is given what appears to be an endorsement... as if the author believes there was peace in the region before 1967 borders.  The assertion that the US \\"almost always\\" supports Israel isn't ludicrous, but it's not far from ludicrous either.<br />At any rate, the Middle East conflict is misunderstood by many people on all sides, left, right, pro- and anti-.  It doesn't deserve this kind of rushed treatment, even in a book that's supposed to be a flash-card intro primer, with eye-pleasing maps, sidebars, factoids, and a little glossary.  If the author couldn't sell me on believing the facts in this chapter (and I just don't), I'm certainly not going to invest several days in the rest of the book.  Which is a shame.	2003-08-18

Pandora (introduced as \\"The Goddess Pandora\\" in Anne Rice's earlier \\"Queen of the Damned\\", the third book of the Vampire Chronicles) doesn't just tell her life story.  She recounts it, in journal form, for one-time old psychic detective (and now young immortal) David Talbot, at his request.  For the first several pages, Rice is basically clearing her throat, and Pandora expands on how wonderful it is to be alive... yet ... not alive, while admiring Talbot's impossibly well-sculpted physique.<br />Then we get into the story.  We meet Pandora as the enlightened, trouble-making daughter of a patrician Senator in Augustus Caesar's Rome, and how her family is brought to ruin by the back-room dealing of one of their own.  Pandora escapes to the ancient East, but then the dreeams begin.  Blood dreams.<br />What follows is that the dreams intensify, and Pandora's efforts to assert herself as an independent woman of means in Antioch are complicated both by the presence of a familiar traitor, and the confusing lust for blood.  Also in the mix is Marius, a hunky family friend who's now stronger, paler, and only visible at night.  The two stories dovetail in what appears to be just 24 hours of real time.  When the inevitable happens to Pandora, it's not a tragedy at all: immortality proves to be what she wants and embraces, even if she's not calling her own shots.<br />The writing, if you gloss past the Talbot prologue, is crisp and filled with a nouveau sort of \\"historical realism\\".  Rome is presented as you don't really get it in certain modern histories -- it's taken as a positive development that the Christianity is stripped away and the pagan religions remain intact,.  Certain characters are still prone to making speeches that last seven or eight pages, which you just have to take as a given in Rice's world and accept with a sigh.<br />\\"Pandora\\" doesn't so much create new myths in the world of the vampires, as it rather expands on the old ones and colors the borders a little bit.  It is nice, however, to get a Rice heroine who's more interested in being alive than dying, and who embraces the eternal night with an elan usually reserved for characters on \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\".	2003-08-17

In the ESPN.com vernacular of the present day, &quot;October 1964&quot; has recently been debunked (but lovingly) by columnist/author Rob Neyer.  While the two giants who square off in David Halberstam's tale of an evolving America in 1964 are the suffocating white Establishment (the Yankees) and the young minority upstarts (the Cardinals), Neyer's contention is that this watershed really occurred one year earlier.  That was, after all, the year the Yankees were memorably swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series.<br />However, Halberstam's take on the demise of the Establishment Yankees is the more accurate one.  The '63 World Series was won single-handedly by a couple of white guys, Koufax and Drysdale.  Yes, the Dodgers did have five black regulars in the starting lineup, but apart from the second inning of the opening game, they just didn't hit, or make history the way Koufax did.<br />The 1964 World Series was won by the heroics of men that the Yankees didn't understand, by men who couldn't play for the Yankees, by virtue of who they were.  The Yankees could accept being struck out 15 times by Sandy Koufax, but when they struck out 13 times against Bob Gibson -- on whom their sole scouting report was woefully inaccurate -- it was an outrage.  Gibson wasn't supposed to have courage, or determination!  Lou Brock wasn't supposed to get more hits in the Series than Mickey Mantle!<br />And yet, the '64 Yankees didn't go quietly in the Series, and in fact they scored more runs than St. Louis.  Mantle had an incredible seven games.  The Yanks had more walks and homers than the Cardinals, and their pitching (behind white youngers Jim Bouton and Mel Stottlemyre) basically matched St. Louis out for out.  At least on paper.  The Series turning point came when the Yanks' lone black pitcher, Al Downing, gave up a grand slam homer to a Southern good-ol'-boy, Ken Boyer.<br />This is why &quot;October 1964&quot; is a great book.  It's no mystery as to who the heroesare -- the book frontpiece is a team photograph, and that team isn't the Yankees.  However, the bad guys gave it a mighty effort.  40 years later, it's hard to remember how much the Yankees represented a world that simply had to end.  As someone born well after '64, I didn't even know at first that spring training in Florida was segregated that late.  The struggles of Gibson and Brock and Flood and Bill White were relatively new stories when Halberstam first told them.  Since Halberstam's skill is in creating whole lives in three or four pages, these mini-biographies are the heart of the book, and not the more desultory game descriptions that reduce the World Series to a sequence of monochrome postcards.<br />The best anecdote in the book has little to do with the World Series.  Yankee pitcher Ralph Terry, then a rookie, brashly introduces himself to a few old men watching a baseball game.  &quot;Well, Ralph,&quot; one of the men says.  &quot;my name is Cy Young.  And these fellas over here next to me are Zack Wheat and Ty Cobb.&quot;<br />If you subscribe to the theory of baseball as social history, &quot;October 1964&quot; is a book you'd do well to have on your shelf, and one worth reading every few years.	2003-08-17

Bob Woodward no longer has to plug after back-channel sources in order to write his fly-on-the-wall exposes.  Now all he has to do is visit George W. Bush in the Crawford, Texas ranch, and take a romantic walk with the President, at the end of which, both men throw pebbles at an ornate limestone formation thousands of years old.<br />&quot;Bush at War&quot; is indispensable reading, as it takes you right inside the White House for the planning of every jot and tittle of the late 2001 combat in Afghanistan.  From weekends at Camp David, to heated National Security Council debates, to the CIA's point man inside the Northern Alliance, to an evening with Derek Jeter at Yankee Stadium, this book probably uncovers conversations, the existence of which most other books could only guess at.<br />However, gauge for yourself just how much of the &quot;real&quot; story you're getting.  Yes, the transcripts are probably authentic.  However, in spite of the promises of &quot;deep background&quot;, the book is still told primarily from the point of Bush's war cabinet.  Apart from a few snide digs from one principal to another, there's not much here to satisfy the most brazen conspiracy theorists about Bush in Iraq, or Cheney and the oil junta.<br />Another point is that the Afghan story is basically without controversy, a war scorned by only the hardest of the hard-core left-wingers and an Islamic regime or two.  The conflict in Iraq has taken over the controversy in terms of international consideration, and &quot;Bush at War&quot; by fault of publication date can only take you through the early Iraq planning stages, and only in broad strokes at that.  Perhaps another Woodward volume will be in the offing once the dust settles over Mosul and Tikrit.<br />Bush comes off as a decent President in &quot;Bush at War&quot;.  Based solely on the information given, the most obvious flaw is that he's a President without vision.  Or rather, his sole vision is that he wants to have a big vision.  He speaks in broad terms about &quot;redefining the office&quot; and &quot;creating world peace&quot;, but never really seems to know how to accomplish that.  Even the narrative on the war in Afghanistan is structured so that the U.S.'s ultimate victory comes as a surprise twist.<br />30 years ago, maybe Bob Woodward could have told us the things we *didn't* know about Stage One of the war on terrorism, but this book remains an absorbing official look at the hidden story.	2003-08-01

However, the city council, parks commission, bank, top law firm, and newspaper, all wanted a new minor-league baseball stadium.  Guess who won?<br />Jim Bouton's \\"Foul Ball\\" is his second diary.  The first, of course, is \\"Ball Four\\", the seminal account not just of the short-lived 1969 Seattle Pilots (another victim of local politics and back-room deals) but of baseball on the brink of free agency.  That book turned Bouton into something of a pariah; he went from ballplayer to broadcaster within months of its release.<br />\\"Foul Ball\\" charts four months in 2001, as Bouton and business partner Chip Elitzer seek community and political support to renovate Pittsfield's existing stadium and attract a new minor-league franchise (after the Pittsfield Astros left town in favor of... a new stadium, out of state).  Just by the fact that this book was self-published, you can guess the outcome.  Bouton tracks the unfolding story town meeting by town meeting, threatening phone call by threatening phone call.  As with the \\"Ball Four\\" format, the action is liberally interspersed with anecdotes and updates from old friends.  Indeed, if \\"Ball Four\\" hadn't already been followed by \\"Ball Five\\", \\"Ball Six\\", and \\"The Final Pitch\\", this book could've been \\"Ball Seven\\".  Or \\"Juuuust A Bit Outside!\\".<br />To be honest, I really felt sorry for Bouton by the end.  Now in his 60s and living in the Berkshires, running his modest motivational speaking enterprise, Bouton in \\"Foul Ball\\" suffers setback after setback.  Apart from being pillaged daily by the local newspaper, he had to pull his book from its publisher and go the self-publishing route.  ESPN's SportsCentury feature on \\"Ball Four\\" is yanked from the schedule days before airtime.  The Seattle Mariners politely refuse to hold a Seattle Pilots reunion.  I kept waiting for the city of Pittsfield to trade Bouton for Dooley Womack!  Bouton's September 11th experiences are in the book, too.  I read that entry while riding New York City's \\"E\\" subway.  Which used to go to the World Trade Center.<br />\\"Foul Ball\\" contains lots of blood-curdling tales of local corruption and toxic waste dumping.  You may not support Bouton's near-Quixotic quest against the-powers-that-be, but this book certainly deserves to be read and heard.  Then check out the website for the Berkshire Black Bears to see how Pittsfield's new team is faring under someone else's ownership.	2003-06-19

I was in high school at the time, deep into my obsession with baseball books (the Mets were having an off-year).  I pounded through W.P. Kinsella's novel in days, then moved on to \\"The Iowa Baseball Confederacy\\", which freaked me out a little, and I never read Kinsella again.<br />Flash forward 13 years.  I chanced to see \\"Field of Dreams\\" on TV (the TBS \\"Dinner and a Movie\\" version) while marooned in a hotel during a business trip -- it was that, or watch Monica Lewinsky's \\"Mr. Personality\\".  I hadn't seen the movie in a few years, and was struck by how passionate it was about the 1960s.  The film's Kinsellas are hippie-era college protestors, and the script is drenched with '60s radical authors (the film's Terrence Mann) and a very lively debate about book burning.<br />None of that's from the book.<br />The novel's central idea is the same -- an Iowa farmer hears \\"a voice\\" (a PA announcer, not a dreamy whisper voiced by \\"Himself\\", as the film's credits have us believe), plows under his corn and builds a baseball diamond from the Earth.  The diamond remains derelict until Shoeless Joe Jackson and the rest of the disgraced 1919 World Series-fixing Chicago Black Sox come to play ball.  Add to the mix a small-town doctor whose major league career lasted 5 minutes, and a famously reclusive writer lured out of his shell by a love for the game.<br />But then also add into that mix an identical twin who's a carnival barker for circus freaks,  and a senile farmer whose life is built around the lie that he once played baseball for the Tinker-to-Evers-Chance era Chicago Cubs... here's the stuff not incorporated into the screenplay.  Neither are Kinsella or his wife '60s revolutionaries; they're just dreamers in their 20s.<br />It's Kinsella (the author)'s writing style that grates, more than anything else.  Try as I might, I could never warm up to Kinsella (the character)'s penchantto think in dreamy Earth metaphors, or to speak in poetic paragraphs.  His wife is described almost entirely by her bedroom habits.  \\"Shoeless Joe\\" is as much about family as about baseball, but by the time the identical twin brother shows up (and there are still 50 pages to go), I found myself flipping ahead to hurry up and get to the point.<br />\\"Field of Dreams\\" is an excellent movie, with a focused message and lively dialogue.  \\"Shoeless Joe\\" I will call an acquired taste, because you'll need to make a mental adjustment to the writing style, which is more syrupy than \\"literary\\".<br />One historical sidebar: Kinsella convinces J.D. Salinger to go to a Twins-Red Sox game at Fenway Park.  He describes the game in convincing detail -- who played, who homered, who pitched for Boston (Mike Torrez, who after 1978 also became a mythological figure, whose ghost will one day populate a baseball movie filmed in the year 2050).  And it's all fake!  No game like this was ever played in 1979, the year Kinsella sets the novel.  This has no signficance to anything but I was impressed by the effort.  We never learn how that game ends -- Kinsella slams his head into a concrete beam, and spends the final innings in the infirmary.  \\"Shoeless Joe\\" may be a spiritual fantasy, but I'm quite certain that this is the one scene in the book based on actual fact!	2003-06-15

ESPN.com site-goers had been treated to the same photo of Neyer in a flannel shirt since his column debuted.  Only John Kuenster of \\"Baseball Digest\\" used the same photo for longer.  Now Neyer's got a blue T-shirt and an eerily wide grin.  Why is this man smiling?<br />\\"Lineups\\" is a \\"comeback\\" book, after the self-published \\"Feeding the Green Monster\\" failed to make a splash.  \\"Lineups\\" opens, really, with its appendix, a tremendously useful spreadsheet listing every team's top regular at every position from 1901 through 2002.  This may be the first baseball book in years to print the name of Al Moran, the shortstop for your 1963 New York Mets (and what a shortstop!).<br />Working backwards from that chart comes a series of dream (and nightmare) teams from MLB's current 30 franchises.  The downside of this is that you're only reading about the Los Angeles Dogers, or the Atlanta Braves.  The now-defunct teams (Brooklyn, Boston/Milwaukee) don't get their own exclusive treatment, although the end of the book features joint chapters on the Brooklyn/LA Dodgers et al, which is not how I'd have done it.<br />This is a book best read in brief bursts, one team at a time.  With the shifted franchises treated separately, Neyer is weighted toward discussing the last 40 years.  However, there are some interesting \\"finds\\" here, especially for those less familiar with earlier baseball: The Yankees' best-ever left fielder is Charlie Keller, and the Cardinals' first-team rotation is rounded out by Lon Warneke.<br />The rest of the book is sidebars (mostly related to that page's lineup), and one feature article per team.  Neyer debates managers a lot: for Kansas City, Dick Howser v. Whitey Herzog; for the Yanks, Joe McCarthy v. Casey Stengel.  He also introduces  current perspective into the spectacular flameout of the Mets' \\"Generation K\\", and the woeful roster moves made bythe Tampa Bay Devil Rays.<br />Obviously, there's lots to argue with here.  Which is kind of the point.  When Neyer chides a \\"Sports Illustrated\\" writer for bashing the playoff performance of the Atlanta Braves bullpen, he presents only line stats in their defense.  He mentions the famous homers allowed by Charlie Liebrandt and Mark Wohlers, but neglects to mention the 1999 playoffs, when the Braves' pen blew late leads in 5 of 6 straight games against the Mets and Yankees.  Later on, he states that the Brewers are the only expansion team to generate 2 Hall-of-Famers in their first 10 years: which is only true if you ignore the Mets, Tom Seaver and Nolan Ryan.<br />The book's most innovative aspect is its \\"Traded Away\\" teams, which allow you to wince in pain with every passing name.  Least interesting (to me, anyway) were the \\"Iron Glove\\" teams.  Overall, though, like \\"Baseball Dynasties\\", this is a just plain nifty book to dip into.  If I were a broadcaster, this is the book I'd want with me, when the score's 10-3 in the 7th inning and it's time to start talking baseball history again.	2003-06-13

During his progression over 10 years from Yankees' fan-mail gopher during the Horace Clarke years, to PR director during the 1976 World Series, Appel had once-in-a-lifetime encounters (with the likes of Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Mike Burke, Gabe Paul, George Steinbrenner and ... Oscar Gamble) every single day.<br />&quot;Now Pitching...&quot;, finally out in paperback, shows Appel's origins as a Yankees fan when everyone else was rooting for the Brooklyn Dodgers, and how he turned his love for the game into a career (when everyone else was watching the NFL).  Most of the book covers the Yankees from 1968 to 1976, Appel's reign.  Although many of the stories are familiar to baseball readers from what seems like 100 other books, only Appel is giving you the inside view.  Nowhere else will you get such insider detail about Oscar Gamble's infamous haircut, Sparky Lyle's theme music, or George Steinbrenner's management style.<br />The book flags a little -- only a little -- when Appel leaves the Yankees and makes his mark in other ventures, such as team tennis and local NYC broadcasting.  The most interesting part focusses on Appel's brief fish-out-of-water turn with the 1996 Atlanta Olympics organizers.<br />Marty Appel's been a very lucky guy -- who else gets to be friends with both Mickey Mantle and Billie Jean King?  &quot;Now Pitching for the Yankees&quot; is several cuts above your standard baseball autobiography.	2003-06-12
US	51345392	R2DAAV50G1Q15C	0385508980	546276988	The Mad Dog 100: The Greatest Sports Arguments of All Time	Books	3	7	13	N	N	Mad Dog to go	In its full-sized hardcover edition, &quot;The Mad Dog 100&quot; is just small enough to bring into Yankee Stadium without a backpack.  Thus, without having to sneak your bag through security, you can get it into the bleachers and read a full chapter between innings.  Or while waiting for Nomar Garciaparra to finish adjusting his shoes and gloves.  You could probably finish the entire book by the 7th inning stretch (if not DURING the 7th inning stretch).<br />&quot;The Mad Dog 100&quot; is the first literary effort by Chris Russo, co-host of New York City's WFAN's popular afternoon call-in program &quot;Mike and the Mad Dog&quot;.  Russo's been with the station for about 15 years now, so maybe we can assume this book was at least a decade in the making.<br />The author biography informs us that Mad Dog &quot;also&quot; hosts a program on the &quot;new&quot; YES Network -- which is probably the TV version of the radio program, in which you can watch a fidgety Russo squirm his way through overlong interviews, or the 400-pound Mike Francesa not move a muscle between ad breaks.<br />The author is Allen St. John, known mostly for his more incisive sports commentary in the Village Voice.  I'm going to assume that the topics for &quot;the greatest sports arguments of all time&quot; were listed by Russo, and then written by St. John in Russo's &quot;voice&quot;.  I mean, in a chapter debating the greatest home-run record of all time (a &quot;chapter&quot; here consuming parts of three pages), Russo talks about researching Roger Maris's 1961 assault on Babe Ruth's 60 HR mark, and being &quot;surprised&quot; to learn that contemporary journalists actually favored the asterisk.  I think I was &quot;surprised&quot; to learn that Mad Dog actually DID research.  In which library did he spend his late nights, making sure that his non-fiction tome wouldn't betray those audiences who associate the brand name &quot;Mad Dog&quot; with 100% accuracy?<br />Most of the topics in the bookare interesting -- best NBA rivalries, worst trades in sports history; the things you'd actually find yourself debating with your friends or co-workers for about 90 seconds, and 90 seconds is all it takes to read Russo's opinion on the subject.  His &quot;analysis&quot; is really basic and you can even assume that some of the &quot;writing&quot; is just taken verbatim from the tapes of old Mad Dog radio programs.<br />I mean, what were you expecting?  Roger Angell? Bill James???	2003-06-10

Last week, the Dodgers came to Shea Stadium.  There's not a ballplayer left alive, except Jesse Orosco, who was born before the Dodgers left Brooklyn, but the residual anti-Dodger resentment which inhabits the ugly orange, blue, green and red seats at Shea still makes these games interesting.  The score was tied, 1-1 in the 6th, and LA had runners at first and third, with one out.  The batter hit a ground ball to Mets SS Rey Sanchez, less known for his .179 batting average than for reportedly getting a haircut in the clubhouse while the Mets getting clobbered in another loss.  Sanchez needed to do just two thing with that grounder, which was too slow to turn into a double play.  He needed to A) look the runner back to third and prevent the go-ahead run from scoring, and B) throw the batter out at first.<br />Sanchez, of course, failed to do either.<br />The runner on third scored (the winning run) and the batter was safe.  Sound familiar?<br />Jimmy Breslin's 1963 magazine-feature-length rumination on the woeful 1962 Mets (who lost 120 games -- more than the 1985 and '86 Mets lost *combined*) has fallen out of the baseball consciousness for a while.  But it's still hilarious.  The book is both a celebration of the underdog, and a scathing review of the National League's expansion process, which allowed for the creation of a new team full of players who simply couldn't play.<br />It takes a while for Breslin to actually get into game descriptions.  He talks at length about the building of Shea Stadium (which, true to Mets form, was completed a year late, and way, way over budget) -- \\"which they are building... for Marvin Throneberry\\".  He talks about original Mets owner Joan Whitney Payson (be warned that, since this book was written in 1963, she's still referred to as Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson without any sense of irony), and reprints some of manager Casey Stengel's unforgettable monologues.  He talks about the business of baseball, even in 1963 lamenting that toomany were in it for the money, and not for the love of the game.<br />Finally, Breslin gets to his recap of the Mets season, and gets it wrong from the very first inning.  He repeats -- actually, he creates -- the myth that the first run scored against the Mets in their first game, in St. Louis, came in when pitcher Roger Craig balked with runner Bill White on third.  Well, that never happened.  It happened, but it was already 1-0 at that point and White wasn't on third.  Since Breslin makes a big fetish of his scorecard later in the book, I have to assume this is dramatic license.<br />Breslin's book is now 40 years old, but if you went into a time capsule in '63 and came out again this April, you'd never realize that, for most of their history, the Mets were not actually this horrible.  When I have the choice of watching the Mets (who, in mid-May have already lost 60% of their games), or re-reading the epic saga of Pumpsie Green... well, just give me some more Pumpsie!	2003-05-10

I first picked up \\"The Beach\\" during the brief moment in my life when I briefly indulged my escapist fantasies.  It was winter in New York and I was studying for the bar exam, so that was when the backpacking idea hit me.  Never mind that I'd never spent so much as a single night of my life sleeping outdoors, and I'd never been to Asia.  The idea just seemed really neat.  So I got myself a movie-tie-in edition of \\"The Beach\\" (with Leo DiCaprio on the cover, but at least I had a temporary insanity defense) the Saturday before the exam, and wasted most of my remaining study time reading the book instead of my test prep.<br />I was very impressed with Alex Garland's writing style at the time.  His British backpacker Richard is distant and sardonic.  He doesn't get any romance in the book, although he starts receiving all-too-corporeal visitations from a dead man he hardly knows, and quite possibly sets a record for most drugs consumed in one novel.  The pop culture references fly fast and furious, and even in a world where pop culture \\"generations\\" pass every two to three years, the 1996 of \\"The Beach\\" -- and its protagonist born in '74, a year after me -- still seems famliar one.<br />Obviously, \\"The Beach\\" presents no paradise.  Richard risks his life three times just to get there, and quickly discovers several dark secrets at the heart of his island idyll.  The other commune dwellers are also backpackers -- vague, non-demoninational left-wing travellers, running away not so much from the world as from middle-class tourists.  Soon, some members of the by-invitation-only community are dead, others have food poisoning, and the batteries are dead in the island's one GameBoy.  Richard is banished to the island's cliffs, where he loses his mind and witnesses a moment of unspeakable horror.  Things do turn out all right for the 4 or 5 characters we actually care about, and Garland pulls no punches in the end.<br />My backpacker fantasy ended 2 weeks after it started, and remained unfulfilled.  This book certainly didn't help prolong it, mostly 'cause Garland never provided a satisfactory answer as to what backpackers use in lieu of toilet paper.  I wasn't quite as enthralled after a second reading, with the surprise factor gone.  I still recommend this book as superior to the movie, which curiously eliminates one of the book's more interesting characters (Jed) and alters two very creepy moments at the end to something less than scary.	2003-05-09

I found its Tourettic main character Lionel Essrog, so compelling, that my mood was instantly elevated, and I stayed at that job probably far longer than I should have.  Now I have a much better job, so I went back for a second read, and was happy to find the book held up so well.<br />Lionel, the detective and narrator of &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, is prone to sudden verbal tics -- he'll start rhyming his own name, for example -- or to adjusting people's collars.  This makes him perhaps the most unsuited detective in the history of the genre.  He would certainly not be out of place in a Coen Brothers movie (I'm thinking John Turturro here, or maybe Steve Buscemi, who read the audiobook).<br />Indeed the whole plot is Coen-esque.  Lionel and three other characters are runners for a very small-time Brooklyn mob associate named Frank Minna, in the decidedly unglamorous Boerum Hill neighborhood.  When Minna is found dead in a dumpster by the Pulaski Bridge (a horribly prosaic fate), his men are hunted one by one, and it's up to Lionel to find out who done it, and why.  Jonathan Lethem populates the story with oddly-named characters such as Kimmery and Mr. Foible and Detective Seminole.  With a world full of names such as these, it's easy to see why Lionel tics as much as he does.<br />Along the way are fascinating asides into how Lionel's mind works.  He notes that Prince is perhaps the first Tourettic singer, and there's a glorious two page essay on the MAD Magazine art of Don Martin.  Lethem also throws in some great New York-specific baseball references (Lee Mazzilli, Bucky Dent), and has Lionel think, while eating soup, &quot;Tinker to Evers to chicken&quot;.<br />The mystery held less of my attention on the second read-through; for some reason, I was more confused than I was the first time.  I think the two New Jersey gangsters, Matricardi and Rockaforte (or &quot;Bricco and Stuckface&quot;) are a little off-key, but perhaps that's because they both have the overly-precise speech patterns of Joe Mantegna (&quot;We wish to comfort you on this day of pain and misunderstanding...&quot;).<br />On the whole, &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; is a very inventive spin on language, and uses its New York setting extremely well, hitting everything from the pattern of Upper East Side traffic lights, to the solitude of the G train.  I dare you read it, and then not have Lionel-esque verbal tics for days afterward.  Liable Guessfrog!	2003-04-30

I picked this book up not because of Michael Chabon's rising literary reputation, or because of the Pulitzer Prize tag on the front cover.  Instead, I read it because it was about comics.  Not that I'm what you'd term a comics fanatic.  I read \\"Superman\\" and \\"Batman\\" as a kid, know all the theme songs to the Marvel Superheroes, and own \\"The Essential Silver Surfer\\".  But neither is \\"Kavalier & Clay\\" just about comics.  It's about the American invention of the art form -- in a 1930s New York I've learned about so often (from Ebbets Field, to the Empire State Building, to the World's Fair) that I'm surprised to find I wasn't actually there to remember it.  And it's also about the Golem of Prague, and the Holocaust survivor's guilt, and about the futility of war -- not just in a \\"Saving Private Ryan Sense\\", but in a surreal 50-page detour to the lone American outpost at the South Pole.  If the whole of 20th century American heartbreak isn't contained in this book's 600-plus pages, I'd be surprised.<br />I've read \\"Kavalier & Clay\\" twice now.  The first time, I read it to follow the plot.  The second time, I focussed on two additional elements.  One, the book's real superhero.  Not \\"The Escapist\\", not \\"The Four Freedoms\\" -- although their adventures are so carefully detailed, you'll almost think Chabon came up with the ideas when he was 8 and had been sitting on them ever since.  This book's real superhero is protagonist Josef Kavalier: an amateur escape artist from Nazi-occupied Prague, all of 19, who escapes to America in mythical company.  His ultimate fate follows twists surely more bizarre than the Red Kryptonite or the identity of the New Herald of Galactus.  Kavalier is a great literary invention, and it's surprising that he doesn't actually take literal flight on the final page.<br />Second, the satire.  Can you believe, the first time around I didn't pick up on the apocryphal reference to the \\"future massive grounds of New York University's Levine School of Applied Meteorology\\"?  Even the footnotes bear careful attention.  Chabon claims to have found, in 1993, a long-lost volume of '30s pulp adventure (a book entitled, promisingly, \\"Racy Attorney #23\\") -- at an IKEA in Elizabeth, New Jersey, as a prop for the floor model of a \\"Hjorp\\" wall unit.  Of course!  Orson Welles and Salvador Dali show up briefly, not how you'd expect them.  There's a Gabby Hartnett reference so obscure that Hartnett's survivors probably wouldn't even get it.  The most chilling word of the book is also found in a footnote.  It's the word \\"lost\\".<br />The book ends, breathlessly, in 1954.  Long Island's suburbs have been carved out of the potato fields of Islip.  Senator Kefauver has come to town, the Klaymans of Brooklyn have become Clays, and a priceless lifetime collection of comic books is about to meet an uncertain fate.  Each of these alone would be a poignant reminder of innocence lost, but Chabon hits us with it all at once.  \\"Kavalier & Clay\\" may have bitten off a little more than it could chew (reportedly the screenplay has already gone through 8 drafts), but take your time, and don't miss a page.	2003-04-29
US	51345392	R335Z7DBEVE289	0060508248	545561106	Perfect I'm Not: Boomer on Beer, Brawls, Backaches, and Baseball	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Don't believe the hype	I'm not sure why David Wells was slapped with a six-figure fine over this book. Most of the \\"controversy\\" appears to be caused by out-of-context quotes randomly selected by the press. The supposed negative statements about teammates Mike Mussina and Roger Clemens are spoken in the larger context of praising their baseball skills. The much-criticized \\"25 to 40 percent\\" statistic of ballplayers who use illegal steroids and performance-enhancing drugs (\\"10 to 25%\\" is the number in the edited book) is part of an enlightening discussion of how Jose Canseco went from being a minor-league toothpick, to a tree trunk with 462 career home runs (and a book deal of his own).<br />Anyway, this book is just plain funny. Most sports biographies are written by sportswriters: half of them by Dick Schaap, half by Peter Golenbock, and Catfish Hunter for some reason chose Armen Keteyian. Wells goes with comedy writer Chris Kreski, best known for William Shatner's non-fiction epics, and \\"Growing Up Brady\\". Kreski's also a lifelong Mets fan, which makes the book easier for me to read, certainly. His ability to recap baseball games is only adequate -- he makes some minor factual errors, misspells some of the player names Wells dictated into the tape recorder, and gives Wells an impossibly specific memory about old games (\\"Two hours and forty-eight minutes later, 49,328 screaming fans watched me ...\\") -- but gives Boomer plenty of jokes and cutting insights into the many peaks and valleys of his career.<br />Wells decries the corporate naming of Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, saying that to him, it'll always be the Jack Murphy Stadium of his youth. Which is a wonderful sentiment... and wrong, since it was actually called San Diego Stadium until Wells was 17.<br />Boomer doesn't use the space to get on a soapbox and preach about baseball. No diatribes about interleague play, or the wild card. Wells is more interested in topless girls in the stands during spring training. He's clearly havingtoo much fun in the major leagues to worry about salary caps and the fate of small market teams. Who would you rather read, Wells meeting Metallica's Lars Ulrich and describing Joe Torre's shock at AC/DC lyrics, or Whitey Herzog's whining about salary arbitration.<br />For a quick spring-training read, it's hard to get more entertaining than \\"Perfect I'm Not\\". If nothing else, hopefully Boomer will get his penalty money back in additional sales. And then lose twice to the Mets this summer.	2003-04-15
US	51345392	R382M8GFQQ3I2D	0374281602	721325086	Reversible Errors: A Novel	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Law & Order: Criminal Intent	\\"Reversible Errors\\" is another complex, multi-level Scott Turow legal (not courtroom) thriller, plodding at times, but on the whole, rewarding.  Read so soon after John Grisham's \\"The Summons\\", one comes to the conclusion that, although Turow's book is far better on about 1,000 different levels, Grisham's is still the more fun to read.<br />Turow's latest hardcover skips back and forth in time between 1991 and 2001, comparing and contrasting the arrest of small-time pickpocket Rommy \\"Squirrel\\" Gandolph for a notorious triple-murder on the 4th of July, with his subsequent last-ditch appeals from Death Row.  The main characters in this drama are helpfully laid out, in chart form, on the book's opening page.  Out to bust Gandolph are Detective Larry Starczek (a WASPy version of \\"Law & Order\\"'s Lenny Briscoe) and assistant prosecutor Muriel Wynn.  Out to save Gandolph a decade later is depressed corporate lawyer Arthur Raven, and disgraced trial-court judge Gillian Sullivan.  Naturally, each pair becomes romantically linked, even before you can mentally cast them.  You can chart Gandolph's fate in the novel by the direction in which each romance heads.  To reveal who's together at the end of the book, and who isn't, is to spoil whether or not Gandolph is spared the death sentence.<br />\\"Reversible Errors\\" features several interesting, flawed characters, each acting in what they believe to be their own best interest.  Turow never passes judgment, even on his characters who end the novel at rock-bottom.  The zealous cop and the earnest defense attorney are basically portrayed at equal footing.  The sex is... well, not glamorous at all.  Both Turow and Grisham tend to shy away from the boudoir, but when Grisham goes inside, the results are a lot more Hollywood.<br />For all the intricate plotting and layers of surprise revelations, Turow still doesn't hide the ball exceptionally well.  The name of a character introduced midway through the book is such a transparent pseudonym that, for 100 pages, I thought the big revelation would be that it wasn't a pseudonym at all.  Following up on the up-close look at Lou Gehrig's disease in Turow's previous \\"Personal Injuries\\" (an excellent novel), this book features characters with terminal cancer and schizophrenia.  I found myself feeling a bit hypochondriac by the end.<br />However, when complex characters earnestly discuss law and ethics for 400 pages, it's hard not to get drawn into their intricate worlds.  The law is realistically portrayed, and the few courtroom scenes are believably intense.  These are attorneys with ideals, with ethics.  Compared with Grisham, who hardly ever ventures inside the courtroom at all these days, it's clear that Turow is still the champ of the true legal thriller.	2003-03-28

Barcelona erupts with internal violence, as various nationalist, fascist, and socialists forces struggle in a burgeoning Civil War.  Guernica, meanwhile, is viciously firebombed by the real German enemy.<br />And the Doctor has lost the TARDIS, again.<br />\\"History 101\\" is the second and final \\"first novel\\" of the Eighth Doctor range in 2002.  Like Paul Ebbs' \\"Book of the Still\\", Mags Halliday's debut book is overloaded with characters, ideas, and concepts.  Unlike \\"Book of the Still\\", however, this story's central notion calls out for a more understated presentation.  The back cover blurb has an amusing conceit that this is actually history text presented in fictional form, but don't be fooled -- the book doesn't read that way.  The rest of the way, a bunch of characters clang into each other repeatedly in various parts of Spain.  Some characters even have 2 or 3 separate roles to play throughout the book, which obviously adds to the confusion.<br />At the core, what Halliday is trying to say (I think) is that history is not a set text, but rather a struggle between forces for control over the perception of what actually happened.  Then again, I was only a history major for a semester and a half of college, and I wasn't very good at it, either.  This concept is presented in the form of an alien race called The Absolute, which in its attempts to understand this difficult time in European history, ends up causing havoc with the timeline.  What happens in Spain is really backdrop to a lot of talking and theorizing -- this adventure is not the straight historical, at which \\"Doctor Who\\" has excelled in the past.  There is a big riot at the end (with a polite body count), but, especially on the first read-through, it's a muddled job figuring out who's who and what's what over the first 200 pages, so the stakes seem very small.  And that's a point in itself -- the Spanish Civil War is not one of the Top Ten events of the 20th century -- but not a very interesting novel.  There are allusions to Sartre and Picasso and Gaudi, but not deep enough to generate much interest.<br />If you have the patience to go back and reread portions of the text, \\"History 101\\" does resolve itself and become more enjoyable when you mentally separate out the wheat from the chaff.  I still haven't figured out exactly what Sabbath was supposed to be doing, however.  Maybe I'll pick it up again someday and figure it out.	2003-02-20

He's blown up his home planet, lost one of his hearts, spent a hundred years in exile in England, made a new mortal enemy, and, very unsuccessfully, run a brothel.  In the middle of all this, the TARDIS materializes in a world populated entirely by cartoon characters from the Warner Brothers and Hanna-Barbera universes.  Or, rather, since the BBC doesn't spend a lot of copyright clearance money on these \\"Who\\" books, nifty imitations thereof.  Author Steve Lyons hits all the obvious targets, and a few not-so-obvious ones, in his exploration of what would happen when British sci-fi icons interact with famous American cartoon characters.<br />Thing is, why does Lyons take this setup so seriously?  Within 50 pages of the TARDIS's arrival, Fitz has fallen in love with Penelope Pitstop, and Porky Pig's tried to kill himself.  Later, Tom goes on trial for the brutal murder of Jerry, there's a massive riot (complete with deadly anvils) and Scooby-Doo... well, nothing bad happens to Scooby-Doo.  But \\"Crooked World\\" is still a whole lot more somber than you'd expect for a book with Road-Runner on the cover.<br />\\"Crooked World\\" is a short read (240-odd pages with really large print) and even a ponderous reader like me finished it in just two days.  All the old cartoon conventions are pointed at and exploited, and everyone goes away happy, be it time-traveller or Deputy Dawg (or was that Huckleberry Hound?).  Steve Lyons' \\"Who\\" books tend to be either widely satirical or overly somber.  \\"Crooked World\\" blurs the lines together and, in the midst of a pretty serious run of \\"Who\\" books (that will get even more serious before the entire 2002 production run is out), provides some of the louder laughs of the year.	2003-02-16

I wondered why you, David Baldacci, and James Patterson, all went there in the same year.  Do you all share the same agent?  Are you all the same person?  Will Nelson DeMille write a love story next?  Anyway, it's nice to have another fat paperback potboiler every winter.<br />I do wonder why your novels get shorter every year.  In paperback, \\"The Chamber\\" was 650 pages long.  That took me a week to finish!  But \\"The Testament\\" was 550 pages long, \\"The Brethren\\" was 450, and \\"The Summons\\", your latest, isn't even close to 400!  So I finished it in only three days.  What on Earth am I supposed to do until next winter?  Reread \\"The Partner\\"?  Well... I wouldn't go that far.<br />I suppose that \\"The Summons\\" is another dark comedy.  A burned-out lawyer find millions of dollars of cash in a shoebox, and takes increasingly weird evasive measures, as nameless, non-denominational gangsters shoot at him.  This reminds me a lot of \\"The Big Lebowski\\" by the Coen Brothers, but Jeff Bridges wasn't a lawyer, and there's no sidekick as hilarious or memorable as John Goodman.  There was a returning character played by Oliver Platt in the movie version of \\"A Time To Kill\\", which isn't the same thing at all.<br />I enjoyed \\"The Summons\\" a lot.  I had the mystery figured out by page 113!  Which means you fooled me, because most other people had it figured out by the end of the back-cover blurb.  And why have there been exactly 39 chapters in each of your last 4 or 5 books?    I can't figure out what's so special about that number.  I did enjoy the funny observations about small-time lawyers, and what they think about their richer counterparts.  I was educated by the chapters describing multi-billion dollar tort litigation, and those that took place on a boat christened \\"The King of Torts\\" -- which is also the title of your next book.  Maybe I should have theending of that book figured out before it's even printed?<br />Thanks again, and see you for two days next winter!	2002-12-29
US	51345392	RGAELGSZOSXHD	0060195339	45372276	Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Perfect	\\"Sandy Koufax: A Lefty's Legacy\\" is one of the best baseball player biographies I've read in years.  Author Jane Leavy blends a brilliant mix of Koufaxian fastballs (interviews) and curveballs (unexpected historical finds) in following the course of the Dodger ace lefty's perfect game against the Chicago Cubs on September 9, 1965.<br />\\"Koufax\\" gets off on a shaky note, as Chapter 1 is devoted to a mind-numbing study of the mechanics of Koufax's overhand pitching delivery.  Then again, in two of Koufax's most famous performances, both well-detailed in this book, Sandy had a rough first inning as well.  The rest of the book takes off pretty quickly thereafter and becomes absolutely un-put-downable.<br />The straightforward biography tells the curve (all right, I'll stop with the puns now) of Koufax's career, from his childhood in Bensonhurst to his surprise retirement from the game shortly after his 27-win 1966 campaign.  Leavy draws on background interviews with Koufax (but doesn't quote him directly), and on many other interviews with his friends and teammates, from Brooklyn to Los Angeles.  Along the way she uncovers a surprising mixture of statistics and modern-bay baseball interpretation, quoting from two websites dear to the current baseball cognoscenti, Retrosheet and the Baseball Prospectus.  There's also, as you'd expect for any book that spans the 1950s and '60s, a decent canned social history of the era.  I don't think even Leavy believes that Koufax's retirement marked the defining point between the end of Eisenhower's and the beginning of Nixon's, but the parallels are there if you want to play with them.<br />Interspersed with the biographical chapters is an inning-by-inning account of Koufax's perfect game, pitched at night in Los Angeles in the twilight of his career.  These chapters are mind-blowing.  Spending a book describing a single ballgame is a risky proposition (all those endless asides turned \\"Nine Innings\\" into something nearly unreadable),but Leavy paints a compelling you-are-there freshness, thanks in part to the serendipitous discovery of the final 7 innings of that game on audiotape.  Wisely, Leavy allows Vin Scully's play-by-play to describe most of the late action, and Vin makes for remarkable reading in the same way that he makes for remarkable listening.  His extemporaneous game descriptions are brilliant and the quotes here make it easy to see why, like Koufax, he's regarded as being at the top of his league.<br />The book ends with a brief overview of Koufax's retirement (best line of the book: Koufax briefly handed out business cards describing himself as a \\"Peregrination Expert\\").  Leavy balances the prevailing view of Koufax (sullen, baseball-hating) against the reality she's uncovered, and Koufax comes away a healthy, well-rounded character.  No hagiography, \\"Koufax\\" is instead an respectful portrait of a unique man.<br />No description of Sandy Koufax is complete with discussion of his Judaism, and his seminal decision to skip Game 1 of the 1965 World Series, which fell on Yom Kippur.  Leavy indulges in some detective work to show that Koufax didn't even go to synagogue that afternoon, but she offers enough anecdotal evidence to almost make you believe that Koufax alone ended most of the anti-Semitic stereotypes that prevailed in America through 1965.  Almost.  I remember learning about Koufax in Hebrew day school as a child (in a pamphlet about Jewish sports legends only marginally bigger than the one in the movie \\"Airplane!\\"), but his significance to the religion makes a lot more sense as Leavy tells it.  There's even an interview with Shawn Green, the latest Jewish All-Star to sit on Yom Kippur.<br />Leavy leaves no stone unturned, and now I'm as close as I'll ever be to actually becoming a Los Angeles Dodgers fan.  Well, not even close... I'm genetically bred to loathe them, even as I reluctantly root for the team now mismanaged by Koufax's childhood pal Fred Wilpon.  But I will bereading this book again, the sooner the better.	2002-12-24

Let's get one thing clear up front: \\"Long Bomb\\" is not, repeat, NOT, the definitive history of the XFL.  The XFL doesn't deserve a definitive history!  \\"Long Bomb\\" instead is a neat little slice of gonzo journalism; an extended magazine piece showring Vince McMahon's year-long football hybrid with all the sardonic barbs it so richly merited.<br />What sold me on the book was author Brett Forrest's photo and author blurb, which talks about how he squandered his book advance on gambling and booze.  He even looks like the kind of guy you'd expect would go undercover with minor-league quality football players for a year, just to get a book deal.  There is no more perfect man to describe the XFL.<br />Actually, the XFL defies description.  It sounded like a good concept at the time -- a stripped-down, bare-bones football league, without the attendant NFL media hype and over-management (like the gritty, muddy, audience-free football scenes in the movie version of \\"North Dallas Forty\\").  The problem is, XFL went right out and got everything wrong: it was all about the fireworks and McMahon-staged theatrics, and the players couldn't play.  The league was \\"unscripted\\", but non-competitive -- all teams were owned by the league, an idea so awful that Major League Baseball went right out and copied it by purchasing the Montreal Expos.  XFL couldn't lure talent away from the college campuses, so the teams were comprised of injured collegiates and retreads from the CFL or (even worse) NFL Europe.  Their star attraction was a player who wore the phrase \\"HE HATE ME\\" on the back of his jersey.  HE HATE ME was a running back who couldn't run.  And now you know... the rest of the story.<br />Forrest's disdain for the entire misbegotten project pervades every page of the book.  His recaps of the error-filled TV broadcasts are a hoot, and even by the final weeks of the season, when the ratings were gone and the Cheerleader Cam was shut off, he doesn't spare any bile.  Forrest is more fair to the players and producers who granted him interviews or access, but even then we're allowed to see how empty HE HATES ME's home life is, or how sad it is when Las Vegas quarterback Ryan Clement retells the same tired college bowl triumph to the same disinterested crowd.<br />There are some hideous turns of phrase in the book: \\"In a season that lasted two fistfuls of games, the XFL was about to begin its second hand\\".  A list of nasty adjectives used in the book would be longer than this review, although Forrest is neutral when it comes time to describe McMahon's near-shoving match with Bob Costas (he sneers at both sides!).  He clearly admires Jesse Ventura, erstwhile XFL broadcaster and governor, but doesn't spare us Ventura's lack of ability to spin on-air phrases (see the title of this review for a great example).<br />Take \\"Long Bomb\\" for what it is: a bitterly funny and mercifully brief post-mortem of a spectacular TV failure.  If you remember anything at all about the XFL (and I watched all of 45 seconds), this book is a great features-eye view of all the ways in which it went wrong.	2002-12-19

Paul Ebbs' debut is bursting with three, seven, oh... eleven different plots.  It's so busy being fresh, raw, inventive, and in-your-face, that it's not quite up to the task of remaining coherent, or particularly enjoyable.  The ending makes very little sense upon first reading, which isn't a fatal defect in and of itself, but if you're going to go that route, you need to make the book appealing enough so the reader wants to take a second stab at it.<br />At heart, this is a book about the actual Book of the Still -- a lifeline for stranded time-travelers.  That's a great concept!  At heart, &quot;Still&quot; is also about a &quot;Total Recall&quot;-esque escort agency on the debauched planet Lebenswelt.  It's about the waltzing cotillion planet of Antimasque.  And about a race of brutal, naive time-travelers called the Unnoticed (ha!).  Also about a woman's touching search for her lost-in-time father -- and about another woman's addiction to the energies stored in frequent time-travelers.  With all this going on, it's a wonder why the back-cover blurb sees fit to spoil the story all the way up to about page 162 -- other blurbs in this series only give away the first 40 pages, and &quot;Still&quot; could have benefited doubly well from such parsimony.<br />The writing style is very inventive and visual.  The prologue and epilogue are switched around.  The opening chapter is titled &quot;Obligatory Spectacular Opening&quot; (so fey, it hurts!).  There's an extended fantasy sequence of &quot;Highlander&quot;-type swashbuckling.  Two delirious chapters are done as an Indian movie musical -- an idea so funny, you can't believe it hasn't been done before.<br />All this is the book equivalent of &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; (or better, &quot;Itchy &amp; Scratchy: The Movie: The Novel&quot; by Norman Mailer).  The book never goes where you expect, and relies on a lot of smoke and mirrors to conclude.  The problem is, visual as &quot;Book of the Still&quot; is, it's not a movie -- or a TV show -- it's a novel, and thus requires a little more patience.  Not on the reader's part, but on the author's.	2002-12-16

Especially those of Ford Frick (1949-1964), who also put in a number of years as sportswriter, Babe Ruth's ghostwriter, and President of the National League.<br />Frick wrote in 1972, a watershed year for baseball.  Labor strife was on the rise -- baseball experienced its first work stoppage -- but the owners had won a big victory by turning Curt Flood's challenge of the reserve clause, and certainly no-one expected free agency to impact the game as much as it did.  The designated hitter was still in the future, as was the utter elimination of daytime World Series games.  There was no interleague play, no international baseball, no George Steinbrenner.  In that sense you can read his book as the last of the &quot;old guard&quot;: Commissioners are now executives working on behalf of the owners, a job description not held by Frick.<br />&quot;Games, Asterisks, and People&quot; is not a biography, however.  Frick mostly wrote grandiose statements about baseball's future, and we learn very little of Frick's career, except that which the reader presumably knows going in.  What few personal anecdotes there are are usually told anonymously.  Even though the word &quot;asterisk&quot; is in the title of the book -- an allusion to Frick's ruling which denied, for many years, sole status to Roger Maris as baseball's single-season Home Run king -- Frick devotes merely one peevish page to brushing off complaints.  &quot;No asterisks, no apologies,&quot; he states.  Certainly no apologies to Maris.<br />When Frick talks about what he sees as the future of baseball, he's fairly good at predicting details.  When he names cities he thinks are ripe for expansion, he correctly identifies Toronto, Phoenix, Miami, Seattle, and Denver.  He narrowly avoids endorsing interleague play and the DH rule, both of which are here to stay.<br />Less prescient were Frick's gloom-and-doom predictions about TV money and the elimination of the reserve clause.  Certainly he didn't see the rise of free agency or the astronomical salaries that resulted.  He believed that the TV bubble will &quot;burst&quot;, which turned out to be funny in retrospect (to be fair, there were 3 channels in Frick's day and 500 in Bud Selig's).<br />More poignantly, Frick seemed to realize that he was writing from a watershed moment, and that the old guard he represented was going to vanish forever.  In that respect, most of his book is a glowing tribute to baseball from its rural mid-American roots, to the golden age of Cobb, Ruth, Johnson and Mathewson.  It's a history of the sport told by one who loved the game practically from birth, speaking to an audience far removed from Frick's time.  While his writing style is distant and dry, one can almost feel the urge to sit by Frick's armchair and listen to more stories about the old days, as told by a really distant uncle.<br />Frick served baseball for half a century, and during his time saw baseball evolve from Babe Ruth to Hank Aaron.  If you draw a list of the 20 most influential non-players in baseball history, Frick is on your list.  However, his memoirs are not a tribute to his legacy and certainly not as detailed as other biographies of that era (&quot;Veeck as in Wreck&quot;, &quot;Ball Four&quot;).  One day, Bud Selig will author a book of similar quality.  If we're not lucky.	2002-12-10

What's Carl Bernstein up to?  Never mind about that.  &quot;The Final Days&quot; is still not to be missed, over 25 years since it, too, became a best-seller.  The country has moved on to other pressing political matters, but interest in the unravelling of the Nixon Administration remains high.  Books speculating about the identity of Deep Throat seem to come out annually.<br />&quot;The Final Days&quot; is marked departure from &quot;All the President's Men&quot;, the first Woodward/Bernstein book and obviously the one that put them on the map.  Whereas &quot;President's&quot; was the inside story of two journalists chasing down a story that led higher into the U.S. government than they ever dreamed imaginable, &quot;Final Days&quot; is a step back, since neither Woodward nor Bernstein (nor Deep Throat, for that matter) appear as characters.  The focus turns to Nixon's family and close political advisers.  Many of the oft-mentioned names remain relevant today: Pat Buchanan, Diane Sawyer, Henry Kissinger.  It's also about twice as long as the earlier book, but reads just as quickly.<br />&quot;Final Days&quot; is divided into two parts.  First is a general overview of the first two years of the Watergate Crisis, this time told from the view of all the President's men rather than from the Washington Post.  Next is a dizzying chapter-a-day sequence of the final 17 days of the Nixon administration.<br />In the midst of the research are some surprisingly interesting detours.  Nixon's final foreign journey as President is to the Middle East.  A funny aside details how the White House press office had to avoid mentioning Israel on the same page of press releases naming other countries in the region, to avoid offending Islamic governments.  Also amusing is the lengthy description of Nixon son-in-law David Eisenhower's obsession with fantasy baseball.<br />25 years, numerous Presidential scandals, and a war or two later,  the undoing of Richard Nixon remains riveting and required reading.  The Woodward/Bernstein books blaze with a you-are-there immediacy, and even the overuse of passive voice doesn't slow down the narrative.  Every hour of mind-numbing research underpinning the book has paid off, because the story told is seamless.  There's dramatic tension to every decision Nixon makes in his final month in office: to resign or stay in office?  To surrender his private tapes, or continue the legal battle?  Nixon himself even becomes a sympathetic figure, as the debilitating nature of his phlebitis is explored.<br />Perhaps you're busying reading Woodward's latest effort now.  Perhaps you're numbed by his almost annual hardcover tomes about the private lives of American presidents, each less relevant than the last.  At any rate, &quot;The Final Days&quot; is a detour well worth your time, whether you're on the left, the right, or above all that.  It's surely no coincidence that Barbara Olson's excoriation of the Clinton White House bears the same title.	2002-12-09

On the other hand, I'm quite sure that when it does happen, very rarely is the occasion as voluble as &quot;Happy Endings&quot;.<br />50 volumes of original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels was, make no mistake, a big deal.  Where most tie-in novels supplement an ongoing TV series (the gold standard being &quot;Star Trek&quot;), the New Adventures of Doctor Who had a different aim: to replace a series that ended two years before the first book came out.<br />&quot;Happy Endings&quot; was penned by Paul Cornell, the first star of the NAs: in 1991, he became the first previously-unpublished author to get his first book deal through the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; book line.  Cornell in this book writes the wedding of a character he created: Professor Bernice Summerfield, the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; cast regular who never appeared on TV.  And he places the book in  the year 2010, in a setting he created: the pastoral British village of Cheldon Bonniface.  Beyond that, Cornell also includes characters from nearly all of the 49 previous NAs, and is allowed to tie up several dangling plot threads from those earlier books.<br />Apart from all the celebrating and indulgent literary tricks, &quot;Happy Endings&quot; is not a book to be read on its own.  There's not much plot, apart from the wedding and just a couple of minor alien nuisances.  This is a flat-out camp comedy, and extremely British in style.  Many characters burst into song (not an easy thing to do on the printed page).  Peppered throughout are numerous asides on how Cornell presumably would like society to look in the year 2010: the English monarchy is dissolved, the whole country's gone vegetarian, and a Wiccan handfasting ceremony is the book's emotional touchstone.<br />In the end, when the humor and social commentary subside, &quot;Happy Endings&quot; remainss a charming novel.  If you followed the earlier books in the series, you'll enjoy the return of all the prior characters.  Certainly when a series reaches a certain point, it's allowed to rely heavily on its past (think how the 7th season premiere of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; concluded with a lengthy parade of every major villain from the show's past).<br />However, the line of original DW adventures that &quot;Happy Endings&quot; celebrated, ended less than a year later.  Original DW novels are still published, but through a different publishing company, and with entirely different regular characters.  Reading this novel so many years after publication is a lot like watching an old rerun of a TV reunion special.  Hopefully, you'll be able to say that you remember all the great old moments, and this book will make you smile nostalgically, and just a little bit wistfully.<BR>But another of Cornell's themes is that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has become far more than just another TV series.  On that note, that central message of &quot;Happy Endings&quot; remains true to this day.	2002-12-02
US	51345392	R1Z7ZFYFBK16CL	0380807319	38857560	Walking the Bible: A Journey by Land Through the Five Books of Moses	Books	4	20	22	N	N	Eating the Bible	Two incidents happened as I read \\"Walking the Bible\\" which convinced me of the book's success.  First, a string of terrorist incidents in Israel and Kenya, on the U.S. Thanksgiving, which illustrated the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict that's repeatedly described in the book.  Second, while I read the chapter set in Petra, the ancient Jordanian city featured in the climactic battle of \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\", I was interrupted with the news that \\"Last Crusade\\" was on TV that very minute.  Since \\"Walking the Bible\\" is utterly devoid of pictures, I put the book down momentarily to watch the real thing for myself.<br />It was easier for Bruce Feiler to experience the many personal revelations he undergoes in \\"Walking the Bible\\".  He had remarkable company -- archaelogist Avner Goren, his walking companion for most of the book's episodes, is former chief archaeologist of the Sinai peninsula.  Feiler also interviews a bevy of other biblical archaeologists, and sits down with former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.  No typical tourist will ever receive this much direct insight into the region.<br />However, Feiler has written a great armchair journey for the rest of us.  He divides his book (of course) into five parts, matching the Five Books of Moses he seeks to recreate.  He journeys from Turkey to Mesopotamia to Israel, Egypt, the Sinai, and Jordan, reading passages from the Torah along the way to illustrate key moments in the story.  \\"Walking\\" is part travelogue, part spiritual journey, part textbook, and part recipe book.  The hunger Feiler feels in the desert is never explicitly mentioned, but the Georgia-born author must have been well and truly starving, because every three pages, a bit of timeless Biblical landscape is described in food metaphor.  These are too numerous to mention, but I will say that the most bizarre is the Israeli truck that reminds him of a box of Sweet Tarts.<br />Because Feiler does so much wandering, both geographically and emotionally, some parts of \\"Walking the Bible\\" are inevitably less enjoyable than others.  I felt that the strongest writing occurs in Jordan, at the end of the book, at the end of Moses' life.  When Feiler gets into a Biblical argument with Muslim bedouins about just who Moses was, over discrepancies between the Torah and the Koran, it becomes easier to see just why the Middle East conflict has persisted for so long.  The journey through the remnants of Petra, a city carved from sandstone cliffs, is truly awe-inspiring (again, despite the lack of pictures).  I also enjoyed his journeys to Mount Ararat, the Great Pyramid, and the Wailing Wall.<br />As to the book's brief descriptions of 20th century conflict, some readers will doubtless be offended by the appearance of a Jordanian minister (whose own words reveal him to be a narrow-minded hypocrite), or by Feiler's interviews with American-born Israelis living in the disputed territories of the West Bank.  However, in the context of the larger story -- four thousand years of history, in which little has truly changed -- I feel that these detours are necessary and well-balanced.	2002-11-29
US	51345392	RU2VVG4MNGGS7	0426203933	605906192	Birthright (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Doctorless Who and the Really Big Bugs	\\"Birthright\\" is an unusual little book.  It checks in at a bantamweight 216 pages, made up of short chapters and choppy sentences.  It was the first New Adventure to omit the Doctor entirely, apart from very brief passages at the beginning and end.  The author was Nigel Robinson, former editor of the DW novelizations range, writing his second and final NA.  It's part of a brief 2-book detour (not an arc), and yet drops lots of hints about the Doctor himself; introduces a potential recurring character; and shows the Doctor at his darkest and most manipulative.  9 years later, does \\"Birthright\\" still hold up?<br />I really enjoyed \\"Birthright\\" when it was published.  I enjoyed the way that the Doctor's fingerprints were allowed to remain all over the action, even when he was offscreen.  I enjoyed the new character Muldwych, who seems to have an intimate connection with the Doctor.  He wears the same blue Roman ring favored by the first Doctor, and much of his dialogue is recycled from the TV episodes.  I enjoyed the way the first 100 pages were anchored by new companion Benny, who in 1993 was still a novelty act.<br />This time around, however, I'm afraid that \\"Birthright\\"'s technical faults grabbed my attention more than the story.  Benny, whose character was never really firmly defined from year to year, has some horrible moments in this story -- she aids in the theft of jewelry from the person of an unconscious assault victim, and is seen to exult at the death of a foe.  While I still enjoyed the story's fast pacing, the writing style of a 216-page book feels more like an outline of a novel than a book in its own right.  Passages which should convey tension or drama feel more like Post-It notes describing what the author intends to do.  A room is described as \\"a massive chamber the size of a small church\\".  I'm not sure how that works.  Another character recognizes the \\"shape of a tall blue box\\" simply from seeing a square outline in the grass.<br />Other elementsof the book -- the Doctor's offstage manipulations, the strange motivations of Muldwych -- were interesting, tantalizing hints in 1993, but have yellowed with disuse.  Muldwych is basically a one-off character (he did have a cameo in \\"Happy Endings\\"), and it's a shame we never found out what Robinson intended for him.<br />\\"Birthright\\" remains an interesting time capsule into what \\"Doctor Who\\" looked like in print in 1993.  Unfortunately, even though all the elements for success are there, it's something less than a complete story in its own right.	2002-11-18
US	51345392	R2W8XHJYY6LIV1	0426203879	580644639	Deceit (The New Doctor Who Adventures)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	The Exception that Proves the Rule	&quot;Deceit&quot; is a pretty dull book.  It's one of the longer New Adventures, checking in at over 300 pages.  Although the book has been out for nearly a decade now, it's still more noteworthy among book fans for editor-author Peter Darvill-Evans's afterword, in which the clear directive of the NAs is spelled out to fans for the first time.  When the best thing you can say about a book relates to its afterword, usually it's time to go home...<br />However, once you get over the fact that the story is pretty standard, and that the TARDIS doesn't even make it to the planet Arcadia until page 100, and that the Doctor and his two companions are separated for the entire book until the very last minute...well, you begin to appreciate in retrospect just why the NAs were so good.<br />&quot;Deceit&quot; takes place in roughly the year 2453, three calendar years after the seminal &quot;Love &amp; War&quot;.  Within &quot;Deceit&quot;'s 300-odd pages, we see clearly the entire vision of future history, as the NA universe understands it.  All the tiny little hints and elements carefully placed during the first two years of the NA's publication, come to fruition here.  A textbook-style appendix, if you read it, makes things even more clear.  A lot of thought went into planning the NAs and turning them into a coherent universe of novels, rather than just a random set of monthly TV tie-in publications.  This is, to be honest, a stunning feat.<br />&quot;Deceit&quot;'s internal pacing is what turns the book into an also-ran.  The Doctor should ideally be the star of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, but in &quot;Deceit&quot; he doesn't have a line of dialogue until page 81.  There are no scenes told from his standpoint, and the way we see him through other characters' eyes is far from flattering.  The return of Ace, absent for the previous three books, is more disturbing than rousing.  Benny, as ever, is all over the map.  One particular supporting characters are dragged across an entire book with nothing to say, and then, when it's all over, her fate is left rather up in the air.  Yes.  Thank you.<br />But, turning again to the Darvill-Evans afterword, even here you can see that the author learned from his own mistakes, and fewer and fewer books after &quot;Deceit&quot; would make them.  &quot;Deceit&quot; may not bear re-reading, but its impact on the next 5 years of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; books was very positive indeed	2002-11-11
US	51345392	RZLTX8NPE9HTV	0426204840	878107707	So Vile a Sin (Doctor Who : The New Adventures)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	So Might Have Been	This was supposed to be the \\"It\\" novel of 1996.  The Virgin \\"Doctor Who\\" New Adventures had been given their death sentence, a victim of the US TV movie which regenerated the Doctor.  The NAs promptly adjusted by crafting together a series of novels which brought the 7th Doctor right up to death's door, while closing out the storylines and themes of 60 well-received books.  _So Vile A Sin_ had the task of writing out companion Roz Forrester and sealing the NAs' version of \\"future history\\" with an ironic little bow.<br />So what happened?  The novel died.  A victim of author Ben Aaronovitch's ambitions and the much ballyhooed \\"hard-drive crash\\" that torched the original publication date.  Four subsequent Roz-free books hit the market, and indeed the Virgin license had technically expired, by the time a restored \\"Sin\\", now written by Kate Orman, hit the shelves, sans the \\"Doctor Who\\" logo.<br />It remains to this day hard to judge just how good \\"So Vile\\" is.  Orman and Aaronovitch have vastly different styles, but they essentially write to the same purpose.  Their \\"joint\\" novel takes us to the ends of the Earth Empire in the late 30th century, from the moons of Jupiter to the planets of the distant sun Agammemnon, from the Time Lords' darkest secrets to the death of Doctor Who.  And yet, for all that travel, we barely see a thing.<br />Properly set up at 400 pages as intended, this book may indeed have been a wonderful epic.  Instead, it feels more like a string of disjointed episodes.  Many characters are introduced in a sprawling, harshly-written prologue that must have been written by Aaronovitch (drenched with military speak, cultural annotations, and a too-long history of 30th century prostitution -- \\"Doctor Who\\" was originally a kids' series).  However, the chess pieces fade in and out for hundreds of pages at a time, and their role in the grand finale is unclear until you read the book at least twice.<br />And then there's Roz.  Clearly this was meant to be herapotheosis.  The book's third and final segment shows how the honorable yet disgraced 30th century cop is torn between her sister's Imperial ambitions and Doctor's unique sense of justice (\\"You might be asked to choose sides.  Do you want my advice? Don't.\\").  We learn of her family's history, and rise to nobility.  Roz has hard decisions to make, and her exit from the series is heroic and boneheaded all at once.<br />Where's the problem?  Well... Roz *had* no character, for the 18 or so novels before this one.  News of her death was well-known to fandom, long before her first adventure belatedly hit US bookshelves.  If all of her books had been like this, her finale may have been grandly moving.  Instead, there's a bit of an \\"eh\\" to it.  Ben Aaronovitch clearly understood her better than anyone, but he only wrote for her twice.  Kate, in his place, merely ramps up some aimless sexual tension between her and the much younger Chris Cwej.  There's a very muted family tragedy that I'd completely forgotten about, again probably due to missing text.<br />Surprisingly, the psi-powers element of SVAS is well done, even as the preceding stories in the psi-powers arc were among the worst the NAs gave us.  The book's first great scene (all the way along on page 111) shows the root cause of psychic powers in the Universe, and there's a great mini-speech by the Doctor later on about how Time Lords came to be.  These are grand visual moments, what DW always did best.<br />Other things of note: old companion Bernice Summerfield's return for Roz's funeral; Roz's young 30th century clone; and the \\"alternate\\" Doctors accidentally released by the book's psi-powered bad guys, the Brotherhood.  But in the end, it's a space opera, with lots of cramped spaceships and dark tunnels and claustrophic marketplaces.  In this one instance, less was not more, and the best version of \\"So Vile A Sin\\" probably still resonates in Ben Aaronovitch's head.  Or on his computer.	2002-11-03
US	51345392	R31LAHKFKJDTGM	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	5	19	22	N	N	Flawed man, flawless book	It took me a couple of weeks to get through 650 pages of &quot;John Adams&quot;, and that's not counting the extensive footnotes and documentation.  I was riveted for every one of those pages, transported effortlessly back to the late 18th and early 19th centuries, walking in John Adams's footsteps.  What David McCullough has done (and my brain hurts to think about the years of research that must have gone into this book, even before the writing) is create a walking, talking Adams for all seasons, spanning 80 years of his life, paying as much attention to Year 9 as to year 59.<br />It helps that there hasn't been as much popular print on Adams as there has been on the other Founding Fathers (leaving aside the  scholarly works).  I've read a number of popular Revolutionary War-era books (e.g. &quot;Duel&quot;) that never managed to convince me that history happened quite that way.  McCullough recreates a nation's capital (three of them, in fact) that's eerily reminiscent of today's.  Everything new is old again.  The scheming and double-dealing in Europe is just as odious.  By the end of his lone-term Presidency, Adams was about as reviled as Jimmy Carter must have been in 1980.<br />The unbilled co-star of this book is Abigail, whose life is described in as much detail as John's.  There's also a fairly strong portrait of John Quincy Adams, who I must reluctantly admit I knew only through Anthony Hopkins's portrayal in &quot;Amistad&quot;.  Thomas Jefferson is portrayed in a more ambivalent manner, but McCullough never seems to be choosing sides and stresses that, up or down, his friendship with Adams is still one of the underpinnings of modern American government.<br />The side steps are equally good, whereas in other history books I might find myself skipping back to the main plot.  Discourses on the geography of 1770s Philadelphia, the history of the influenza epidemic, the brief glimpses at the French Revolution, are all informative without screaming &quot;I'm showing off!&quot;.<br />It all comes back to John Adams, in the end.  McCullough doesn't judge him, I feel, although the book is more sympathetic than not.  I opened to page 1 knowing very little about John Adams, and made it to page 649 with increased admiration for his role in history.  Along the way I read lots of great historical quotes, from Adams or otherwise, and obtained much stronger insights into the Constitution than I'd had before.  Today's political arena may be ugly, but Adams walked through it gracefully 200 years ago and maybe after reading about his life, we can hope that today's leaders will ultimately do the same.	2002-10-31

What I got, however, was a knee-slapper, an out-and-out comedy, by my estimation the third one of these the EDAs have put out in the last 12 months or so (along with \\"Earthworld\\" and \\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\", and that's not even counting \\"The Slow Empire\\").<br />The basic plot appears to tie in with the recent Sabbath arc.  A mysterious time-traveler comes to the 2130s to auction his machine to the highest bidder, in exchange for the defense secrets that might well spark off war between the United States and the European Union.  But the bidders include an ancient Scottish secret agent (and his sidekick \\"Penny Lik\\"), a couple of undercover agents from the future, and... time-traveling rhinoceroses, looking to inherit the secrets of Gallifrey, and wearing those silly Time Lord hat-and-collar sets from the 1970s.<br />The villain here, Baskerville (there are no mention of his hounds) is a charming, over the top gangster reminiscent of Gert Frobe or Robert Davi.  His rantings on politics are so surreal that one almost suspects Parkin believes them.  There's an awful lot of second-unit photography -- locales include Athens, Toronto, Los Angeles, and Ibiza.  The paragraph on page 8 describing the retro-1990s cafe is probably the funniest paragraph ever to appear in \\"Doctor Who\\", but I can't reprint it here.<br />Bottom line, \\"Trading Futures\\" is a fast, funny book, with small flashes of sincerity and an awful lot of irony.  Three different characters die seconds after proclaiming that bullets can't harm them.  If you were expecting a hard espionage thriller right out of Robert Ludlum... be thankful you were wrong.	2002-10-29

You also probably know that he looks to be one of the most brilliant talents churned out by the decade-old \\"Doctor Who\\" books series.  Here's a guy who can tie together complicated sci-fi concepts, air-tight plotting, and nifty characterizations, all without breaking a sweat.  After one chapter of \\"Anachrophobia\\" I was looking to petition Amazon.com to allow me to give this book 6 stars.<br />Then, I hit the rest of the book.<br />Make no mistake, \\"Anachrophobia\\" has a brilliant setup.  The early scenery is crisp: a planet stuck in time on a winter's night in a leafless forest.  The story background is Douglas Adams funny: a plutocratic empire wages war against a ragtag team of loan defaulters.  And there's real horror, as characters are killed not by bullets, but by accelerated (or decelerated) bursts of time itself.<br />What bogs the book down is the lack of that something Extra.  Maybe I was waiting too long for the book to tie back into the arc-changing events of \\"The Adventuress of Henrietta Street\\" a few books back.  After the clock villains arrive... they simply lumber around for 150 pages, and become less menacing with each attack.  It takes forever for the action to get out of the tiny underground bunker and back into the forest (or elsewhere).  A character arrives on page 100 who's so obviously a decoy that I found myself skipping ahead (unsuccessfully) to the final pages in search of the name of the character he simply had to be.<br />When the climax finally arrives, the book returns to brilliance.  The sequence in which the Doctor is offered a chance to reshape his own past is of high TV-quality (I'd love to see this filmed).  However, the Big Revelation is saved for literally the final three pages, and I'm afraid I was left scratching my head more than I was picking myself up off the floor.  Raising more questions than you answer is a good thing... but this one basically negates the entire book and, while it's not a cheat, I thought it could have been revealed 20 pages earlier.<br />In the final analysis, \\"Anachrophobia\\" continues the vast upward trend of the 8th Doctor books since the recent story arc began.  Editor Justin Richards gets massive credit for his ability to link each of the books together, through well-placed references to the past 2 or 3 adventures.  The events of \\"Adventuress\\" have paid off immediate dividends, unlike earlier EDA arcs which never  quite managed to create cliffhanger tension from book to book.  Add this to Morris's crisp writing and brilliant ideas (the Doctor's quote on pg 136 is possibly the funniest thing he's ever said) and you still have one of the best EDAs yet produced.	2002-10-27
US	51345392	RFZFPID03EMZI	0563538465	966099668	Hope (Doctor Who)	Books	3	0	0	N	Y	Rope-a-Dope	A TV critic, once writing about one of Rod Serling's lesser \\"Twilight Zone\\" scripts, noted that the episode had just two kinds of characters:  those who made speeches, and those who made speeches while shouting.<br />Welcome to \\"Hope\\".<br />\\"Hope\\" is very much in the \\"Parallel 59\\"  style of \\"Doctor Who\\" drab.  It's set in the far, far future, on a perpetually overcast planet divided into remote, fortress-like cities.  The military and the poor coexist uneasily.  There's a lot of bar-fight violence (casinos still exist in the far, far future) and two headless bodies in the first 30 pages.  Some characters make speeches.  Other characters make speeches while shouting.  The Doctor makes speeches.  The Doctor also makes speeches while shouting.  You get the drift, I think.<br />The plotting is also all over the place -- first it's a murder mystery, then it's a story about a war between the citizens of \\"Hope\\" and the out-of-time Earth scientists (with names like Stephen and Castillo, in the far, far future).  Then it becomes a 1960s-style Marvel Comics adventure.  Really, if you boil all the plots down to their essence, this is a character study about a cyborg named Silver.  Mentally reference him as the Captain from \\"The Pirate Planet\\", and he works quite well.  It really feels as if Stan Lee wrote the final chapters.  \\"Remember, kids, absolute power corrupts... absolutely!\\".  The villain is dispatched bloodlessly, and the surviving Hopesters gaze hopefully (ha!) into the morning sunrise.<br />Clapham writes a good potboiler here.  There are some heavy continuity references to the Doctor's recent physical trauma, and a very portentous dream which feels as if the editor literally threw that page into the presses as the book was entering its first print run.  The human element -- Anji's continuing pining over her long-since-departed boyfriend -- gives this book a little bit of flavor, and as far as run-of-the-mill DW novels go, this one is very tolerable.	2002-10-26

It doesn't happen very often, especially if the reader is over the age of, say, eight.  Thanks to \\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\", you too can witness the impossible, if you happen to share your commute with a \\"Doctor Who\\" fan.  I have to admit that one of the reasons I read this book in a ridiculously fast three days was so I could minimize the amount of time people would see me, an attorney at law, reading a bright pink novel with a pink, cigarette-smoking and pistol-packing poodle, on the cover.<br />For all that, is it any good?<br />\\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\", even though it's the next book in the series after the intense, moody, arc-changing \\"Adventuress of Henrietta Street\\", is lighter than air and less serious than a Leslie Nielsen movie.  At one point I tried to keep track of notable lines, but quickly ran out of room.  The whole thing's a broad satire of the sci-fi fandom culture -- broad riffs on J.R.R. Tolkien, George Lucas, and Ray Harryhausen dominate the book.  Noel Coward's also in it.  Several times.  The book jumps breezily from 1942 London to 1960 Las Vegas to 1978 Los Angeles to Outer Space, and more than gets away with it.<br />Now, this book is by Paul Magrs, one of the more divisive \\"Doctor Who\\" novel writers.  Most of his books are parodies, not satires (there's a fine line) of \\"Doctor Who\\", and revolve around his own pet character Iris Wildthyme.  Not so this book -- in fact, the word \\"Wildthyme\\" doesn't appear anywhere within its four corners.  Yes, there are the broad pokes at DW stories (the Doctor's descriptions of some of his 1970s TV adventures are drop-dead funny), but this time, Magrs doesn't seem to be trying to show off his Immense Literary Cleverness to the audience.  Like I said, it's the broadest and lightest of his books to date and I think even those readers dead set against him, will at the worst be only slightly amused.<br />And, even though it's light on the arc (the Doctor does still have his goatee), it's the second \\"fake history\\" novel in a row -- referring to all sorts of Earth events that, well, never happened.  Something very odd is happening with time -- if not necessarily with Wildthyme -- in the 8th Doctor's universe...	2002-10-24

And I suspect that subset of fans is increasingly shrinking, siphoned off by the lack of availability of the books in the USA, and by the burgeoning audio series.<br />&quot;The Adventuress of Henrietta Street&quot; is a twisting, gory work of non-fiction.  A lot has happened to the Doctor's universe in the books over the past couple of years -- most notably the erasal of Gallifrey and the Time Lords from all of history.  &quot;Henrietta&quot; is the first book to try and pick up the pieces and sort out what the books' universe looks like now.  It's done in the style of a Z-grade history book (hundreds of passages read similar to: &quot;As the Doctor looked out over the ridge that day, he must have thought about...&quot;) and concerns the Doctor's one unsuccessful year as the proprietor of a London bordello.  Obviously there's not a huge market for this sort of thing.  Of the reported 20,000 people who initially set out to buy original DW fiction, how many of them will find this concept worthy?  900?<br />That said, once you buy into the central premise, &quot;Henrietta&quot; is truly awesome.  A lot of significant events happen within the book's mythology.  The name Lawrence Miles on the spine helps:  whenever a massive arc shift occurs in the DW universe, it's done most interestingly when Miles is the author (see &quot;Alien Bodies&quot; and &quot;Interference&quot;).  Miles weaves his mentally tortured ideas into a coherent whole, and leaves you wanting a lot more.  One fun game is to count all the phony historical events that the book's anonymous narrator records so faithfully: Earth history as we know it has been radically altered since &quot;The Ancestor Cell&quot; and when you read here just how some of those events changed, you'll be quite amused (George Washington a ranting warlock, indeed!).<br />But there's another problem with any Miles-led story arc: the DW books come out monthly, but are written six months in advance.  It takes a long time for the concepts Miles works with so deftly, to permeate the other novels -- witness the 18-month vacation of Faction Paradox after &quot;Alien Bodies&quot; was published.  I fear a whole lot of confusion in the books ahead, until the other writers figure out just who Sabbath is -- that is, if he makes a return appearance at all!<br />As the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; books universe becomes a smaller and more confusing place, &quot;The Adventuress of Henrietta Street&quot; is one of its brighter corners.  This book is well worth the effort.	2002-10-23
US	51345392	R4QSINSWKE3PF	0563538414	916680421	Grimm Reality (Doctor Who)	Books	1	2	4	N	N	The Death of Doctor Who	It was an omen that this book was initially released in North America without page 146.  When those misprints flooded bookstores in 2001, my initial reaction was to buy anyway... having read Simon Bucher-Jones previous offerings (and knowing not thing one about Kelly Hale), I assumed I wouldn't understand page 146 even if I had it.<br />Well, I waited, and I finally bought _Grimm Reality_.  Almost as if ashamed to be part of the same line as all the other BBC novels, this book is unique in that there's no thumbnail reprint of the cover illustration on the spine.  Page 146 is here, now, although it doesn't add all that much.<br />I will admit defeat here.  _Grimm Reality_ is the first original \\"Doctor Who\\" novel (not counting _The Paradise of Death_) which I simply and utterly could not finish.  My bookmark indicates that I gave up at around page 200-201, and that was six months ago.<br />Why didn't I finish?  The style, for one.  I think it's easy to tell which author wrote which segments of the book, for one, if Bucher-Jones's past style is anything to go by.  My guess is that  Grimm, the jokey fairy-tale segments -- those featuring Anji and Fitz -- are by newcomer Hale.  The rest -- Reality -- is by Bucher-Jones, whose previous works _The Death of Art_ and _The Taking of Planet 5_ were muddled, unenjoyable messes.<br />Name-calling is one thing, but there's literally nothing I enjoy about this style of prose.  The book's drive is set aside for pages at a time as the author devotes hundreds of words to describing technobabbly conundrums that don't exist.  Sample sentences: \\"Candles the size of an albino blacksmith's arms in the cups of great candelabra as distant as the moon\\".  \\"A ship the size of a city ploughing across a black, burned continent, records and images from shattered memory banks falling like microscopic confetti into the receiving earth.\\"  There's just not a whole lot of *book* in all this.  Reading chapters comprised of sentences like the above really does nothing for me at all.<br />The Grimm half the book had some amusing moments.  Turning the Jackson Five into ugly fairy-tale stepsisters might be a questionable notion (and maybe only in lightly-edited TV tie-in novels could such an idea bear fruit) but those sections are faintly amusing.  Some of the fractured Grimm notions, such as the house that eats the travelers who spend the night, to \\"feed the pot\\", work well -- in this particular instance because one of the regulars is allowed a nice, human character moment.  A rarity in the book as a whole.<br />On the whole, I found no impetus to finish _Grimm Reality_.  Judging by the below reviews I may have been the only one who felt this way.  But my reading time is precious and this is never how I want to spend it.	2002-10-05

The two things you need to know before you buy &quot;Veeck -- As In Wreck&quot; -- and you will buy this book, you must, if you've ever bought any professional sports bio before -- are the names Veeck and Linn.<br />Bill Veeck you know from reputation -- the wacky promoter who invented everything from Ladies' Day to Disco Demolition Night.  The man owned several baseball franchises (including the Chicago White Sox twice, for some reason), and was known as a both a promotional genius and a shrewd financier.<br />As for Ed Linn... well, Linn was also the ghostwriter for another fantastic, edgy, opinionated baseball book, Leo Durocher's &quot;Nice Guys Finish Last&quot;.  Not surprisingly, &quot;Veeck&quot; reads a lot like the Durocher tome (and it came first, too!).  On every page here you'll find a funny anecdote, a scary bit of prescience, and a unique look at an otherwise-beloved icon.  With Veeck's memory and Linn's acid pen, this book is quite hard to put down.  Or to pick up, for that matter.<br />Sports bios tend to hold back these days, let's face it.  They're not as long and not as insightful as the Linn books.  And the gift of time has helped ripen these pages.  When Veeck talks about baseball's financial need to institute interleague play -- writing from 1961 -- you know this man saw around a few decades' worth of corners.  When he takes the Yankees to task for failing to capitalize on Roger Maris's pursuit of the Babe Ruth home run record, and notes that it was a once-in-a-lifetime event, he's right -- so baseball got it right in '98, when McGwire came to town, and when the record fell yet again in '01, hardly anyone noticed.<br />In the meantime you'll laugh at the sad fates of Bobo Holloman and Frank Saucier, the latter being the only ballplayer ever to be removed from a game for a midget.  You'll be intrigued by Veeck's take on Larry Doby, and by his bitter retorts at Del Webb, then-owner of the hated behemoth Yankees.  And you'll marvel at just how little has really changed in baseball since Veeck was retired.  Owners plotting franchise shifts in shady back-room deals (Montreal, Florida.  Florida, Boston).  Owners doing everything to baseball except what really benefits the sport (It's a tie in Milwaukee!).  Veeck lamenting not the high price of talent but rather the high price of mediocrity (how much is Colorado paying for Denny Neagle and Mike Hampton?)...<br />Just about the only highlight not covered is the sight of White Sox outfielder Chet Lemon wearing shorts.  One of the few Bill Veeck innovations that did not catch on, and aren't we all better off...	2002-09-18

My experience with boating is basically limited to... that ferry ride,... I certainly cannot review \\"Alone\\" on any sort of technical level.  I just know that it's the ideal escape fantasy.  Here Slocum travels the world on his own terms, emphasizing all the pleasures of reading on an empty sea by day, while making the difficult parts (the storms, the pirates) seem like amusing diversions.<br />The leaden 19th century prose is probably the biggest obstacle to enjoying the book.  A narrative of the same journey written today would be far more action-oriented.  However, the reader can fill in the parts that Slocum makes seem harmless -- the illnesses, the fear of sudden death, the near madness after 70 days alone on the Pacific -- for a truer taste of just how harrowing the voyage must really have been.  And then there's always the pleasure of dining with island governors, and the hobnobbing with celebrity (Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson has a large role), and unintentional amusement as Slocum describes, and bypasses, the island where a recent series of \\"Survivor\\" was filmed.<br />  When the nautical urge strikes me, this is the book I read.	2002-09-02
US	51345392	R1NECX267XALHR	0864425066	990478132	Drive Thru America	Books	4	2	2	N	N	It's funny, because it's true?	This book was recommended to me with the notion that it was about two Australians who loved American pop culture so much that they decided to drive through the United States themselves and see what it was all about.  Well, that's exactly what \\"Drive Through America\\" is... a long \\"Simpsons\\" episode in which much wackiness ensues and in which, surprisingly, there are a couple of unexpectedly emotional encounters.<br />Author Condon claims to have quit his advertising job in early 1996, and to have used the ensuing free time to drive from New York to San Francisco the long way around.  Along for the ride is friend O'Brien, who provides the illustrations and plays the laconic sidekick.  Weird things happen to the pair: their rental car is struck by lightning, they travel to the deep South to return a lost bible found on a New York City subway train, and they have a gun-toting encounter on a Hollywood movie shoot.<br />How much of this actually happened is, of course, debatable.  For a hint of what the drive through America was really like, check out the acknowledgements, which paint a different picture as to where they stayed and what they saw.  So, fine, this is not a straight travelogue but mostly an extended riff on what it's like to walk into the land of all those TV sitcoms and classic movies.  The pop culture jokes are all over the place, some of them quite subtle: the \\"Clockwork Orange\\" gag (relating to the serial theft of hotel TV remote controls) may have been the best part of the book for me.  There's also just a smidgen of social commentary (why does Condon, in the USA, feel he has to buy a gun?).<br />For the most part, the jokes and the exaggerated episodes are enough to make \\"Drive Through America\\" a fast, fun read.  Perhaps after this you'll want to rent your own car, find your own wise, quiet sidekick, and do it all again on your own.	2002-08-29
US	51345392	R69HBL923MT4	0812930991	150767402	Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative	Books	4	16	26	N	N	Connecting the Dots	I spent most of the early-to-mid '90s as a college student somewhere near Washington, D.C., and had far too many friends active in the College Republicans.  I remember hearing many of the scandalous assertions against Bill Clinton, repeated wholesale by op-ed writers in the campus newspaper.  Even though I voted for Clinton twice, I remember suffering from \\"Clinton Fatigue\\" by the time 1997 rolled around.  I remember waking up early on a Saturday morning to watch Bob Livingston resign as Speaker of the House on C-SPAN, and remember feeling relieved when the Republican-controlled Senate acquitted him at the end of the impeachment trial.  And I remember David Brock's name surfacing at various points along the way.<br />\\"Blinded by the Right\\" is a remarkable work, although perhaps not in the way Brock intended.  It connects the dots in the infamous \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\", a shadowy sort of far-right cabal that engineered President Clinton's would-be downfall.  At the same time Brock attempts to repudiate his \\"investigative journalism\\" of a decade ago -- his trashing of Anita Hill, the discovery of the Arkansas State Troopers who may have solicited dates for the President, and his career-breaking effort to find dirt on Hillary Clinton.  The first of these books, the history, is a fascinating read.  The second, the biography, is exhausting.<br />As a former member of the far right, Brock is able to describe the incestuous financial connections that linked Capital Hill Republicans to the '90s sort of gonzo journalism that hounded the President.  He describes reprehensible actions taken by those who are still in power, and undercuts nearly every conservative pundit or op-ed writer who still spews against the \\"liberals\\" today.  At the same time that Brock paints a nasty picture of Ann Coulter, you can turn to the New York Times Book Review and see that Ms. Coulter has authored the best-selling non-fiction book in the US, and it's about \\"Slander\\" and \\"liberal lies\\".  He even manages to tie in the Rev. Tim LaHaye, creator of the \\"Left Behind\\" series (the latest installment of which is currently the best-selling fiction book in the US), to the conspiracy.  There's even a Tom Wolfe cameo.  Just who dominates the media, anyway?  The right has been waging a culture war for over a decade, and Brock shows just how the conservative intelligentsia won a chess game that they played uncontested.<br />What drags down \\"Blinded by the Right\\" is Brock?s repetitive apologia.  Every few paragraphs are punctuated by Joyceian epiphanies (?Only then did I begin to allow myself to see ...?).  Factor in the author?s own retraction of his earlier works, and then the reader begins to wonder how much of \\"Blinded\\" is real, and how much is vendetta.  But even if you discount a good portion of what Brock writes, the objective facts speak for themselves.  Brock may feel a little better about his conscience now, but many others have a lot to be depressed about...	2002-07-22

It's been thirty years, now, since the thwarted break-in at the Watergate.  Most of the higher-ups in President Nixon's administration have passed away, and subsequent generations reared on Iran-Contra and Whitewater may not even remember what the fuss was about.  But from the very first page of this book, history becomes life and events rush forward to the inevitable conclusion that still seems impossible today.<br />Woodward and Bernstein's reporting is the major thrust of the first half of &quot;President's&quot;.  We watch both reporters work late into the night, interviewing reluctant and/or anonymous witnesses in an attempt to find out just why the Watergate burglars had connections with the White House, and how far up the political chain of command those men were connected.  Along the way, mistakes are made and a reputations are wrongfully derailed.  But the story -- the crimes and the subsequent cover-ups may have indeed been directed by the President of the United States himself! -- takes on a life of its own, and Woodward and Bernstein become witness to the defining story of an era.<br />Much of &quot;All the President's Men&quot; has passed into legend, especially the unrevealed identity of Woodward's executive branch contact known only as &quot;Deep Throat&quot;.  The Watergate players to this day still debate just who Deep Throat was -- John Dean seems to publish a book on the subject every five years.  Time has proven most of the accusations correct -- for an interesting exercise, try comparing Woodward's and Bernstein's discoveries with the corresponding daily entries in &quot;The Haldeman Diaries&quot;).    The book gives so few clues as to make the exercise nearly impossible, even to those of us who've read all there is to read about Watergate and Nixon.  Was it John Dean?  Alexander Haig?  Perpetual Nixon apologist Bill Safire?  The answer will be made known in my lifetime, butI would like to think sooner rather than later.<br />Although 30 years is a short time in American history, in politics it can be a lifetime.  The meticulous triple and quadruple-checking of the Washington Post staff has given way to the unfounded accusations that support a half-dozen instant political bestsellers.  Certainly no-one uses the passive voice quite as monotonously as do Woodward and Bernstein.  These defects, however, are minor: the antics of Colson and Liddy and Haldeman and even the amusing capers of Donald Segretti remain fascinating in print even today.<br />When you're done with &quot;All the President's Men&quot;, I recommend &quot;The Final Days&quot; (by Woodward and Bernstein) and &quot;The Haldeman Diaries&quot;, and then the rebuttal books put out by Nixon staffers such as Haig and Erlichman.	2002-07-15

He may not be very deep, but he's quite, quite broad.  Nearly every King book approaches publishing from a different angle, whether that be novel, book of interconnected novellas, two simultaenously-published books with the same plot (one written by pseudonym), or book of short stories.  This latest short story collection showcases King's talents at nearly every type of story, and nearly every one is excellent.<br />The collection opens with a pair of homages.  \\"Autopsy Room Four\\" is an update of an episode \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\\", and it's a comic chiller.  On the first page of this collection you're already introduced to a living protagonist wrapped in a body bag.  A great start!  The second homage, \\"The Man in the Black Suit\\", is more philosophical, derived from a Nathaniel Hawthorne story.  I find this one less successful, if only because King's take on the Devil is his usual foul-mouthed villain, forced to utter lines such as \\"Biiig Fiiish!\\".  Where's the subtlety?<br />The next two stories are \\"mainstream\\", devoid of the supernatural.  \\"All That You Love Will Be Carried Away\\" marries a collection of men's-room graffiti to the last hours of a traveling salesman.  This one tries for pathos, and almost makes it.  More affecting, I found, was \\"The Death of Jack Hamilton\\", a Depression-era period piece starring John Dillinger and narrated by a dim-witted sidekick.<br />\\"In the Deathroom\\" is the first of three stories previously presented on the \\"Blood & Smoke\\" audio release.  It's about an American journalist accused of espionage and tortured in South America.  Perhaps coming so close after the murder of Daniel Pearl this story strikes a little too close to the wrong nerves, but the writing is first-rate.  \\"Lunch at the Gotham Cafe\\" is another comic nightmare, set in New York City's Upper East Side, pitting an insane maitre'd against the most acrimonious divorce of all time.  Who wins?  \\"1408\\"is the scariest story in the book, perhaps even an improvement on \\"The Shining\\".  There's a great extended dialogue scene between a horror writer and a stodgy NYC innkeeper, and a horrific \\"Blair Witch\\"-style mental breakdown captured on audiotape.<br />\\"The Little Sisters of Eluria\\" introduced me to the world of the Dark Tower, with which I wasn't familiar.  I enjoyed the novella and went out and purchased \\"The Gunslinger\\" immediately after.  I can't judge the story as an effective Dark Tower tale, but I liked the mix of Old West and dark fantasy (blue jeans and vampires), and the stilted dialogue of the hero that almost seems written for Kevin Costner.<br />\\"Everything's Eventual\\" is both the title story and the gem of the collection, a brilliant narrative that takes at least two sharp unexpected turns between comedy and sci-fi horror.  Well, well worth a couple of reads.  \\"L.T.'s Theory of Pets\\" walks the same line, although I'm not sure if those without pets will see it the same way.<br />\\"The Road Virus Heads North\\" is the weakest story in the collection, mainly due to a complete lack of logic as the story races to its conclusion.  It's about a haunted painting which stalks a Stephen King-style writer up the Maine coast.  Help yourself.<br />The book ends with the previously-unread-on-e-book \\"Riding the Bullet\\", a good effort about a young man's choice between life and death while hitching a ride from a dead man, and then with King's version of a light palette-cleanser, \\"Luckey Quarter\\", a short-short that improves on the second and third readings.<br />There's something for everyone in \\"Everything's Eventual\\", from mainstream to horror to slapstick comedy, to Stephen King's patented mix of all three.  The stories are best read over a period of time -- I read them all in a row, and my night's sleep got progressively shorter by the end, most notably after \\"1408\\".  And now, on to \\"The Gunslinger\\".	2002-06-25

On October 3rd, he broadcast the official recreation of the 1951 Miracle at Coogan's Bluff game for Major League Baseball's official website; later on, he broadcast the final game of a World Series for an all-time-greats fantasy league also run by MLB.  Not bad, for a man who was fired by his longtime Detroit Tigers employees over a decade ago for being &quot;too old&quot;.<br />&quot;My 60 Years in Baseball&quot; has a very unusual title for an autobiography.  That's because it's not an autobiography -- it's a standard bio, written by columnist Tom Keegan.  Presumably this was done with Ernie Harwell's full cooperation, and reprints of several Harwell newspaper columns highlight the book.  I'm just a little confused by the use of the word &quot;My&quot;.<br />I know Tom Keegan's columns from the New York Post, and &quot;My 60 Years&quot; reads very much like a 275-page human interest story.  It's a puff piece, but in the best way possible.  Keegan tracks down interviews with athletes, writers and friends who have known Harwell at various points along his 60-plus-year career, and the stories related are mostly heart-warming.  The best chapter in the book is an interview with Denny McLain, one-time Tiger pitching ace, from his cell in federal prison.  Even repeat convicts love the voice of Ernie Harwell.<br />Don't read &quot;Ernie Harwell&quot; because it's the best sports bio of all time, but read it to become more familiar with one of the last of the original (and now &quot;old school&quot;) announcers.  I listened to Ernie for the brief time I lived in the Detroit metro area, and I'm glad I had the chance.  It's a specific style of broadcast, heavy on imagery and game detail, that's no longer in vogue and will be dearly missed when the last of its practictioners hangs up their microphones.  Read the stories Keegan finds, and read again the reprinted Harwell columns, which are a delight of word choice, firm opinion, and humor.	2002-06-02
US	51345392	R20DLY9XYFRU3N	0805063897	671016982	Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America	Books	4	21	27	N	N	All in all it's just another brick in the Wal-Mart	Last week I read an editorial by would-be Secretary of Labor Linda Chavez, extolling the virtues of Congress's 1996 welfare reform bill.  Chavez's column was a glowing tribute to her own naivete, talking about how the \\"welfare rolls\\" had been \\"cut in half\\", as if that were an end in itself.  Not discussed was the fate of those cast off the rolls.  How is the free job market treating them?  Do they earn well?  Are they learning job skills?  Do they have health benefits?  Are they better off today than they were five years ago?<br />Barbara Ehrenreich's \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" nearly answers the above questions, and the answers are all \\"No!\\".  Ehrenreich enters the private sector and takes on the low-wage jobs that mothers newly off welfare can expect to find: waitressing, cleaning, and retail.  The jobs are found in different areas of the country, rural or urban, diverse or all white, but the results are the same across the board:  low-wage workers have nothing on their side except their own optimism.<br />One can quibble with Ehrenreich's methodology, or with her politics, or her work ethic, or with the way she chooses to write this book (the frank admission of marijuana use seems rather pathetic in this context).  However, I don't quibble with the results.  Before entering the professional world I logged time in the retail industry, and certainly the chapter on being a \\"sales associate\\" at Wal-Mart struck several chords with me all at once.  As Ehrenreich reports, so it is:  the pointless staff meetings, the ban on talking to co-workers, the strictly monitored break policy and, worst of all, the corporate videos telling you, \\"It's a great place to work!\\".  Except for the hourly wage, meager health benefits, and lack of opportunity for career advancement -- not to mention the strikes against the worker trying to raise children or eat well.<br />All together, \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" raises far more questions than there are answers.  Ehrenreich quotes several meaningful numbersin her final chapter, but alas the book can only conclude with a paragraph that sounds like \\"Workers of the world may again unite\\".  At best, I enjoyed this book for its undercover reporting, for its portrayal of retail and management -- pay particular attention to Ted, the cleaning-franchise owner, who could carry a whole novel on his own.  While Ehrenreich might not have made a better Secretary of Labor than Linda Chavez, she's certainly better at spotting the issues.	2002-05-14

Any walk of a mile or longer invariably brought up memories of the deadly Long Walk taken by a hundred fictional teenagers in the alternate-history Earth of this early King classic.<br />As other reviewers have noted, just to read this book is to feel physically tired.  The characters start walking, at a grueling pace of four miles per hour, early in the first chapter, and never stop.  There are only two ways out of the contest: death or victory... and, out of the 100 contestants, there can only be one winner.  \\"The Long Walk\\" takes place over five days in May, and by the final day, the Prize may no longer seem worth winning.<br />As painful as your legs will feel by the final chapter, you'll be equally intrigued by the little alternate-history hints King drops throughout the book.  With references to John Travolta and the handover of the Panama Canal, \\"Long Walk\\" is still very much a product of the 1970s.  But when the characters mention \\"April 31st\\", or New Hampshire's provisional governor, or the German bombing raids over the East Coast in World War II, you'll find yourself wondering just how the world of the \\"Long Walk\\" came to be.  Most intriguing is a fictional quote from the \\"second Clay-Liston\\" fight, which ends even worse for Sonny Liston than did the actual Ali-Liston fight in our own 1965.<br />The only thing that disrupts \\"The Long Walk\\" is the ambiguous final page.  King points out in the introduction to this edition that his Bachman persona did not specialize in happy endings, and of course we know that King writes insanity quite convincingly.  I've beem vaguely dissatisfied with the ending after both my readings -- but, taken by itself, the final line is still a creepy finale to a very creepy book...	2002-05-11

Novels which are narrated by male characters are instant classics, books to be read a hundred times and enjoyed letter by letter.  Novels from the POV of female characters are excellent -- but just not quite as memorable.<br />My introduction to Anne Tyler came with &quot;Accidental Tourist&quot;, and since then I rate &quot;Saint Maybe&quot; and &quot;A Patchwork Planet&quot; as two of my favorite books of all time.  Tyler gets inside the heads of her male characters with alarming humor and accuracy.  I am less fond of the women of &quot;Ladder of Years&quot; and &quot;Breathing Lessons&quot; -- and now, of &quot;Back When We Were Grownups&quot; -- although I still rate them as fine books.  Perhaps, as a guy, I just can't bring enough to the table to appreciate the insights and sentiments.<br />&quot;Grownups&quot; is a bit predictable, as if it followed the same chapter outline as Tyler's last six or seven books.  There they are, in all the expected places:  Rebecca, the main character who feels she hasn't become the person she always wanted to be; the annoying extended family, with bizarre names (NoNo, Biddy, and Patch -- who for good measure marries a man named Jeep); Rebecca's reluctant relationship with her off-kilter ex-boyfriend; the reluctant parting of ways late in the day; and then finally Rebecca's inevitable acceptance of just who she is, warts and all.<br />Rebecca's a memorable character, and so are some of the other Davitch family members (especially Poppy, the centegenarian uncle).  But my greatest sympathies lay with Will, Rebecca's once and future boyfriend, the insular college professor with the troubled daughter and the completely astray domestic life.  There was a time when this book could have been about Will (and it was &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot;).  Instead, Will comes and goes, sometimes funny and sometimes poignant, and at the end of the day I almost wished the book had been about him, instead.	2002-05-07

This debut novel is by Lloyd Rose, whose pre-DW resume includes an episode of \\"Homicide: Life on the Streets\\", one of the most highly-regarded US TV series of the past decade.  Any writer with that sort of credit (even if that episode was from the show's waning final season) deserves a shot at improving the DW universe.  Rose takes the ball and runs so far with it, you'd think she played running back for the New Orleans Saints.<br />The story is a New Orleans murder mystery, and of course one of the leads is a homicide detective.  However, to the book's credit, he's a thoroughly original character, and not a thinly-disguised Andre Braugher or Richard Belzer.  The biggest revelation is that magic is real, here.  Yes, there has been magic in DW stories before -- demons, spells, even lousy scientific techno-babble explanations.  But \\"City\\" essentially reinvents the wheel:  for the first half of the book, characters talk about magic, but we never see evidence that it's real.  You can believe the book isn't even science fiction.  Then, the floodgates open, and Rose separates the pretenders (the \\"wanna-blessed-be's\\", as they were one called on Buffy, a show which obviously influences this novel a great deal) from the powerful mages.  An effective setup creates a more intense finale than usual.<br />The Doctor is the triumph of this book, of this year, of the entire BBC Eight Doctor series.  Finally, an author gets so deftly inside his head that she singlehandedly puts the print Doctor right up there with all his living, breathing TV counterparts.  This Doctor thinks, worries, misses the point: doesn't know the difference between Creole and Cajun, and finds menace in a salt-shaker (this last bit perhaps the funniest meta-reference in any \\"Doctor Who\\" format).  Anji, dating again, and Fitz, more than ever like XanderHarris, are equally well-portrayed, but unfortunately vanish over the final third of the book.<br />The last chapter is a special-effects light show, with revelation poured upon revelation and honestly, after one insufficient read, a bit of a muddle.  I'm sure it all makes sense -- indeed the rest of this book was so strong that I'll just take the ending on faith.  Meanwhile, it's a sure bet that Rose's next \\"Doctor Who\\" book will be better than this one, an eleven out of ten.	2002-05-03

He's currently in his fifth different decade of service with the Amazin's, first as star player and now as broadcaster.  In this latter role he's gained a reputation as part All-Star analyst and part bore.  This 1970 \\"autobiography\\", part of the Dick Schaap franchise (and Schaap admitted it was his least favorite book) showcases both analyst and bore, often at the same time.<br />\\"The Perfect Game\\" is not about a perfect game, but rather about Game 4 of the 1969 World Series, an extra-innings affair pitched and won by Seaver, which set up the Mets' championship-clinching victory over the overmatched Baltimore Orioles the next day.  Seaver was just 25 when the game was played, and in just his third Major League season.  There's not a whole lot of biography in here, and so the book is told in alternating sections, both life story, and pitch-by-pitch account of that ballgame.  As a baseball fan interested in how pitch sequences are plotted, and how the separate players work as a team on the field to execute plays, and how you strike out Hall-of-Fame slugger Frank Robinson, you will enjoy this book.  Even better, the \\"flashbacks\\" are separated by an extra-wide left-hand margin, so they read twice as fast.<br />The best passages in \\"Perfect Game\\" are those about Gil Hodges, Mets manager and, like Seaver, represented by one of the few retired numbers in left field at Shea Stadium.  We learn how Hodges managed his young ballclub to a 100-victory season, against 100 to 1 odds.  He did it by demanding constant attention to detail, and with shrewd personnel management.  His old-school advice (telling the young Seaver that laughing on the mound was \\"unprofessional\\") could be seen as a breath of fresh air in today's ESPN-ized sports atmosphere.  It's a considerable loss that Hodges did not get to issue an autobiography ofhis own.	2002-04-30

Twenty years ago this week, I went to my first-ever baseball game, at Shea Stadium.  I broke away from the Yankee-rooting faith of my dad, and have been a Mets fan for twenty years.  Buying this book was a no-brainer.  While I don't regret the purchase, I do wish I'd had a chance to edit this book before it was bound and sold to others!<br />Peter Golenbock has written oral history before, most notably about the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Casey Stengel Yankees.  This is good because it enables Golenbock to mail in the first hundred pages of this new book, a lengthy recap of those two earlier ones.  The history of New York City baseball is traced slowly, from 1880 through 1960, as we revisit scenes from &quot;Bums&quot; and reread profiles on Stengel and first Mets General Manager George Weiss from &quot;Dynasty&quot;.<br />Golenbock's strength in those earlier books wasn't so much his descriptions of individual games as it was the ability to draw detailed memories and strong quotes from players and fans.  In &quot;Amazin'&quot;, we read lengthy passages from a lot of memorable names in Mets history:  the first three players interviewed are Rod Kanehl, Ron Hunt, and Ron Swoboda (and later on, we meet Ron Gardenhire.  A pattern?).  Al Leiter is the only post-1990 Met interviewed, and 66 of the book's final 67 passages are from him.  Al's a terrific storyteller and I'd love to read his biography one day.<br />Other interviews are more suspect.  That's because Golenbock simply reprints pages from the earlier autobiographies of Doc Gooden, Darryl Strawberry, and Lenny Dykstra.  Strawberry's ghost-writer employed particularly dramatic prose, so Darryl's quotes stick out dramatically from all the other conversational recollections.<br />Many minor facts in this book are flatly incorrect, from the misnaming of Tom Seaver to the descriptions of Game 6 of the 1999 playoff series against the Braves.  Golenbock describes the game one way, and then is contradicted by Leiter.  Thishappens frequently throughout the book.  Also odd is that Bob Murphy, the first voice ever heard broadcasting a Mets game on radio, and now in his 41st year of service, is mentioned exactly twice in the book.  Also mentioned exactly twice is Michael Kay, a Yankee broadcaster for 11 years and never an employee of the Mets.  Where's the Murph?  Also omitted is the furore over the 1992 trade of David Cone, although this is perhaps the only omission of a major turning point in Met fortunes throughout the book's 625-page length.<br />You can learn a lot about Mets history from &quot;Amazin'&quot;, particularly from the chapter on Bill Shea, and from the chapters on the recent Bobby Valentine years, the first such chapters written about the current team.  On these levels, &quot;Amazin'&quot; is groundbreaking.  On other levels, it seems rushed: the book ends abruptly with Leiter discussing the final out of the 2000 World Series, and there's no author afterword or conclusion.	2002-04-21

The mutant baby pictured looks far too much like Robert Carlyle with a week's stubble.  The descriptive back-cover blurb is also fairly uninviting.  We learn there's a character named \\"Gaskill Tyran\\", and this can bode well for nobody.  When the Doctor is described in the blurb's final sentence as a \\"mysterious infiltrator\\", I knew there was going to be trouble.<br />\\"Dark Progeny\\" itself is a thoughtful action-adventure piece, written in a very visual style.  This is to be expected from sophomore author Steve Emmerson, who previously wrote the visually-innovative \\"Casualties of War\\".  It's often a criticism hurled at DW book writers that they're trying too hard to write for the small screen, but Emmerson writes lush, big-budget SF.  Here we have grotesque monsters, fierce storms, lots of holograms, pretty starscapes, and a city-sized Machine.<br />The plot is something of a mess.  The prologue opens with a childbirth gone horribly wrong (and was probably inspired in the delivery room at 4 AM), and is followed by a parade of mean, cynical 30th-century human imperialists and corporate types.  The Doctor's two companions are brutalized, both mentally and by rat attack.  The 8th Doctor is his manic self, going over the top at a funeral and yet getting some nicely reflective moments when he's alone (and not acting).  The final 20 pages are an awful mess, with lots of dangling probabilities.  All the book's surviving characters burst into the same room all at once (but it's a big room) and there's one shockingly silly revelation about a villain's paternity.  The weird two-page epilogue feels as if it were shot 6 months after producton, on another set, and Anji wearing a different hairstyle.<br />On the whole, this is the \\"default\\" Eighth Doctor novel.  It incorporates all the positive and negative aspects of the line, and if DW were still a TV show, this would be that episode that was always on, the rerun you could never get away from -- but watched anyway.were still a TV show, this would be that episode that was always on, the rerun you could never get away from -- but watched anyway.	2002-04-12

The rules were often different, the style of play was different, and you couldn't watch it on ESPN Classic.<br />\\"Where They Ain't\\", however, is one of the better baseball books I've read.  Ostensibly about the old Baltimore Orioles of the National League in the 1890s, this book is really a micro-history of early baseball, tracing the game forward -- both on and off the field -- through the advent of Babe Ruth.  Burt Solomon paints a very convincing picture of those Orioles as the team that had the singlemost impact on the way the game is played today.  He chronicles the playing and early mangerial days of John McGraw, Ned Hanlon, Wilbert Robinson and Willie Keeler, and shows how they introduced the aggressive style of play -- the hit-and-run, the double-steal, the drag bunt, the Baltimore chop -- that still wins pennants today.<br />But more than profiling that now-defunct team, Solomon paints a vivid picture of the economics of the game at large.  Playing in ornate wood stadiums, a team would be lucky to draw 5,000 fans (or \\"cranks\\", in the parlace of the time) to the grandstands and \\"bleacheries\\".  The owners fiddled mercilessly with cost-cutting ideas such as contraction, team syndicates, and collusion.  Indeed, that these ideas all failed so miserably (forging the birth of the rival American League, a revolution which swallowed its own children so rapidly that within three years you couldn't tell one league from the other) that your eyebrows will leap off your head when you see that today's owners are still using them!  Certainly fans of the Minnesota Twins, Montreal Expos, and Baltimore Orioles (we've come full circle) will wince in agony as the old Oriole team was destroyed by league management three times in four years -- by ill-advised co-ownership with the Brooklyn Dodgers; by contraction out of the NL; and then by relocation to NewYork.<br />Solomon writes in a rich prose style, and footnotes his research extensively.  It must have been fun poring through old newspaper accounts for the colorful game descriptions he ultimately finds.  He subtly introduces us to historical changes, such as the three-strike out and the foot-long pitcher's rubber, with a broad \\"that will never catch on!\\" wink to the reader.  My chief complaints would be that \\"Where They Ain't\\" is a slow read -- and one so entrenched in Baltimore geography that it's unfathomable that a map wasn't printed inside the book.  I lived in Baltimore for parts of six years and even I frequently got lost in Solomon's directions.	2002-04-04

For further proof, one need only scroll down to the bottom of [amazon.com's] page about \\"Flashing Before My Eyes\\", to the section which reads: \\"Customers who bought titles by Dick Schaap also bought titles by these authors\\".  There, you'll find the names Don Zimmer and Mike Lupica (two other recent sports autobiographies)... as well as Mario Batali, and J.K. Rowling.  Clearly this was a man with distinct crossover appeal.<br />I regret that I cam to read \\"Flashing Before My Eyes\\" only after Mr. Schaap's untimely passing at the end of 2001, for it had been on my Wish List since its original publication date.  \\"Flashing\\" is a witty, urbane read, a book you can polish off in a couple of hours and yet one whose anecdotes will remain with you for quite some time.  Schaap's nature was to listen and observe, and after a half-century of journalism, he collected anecdotes about everyone from Bill Clinton to Bill Lee, Bob Knight to Bobby Kennedy, from Norman Mailer to Reggie Jackson.<br />Along the way are some terrific insights into writing and the state of journalism today, but never once will you feel as if you've been bashed over the head with the author's personal opinions.  It's easy for a longtime sports figure to turn his autobiography into a political manifesto (after reading Nolan Ryan's book, I was surprised to learn that he wasn't running for office), but like Don Zimmer's book, Schaap's is remarkably issue-free and hatchet-free, wry but never bitter.  He was a terrific observer, who saw everything but kvetched about little.  And yet, you still get into Schaap's head and understand what he was really thinking at all times.  He walked that fine line remarkable well.<br />If nothing else, read this book for the stories.  The most revealing moments are the chapters on the Watts riots, Bobby Kennedy, and gay Olympic decathlete Tom Waddell.  My favorite quote is from Reggie Jackson, as I once heard Schaap relate on ESPN Classic... \\"The magnitude of me\\".  If Dick Schaap hadn't been so modest and self-deprecating, that line could well have been this book's title.	2002-03-30

It's the first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; book I've read in months that turned me on the nuances of writing -- the plotting, the asides and observations, the scene structure.  This is the kind of book that inspires people *to* write ... to write something more than negative reviews, at any rate.<br />Maybe the book's success owes to its author, longtime DW standout Kate Orman, who's been doing this for nearly a decade now, and without a misstep (only her previous &quot;Unnatural History&quot;, written with husband Jon Blum, failed to energize).  The book rings with Kate's hallmarks -- in the first scene, a character suffers a panic attack while doing research in a library, and it's all set on an Earth colony world populated by humans (here, musicians) representing a specific ethnicity (here, Germans and Middle Easterners, although nothing is done with this premise).<br />During a delightful 50-page extended intro, we learn more about the Doctor and company than we did in the previous four or five noisy runarounds.  Then, in a great visual montage, the Tigers come to town.  It's an uneasy battle between man and big cat for dominance of Hitchemus's lone, tiny, land-mass.  Kate chooses to focus on just a few characters on each side, and this works to the book's advantage.  The tiger names (Bounce, Big, etc) may be a bit too anthropomorphized for your taste.<br />I love the pace at which the mystery of the tigers' ancient artifacts is solved, and I enjoy the way the Eighth Doctor does not fit well into either side of the war -- both sides impose their own values on him, while all he really wants to do is study, in peace and quiet.  The ending is, obviously, a deus ex machina, which could have been a disaster, but since it concludes the story logically (with, I think, heavy references to 1960s &quot;Star Trek&quot; throughout), I mark it down as a success.<br />Jon Blum is given story credit.  He wrote the historical interludes (set during the Doctor's 100-year amnesiac period on Earth), and is credited with portions of the dialogue.  It seems fairly obvious which scenes are his -- Jon's view of the Eighth Doctor is wildly sturm und drang, full of shouted declarations of principle.  However, both authors' handiwork is visible in the closing scene -- a reflective moment, summed with a quietly haunting line of dialogue.  Also great is an extended lecture on Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  The styles complement quite nicely.<br />The worst part about &quot;Intelligent Tigers&quot; is the knowledge that it will probably be many, many months before another quiet, reflective gem is published.Trek&quot; throughout), I mark it down as a success.<br />Jon Blum is given story credit.

I'm a Mets fan who grew up in a household that cheered for the Other Team, and before I was ten years old, I had memorized the starting lineup of the 1961 Yankees.  Reading the definitive work on the most successful championship run in baseball history (9 World Series titles and 14 American League pennants in 16 years) did not cause me to break out in hives.  Besides which, I read &quot;Dynasty&quot; simply as preparation for the author's forthcoming book on the Amazin's.<br />Lawyer-turned-baseball-writer Golenbock is celebrated for his oral histories of, among other teams, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs.  He's also written some less-than-memorable books, but &quot;Dynasty&quot; was his first, a deeply-researched labor of love which brings us the highlights of the 16 years when the Bronx Bombers humiliated the rest of the baseball world and shattered nearly every record in the book.  Golenbock, writing in the mid-1970s, travelled all over the country to meet the players and reconstruct a bygone era.  This project, then, did two things:  it produced a worthy, important book; and allowed him to avoid watching the less stellar team of the day, then playing in Shea Stadium with the likes of Elliot Maddox, Fritz Peterson, and Fred Stanley.<br />Each chapter in the book treats a single year in the dynasty.  The &quot;story&quot; of that season -- from the inevitable 9-22 record in spring training through the inevitable World Series victory over the Dodgers -- is interrupted for lengthy biographies of 3 or 4 of the pivotal players on that year's club.   Golenbock catches up with everyone, from Mantle and Ford to Bob Grim, Tom Sturdivant, and Ryne Duren.<br />The best interviews in the books are with the spikiest subjects -- a world-weary Roger Maris, sitting on the hood of a truck parked outside Clete Boyer's bar; a matured Sturdivant wondering what might have been had he tried hard; and the bitter, bitter Joe Pepitone.  In addition are memorable anecdotes about bruising bench-warmer Johnny Lindell, and general manager George Weiss's penurious contract negotiations.  Jim Bouton is also interviewed, so if you haven't read _Ball Four_ there's a good fifteen-page summary of what he wrote earlier (and a spooky interjection by his soon-to-be ex-wife, predicting his late-'70s comeback with the Atlanta Braves).<br />A word about statistical accuracy:  Ths is a book about Heroes, and it was written before the first Baseball Abstract.  If you don't like generalizations in your statistics, if you don't want to hear about .260-hitting &quot;team players&quot; and guys who &quot;know how to win when it counts&quot;, or read phrases like &quot;He didn't have many hits, but they were all clutch hits&quot;, then for you, the definitive book on the Yankee dynasty has not yet been written.  From a stats analysis, there may have been less to these world-beating Yankees than meets the eye.  But they still won 14 pennants in 16 years.<br />Overall, lacking the sheer scope of _Bums_ or _Fenway_, but if the Mantle-Maris-Berra-Billy Martin Yankees still mean anything to you, this is the first book to read.	2002-03-16
US	51345392	R1LT6EYFB1VXYY	0060954809	385195167	Ghosts of Manila: The Fateful Blood Feud Between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier	Books	2	4	8	N	N	The 900-pound Gorilla takes on Manila	\\"Ghosts of Manila\\" is an overwrought, angry 230-age opinion piece, which seeks to \\"explode myths\\" about Muhammad Ali, and set the historical record straight.  From a rhetorical point of view, it achieves this goal nearly as well as Liston delivered against Muhammad Ali in Lewiston, Maine in 1965.<br />This is not the way the book should have been.  The idea is brilliant -- after Ali-Frazier III, Frazier was out of boxing within months (and never won another bout), and Ali never again hurt so much as a flea.  A book about the boxers in decline (Frazier didn't amount to much afterwards, and Ali was a physical ruin, a wordless, spectral icon) could have moved mountains of emotion.  Certainly books about boxers reach their subjects far more effectively than books about other sports, and Mark Kram could have penned an all-time classic.<br />\\"Manila\\" dwells most on the fighters' creation: Frazier as blue-collar champion for a moment, Ali as a mindless puppet of the overhyped Nation of Islam movement.  Seeking to rehabilitate Frazier's reputation in the public eye, Kram doesn't really make much of a case for Frazier as one of boxing's great heavyweights, and regrettably doesn't make him very interesting in the present day, either.<br />The rest is a phillipic against Ali, whom the author knew as a magazine writer, and didn't admire much.  Conversations between author and champ are reprinted verbatim, and are never polite.  The words carefully chosen to describe Ali are belittling and derogatory.  Kram can't praise him as a boxer, either -- after two paragraphs praising Ali's ring style, he introduces us to an Italian novelist who explains that, really, Ali was artless and free of drama in the squared circle.  Well, that helps.  There was a point of view I'd never considered before.<br />Kram touches other vendettas as well.  A one-page summary of Howard Cosell finds the time to use words and phrases like \\"amoeba\\" and \\"small-time eviction lawyer\\".  Bryant Gumbel is summarily dismissed in three paragraphs.  It's the most cynical book I've read in years.<br />\\"Ghosts of Manila\\" is a noteworthy rant, a logical attack on th way we see Ali -- saving its heaviest ammunition, an interview with Ali's \\"fifth wife\\" and a forgotten daughter, for the very end.  The book finally becomes fresh when we get to Manila, a great fight about which little has been written.  But the road to Manila is far from an interesting one.	2002-03-15

Don Zimmer, of course.  &quot;Zim: A Baseball Life&quot; is 52 years' worth of anecdotes from the one guy who's been everywhere and seen it all.<br />Zim's the only man to have been in uniform at all three New York Yankees' perfect games (the first and last of which were 43 years apart); he played a pivotal role in the Brooklyn Dodgers' lone World Series victory (by coming out of the game early); he was the first to play third base for the New York Mets (hundreds have followed, and, like Zim, none lasted very long); and he managed the 1978 Boston Red Sox when Bucky Dent hit that pop fly over the Green Monster on October 2nd.<br />&quot;Zim&quot; is a fast read, spilling over with Zim stories on every page.  It's written on a very simple level, but is meticulously researched and, as a result, is completely authoritative.  A couple of factual errors pop up, yes, which co-writer Bill Madden probably could have caught (Zim is said to have received roses when the Yankees won the 1999 season opener; news that is surprising when you remember the Yanks lost that game), but overall the errors, like strands of Zim's hair, are few and far between.<br />The 2002 baseball season is about to begin and, no surprise, Zimmer will be there in uniform again.  He's a funny guy (and a funny-looking guy) and it does the troubled sport of baseball a world of good that Zimmer is still around, the link between Pee Wee Reese and Derek Jeter, Clem Labine and Mariano Rivera, Sal Maglie and Roger Clemens, Walter O'Malley and George Steinbrenner.  Here's hoping Zim has another half-century's worth of stories left in that massive belly of his.	2002-03-10

He flourished for 20 years with forgettable teams, finishing with 438 home runs and 314 steals, a terrific combination of power and speed.  He was also one of the highest-profile victims of the 1987 owner collusion that rocked the sport, and the first player from a last-place team to be named Most Valuable Player of his league.<br />However, &quot;Hawk&quot; is completely run-of-the-mill.  At less than 200 pages in length, and written at a junior-high-school reading level, it's a book I read in one weekend.  Entire years of Dawson's career fly by in a single paragraph -- and even then it was written two years before he retired.  What few individual games he describes, are poorly-remembered: there are some annoying statistical errors that could have been resolved by Dawson's co-author merely looking at boxscores.<br />Dawson's biography is really about his Christian faith, and about the support of his family through lean times.  The book came out through a Christian publishing division, so that's no surprise.  The final chapter ends with a sermon about living positively and an invocation to the Lord.<br />In terms of being a good baseball book, there's an intriguing early look at current star Alex Rodriguez (Dawson writes in 1994).  There's a good concise history of the ownership-players labor strife, and two memorable stories: one about Dawson's signing wih the Cubs in 1987, and another about a shocking act of racial prejudice in Montreal.  But in the long run, the stories of faith are inferior to Dave Dravecky's in &quot;Comeback&quot;, and the labor history falls short of even &quot;Ball Four&quot;.<br />&quot;Hawk&quot; is aimed primarily at Christian teens, and works best when read on that level.  When Dawson is elected to the Hall of Fame in 2003, however, his autobiography will not go with him.	2002-02-25

The bulk of \\"The Forever Boys\\" tells their stories.  Nearly every story sounds the same:  Drugs.  Alcohol.  Injuries.  Myopic management.  All the stories are told in an omniscient voice, with phrases so cliched and hackneyed, they rise to the level of \\"VH1's Behind the Music\\" art-kisch.<br />\\"Forever Boys\\" is most memorable, perhaps, if you came of baseball age between 1976 and 1983.  In the book are the life stories of Pat Zachry and Gary Rajsich, both of whom played in the first baseball game I ever went to.  I recognized all the names from my late '70s Topps baseball card collections.  Golenbock is at his best when the stories don't have happy endings -- the fall from grace of Sammy Stewart is perhaps the book's most effective writing.<br />But for every objective look at why a player failed, there are another ten instances of poor research (when Golenbock states that the 1981 Brewers had the best record in baseball before the strike, take out your pencil, cross it out, and write \\"tenth-best\\" in the margin.  Go ahead!) or subjective reporting.  Every game won in the Senior League is a test of wills, or a validation of an entire career, and the screening of Tom Hanks in \\"BIG\\" on the team bus becomes an epiphany worthy of James Joyce.  Or not.<br />\\"Forever Boys\\" is an excellent source of anecdotes, but is not a keeper for your all-time collection.	2002-02-18

I read this book directly after finishing Rob Neyer's &quot;Feeding the Green Monster&quot;.  Both books were written by writers-as-fans, jumping on the Red Sox bandwagon a year after the team made the playoffs (Neyer in 2000, Hough in 1987).  The books' approaches have nothing to do with each other, but the results are similar.<br />Hough's book occurs almost entirely during batting practice.  Using a season-long press pass, he went to the Fenway clubhouse and dugout during home games to interview the players and coaches, and find out how these players turned their childhood baseball fantasies into reality, when the author couldn't.  There's a lot of breathless descriptions of the sun setting behind the right-field bleachers, or the moon climbing over the stadium.  Fenway is almost always empty, save for autograph-hounds above the dugout.  Compare to Neyer, who sat in the stands for 81 home games and never met a single player.<br />The interviews, instead of providing the background for detailed player biographies, are printed verbatim in the book.  Hough, over 40 at the time of writing, found it easier to speak with coaches: former Sox star Johnny Pesky, and future Sox manager Joe Morgan (not the blowhard ESPN announcer).  These two appear most often and are the funniest characters in the book.<br />Also fascinating is the glimpse at the Red Sox in transition, in between the aging playoff club of 1986, and the young powerhouse that won the A.L. East in '88 and '90.  It's nice to know that Roger Clemens and Ellis Burks, seen here as kids, are still star players today.<br />The most poignant stories in the book involve aging players who've lost their ability entirely -- Robin Roberts, struggling in the low minors at the end of his career, and Mel Parnell, unable to pitch on Old-Timers' Day.  The rest is made up of Hough's junior-high baseball stories.  You may feel more charitable about those than I.  Recommended in general, if you like the Red Sox.	2002-02-10

I attended one, and even that was shortened by rain.  He sat in Fenway Park for all 81 Boston Red Sox home games.  I saw the Red Sox only during their battles with the Yankees that year, and apart from Scott Brosius's killing-blow home run off Pedro Martinez that September, I remember little.  But I devoured &quot;Feeding the Green Monster&quot; in just a few days, racing through the Red Sox's also-ran season just to read what Neyer would have to say about it, wishing I had been there in his entourage.<br />&quot;Green Monster&quot; is a diary, a confessional -- at the end, Rob writes, &quot;I fell in love twice this season, with a ballpark named Fenway and a woman named (spoiler removed)&quot;.  There are entries covering Opening Day through the offseason, but not each one is as meticulous or documented as his ESPN.com columns.  As with Rob's previous work, the book is better when he's in full-on research mode.  The entries concerning Gary Gaetti, Johnny Pesky, the 1946 World Series, and the history of the outfield wall now called the Green Monster, are outstanding.<br />The personal content is also intriguing, although the fact that the author could devote a whole season to buying tickets at Fenway -- and then flying or riding to 35 other games in other cities -- hints that it might be easier for Neyer to be a baseball fan than most of his readers.  I always wanted more details on the people he went to games with -- we come to know Fenway's scalpers better than the author's girlfriends.  Passages such as &quot;Baseball fans in these parts are about as moody as a pregnant woman who forgot to each lunch&quot; should have been deleted long before publication.<br />I've only been to Fenway once, and came out just a little bit more enamored of the Red Sox -- not an easy thing to do, as I am a New Yorker.  After finishing &quot;Feeding the Green Monster&quot;,I found I wanted to be there at Fenway again, rooting for the likes of Tim Wakefield and counting Pedro Martinez's strikeouts.  Rob Neyer's diary of the 2000 season is far from perfect, but it's unique in its approach and its refreshing lack of interviews with ballplayers.  Rob is Every-Fan, our agent in the bleacher seats, and it would be kind of nice if he could write a book like this again.	2002-02-04
US	51345392	R1DMQWLL746XU4	0563538325	680798848	Eater of Wasps (Doctor Who)	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A book that deserves great BUZZ	This is one of the worst book covers I've ever seen.  What are we looking at?  The wasps are easily identifiable, but just what are they flying on?  It doesn't look anything like a mouth, although I gather that's what it's supposed to be.  Would you want to buy this based on the cover alone?<br />However, the story itself is a real treat, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;'s trademark horror in pastoral setting.  It's England, late summer 1933, one of those parochial villages where spinsters on bicycles terrorize local libertines, where vicars stroll around giving poor advice, a single mother bears a terrible secret, and a loutish American (charmingly described as having an &quot;American&quot; accent) dies early on.  The village, in short, is full of White Anglo-Saxon Protestants, and these WASPS don't fare very well when Terror flies down the garden path.<br />An alien device lands in a dentist's toolshed and almost immediately a nest of garden wasps is transformed into something more than insect.  The dentist is stung and slowly, painfully transformed into something neither WASP nor wasp.  The Doctor tracks him, loses him, tracks him, loses him, until the stakes are real and everyone is in mortal terror.<br />&quot;Eater&quot; becomes a true page-turner with some stunningly good moments, such as the dentist's final thoughts before the wasp infection consumes him completely.  In the mix is a pair of human time travellers on a secret mission to destroy the alien artifact.  Quite thankfully we don't find out where they come from or, indeed, just what that object was.  This poses a mystery that will reportedly be addressed in later books.<br />The Doctor here is as perfectly Tom Baker as we've seen since the mid-1970s.  The Eighth Doctor was never very effective in the early books and it's good to see that his personality has been consumed by the larger-than-life humor and horror of his most popular predecessor.  Companion Anji is not impressed by his occasionally cavalier attitude, and this too is a conflict I'd love to see resolved further on.<br />&quot;Eater of Wasps&quot; is a deftly-told tale and a great read, and if it had come with a better cover I'd recommend it to my non-DW-fan friends.  It also plants interesting seeds for future 8th Doctor novels and I'm eagerly awaiting the next installment.	2001-12-24

It has a great hook as the first book -- it really is about the First Book, the epic of Gilgamesh.<br />The story is a blend of the historical -- Gilgamesh and Enkidu, Uruk and Kush, Ishtar and Ea -- mixed neatly with the time-travel/science-fiction &quot;Doctor Who&quot; formula -- an evil robot woman from the stars comes to Ancient Earth and manipulates the nascent civilization in her evil scheme for universal domination.  Enter the Seventh Doctor and Ace, helping Gilgamesh find his destiny and lay off the local beer.<br />Lots of characters from the first 30 years of DW history -- old friends, even two old Doctors -- make cameo appearances in the book.  The novel's resolution even depends in part upon the Third Doctor showing up to assist the Seventh.  And yet the story -- human heroes and powerful aliens struggling for control over the future of human history -- moves along quickly, with lots of drinking and fighting and philosophizing.  There is a reliance on continuity but that never really harms the book.<br />&quot;Genesys&quot; has been criticized over the years for its poor characterization of the Seventh Doctor and Ace.  There's also a sophomoric attitude towards sex (never seen in DW before up to this point) and an awful lot of bare breasts and senseless killing.  However, there's a mostly happy conclusion and the book is mostly devoid of the darkness that would enshroud the Doctor in many subsequent New Adventures.  It is not the best sci-fi tie-in novel ever written but it is good of its kind.	2001-12-20
US	51345392	R1MTZC32ZJ08NZ	0563538384	311511099	The Shadow in the Glass (Doctor Who)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Won't leave you Glassy-eyed	Right off the bat, forget that this book was plotted overnight, and written in just three weeks by the former and current &quot;Doctor Who&quot; editors at BBC Books.  In spite of the behind-the-scenes woes (shown here as spelling errors and details that change in the middle of scenes), the book is quite enjoyable.<br />As with any Justin Richards book, the story sets up slowly, each chapter introducing a new character and idea, or a new setting.  &quot;Shadow/Glass&quot; opens as a UFO crashes near a RAF military base in 1944, and slowly works up to the present day.  Neo-Nazis gather in England and Antarctica, using alien technology -- and someone who looks a lot like Adolf Hitler -- in preparation for the Fourth Reich (given how many other Fourth Reichs there have been in recent DW, this should really be the Eighth Reich...).<br />As the mystery unfolds, the retired Brigadier and intrepid journalist Claire investigate Hitler's death, and the Sixth Doctor travels through time and meets a war epic's worth of historical figures.  Tension mounts and builds up to the showdown with the aliens, and Hitler's suicide in the Berlin bunker in April, 1945.<br />At the end, the book self-destructs, with a too-short action sequence and a too-stale historical reenactment.  Because this is the Sixth Doctor, there's some forced angst literally on the final page, and the Brigadier makes an unusually clumsy metaphor to try and cheer him up.<br />But never mind the rushed ending -- &quot;Shadow/Glass&quot; is a fun mixture of time travel and authentic history that, in its best moments, summons up the thriving spirit of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and makes for great potboiler sci-fi.  Highly recommended.	2001-12-10
US	51345392	R3KI2IIO5NGG91	0563538295	652651673	Vanishing Point (Doctor Who)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A rather dull Point	&quot;Vanishing Point&quot; is a thoughtful novel with a dynamic role for the Eighth Doctor and another strong showing for new series regular Anji Kapoor.  Former series editor Stephen Cole, in his first solo DW novel, works up a good mixture of philosophy and action sequences and in the author's own mind, I'm sure, the planetary setting must have looked really *neat*.  There are cliffs, and rocky spires jutting out of oceans, city slums and mushroom-shaped skyscrapers.<br />In outline form this novel may have looked like a real corker.  There are surprises and revelations at many turns -- one of the main supporting characters is a cross between a homicide detective and a priest, so there's a lot of mystery afoot.<br />Unfortunately, you have to read the prose in order to finish the novel, and there are missteps aplenty.  On the first page, we see &quot;smoky clouds&quot; blow across &quot;the moon's laughing face&quot;.  There are bizarre attempts at comedy.  The villain has a penchant for eating bananas, so of course a henchman will slip on a banana peel at a pivotal moment.  The two romances (a priest and a prostitute, and Fitz is seduced by a deformed woman) don't seem to work very well, especially in the latter case -- perhaps because, after the sex, all the repercussions are glossed over.  Realistic, perhaps.  Interesting to read?  No.<br />Even though the Doctor has a good presence -- that mixture of wacky irreverence and ferocious concentration that has suited the character well for decades -- he still gets kicked in the head while hiding behind a man's legs in the book's very first scene.<br />I wanted to like &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; more than I finally did.  The book raises a lot of moral questions and the religious content is fresh.  However, it was a chore to read and in the end did not leave a huge impression.	2001-11-30

It's moody and gruesome and contains almost intimidating amounts of British extreme culture as sampled in the mid-1970s.  Certainly many references to punk band I'm quite sure I've never heard of.  Nominally a story featuring the Third Doctor (long seen as a figure of the Establishment), the bubbly Jo Grant, and UNIT, this book views our heroes through a glass very darkly indeed.<br />Rampant references to punk culture, Stonehenge, and Doctor Who's private angst -- how's that for a combination?  Well, 1994's &quot;No Future&quot; got there first, but &quot;Rags&quot; is far more extreme and gritty, and sans the happy, fluffy ending.<br />Still, if you can stomach the constant stream of blood and cynicism -- first-time DW author Lewis doesn't seem to be taking anybody's side, and the only character with a happy ending has to leave our &quot;dimension&quot; to achieve it -- you'll find this to be a harrowing, intelligent read in the style of some of Stephen King's darker hours.  Surely if Richard Bachman were British this is the kind of book you might reasonably expect to see him write.<br />Obviously &quot;Rags&quot; cannot be recommended to everyone, but it's written in a bold style and tells us that this is a story the author *really* wanted to tell.  Since we so rarely see such storytelling passion in our DW novels these days, &quot;Rags&quot; certainly brightened my month.  In a dark way.	2001-11-21

This gorgeously-designed hardcover, with glossy pages and a heavy silver dustjacket, is a terrific companion to the TV special, and an almost essential shelf companion to &quot;Peanuts: A Golden Celebration&quot;.<br />Anything you'd want to know about the &quot;Christmas&quot; TV special is in this book -- lengthy interviews with producer Lee Mendelson (a veteran of Peanuts anniversary books) and animator Bill Melendez.  Charles M Schulz passed away before the book was written, but there are plenty of rarely-seen photos of him taken in the 1960s.  There's a chapter on Vince Guaraldi, whose jazz soundtrack defines the lives of many &quot;Peanuts&quot; fans; interviews with some of the children who voiced the characters; and, O happy day, sheet music!  The second half of the book contains the complete script for &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; itself, along with dozens of photos and animated sequences, taken from the original cels.<br />&quot;Christmas&quot; is not for small children (unless they're reading it with you), and there are a couple of misprints (including, in my first edition, a caption for a photo that's not in the book!).  But it's lovely to look at, and when I put it down finally, reluctantly, I was whistling the soundtrack and hearing Linus's nativity speech (and I'm Jewish!).  These days you can buy it for about as much as the DVD costs, and it's a wonderful Christmas gift.  Unless, of course, the person you're buying it for already owns it.	2001-11-19

A book begins with 150 pages of token plot exposition and character development, and then the final 150 pages essentially ignore the build-up in favor of running around and blowing things up.  Major characters die, to lend the book an &quot;adult&quot; feel, and maybe there's a token unconvincing romance.<br />Not Jac Rayner's &quot;Earthworld&quot; -- Jac (the first woman to solo-write a DW novel in five years) neatly flips the formula on its head.  Here the silly running around is confined to the beginning.  Earthworld is a wacky historical theme park, built on &quot;New Jupiter&quot; (ha ha) thousands of years in the future.  The android park attractions run amok and kill a lot of people offscreen.  An Elvis impersonator strips down to (glittery sequined) boxer shorts for an impromptu game of Celebrity Deathmatch.  The name of the President of Earthworld begins &quot;John F. ...&quot;.  See where this is going?<br />Happily, Jac puts back all the stops and submits a final 100 pages that are more serious and thoughtful than anyone had a right to expect, based on the beginning and middle.  Characters suddenly interact in touching ways.  There's a thoughtful, happy ending for (most of) the Earthworld characters.  The TARDIS crew, fractured for so long, are handled with something akin to tenderness:  Fitz gains new resolve, the Doctor begins to function even without his memory, and Anji...<br />...Anji, in only her second book as companion, is rewarded with a stunning 7-page finale that works through the trauma that befell her in &quot;Escape Velocity&quot;, her debut.  Especially coming as they do so soon after the silly opening, these final pages left me quite satisfied with &quot;Earthworld&quot; indeed.<br />Even if broad, miss-the-mark satire isn't your game, you'll still enjoy &quot;Earthworld&quot;, a deeper book than usual.	2001-11-14

It's not even the best First Doctor book ever written.<br />It just seems to be.<br />&quot;Bunker Soldiers&quot; comes along at a wonderful time:  there hasn't been a First Doctor adventure in about a year and a half, and the two Past Doctor books before &quot;BS&quot; in the schedule were excessively silly, or continuity-heavy.<br />But Martin Day writes a simple, stripped down morality tale, centered around a minor historical event, the Mongol destruction of Kiev in the 13th century.  As he Doctor tries to reason with the bloodthirsty and strangely honor-bound Khan, Steven and Dodo are besieged in Kiev and hunted by a strange angelic (or demonic) presence.  Meanwhile, several citizens of Kiev grapple with problems of faith and mortality.<br />This &quot;bunker soldier&quot; stalking Kiev may indeed turn out to be some rationally-explained robot, with lots of wires and a remote control.  But in the novel, it really fulfills the role of Death.  It's a stark symbol, and while not as memorable as Death in &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, it's comfortably close.<br />&quot;Bunker Soldiers&quot; is fast and blunt and neither too skimpy nor heavy on detail.  It's not the perfect First Doctor novel, but at times, it sure seems to be.	2001-11-06

It's a sequel to a 30 year-old TV serial (&quot;The Time Monster&quot;), and a followup to author Craig Hinton's previous book &quot;Millennial Rites&quot;.  It builds on some of the themes of the worst-regarded DW book in recent years, &quot;Divided Loyalties&quot;.  There's a boatload of returning friends and enemies and more references to past DW stories (real and apocryphal) then you could find in a series episode guide.<br />Predictably, some parts of &quot;Archangel&quot; are more fun to read than others.  When Hinton sticks to his &quot;Time Monster&quot; sequel -- reusing not only characters from the 1972 story, but also entire scenes -- I found myself smiling along.  The Master's appearance is well thought-out and at times really fun to read.<br />However, as one wag put it, &quot;Craig has a degree in physics, and isn't afraid to use it!&quot;.  So here we get the most expansive treatise ever on how the DW &quot;universe&quot; is organized.  We learn about eleven dimensions and the Six-fold realm and the Lux Aeterna.  There are Eternals and Chronovores (two characters switch from one to the other almost at random) and Six Guardians.  There's a &quot;Mad Mind of Bophemeral&quot; (I've always wanted one of those).  We see just how the Key to Time was created (remember the Key to Time?).  For good measure a &quot;Millennium War&quot; is recreated -- in just a few pages!  Keep the caffeine away from the typewriter, Craig!<br />Of course, cartoon astrophysics may even appeal to you.  In &quot;Quantum Archangel&quot; there's literally something for everyone, if you know which page to read.	2001-11-04

Dave Stone has been writing &quot;Doctor Who&quot; books for years, and almost anyone who chooses to buy &quot;Heart of TARDIS&quot; should know what to expect even before they open it.  Even so, &quot;Heart&quot; manages to pack in more Stone excess than any novel he has ever written before.  That's a bad sign.<br />The two sets of Doctor/companion pairings bear no relation to the characters (and actors) we remember from TV.  The plot makes no sense, being a treatise on quantum physics written in crayon by a guy who just wants to stick big words together.  There are references galore to other, better books and TV series -- part of this confusing mess of a novel takes place in the Springfield of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.  For humor value only.<br />There are, in the midst of the morass, some nice jokes:  Victoria, a sheltered 19th century girl, hears gangsta rap for the first time.  The hammy Fourth Doctor overacts wildly in a room full of dusty furniture.  A bookstore's shelves are overflowing with &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels.<br />But don't take my word for how bad this book is.  Here, free of charge, is some sample prose: &quot;as much relation to the truth as a toboggan does to a small tub of weasel cheese&quot;, &quot;set to tear reality apart like a rotten walrus&quot;, &quot; as the data-stream linkages between two computer networks have to a toaster plugged into a power outlet...&quot;, and of course &quot;as similar to that of human recollection as the sound of a tuba is similar to a monkey in a little hat.&quot;<br />The book is unreadable.

He's almost certainly reading this review.  So, happily, &quot;King of Terror&quot; is exactly what you would expect from a man of Keith's public persona.  Loud, illogical, and often amusing.<br />There's real heart in this book...the individual characters are more carefully thought-out than in other recent &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels.  On the other hand, I think Topping is guilty of overthinking the three regulars too much.  The Fifth Doctor gets far too few light moments.  Turlough... his fate is both gross and completely irrelevant to the book.  If this were a TV story you'd think he filmed his scenes in one afternoon and went on vacation for the rest of the shoot.  Tegan is so hard-bitten and hard-drinking that you'd think she was Bernice Summerfield (a more strident character from a different line of DW books).<br />The rest of the book basks in references to things Keith evidently likes:  pop music, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and thirty-year-old &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV stories.  I like books that reflect the moment, and &quot;King of Terror&quot; does.  All the characters speak in exactly the same way Topping does on rec.arts.drwho.<br />The book is set in Los Angeles, but the prose is a little inadequate to describe all the stunning vistas you'd find there.  There are, as I recall, zero native Angelenos.  I was expecting more of a travelogue (this is &quot;Doctor Who&quot;'s first-ever visit to L.A.).  Maybe next time.<br />&quot;King of Terror&quot; never really takes flight (like the spaceship on the cover which appears to be sitting on the ground), but it's one of the more ambitious Past Doctor Adventures we've had in the past several months.	2001-10-27

I expected more from &quot;Independence Day&quot;, because it was written by Peter Darvill-Evans, who created the notion of original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; books after the TV series was cancelled.  Darvill-Evans edited the first few years' worth of books and remained in charge of the series for years after that.  However, his own DW novel, &quot;Deceit&quot;, was a widely considered a disappointment, and this second effort makes many of the same mistakes.<br />The Seventh Doctor and Ace have little to do here.  The Doctor leads a large band of silly-named feudal serfs from Mendeb Two, but spends the book's climax locked in a cage, near-death.  Ace quickly becomes drugged and mind-controlled and is turned into both a gladiator... and a kitchen maid (is it possible to be both of those at the same time?)  The sexual content is, quite frankly, offensive.  So is the murder-suicide that taints the book's final chapter.  On the final pages, two departing lovers quote &quot;Casablanca&quot; at each other, without a hint of irony.<br />The book itself is competently written.  I simply found it hard to appreciate the subject matter.  With 22 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels published each year, it is increasingly becoming advisable to save your money only for those books you really want to read.

I'd read and mostly enjoyed Executive Orders, which contained elements similar to the real-life disaster. From Tom Clancy, I was expecting a cutting-edge description of 21st century warfare, and lots of right-wing politicizing. I got both of those. In spades. In buckets and spades.<br />The first half of The Bear and the Dragon is a leisurely setting up of the chess pieces. A cartoon version of China (whose Politburo is staffed by half-a-dozen foaming copies of Ming the Merciless) wages war on a newly prosperous Russia. The Russians are all hard drinkin' law and order cops. The United States, whose Democrat-led government was swept aside by terrorists two Clancy books ago, has been remade as a conservative military power.<br />And what a power they are! In the second half of the book (roughly 400 pages of the 1100-plus), or about 48 hours of real-time, the USA thwarts the Red Communist threat. It's to Clancy's credit that I read every page of the book and absorbed all his political views, ranging from abortion to religion to gun control to tobacco and booze, and back to religion again (this Clancy guy really watches his &quot;O'Reilly Factor&quot;!). But I knew what I was getting into, so apart from the occasional eye-roll I didn't mentally fight back.<br />If you can stay awake for the 1100 pages, you'll find an old-fashioned flag-waving romp over the Evil Enemy (is there really any other kind). The final 100 pages turn funny as President Ryan leaps out of the Oval Office and into action in the unlikeliest of places. Bear/Dragon has about 0% literary merit, but most people read it for the hardware and the bombs and the political asides, so if you're up for three weeks' worth of those, you're in for a few smiles. And eye-rolls.	2001-10-17

I've sensed recently a need for books that aren't just action run-arounds, set on alien planets with silly names, books where the Doctor himself has almost nothing to contribute.  I sense a greater need for the &quot;novel&quot;, for a book that spends more time on character and prose, for something with a little more thought behind the words.<br />&quot;Father Time&quot; is a big step in the right direction.  Lance Parkin can usually be relied upon for a better-than-average read, although I've yet to find one of his novels that works on every level.  &quot;Father Time&quot; is divided up into three almost self-contained novellas that stretch out through a gently exaggerated version of the 1980s.<br />The first section is set in the &quot;Early 1980s&quot;, as a still amnesiac Doctor has settled into a happy sort of inconsequential life in a snowy part of England.  Gradually he becomes involved in the life of Miranda, a grammar-school girl with a keen intellect.. and two hearts.  Two honor-bound alien warriors (and a Go-Bot) are pursuing the girl, attempting to answer the oldest unanswered question in &quot;Who&quot; history (&quot;If you knew that child would grow up to be evil... could you then kill that child?&quot;).  The writing throughout this section is nearly superb.<br />The middle section is the &quot;Mid&quot; 1980s, although a Phil Collins song released in 1988 is heard playing on a stereo (I suspect Parkin kept the dates deliberately vague to add a fairy-tale mystique to the book).  We follow Miranda, now the Doctor's daughter, into her teenage years.  The plotting is 90% soap opera (Parkin is a former British soap writer), although the prose is far better than a &quot;Sweet Valley High&quot; novel.<br />The book's final section resolves Miranda's flight from the alien forces still out to destroy her.  The plot is pure &quot;Moonraker&quot; and the closing political monologue is baffingly awful.  The rest of the book is of such a high standard that the ending is, bizarrely, more disappointing then the bad ending of a book that was bad throughout.<br />On the whole, however, reading &quot;Father Time&quot; can be an exhilirating experience.  The characters and the action are crisper than that of most previous &quot;Who&quot; novels, and there are moments of great humor and great pathos.  A worthy near-miss.	2001-09-22

There's an awful lot of agenda on the plate of Colin Brake, writing a DW novel for the first time.  There's the return of Fitz, last seen 6 books ago.  The introduction of a new companion, Anji (a soulful, sexy... stockbroker??).  The return of the TARDIS, the original TARDIS (last seen a year ago).  And the escape of Doctor Who into Time and Space once more.<br />Escape Velocity is a genial romp.  Two factions of an archetypal alien race (the insane warmongerers and the peaceful philosopher-kings) are stranded on Earth, working on competing teams to send the first privately-built vehicle into space.  Those competing teams were once friends (and of course, right in betweeen is the women they loved).  This is a simple and effective setup, and a good thematic backdrop for the Doctor's own escape into space.<br />However, the book tends to zip along with all the energy of a pulp story, when it could be argued that this novel, of all others, required a little more thought and dignity (and better-edited prose).  Nothing unpredictable or novel ever happens.<br />It's best to read &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; as a collection of set pieces.  The Doctor's reintroduction to Fitz, and the TARDIS's rebirth, both should bring a smile to the reader's face.  Anji, the new companion, is an excellent stockbroker and a slightly less excellent girlfriend.  We know this because Brake tells us so -- every couple of chapters, when it becomes important, a piece of character outline is stapled into the text.  This is nothing new -- technical fiction writers dump their exposition into the text at necessary times (Tom Clancy and Michael Crichton to name obvious examples).  It speaks better of the surrounding books that we've come to expect more than this from our &quot;Doctor Who&quot; potboilers, and that's why it's disappointing here.<br />Escape Velocity is a fast, easy read, safe and predictable.  Not necessarilyin a good sense.  When the Doctor is returned to space, we don't get a taste of new, dangerous uncharted waters -- we simply get a replay of the very first &quot;Doctor Who&quot; cliffhanger, from 1963.  A sense of adventure and the unknown has been lost, and it will be up to future writers to return &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to the cutting edge where it has thrived for parts of five decades.	2001-09-16

McIntee has finally churned out the svelte book we've been waiting for since his 1993 knockout debut effort White Darkness. This hard-hitting look at the death of Rasputin pulls no punches, and we're left with a winning historical novel.<br />That's right, a pure historical. Oh, it doesn't seem that way at first -- this book opens in Tunguska in 1908, a scene familiar to those who've read the right DW novels and seen the right X-Files episodes (interestingly, McIntee was also the first DW writer to reference X-Files in his fiction). But happily, the novel stays focussed in and around palace intrigue in 1916 St. Petersburg. There is romance, religion gone awry, and, as this is nominally a 3rd Doctor novel, a Bondian subplot.<br />Since it's short and has large print and wide margins, Wages of Sin is almost entirely about G. E. Rasputin and his effect on the ladies of the TARDIS. He and the Doctor share just one brief, mute exchange, through a sheet of ice (and it's a marvelous visual). The Mad Monk also flirts with Jo and verbally fences with Liz.<br />The choice of companions is unique -- Elizabeth Shaw returns from Cambridge after Season 10, but shares little if any page time with the Doctor. Or perhaps this is not peculiar; Caroline John and Jon Pertwee had a similar lack of chemistry during their lone year together. Liz, and Jo, are well-portrayed and used here. Jo falls for Rasputin, but isn't made out as a dimwit; McIntee appears to have sympathy for her point of view and even the Doctor condones it. And Liz's scientific ruminations mirror the dry, lecture-prone writing, but that's preferable to Liz's other first-ever journey through time (Eye of the Giant), in which all she wants to do is wash her hair.<br />The lone fault of the DW historical is that we already know what happens, and the Doctor usually isn't there when it does. This time, he has to run halfway to Finland just to miss out on most of Rasputin's exquisite 30-page death sequence. Jo and Liz are the actors here. Thankfully Pertwee is very faithfully rendered while he's on the page.<br />The attention to detail is fine. There's a dandy explanation as to how no poison surfaced in Rasputin's corpse, in spite of the copious amounts Yusopov (or Youssopov, &amp;c. -- McIntee has a smorgasboard of transliterations to choose from with all the factual characters) fed him. There's no postscript, unfortunately -- a longer novel may have taken us to the real-life Yusupov's final days, which include a high-profile American lawsuit against a Rasputin TV movie.  Or could have used the fickle memory of the blind old man as a framing tale. But in Wages of Sin, we get just the assassination plotnothing but fact, avoiding the fanciful or silly, and it's a nice change of pace from the norm.	2001-08-06

After Virgin's &quot;Doctor Who&quot; license lapsed, I chose not to follow the Benny NAs.  I came to this book solely because it was written by Kate Orman, and I wanted to read her non-DW work to see what she was up to.  Happily, &quot;Walking to Babylon&quot; is a marveolous book.As with most DW stories, it benefits from a small cast.  This provides for a small-scale, charming read, strongly in Kate's tradition.  Ancient Babylon is threatened by a recurring storyline from the Benny Books, and even though I entered this series with Book 10, I was able to follow along.  Bernice, as always in Kate's stories a savvy, well-read archaelogist, hardly ever a hostage to campiness, is dispatched to 570 BCE to foil an alien incursion of dubious intentions. Babylon is gentle and evocative of other locales Kate's visited, and Earth's distant past is never patronized.I only had two problems with the book.  First, and this is a problem also extant in SLEEPY, Return of the Living Dad, and Room With No Doors, is that the initial premise -- a rich one -- gets lost in a set of non-threatening plot twists about halfway through. The guest cast is replaced by characters not present at the outset, and the end result, playing with a different set of cards, is always less memorable.Second is John Lafayette, the Edwardian translator mistakenly transported to Babylon, where he becomes an erstwhile romantic foil for Benny. The Benny/John pairing has things to say about sex, mores, and politics -- it's just that these statements once again catapult Benny into the preachy caricature she's been in far too many prior books. Self-righteousness becomes no-one, and hardly replace the awe Benny could have felt at visiting Babylon.But in the long run, or walk, this book is still well worth reading, and I'm glad I entered the Benny series to find it.	2001-08-03

On the one hand, as a sequel to a story older than a sizeable segment of Doctor Who fandom, it's a success. Messingham takes themes and fugues from the seed story and spins an entirely new tale, set 2000 years into &quot;Planet of Evil&quot;'s future. On that level, Zeta Major is fresh and original (though it helps that he gets to work with the strong ideas planted by Louis Marks in the original).  Further, the events within Planet of Evil itself are given literal apotheosis - dialogue from the original story, is quoted as literal chapter and verse. On the other hand, Zeta Major is Dark, capital D. It's also Grim, and Nasty. Cynical. Twisted. Gritty. After thirty pages, I found this intriguing. After a hundred and fifty pages, I was exhilirated. At the end,  I was... bored. There's only so far you can take the dystopian approach with a fictional civilization without having something to say, and ultimately, Messingham has little new to tell us about our own Y2K ciilization. While there's a novelty to the increasingly gruesome death scenes, and energy in the satiric riffs at Roman Catholicism and the Mafia (this book predates &quot;The Sopranos), at the end of the day, one can't be blamed for feeling somewhat ill-used.While this is a Fifth Doctor adventure, the Doctor on the printed page is hard to swallow without accompanying sips of televised Peter Davison stories viewed in between readings. Tegan and Nyssa are relevant to the plot - Nyssa's print potential has always been unlimited - but Zeta Major could have been written for any other team of companions and Doctor. The book doesn't suffer as a result of the generic characterizations, though - there's far too much else to worry about.	2001-08-03

American and the Soviet Union are on the brink of nuclear war.  Armies of suspicious spies and pandering politicians on both sides are poised at each other's throats, and only ONE MAN -- or is he more than a man? -- can save the world's children.<br />*stumbling drunk clatters through doors*<br />&quot;It's me!  The Doc-- *hic* Doctor!  Doctor Who!&quot;.<br />&quot;Endgame&quot; is Terrance Dicks's first Eighth Doctor novel since the much-maligned &quot;Eight Doctors&quot;, and it also comes at a critical moment in the &quot;Caught On Earth&quot; Arc.  It's 1951, and the Doctor is halfway through his exile.  He's living an increasingly insular existence, and only a set of Hitchcockian circumstances (or perhaps he's just &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;'s Dude) can lure him out of hiding so that he can save the world.<br />Uncle Terry plays this one solely for laughs.  Obviously.  In this one, the President of the United States is &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; (as opposed to Harry S Truman, the historical figure), and every time he appears, he's described by some character or other as &quot;One tough son of a gun&quot; (so to speak).  Josef Stalin drinks a lot of vodka.  One of the British spies, Guy Burgess, is evidently played by American comedian Jon Lovitz in full-on &quot;Master Thespian&quot; mode.<br />As usual from Uncle Terry, the chapters are short, and littered with casual barbs and flashes of insight so quick you might miss them.  Some scenes threaten greatness, and almost deliver.  This is the first Eighth Doctor novel since &quot;Demontage&quot; played mostly for laughs -- so it's fitting that the author of that book, Justin Richards, now editor of the line, penned a few lengthy scenes for this one when it was submitted late and under word count (by the author's own testimony).<br />Otherwise, what you see is what you get.  &quot;Endgame&quot; is 99.44% fluff and saccharine, albeit delivered by an expert tale-teller and string-puller.  It can be finished in a matter of hours, and you're likely to want to stumble around re-enacting some of the more slapstick scenes for a few days afterward.  Just don't emulate the copy-editing, which is some of the worst we've ever seen in a &quot;Who&quot; novel.  And don't re-enact Guy Burgess's scenes... he wins the award for Most Inebriated Character in &quot;Who History&quot;.  Just realize... it'll be a LONG time before we see another book like this in the EDA line.  As the fictional &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; might say to his author, &quot;I reckon the buck stops here!&quot;	2001-08-03

I've come to expect short books with 200 pages of terrific writing, and 40 pages of a haphazard sloppy conclusion which has the feel of something written on a newspaper in an airport barber shop.<br />&quot;The Turing Test&quot; also comes at a critical time -- it's the third book of the Caught-On-Earth arc.  Our Doctor, memory gone, friends gone, TARDIS inoperable, has been stranded for 45 years, and is only just beginning to piece together that he's not human.  It's Leonard's task to portray the Doctor's first escape attempt -- and also the first appearance of bona-fide outer space aliens since this arc began.  Oh, and it's World War II.<br />On the face of it, then, this is a book that needs heavy Doctor involvement -- it's the first serious wrinkle to the character of this tabula rasa Doctor we've had over the past few books.  But Leonard chooses to tell the story from the point of three real-life narrators -- Alan Turing, Graham Greene, and Joseph Heller -- each of whom tell a bit and piece of the story before dying, and then pass the tale to the next author.<br />This is classic Paul Leonard on two grounds -- he gets to kill characters off, *and* he gets to leave a story unfinished not just once, but two times over in the same book!  I was dreading the final Joseph Heller segment, but to my surprise and delight, this is the best of all, the most manic writing and (arguably) the most sensible standpoint of the three narrators.  This portion I finished in one night.  The Graham Greene section felt like a slight letdown -- the narrative POV didn't seem as careful (or intentionally careless) as the Heller or Turing bits.  I'm also leery of reading the memoir of someone who's about to take his own life -- the Turing chapters are seemingly dictated in his final hours, and the endless self-deprecation seems intrusive -- but on the whole these chapters are a good way to begin the tale.<br />The Doctor's final revelation -- that, like Li Hsen Chang, and so many other stooges and collaborators we saw in TV &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, he's been duped and left behind, and that he now must become less selfish -- is really quick and glossed over.  Fortunately, this &quot;off-screen&quot; realization is in keeping with the rest of the book, so it's a forgivable sin.<br />Some of the endless recitations on religion and morality and, even worse, science, are rubbish.  So is the final segment, with our heroes playing out a silly fantasy as Dresden burns.  But it's well-written, fast-moving rubbish.  Maybe I won't dread the final chapters of Paul Leonard's next book.	2001-07-31
US	51345392	R3D1OLQY0VSAPO	1575001438	688305496	Survivor : The Ultimate Game	Books	3	2	2	N	N	A beach story, with no color photos?	&quot;Survivor&quot; the book is not your typical TV tie-in.  It's got no color photographs, no pictures from the show or maps of the island where it was filmed.  Basically if you haven't slavishly watched every episode of the show (fortunately for the book, most people did), the book will be nearly useless.  Not once does it match the names of the contestants to their faces.  Indeed, all the cast photos are candid black-and-white shots, and a couple of them don't even resemble the subject.<br />Without visual aids, the book relies solely on producer/author Mark Burnett's diary entries, supposedly written &quot;as is&quot; and not edited for content after the show wrapped.  Is Burnett showing off?  Occasionally, a dictionary might help your reading.  His descriptions of certain show set pieces -- immunity challenges and Tribal Council -- are tense and engaging, but tellingly, the descriptions do not always match what aired on TV.  Burnett's observation that a book named &quot;The First SEAL&quot; had been written about contestant Rudy sent me scurrying to Amazon.. where I learned that the book isn't about Rudy at all, it's about someone else.  Named Roy.<br />You have to wonder who Burnett thought his book's potential audience was.  Some passages are very literary, as by Howard Cosell (on Rudy's exit, 4 words:  &quot;And, eventually, he fell&quot;).  As I said, people expecting few words and glossy pictures, may wind up scratching their heads.<br />Also disappointing is the back cover blurb, which promises &quot;expanded treatment of the final Tribal Council&quot;.  Expanded, right -- barely a full page of text.  The promised &quot;in-depth&quot; interview with Richard is a little longer but still seems as if it were conducted while walking briskly through an airport.  At Christmas.<br />Since &quot;Survivor&quot; went off the air, the most interesting followup to the show was not the second series, but the round of lawsuits that followed.  Burnett's book may not shed light on these, but it's an interesting document left behind in the wake of the show's success.  Time may prove the series (and the book) to be at least partly fabricated, but then you can read &quot;Survivor&quot; as a novel, and it works well that way, too.<br />And best of all Nurse Tina, the winner of the second series, isn't mentioned.  Not even once.	2001-07-29

After 65 pages and a 2-month break from reading, I fretted that calling it &quot;Casualties of Bore&quot; seemed too obvious to elicit even a smile.<br />Luckily, I returned to the book and now I'm happy to give it high marks. &quot;Casualties&quot; takes DW touchstones such as World War I and mindless zombies (think Toy Soldiers, Human Nature, and Theatre of War, good sources all) and rewrites them in an original, unpredictable way.<br />This Doctor, fresh off a year of excesses in the Faction Paradox arc, is streamlined and amnesiac, with only the stray continuity reference or &quot;Terminator&quot; quote to guide him. He doesn't just recite Shakespeare -- he'll perform an entire play on command, with manic intensity. He'll seem to fall in love, but vanish without a trace, making friends easily, but seemingly unwilling to keep them.<br />The three main supporting characters -- Briggs, Cromby, and Mary, are unique in DW that they all survive the book. Cromby's private battles against the mud men are increasingly funny and it's good to see him win at the end of the day -- in most other books, this guy is cannon fodder by Chapter 10.<br />There are lots of other characters who show up briefly and then vanish, but at least manage to shine when they're around. The late-night conversation between two nurses, apropos of nothing, rings true to life. This is good.<br />A word on the prose. Way, way too many adjectives. And adverbs. And sentence fragments. But at least the prose is internally consistent and allows for some decent POV tricks. One chapter ends with Cromby, Briggs and Mary staring at the same horrific sight -- Emmerson shows us what all 3 characters think, in successive passages. All in all &quot;Casualties&quot;'s prose manages to linger with the reader, and is thus above-average for this kind of book.<br />The plot has holes, and it shows. I was never sure if the dead soldiers were actual corpses, or made entirely of primordial mud, or some combination of both. The coda about the flu epidemic seems misplaced. Every third passage ends with either a cocked pistol or a blinding white light --. Private Corey reminds Emma of &quot;her brother&quot;, and yet she falls in love with him. Yay.<br />Still, &quot;Casualties of War&quot; surpasses &quot;The Burning&quot; in terms of plot, character, and writing style. The Doctor may no longer know who he is, but at least he has things to tell us still.	2001-07-26

Not a single one of the baseball games he played in still exists on videotape.  He never saw action in a World Series game.  By the end of his career as a ballplayer (variously for the Brooklyn Dodgers, Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, Washington Senators, and Boston Red Sox), Berg plaed so infrequently, you might think him the Bartleby of baseball.  When asked to play, the occasional second game of a doubleheader, he preferred not to.  So he sat on the bench.<br />As Nicholas Dawidoff portrays him, Berg was a bizarre man who spent the final 25 years of his life essentially homeless, living off the charity of friends and family, trading his stories of pre-war baseball and wartime espionage for the offer of clean clothes, hot meals, and warm water for a bath.  Trained in the law, and a skilled linguist who spoke half a dozen languages, he refused all employment, apart from the rare consulting job or intelligence mission.<br />While most print accounts of Berg make extravagant claims about his World War II espionage, Dawidoff boils everything down to what he can find on paper from the CIA (and its precursor agencies).  The truth, as reported here, is that Berg's probing of German atomic secrets in 1945 was vital to the war effort, but that he hardly ever worked as a spy again.  He simply pretended to be one, while remaining cloaked in an increasingly insular lifestyle.<br />The research for &quot;The Catcher Was a Spy&quot; is impeccable.  Dawidoff interviewed hundreds of sources, and as a result the book's index is clogged with famous names -- athletes or otherwise (not too many other books quote both Ted Williams and Albert Einstein).  However, most sources knew Berg only tangentially, and I spent a lot of time flipping back and forth to the index and the (extensive) footnotes to keep track of who was saying and thinking each particular passage.<br />The end result is a finely detailed psychoanalysis of Moe Berg, who passed away more than 20 years before this biography was written.  Lots of secondary sources (and their opinions, in many cases, of a man they met for 2 or 3 days, half a century previous) are cited, as are many of Berg's private journals and letters.  What no-one knows, however, including the author himself, is what Moe Berg really thought.  Therefore Dawidoff spents a lot of time telling us what &quot;Berg must have known&quot;, or &quot;would have believed&quot;.  For example, Berg was a non-practicing Jew who rarely mentioned the Holocaust, and Dawidoff is forced to fill in the gaps with auhorial speculation.  Other speculations (on homosexuality, death by poisoning, and child molestation) seem forced or unnecessary.<br />&quot;The Catcher Was A Spy&quot; is often heavy going, as it seems to require equal knowledge of baseball, nuclear physics, and abnormal psychology.  I found the account of Berg's postwar meanderings to be the most exciting material, although I wish these had been arranged chronologically rather than geographically.  On the whole, I recommend the book, and wish that Berg had left behind a completed biography of his own.  He had so many stories to tell.	2001-07-22

I was interested in seeing his sometimes-technical take on baseball applied to the great teams of the past, whereas co-author Eddie Epstein I knew not at all.<br />&quot;Baseball Dynasties&quot; is on its face an examination of 15 of the greatest baseball teams ever, ranging from the deadball-era 1906 Cubs, to the &quot;Team of the Century&quot; 1998 Yankees.  It's longer and more detailed than most commercially-available &quot;best teams ever&quot; books, and probably the first one I've seen that's not aimed at kids.  &quot;Dynasties&quot; is equal part historical research and statistical argument and, depending on where your interests lie, some parts of the book will be more interesting than others.<br />Neyer's sidebars and sidesteps tend to be the freshest.  The historical research shows best in the articles with his name attached.  His game recounts are fresh, his player biographies are original.  The 1906 and 1912 World Series summaries come to life in a way that makes you believe Roger Angell was actually there and sending back reports.  He's the first author I've ever seen detail just who Walter Beall was, beyond the fact that he pitched one inning for the 1927 Yankees.<br />Neyer, and mostly Epstein, use the Standard Deviation of a team's runs scored and runs allowed, to compare the great teams of different eras. They never tell us how &quot;SD&quot; is calculated, so those of us with adding machines can't play along at home -- I neglected to take statistics in college but love calculating ERAs and Pythagorean theorems as much as the next baseball nut.  I won't blame them for my math shortcomings but they did promise to provide the formula at an early point in the book.<br />Epstein's portions are less interesting.  His prose is dry and peevish.  His elaborate defenses of Reggie Jackson and Davey Johnson seem unnecessary, his use of the data unoriginal.  Boldly proclaiming that a batter with 563 career HRS and 10 different playoff appearances is &quot;productive&quot;, strikes of myopia.  Worst of all is his discounting of postseason games, and in spite of his saying &quot;Games are not played on paper&quot;, he's still trying to reopen the books on the 1969 World Series.<br />Another of the book's rare missteps is a sidebar castigating a factual error about the 1986 Mets in Doc Gooden's autobiography.  Fine, fine, but in the same pages Neyer misreports the scores of two playoff games from that same year.<br />On the whole &quot;Baseball Dynasties&quot; is a terrific fit on my baseball bookshelf.  It's more interested in presenting the facts, anecdotes and numbers -- unindexed, it's not a handy reference tool, and is best consulted during slow games or phone conversations with friends.  Their final rankings of the 15 teams seems desultory -- they reach a logical but unsexy result I've seen argued in other books -- but when it comes to teams such as these, any answer is the &quot;right&quot; answer.	2001-07-22

This, the David Cone story, is Angell's first baseball &quot;bio&quot;, so to speak, and it helps to have a strong working knowledge of David Cone's career before you begin.  And yet if you go in expecting 300 pages of nothing but Cone, you may have trouble navigating Angell's short trips and side steps around the game he loves so much.<br />Angell's biggest strength, at least as I've always read him, lies in his descriptions of games and players.  David Cone started some of the more memorable ballgames of the past decade, and Angell's game summaries are magnetic.  I like the poetic way in which he visualizes players.  Even the cameo by former Cone teammate Terry Leach becomes grand opera in the Angell tradition (&quot;[he] made right-handed batters bend and weave like matadors.&quot;).<br />Equally fascinating are Angell's musings on the Yankees' frustrating 2000 season, and his attempts to solve a knotty baseball trivia question involving certain members of the 400 homer club (key hint: Cone is not a member).<br />Angell also loves technical descriptions, of the way pitches break and of the way Cone's right arm functions (or malfunctions).  These are the paragraphs that held less of my interest -- but that's Angell's key asset.  He looks at baseball from every angle, and writes something for everyone.  You may even find yourself, like Angell, reaching for a baseball to see if you, too, can throw the Laredo.<br />David Cone is lucky to have found such a biographer as this.  His career and his mentality deserve more than the standard cut-and-paste job, and this is a book to be proud of.  Best, it's a loving book about the 2000 Yankees, as written by a Mets fan.  One feels Angell's turmoil as Piazza pops up to second base to end the fifth inning of Game 4 (Cone fans know of what I speak), and yet this out is the book's climax, a moment of quiet triumph.<br />I wish &quot;A Pitcher's Story&quot; had received better ratings.  It's as absorbing a baseball book as has been written this year, and instilled in me a craving to rush back to my long-untouched tapes of the 1996 World Series, when Coney was king.  It's a book best read out loud, perhaps with the radio on and tuned in to a Boston Red Sox game this season.  Cone fans wil know of what I speak.	2001-07-11

US	51345392	R14J71UCZXGDUH	0345332245	810756753	SEARCH FOR THE DOCTOR (Dr. Who-Find Your Fate, No 1)	Books	1	6	7	N	N	A Search Best Left Abandoned	A quick cheap paperback written to cash in on two unique mid-1980s American phenomena -- the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; books, and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.<br />(By way of introduction, The &quot;Find Your Fate&quot; series seems to fetishize action-adventure heroes.  The ads at the back of &quot;Search for the Doctor&quot; advertise similar &quot;Find Your Fate&quot; stories featuring G.I. Joe and James Bond.  These were written by R.L. &quot;Goosebumps&quot; Stine, to boot.)<br />&quot;Search&quot; is authored (in the loosest sense of the word) by David Martin, who wrote several DW TV adventures in the '70s.  It also makes no sense.  From Los Angeles in the year 2056 (why?), to a space lab called &quot;FERN&quot; (indee), to the return of villains from two different Martin-penned DW serials (all the better with which to lure first-time readers, no doubt), &quot;Search&quot; is a boring and confusing morass.  The Doctor is hardly to be seen, there's hardly any decision-making to be had, and the story only has one successful conclusion.<br />Basically, as both a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure, and as a Doctor Who story, &quot;Search for the Doctor&quot; fails gloriously.  It's easy to see why they didn't print too many more of these.  And why copies are so hard to find.  If you should see one, save your fifty cents and call your mom instead.	2001-07-05

This certainly is one of them!  The stories found here suffer from sameness... most are about 25 pages in length and lack the punchy, final impact that would highlight a superior short story collection.  Most Doctors get featured twice; many of the writers have never been heard from, before or since this collection came out.  While original concepts are to be treasured in full-length DW novels, ironically More Short Trips work best when gazing inward, at past DW adventures: &quot;Return of the Spiders&quot; is best in the collection, followed by &quot;Romans Cutaway&quot;.  The Doctor-less stories, which could have been special, are alas of dubious note:  &quot;The Sow in Rut&quot; is a K-9 &amp; Company adventure, bizarrely played for laughs.  Two short-shorts (&quot;Missing&quot;) examine Mel's departure.  The Nth Doctor story, &quot;Good Companions&quot;, is striking for its portrayal of an older Tegan, while the funny &quot;uPVC&quot; manages to nail both the 2nd and 7th Doctors, each in full caricature.  Maybe that's when Short Trips work best -- light, funny, and continuity-heavy.  Special mention to &quot;64 Carlysle Street&quot;, the beleaguered Gary Russell's best-ever DW work, hilarious and lightning-sharp.  There's not a whole lot here to carry with you into everyday life, but the stories are mildly diverting, and perhaps best read one at a time, in between other BBC novels featuring particular Doctor/companions pairings.	2001-06-20
US	51345392	RQ953VGXMOT3N	0743205405	756073777	Take the Cannoli: Stories From the New World	Books	4	14	16	N	N	Too Short	&quot;Take the Cannoli&quot; is a short collection of essays by Sarah Vowell, mostly printed elsewhere before being compiled here.  Emphasis on &quot;short&quot;.  The title article obviously takes its cue from &quot;The Godfather&quot;, and I came to the end wishing that the book had been as long as the movie.  Vowell's organized the essays by general subject, starting with the autobiographical, lingering heavily on the travelogue, and ending with reflections on her own music collection (back to the autobiographical, then).  Taken all together there's not much of a start-to-finish personal journey here (Vowell is not, after all, Michael Corleone), but the places and reflections she shows us along the way are all worth remembering.  Best essay in the book follows the Trail of Tears, as the author ruminates on her own part-Cherokee Indian heritage.  Overall, I spent a couple of weeks dipping into and out of Sarah Vowell's life and now I can say I'd like to have read more than the barely 220 pages we're given.	2001-06-17
