Plans set out thousands of years before have finally come to fruitation with the arrival of the massive living ship, Tiamat.  <br /> <br />This begins a change in the hybrids, specifically the Barons, Sam, and the Quad V hybrids. <br /> <br />The old god-kings and their personal soldiers have been reborn. Enlil, supreme leader of the Annunaki and the council of nine are back to reclaim their previous kingdoms. <br /> <br />So much so that they've abandoned their old Baronies, seeing them as totally useless in the schemes they have planned for the world.  <br /> <br />That's the plot in a nutshell.  <br /> <br />In this novel, the reader is given - very clearly - the emotions and the reactions of the main characters.  There is no longer any reason for authors other than Mr. Ellis to `misinterpret' how a character acts or reacts.  <br /> <br />Domi isn't a sex-crazed maniac. Grant isn't Kane's yes Man. Brigid Baptist isn't a motherly member of the `ya-ya sisterhood. <br /> <br />Each character shines in their strength and weaknesses in the novel, and more than ever do you see the friendship and the feelings that exist not only between the main characters, but the supporting characters like Bry, Philboyd and even Decard.  <br /> <br />Respect is shown, and it's earned. It's not demanded among the characters. <br /> <br />With the massive changes that have taken place in this book, things are no longer what they might seem. Old enemies might become allies. Entire vistas can be explored in a way that they couldn't with the old series. <br /> <br />Once again, it's all because of the severing of ties with the founding series.  <br /> <br />With each new novel written by Mr. Ellis, the reader will see how he originally intended to write the series, but due to formulas and rules, he wasn't able to full exploit. <br /> <br />I just hope that he'll stick with the series, or if and when he finally does leave, that GE will have enough foresight to bring in a writer who'll continue on in the tradition that Mr. Ellis is setting up with it, instead of using staff writers who're only interested in receiving a paycheck, instead of putting the effort that the mythology and universe that Mr. Ellis created deserves.	2005-05-13
US	51028243	R3LCTIBVX3KYBK	0373638450	288219814	Evil Abyss (Outlanders)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A tip of the hat to an old friend	The latest Outlanders offering is a bit of a switch from Mark's usual fare, as I will describe later in the review.  <br /> <br /> It's good to see him back at the helm, after the less than adequate offerings we've had over the past year, with the exception of Mask of the Sphinx. <br /> <br /> Instead of the usual save the world from a dreaded evil, it's quite a simple story. It starts out with Brigid Baptiste, Philboyd and a woman named Nora testing out the latest Interphaser device. They end up arriving in a small temple in Cambodia, where they're separated and each person ends up in a different faction's camp. <br /> <br /> Of course, each faction has its own agenda, with only Philboyd being the one threatened with death.  <br /> <br /> Grant and Domi both wish to come with Kane on the rescue mission to help the three of them, but Kane pulls off a fast one, taking one of the Mantas without letting either of them know of his plans. It's a one-man rescue mission this time.  <br /> <br /> Upon arrival, the Manta crash lands after all the power is knocked from it, and he meets up with some of the locals.  <br /> <br /> With their help, he joins forces with a General named Zhou Tzu and agrees, albeit reluctantly, to help him fulfill his destiny, as well as to rescue his friends. It turns out that Nora has fallen for the general, and he for her in return, and clearly has no interest in returning to Cerberus.  <br /> <br /> Working together, they are able to locate Brigid Baptiste and Philboyd, and rescue the latter.  <br /> <br /> During the rescue attempt, they inadvertently get involved in yet another revolt, and reunite the General with his daughter, the ruler of the city-state.  <br /> <br /> For anyone who happens to be a fan of the old I Spy TV series from the 60's, they will find that this novel is very similar to one of the episodes called \\"Warlord\\". The book is even dedicated to Robert Culp, who was the star of this series.  I found the General had a great deal in common with the character that Mr. Culp portrayed in the episode.  <br /> <br /> What also sets this novel apart from the rest of the series is that instead of having the usual pattern of Kane, Grant and Brigid heading out on a mission together, they are all separated. Hell, even Domi and Grant have less a role to play than usual in the novel.  <br /> <br /> This might put off some people, but I personally found it to be a refreshing change from the usual method we've all become so used to over the years the series has been running.  <br /> <br /> Also, it's nice to have a novel once in a while that isn't earth shattering in it's scope, like we've been given time and again.  <br /> <br /> That is coming in the next novel.  <br /> <br /> Finally, as you would expect, with the novel having been written by Mark Ellis, the characters are dead on target once again.  <br /> <br /> Unlike previous novels we've been subjected to.	2005-02-21
US	51028243	R3FV3P1W59CFWY	0060580666	65418970	Sandstorm (Sigma Force)	Books	5	2	5	N	N	A perfect example of how to write adventure	Sandstorm has all the elements, which make a novel a pleasure to read. You have well developed characters - who have both their strengths and their weaknesses, not to mention actual personalities.  <br /> <br />You don't have the typical cardboard hero that you see in so many pulp novels and so called adventure series. Sure, some of the characters, at first, seem to be your typical clich's but as the novel progresses, you understand why they act and react the way they do. In many ways, that eliminates the 'damsel in distress', the 'daring adventurer', the 'stout soldier', the 'villainous vixen', and breaths life into these all so typical two-dimensional figures.  <br /> <br />In the end, you come to care for them, and don't want to see harm befall them.  <br /> <br />Next, you have the adventure. The novel starts out with a literal bang, and it only grows from there. Attempts at assassination, disappearing desert women, and attacks on the open ocean - you get the picture.  <br /> <br />To top it off, you have the events that shape the world in which the characters are set, and even the locations are exotic, exciting, and global spanning.  <br /> <br />The adventure spans the globe from the US, to Briton, all the way to the Arabian Peninsula, both the antagonists and protagonists traveling by air, sea, land, and even under the desert itself, visiting historical locations and places that hold great significance to the major religions of these regions.  <br /> <br />Finally, you have the science behind the novel. It's hard to imagine the work Mr. Rollins put into this latest effort, but it paid off. It was clear that he researched Anti-matter, Buckyballs, how the earth creates more water, and then there are the Rahim, a very fascinating tribe.  <br /> <br />As any fan of James Rollins would expect, there are some very surprising twists to his latest offering, one that surprised even a jaded reader such as myself, and it's this very reason that I continue to purchase his novels once they hit the stores and devour them as quickly as I can, without losing any of the pleasure one gets from reading a well done novel.  <br /> <br />Keep them coming!	2004-07-29

Someone who can take an old, tried and worn out storyline and add enough twists and exotic locations to make it not only worthwhile reading, but memorable too boot. <br />The novel begins on the Manitius base, located on the moon. Here the survivors who have not yet made their way to Cerberus are guarding over the body of the last of the Tuatha Du Danaan, Maccan. <br />The reader quickly discovers that not all the base personnel are what they seem. There are still a number of men and women loyal to Maccan, and are simply waiting for the right time to revive him. <br />Now is better than never. <br />Grant, Kane and Brigid are off on the East coast, attempting to make a deal with a Pit Boss for weapons and ordinance he smuggled out of the Tartarus pits. As one can imagine, it turned out to be a trap, but one which ended up costing the lives and even more Deathbirds, while Kane and his companions made it away with nary a scratch. <br />In Cerberus, Lakesh is spending time with Domi, and most of the base personnel are just relaxing and living their lives. <br />Their peaceful little world came crashing down around them incredibly fast. Maccan invades the redoubt, his people causing extensive damage and killing a large number of the refugees from the Manitius base. He has two demands, one being that Lakesh accompany him, the other that the scientists bring along his interphaser. <br />Maccan has some interesting plans for the device. At first, Lakesh has no desire to help the Mad God, but after he tortures Domi, and puts her in a coma from which it is uncertain if she will awaken or not, Lakesh gives in. <br />Not so much as to save more lives, as he couldn't stand to lose Domi. <br />He, as well as the Interphaser, are taken and the surviving members of Maccan's invading force use the gateway and leave the base. <br />When Kane and his friend return to the base, they quickly discover the extent of the damage, and are able to track the jump location, where Maccan took Lakesh and the device. <br />He has made a trip to Mars. <br />None of them are all that eager to return to the red, barren planet, as they have no idea what sort of trap, if any - Maccan has left behind for them. However, the safe return of their friend is far more important, and they push any doubt and fear they have to the backgrounds of their minds and make the jump. <br />Upon returning to Mars, they briefly encounter more Transadapts, but they're more of an annoyance than an actual danger. <br />They find out that Maccan has taken Lakesh to the monument pyramid, and take the Martian bullet train to the huge monolith. The fight on the train against Maccan's people is very well written, and one could see the Cerberus warriors exchanging weapons fire against the fast moving sleds, piloted by Maccan's loyalists. <br />But, compared to the interior of the great pyramid itself, that is nothing more than a walk in the park. It was as if one was actually inside the huge structure, feeling not only the immeasurable weight of the stone the pyramid was built out of pushing down on you, but the weight of the passage of time as well. <br />Inside the monument, Maccan's forces capture Kane and his friends and they are taken to Lakesh. <br />A short period of time later, they're all taken deep into the pyramid, where they learn Maccan's plans, and even more fascinating, what happened to the Tuatha and their origins. <br />Maccan plans on using the Interphaser in conjunction with the Pyramid to cross the dimensions and return to his peoples own universe and world, and he intends on taking the Cerberus warriors with him. <br />Brigid sabotages his plans however, and in doing so, quite literally brings down the house around the Mad god. <br />As I stated at the beginning of my review, the story is as old as time, but when you mix characters you actually care about, locate them in exotic settings and throw in an insane alien who considers himself to be a god - you have the makings of a hell of a read. <br />The recapping of material wasn't quite as overbearing as it has been over the past couple of years, although it is still annoying, and it could potentially turn older readers away. But, to be honest, that would be the reader's loss. It is necessary from time to time to have recapping, as to fill in the newcomers to the series. <br />Once again the author has proven that he knows his science. The theories and technology mentioned in the novel are not just random bits of fluff pulled out of the air, but actual theories put forth in the scientific community, backed by research. <br />This is what sets Outlanders apart from many other novels, and the original series that spawned it. <br />Combine that with written descriptions that could stimulate even the most obtuse and un-imaginative minds, you have a winner, and once again, the author has proven that he is more than just your average writer. <br />Many authors making a great deal more for their work could learn a thing or two from this author.	2004-02-09

That's when it appears that Kane goes rogue, and ends up imprisoning Lakesh, and allowing Sindri to go free. <br />The novel has a number of difficult branches to follow, mainly involving Sam's plans for the future. Then there is the doomsday cult that wants to bring about total destruction of reality, bring on blessed entropy, an end to everything, lead by none other than BOTH Erica van Sloan and Baron Beausoleil.<br />The Author has really shaken things up with the novel. After reading it, the reader is left to wonder - will Lakesh betray the exiles, either intentionally or un-intentionally? Will said man hook up with the Dragon lady, Erica?<br />Will Kane finally stop being pig headed and admit how deeply he cares for Brigid, and visa versa? Will they finally get married, like they did in Talon and Fang?<br />Will they get another Manta to replace the one that had been shot down over India, in an attempt, which appeared to have been successful; to thwart Sam the Imperators plans for world domination?<br />What twists and turns does the author have planned for the future of the series?  What can we expect from him?  Considering how the series and the characters have changed over the past couple of years, you can rest assured that whatever he has planned, it's nothing that any of us would expect, and that it will be earth shattering in both magnitude, and how it effects the world that he has created. <br />I would be as bold to say that none of the other current writers working for GE could even come close to what he has achieved. If they could, then all of GE's series would end up being best sellers. <br />What can we expect?<br />Only time, and the author, will tell.	2003-09-23

To any new readers to the series, it'll be very confusing if they pick up the older novels after reading this one. <br />Mark has written a novel that is very emotional, tragic, but touching and out and out uproariously funny in several sections. <br />It begins almost thirty years into the future. The entire face of the Outlands has been changed, much to the efforts of the Cerberus exiles. <br />Sam has taken total control of the continent, and a good part of the world as well. The nine baronies were destroyed completely in a five year war that took place after Cobalt managed to rebuild his power base and launched an all out assault against Cerberus. <br />Kane, Grant, Lakesh and Bry are the only ones who managed to survive the wars. Both Kane and Grant were instrumental in the victory over the nine barons, but the cost to both men was insurmountable. <br />Grant lost Shizuak, and Kane lost his wife, Brigid, when they rescued him from the hands of a cult, The Nirodha, based in India. That single even left more of a scar on Kane than any of the wounds that he had suffered over the many years he spent as a Magistrate, and then an exile fighting the Barons. <br />He has spent over twenty years researching a means to travel back in time to fix what had happened, so that he wouldn't have to suffer as he has. Even Grant, his partner, and his best friend, turned his back on Kane, thinking that he has become totally fused out because of what happened. <br />Kane however, has a plan. Sindri disappeared, and was never heard from again, but Kane realized what the little man did. He managed to trap himself in Zero time, using the operation Chronos facilities on Thunder Isle, just before the reactor reached critical mass. He is critical to bring about Kane's plan to life. <br />As always, Kane has a number of obstacles toovercome. First and foremost is Tanvirah, the daughter of Lakesh and Erica van Sloan. She is now the Scorpio Prime of the Nirodha cult, like her mother before her. She is under Sam's orders to try and win Kane over, with any means at her disposal. Grant even tries to stop him, and the fight that ensues is one of the more entertaining scenes in the novel. <br />But, despite as crazy as he appears, Kane's whole scheme might actually work, and after bringing Sindri back from the Zero time he had been trapped in. Together, he and Sindri use the remaining TAV to travel to the City of High River, formerly known as Cobaltville. <br />Surpassing even more trials and tribulations, they reach the city only to be captured and whisked off to China where they would face Sam, the Imperator. <br />Here, Kane confronts the hybrid and discovers exactly who and what he is, and during the confrontation, he learns the Imperators great plans. His own plan to send Sindri back in time actually succeeds, but at the cost of his life. <br />Once again, this is the best novel that the author has written to date, and I am very eager to read the conclusion.	2003-06-21

There is plenty of action, to be sure, but at the same time, there is even more character development, which compliments the action quite beautifully.<br />The novel begins with Kane and Domi hunting for a prehistoric monster on Thunder Isle, to make the violent and primordial island just a little bit safer for the Cerberus exiles, while they explore the ruins of the Operation Chronos facility. <br />The author gives even more depth to the outlander girl, Domi, and adds a little tension between her and Kane, as she makes it quite clear that she is interested in him, despite the relationship that has blossomed between her and Lakesh, after Grant rejected her. <br />Speaking of the ebony giant, he has decided to leave Cerberus, as he is tired of all the fighting and the near endless stress that he's been subjected to. He really doesn't believe that it's his fight, and he just wants to retire, to settle down with Shizuka and the Tigers of Heaven on new Edo. <br />Another old enemy has apparently arisen from the grave, a man we haven't seen since Iceblood. He managed to find his way to Utlima Thule, a haven of Vikings that has remained essentially untouched for thousands of years. Using his influence, he is trying to take over the isolated civilization, and to bring about another great Deluge, not quite of biblical proportions, but one that would destroy the emerging civilization, plunging the already fragile planet back into another dark age, of which it might not ever recover. <br />Zakat and a ship of the people from Ultima Thule raid a ship belonging to the Tigers of Heaven, all the while being witnessed by Grant and his new love.  That prompts him to return to Cerberus to ask for Kane's help in tracking down the criminal and putting an end to him and his plans once and for all. <br />Bringing Philboyd with them, they jump to the gateway that was first discovered in Hell Rising. They find the entrance to Ultima Thule and make their way to the underground city. It is very much a lost civilization, even though the Nazi's tried to take it over nearly 250 years previously.  Tried, but failed miserably, and paid for their efforts with their lives. <br />Here, Kane is forced to fight Zakat's lover, a Valkyrie named Sif. It is truly a memorable battle, one which Kane nearly loses his life, but as is the case, the hero triumphs, and not only defeats the woman, but spares her life. Zakat meets his end in a very appropriate manner, and the threat to the world is neatly dealt with.<br />Keep them coming!	2003-04-20

They need a rest,<BR>a break from saving not only humanity, but the world, and, in the case of the Dragon<BR>King's, the whole solar system. <br />As people have come to expect with the series, the book is about change, and quite<br />significant changes at that, which will be mentioned below. <br />The novel begins in the Australian Outback, at a base that has been constructed inside<BR>a powerful natural energy location, that has been worshipped by the Aboriginals since time<BR>immorial. The aboriginals are not at all pleased with the intrusion, and make their displeasure<BR>known to Sam's forces. <br />Kane and Grant are testing out the air to surface capabilities of the Manta craft, which they<BR>have taken from the moonbase. They attack AREA 51, and end up destroying a number of<BR>Magistrates. They're quite happy with the way the craft perform.<br />It is here that Grant informs Kane that he's leaving, to go to New Edo to be with the woman<BR>who's captured his heart. This is just the first of the major changes occuring in the <BR>series. <br />Cerberus is changing as well. Survivors from the moonbase are starting to trickle back Earth,<BR>and are taking up residence in the redoubt. For the first time in years, new personnel are<br />walking the halls of the base. Kane and Grant, especially Kane, is something of a legend<BR>amoung the newcomers, not only because of saving the entire Solar system, but <BR>the fact that he went toe to toe with Maccan and not only survived, but defeated the<BR>last Danaan.<br />Things are tense between Kane and Quavell. He uses any excuse that he can to stay away<BR>from her.<br />Grant brings Shizuka with him back to Cerberus, to meet with the personel,yet another <BR>change taking place.<br />The original idea was to return to the moonbase to get the medical equipment they needed<BR>to help Quavell during her pregnancy, and this leads not only to her kidnapping, but it also<BR>incapacitates both Kane and Grant, leaving the rescue mission up to Brigid, Domi and <BR>Shizuka. <br />Despite the tension between Domi and Shizuka, they travel to the Outback, using <BR>Lakesh's Phase Transducer.   During the voyage, they encounter the Dreamtime, and <BR>when they awaken, they're guests of the Aboriginals, who attacked Sam's base.<br />While she is captive, a great deal is learned about Quavell, and the hybrids as well,<BR>including the fact that Quavell had a human lover before Kane, and the other humans <BR>who were forced into 'service' at Cobalts demand. <br />With their help, they are able to infiltrate the facility, locate and rescue Quavell. <br />As I mentioned earlier, there are a significant number of changes to the series, many of<BR>which are going to have long term effects as the series goes on. <br />Keep the changes coming, all that can happen is more and more readers get attracted to the series, as long as they're done properly, and the time is taken to introduce said changes, without just throwing them at the readers with little to no explination!	2002-12-17

This time, they save the entire solar system. <br />Dragoneye picks up exactly where Devil in the Moon left off. <br />Kane and co. are inside an ancient moonbase, constructed a millinea before.<br />Their mission was originally to explore the moonbase, as it seemed that is where Megaera and her furies had originated. <br />As it tends to happen, the whole mission paramater changed, rather quickly. <br />The author has, as usual, bound together mythology and conspiracy into a well thought out storyline. <br />The last of the Annunaki, Enki, is in charge of Magaera and the Furies, while the last of the Tuatha De Danaan, Maccan, is in charge of a separate group, who have been at odds since almost the time of the Skydark. <br />Things are not as they appear. Maccan, the last of the Danaan appears to be completely insane, and yet, has moments where he is lucid enough to actually explain a great deal of the history between his people, and the reptillian Annunaki. <br />It appears at first that Enki might be some sort of monster, but the way he's portrayed is quite the opposite. <br />Without going further into it, and revealing more of the plotline, it appears that at least one of these two entities recieves badly needed redemption. <br />A large number of new characters are introduced in this novel, including several that will become regulars, as they are joining the exiles in the Cerberus redoubt. <br />On top of the author finally compiling in it's nearly complete form, the history of not only the Archon's, but that of the Danaan and the Annunaki, we have a story that involves high tech weaponry, horror, and even a space borne dog-fight, ending with the salvation of the entire solar system. <br />And, it was stated that the home world of the Annunaki is currently, series time, located near Jupiter. <br />The potential storylines that arise from that tidbit of information is mind-boggling. <br />A great ending to a two part storyline, most worthy of the Outlanders title. <br />A must read.	2002-08-10

Not only has the cover art changed, but many other factors as well.<br />First and foremost is that the Cerberus Exiles now have a new means of getting around the Outlands. Instead of relying almost exclusively on the Mat-trans unit, using technology developed in Savage Sun. It is an Interphaser, using the earth's natural jump points to get around. <br />Secondly, for the most part the old Magistrate armour has been given up and instead they're using the Shadowsuits that were introduced in Tomb of Time. <br />Thirdly, something happens between Lakesh and Domi, but I won't go into details because it would give too much away. <br />Now, the novel has what most people would consider being a great deal of filler. It had to be included though, as essentially the series has, in some aspects, started over again. So, many of the long-term readers might find it repetitive, but in reality, it is NEEDED for all the new readers that are joining with each and every novel. There is also the fact that the continuity had been broken between Purgatory Road with Sargasso Plunder, then between Tomb of Time and Prodical Chalice. Both Sargasso and Chalice were written by a different author, and there was very little in background information provided in either. Thus, the need to not only explain things to new readers, but to 'refresh' the memories of long term fans. <br />The story begins with the Cerberus Exiles arriving on the outskirts of a isolated community, one that started out as an insane asylum. They're promptly forced to return to the colony, where, in only a matter of a few minutes, change it forever. <br />It isn't long after they return to Cerberus that they discover something un-usual happening on the Moon, and it's something that they have to investigate, after they accidentally bring Megaera (introduced in Tomb of Time) during their tests of the Interphaser. <br />After viewing the video of the base, they see something that chills their blood. Another Annunaki. <br />Using the Interphaser, they arrive on the moon, meet up with a group of four survivors who were stationed at the base during the Skydark, and learn more about Megaera and her Furies, and one item that could quite easily destroy the earth that has been stationed in Earth's orbit since the time of the Skyark. <br />The exiles have to travel over the surface of the moon to an ancient moonbase, and there they meet a new menace to humanity.<br />Meanwhile, back at Cerberus redoubt, a VERY unexpected visitor arrives with shocking news. <br />The next novel in the series can't arrive soon enough for my taste.	2002-05-13

It's been said time and again that Domi is NOT Jak Lauren in drag. She doesn't carry a .357 revolver, and the only time she speaks like Jak are in times of great distress or tension. Also, she doesn't carry knives hidden all around her person, and, even though she is somewhat feral, she doesn't take great pleasure in killing people. Those who deserve it, yes, but she's not a blood thirsty little psycho.<br />The editor is MORE To blame than the author for this getting past. The author, I can almost understand. He doesn't know the series. However, the Editor DOES (or at least, is supposed to know) about the characters and it's the editor's job to make sure that mistakes like this are caught and fixed. <br />Next, there was the deal with Slavers in Outlanders. It doesn't fit. That is Deathlands, not Outlanders. The barons have no need to deal with slavers, nor would they when people are willing to DIE to get into the Tartarus pits in the baronies. The Hybrid Baron's do not need slaves with the literal thousands who want the life that the villes could provide to them. <br />If the author wanted to use that, he should have made the slavers going after people so that their organs could be harvested for the Hybrids use. That would have made far more sense with the canon that the series creator has established.<br />As earlier, this can be blamed more on the editor than the author. The editor should have caught and changed that. <br />Lastly, if the author could bottle and market the testoserone that he had prevalent in the book, he wouldn't have to write for a living! The characters were exceptionally hostile, moreso than usual, but at least not towards one another like in the author's last offering. <br />For all the bad, there are good things. I found that Lindstrom was quite an interesting character, and it's a shame that he was killed at the end of the book.<br />Secondly, the past life sequences were well written, if a bit confusing. Being interested in Egypt, I found those sequences particularly enjoying, as well as how the author tied Enlil into the history of that culture. <br />Third, the history aspect is exactly what, as an Outlanders reader would expect it to be. Well written, and documented. I really liked how we have link between Ancient Egypt, The Nazi's and King Arthur, and the Roman's in the novel.<br />High praise for the author in that aspect.<br />This book was far better than his last offering, despite my complaints, and if he can get the characters and the background correct, the books he writes for the series will worthy of the Outlanders title.	2002-04-16

And anyone who has followed the series from the earliest novels will be able to figure out who that is.<br />The novel also reveals who was responsible for saving Domi's life, as described in Purgatory road, although the reasons for the act remain vague, and of course, the reader wanting more. <br />A new character has been introduced as well, a man named Oakshott.  Anyone familiar with English history from the late 1800's early 1900's will quickly realize who he is, thus explaining another myth that has eluded the authorities for many decades. <br />Thunder Isle, introduced in Tigers of Heaven is explored more fully as well, and the Samurai warrior Shizuka is brought back into the series as well. There is a whole new world of possibilities opened up by the return to this island and hopefully they will be fully explored in upcoming novels. <br />The only complaint I have, and it's a small one, is the fact that the novel ended too abruptly.  Too many possibilities were not explored, but can quite easily be touched on in future novels.	2002-02-14

First, there never has been an exile named Collins. Ever. I have no idea where this unknown person came from. Secondly, what security teams? The only security that Cerberus has ever had have been Kane and Grant. Third, who was that un-known person in a white coverall that came to inform Lakesh in one scene?<br />Anyone who has read the series, for more than a couple of novels, know who the exiles are. <br />Now, about Domi. In this book, Domi wasn't Domi, she was Jak Lauren in drag. Throughout the novels, it has become quite clear that the only time she talks in a clipped manner, is during times of exceptional stress. It's not all the time. She was doing that throughout the entire book. Secondly, she doesn't carry a .357. That's Jak Lauren's weapon of choice. <br />Again, anyone who has read the series would know this.<br />Third, the characterization was totally off. Yes, the exiles disagree on a number of subjects, but the underlying FRIENDSHIP has always been there. In this book, everyone was suspicious of one another, especially between Domi and Brigid. That was just plain wrong. They're friends. Brigid would never wonder if Domi had ulterior motives in saving her. <br />While I'm on the topic of Brigid, she isn't Krysty Wroth from Deathlands. She's never expressed any interest in finding a better life and eventually leaving the redoubt, the way that she threatened to do at the end of the novel. <br />Yes, the relationship between Brigid and Kane is strained, but not to the point where they're going to snipe at one another at her bedside. <br />Now, for the novel itself. <br />First, It read like a Deathlands novel. The series has split so far away from Deathlands they can't be compared any more, and most of the readers don't want to see a Deathlands style novel written in Outlanders.<br />Secondly, at the endof Purgatory Road, Cobaltville was under attack from combined forces. There is no way that Cobalt would have the manpower to mount a hunt for a software trader. Hell the way the novel was going, I doubt that Cobalt is even in charge of Cobaltville any longer. <br />This novel was an exceptional letdown, especially after how well written Wreath of Fire was. <br />For the rating, if this was a Deathlands novel, it would have been clearly a five out of five. But Outlanders is NOT Deathlands, and it's clear that all ties to the series are being cut with each novel that comes out. So it deserves the rating I am giving it	2001-09-07

Ray guns? Z-beams? <br />Sorry, Mr. Malony, but you really could have put a lot more thought into it. <br />Unless, of course, that was the intent.<br />There were a few things that just didn't make any sense to me either. I for one, just can't accept the fact that the only intelligent life in the universe is humanity. Considering that there are what, billions of solar systems in our galaxy alone, and even if only one in 1 million systems developed intelligent life, that would mean uncountable lifeforms. <br />That I just can't accept. Maybe others can, but I can't. <br />Also, the names of the systems and cities show a total lack of imagination as well. Dead Gulch? Guam? Big Bright City? I was quite disappointed by that. <br />Characterization was sorely lacking as well. Just rehashed, typical characters that were prominent in the original Wingman series. Nothing that I would consider memorable at all. Even Hawk Hunter seemed too cliche and predictable. <br />Plotwise, if you loved the plots from Wingman, then you'll enjoy the stories. As always, it involves a mysterious group of unknown figures wearing black armor, bent on destroying civilization. They have access to amazing technology and they seem to be pulling off Miracles, and are relentless and dangerous as anything ever encountered, and seemingly unstoppalbe. It will more than likely take a couple of books to get down to who the villian is.<br />Honestly, the name S'Keem, the prince of this massive Empire, is looking like the villian and is behind the mysterious figures that are about to wreak so much havok on the universe.<br />Sorry, but I have to admit that I won't be picking up the rest of the series.	2001-07-30

Once the battle has been waged, a force of Magistrates led by Ramirez attempt to land on the shores.<br />The results are, as you would expect.<br />The book goes into a lot of rehashing of information that has been explained previously, but that in itself is not a bad thing. It gives many of the new readers (and the series is gaining more and more all the time) all the background data they would need to understand what is happening up to that point. <br />The reader is also left wondering what is going to happen to Lakesh, now that he's regained his youth and vigor.  What is going to happen to Domi, did she suffer any adverse side effects to the time trawling?<br />And what of the Isle of Thunder? Who was behind the time trawling experiments?

It begins where Doom Dynasty left off, with Kane in the Clutches of Baron Cobalt in Area 51.  I will not go into the details of what was happening to him, as it would spoil it for the reader.<br />Suffice to say, the reader is treated a rare glimpse into the mind and society of the Hybrid race, how they react, their views on humanity and each other, emotions, etc. <br />While Kane is held captive, Grant, Brigid as well as a small team of natives leave the Darks in the Titano (the name the War Wag was Christened), on a desperate rescue mission. <br />Along the way they encounter a group of Magistrates led by none other than Baron Sharpe himself, and an uneasy alliance is formed between both parties, as their final destination, AREA 51, remains the same.  Even though their collective reasons for hitting the mythical base are different. <br />The novel is action packed, as you would expect, but it also gives a long overdue insight into the Albino Domi's mind, and the how's and whys she reacts the way she does.  It also fleshes out this character even more so.<br />To add icing to the cake, several new characters are introduced in the novel, well some really re-introduced, that could prove to be great friends, or deadly foes.  These characters range from several Hybrids, to Magistrates as well as the Tigers of Heaven (introduced for the first time in Outer Darkness).<br />Even though the Tigers play only a small role in the novel, the events that take place on their island off the western coast will play significantly in upcoming novels. We're talking some very high tech, very unusual occurrences. <br />Also, there is something that happens in the novel that will shock any long time reader.  Well two things, if you count what happens to Grant. <br />Enjoy, it is well worth the read, and I personally can't wait to get my hand on Purgatory Road. Which incidentally, has Kane, Brigid and Grant prominently displayed on the cover.  <br />Chris	2001-03-20

With the destruction of the Mesa redoubt, the hybrids are scrambling to find a way to survive.  Baron Cobalt has discovered a facility that suits their needs.  AREA 51, or Dreamland.  However, he doesn't wish to share this information with his fellow barons, so he sends a hit and run team into Snakefishville territory to capture `merchandise' for his own personal use. <br />This catches the attention of Kane and the other exiles in Cerberus. They go to investigate and during their travels, they meet with the Tigers of Heaven.  Grant is almost instantly smitten by one of the female warriors, causing even more tension between him and Domi.<br />It also gives a deeper look into Grant's feelings and attitudes towards being an exile and a criminal, after spending so many years as a magistrate and in the service of the Barons. <br />This novel reveals a deeper insight into the hybrids and their now desperate struggle to survive, introduces a new `ruler' to the baron's themselves, as well as the fate of several characters that were introduces earlier in the series. <br />For those of you who have also been following Deathlands, this novel reveals what happened to Front Royal, and the role it played in the unification program.  No, it isn't revealed what happened to the Cawdors.   <br />As with all trilogies, this novel left me wanting more, but I have to wait to get the second in the series. The author simply couldn't cram all the background data into one novel and make it readable, without adding at least another hundred or so pages.<br />The novel is a little more combat intensive than some of the previous books, but that doesn't take away from the overall storyline.<br />As per usual, it's the kind of novel one would expect from Mark Ellis and expands the already rich mythology behind Outlanders.  <br />Excellent work once again!	2000-11-14
US	51028243	RR8NJE703D6ZO	0373625618	654825426	Rat King (Deathlands)	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Inside vs Outside	I have finished Rat King and here are my thoughts on it. <br />The author did  a fairly good job in getting the characterization down, the characters were   acting in the way that we've all become accustomed to over the years.  I  did enjoy seeing people who've been not mentioned in many novels brought up  again, such as Michael Brothers, Lori Quint, Uncle Tyas and so forth. It's  nice to see they are no longer  forgotten.<br />The basic story is that the  group of warrior survivalists find themselves inside a redoubt that is  filled with the inbred and mutated descendants of military personnel who  believe that the war against the Soviets is still taking place and where  rank is determined through hereditary instead of skill.  They are also at  war with a small tribe of equally inbred and mutated survivors who live  hours away, who they call the Outsiders.<br />The arrival of the group is a  godsend to the insiders as they have Doc Tanner with them.  General Wallace  needs him to be joined with a supercomputer called Mobius, or the Rat King.  <br />Ryan's group are actually encouraged to  escape, as Wallace has a plan  to capture Doc Tanner.  It goes off without a hitch, but at the same time  Ryan and his other people encounter the Outsiders and are subsequently  captured and forced to return with the survivors. <br />At the survivors camp  the group are to be sacrificed. But they quickly turn the tide.  Instead of  killing their captors, they cut a deal with them and agree to train them in  order to  use them in assaulting the Insiders redoubt and rescuing Doc  Tanner.<br />The results are as to be expected. I won't  go into any more  details. <br />I had three problems with the book. They are as  follows:<br />Inside the redoubt, Those hooked into the comp claimed that they  had no idea what had happened over the years, but were able to access Doc's   memory.  Through this they should have been  easily able to discover what  Doc told them about the holocaust to be true.<br />The second problem I had  with the book was that the author kept bringing up that Doc was always on  the brink of insanity. Which is not the case. Over the series, Doc gained  more and more control over his faculties. I hope that the authors would  realize this.<br />The third and final problem I had with the book was in a  fight between Jak and one of the Outsiders. Jak has been described as one  of the best hand to hand fighters there are and has been able to fight  multiple attackers and win. I seriously don't think that one man would take  him down.<br />Here is the reason why. The author did an exceptional job  describing how both insider and outsider groups believe that they are  exceptional combatants, due to the fact that they have never really had  anyone else to fight other than each other.<br />The arrival of Ryan's group  prove otherwise.<br />SO, if that is the case, Jak should not have been beaten  so easily. <br />Overall, I give the novel a 3 and a half out<br />of five. It  was worth while reading.	2000-09-13

Here we have another instalment of the  mythical and legendary exploits of Kane, Grant, and the rest of the exiles of Cerberus.<br /> This particular  adventure is a truly global spanning affair, with ventures to the most  remote and inhospitable local on the planet, the Ant Arctic, where the  exiles discover a two hundred and fifty year old nazi stronghold.  I won't  go into any more detail, lest I spoil it for my fellow readers.<br /> This  trip does explain a few mysteries that linger to this day on what happened  after the fall of the Third Reich, but it comes at a very high price.<br />  However, it doesn't stop there.  Once again the exiles find themselves  returning across the Atlantic to Imperial Britannica.<br /> Kane, summoned  by the hybrid Fand, is once again swept across the ocean to defend a land  that he wasn't born in, to prevent ancient technology  falling into the  wrong hands. If certain parties were to obtain these ancient devices, it  could well mean a second skydark.<br /> Upon reaching British soil Kane  and Grant discover exactly what happened to the Dragoons after the  disappearance of Lord Strongbow.  The Irish Celts have returned to Britain  with a  vengeance. The Dragoon leadership fell to the hands of a massive,  one eyed man named Quayle, who with the help of the Irish Doomie Morrigan,  uncovered the location of a mythological isle off the coast, that is  supposedly one of the Outposts of the lost continent of Atlantis.<br /> A  beaten and battered Kane, with his brother in arms Grant must once again  take on the Dragoons in a last ditched effort to eliminate the imperium  once and for all, and prevent Quayle from obtaining his goals.<br /> Over  all, a rousing adventure well worth  reading, and as usual, the author has  gone out of his way to explain mythology and mesh it wonderfully into the  Outlanders setting.	2000-08-07

But  for the record it's getting a 3.5 from me. <br />The reason I am giving it a  3.5 are as follows. Here are the things that I didn't like about it. The  biggest thing was yet ANOTHER mutant power that Krysty has developed. That  makes three new powers she's exhibited since Stoneface.  <br />Those of you  who know me and my reviews know that I can't stand weird mutants.  And this  book had another one. The whole situation around this particular mutant  was, in my opinion very similar to Deep Rising but set on land.  Still, I  must admit that if this was a genetically engineered creature, it would  make one heck of a weapon. <br />Lastly, I don't think the characters were up  to snuff but lets face it, every writer will write the characters  differently. <br />Those are the things that I didn't care about.  Now for the  things I did like!<br />The Wards and Novaville. It was said in the novel that  Novaville had at one time been a prison.  I was very impressed on how the  writer showed how the society would have evolved after nearly one hundred  years.  I won't go into full details as it would take too much time but I  was quite impressed.<br />The second thing I liked about the book was the  'Ranger' and the problems that it brought with it. Again I won't go into  many details but I liked it! Had overtones of the movie 'The Beast' from  the late 80's.<br />Yet another thing that really caught my attention was how  a lot of the descendants viewed technology as either magic or legend.  My  hats off to the writer.  <br />Overall if you like lots of non stop action,  with overtones of military adventure, this book is for you.  <br />Keep up the  work, I hope that your next novel continues to get even better!	2000-06-16

Even after talking to the author about it and being told to be disappointed, that wasn't what had happened.<br />Sure, it was more combat oriented than most of the previous  novels and there was a creature that may or may not have been a vampire,  but the rest of the novel more than made up for that.<br />The story centered  more around Brigid and Dafore.  It was great to see these two characters  getting more attention than ever and learning more about the medic from the  Cerberus redoubt. That alone makes the novel worth while picking up.<br />Then  there is the scientific explination on the swampies, as well as the vampire  family from Bloodlines, and a re-visit to South America and the natives  that were encountered in Emerald Fire.<br />I was told that Science Fiction  and Horror do not mix.  Sometimes it's true, other times, take the Alien  movie series, it works.  As long as the writer takes the time to explain  things, it will always work out.<br />And there is an added bonus that we  learn more about the Magistrate training as well as what happened to the  installation where the Aurora crashed in Armageddon Axis. <br />Worth while  reading folks!	2000-05-18

He also did a  wonderful job in bringing up new questions regarding the Barons and their  needs for ore and computer equipment.<br />The data brought up about the  western islands was very well written and I enjoyed the history that he  created for the novel.

And without caps mind you. *grins*<br />Thisparticular novel was in my opinion one of the very best.  My personal favorite was Dark Emblem and this comes a close second behind it. <br />Why?  Because the story was well written and it was defenitly a change of pace from the typical Deathlands.  It had a lot of action, to be sure but wasn't saturated with it like the Barony Trilogy was. <br />The Author actually took the time to explain the technology involved and the situations instead of just dropping the reader into them and letting them figure it out on their own. <br />I was truly impressed with how the author described the alternate universe, where human life was so cheap that millions could die and not a single person blink an eyelash at.  He did a exceptional job when it came to the description of how desperate things were, how everything was falling apart and how close humanity tittered on the brink of extinction. <br />However, I was not in the slightest bit impressed with the EMP pulse that Krysty released to take out the lazer mines that had been left behind as a trap by the invaders into the Deathlands. That single situation caused me to drop my review from a full five out of five to a four out of five. <br />Overall, this was a very enjoyable novel and I strongly recommend it to all the readers out there, especially if you enjoyed Outlanders Lost Earth Trilogy.	2000-03-22

But the worst thing is that there were two major  mistakes in the first 60 pages. I won't tell you what they are but suffice  to say I almost put the book down and couldn't continue.

The author has shown us a brief  glimpse into the worlds that Kane and Co will be visiting.   What we were  shown, the future where Nazi Germany had won WW2 was truly horrifying, and  makes me more thankful than ever that the allies had won the war.  Col.  Thrush (introduced in Omega Path) has thrown down the gauntlet and has  challenged Kane to stop him.

If they pass, they become members of the  community, if they fail, they die. Of course we nearly lost one of the  characters and when Ryan went for his nightly relief in the woods he was  attacked. There were  a few suprises though that made up for the usual.   The biggest was the meal that they ended up sharing.  That suprised me more  than you can imagine. Overall the book was average.  A real shame. I was  hoping for something really spectacular.	1998-12-01

Well, having read Iceblood, I have to say that it was one of the best Outlanders novels to date!  Let me explain my reasoning behind it.  First, take everything that you thought you knew about the Archons and toss it out  the window. A huge number of questions have been answered regarding their  origin, what happened to them, and about Balam as well.  There are going to  be two parts of the novel that should surprise you as much as they have  surprised me.   Another thing that got me. There is an incident that  occures in a museum in the ruins of New York city that just has to be read  to believe.  I burst out laughing when I read it!  Very well written. And  Grant's comments about New York should induce a great deal of humor as  well! Finally, as of this book I have a feeling that the direction of the  series is about to take a different direction. I have no idea if my  thoughts on this are correct or not, but I guess with the release of the  first book in the upcoming trilogy: Hellbound Fury, I'll find out if I am  correct or not. The series has been built up, came to what I consider a  major turning point, and can only continue to get better from here on in.  Don't get me wrong of course, I loved the first seven novels, and they just  kept getting better and better.  If the novels continue this way, the  series should go for many years to come. A personal note to the Author.   Keep this up man!  You have a fan for life!	1998-11-28

It's similar in the  formula to all the others in the series in the aspect that Ryan and the  group jump blindly to a new redoubt, explore and encounter the enemy,  finally making their way back to the redoubt and jumping once again.<br />  Well, where this novel differs is the fact that the author explains exactly  what happened to Doc Tanner and the time he spent with the Whitecoats  before being pushed into the uncertain future of the Deathlands.  The main  antagonist in the novel isn't your typical power mad baron either.<br />Over  all, I was VERY impressed with this novel and I would have to say that it  was probably the best Deathlands I have read to date.  And that says a  great deal.<br />And, who better to review the book than the owner of one of  the biggest Deathlands Websites on the net?  The Deathlands Web Survival  Guide.	1998-10-06

Way back in the beginning of the Deathlands series, the author gave us our  first glimps into Zulu Redoubt.  An inbred family tried very hard to kill  Ryan and his band.  Anyhow, there was a locked off section of the redoubt  that we were never once allowed to see what was hidden.  UNTIL NOW!<br />The  secret that laid dormant for nearly two centuries was awakened by a  magistrate and archivist. The end result was the death of a Baron which has  never happened before in the history of the villes.<br />Kane, Grant, Brigid  and Domi are sent to investigate the death, and the implications.  They  discover far more than they ever expected. Yet another mystery left over  from the Archon Directive.<br />The name isn't misleading, but Doomstar isn't  what you expect it to be.<br />And to the author.... I want to see Tara  return!<br />Chris Van Deelen Owner of the Deathlands web survival Guide.	1998-10-06
