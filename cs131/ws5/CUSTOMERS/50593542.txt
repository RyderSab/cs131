The book is about a woman who is in the hospital having surgery and dies. She tells about her expirence and what happens. The part I liked the most  is were she tells about the garden and the beutiful rose.  The book was  happy , sad, and most of all, hopeful and inspirational. I recommend this  book to a person with deep spirtual and religous beliefs. I hope you enjoy  this book as much as I did!	1999-12-13

The two things I hate most about this book was that the characters were flat, this means the characters didn't catch your attention much. Then the second thing was that they paraphrased  almost everything, and I thought that was very hard to understand or even  know what they were talking about. Like they would be talking about one  thing then jump to something else. I would probably recommend this book to  people who like Indian Cultures or like emotional books.	1999-12-13

In the book, Fly Away Home, a little boy and his father live in a airport and sleep sitting up so they won't have to to sleep on the streets. I think it's a great book because the boy and his father do not have to live on the streets. I don't like the  book because the boy and his father live in an airport. If you know anybody  that is homeless or was homeless, they would understand the book. To find  out if the little boy and his father find a home, read the book Fly Away  Home by Eve Bunting.	1999-12-10

It had so much detail. I loved the part when Darryl killed Brandon because you got so into  the book-it was like you were  there. I also thought it was neat when, at the  end, I found out why the 3 M's: Mary, Margie, and Meline all  keep stareing  at Hope. Your going to have to read the book to find out for yourself.  One  thing I didn't like is when Hope told Eden that her mom talked about how  fat she was when really she was just a little bit overweight. However I  would recommend this book to any R.L.

I would recomend this book to a middle school student or above.  My opinion about this book is that I liked it, it kept me reading because of all the action.  I also liked this book because it was easy to read. It was better  than the movie, like when the Tin Man kept cutting off all the animals'  heads.  One thing I didn't like about this book is that it was different  than the movie. When I was reading the book the movie came on T.V and I  watch the movie and it cunfused me a little.  If you haven't read the book  yet, you should because it is a very good book and if you want to read the  REAL story, read THE WIZARD of OZ.	1999-12-10

It tells you all about the troubles that people in the Dust Bowl had to face.  The year was 1936 and Billie Jo was a  terrific piano player.  She did a couple of gigs with Mad Dog until  something happened to her and her mom. The part I hated the most was when  her aunt blamed her mom's death on Billie Jo.  So if you want to know what  happens,read it and if you like books that get sad, happy, and funny at  times then check it out.  If you want to get out like Billie Jo wanted to  get OUT OF THE DUST, then just read it.	1999-12-10

It is the only one that I have fallen in love with, so far.  One of the best parts in this book is when Delrita's Aunt Queenie and her Uncle Bert  come over for dinner. Punky (Delrita's uncle with Down Syndrome)was eating  chicken in the living-room and Aunt Queeniewent in there and found him  throwing chicken bones behind the television. That drove her bananas.     A  very touching part in this story is Delrita and Punky were at Silver Dollar  City,and they met a wood-carver named Whittin Walt.  He was the best.   Later that day he helped Punky and Delrita find their parents.  They called  the hospitals,police department,and the Highway Potrol Office.  They  couldn't find them, so they spent the night at Mr.Walt's house.  That  morning he got a phone call saying that the parents of Delrita and Punky  were in a car accident.  Delrita's Uncle Bert came and picked them up.   Thier Aunt Queenie met them at the door.  Anevella was there too.  Anevella  is Delrita's best friend. At the very end, Anevella and Delrita were  carving wood when Delrita decided she was going to carve a swan and put it  on her parents grave.  This was a very touching and sad story.  I would  recamend this book to anyone and everyone.  If you want to read this book,  run to the nearest libary and check it out.	1999-12-10

The reason I say this is because the text is easy to read for a ten year old and at the age of ten, girls and there sisters start to fight or they find out what certain  diseases are and what they can do to your body. Well, that's what this book  is about, an older sister that has a very serious disease and is dying.  This book shows the relationship between the two sisters, shows what the  older sister has to go through with the disease, family, and friends, and  shows what the younger sister does to help save her older sister. I didn't  really dislike anything about this book, the author explained everything in  great detail. This is a very touching book.

My over all opinion of this book was that it was very suspenceful. It was a book that you didn't want to put down. You wanted to keep reading to find out what happened.                                      It was about these students that were getting tired of  their English teacher so they wanted to do something about it. So they took  him up to the mountains to scare him. He needed to take this certain kind  of medicine but he never got it because of what they did. What do you think  will happen to Mr. Griffin? What will their consequences be?     I really  liked this book alot. My favorite part was when these hikers that were up  in the mountains found Mr. Griffin's body. This was a good book, but the  begining was slow. However it didn't make it to where I wouldn't read it  again. I would recommend this book to someone that would like mysteries or  thrillers.	1999-12-10

Sarah, the comanders  daughter and life-long crush of Loch, has a rin in with the creatures about  two times and each time someone died. Like the camera man who got chewed in  half and the gaurd that got his legs chwed off by the monsters babies and  things go crazy. The ending is cool 'cause the comander gets attacked by  the monsters leader, and he desurved it.   My opinion on thhis book is that  it is heavy in detail and adventure.  The coolest part in the book is when  the ending war between the creatures and humans.  I would only let the  strong stomsched and gore loving and adventure loving people read this and  I give a full five stars.	1999-12-10

It kind of related to me I'm in the seventh grade and was  afraid of fitting in when I first came to junior high.It was all about  being bullied by someone or being a bully.Seventh Grade Wierdo talks about  a boy named Josh who wants to impress a girl by standing up to his  bully,but doesn't know if she'll like him for it.   I like the part when  Josh is taking a shower in the locker room and the bully,&quot;Shark,&quot;  took his clothes and Josh was running around the school naked.Then,the girl  he likes sees him naked.   But,I didn't like that in some parts it got  really boring and didn't really have any meaning in the story.   I  recommend this book to kids of all ages and most especially kids in junior  high such as seventh graders.Also,kidsthat don't fit in too well.

After a little while  Wilbur finally says something about her web. Somethings I dislike about  this book is that Wilbur had to go stay with other pigs that he didn't even  know. The part I realy didn't like was when the little girl threw a  tempertantrum and ran out the door to go find her pig. I would recommend  this book to my aunt because she lives on the farm and she likes pigs. If  you like pigs, well this is the book for you.	1999-12-10

The first time I read this book Ithought in my mind maybe Ishould read a whole book. This book has good illistration. This book is the kind of reading material that some  people who would like funny reading and sometimes it has some  emotion.<br />The begining of this book was a bad thing for the Love family.  When Mr. Love came home he said he had a surprise for the family. so they  came into the kitchen. His mom does not like surprises, so he got them all  in the kitchen and told them what he got: He said I won a camcorder. And  when they were talking about what they were going to do with it, his sister  and mother had the same opinion to get rid of it while Buddy and his dad  had different things they wanted to do with it like Buddy wanted to make  his own movie and his dad wanted to tape the Chicago Bears  practice.<br />There were many parts I liked but there was this one part that  got me; it is where Buddy locks his sister in the garage for taping him in  his underware. He left her in the garage for hours.Another part I didn't  like was when his sister got revenge on him by filming him in the  shower.<br />I would recommend this to people who like funny revenge. It is an  excellent book to revenge and tells you that you can get revenge without  making it evil.	1999-12-10

Louis L'Amour does a graet job of getting the readers attention and keeping it throughout the book. The author discribes the setting so well,  it feels like you are there. My only dislike of this book would be that the  author skips around from subject to subject, but it did make the story make  sence. I think anyone with a sense of adventure or anyone that likes  western books would like this book.	1999-12-10

The name of my favorite book is &quot;A Girl Named Disaster.&quot; I thought that this book should receive a five star rating because it was so dramatic, dangerous, and also very sad. I thought this book is an  all-around good book and I wish I had a copy of it. There were very few  things I disliked about this book. However, it was very emotional, there  were parts I didn't understand, but other than that it was a very good and  detailed book. A young girl named Nhamo's, mother was killed when Nhamo was  a baby by a leopard and her father had killed someone and left Nhamo with  her aunts, Aunt Chipo and Aunt Shuvai. A disease starts to kill people in  her village so they go to this man her cousin is supposed to gett married  to and he told them that Nhamo was the cause and that she was a witch.When  they got back to their village the wedding was a few days later and her  Grandmother helped her escape in Crocidile Guts boat. Nhamo meets a lot of  animals on her journey but the rest you have to read for yourself. I think  people with an average reading level should read this because it is hard to  understand and has hard words in it, but other than that I think anyone  that likes dangerous, and action filled books should read this great book.	1999-12-10
US	50593542	R2HJI8FM272MDG	0689800959	283772589	Alice the Brave	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Alice the Brave	One of the stories I liked was Alice the Brave I would give this book at least five stars. It's about this girl named Alice who has a very deep fear of water. She's in a club which is more  like a swimming club. Her friends  meet at a pool and swim almost every day. Alice just stays at    the 2foot  part of the pool. Toward the end of the story her brother Lester teaches  her how to swim. My overall opinion about this book is that you can relate  it to your lives or things that happen in teenage years. My favorite part  is when she over comes her fear. The only thing I didn't like was that it  could of been a little better or more specific. If you don't think this  review is very detailed then read the book! If you like fear, romance,  sillyness, and of course happy endings read this book.	1999-12-10

I think Mary Dawning Hahn is a very good writer. I've read a lot of her books, but I think this onewas the best of all of them. the story is  about a girl named Cynda that is 14. Her mom and step-father travel around  the world, so she has to go live with her dad. While she's there she meets  a guy she likes and his name is Vincent. He is way older than she is. One  thing I like about this book is when they first meet. One thing I disliked  about this book was it started kinda slow.I think people who like vampire  romance novels should read this book. If you want to know more about this  book this book read it.	1999-12-10

After every chapter she leaves you with an exciting ending. My favorite part was when Chad was sleeping and the snake came  after him. The main characters are Chad and Jeannie. She gave them great  names. I think that this book needed to have illustrations to show the  reader what was going on. This book was exciting and full of adventure. I  also think that this book needed to be longer. Anyone who enjoys mysteries  would like to read this book.	1999-12-10

I was very surprised that it had alot of deaath and other things like that in it. But, the book was nothing like the movie. The mmmovie talks about  Toto the dog getting lost, but in the book Toto stays with Dorthy the whole  time. My favorite paart inthe Wizard of Oz book, was when the characters go  talk to the Wizard one by one and the Wizaaard was always a different thing  every time. Dorthy asked the Wizard to go back to Kasas and he said to her  that she had toget ride of the Wicked Witch of the East. Then the lion goes  in and he has to hellp and then the rest of the things go in and they all  have to help them all had to help Dorthy. They had to do alot but they  finlly all go back and say that they wanted what they asked for and he  helped them all. But to find out if Dorthy goes back to Kansas, read  thhis  book. the only thing that iI  didn't like about this book was that they  shouldn't have put the lion in it. A lot of aadults and kids should read  thhis book, they would love it like I did. So that is why I think you guys  should read the wizard of Oz.                THE END	1999-12-10

Brian dicribes the home of Tammo in a way that makes me feel like I'm standing with him while he is being punished for chipping the  blade of his fathers battle ax.  The traveling was just as exciting not  knowing whin some one is about to pounce on you. The discription of each of  the Long Patrol offacers the cournal and others. what I'm saying is no one  can make mice and rats sound so interesting. But thir was some down-falls,  for examle when Rockjaw and Russha where killed by the first blade beside  the bad parts, it was a terrific book.	1999-12-10

I think the book Takedown is a great book.I gave five stars because it talks about per-pressure,and tells what you should do if kids are picking on you.I liked the part when Sean beat the Bully in a wreasling match,and  he won the trophy.I didn't like the part when the bully and his friends  beat up Sean fo wearing this pen that said &quot;I'am the best&quot;.Sean  met this guy who thought Sean some wreasling moves,that know body nows  about.Why'll they were talking Sean foung out that he was a referefor  wreasling.	1999-12-10

Paulsen's writing is exceptional and leaves the reader feeling as though they are in the novel themselves.  Though this book does have some gross parts, it is not a  central focus and is overridden by the great plot and characters.        I  would recommend this book to anyone who likes other Paulsen novels- this  one is a keeper!	1999-12-07
