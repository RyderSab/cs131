VI: Return of the Jedi)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	You know they're good, but not how good until you read them.	The first thing that will strike you when you begin reading &quot;A New Hope,&quot; will be the level of skill with which George Lucas writes.  He truly is an artist in the highest sense of the word.  &quot;The Empire Strikes Back,&quot; is nothing more than a simple literary translation of the script.  But both &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; are very well written, both having some truly stunning poetic breakthroughs in the prose.  The biggest beef is that Obi-Wan is referred to as finding and training young Anakin and that Yoda trained Obi-Wan. Of course, now in 2002, we know about Qui-Gon Jinn and all that.  I hope Omnibus has the sense to correct these obvious errors in ultimate plot.  Other than that, it is well-written and deserves to be read by yourselves and by children.	2002-05-10

I'm giving this book five stars for the pure enjoyment of reading it.  I ingested the whole 340+ pages in two sittings.  I was hooked after page 5.  I'm not giving away anything, but I feel it's only fair to let any possible reader know that in this volume of the Star Wars saga we finally uncover Anakin's connection with Uncle Owen and Aunt Baru who eventually raised Luke on Tattoine, as well as the origens of Boba Fett and possibly the origins of the hordes of Storm Troopers who were accepted as a natural presence in the first trilogy.  Some of the best writing in the book comes about from Anakin and Padme's budding romance.  In the end, the reader is left understanding how Anakin begins turning to the Dark Side and is also forced to accept that not too many of us, given his powers and the brutal realities Anakin faces, would have made different choices.  How many of us are on the dark path right now in our lives?  An excellent read.  I recommend taking it in before you see the movie; it'll only add to your enjoyment and allow you to concentrate more on the effects and action when you already know the storyline.	2002-05-02

If you go back through his previous books, audio tapes, and video programs, you can pick out the themes that are displayed so righteously in this little volume.  Kennedy did an outstanding job editing the talks, brief essays, interview, and discussions into a seamless thesis that begins and ends with the same statement evident throughout: The western problem is the misreading of religious metaphor as historical fact rather than connotative of a mystery that transcends human thought completely.  Bravo to the Joseph Campbell Foundation for crystallizing a lifetime of brilliant thought and scholarly analysis into a truly life-affirming philosophy by a wonderful and engaging teacher.	2002-04-26

The advice is so commonsense that it is often overlooked.  The writing itself is written in plain language that often jumps off the page.  The detailed examples of fallacies and correct grammar usage are essential in any writer's understanding of proper structure on the way to developing their own style.  This book, along with Stephen King's &quot;On Writing,&quot; will be the two books that I, as a writer, will always defer to when speaking to another writer about how to write.  This classic will live as long as our language does.	2002-04-25

So much of a reader's interpretation of poetry, after the first time reading it, is based on feeling. When I finished the last poem, I felt like I had a very sick and dying relative--one I loved greatly--and after a long period of suffering, she finally dropped away peacefully.  There is so much hope and sadness in these pages that it will take at least two read throughs until I can begin dissecting the cerebral aspect of the poems (and there is much: angels, ashes, whiskey, and the color grey).  There were sittings when I could read three or four poems and there were times when I could only get through one.  And every time I left the folded book feeling satisfied.  These are poems to read before bedtime, substituted for that shot of whiskey mixed with ashes.  Congrats, George.  Someday the philistines will know your name as well.	2002-04-15

I say that with exception of the music from the movie (John Cafferty and the Beaver Band did an exceptional job).  First let me say that on the basis of plot, the book is superior to the movie.  There was an attempt to tie in some of the back plot in the second movie... Where the novel really shines is in the deep characterization of the secondary characters... Wendell's characer was so much more instrumental in the novel, as the only musician who was in on Eddie's secret experiment at Lakehurst.  Since the novel is told in the first person, Frank Ridgeway comes alive... If you can get ahold of this book, it will be worth whatever you have to go through to get it...	2002-02-28

I bought this book as a resource and an overview of XP Home Edition.  I got much more than I bargained for.  I read the entire book, cover to cover (skimming parts that didn't apply to me, of course); and over-all I found the book to be written in understandable language and in a tone that will appeal to many lay readers of computer literature.  The authors have done an excellent job of relaying technical information in a way that is not stuffy and actually holds the reader's attention (most of the time).  This is worth the money.	2002-02-06

To any free thinking individual, the things that Bernie Goldberg has to say are nothing new.  There is a liberal bias in network news.  But Goldberg holds that this bias is not intentional, but is seen as \\"middle of the road,\\" reasonable, rational viewpoints and anything else is crazy.  This is why conservatives are always \\"right wing\\" and liberals are labeled as \\"experts\\" on the network news and telezine programs, like 60 Minutes.  Golberg has the inside knowledge that really drives the point home, and who would've thought that Dan Rather was such a ... to work for.  He's got a lot to answer for and Goldberg is calling him to task.  This book is a must read for anyone interested in being aware of the slight of presentation in our so-called information givers.  At least Fox News reporters have the honesty to call themselves analysts instead of reporters.  Read this book.	2002-01-22

This book is common sense from the first word, which means that liberals will hate it and conservatives will agree with everything except the libertarian tenets that Elder holds, such as holding government down to an absolute minimum.

Will tide you over until 4th Season	I have been wanting this book since it came out a year or so ago.  It did NOT disappoint.  There is so much in this book that doesn't come from the show.  I remember writing a thesis on this show in college, stating that the website actually becomes a supplement to the show and by doing this, it actually pulls the viewer into the show, breaking the fourth wall.  This book does that times two.  Are the Sopranos based on actual people?  Is it truth or fiction?  By the time you get done reading this, you won't care.  This is a must read.	2001-12-27

This one is the middle finger and guess who you'll be able to show it to when you get done reading this book.  This book is mental and verbal ammunition.  When you get through reading the section about the Swiss militia, you'll stand in awe of the ignorance of the anti-gun left in this country.

In a recent gallup poll concerning religion, a significant number of people named &quot;Jedi&quot; as their religion.  I grew up with Star Wars, fully understanding the adventures of Luke Skywalker before I knew the adventures of Jesus of Nazareth.  And when I read that poll, something clicked.  Who would have ever thought that Star Wars the trilogy was really just the conclusion to a much greater story about the story of none other than Darth Vader?  This book follows the movie exactly, adding bonus insight into the Jedi religion and some back story that isn't given in the movie.  Terry Brooks is not only a capable author, he's a great writer, not given to cliche or boring prose.  All in all, I'd have to say that this book is a must read.  I'm actually going on to read the original trilogy now.	2001-12-07

I thought it would just be a rehash of the first book (excellent as it was).  But I was wrong.  O'Reilly has a great literary sense of format and the confrontational tone of this book will have the reader looking through the ropes of the ring as O'Reilly takes on the big dogs in American political life.  The best chapter is, without a doubt, the last one where O'Reilly talks about setting up your own No Spin Zone.  This is practical advice and great Sophistry from the best cable news analyst in American media history.  This one is a must read and O'Reilly remains the undisputed king of common sense.	2001-10-30

He was a kind, compassionate man with a surplus of patriotism and understanding that Big Government means little citizens and that was not the intention of the Founding Fathers.  If you want to know about brain surgery, read a book by a brain surgeon.  If you want to know about auto repair, read a book by a mechanic.  Similarly, if you want to know what it is like inside the circle of the President of the US, you must read a book by his confidant of over 30 years.

The story itself is fairly simple and if you're familiar (as you should be)with Jack Sawyer's adventures into the Territorries from &quot;The Talisman,&quot; then you might be delighted to find out the deep connnections with the Dark Tower series (all of King's books have to do with the Dark Tower in some way).

Anyone who has read the majority of King's work, knows he is far more than &quot;the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries&quot; (as he's called himself).  This book is the money for anyone who hasn't taken a writing course, but is interested in the art of writing fiction that people will want to read.  The first half of the book is dedicated to the craft, while the last section is a reminscing of King's horrible accident.  I cried the first time I read about the accident.  The pain that man went through bleeds through the page.  This one is definitely a must read.	2001-09-07

This book also sets up the following books to come (King has recently posted the prologue to DT 5 on his website).

They go through adventure after adventure and end up on an insane train named Blaine who engages them in a riddling game to save their lives.  This story ends with a huge cliffhanger that if I had read this novel when it was printed, would really have angered me.  But thankfully, I had a copy of DT 4 to come right afterwards.

He can pull these people in their physical bodies, back into his world where they join him.  This novel is out there, but so is the dark tower itself.

Actually, I got ahold of these videos through my local library at a time when I was searching for questions instead of answers.  This book is a tour de force of the mythological evolution of the human species.  Campbell addresses what the elemantary ideas of myth are and how they present themselves uniformly throughout all cultures, historical and present, of the world equally.  The thesis--there is only one mythology that is inflected in various folk manifestations, comes across beautifully.  Campbell will challenge you to rethink about religion and mythology and what it means to you as a human being.  This one is a must read.	2001-09-07

I had the priveledge to study poetry under George's tutelage and profited  greatly as a writer from the experience.  George personifies whatever  landscape he occupies at the time.  He takes the somber and dreary  environment of northwest Ohio and mythologizes it into a fading red horizon  of ash and despair with a brief underbelly of hope.  These are not poems to  raise your mood, but they will force one to consider winds, birds, and the  simple touch of another human being as something altogether different than  brutal reality reveals.  Thank you George for this gift to contemporary  poetry.  I am looking forward to your next book.	2000-07-14
