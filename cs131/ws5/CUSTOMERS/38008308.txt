Maybe that person had a faulty copy or something, but this version has not been edited.<br /><br />About the book itself: Although I had to read it for school, I found that I actually ended up liking it. The stories themselves are often somewhat bland, serving as conduits for a larger idea or theme, but I thought that the ideas the book presented were thoughtful and intriguing and some of the stories were interesting as well. As far as storyline, there are very few strong characters and the plots can be confused, isolated, and conflicting, but as it is a series of short stories and not a novel, this can be forgiven to some extent. All in all The Martian Chronicles held my interest and introduced me to some interesting ideas.	2005-08-20
US	38008308	R25RNCO8IF30KF	0689839561	446293261	The Misfits	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Perfect Fit	Although this book is a little young for me, I read it on my younger brother's recommendation and was surprised at how good it was. James Howe has written here a humorous, well-voiced, and interesting story.<br /><br />The only problems I found were that the characters, while supposedly twelve, seemed older (maybe 14), and the respective conflicts of the protagonists seemed to tie up a little too neatly at the end. However, I'm willing to forgive a little contrivance for a happy ending, especially when the story entertained me as much as this one did.<br /><br />The Misfits is relatively short (big print: I read it in under three hours just before dinner the other day) but the plot is well-developed. Also, the main character Bobby Goodspeed's voice (as I said) was done well. The book tackles one of the biggest problems faced by (pre)teens, that is, being called names. However, it also deals with the hormones and agonies of that age.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this, mostly to the younger crowd (say, 10-14, which is what the back cover says anyway) but really to anyone looking for a light, funny story about a couple of...well...misfits.	2005-07-24
US	38008308	R395G629FOBEES	0670059374	517596377	Singer	Books	2	16	17	N	N	Like Hitting A Wall	Singer is the story of a young girl who has been held captive by her powerful witch mother for 12 years. She finally escapes, and is then passed to an abbey and finally the home of several smart, talented women who are a center of trust in her shaky world. The first half or so of the book rushes by quickly, developing neither characters, settings nor even the plot. However, the book then begins to pick up, gaining maturity and depth, with the introduction of several interesting characters (like King Harry, the Fair Folk outcast guised as a cat). The meat of the book, however, is supposed to be her involvement with the children of Lir, centered around the folk story. Jean Thesman, however, tries to rush most of the plot into the last sixty or so pages of the book, leaving gaping plot holes, one dimensional characters, and confusion.<br /><br />But the worst part is the ending. Singer's final confrontation with her all-powerful mother, besides being badly explained and hurriedly done, is so pathetic as to be almost laughable. Singer's supposed powers, her supposed sacrifice, do not even come into play, and her mother dies instead when her husband chases her and she falls out of a castle. A page later, the book is over, leaving the reader (me, at least) so unsatisfied I wondered if a chunk of the pages had been ripped out, or if I could get my money back from the library.<br /><br />To me, there is nothing worse than when a writer writes an interesting and involving book and then is too cowardly or lazy to work out an ending, instead setting down something stupid and quick just to finish the book.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book to anyone unless they don't plan to finish it. In that case, stop around page 130. It all goes down hill from there.	2005-06-08

US	38008308	R2HLMGHCB2WUZ2	0385730578	654449227	Deep	Books	2	2	5	N	N	Not very good	Deep is about two people, Morgan and Birdie. Morgan is alright as far as characters go, but she isn't developed enough--the book centers on Birdie--and she seems out of place, as if she belongs in a whole other book. Birdie, however, is an annoying brat. She is arrogant, self-centered, useless, and needy...and besides that, she hasn't changed by the end of the book.<br />The plot is pretty bad too. Basically, Morgan is a lone Carribean sailor from Norway. Her siblings are dead, she left her drunken parents in Panama. Now she's wandering. Birdie and her family are leaving Oregon and moving to a Carribean Island. Unfortunately, on their first day down, before they even get to the island, Birdie is kidnapped by a mentally unstable kidanpper named Nicholas. Somehow he manages to get away and Birdie is then taken to a remote island. She does nothing to try and help herself, enjoying her circumstances half the time, and stays there for a couple of months. I won't give the ending away, but its equally unconvincing. I really don't recommend this book.	2005-04-07

It toys with not only the idea that people WANT to change the world, but that they CAN, without superpowers or magic or an appearance on Oprah. This was a Kid Runs For President book without the immaturity; it focused less on the age of the candidate than on the issues-real, true, important issues-he's pushing. Is this book realistic? No, of course not--but instead of faulting the author, why not fault ourselves? Why couldn't a group of people who were willing to fight for something get the rest of us to care? Not only does Janet Tashjian provide real solutions to problems--exaggerated and stretched, but on the right track--but she also introduces the novel idea of the Critical Patriot: the person who sees the flaws of the country but doesn't retreat into cynical commentary. The person who actually loves this country with its flaws AND IS WILLING TO MAKE IT BETTER. Her realistic portrayal--using actual candidates, events, issues, and facts--makes it all the more relevant to us. I think that all teens should read this book, just as all teens should register to vote when they're old enough. Josh/Larry is the symbolic epitome of what teens COULD be--not necessarily candidates but activists, working to make America and the world a better place. This book takes a stand--so should we.	2004-10-28

Becca's grandmother has just died, leaving her family with questions: What was her real name, where was she from, and was she really the princess she claimed to be, the princess Briar Rose from Sleeping Beauty, the story that she left behind as her legacy? With only a few random papers and pictures to guide her, Becca follows a trail that leads her to Poland, where her grandmother was supposedly from. And it is in Poland, near the site of an extermination camp from WWII, that she finally learns the truth about the past.<br /><br />I loved this story; it was interesting, engaging, sad, funny, beautifully written, flawlessly plotted. And like all fairy tales, it has a happy ending, although I suppose that depends on whether you're Rumpelstiltskin or the Queen.	2004-10-13

Wicked is the story of the Wizard of Oz told not about Dorothy but instead about, as the title divulges, the life and times of the Wicked Witch of the West. It spins the tale out from the beginning, before any tornado or dog or scarecrow, when a baby girl is born with sharp teeth and green skin. Elphaba, she is named; those who birthed her would have drowned her if she hadn't scared them with her sharp bite, and her first word is \\"horrors.\\" But all the same, she is human, and while she lacks the basic tact and pretense of humans, she is by no means wicked.<br />The story is divided into 5 parts; as with any long book, some parts are better than others and some are on occasion tedious. In the second and third parts, the best by far, the story skips on from her young years to her college years. Here it covers her friendship with Glinda, her work for Animal rights, her encounter with the Wizard of Oz--not at all wonderful--her affair with a prince from the western lands. It delves into the personalities of Glinda and Elphaba; it shows us the strange and politically unhappy world they all live in.<br />The story contains three murders which serve as turning points; first, the death of Doctor Dillamond, which ends up leading Elphaba into a life of hiding and resistance work in the heart of the Emerald City; the death of Fiyero, her lover, which crumbles her world and eventually sends her to the West of her title to beg forgiveness; and the later murder that Elphaba commits herself, that coincides somewhat with the final arrival of Dorothy and her troop, small characters in this large book.<br />From Gregory Maguire you can expect this: nothing is as it seems in \\"the other version\\", nothing can be expected, and although his tales sometimes grow muddled in the middle, he will always weave a tale that will make you laugh, make you cry, make you think, make you wonder.<br />And after reading Wicked, you will never look at the sparkly old-fashioned version of The Wizard of Oz in the same way again.y again.	2004-09-14

Mirror Mirror is a retelling of the classic Snow White that is at the same time more magical and more scientific. Set in Italy in the first years of the sixteenth century, Maguire incorporates real historical figures and events into his twisting creation, most notably the famous Borgias.<br />He also fills the story with contrasting elements: purity and corruption, religion and superstition, dwarves of stone and humans of fire and ice. The many threads of the novel twine together to create an intricate and multi-colored rope, sturdy and intriguing as the dwarves and vixens peppered throughout the tale.<br />The writing is eloquent, though overly descriptive and often arrogant. The characters and setting are interesting and full; although the book is certainly not without faults, it is a deep, thought-provoking read that is ideal for adults who haven't outgrown a thirst for the fantastical but now hunger for something a little darker and more thrilling.	2004-06-03

From the first sentence, Cynthia Voigt plants curiosity into your mind, and soon the story wraps around you. Elske is only 12 years old, but she is the Death Maiden and must follow her King into death. Her grandmother saves her, however, by secretly taking her place. Thus, Elske travels North, to a city whose ways, whose people, are unfamiliar. But Elske, with her honesty and open smile, makes her way in this world. When she is fifteen she becomes maidservant to Beriel, the rightful Queen of a distant and isolated Kingdom. Beriel is willful, proud, and angry; but she is a Queen through and through and Elske chooses to serve her and help her reclaim her throne.<br />Moving through various landscapes, with richly drawn characters, the thought provoking Elske is a worthwhile read.	2004-03-07

He and his family are leaving Ukraine for America. On the way, they stop at Cousin Marek's farm and while Ivan is running in the ancient woods nearby, he finds a clearing. In the middle of a clearing is a woman.<br />  This is the beginning of Orson Scott Card's Enchantment. When Ivan first sees this woman, he runs away. When next he returns from America to the same place -- a college student, a track star, and engaged to be married -- he faces his fear and does not run. Instead he wakes up Katerina, Princess of a place called Taina that existed over 10 centuries ago. Unwittingly, Ivan has stepped into the Russian Sleeping Beauty and has found that it isn't a fairy tale after all.<br />  Enchantment tells of how Ivan, unsuited to the time and culture of Taina, knowing only the language from his studies in college, and Katerina, Princess of Taina, overcome Baba Yaga, the witch who wants to end the Taina way of life and rule the country.<br />  On Ivan and Katerina's side is knowledge and eventually love. The two travel to Ivan's time to prepare for the upcoming battle with Baba Yaga. They have advanced weapons, loyal people, and Ivan's mother, who is a witch herself.<br />  But Baba Yaga has fear on her side; the power of a spellbound god; sorcery, hatred, trickery. She will give them no easy victory.<br />  Enchantment is a captivating story; a fairy tale so original it can hardly be recognized as a retelling. The writing is powerful; the characters are real; the issues are close to home no matter where home may be. This is a wonderful read.	2004-01-31

Other versions of the Goose Girl fairytale have disappointed me, but Shannon Hale's book succeeded. Princess Anidori, Ani, is the Crown princess to the throne of Kildenree until her mother (the queen) announces that her younger brother will claim the throne and she will be married to the prince of Bayern, a country bordering Kildenree. Ani, weak and indecisive, is on her way to the country when half her honor guard massacres all those loyal to her and try to kill her in an attempt to make Selia, her lady-in-waiting, the queen.<br />Ani runs, and through the kindness of a few good people, survives and ends up as a goose girl in Bayern.

The narrator, matthew, is a likable and realistic sixth-grader, and he is not used as a shortcut--the author doesn't make him realize some great truth in an effort to end the book. Bennett's father is also a great character because we see his love for his son but also his homophobia.<br />I thought the editorial review above (the first one) was stupid. It rushes through the entire plot line, including the end (Gee, thanks--now I don't even have to read it!) and makes the whole book sound like a stupid joke. Please ignore it.	2003-11-07

For some reason, I took it out anyway and read it. The first few pages seemed to confirm my theory, but I read on.<br />And changed my mind. Getting the Girl is not the shallow sex story I assumed. It is a moving account of a boy and his life, his relationships--with \\"the girl\\", but more importantly, with his family and with himself--and his longing for \\"okayness.\\" Cameron is a believable character that you will grow to support, ache for, and feel attached to. The supporting characters have depth and truth, the plot is interesting, the setting is not stated but you get a feel for the where and the when.<br />Cameron grows as a person before your eyes as the author shaves off layer after layer to reveal him on the inside.	2003-09-08

I really just liked him for who he was. I also liked Lisa. It's not often that I really like a character, outside of the plot. Besides that, the story pulled you in and you really cared what was going to happen.

The story is about True Son, a white boy captured by the Lenni lenape indians and then reclaimed by his white family 11 years later.<br />There are numerous reasons why this book isn't a good choice to force middle school students to read. (I say force because I don't know anyone, even avid readers such as myself, who would choose to read this.) The book is violent (and yet without action), it is boring, most of the characters are unlikable (and you can't like them for their unlikableness like you can with some \\"villians\\"), and let me say that if I were Native American, I would be offended reading this book. For two reasons; first, the Native Americans in this book call themselves Indians -- where as it wasn't the NA's who coined that term but Columbus, -- and second, although this is a historical fact that shouldn't be ignored, I don't think we need to read fiction about people who think the NA's were savages and killed them like flies.<br />If school is intended to encourage us to read and learn, I have no idea why they would choose a book like this. It makes books seem boring and unrelated to teenagers. I think they should choose books that are interesting -- give us a break from textbook historical fiction.	2003-08-26

Places I Never Meant To Be is a collection of short stories written by censored writers accompanied by each writer's personal experience with censorship. While the stories are mostly good, some of them are a little 2 dimensional simply because they didn't have enough time to develop their characters and/or situations.<br />I personally enjoyed the commentary more than the stories simply because it introduced me to an issue that I knew very little about. I was a little ashamed when my own hometown was mentioned as being a place where ludicrous censorship has taken place.<br />If you're not much for short stories, you might do well to simply read the introduction and each author's point of view.

Also it has a cool cover.<br />However even if you live in...I don't know, Utah...(no offense) you'll like reading this. Vivian Vande Velde has a knack for coming up with good characters and, of course, she has an awesome sense of humor. Even her chapter titles are funny...no small feat, I assure you.<br />In Heir Apparent, Gianninne (I'm sure I spelled that wrong) is playing a total immersion virtual reality game when a group of angry people protesting fantasy break in to the building and damage the equipment. It so happens that if Gianninne doens't win the game, soon, she'll die. However, make no mistake: this isn't a drama...its a comedy. (or, though I hate to say it, a dramedy.)<br />Inside the game, she is Janine, the lost heir of King Cynric. To win, she has to ally herself with one of her halfbrothers, make peace with barbarians, fight a dragon, get a magical ring, make decisions regarding laws, answer three riddles, regain her treasury, and deal with a large group of bored ghosts who have decided to hang around.

New friends and rivals add spunk and new situations -- quite different from those in Tamora Pierce's other Tortall quartets -- keep the story of Kel fresh and exciting.<br />Also recommended: The Song of the Lioness quartet, beginning Tamora Pierce's Tortall books.	2003-07-10

Imagine my surprise when I found out that it was about Emmaline, an English girl living in the 1800's. When Emmaline's father dies, her mother, her deaf younger brother Tommy, and Emmaline must move away from their country home into a dirty, crowded city. Emmaline's mother goes to work in the mills, and Emmaline herself must work as a seamstress to her Aunt Phoebe.<br /> Then another tragedy strikes: Emmaline's mother is severely injured at the mills. She can no longer work and worse, she soon becomes hooked on laudanum, the pain-reliever she takes. Not only does she spend all the money Emmaline brings in on the drug, but she also sells Emmaline's few possessions and, eventually, even Tommy.<br /> When Emmaline finds that her mother has sold Tommy to be a chimneysweep in London, she goes there to find him. The only problems are that London is a big city, and Emmaline has no idea where Tommy is. Besides that, she doesn't have enough money to survive until she finds him.<br /> This is an awesome book that you will probably enjoy. It's historical fiction, but doesn't make you feel as if you've been lectured. I reccomend this book.	2003-06-30

It's about real issues, serious and funny, told in a sardonic, sarcastic, realistic way. John's habit of answering people in his head is one of those strange things I thought only I did, and when you read this book you'll find out that you have more in common with this strange fourteen year old boy than you might expect.	2003-03-05

It's a story about a family with four daughters living in a coal mining town somewhere in Canada(??). The family has many prblems, none of them humorous. It is a pretty morbid story, and it flits from one person's point of view to another, making it hard to ever really get to know any one character. I also think parts were rather unbelievable and unlikely. It didn't captivate the attention of the reader enough to make up for the length. If you want to, go ahead and read this but I do not reccommend it. Try something else.	2002-07-11

Once again she does a brilliant job of endearing Katie to us and writing with the wisdom of an adult and the voice of a thirteen and a half year old. Great job to Mrs. Berg.	2002-07-11

Claidi, the main character, is fun and exciting if occasionally somewhat clueless. Filled with adventure and sarcasm, friends and enemies, and lots more. Great read. Be sure also to read books 2 and 3, Wolf Star and Wolf Queen.	2002-07-10

Claidi is back with all her spunk and determination, this time on a quest to find Argul. Only its not going to be as easy as it sounds. Not that it sounds easy. The conclusion to a great trilogy.	2002-07-10

This great follow-up of Tanith Lee's Wolf Tower is incredible. Our familiar heroine Claidi is faced with a whole new set of problems, served as usual on something a little less than a silver platter. Kidnapped, brought to a new and practically uninhabited place, and forced to reckon with an uninterested prince, this is a book you shouldn't start right before doing anything else, because you won't want to put it down. Be sure to also read book 3 Wolf Queen.	2002-07-10
US	38008308	RD9SWT59GAJ3Z	037582233X	411811908	Stargirl	Books	2	1	3	N	N	Not for me	I have read a bunch of Jerry Spinelli's books and liked them, but this was not up to par. I am an avid reader and read everything from historical fiction to modern fiction to future fiction to fantasy to mysteries to everything. There are only three books I can remember ever starting and not liking enough to finish. And you guessed it, Stargirl was one of them. I'm sure that some people would probably like this book, but I thought it was awful. I thought the characters and the plot were lousy and in fact the only thing I liked about it was the cover because they just put the pictures and not the title. You might want to read it if you're library/bookstore just burned down and it's the only thing left, but otherwise, get something else.	2002-07-01

So I read this book, the second, and the third all in a row. I laughed where I was supposed to, and thought they were wonderful, because after all, everyone else had said so! But after reading them, something struck me.<br />These were awful.<br />Georgia is SELFISH as anything, ANNOYING as anything else, and STUPIDER than she is either of the former. Her life is perfectly fine but she spends all of her time ranting and feeling sorry for herself. Her insecurity is rampant--at 9:00 in the morning when no one has called her she moans about how she has no friends. She has no depth whatsoever, is not clever, and doesn't have any interesting experiences. Although I was caught up in the tide of reader goodwill, in retrospect I can't think of a single likable aspect to this book! It's like Bridget Jones's Diary with all the humor, empathy, and interest taken away.<br /><br />You might note that although I've just torn the book to shreds, I rated it a five. That was a mistake. And when you edit a review, you can't change the number of stars. Oops.<br /><br />But let it be known that what I really meant to give it was a resounding, much deserved, just-like-what-Georgia-is, ZERO.<br />Or if that failed a one.	2002-06-30
