It is full of action; from a crazy ship captain to a land assualt on a fortified fort.  Throughout the story, Hornblower again, and again, rises up to meet the challenges that confront him.  Without spoiling the book for readers that haven't read it yet, this was one super good book.  To give you an idea of how enjoyable this book was; After reading only part of this book, I went ahead and ordered the rest of the books in the series; that is how much I enjoyed this book!  I enjoyed the 1st book in the series, Mr. Midshipman Hornblower. I became addicted to this book!  You will not be disappointed in reading this one! I can't wait to read the next one; Hornblower and the Hotspur.	2004-05-02

Is a super good true story about the &quot;hair-brained&quot; mission to sent a special task force consisting of 50 vehicles and 280-300 men, with no air support and no additional ground support, 60 miles behind enemy lines to liberate 300 American officers at a German POW camp, inwhich one of the officers is General Patton's son-in-law.  Without giving away the story, this book is full of action that will keep you at the edge of yor seat.  Once started, it will be hard to put down.  This book is right in line with George Wilson's book &quot;If You Survive&quot;.  Both books are really good and have alot of action at a small price.	2004-03-17

The main character of this story is Peter Wake, U.S.N. who gets himself caught up in a pretty good fix; he's in a war on the Union side and is in love with a &quot;Reb&quot;; if the war wasn't trouble enough!  Without giving away the story, this book is very well written and is easy to read.  You do not need a nautical dictionary to help you read it; as was the case in Patrick O'Brian's Master &amp; Commander series.  I found this nautical adventure story very interesting on two accounts.  First, it is dealing with the U.S. and takes place in nearby US waters, Florida Keys area. Secondly, it is easy to read; nautical terms are very few when compared to other nautical fiction/historical books.  I enjoyed this book alot.  I can't wait to read the second book in the series.	2004-03-17

One Great Book	Eye of The Needle is a super-great WWII spy thriller that takes place in England right before D-Day.  The Germans have had spies planted in England since before the War started.  The British have slowly but surely been catching them.  Now they have come across Germany's #1 spy and he is bound and determined to make it back to Germany at all cost with Allied top secret information that will change the course of the war!  This book will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the whole story.  This was my first book that I've read from Ken Follett.  I have already ordered all of his other WWII books; I can't wait!!!	2004-02-04

I decided to read \\"The Last Battle\\" first, since my strong interest in WWII is dealing with the Americans, British, & Germans; the Russians have held little interest to me. With that in mind, I figured this book would be the least interesting to me of the three books.<BR>     Boy, was I in for a surprise!  \\"The Last Battle\\" was a very interesting and very well written book about the battle for Berlin.  The book takes turns telling the story from all sides; the Americans, the British, the Germans, & the Russians.  The book is so very well written that it just keeps flowing, very smoothly.  The book is hard to put down.  Inaddition to telling the story of the military side, you also get the horrible stories of what it was like to live in Berlin as a civilian, during its final battle.  <BR>     If you read some other reviews for this book, they all say the same thing: this is a great book, very well written.  You wiil not be disappointed!!	2003-12-13

I started to read this book and struggled to get through the 1st 3-4 chapters.  The 1st reason for my problem was that the nautical terms and discriptions of the ship were very difficult.  There is no list of terms in this book which would be very helpful.  My second problem with the beginning of this book was there is no action until you get to around chapter 5.  I almost gave up finishing the book during the 1st 3-4 chapters about 4 to 5 times.  After getting through this tough time, the story starts to improve and is pretty good.  I found this book tough to read.  I would not recommend this book to younger kids.  For younger readers (and older ones too), I would sugest Mr Midshipman Hornblower or An Eye of the Fleet.  I do not plan to continue this series any time soon.	2003-12-07

The Blooding of The Guns is a historical/fiction story about the biggest sea battle of World War I, The Battle of Jutland.  The main character is Nick Everard who is a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Navy (not a submarine LT; about the same rank as an American LTjg (junior grade) aboard the DD Lanyard. Nick has several family members who are also in the service.  Nick's brother David, is the Navigating Officer on the CA Bantry.  Nick's uncle, Hugh, is the Captain of the BB Nile.  Also, Nick's Dad is a Brigadier General in the army.<BR>  <BR>     75% of the story was boring to me.  It starts out slow, and slowly starts to build up to the Battle.  The last 3-4 chapters is full of excitement.  While in the middle of this book, I was under the personal belief that I would not purchase the next book in this nine book series.  However, with the last 3-4 chapters, it made me think twice about my overall view.  This book is full of great details of describing the different stations aboard the ships that the main characters are on.  The descriptions of the battle and of battle damage is really good.  The main draw back to the story is the number of people in this story.  There are three main ships in this story; Nile, Lanyard, and Bantry.  Trying to keep up with the story and trying to remember who is on what ship was so difficult that I had to start a list of personal for the three ships to help me keep track.  The author does not tip you off when the action goes from one ship to the next.  So that is where my personal list came in handy.  Just one example of the number of names aboard just one ship is as follows.  Aboard the DD Lanyard, the ship that Nick is on, there are several LT's mentioned including 2 sub-LT's, with one being the Navigator.  There is a Captain, Surgeon, several Petty Officers, a few Chiefs including a Chief Engineer, a Leading Seaman, a gunner, a Leading Signalman, and a steward.  Not to mention a few that I left out.  The BB Nile and CA Bantry has even more personal. That's a lot of names to keep track of! <br />     So now to conclude:  Yes, this book had a very strong ending.  However, I'm not planning on following up with this series.  In my view, having 50 different people to remember is too much!!!	2003-10-30

The main character of the series is a man by the name of Nathaniel Drinkwater.  In this book, Drinkwater is a Midshipman aboard a 36 gun frigate named the Cyclops.  The timeline is from Oct. 1779- Aug. 1781.  The British are at war with the colonies (U.S.) along with the French.  I found this book to be very exciting, which made it hard to put down.  Drinkwater is in the action up to his neck!  On top of trying to stay alive during several ship battles which include the French and an American privateer, and even fighting the &quot;rebels&quot; on land in South Carolina, he has a fellow crew member that is out to get him.  This inter-ship conflict, which carries throughout the book, keep me at the edge of my seat.  I found this book more enjoyable then Forester's The Midshipman (Hornblower, 1st in that series), which I enjoyed also. I can not wait to start the next Drinkwater book, A King's Cutter.... I would buy this book again!	2003-10-06

If you do not like non-stop action, look elsewhere!!!  This book was so much fun to read.  Zorro, The Curse of Capistrano, is about a masked man that rides around old Southern California helping &quot;settle the score&quot; against the corrupt government and its army who abuse and persecute the native peasants, and innocent and hard working people of good blood.  Zorro is a one man army that creates a huge thorn in the side for Sergeant Gonzales, his captain, and for the Governor.  Zorro is a master with the sword; and a expert horse rider.   He has nerves of steel, and his courage is never ending.  The author did a great job at keeping you at the edge of your seat.  The book became harder to put down as chapters go by.  I orginally use to watch Zorro on TV when I was a kid and had always enjoyed it.  So, after reading other reviews about this book, I knew that I had to get this!! Boy, was I in for a treat.  It is a super good book, a super good  story line that will keep you glued to the book to the very end.  I would without a doubt, buy this book again!!!!	2003-09-26

The book includes all navies that were in WWI (too many to list).  All pictures are black &amp; white.  The only color picture is the dust jacket.  For each Navy, the book lists or shows the ranks that are availible, the flags used, location of naval bases, etc.  Usually, there is only one picture (if one is available)of each ship.  If you are a WWII buff, you will need this book to go along with the Jane's Fighting Ships of World War Two.	2003-08-23

It covers many countries including Britian, France, United States, Japan, Germany, Italy, &amp; Russia.  It also includes smaller countries like Brail, China, Sweeden, etc.  There are several more.  In my option it is a good reference.  A word of warning; If you want all Ships that were in WWII you will have to purchase Jane's Fighting Ships of World War I also.  One example of this is if you look for information on the USS Arizona; you'll need the WWI book since the battleship was built in June of 1915 (during WWI).  There are no color pictures except for the dust jacket. Another aspect of the book that I enjoyed is the Recognition Silhouettes which show a side view of the ship which will be grouped by class and number of funnels.  I would recommend this book and the Jane's Fighting Ships of World War I; since they go hand and hand.	2003-08-23

To my disappointment, it details only a very few.  This book covers only a select few of the medal of honor winners who's life story could be told.  Of the men mentioned in the book, it is interesting.  It talks about their childhood, what they did in the service, and what they did once out of the service.  If you are looking for a little different angle on a few medal of honor winners, then this is your book.  If you desire information on all of the medal of honor winners then look elsewhere.	2003-08-21

To my suprise, it only covered the men who earned this medal if there was enough information about there whole life.  Of the few who's stories are in the book, it was interesting and surprising to read how there childhood, military, and post military (if they survived) life was. Also in the book, the author did mention some of the names of other award winners if they were present during the same battle.  Over all I was disappointed with buying this book.  If you are looking for a book on medal of honor winners that have there whole life story, and only a few at that, this book may interest you.  My suggestion is to either read it at a library, or wait til the price is $$$$!! I would not buy this book again; I will not read this book again!!  If you are looking for WWII medal of honor winners a really super good book is \\" Heroes of WWII\\" by Edward F. Murphy	2003-08-09

It was the 1st book of its kind that I have about this time period.  This book, for the most part, reads pretty well.  I had also bought The Hornblower Companion to help me follow the series better.  It was a big help using this companion because of the diagrams and maps it has which helps a reader follow the action better. The tough part about reading this book was the nautical terms being used. I did several searches for nautical terms on the internet, in which I had printed.  This did not help 100% however, since some of the terms I still could not find.  I plan on buying the next book in the series, Lieutenant Hornblower; hopefully it will go a little easier for me!	2003-07-27

I found the book very interesting.  Their were some very funny stories that made me chuckle; there were plenty of stories that made me realize how bad it really was over there in Europe.  Ernie followed a lot of different &quot;groups&quot; in the Army, Army Airforce, and Navy.  His writings flow very well.  Once in a while there is a short column that made me wonder why did they include this in the book; it was if the publisher just &quot;through&quot; it in there just because; this is the reason for the 4 stars.  It doesn't take long to realize why Ernie was so popular with &quot;The Guys&quot; and while they considered him, one of THEM!!!	2003-07-24

There are very few maps covering small towns or battles; the majority of the maps (99%) show the whole broad operational movements. One main reason I was interested in buying this atlas is that it does not cover the Pacific theater, since my main interest is in European Theater Battles.

It is like reading a book with text, pictures, and maps.  It is full of information.  The biggest draw back to this book is the map colors.  The only colors you will see is black, gray, red, pink, &amp; white.	2003-04-07

It includes text, pictures, and great looking maps.  This book has the best color maps of any WWII atlas I own (The Historical atlas of WWII, The Cassell  Atlas of the second world war, &amp; West Point atlas for the second world war Europe &amp; the Mediterranean)	2003-04-07

It covers his youth, his personal accounts of WWII &amp; his captivity after the war.  The book was really good.  The action was great and Knappe getting bounced around so often due to different assignments was surprising.  It was hard to put the book down while reading it.  The end of the book moves slower than the rest (from an action stand point) since he is a POW.  I would definitely buy this book again!!	2003-04-07

This is the 1st book I have read about it. With that in mind; I found this book interesting. It is mostly personal stories of G.I's and there wild stories of fighting the Japs. It was very interesting to learn about the Japs tatics that they used, usually at night & also about how feared the Japanese locals & Jap military were deathly afraid to fall into the hands of the Americans. This is part of the reason that 99% of the Japs fought to the death. The book covers fighting on land and at sea. The book also covers the death of Ernie Pyle.	2003-03-30
