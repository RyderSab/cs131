Digital Fortress is easy to pick up and easy to put down. <br /> <br />The book begins like a romance novel. A central character of the book, David Becker, is described as \\"dark-rugged, youthful ... sharp green eyes and wit to match. His strong jaw and taut features reminded Susan (heroine cryptographer for the NSA) of carved marble.\\" Becker, a brilliant foreign language specialist and full professor, has no clue who or what the NSA might be - that is a mere nine pages into the book. <br /> <br />The end of the modern world is at hand. First, because the NSA won't be able to sneak a look at everyone's secrets due to a do-gooder's efforts (misguided of course) to share his unbreakable code. Second, because - well, I won't ruin the story. <br /> <br />Author Dan Brown of The Da Vinci Code, Deception Point and Angels & Demons, fails to provide any real insight into the workings of the NSA, its computers or cryptology. <br /> <br />Digital Fortress was entertaining, but simple. It could have been so much more.   <br /> <br />Two stars. <br />	2005-10-10

Author Anne Seagraves tastefully lifts the veil on prostitution -which is neither glamorized nor portrayed in such a manner so as to make Soiled Doves unreadable.     Seagraves recounts the stories of real \\"working girls\\" - some personalities are recognizable, others are not familiar - all are interesting and yet sad. The short stories cast light on the various classes of the \\"trade\\", their impact on the economy and culture of the West.    Soiled Doves includes lots of pictures, which add personality to the text.    Although the subject matter is handled carefully, the book is likely not appropriate for all readers. I would rate the book a heavy PG-13 or light R.    My only criticism of the book is that Seagraves tends to let absolutes creep into her writing, using \\"all\\" and \\"every\\" instead of \\"most\\" and \\"generally\\". This is a minor annoyance. A few reviewers are critical of the sophistication of the writing -I am not. The book is a compilation of short stories - it is not a dissertation. Author Seagraves does include a bibliography and a list of journals, magazines and dissertations for the reader who wishes to read more about the subject.    Four stars.	2005-09-05

Strange death arrives early. This book is not for the squeamish. <br /> <br />Pendergast believes that the bad guy is his genius brother with whom he has a near Cain and Able relationship. Wits are matched, unmatched and matched again.   <br /> <br />Thankfully, in Dance of Death the authors have avoided their distracting tendency to repeat unusual words. My only annoyance is with Dance of Death is minor - Pendergast has the notion that he knows better than everybody else what he should share. This includes D'Agosta. It is silly, unnecessary drama. Even upon reflection it does not make sense. But then, I am getting picky! <br /> <br />I noticed one typo in the first edition.

The starships are all heading to a very distance planet, Ymir. Building Harlequin's Moon is the story of the first starship to flee, John Glen. <br /> <br />An error results in John Glen having to stop along the way to collect additional antimatter. This requires the construction of a ring collider in a habitable environment. No such planet exists within reach.  <br /> <br />A John Glen scientist pushes several moons and comets together while his fellow travelers sleep in a deep regenerating freeze. Eventually, Harlequin Moon stabilizes enough for human life.  <br /> <br />The Moon is terraformed with the help of limited nanotechnology and then populated with humans from John Glen who give birth to \\"Moon Born\\". The sole purpose of the Moon Born is to build a collider to collect antimatter so that the John Glen can continue onto its goal, Ymir.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the John Glen can not take any more passengers and the Moon is not stable enough to perpetually be the home of humans. Building Harlequin's Moon is a story of fear, dreams, relationships, decisions and death. It ends well, but I did not want it to end at all. <br /> <br />I look forward to a prequel or sequel. <br /> <br />Five stars. <br /> <br />	2005-07-11

I admit, cycling does (did) not particularly interest me. That confessed, I have followed the Tour De France from the days of Greg LeMond enough to know who wins.    Armstrong's story of growing up with a single parent, surviving cancer, falling in love, winning the Tour De France and having a child is detailed in \\"It's Not about the Bike\\" and is riveting in its frankness. Armstrong does not attempt to be politically correct and his humanity touches the reader.    I have had this book sitting unread on my bookshelf for several years. That is regrettable.     I was slightly amused and then saddened when reading passages in the book about Kristen, Lance's love, wife and mother of his three children.

(Second Edition) is written from a Hawaiian Islands perspective, but includes tsunamis from around the world. A large portion of the book is devoted to recounting the experiences of individuals who witnessed a tsunami firsthand. Many of the stories survivors shared have been intertwined by the authors, providing a panoramic view of the cataclysmic events.    In addition to the collection of personal experiences, the reader will find a \\"simplified summary of recent (pre-1999) tsunami research findings,\\" a discussion of the development of warning systems and big picture view of tsunamis on earth through the millennia.      The authors have included a large number of illustrations depicting the destruction and tragedy caused by various tsunamis. For the reader inclined to further research the topic, the book includes a dozen pages of references in a bibliography and suggested readings.     (Note: I purchased this book in 2003 while on holiday in the Hawaiian Islands after reading a local newspaper story about a tourist who was washed off a beach and drowned by a rogue wave. Upon returning home, the unread book found its way into my small mountain range of books to be read, someday. There it stayed until the recent Sumatra tsunami. Reading Tsunami! was like reading the coverage of an event in the newspaper and the weekly news magazine simultaneously -  breaking and in-depth.)

Alex Spanos, an immigrant's son, lives the American dream. The 2004 Forbes 400 places Spanos at number 260 with an estimated net worth of $1,100,000,000. This book, written a few years ago, is the story of Spanos' life through August 2001.     When Spanos describes his childhood and youth under his parents' roof, he is very respectful of his parents, but he does not pull any punches when describing his unsuccessful efforts to gain the respect of his father - both as a young man and later in life. In fact, Spanos is not shy about sharing any of his efforts that do not achieve the result he initially intended. He strives to make his \\"failures\\" in life learning experiences and thus not really failures.    Spanos shares the story of his life, from his father's bakery to the owner's suite of the San Diego Chargers. Throughout the book Spanos sprinkles his understanding as to why he has been financially successful. Generously, the last chapter of the book is devoted to what Spanos believes are the fundamentals of success. It doesn't get any easier.    Five stars and a bag of chips.	2005-02-01

A mere 33 days after Albino Luciani became Pope John Paul I, he died. To the date, the cause of death remains unknown or at least it remains undisclosed to the public. No autopsy was preformed. No official certificate of death was released.      Author David Yallop follows the footsteps of Albino Luciani and chronicles his life and journey to Rome. Yallop reveals the process and speculates on the politics of the election of John Paul I.  His investigation provides a detailed sketch of the final hours of Pope John Paul I, drawn minute by minute.     In the book, Yallop names six individuals who had much to lose under the reign of John Paul I. He asserts that these individuals: a Bishop; two Cardinals; two bankers; and the head of a secret organization, P2; applied the \\"Italian Solution\\" either alone or in some combination. Now twenty years after this book was first published the author's website claims that the central questions raised remain unanswered and the frightening accusations are still undisputed.     I found Yallop's development of the cases of motive for the six suspects to be strong. Although motive does not equal guilt, it does help make Yallop's theory of murder plausible. At a minimum this book is an interesting story to read along with Dan Brown's \\"Angels & Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". The possibility that Yallop has uncovered the truth is unsettling. I have penciled \\"In God's Name\\" near the top of my rather extensive list of conspiracy theory books and unreservedly give it five stars.    Wonderfully, author Yallop has included pictures, lots of them. I noticed at least one reviewer commented about the durability of the book. My copy is a first edition, published in 1984. It has also been read by several friends and other than the paper jacket, remains in excellent condition.	2005-01-10

Disclaimer: I am neither a practicing Catholic nor was I raised as a Catholic.     I noticed this book on the bargain table at a local book store, read the jacket and the table of contents and I was intrigued. The book is divided into four sections: Historical Dishonesties; Doctrinal Dishonesties; The Honesty Issue; and The Splendor Of Truth. I recommend using the \\"search inside this book\\" option to review the table of contents and the first chapter.    I found this book a challenge. I read a chapter or two and then did not pick up the book for weeks. At times reading Papal Sin was laborious, yet like physical exercise the mental exercise was beneficial. Of particular interest were the chapters on women (Excluded Women), celibacy of priests (The Pope's Eunuch's and Priestly Caste), priests as sex offenders (Conspiracy of Silence), homosexuality (A Gay Priesthood) and contraception (The Gift of Life).     To a non-Catholic, Papal Sin is educational and fascinating. To a devote Catholic who believes in the infallibility of the Pope, this book is likely blasphemous.      Four plus stars.	2005-01-02

This book is frightening if true. The premise, set forth in the introduction and detailed in the book, is that the US government has used experimental vaccines from the Desert Shield / Storm era through today on GI's and other individuals. Author Gary Matsumoto methodically - sometimes excruciatingly so - grinds through facts and builds a circumstantial case supported by nearly 60 pages of endnotes.     Matsumoto was the first writer to publish a connection between the anthrax vaccine and the Gulf War Syndrome, doing so in an article published in Vanity Fair in 1999. His book, Vaccine A, is the spawn of that article.    Matsumoto does not have an evident bias of distrust in the US government or even the military. He acknowledges the need to develop and use a vaccine effective against anthrax. He is even willing to understand the failure to obtain knowing consent from those injected with an unlicensed vaccine due to the exigent nature of the Gulf conflict and the fear of biological agents in the possession of Saddam Hussein - at least initially.    As his investigation progresses, Matsumoto learns that one of the ingredients of Vaccine A (anthrax vaccine) is squalene. This oily substance is an adjuvant that stimulates the immune system. Unfortunately, this oil too closely resembles oils found in the body and as a result, the body's immune system begins to attack itself. This causes a plethora of autoimmune diseases.     Disturbingly, it appears that a wealth of scientific knowledge about the dangers of squalene was available to a thorough researcher prior to the Gulf War. Even more disturbing is the unwillingness of the US military to acknowledge more than ten years later the fact that squalene in Vaccine A caused a large number of \\"casualties\\".     Matsumoto asserts that the US has stockpiled 75,000,000 doses of Vaccine A with squalene for future use by the military and civilians. He further assets that the several other vaccines have been or are in the process of being developed with the adjuvant of squalene.    At times, this book is like reading a textbook - it is grueling. However, the acquired knowledge is worth the effort. This book should be read (or at least the introduction) by anybody who has family or friends in the military or is contemplating a career in the military. Apparently, enemy fire and friendly fire are not the only risks of military service.    In the \\"how I would improve this book\\" category I suggest photographs of key individuals mentioned in the book. Also, it would be helpful include a complete copy of the insert that accompanies the current anthrax vaccine.    A tough book to read - but five stars all the same.	2004-12-28

At times that suspense carries the plot and at other times it is the detail. Preston Child fans are accustomed to thoroughly researched storylines and this book does not disappoint. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book immensely and if you occasionally buy books in hardback rather than wait for the paperback edition, this is one that is worth the expense. <br /> <br />In the \\"how I would improve this book\\" category is the elimination of the annoying habit of the authors to incorporate a unique or particularly effective visual word on multiple occasions in close proximity. In this book the word is \\"cadaverousness\\" on page 32 and \\"cadaverous\\" on page 40. Editors, please do your job! <br /> <br />I noticed at least one reviewer was critical of some of the chases in the book opining their inclusion was merely a pretext for the movie. I would enjoy a movie with the chases and they certainly did not lessen my enjoying the book. The story does end with a loose end or two. They will undoubtedly be tied in a subsequent tale, which is one of the inherent problems of reoccurring characters - their immorality. It is too painful to kill the franchise. <br /> <br />	2004-12-26

I was not disappointed.  <br /> <br />Jackson writes this book in journal form and often skips days or even weeks at a time. He rambles and muses. The reader can not help but wonder how much editing was done after the fact. Regardless, it is like being a fly on Jackson's therapist's wall. It is an entertaining read even if not particularly news. Some re-runs are worth watching. <br /> <br />Jackson doesn't give up the dirt on Kobe and certainly not Shaq. He does mention weaknesses in his players and others, but he generally balances his criticism with a compliment. The cynic in me wonders what Jackson would write if he knew he would never coach again and could remain hidden in Montana for the rest of his life. <br /> <br />This book is an easy read.

The story follows a Jewish girl (Hadassah) who is taken captive by the Romans when they sacked Jerusalem and a German tribal warrior (Atretes) captured in the forests. Hadassah, a Christian, is sold as a slave to a wealthy family in Rome. Atretes, a very large and attractive blond German, is sold to a Roman who supplies gladiators for the arena. <br /> <br />Although Roman is tolerant of many forms of religion, Christianity is illegal. Hadassah struggles to serve her mistress while obeying her own conscious. Hadassah's mistress is an insufferable hedonist who is a poor judge of character. Following her life has the makings of a Roman soap opera, amusing, sad and at times, annoying. <br /> <br />Atretes trains for the arena. He is strong-bodied and strong-willed. His exploits provide a sense of the minimum value Romans of that era placed on human life. The trappings and activities of the arena are described with sufficient detail to be rated PG-13 or even a light R.  <br /> <br />At least one reviewer faults Hadassah's character as being too morally correct and unromantic. I disagree. I found Hadassah's character simple like her unencumbered and un-institutionalized Christian beliefs - simply refreshing. <br />  <br />This is a very entertaining historical novel written from the perspective of a Christian author.  <br /> <br />A solid four stars. <br />	2004-11-02

Patterson paints a chorus of liberal Democrats as consistently viewing the US military as increasingly unnecessary in the modern world. Hit piece or not, American voters of all stripes will be well served by reading Reckless Disregard and asking whether a strong US military is more likely with Kerry or Bush residing in the White House? Under which man's leadership will America be safer today and tomorrow?   <br /> <br />Author Lt. Col. Robert \\"Buzz\\" Patterson, USAF, Retired, is passionate about his respect for the USA military. From his perspective liberal Democrats - Carter, Clintons, Gore, Kerry and Ted Kennedy - are dangerous leaders in that they either do not understand or care about the military, or both.  <br /> <br />Considering Reckless Disregard as a whole, the book is worth reading. However, it is a bit disappointing when compared to Patterson's Dereliction Of Duty (reviewed 8/16/2004). Patterson's earlier book is a first person account whereas Reckless Disregard has significant portions either authored by others or is reprinted material.  <br /> <br />I found the appendix to be a valuable addition to the book, although the font size of the reprint of President Bush's National Security Strategy is too small and the quality of the print of John Kerry's testimony makes the reading tedious. This is unfortunate and careless editing.  <br /> <br />JMO <br /> <br />	2004-09-29

A non Christian reader will have to settle for three out of four. <br /> <br />Although the story line is entirely predictable, author Francine Rivers tells it so well that the reader is drawn into the tale and can hardly wait for the inevitable to happen.

Reichert's story is a testament to the importance of crime investigators' dogged pursuit of little details and never giving up. This true crime story offers an opportunity to vicariously experience the lows and highs that were experienced by a person who was making decisions. <br /> <br />In his book, Reichert describes some of his contact with the victim's families. I found these snippets to be fascinating as they provided a glimpse of the understandably volatile emotions of the families of the young girls murdered by the Green River Killer and the personal struggle of Reichert and other dedicated individuals to find for them some sense of closure. <br /> <br />The book includes a number of photographs which attach faces to some of the names, they are a definite plus. I would have appreciated a simple map that displayed the Green River Killer's pick-up zone (The Strip), the body dump zones and the neighborhood the Green River Killer resided. <br /> <br />Finally, a word of caution . . . . I do not recommend reading this book shortly before sleeping. While Reichert's prose are not disgusting in an over-the-top manner, they are graphic enough to this father to bother sleep patterns. <br /> <br />	2004-08-26

Several characters are well developed, leaving the reader sad or perhaps relieved when one or more predictably dies in the course of the war time novel.    The story is simple but believable and does not require the reader to completely ignore history to enjoy the book. The length of the paperback is 500 + pages and provides hours of escape to a time most readers are glad they never lived.    This book is definitely not Follet's most detailed or intense, but well worth reading if you enjoy war novels, spy thrillers with light romance.    3  Stars	2004-08-23

Conservatives and Republicans love this book and naturally, liberals and Democrats discover a bad taste. Dereliction Of Duty by Lieutenant Colonel Robert \\"Buzz\\" Patterson, USAF (Retired), deserves more than just being cast into or out of a particular camp.  <br /> <br />I found the descriptions of the nuclear football and how it was handled during the Clinton administration fascinating. If you want to read about Bill Clinton's extra marital relationships, this book is not for you. <br /> <br />Dereliction of Duty should be read for what it is, an eyewitness account. Every witness views events from his or her own perspective. I believe that Patterson's strongest perspective is not his being a conservative, but rather his military profession. Duty and honor are paramount. Most would agree that \\"duty and honor\\" is not the best description of former president Bill Clinton.  <br /> <br />This is a short book that is quickly read and is steeply priced at $27.95.

The lack of detail regarding a particular trade (there are only a couple transactions) intrigued me as I expected the secret to that success to be revealed later. <br /> <br />I would like to read a fast paced novel about a day trader that detailed days of success and days of losses and frustration. The Day Trader is not that novel. However, it is entertaining and worth reading for that purpose and as an average read rates three stars. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-08-16

This book clearly has been widely read. If you spend a few minutes reading the reviews, you will not need (want?) to read Grisham's tale. Skip the reviews.<br /><br />You either like Grisham books or do not. If you do like Grisham and have a sense of humor, you will enjoy this book - even in August.<br /><br />The plot is simple. A stuffy accountant (Luther Krank) calculates exactly how much the family spent on Christmas the preceding year and discusses it with a partner at work. If you know an accountant (or are one) you can imagine how Grisham's description of these events could be simply hysterical. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Mr. Krank decides he would rather skip Christmas and spend the money saved on a Caribbean cruise. Now if he can only sell his wife on the notion. The convincing, then doing it and dealing with the neighbors and seemingly the whole town is the substance of this book.<br /><br />It is a short story that is rapidly read.

The plot, yes there is a real plot, evolves around the Silicon Valley in the late `70s and the emergence of the computer and nerd nirvana. The story is fascinating. It is nostalgic - where were you when Elvis died? <br />I read Hot Shot because I was told that I would like it. I was really skeptical. \\"Give it chance\\", it was suggested.

With the criminal trial for sexual assault against Kobe Bryant expected to proceed later this summer (2004), Out of Bounds is timely. Unfortunately, Benedict's effort to be timely (write and research the book in less than six months wherein \\"missing a deadline was not an option\\") was not without cost. The book is sloppily proofread - \\"Stockhouse\\" on page 17, \\"an (sic) famous athlete's bed\\" on page 58 are a couple examples.<br />Benedict asserts that 40% of the 177 players researched from the 2001-2002 NBA roster \\"had been arrested or otherwise recommended by police to prosecuting attorneys for indictment for serious crime.\\" Truly a startling statistic! Unfortunately, about half of the book is devoted to just three players - Ruben Patterson, Sam Mack and Glen Robinson. (Shaquille O'Neal is given about a half dozen pages in the introduction.) Although nearly 70 players would have been identified as \\"out of bounds\\" during Benedict's research, a quick count turns up about 20 names of NBA players in the book. Undoubtedly, other players are named, but it would take a very careful line by line review of the book to determine who they are as Benedict does not include an index of the players he mentions.  <br />Out of Bounds attempts to detail a truly disturbing trend in the NBA. As lightly written as it is, the collection of bad incidents should be required reading for every NBA owner, league official and employee. <br />Is the bad behavior more prevalent now or is it less ignored? That question remains unanswered.<br />Sadly, little ink is devoted to solutions and policy suggestions - certainly if Benedict did not have the time to develop his own suggestions he could have found a myriad of NBA officials, owners, coaches, current and former players or even fans to interview.<br />Out of Bounds is disappointing in that it could have been so much better. Itreads more a like commercial deadline driven book than one where the author is concerned with the depth and quality of his work. It is unfortunate. Benedict has the credentials to have done so much better.<br />Just my opinion . . . .	2004-07-13

The Last Run is a story of dedication, greed, tenacity and heroism. Dedication of investigators to match miniscule remains to a missing person. Greed of fishermen to catch just a few more before heading back to port and safety from the storm. Tenacity of fishermen cast adrift in bone chilling water fighting towering waves and hurricane force wind until help arrived. Heroism of Coast Guard search and rescue.  A true story of human struggle and redemption.<br />Author Todd Lewan commences his drama with a CSI-like investigation and segues ways into painting portraits of the five fishermen who later find themselves together on a sinking fishing ship in the middle of an Alaskan hurricane. The portraits he paints have the blemishes of real men who came to Alaska hoping to be allowed a second or third chance or perhaps, just the opportunity to survive.<br />The last half of the book is a fast paced drama of the men fishing, fighting the storm, running from the storm and then not escaping. As the fishermen are repeatedly (every 10-15 seconds) entombed in towering waves, the reader anxiously waits for the Coast Guard to arrive on scene and commence the rescue. The tension builds and builds and though the ultimate ending is told in the first few pages of the book - the reader needs to know what really happened and finds no comfort in the foreshadowing.<br />The story is masterfully told. It starts fast, slogs along for a bit while the characters are developed and then roars along chapter after chapter.<br />Author Lewan deserves kudos for including a map of the Alaskan region early in the book and later, pictures of the main characters. The map is helpful in tracking the story and the pictures put a face on the words. <br />What I would do to improve the book? I would change very little. Perhaps, include more information about the Coast Guard helicopters. An appendix with a detailed drawing of a helicopter described in the book would be interesting. Maybe a picture of a guardsman in rescue gear or an aerial photograph of the Coast Guard base would add to the story.	2004-07-09

Although Across The Sea Of Suns was first published twenty years ago, it is still good. Twenty years of evolving science, medicine and technology have not turned this book into an annoying or worse yet, humorous, science fiction. This is book two of the six book Galactic Center Series. I have not read the other five books in the series, but I have added them to my list of books I want read. <br />In 2064 the starship Lancer is launched to investigate near earth stars. A dozen years or so later, the Lancer approaches its first target. The life aboard the starship is described in enough detail to be interesting but is not plot-numbingly exhaustive. The relationships of the characters develop and change as the years pass. The crew faces challenges with both success and failure. While the Lancer travels through space, Earth is having its own challenges. Author Benford alternates between following Lancer and Earth. I thoroughly enjoyed the Lancer plot, but I found myself looking ahead to discover how many pages I would read of the Lancer plot before returning to Earth.<br />A one page star chart at the beginning of the book is helpful in following the Lancer's travels. A timeline at the end of the book is an interesting summary. <br />Warner Books published a paperback edition in 2004, so it will not be necessary to purchase a used copy of this book. I have not read the first book of the series, In The Ocean Of The Night, (yet), but if available to you, I would read that book before reading this one.	2004-07-07

Some reviewers pan it as a work of fiction. You owe it to yourself to read this book and decide for yourself. <br />James Bamford asserts that the current Bush administration commenced its service with an agenda to topple Saddam Hussein, end involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and rearrange the dominoes in the Middle East. Bamford's premise is that the Bush administration, with the able assistance of its neo-conservatives previously employed by the Israeli government, manipulated the inadequate intelligence it received to increase public support for its war on Iraq. Along the way, tax dollars were used illegally to propagandize American citizens while the inept US media mutely watched. Additionally, the NSA spied on the UN Security Council and Hans Blix, the chief of the Iraq weapons inspectors. <br />Despite the complexity of the story author James Bamford writes, A Pretext For War is very readable and in fact is very interesting. Initially, Bamford follows the 9/11 terrorists and then the President and other US officials. The second section of the book traces the intelligence gathering. The third and final section of watches the Bush administration as it weaves the events, gathered intelligence and speculation into a tapestry of its own design<br />I recommend the well written reviews posted by Robert D. Steele and \\"autonomeus\\".<br />In the \\"how I would improve this book\\" category, I would like to have read more on the FBI / CIA turf battle over the terrorist investigations. In particular, more details about John P. O'Neill who headed the bureau's Counterterrorism Division. Finally, the noted fact that George Tennet, as Director of the CIA only controlled 15% of America's intelligence empire while Donald Rumsfield as Secretary of Defense controlled 85% of the intelligence was mentioned twice in the book (p 214 &amp; p 353).

The heart wrenching story culminates with Frank committing suicide while incarcerated. <br />This real life account sheds light on some of the failings in the medical / mental treatment provided inmates. More importantly, it offers a view of a mental condition little understood by most. A reader will glimpse the frustration and confusion that an individual who suffers bipolar disorder experiences and the helplessness felt by family and friends.<br />This is a well written personal story.

I thoroughly enjoyed Jon Krakauer's earlier book &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;. I was equally entertained / informed by &quot;Under the Banner of Heaven&quot;. Many of the &quot;reviews&quot; that I read about this book are not really reviews. These purported &quot;reviews&quot; are either attacks or defenses of Mormonism, with several only mentioning the book and a few not at all. If you are a reader looking for a book to read about Mormonism, I think that these attacks and defenses are evidence that Krakauer has hit a nerve. This book incites passions.<br />Krakauer weaves into a historical review of the genesis and subsequent evolution (further enlightenment?) of Mormonism the 1980's Lafferty boys' murderous rampage and the recent Elizabeth Smart story. Those without &quot;faith&quot; will have difficulty understanding how some of Joseph Smith's assertions pass the laugh test. Those with and without faith will be appalled by the description of the circumstances that led to the followers of Joseph Smith to flee to Utah. (A public apology for this event was issued shortly after Krakauer's book was released.) The author later details a subsequent massacre by the allegedly faithful of a wagon train passing through Utah.<br />The author intertwines the lightening rod topic of polygamy throughout the book. But, the book is much more than an examination of polygamy. <br />I am not a Mormon. I am not a former Mormon. That stated, I recommend this book to anybody who would like a historical and evolving view of the Mormon religion. Krakauer has obviously done a lot of research. This book is one individual's view of history. Every individual has at least a slightly different interpretation of the same events and often a different measure to determine what is significant enough to even interpret.   <br />I gave this book five stars not because I necessarily subscribe to Krakauer's interpretation of history, but because he tells an interesting story that has certainly incited fervor in believers and non believers alike.	2004-06-24

The investigation is the backbone of the book.<br />One reviewer described this book as \\"ponderous\\" and I agree. The book is long and at times the detail is deep - for some maybe, too deep.

I want to be annoyed about the book because it is a rip-off of another plot / premise and follows a stereo-typical forensic psychologist who has mental and human demons and an ex-wife - definitely a tired character - but I can not. This book was too entertaining. I enjoyed the read.<br />A double suicide involving a dating service's clients causes a company (Eden, Inc.) to become concerned and they hire Christopher Lash, a former FBI forensic psychologist. His private investigation of these deaths (and others) is the substance of the book. To describe more would steal some of the suspense.<br />It is a small thing, but in the \\"how I would improve the book\\" category, I would reduce the author's usage of the uncommon word \\"unrelieved.\\" It was distracting. Author Child describes a hall as \\"unrelievedly white\\" on page 67. When it popped up again on page 222 to describe a building as \\"unrelievedly modern,\\" I turned down the page corner.

A premise of Richard Mahoney's \\"Getting Away With Murder\\" is that U. S. attorney cut a plea deal with \\"American Taliban,\\" John Walker Lindh, at least in part because the U.S. government did not want a public airing of its illegal dealings with the Taliban. Mahoney's marshalling of the facts supports his premise.<br />The book starts in a fortress near Mazar-e Sharif, Afghanistan, with Mike Spann and Dave Tyson, CIA paramilitary commandos, interrogating non-Afghan Taliban prisoners shortly before the prison riot that claimed Spann's life and ends with Lindh's sentencing hearing. Sandwiched in between these events, author Mahoney reviews how America has enabled - even sponsored - terrorism, the crusade of counterterrorist  FBI agent John O'Neill, and the how Lindh arrived in Afghanistan.<br />Most of the allegations detailed in the book of governmental incompetence, too cozy U.S. government and specific public servants' relations with Saudi Arabia, its royal family and the Taliban have already found their way into the public consciousness. However, author Mahoney does an excellent job organizing the information in an interesting and coherent manner. More than 30 pages of notes follow.<br />Readers who refuse to acknowledge that those in the service of the public and the agencies they toil for make mistakes and do at least on occasion overstep, will dismiss this book. An open-minded reader will at moments believe author Mahoney has become overly critical and at other moments become angry about events detailed in the book. Conspiracy theorists will have a field day.<br />Overall, I found this book well worth the price and my time. My only real criticism is minor. I find a book more enjoyable when it includes pictures of the major figures and maps of the areas detailed in the book. Sadly, no pictures or maps are found in the book - at least not in the first edition.	2004-06-01

Regardless of your political persuasion, I recommend The Halliburton Agenda. Author Dan Briody follows Erle Halliburton's career from the oil fields as a driver in the early 1900's to the boardrooms where in the 1920's Halliburton was already a millionaire. During the same era brothers, Herman and George, founders of Brown & Root, the predecessor of the modern day Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) that is now a subsidiary of Halliburton, began as road builders and garbage haulers in Texas and graduated to dam builders and became a major government contractor as they learned to work the political system.<br />The ties between the Brown brothers and politicians, most notably Lyndon Johnson, are revealed in some detail. It is a fascinating view. The ups and downs of KBR are followed through the decades as the construction firm lands contract after contract. <br />Early on, author Briody makes a strong effort to keep his opinions - if not his perspective - off the pages. Unfortunately later in the book, he does not stick to the facts, but occasionally opines.  An example of this editorializing is found on page 211 when discussing Dick Cheney Briody states \\"Either way, he's not the man I want bending the president's ear on a daily basis.\\" I would have preferred coming to that conclusion on my own.<br />Overall, the book has a good deal of balance with Briody giving space to others praising Halliburton's while raising questions about the LOGCAP (Logistics Civil Augmentation Program) design and bidding process.  <br />I like timelines, charts and pictures. Unfortunately, this book has none. A timeline of the successes and failures with a listing of the contracts would be a nice addition to the book. Also, photographs of the major players and construction projects would add flavor.	2004-05-24

On more than one occasion, I reviewed the map of the region that provides a graphic depiction of the Osirak attack route, neighboring countries, major cities, rivers and bodies of water.<br />The story is well told. However, I would have appreciated more detail about France's assistance with Iraq's nuclear program and the economic details of the relationship.

US	30539015	R1SN5X98C9IFSN	0446608378	270870625	Thunderhead	Books	4	0	1	N	N	An Archeological Thriller	This book, co-authored by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, is an archeological thriller. The heroine, Nora Kelly, leads a team in search a lost city of early inhabitants of North America. Ms. Kelly is also on a personal mission as she hopes to find an explanation for the disappearance of her father many years before.<br />The archeology is spiced with the supernatural, science and some romance. Even though the plot, including some of the twists and turns, is predictable, I still found this book to be an irresistible page turner. <br />This book is good entertainment, even if the minor romance thread borders on silly and is a stereotypical middle age male fantasy.	2004-05-01
US	30539015	R3TYRUTGWPF7W8	0786886994	728258902	Ice Bound: A Doctor's Incredible Battle For Survival at the South Pole	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Tale of courage	The book cover proclaims \\"A doctor's incredible battle for survival at the South Pole.\\" Indeed, the battle for survival is incredible and heartwarming.     The life Dr. Nielsen and her companions lived and others continue to live at the South Pole is described in fascinating detail.    The book is worth your time. However, I recommend skimming through any section of the book that seems to drag or you find annoying.      In my reading, I found the author's description of her circumstances and reasoning for her need to escape traditional civilization a bit annoying. In addition, some of the reprinted email exchanges added little if anything to the story - except weight to the book.	2004-04-19

Crichton mixes an old formula with new science.<br />The finish is written as if the Crichton has a deadline to meet. Definitely, unsatisfying for a Michael Crichton read. <br />Fortunately, for the reader, a bad Crichton book is better than most other authors seem able to generate on a good day.<br />Reduce your expectations and the book will be satisfying.	2004-04-19

It is laced with violence and death, spiced with thought provoking sermons about capturing family moments and sprinkled with not so subtle jabs at the business of war and some thereby employed.<br />If you need Spock-like logical characters, this tale is not for you. Patterson's Detective Cross will annoy you when he repeatedly puts himself in harm's way - sometimes alone. Likely equally annoying will be the fact the Patterson does not slow the plot by taking time to explain how Detective Cross and his partner John Sampson are able to spend weeks solving crime(s) with no apparent connection to the District of Columbia - their employer.<br />Read for entertainment, not to escape the ugliness that life brings to some.	2004-04-07
