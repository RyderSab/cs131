Some go as far as to become poets, linguists, philologists. Others become fluent in obscure languages to acquaint themselves with the literary legacies of long-gone peoples (and understand Enya's lyrics in the process). Word by word, each one crafts his peculiar voice, the quality that makes the author's writing unmistakable. Precocious Amelia has no such voice of her own. She uses short words, and she uses long words, but no matter how hard she tries, her writing stays flat on the page, as lifeless and uninvolving as any other hack writer's.<br />This is a key point: Atwater-Rhodes is a real writer. She has the mechanical skill, and her prose reads quickly and evenly (partly because of the size of the print and the extremely small pages). But she simply does not challenge herself. Amelia can gauge her abilities, and does not overextend (unlike, say, the young Anselm Audley, whose unpremeditated foray into the world of multivolume fantasy has produced a lumbering disaster), but her second novel is written entirely on auto-pilot. One YA cliche dictates another, and before the 100-odd-page book shows a glimmer of meaning, it is over. \\"Demon In My View\\" is easily the most contrived and artificial read in recent memory. No character is explored in any depth, no relationship is substantiated, no idea is given legs to stand on. Her millennia-old vampires act like sulky teens, and no rambling about proud bloodlines and anaesthetic saliva can change that. The author seems intent on destroying any possible suspense. The very moment sporty teenage agents of darkness move into Ramsa High, the narration switches over to their perspective, so we can listen in on the telepathic conversations and find out the backstory.<br />The heavy lugubrium is easily funnier. The characters are never established as personalities, and they simply cannot be taken seriously as they amble about, spitting paltry curses (\\"Bite me!\\") and tightly-wadded bits of dialog that positively drips with sarcasm. This is especially funny during a combat scene that lasts fully two chapters.<br />In other authors' work you can find evidence of rich, full lives, obscure kowledge, professional tidbits, personal insights. As David Gerrold confides in his \\"The Martian Child\\", even the earthquake that has just destroyed your house is source material for a writer. \\"Demon In My View\\", on the other hand, could have been pulled out of thin air, and probably was. Dull, inane, meaningless.<br />P.S.: Every novel of this sort must include a line of vicarious gratification. Here is Amelia's - \\"Jessica well knew she had a body and a face to die for.\\" And, as another reviewer has noted, the way Jessica ignores her mother's death is absolutely disgusting.	2002-07-18

The camera obscura is housed in a small, box-like, concrete building atop a hill overlooking the ocean surf. The only clues that it isn't a storage shed or a utility space are the worlds - GIANT CAMERA -- painted in black on one side. Which is precisely what the device is -- a giant camera. A series of mirrors reflects the panorama of the Pacific onto a screen in the center of the dark chamber, creating an image that is almost magical in its beauty. It is a sight that has sparked deadly rivalry. It has driven men mad. It has claimed lives. In fact, it's still doing it... right now.<br />Near the end of my first reading of Knowles' esceptional novella, I asked myself: what authority does the author have to recast the major figures of history as deviants and scoundrels? Does the end result justify his means? In my humble opinion, the answer is a resounding &quot;yes!&quot;. Underneath an insipid and meandering exterior, Knowles' novella is a gem of precise plotting, polished tone, and bizarre vignettes (one character is described as having invented the submarine &quot;to escape the world of women on land&quot;). It takes real talent to write something so consistently humorous and puzzling, even upon re-reading (in fact, I suggest reading the book twice - it's a mere 138 pages long, a night's reading).<br />Even the author's mundane, conversational language and the little, irritating, anachronistic faux-pas he commits so frequently (like art &quot;yet to be hung&quot; on the walls of Leonardo's Vatican, or sugar cubes in Vermeer's Delft) and his main character tries to pass off as historical truth serve to gradually estblish the narrator as a less than sympathetic  character.<br />In the end, the book boils down to the question whether the camera does indeed bear an ancient curse, or if the &quot;patterns of history&quot; are siply products of an agitated imagination. I lean toard the latter, that the narrator is playing out his fantasies in his research journals, butthere is no real, unequivocable evidence either way. Then again, who is the blind woman in the photograph? Is Darin as innocent as he claims? What did happen on that foggy night? It's easy to jump to the obvious conclusion, but far more tantalizing to ponder the possibilities.<br />For what it's worth reading, &quot;The Secrets of the Camera Obscura&quot; is worth reading twice. I hope I have helped you make the decision whether it's worth reading at all.	2002-06-06

On the eve of interstellar war, seven travellers set out on the last pilgrimage to the Time Tombs of Hyperion: the Priest, the Soldier, the Poet, the Scholar, the Navigator, the Detective, and the Consul. Each has been in some way touched by the planet's curse. Each is compelled - by love, guilt, passion, duty, or fear - to return to the beginning place and petition the deadliest, most inhuman creature in the universe to grant him his one wish. One of the seven is a spy for the enemy. The success (or failure) of their expedition will determine the fate of three civilizations.<br />Yes, there is no denying that \\"Hyperion\\" is the work of a master. Dan Simmons is a more than capable writer, versatile, talented, with a wide range of influences. His style is bold, engaging, and assertive (he has a Hugo to show for it).<br />There is also no denying that \\"Hyperion\\" is an ambitious, highly original novel. It is a rich bouillabaisse of genres and narrative structures, loosely adapting the form of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and filling it with jungle adventure worthy of H. Rider Haggard, Philip K. Dickian idiosyncratic mirages, gritty hard-boiled detective fiction, and human drama on par with Card and LeGuin at their best. With a manifold novel like this, variety is at least part of the fun. Simmons perfectly maintains the tones and personalities of his characters, and each of the pilgrims' tales is truly independent.<br />However, enjoyment isn't part of the recipe. Underneath the trappings of a whiz-bang space opera, the first novel in Simmons' quartet is a subtly repulsive dystopia. The author's galaxy-spanning world-web is a consumerist paradise that has so thoroughly rejected any notion of social conscience, and is filled with such inane, mindless accessory characters, that it is difficult to imagine how it came about. \\"Hyperion\\" leaves the reader with no hope for humanity. The novel's mood is perhaps best expressed in its first image: that of a man passionately playingRachmaninoff on a Steinway while the alien wilderness surges below against the hull of his ship.<br />Furthermore, it takes a conscious effort to come to terms with the fact that \\"Hyperion\\" is told almost entirely through flashbacks, while the central narrative does not really begin until the second book. And while it is useless to complain about the cliffhanger ending, the author might have chosen a more dramatic place to cut off the narrative.<br />Lastly, entire sections of the book reek of the arrogance of an overindulgent author who is aware of his brilliance. In tale after tale Simmons plumbs the depths of raunchy sex and bad imitative verse (even going as far as to dedicate the sequel to John Keats). Dollops of sophomoric cynicism and non-stop profanity float here and there.<br />Out of the six tales in \\"Hyperion\\", I found three to be unreadable, repetitive, and highly pedestrian. The other three are sublime. It's up to you to decide which ones.	2002-04-30

I'm prone to get offended when someone calls a favorite book of mine a \\"fun romp.\\" Quite honestly, there is no other way to describe the second book in Patricia Wrede's Enchanted Forest chronicles. The author throws together a handful of screwball characters and a dull, obligatory plot, and cooks up a forgettable sequel that reads like an episode of a Saturday-morning cartoon show, rather than a stand-alone novel.<br />Say what: I'll give Wrede the benefit of the doubt and hazard a guess that \\"Searching\\" was ghostwritten. It certainly feels like an uninspired effort of a second-rate writer. \\"Searching\\" is \\"Dealing\\" distilled to a formula and duplicated. Thus, in the first book Cimorene runs away from home, finds out that living with a dragon isn't all fun and games (but still better than being married off to an air-headed princeling), and thwarts the wizards' dastardly plans to usurp the rulership of the dragons' kingdom. In this second novel we again find a young, worthy character embarking on a quest, meeting another person who severely challenges his preconceptions, forming a tentative union, and thwarting the wizards, who this time around have their eye set on the Enchanted Forest's magic supply. The only difference is that the narrative is now centered on King Mendanbar, a remarkably dry character, while Cimorene (in a vastly diminished form) occupies an insubstantial secondary role. Friendship, and eventually romance between the two seem sudden and far-fetched. Morwen's character is expanded, without great success. The author creates a male counterpart for her, Telemain, whose constant jargon is a major nuisance. Other new characters are introduced, but appear too late in the story to make any real impact.<br />Because of the obligatory non-plot this book is so heavily yoked with, the narrative fairly weezes along. The dialog seems to repeat over and over and over: the characters argue, remind themselves of their goals, urge others to go on, etc. The opening chapaters are largely spent investigating different courses of events, but questions that appear are completely ignored in the end, when everyone is much too busy running around and splashing wizards with soapy water (the possibility of war between the dragons and the Enchanted Forest is mentioned at one point, but quickly forgotten).<br />\\"Searching for Dragons\\" did not answer the one question that I had, which was why the wizards were so perfidious. What malign drive incites them to their machinations? What sort of society produces them? Not much can be deduced from the wizards' last gurgling curses, and they remain the same cardboard villains they were in the previous novel.<br />The book's humor was hit-and-miss. The parody is aimless and inconsistent. Wrede's portrayal of her fantasy realm is hardly original: the Enchanted Forest is a respectable institution that processes adventurers (much like an amusement park processes its clients); the theme was explored better by Diane Wynne Jones' in her \\"The Tough Guide to Fantasyland\\" and Terry Brooks' \\"Magic Kingdom for Sale - Sold!\\". Yes, this is light fantasy, but the first had both ambition and bite, while this one has neither. Two nights of silly fun.	2002-04-17

It is a rare and special book that inspires the reader to respect it, not as an object of art but as a life story of someone we can only know through writing. The truth is, &quot;The Minotaur Takes a Cigarette Break&quot; is much more about the physical, tangible reality of M the Minotaur's experience than it is about the conceptual fact of his existence. A lesser book would incite a flurry of cannibalistic nit-picking; Sherrill's first provokes thought, and perhaps admiration. To dissemble it would be to diminish its accomplishment, and to ruin the experience of reading along with that.<br />Thus, given half a chance, I could go on and on about the branching, tangential nature of the narrative, the stream-of-consciousness writing style, the deft interweaving of near-metaphors (like the irritated scarline that divides the Minotaur's body into black and white halves). But I won't. To do so would be to miss the point. Passages like<br />&quot;The Minotaur watches the crow pull the tissues out of the box until there are no more. Then the bird flies away.&quot;<br />do not feel like artificial devices that the author forcibly introduced into the narrative to feign perspicacity. To misquote artist Paul Klee, Sherrill does not render visible; he renders the vsible. His viewpoint character has no great insights to share. M's vision is all the more piercing precisely because it is unclouded by preconceptions. He is much too human and fallible to achieve any great wisdom, but a lifespan that measures in millennia has eroded what vices and grandeur he once may have possessed.<br />So, how does one address this novel in its integral, atomic entirety? It is a story of several days' events in the Minotaur's lonely, turbulent life. It is a story about cars, and cooking, and dysfunctional families, and abuse, and concealed emotions. It is melancholy, and weary, and real. It is carried by the quality and strength of its imagery (Sherrill's background as a poet is evident in every scent and sound of the Grub's Rib restaurant).<br />A touching, delicate, challenging novel. Highly recommended.	2002-04-14

Princess Cimorene, the youngest of eight, is firmly convinced that she is the only being in Linderwall with a brain in her head. She is, well, different: tall, black-haired, and, to her royal parents' great dipleasure, as stubborn as a mule. She'd rather study sorcery and economics and cooking instead of etiquette or embroidery. Upon finding herself betrothed to the Prince of a neighboring (emphasis on boring) kingdom, she takes a frog's good advice, finds a decrepit hut in the wilderness, and enters just in time for an argument between three voices who may or may not decide to eat her. Thus begins the first story about Cimorene's adventures among the dragonkind.<br />Consistency is a problem for humorous fantasy on the novel scale, and this light-hearted pastiche runs into its share of slow spells. What elevates \\"Dealing with Dragons\\" above the morass of lackluster fantasy is Wrede's energy: she writes with brevity and zest. Still, the book disappoints when it goes from the sparkling fancy of:<br />\\"Speaking of dragons, where's yours?\\" \\"She's gone to the Enchanted Forest to borrow a crepe pan from a witch she knows.\\"<br />to a non-story about sneaky wizards and whatnot. Besides primitive villains who are not even funny, the novel suffers from moments of extreme contrivance: small, irrelevant details are always obvious as set-ups for upcoming plot twists (hmm, why did Cimorene pick up a pebble in the Caves of Fire and Darkness?). Wrede very successfully pokes fun at the fairy-tale tradition, only to get trapped in the less appealing cliches of modern fantasy when it comes time to build a plot of her own.<br />Still, more than a few episodes are both clever and funny (like the knights' continual efforts to save Cimorene from \\"captivity\\"). The young princess is a cohesive, effective heroine, while her friendship with the dragon Kazul develops along realistic paths. Two and a half nights of harmless fun. The sequel is already in my reading pile.	2002-04-01

It coddles the reader, croons reassuringly into his ear. Sturgeon has taken risks and written daring novels (\\"Venus Plus X\\", etc.), but this, his debut effort, is as old-fashioned as they come. This is the sort of novel in which the young hero saves the beautiful heroine from the clutches of the nefarious villain and inherits a fortune. <br />The first mental adjustment the reader must make is to realize that this is a story being told, not narrated. The impression of the author speaking through the book isn't as strong as in some of Heinlein's juveniles, but constant and unremitting. Sometimes Sturgeon injects bits of ad lib humor into the text(\\"Here she generated, on the spot, the most diffuse and colorful statement of her entire life\\"); unfortunately, at other times he manipulates and obscures certain story elements to create artificial suspense (a young child is passed for a midget; ten years pass with no one noticing; only much later do we learn that the child can change shape). Sturgeon also bleeps his own profanity, which is fairly amusing.<br />The characters are the greatest disappointment. Introduced as strong, memorable individuals, they gradually become cardboard scenery in the great cosmic conflict between Horty and the Maneater. The Maneater, the manic, scheming master of the freaks created with alien crystals, is perhaps the novel's only interesting character, though even at best a caricature. Horty Bluett, on the other hand, is just the sort of hero you want to stop reading about: a Superman clone who can change shape and size at will, has a perfect memory, and always acts a gentleman.<br />Despite moments of extreme Dickensian cheesyness and a string of unbelievable last-moment revelations, this two-hundred-page novel is a quick, pleasant read. \\"The DreamingJewels\\" is far and away one of the author's least successful novels, but its cohesive qualities show just why Sturgeon is a Grandmaster of the genre.	2002-03-20

Audley's total lack of skill shows frightening consistency. Four hundred pages and none of them worth reading. This is the first book in a very long time I have absolutely nothing good to say about.<br />Audley's prose is halting, cumbersome, infantile, full of run-ons, and deliberately pompous. Awkward words like \\"tiredness\\" keep popping up. The characters' actions are often illogical and entirely unmotivated, while their personalities change arbitrarily from chapter to chapter. Audley's worldbuilding efforts are laughable. If Aquasilva's global ocean is 11,000 miles deep, why do landmasses exist at all? What are \\"flamewood\\" and \\"seawood\\", besides cheap excuses not to invent real technology? The \\"mantas\\" have flown straight out of Star Trek, force-field defenses and all (\\"Increase shield strength as much as you can, and launch the pressure charges!\\") The politics of Audley's world are muddled and confusing. Half the countries mentioned aren't even on his map. Who conquered what and when are questions that long for real answers. When a king is assassinated, not only would I have been hard-pressed to identify what exactly he ruled, but that he existed at all. It is also unclear why Aquasilva's organised religion is so totally corrupt. Audley's bad guys aren't even bad as individuals; his Domain is a facelessly nefarious force of such absolute, uneffable evil that it must be hated wholeheartedly and without explanation.<br />As for the device of first-person narration - wishful thinking. In a certain scene a young woman rather spontaneously teaches the viewpoint hero \\"the arts of the night\\", which he finds rather pleasant. The young woman is never again mentioned. Cathan does however, have three other love interests, so that he can swtich between them as situation dictates. Throughout the book it is also revealed that he is a brilliant strategist, a superb swordsman, and the most powerful mage on the planet.<br />The bottom line is thatAudley just doesn't know enough - as a writer as well as a person - to tackle a project of such scale. He cobbles together a semblance of a plot, and then barely manages to keep it from disintegrating. He tries to prove his worth as a storyteller through scrupulous attention to minor detail, which is not only distracting and irritating to the reader, but also exposes Audley's weaknesses, forcing him to demonstrate non-existent technical knowledge. A better writer would have done research...  Because of this there are scenes of staggering, jaw-dropping idiocy, such as when Cathan conjures up and is washed away and covered \\"up to the neck\\" by a ton - one cubic meter - of water.<br />I would like to say that the author might improve with future novels, but I doubt he will. Audley shows no particular affinity for fantasy; he is looking for easy victories and takes too many shortcuts to generate anything worth reading. His debut is easily the worst book I've read all year.	2002-03-04

It has bright ideas and not-so-bright ideas, some of which he develops more than others, a shambles of a plot filled to the brim with clever scenes and memorable characters, and a nice cheeky attitude of a gumshoe novel transported into a warped, Philip K. Dickian future. Sometimes it keeps you glued to the page. Other times you feel like closing it and walking away.<br />First and foremost, \\"Gun, With Occasional Music\\" is a highly introverted novel. Lethem toys with a mannered, satirical tone that is sometimes irritating but can generate a chuckle now and then (\\"the dentist swiveled on his heels and disappeared, leaving me there to massage my jaw back into feeling after its brief, masochistic marriage to the top of my wooden desk\\"). Like Dick, he tosses around a lot of concepts no one takes seriously at first, but gradually become familiar: his big city is populated in part by \\"evolved\\" animals (\\"she was wearing a bonnet and a flowered dress, but she still smelled like the barnyard\\") and \\"babyheads\\", pre-aged children (\\"in a babybar, the drinking started early\\"). In fact, echoes of Dick show up in every part of the novel, from the underlying themes of coming to terms with reality and ambivalent ethics. Lethem even begins by waking his character with a rather bizarre contraption, much like Dick in his \\"Do Androids Dream...?\\" (Deckard is woken up by his mood organ, while Metcalf wakes up to the musical interpretation of the news), and drugs figure prominently in both authors' books (\\"Acceptol with just a touch of Regrettol\\").<br />The greatest problem is that all this inherited potential is trapped inside a do-not-resuscitate post-structuralist plot told from the POV of a character that has charisma, but is not taken advantage of. Lethem's hero is technically investigating a murder in his own time (his unique sense of duty won't let him quit), but if Conrad Metcalf is \\"playing it too existentially\\", so is Lethem: left withouta clue, his hero wanders from place to place, tries to wheedle information from people (sometimes very ominous and powerful people, whom he has no apparent reason to visit), precipitates trouble on himself, and the cycle starts over. The pacing suffers, and the tension slumps when it becomes apparent that Metcalf will keep up his valiant and foolhardy efforts despite his lack of success. For a great length of time it seems that the plot leads nowhere. The novel is saddled with scenes of sophomoric foul language, gruesome violence, and rather meaningless sex.<br />Lethem revives his novel in an unexpected second act that seems as if it was written separately. This isn't the sort of book to have a \\"Part 2\\", and Lethem shows great skill in his use of this rather exotic device. \\"Gun, With Occasional Music\\" ends with a powerfully written, poignant sequence of scenes that not only resolves every technical detail of the mystery, but also manages to prevent the reader from feeling cheated.<br />Unimpressive, with moments of occasional genius.	2002-02-25

Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane live in a countryside mansion replete with servants, they take trips to toy stores where they can buy whatever their hearts desire (the author informs us that this is the way children ought to be brought up), and inside a gravel-pit they have found a prehistoric sand-fairy that grants them wishes, one each day, but all their wishes have been turning out rotten so far. Well, boo hoo.<br />It isn't the concept that bothers me; it is the execution. Baum's and Carroll's heroines face comparable situations, but neither authors' books evoked such negative reactions from me. The reasons why the children's wishes fail I found especially abominable: when peerless beauty is wished for, the maid won't let them in since they look like \\"eyetalian monkeys\\"; when wealth is asked for and antique guineas appear by the bushel, the kids are arrested for thieves; when stolen jewellery magically reappears, it is Beale, the gameskeeper, who is immediately and incontrovertibly the chief suspect; when the four wish (accidentally) for the baby to grow up, the Lamb (Or Devereuz, or Hilary, or St Maur, as he should be rightly called) becomes a snappish fop. Nesbit draws miscellaneous moralistic lessons from her tale (\\"I cannot pretend that stealing is right\\"), but what use are these lessons when you are arrested whether or not you tell the truth? I would much rather Nesbit turn a cynical eye on the people she is describing, instead of using her keen powers of observations to weave an antithetical yarn.<br />At least her prose is reasonable enough. Nesbit's language is lucid, and while her sentence structure is rather sophisticated, it is not unduly so. Sadly, the same cannot be said of her characters. The four children who are the novel's protagonists are essentiallythe only developed characters, and while they are developed rather well, with plausibility and realism, they are bland. They are honest, noble, polite, friendly, sociable, and well-off; they treat the servants and people of lower station as functionaries, tools, ways of getting from A to B, and so does the author. Thus, there is little desire on the reader's part to come to know them better. They allow little conflict, little empathy. I'm probably the first to levy the charge that they have little wit and, if not for the fact that the wishes disappear at sundown, they would have great difficulty dealing with ther wishes.<br />But more about those wishes: it is quite surprising how many of them are accidental. In fact, there is little premeditated wishing going on past chapter six: otherwise, Nesbit would have been hard-pressed to find a reason for the children to wish for marauding Indians. What lesson are we, as readers, to draw from this? \\"Word your wishes carefully?\\" I'm reminded of the movie \\"Big,\\" in where a twelve-year-old wishes to be grown-up to impress an older girl, and instead becomes Tom Hanks and scares the heck out of everybody. Just once I'd like a book where the characters get their hearts' true desires and have to come to terms with THAT.	2002-01-30

Trim 300 pages in the beginning and another five at the end, and you would have a jarring, glorious novella residing somewhere between &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, and &quot;Darwin's Radio&quot;, a fantastic, harrowing look at a world gone mad as millions of years of ancestral memories boil over and wash civilization away, while mankind itself is caught in the Shiva's Dance of a thousand universes being continually reborn from the singularity that links spirit, matter, and energy - Nirvana. At 448 pages, Hendrix's novel is a lethargic read.<br />Those abominable three hundred pages ruin the book. For starters, they are taken straight out of Tad Williams' &quot;Otherland&quot; quartet: there's a journey by river through dangerous lands, and a problem with sleeping people, and the South African Republic is used as the scene of action in several chapters, and Leira Losaba is a carbon copy of Calliope Skouros, and a powerful individual is pulling strings from atop a gigantic skyscraper (Jongleur's Tower, anyone?), and one of his allies is an inscrutable Asian mastermind, and... and... it is meaningless to continue.<br />There's no sense of exoticism. Hendrix almost intentionally makes every character and event appear ordinary. His tone is casual, without wit or fancy. There's no desire to continue reading, because we've read all of it already, or at least it seems so. The characters are particularly inane and lack personality: they are all knowledgeable, curious, calm types that can be easily sorted into Lecturers (Fornash, Tomoko, Cameron) and Listeners (Trillia, Ricardo, John). They hold prolonged, mundane conversations that a better writer would mention only in passing, if at all.<br />Of course, it can be argued that the appeal of &quot;hard SF&quot; lies in the science. Perhaps. In other books. Although it is possible to understand most of the microbiology, the rest (paralleluniverse processing, which Hendrix reveals in the intro to be his own invention) is so completely tangled, absurd, and off the wall, that I failed to understand most of what was being said in any but the most rudimentary manner, and couldn't for a second believe even that. Perhaps this is because Hendrix does not sufficiently integrate his science into the story; most of it remains in lecture form, instead of manifesting itself practically (we are told of a &quot;shamanic complex&quot; for ages until we actually see it happening).<br />The first things to fall by the wayside are the language and the atmosphere. Hendrix's language, initially grizzled and masculine, quickly hits the literary equivalent of a brick wall and then sputters on feebly, mucking about from technicality to technicality, only to occasionally explode into completely inappropriate floweriness (&quot;the New York City hardscape spread fungally away, over the flat world trapped between sea and sky&quot;). The atmosphere is equally mismatched: the book tells of almost total ruination and desolation, yet maintains a paradisiac tone throughout. The Wer bands live in plenitude and don't seem to suffer from diseases, and the downfall of the human race seems to have made the nuked cities into giant gardens.<br />The last few chapters, which provide a direct account of the global madness running in parallel with our adventures reaching the end of their journey (the story inhabits two time periods - After and During the plague, both written in present tense), are the best in the book, though the unnecessarily uplifting and long-winded ending is an impasse at best.<br />There are better books out there.	2002-01-16

The similarities with the Addams Family are a great hidrance (the movies were better). Not nearly enough space is devoted to the family's supernatural aspect. The characters are inadequately described: instead of being &quot;outre and rococo&quot; they seem rather provincial. They make vague symbols; the allegory doesn't hold. The &quot;collapse from within&quot; subplot results in nothing more than a snicker of disbelief: the traitor has only been introduced a few pages ago and is never again mentioned. The storytelling format would've improved the book greatly if used throughout (instead of just the first eight chapters): perhaps from an adult Timothy's point of view? A Thousand Times Great Grandmere (a vaguely conscious mummy) is easily the most interesting character: the book begins and ends with her, both high notes. Social commentary is meager. The limp, dilute imagery rarely edges into the grotesque (reading about drafty chimneys only makes one more wistful for the derelict jewelbox cities of Mars). Musings on the rules and meaning of life and death are intriguing, but, again, too scant (&quot;Make Haste to Live&quot; is excellent, though).<br />An off-beat, mildly touching, somewhat entertaining anthology/novel. Easily a below-average book for Bradbury.	2001-12-26

I did not know what to expect from &quot;The King of Elfland's Daughter&quot;, and I still don't have anything concrete to say about its merits. It certainly does not rival Tolkien, and it certainly does not rival Dunsany's other novel, &quot;The Charwoman's Shadow&quot;, or his short stories (&quot;The Sword of Welleran&quot; is a must). Where in the above-mentioned works Dunsany is a master plowman tilling the soil of &quot;enchauntment&quot; and &quot;phantasy&quot;, in &quot;The King of Elfland's Daughter&quot; he is the horse pulling the plow. He borrows so much from the form he becomes its slave, right up until the fabulous ending. <br />The characters behave woodenly, without realism. When Alveric invades Elfland with his enchanted sword and slays the King of Elfland's guard, Lirazel, the title character, simply gazes at him &quot;in awe and wonder and love.&quot; There is a certain line past which a book might as well be called &quot;Amadis of Gaul&quot;, and TKOED is pushing that limit.<br />The language... I found it complicated, though not always graceful. Dunsany uses flowery synomims with a great deal of zeal: thunderbolts quickly become &quot;strangers to the Earth&quot;, then &quot;cousins of Earth that visited us from their etherial home&quot;. Similarly, on the use of &quot;the fields we know&quot; and &quot;only song may tell&quot;: poetic phrases - too bad Dunsany feels compelled to use them several times on every page.<br />Certainly there are moments when the words flow together, and, with time, sentences like &quot;now the Vale of Earl is very near to the border beyond which there is none of the fields we know(10)&quot; do let off, to be replaced by powerful, graceful prose along the lines of &quot;...and the elfin morning brightened over leagues of Elfland with the old lf Kings joy [101].&quot; Powerful scenes appear more consistently as the plot thickens (the Freer's and Ziroondel's soliloquies come to mind). The characters gain, if not realism, then dramatic tension. There is a slaying of a unicorn quite as grisly as the one in White's classic, and I believe that Tolkien's fox from early on in &quot;Fellowship&quot; is a direct descendant of Dunsany's creature, &quot;fabulous but only in Elfland, as unicorns are here (128).&quot;<br />There are certain devices that do not agree with me, most notable of which are the occasional paragraphs written in the first person from the view of an omniscient storyteller. I find these break the book's spell. The device of the storyteller also leads to several glaring anachronisms (thermite is mentioned in one scene, as is Tennyson). <br />There are several passages I enjoyed immensely. One can say I liked the book as a tragedy rather than a fantasy. The chapter about the ebbing of elfland is spectacular, as is &quot;The Reticence of the Leather Worker&quot;, and Lurulu's musings about the nature of time (the troll by itsself is quite a character). The limited use of the &quot;band of unlikely heroes&quot; motif is excellent (and why not? the book was written before it became a cliche): instead of a pack of adventurers seeking treasure, Dunsany's band consists of &quot;a young shepherd well-used to lonely spaces&quot;, &quot;a lad that was crosse in love&quot;, &quot;one that had heard a curious song&quot;, a simple boy, a moonstruck youth, and an aggrieved tragic hero in search of something he cannot regain. The subplot works wonders, even though I was a bit dubious about Alveric traveling north for eleven years and still ending up at the witch's hut just in time.<br />About Neil Gaiman's comparison: yes, TKOED is fine wine compared to the diluted cola of much of what is published today, but as a classic it is a minor and rather obscure one.	2001-12-19
US	50899460	R2XEBV0NV1KOKK	0312855451	376319675	The Last Hot Time	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Moments of sheer brilliance... and of utter confusion.	&quot;The Last Hot Time&quot; is a resonably excellent book, but I have severe reservations about recommending it outright. The book has a fantastic premise, a large number of unusual, if slightly flat characters, great ambiance,  and the power to absorb the reader utterly. On the other hand, there are stretches of dull non-events and moments of such absolute confusion that the reader begins to wonder about the rhetorical &quot;why?&quot;.<br />&quot; 'You'll regret it,' he looked up smiling. 'This isn't a threat. I won't _make_ you regret it.' &quot; This was the line that told me that, at last, I was reading something worthwhile. Something that transcends cliches. Something that is humane and believable. Ford's writing is fresh and clean - any faults are its own, not inherent to the age-old cliche. As in many other books, the young hero isn't an especially good dancer - but where else have you NOT read long scenes of the hero's agonizing embarassment at that fact?<br />However, I have to agree with the reviewer m-fitz about the fact that the various parts of the book just don't seem to add up. The Levee, tribal and elfin magic, Vamps, Loop Garous, Shadow Cabinet secret police and the Shadow itself are intensely interesting ideas, but Ford barely elaborates on them. The book is mum about its most fascinating aspects just when we want to know more.<br />&quot;The Last Hot Time&quot; has moments of almost magic realism. While reading about Danny's quarters in Patrise's mansion, I could actually relax in my hard, rigid reading chair. The reader is IMMERSED into the words.<br />Unfortunately, there are many, many moments where the author loses the reader. The characters are too many, and introduced too quickly, to be remembered as individuals. Even at the end I was having difficulty telling Shaker and Alvah apart. After page fifty or so the book begins losing steam - the scenes at La Mirada and at Patrise's mansion are so similar they seem to be re-writes of each other, and so frequent that those two locations seem to be the only ones in the book (however interesting locations they may be). There are many scenes in which the characters half-guess what the other is going to say - but the reader doesn't. Anyone who can understand a single &quot;Contrarian Flow&quot; column will receive a big thanks from me. Lastly, the characters seem almost too mellow at times (while Danny is performing an autopsy, Stagger Lee brings him a mug of coffee - but what coffee it is!). <br />Ford is very whimsical in assembling the setting: we have mentions of &quot;wire-wheeled cars&quot; alongside &quot;electric folk&quot; music and &quot;spaceship controls.&quot; Roaring-twenties fantasy-punk is an excellent sub-genre, and I hope more authors take advantage of it. Ford has done an amazing amount of research, and the book is peppered with information that rings true - history, medical trivia, fine art, etc.<br />This is one of those books I hope more people read - it has such promise I want someone to fall in love with it. &quot;The Last Hot Time&quot; is original, intense, and complex, and warrants an immediate re-read - something I wasn't too enthusiastic about.	2001-12-01
US	50899460	RIREB1UXGZ9CG	1890117080	644427230	Implements of Destruction	Books	2	8	15	N	N	A second star for effort.	To give you an understanding of the general level of sophistication in &quot;Implements of Destruction,&quot; contemplate the following scene: a master swordswoman seeks to enter a militant stronghold - and to disguise herself she rubs mud on her face; apparently, a simple facial is enough to conceal leanness and gracility of figure, any elegance of motion, and even your steed. In a better book, this would be the doing of a comic sidekick - in &quot;Implements,&quot; Theala is the hero.<br />Calligaro doesn't simply write to the formula - he's happy to. He writes in Ye Olde Pulkspeake (it's easy to recognize because the word for &quot;look&quot; is always &quot;gaze&quot; and the word for &quot;clothing&quot; is always &quot;garments&quot;), and the plot is a collection of every fantasy generality ever though of: forget &quot;The Tough Guide to Fantasyland&quot; - here is the real deal! <br />Calligaro's descriptions are vague and meandering. It is clear that no resarch went into the writing: I laughed during the scene in which the heroes catch, roast, and eat a mountain lion (p.130); the author even has trouble describing medieval cities (if half of Taloria were shadowed by a rocky overhang, wouldn't it be in perpetual twilight?) and mountainous terrain (try and follow his reasoning in the waterfall scene). Words are overused as Calligaro gropes for synonims (a short paragraph on page 54 uses the word &quot;wrist&quot; five times). Moments of extreme awkwardness emerge during unnecessary viewpoint switches. The fight scenes are confusing and overwritten - the material seems to reside at the video-game level, if even that.<br />The story develops... excuse me for a second while I laugh uncontrollably at having written the words &quot;the story develops.&quot; The story does not develop. It sprang fully formed from the realm of Lowest Common Denominator Fantasy. In a groundbreaking twist, the story does not start at an Inn. It starts on a Traditional Hilltop with theHeroine overlooking a Warrior Camp. The Inn is the second scene. Three characters are introduced: Theala, the above-mentioned incarnation of swordfighting genius (or vanity, or tragedy, or comedy, or whatever the plot requires); Smithe, a good-for-nothing bandit with a heart of gold who speaks in thief cant (all his verbs are in third person); and, lastly, Bytor, a daemon warrior who is very obviously Theala's long-lost brother. Like so many other moody co-heroes, he's just recently emerged from hell and isn't quite comfortable with the concept of being human.<br />Having introduced these three characters, whom we are destined to follow for two-hundred-odd pages (or fewer; if you're lucky, none at all), the book runs out of steam. We get a scene of wraithlike &quot;Implementors&quot; destroying a village, for no reason other than to let Calligaro include an Ominous Foreshadowing Scene. Meanwhile, the heroes take a shopping trip to Taloria, the capital of whatever (the book does not deign to inform us whether its world is subdivided in any way). In Taloria, Calligaro cunningly introduces a quest (&quot;If that is so, then we have a destination for our travels [86]&quot;), and the heroes depart - but not before Taloria is destroyed by Implementors, giving Calligaro an excuse to insert a scene of Urban Panic.<br />The heroes travel through mountains, where they meet a Gollum stand-in (a ssssslithery, sssssibilant creature named Rranssorr) and find some Dwarves and their Underground City (but not before risking their very lives in several yawn-inducing encounters with Implementors). Having awed us sufficiently, Calligaro lets the heroes reach their goal, with so little payoff that he immendiately forces the heroes to on an Afterquest, though not before revealing the Implementors' arbitrary nature in a scene so overwrought it's funny.<br />So, why two stars, you ask. Because the image of an amateur writer typing away feverishly is very endearing to me, a hopeful writermyself. To give &quot;Implements&quot; one star would be a crime. Calligaro will never be a great writer, not even a particularly entertaining one, but he is a writer - and that's an aspiration so many of us have. <br />Oh, and the exploding Rubik's Cube.	2001-11-24
US	50899460	R1K1J9FM5LM6SD	0312867522	953091978	Rhapsody: Child of Blood	Books	2	104	166	N	N	&quot;Rhapsody&quot; gets a bad rap - with good reason	Why was this book written? What purpose stands behind it? A work of fiction is an interplay of ideas - &quot;Rhapsody&quot; is more like a collision of cliches, with lots of interesting yet lifeless tidbits interspersed with some of the most insipid writing ever committed to paper. There are snatches that read like Salvatore, parts reminiscent of Weis and Hickman, more than a few bits of Goodkind here and there (I imagine fans of one will be fans of the other), but the book never quite connects then dots - it occupies the uneasy vacuum between a character story, an adventure story, and a setting story.<br />&quot;Rhapsody&quot; is a rote exercise in fantasy, limp and without passion. So limp and so without passion that the reader is reduced to analyzing what went wrong with any given scene, the way the characters are described, or how the dialog flows (or, in this instance, doesn't). Thus, I found it interesting when, as Rhapsody is being abducted for no reason (oh, the book provides one, but it is almost impossibly contrived), she turns around to gaze at the cityscape. We see the stone houses, the jumble of marble temples... of course, you have to understand there isn't a single original word in there - I can quote identical lines from Howard, if not Dunsany. My interest wanes, only to revive several pages later at the mention of &quot;some root that also needed cooking (66).&quot; What is this mysterious root, that lone vegetable ingredient of &quot;stew,&quot; the fantasy catch-all dish? Then comes a scene with a wrathful demon-priest. It's unintentionally funny, because too many things catch on fire. The book opens with two adolescents meeting. They instantly feel they are meant for each other and have sex - in the course of a long, protracted, very descriptive scene. Several things wrong here: a - this is child pornography; b - no fourteen-year-olds could possibly pull off anything close to what is described; and c - this is actually the setup for the sequel, never to be tackled till the very end of the book, when we've lost all interest.<br />The book continues on in this fashion, alternating between the sing-song language of badly written fantasy and parts possessing a tone so oblique and impenetrable that it seems Haydon wrote the book against her will (the interminable scene with the Root comes to mind). The characters aren't much help: these two-trait manikins are bereft of any semblance of humanity; they are plot devices, despite even the fact that only three are developed to any useful extent. Haydon doesn't understand that there are ways to elaborate characters other than long, winding conversations.<br />Haydon tells, not shows, far more than is necessary, and when she IS able to communicate something through her characters' actions, not only does the whole situation seem contrived, but Haydon repeats the scene again and again to hammer in the point (the numerous scenes of people getting weak-kneed at the sight of Rhapsody's face come to mind). She also cannot do without the simplistic device of switching viewpoints when a character needs introducing: she simply inserts a small scene written from the new character's viewpoint, and later everyone knows how to respond. Lastly, her writing is exceptionally florid. &quot;He was perennially in a state of vigilance (349)&quot; could be much more comfortably phrased as &quot;he was always cautious.&quot;<br />In addition, Haydon is uncertain about this odd device of &quot;plot&quot;. At first she abandons it almost totally. Then, when her characters emerge from the Root two hundred pages and fourteen hundred years later, she tries to build one - for no reason at all. Achmed, one of Rhapsody's two companions, develops a sudden interst in becoming the King of the Bolg tribes. He has no motivation to rule a nation of cliche savages, but who cares. Rhapsody, who is normally queasy at the sight of blood, starts enjoying the numerous flashy swordfight scenes, for no reason other than to let them exist (at first she is almost in hysterics, but later dismisses gruesome skirmishes as &quot;unholy messes&quot;). Then she sanctions the brutal conquest of the Bolg. The victory is very simple, because Haydon fails to communicate the costs involved. Even when the characters occupy Gwydion's ruined palace, they seem to be on vacation. Haydon realizes that her book is failing and tacks on a comic sidekick - Jo, a street urchin. Lots of scenes follow in which Jo mistakes men's privates for coin purses (the book is generally heavy on innuendo no one could find funny, or at least not repeatedly).<br />Magic plays an unbelievably small role: the F'Dor (the demon-priest who sets things on fire) is abandoned early in the book; Rhapsody can put things to sleep through music, but her arcane gifts are just conversation pieces (&quot;you're a Namer, eh?&quot;)... oh, wait, scratch that - she uses her gifts in two totally extraneous scenes: in one she charms an Ouroboros look-alike and in another revives a tree (note that both times she leaves her harp behind her, only to be seen playing it in the next scene). In essence, the entire book boils down to an incredibly lengthy prologue form its sequel: we never discover what malicious magic hypnotizes the villagers and abducts children (there's a scene where waves of zombie villagers assault a friendly duke's mansion, yet further in the book Lord Stephen acts as if nothing happened); who is Rakshi, and who is pulling his strings? is Llauron really Gwydion's son, and why does it matter? So many loose ends remain untied, it's scary.<br />Even at its best, &quot;Rhapsody&quot; fails to absorb. There isn't even a climax, or a resolution: this isn't even a part of a trilogy as much as a complex setup for the sequel. And I can sincerely say I am not at all likely to read the next book in the series - it may well turn out to be the prequel for the third.	2001-11-14

In the three &quot;next-generation&quot; Earthsea books, LeGuin has completely re-interpreted the basic tenets of the world of Earthsea. &quot;Tehanu,&quot; &quot;Tales from Earthsea,&quot; and &quot;The Other Wind&quot; cannot, must not be read as sequels to &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea,&quot; &quot;Tombs of Atuan,&quot; and &quot;The Farthest Shore.&quot; For all intents and purposes, we might as well be reading about two separate Earthseas.<br />Having said that, I cannot but compare &quot;The Other Wind&quot; to &quot;The Farthest Shore.&quot; In &quot;The Farthest Shore,&quot; corrupt Pelnish wizard Cob has broken the barrier between life and death in a bid for immortality. &quot;The Other Wind&quot; begins in a similar vein: in his dreams, Alder, a village sorceror, has visions of his beloved wife calling out to him from beyond the wall of stones that separates the land of the living from the Dry Land. The lovers even kiss across the wall, leaving Alder frost-bitten. In his continuing visions, masses of the dead cry out to him, &quot;Free us!&quot;<br />Now, a book about Cob would be great, probably because he was so inadequately explained in &quot;The Farthest Shore.&quot; And at first it appears that &quot;The Other Wind&quot; is indeed about Cob (hasn't LeGuin toyed with Tenar's name in &quot;Tehanu&quot;?). It is not. Alder seeks help from the wizards of Roke, but he cannot enter the Great House with his hideous burden. Master Patterner directs Alder to seek out Ged, the aging Archmage emeritus, but Ged, who has spent all his sorcery to heal the wound of the world in &quot;The Farthest Shore,&quot; is also at a loss (the words he spoke while on Kalessin's back were probably wishful thinking). Sparrowhawk sends Alder to seek the audience of King Lebannen in Havnor, where Tenar and Tehanu are also visiting.<br />As you can see, there is a lot of empty travel in &quot;The Other Wind.&quot; Very little actually happens until the last chapter. This isn't necessarily bad, because LeGuin can work miracles with character development, but this also isn't the case. The author probably intends the reader to rely on his foreknowledge of the characters, because the familiar characters - Lebannen, Tenar, Ged - are identified sketchily at best. They have few qualities that make them unique. This sincerely disappointed me, because static characters aren't usually a LeGuin trademark.<br />However, &quot;The Other Wind&quot; has two redeeming parts: the sub-plot involving Seserakh, the Kargish princess sent to marry the King, is simply brilliant; LeGuin has shown that she can refine her stance on gender issues and weave a convincing parable about interpersonal relationships; secondly, the novel's resolution leaves nothing to be desired - it is quite frankly flawless. LeGuin offers us an explanation that is startlingly poetic and original, while also consistent with the earlier books. I cannot say much more, except that the grand finale also clarifies &quot;Tehanu&quot;'s disappointing ending, and gives a degree of finality to the Earthsea series in general.<br />While not quite as captivating as the first Earthsea trilogy, the second triptych has given us a more personal glimpse into the workings of a fantasy world.

US	50899460	R2CMQRRI0NMMCA	0380974797	395065543	Six Moon Dance	Books	3	4	7	N	N	Should've been half as long. Or even shorter.	This is the first Tepper book I've had the courage to finish. It's taken me two and a half weeks, three times longer than usual for a book this size. I'm not happy. Tepper has obviously mastered the gift of slow-motion storytelling. Vaguely developed characters drift in and out of the warm sludge of backstory only to announce that they are still there and may actually serve some purpose. Which they do: at the very end of the book, literally everyone comes to attend the monumental showdown; until then, all of them are ballast. Ornery Bastable first appears in Chapter 2 ... and then in Chapter 18. The Questioner is first seen in Chapter 7 ... and then again in 31.<br />&quot;Six Moon Dance&quot; begins innocuously and even promisingly. Mouche, a young boy, is sold by his poor family to a Consort House, where he will be trained to become a lover and companion for jaded women. Women are generally more respected on Newholme (the scifantasy planet on which the largest part of the story take place), because there are so few of them: they bring dowries for their parents' families, they bear and bring up children, they maintain the hearth, and they thus claim &quot;compensatory joys&quot; for their toils. The Newholmian society is, in general, an interesting matter: it is realistically shaped by a shortage of women and a mysterious overabundance of manual labor. It is also maintained in a functional state by a gang of social engineers, who are also the head priestesses.<br />Of course, this isn't what the novel is about. &quot;Six Moon Dance&quot; is about apocalyptic behaviors of legendary interstellar beings. It is also about six moons and some sort of dance. It is almost certainly not about any part of Mouche's training, Madame Genevois' musings, the Hags, Men of Business, or any of the characters' massive backstories. The events of chapters 7 and 9 actually form the book's backbone, though the reader has to wait until chapter 49 for an explanation.<br />Therein lies the&quot;Six Moon Dance&quot;'s greatest weakness: it's the single most padded book ever written. The reader bores of even the most original aspects of the book because of all the filler. The Newholmian social structure, designed to reduce frictions to a minimum, would make an excellent subject for a book. Here it gets absolutely lost in the two hundred and fifty pages where nothing happens.<br />The real plot does not come together until Chapter 36 or so. The book revives quite nicely at that point, building up tension with a staccato of revelations that seem brilliant only in light of all the previous non-events. A thrilling and melodramatic finale in which everyone acts out of character follows.<br />I completely agree with the necessity of providing a happy ending. A reader who has just made it through needs some time to recuperate.<br />It must indeed be a sing of the times that instead of reading about placating restless gods with exotic rituals, we get a book about placating giant interstellar moths with group sex.	2001-10-09
US	50899460	R3RTB4R52RJ9HE	0312867131	77230724	Calculating God	Books	2	28	46	N	N	Sawyer futilely hopes that unresolved issues just go away.	An alien spacecraft lands in front of the Royal Ontario Museum. Its eight-legged occupant enters the building and asks, in perfect English, to see a paleontologist. Why? Because every inhabited planet her expedition visited went through an identical cycle of extinctions. If Earth fits that pattern, the aliens' theories of God's existence will be proved. The fossil record matches up, but can Hollus, the all-too human spider creature from a distant star, convince the terminally-ill paleontologist, Tom Jericho, that the universe has a creator?<br />I got through the first quarter of &quot;Calculating God&quot; with extreme difficulty. Here was what seemed to be the very antithesis of every science fiction book ever written. An alien emissary comes down to Earth and reveals that the speed of light cannot be transcended, that there are neither hyperspace nor parallel dimensions, that there are only three intelligent races (including humans) within conquerable distance, and that there is a God. Whereas science fiction is the discovery of new possibilities, &quot;Calculating God&quot; is those possibilities' denial.<br />&quot;Calculating God&quot; is a very painful read, largely because Sawyer's excellent writing is trapped within a tired plot that does little but open up some old wounds. First and foremost, there is the communication problem between Tom and Hollus on God's nature. The alien presents an exceedingly strong case for the existance of a creative force, using scientific data that is only partly fictional. Tom disagrees, because if God exists, why does Tom have cancer? This is a clear communication error: for the two main characters, the word &quot;God&quot; means two entirely different things, but they don't seem to see this.<br />Secondly, why is Tom having these conversations with Hollus at all? Nothing he says - outside of his area of expertise - can possibly be new to the alien, and yet Jericho and Hollus engage in heated discussions, despite the fact thatHollus really should have the advantage of two centuries' worth of scientific progress. Is Hollus humoring Tom, or is the alien just plain stupid? And despite the fact that Tom can't possibly contribute to the Forhilnors' knowledge in any way, he &quot;mysteriously&quot; solves the enigmas of alien ruins scattered throughout the galaxy, the next stage of humanity's evolution, and, best of all, God's ultimate purpose for all intelligent life. <br />With time, the book does get better. Character development overtakes the heated metaphysical discussions, and Tom's suffering and decline acquires a measure of pathos: Sawyer reveals that Tom has a loving family - a dear wife and an adopted six-year-old son. Meanwhile, a sideplot develops. Apparently, a pair of fanatical gaptoothed southerners are bent on destroying the priceless Burgess shales to show the aliens that the people of Earth really believe in God. Worse yet, these cardboard creationists watch the Red Green show. Here even Sawyer's considerable talent fails.<br />Even Sawyer's science is a bit shaky. His store of factual evidence exhausted during an intense conversation with Hollus, the writer has to resort to virtual reality and anti-gravity belts. <br />Possibly, there is a message of tolerance and conviviality hidden somewhere in this book. Too bad it gets garbled by all the heavy subject matter Sawyer treats with such unfair simplicity.	2001-09-20
US	50899460	RPV569LE0CGQH	0380770237	302223171	Lord Demon	Books	2	15	21	N	N	Lindskold - a Zelazny clone? Nah, not likely...	Kai Wren, Lord Demon, enchanter and bottlemaker, is brought out of seclusion by the loss of a dear friend. Digging deeper, he discovers a devious plot of conquest he himself may not be able to thwart. One big problem - after centuries of hermitage, can he still tell which of his allies are faithful, and which are not?<br />Lindskold has nothing of Zelazny's subtlety and clarity of vision, and turning over the master's unfinished work to a mere apprentice leads to nothing short of disaster. I believe that Zelazny intended the demons' social structure in &quot;Lord Demon&quot; to reflect - to a degree - the social hierarchy of an immigrant minority. For example, while Kai Wren, in his human guise, manifests as a dignified, cultured gentleman, scrub demons - the lowest rung of the demon totem pole - are filthy, uncouth, and speak in broken English. This fairly potent theme, played over a wholesome adventure tale in the best Zelazny fashion, would doubtless make a heck of a book. Linskold denies us that. Instead of a riveting yarn steeped in oriental symbolism, the story she spins is so absurdly tangled that it's impossible to keep all of it straight, and yet so absolutely repetitive and mundane that there is really no point to continue reading. Her characters are devoid of any semblance of humanity, and she develops the plot by methods that seem extremely amateurish: the story can be easily laid out in schematic form; quite obviously, Lindskold drew an &quot;idea tree&quot; and then just expressed it in words. She strings together events hoping that quantity is quality, and peppers them with such tired plot devices as dinner-table strategy sessions. <br />Furthermore, &quot;Lord Demon&quot; bears an uncanny similarity to Zelazny's own &quot;Nine Princes in Amber.&quot; Lindskold even hazards a blunt allusion to the latter work (&quot;Didn't something like this happen in some book?..&quot;) Indeed, both novels follow a similar pattern: a powerful character is caught unaware, robbed of his powers and imprisoned in the human world, but on the strength of his own virtues he regains his rightful position. Fortunately for &quot;Nine Princes,&quot; it begins at &quot;Lord Demon's&quot; midpoint, whereas in &quot;Lord Demon&quot; the reader has to get over a very promising prelude that Lindskold quickly abandons. And whereas the fallen Amberite in Zelazny's classic reasserts his rights through his own qualities, Lindskold's Kai Wren depends on his friend's contrived magical abilities all the way to the finale.<br />Lindskold lacks Zelazny's subtle touch and his deep understanding of different cultures and personalities. Her characters never come off the page as anything other than stereotypes, and the oriental atmosphere the old master establishes is quickly reduced to quick-fire voleys of esoteric trivia. Lindskold takes minor characters Zelazny never intended to play cardinal roles, and creates &quot;a band of unlikely adventurers&quot; from them (another tired cliche). Essentially, she takes a story with a heart and soul and turns it into modern fantasy fluff. And modern fantasy fluff isn't something I care to read after Zelazny's highly intriguing fifty-page teaser. I'll read &quot;Donnerjack&quot; eventually, but I'm dreading to start it.	2001-09-12
US	50899460	R1V6DMJIKIVQ9F	0060958308	377218208	The Assistant (Perennial Classics)	Books	2	7	19	N	N	A tug of war of a book - a tragedy a minute.	Halfway through &quot;The Assistant&quot; I felt confident enough to make a prediction about its ending. The prediction turned out to be only partly correct, but that is beyond the point. That prediction is at all possible is a sure indication that the author failed to engage me as a reader. Once the prediction is made the book is trapped: if it comes true, then the book is predictable; if it doesn't, then one has the full right to complain about contrived plot twists.<br />Why did I feel confident enough to guess the ending? Because the story is painfully obvious. The story - and the outcome - are evident immediately after the first few pages. A struggling Jewish grocer is robbed, but one of the robbers has a conscience and clandestinely comes back to the store to work off the damage. We aren't told this in these exact words until page fifty or so, but it's obvious as soon as we see the character of Frank Alpine. Here is a character that is engaged in Deep Moral Struggle. Since this is a predictable book, all that is necessary to find out the remainder of the plot is to ask a few questions: Will Frank gather enough self-control to become a decent person (Y/N)? Will the store do better with him around (Y/N)? Will he fall in love with the grocer's daughter (Y/N)? And so on, and so forth. It was with a sinking heart that I guessed the beginnng and the ending, and then beheld the two hundred pages in between. What else could possibly happen? Read on.<br />In those two hundren-odd pages, the book turns into the absolutely sappiest melodrama ever written. To be sure, &quot;The Assistant&quot; lacks a main conflict. Yes, the store is a shambles; yes, these people have been slaving away for nothing; yes, they live in poverty; yes, they're Jews. Those themes almost never surface. Instead, Malamud fills space with the most contrived, cliche mini-conflicts imaginable. I'll leave it up to you to find out what they are, but each of those conflicts is written like it is the endof the world. Of course, it can't be, since there's still 2/3 of the book to go, but the characters gnash and lament like there's no tomorrow anyway. Malamud frantically stitches viewpoint characters, often three times in a single page, to illustrate their grief from all perspectives. Rule #1: the author can only cry &quot;wolf&quot; so many times before it loses punch. It took us four &quot;Scream&quot; movies to get this down. Of course, Malamud predates &quot;Scream&quot;. The book reminds me of a scene from a Simpsons Halloween special, where Homer purchases a birthday present from an occult curio store (shades of Matheson's short story &quot;Prey&quot;). The toy is evil. &quot;That's bad&quot;, Homer replies. But it comes with a free frozen yogurt! &quot;That's good!&quot; The yogurt is also evil. &quot;That's bad.&quot; But it comes with your choice of toppings! &quot;That's good!&quot; The toppings contain potassium benzoate. Homer stares stupidly. &quot;That's bad,&quot; the clerk helps him out.<br />The book wouldn't have been as bad if the characters were more solid. The grocer and his wife are stereotypes: Morris is gruff but forgiving, while Ida is the precursor of every strict Jewish mother that ever was. Frank, on the other hand, is a walking collection of human traits that are only loosely connected. He's street-smart and ruthless, both patient and impatient, a gentleman and an animal, frigid and lustful, caring and obscene, both with and without a conscience. He's so diffuse that the reader cannot identify with him.<br />&quot;The Assistant&quot; cannot choose one of its numerous running themes to center on. It tugs the reader this way and that. Characters fall in love, and break up, and fall in love again. Malamud throws so many things at the reader, that after a while the only effect of reading the book is a dull heartache.	2001-08-08
US	50899460	R3QSNZMXRFBHIK	0737703326	696705200	Contemporary Issues Companion - School Violence (Hardcover Edition)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Debunking the myth- the ugly and the very ugly about school	&quot;School Violence&quot; turned out to be a pleasant surprise in that it avoids the usual &quot;quick-fix&quot; proposition: waging total war on commercial entertainment. Instead it takes a more personal and immediate approach, focussing on the actual conditions at the schools, interviewing the survivors, examining the shooters as individuals, and proposing direct measures to curb the violent behaviors. In doing so, the articles also paint an amazingly dark picture of the American schools: violent, rotten places where the kids are poorly supervised, where the teachers are indolent and vengeful, and where no one does anything to stop even the mot injurious forms of bullying. Some of thes first-hand accounts are so grim as to be unbelievable (Dixon, &quot;Six Years of Horror&quot;). On the other hand, the book sometimes edges into saccharine melodrama familiar from syndicated TV hungry for happy endings: &quot;We are Columbine&quot; - &quot;We will always be Columbine!&quot; - &quot;Columbine forever.&quot;<br />The organization is strong and intuitive. The book is subdivided into four sections: trends and tendencies, causes, first-hand accounts, and possible solutions. The first section isn't particularly informative, failing to draw any but the vaguest of answers, failing to portray the scope of the problem in any meaningful way, or just tossing around some tired accusations (the ubiqitous Mr. Males sneaked into this volume as well, and his arguments are particularly caustic). &quot;Causes&quot;, the second section, is where I expected the book to fall on its face. Fortunately, &quot;School Violence&quot; unites all sermons on the evils of pop culture into a single unconvincing harangue (&quot;For most kids, however, the popular culture is acting as a coarsener, a desensitizer, and a dehumanizer... (60)&quot;). The remainder of the arguments include some that are not often heard, such as the possible link between psychiatric drugs and school violence and the loopholes in the individuals-with-disabilities laws. Best of all, the book does not treat the perpetrator of violent acts as degranged monsters - fittingly, &quot;School Violence&quot; addresses all forms of school violence, treating them as the culmination of the abusive social climate at schools.<br />The third section came as a surprise: these first-hand accounts are hard to find. The ones in this book are particularly revealing, debunking the majority of media myths about Harris and Klebold (the Columbine shooters).<br />However, the measures proposed in the fourth section seem drastic and counterproductive in comparison to the ealier arguments: increased penalties and involving the criminal justice system at schools (to get troubled students out of the system ASAP), increased monitoring, screening, and pat-searching, even arming the teachers(!?). There are a few &quot;nice&quot; articles, but they get lost.<br />Of course, the book isn't without flaws. I suspect it of playing on my interests and preconceptions more than once. Frequently I cringed at toxic logic along the lines of &quot;there are so few boundaries for kids these days, with the drug use and violence, so if we give them some limits, that's good (126)&quot;. To quote another rotten apple: &quot;We thought about letting our child make this decision, but decided it was unfair to turn the problem over to him (108).&quot; Here's  particular passage the made my blood rush to my face:<br />&quot;If it's the assassination of a president, the bombing of a federal building, or the mass murder of high-school students by wigged-out teenagers full of pubescent resentment, plugged-up hormones, and the mental and moral garbage regularly served them by their schools, their televisions, their movies, their music, their books, their government and their newspapers, then it has to be because &quot;the right&quot; is on the move... these young men [Harris and Klebold] grew up in the make-believe world concocted by liberalism, a fantastic place where race and sex mean nothing; where violence and crime don't exist and guns have no function and no meaning, even as toys;... where people who adhere to &quot;RACISM!&quot; deserve to have their arms torn off and be burned, and... healthy young men whose genes and glands and brains drive them to aggression, are simply blank slated to be shaped, twisted, and scribbled over by &quot;anger management&quot; programs...(82-84)&quot; <br />I'm still at a loss to deduce what that contributor's agrument actually is. Fortunately, the useful portions far outnumber such garbage.	2001-07-30
US	50899460	R1ZPT5YZYJ9A9T	038549081X	709722953	The Handmaid's Tale	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Tasteful ruminations	The Gileadian Takeover happened very quickly, and before anyone had a chance to react, martial law was announced, women were robbed of their jobs, and all marriages after the first were declared unlawful. To halt the dropping Caucasian birth rate, unattached able-bodied women were corraled into &quot;Red Centers&quot;, where meekness and submissiveness were hammered into them under prison-like conditions. Later, these &quot;handmaids&quot; were redistributed to affluent households, childbearing being their only goal in life. This is the tale of one of these unfortunates: 33-year-old &quot;Offred&quot; can still remember her husband and daughter, being allowed to read and write, but with every passing year this Calvinist society claims more and more of her.<br />Very surprisingly, &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; did not at all strike me as especially feministic. Its dystopia is all the more striking because everyone is discomfited - both the opressor and the opressed. Out of the numerous cautionary tales I've read this is the rare one that takes into account almost every side of the story: whereas others usually pose one side as unjust tyrants and have the other side engage in a just struggle, the quietly nightmarish world of &quot;Handmaid's Tale&quot; is especially appealing in that its central character, a nameless everywoman knows only by a patronimical (Offred - &quot;Of-Fred&quot;), is out not to revolutionize, but to survive. Indeed, this is a tale of finding contentment in the unlikeliest of places, of living day to day, of forming relationships, of adapting, and of coping. Not wasting any more time than necessary on the do-not-resuscitate plot (Offred's eventual escape), Atwood commits every last drop of her writing prowess to examine the personalities of her characters and the numbing effects of the new order. In doing so, in constantly examining and re-examining Offred from every perspective, she makes her so multi-faceted as to make her more than a character - she becomes an excellent interface between the reader and Atwood's conceptual vehicle.<br />The profoundly disturbing - of not particularly likely to happen - dystopia Atwood creates serves as a stage for examining the various drives and motivations of her characters, using the veil of strangeness to abstract her findings into something approaching objectiveness.<br />Something I didn't expect was how particularly inert men are in the world of the &quot;Handmaid&quot;. While the narrator speaks no more cynically of them than of the women, it is women who seem to run everything, from the general social order to the secret underground. Men appear content - if not especially happy - with their secret burlesques and generally acting as if they still had any real power.<br />While I enjoyed the gentle manner with which the author maintained my attention despite the poststructuralist approach, there are few memorable ideas that the book communicates. I feel that I will remember it solely for the ludicrous, gruesome visual trappings - and that's quite a misfortune.	2001-07-27
US	50899460	R50T4PN2HQDWF	1565048369	834805589	Bending the Landscape: Fantasy	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Mind-bending fantasy	Because of its diverse bouquet of erotic undercurrents, BTL: Fantasy is especially adept with wry, bittersweet fantasies - not the swords-and-sorcery type, but touching tales with a modern-supernatural slant. There are all sorts of uplifting motifs here - getting over midlife crises (Antieau's &quot;Desire&quot;), revisiting childhood places ( Thrower's &quot;The Home Town Boy&quot;), dealing with the deaths of friends (Shepherd's &quot;Gary, in the Shadows&quot;) and loved ones (Silverthrorne's &quot;The Sound of Angels&quot;), release and spiritual freedom (What's &quot;Beside the Well&quot;), turning back the clock on painful memories (Verona's &quot;Mahu&quot;), and so on. <br />As far as the subgenres represented in this volume, you'll find very few traditional hack-and-slash stories (&quot;The Stars Are Tears,&quot; &quot;Magicked Tricks,&quot; and &quot;In Mysterious Ways&quot; being the only three, and they're all comedic). Especially numerous are gritty-dark-urban-modern fantasies along the lines of Don Bassingthwaite's &quot;In Memory of,&quot; a tale of two vengeful dragon-brothers vying for fragile human lovers in a city setting. Also numerous are fringe stories that don't quite belong to any single genre because they have so few fictional elements - Matter's &quot;Water Snakes&quot; is an example.<br />Unfortunately, the settings aren't a very original lot: many stories are set in generic urban environments; there are a couple bare-bones Oriental stories; even the purely imaginary settings (such as the one in Sherman and Kushner's &quot;The Fall of Kings&quot;) didn't strike me as especially original.<br />The writing, however, is uniformly good, if totally unexceptional, fitting well with the characters that behave interestingly but almost never transcend their two-dimensionality. The sexual elements hardly ever seem over the top (though Sheppard's &quot;There Are Things Hidden from the Eyes of the Everyday&quot; is just too much), even if most storiesdo seem identical from this perspective.<br />Together with its science fiction counterpart, I consider BTL: Fantasy a quintessential resource for alternative genre fiction.	2001-07-20

These and many more witty fictions are what made Fritz Leiber one of the founding fathers of modern SF&amp;F and horror. However, no matter what your genre preference is, HERE ARE 44 STORIES THAT WILL STICK TO YOUR RIBS.<br />Of course, this does not in any way mean that every story in this half-century retrospective is exceptional. The exact opposite is true: many of the stories in this impressively large and heavy book are dull and unexciting. There is a definite impression that they were written by an undisputed master of the genre - but no rerader involvement. However, some of the better stories present make this mammoth anthology a joy to read.<br />As far as the genres represented in this volume, one can't but admit that Leiber has an undeniable gift for blurring the lines of separation: rather than being strictly science fiction or fantasy, the wide majority of stories are ridiculous fictions, absurd juxtapositions of totally unrelated elements (for example, &quot;Endfray of the Ofay&quot; is an alternate history combining magic and nuclear weaponry). Certainly, there are some recurring themes - nuclear devastation and the continuing Cold War are especially common. In their ultimate form, these &quot;idea-stories&quot; can be extremely funny, adventuresome, and provocative.<br />Interestingly, the author's style - and its evolution - adds a layer of depth and variety to the anthology: the shock-pulp of the thirties gives way to the somber fictions of the fifties and the uproarious fantasies of the sixties and seventies. The progression is completed with the excellent, unique semi-autobiographical novelettes of the eighties, which combine Leiber's personal experiences of apartment-living with some supernatural undercurrents.<br />Those looking for Fafhrd/Gray Mouser stories will be sorely disappointed - there are only five (compare to the two about chess), and they are not at all interesting. As for myself, I was disappointed by the inordinate number of typos - of the sort that evade spell-check software and confuse readers (&quot;closet&quot; instead of &quot;closest&quot;).<br />A very good restrospective anthology honoring one of the founding fathers of SF&amp;F.	2001-07-16

A surprising turn of events leaves teen-aged Josh Kerrigan twenty-seven light years from Earth on the frontier planet Solferino - with a crew of young trainees and a cruel brigadeer. But Josh's frustrated attempts to figure out Solomon Brewster's true motives are complicated by the fact that he must look after his autistic cousin Dawn and get along with the rest of the group - which includes bullies and drug-addicts.<br />&quot;Putting Up Roots&quot; is well-written, if entirely unexceptional. The characters are simple and convincingly human - even if the science lacks the &quot;wow-factor&quot; and Brewster's criminal machinations are extremely easy to figure out. The book's real merit is that it reads quickly and easily. A likely candidate for rainy-day reading, &quot;Putting Up Roots&quot; can also be categorized as a young adult novel - making it a nice, quick introduction to the genre.	2001-07-13
US	50899460	R17LF51HAF78WH	0737701587	83208843	At Issue Series - Violent Children (paperback edition)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A bad bout of the blame game.	This slim volume of &quot;At Issue&quot; targets a crisis that is as urgent as it is complex - juvenile violence and its contributing factors. The book adopts a pro-con dichotomy to illustrate the varied opinions on the subject. However, this style quickly degenerates into a clash of liberal and conservative ideologies. Ultimately, the &quot;dual&quot; expository approach conceals more information that it reveals, as the articles' authors cite increasingly ludicrous &quot;evidence&quot; to hammer in their dubious assertions.<br />Consider, for instance, Robert W. Lee's &quot;The Availability of Guns Does Not Contribute to Violent Behavior in Children.&quot; What, not at all? Lee cites a handful of &quot;positive&quot; cases, where the guns are used for self-defense, and bluntly ignores cases of the opposite. His closing argument is a Confederate victory at the cost of armed 15-year-olds' lives. Admire Wade F. Horn's &quot;Fatherlessness Contributes to Juvenile Violence&quot; article, which poses religion as the ultimate tool in parental authority. He proceeds to &quot;trace&quot; the exact &quot;road&quot; children take from upright to promiscuous. Next he rigidly defines both parents' roles - with father as the &quot;hands-on&quot; authority of risks and punishment. This isn't controversy - this is simple poor taste!<br />The articles originate from several backgrounds: academic, testimonial, media. Unfortunately, this is easy to divine only because of the spectrum of flaws each approach exhibits. The reader is faced with almost everything imaginable - from some articles' failure to organize raw statistical data in a useful manner, to others' dismissive nature (sorry, Mr. Males, but no matter how much I sympathize with your way of thinking, I cannot tolerate ignorance of basic facts). A few articles weren't subjected to a rigorous enough selection process, which leads to their lack of relevance and failure to address the task at hand (Tom Kalinske's article comes to mind). Several articles are obtuse exercises in showmanship - like Steven Barr's dramatic presentation of a videogame experience (&quot;You can't get away!&quot; the boy said with a maniacal sneer...). Lastly, we've all heard some of these arguments - namely, Joanne Cantor's &quot;Television Contributes to Violent Behavior in Children&quot;, which is a flagrant case of the &quot;we can build you&quot; methodology, which denies children an active role in their own formative experience (though her &quot;Momy, I'm Scared&quot; is handy enough).<br />Sadly, the editor never takes the time to sum up the basic known facts, and all articles cite them differently. Without some defined point of departure, this &quot;At Issue&quot; ultimately becomes a Rorschach test. Though designed to give the reader a passing familiarity with the subject, this volume only manages to communicate one thing - confusion.	2001-07-02

After alotting time for repair, they set off exploring the alien planet. Soon they discover artifacts left by an unfathomable civilization - an absurd factory where bizarre objects are produced only to be molten down again; giant translucent disks spinning on mirrored tracks; metal wreckage and stone cities - all weathered, abandoned. Soon they find the inhabitants of this strange realm - &quot;doublers.&quot; Piles of them - all dead - in ditches, in graves, in wells. The explorers find a tower filled with glass eggs - a skeleton in each. Who built all this? Who is killing the doublers off? What happened - or is happening here?<br />What if Lovecraft wrote &quot;Solaris&quot;? &quot;Eden&quot; might have been the result. Tortuously, elaborately written - it seems twice the length it really is - &quot;Eden&quot; is a novel of man's total inability to understand what's alien and different. Lem sets out to awe and dwarf us, which he acomplishes easily enough, but then he goes on and does it again - and again, and again, and again, and again - in the course of one, then two hundred pages, then two and half, all without offering the briefest glimmer of logic or revelation. Really, the reader can instead glean all of Eden's illogical, mystifying wonders from the endpapers and not have to deal with the book's confusing descriptions, which are written (or translated) loosely enough to diminish the impact. Things run in parallel and perpendicular to each other, they double and intertwine, weave and vibrate, but there is little sense of place, of wholeness, of direction, of time. In the very first scene, I had trouble deciding which way the ship landed: on the side or upside down? In which direction are the spacemen climbing? Where is the door? <br />When the revelation finally does come - of Eden's nature and sociology - it is stated incredibly vaguely and can be barely understood, and what CAN beunderstood seems rather predictable and pedestrian - one of the characters keeps cautioning others from forming human preconceptions about Eden - but in the end those preconceptions turn out to be true. There is a mild sense of awe and that's about it.<br />Lem's unique style shows through on occasion - in the &quot;standard-issue&quot; characters, in his way with description, in the massive amounts of unobtrusive technobabble - but it is hardly one of his best works - that award goes for &quot;Memoirs Found in a Bathtub&quot;, &quot;Star Diaries&quot;, &quot;Futurological Congress&quot;, &quot;Solaris&quot;, and so on. Read &quot;Eden&quot; if you want a taste of Lem - it's modestly entertaining - but don't expect to be blown away.	2001-07-02

Nooo, they spend three and a half centuries militarizing, industrializing, preparing to deflect the imagined alien threat. The invasion never came, and Werel instead colonized its neighbor planet - Yeowe. Exporting male slaves - &quot;assets&quot; - and working them to death in the mines or in the fields, the Four Corporations started a predatory program of exploitation and destruction of the environment. Soon, however, the shipping costs rose, and it became more profitable to ship women as well as men. Hoping to establish a self-replenishing slave workpool, Bosses on Werel underestimated the tenacity of female assets, with catastrophic results. First at Nadari, and then all over the place, slave rebellions flared up, soon combining into a costly thirty-year war. Waging war across the vast gulf of space is difficult business, and eventually Werel's stranglehold on Yeowe freedmen was broken. However, no war can be won, no matter what the cost: Werelian social order is crumbling under the weight of me-too young revolutionaries; and Yeowe has regressed into a mishmash of gang warfare and cruel mysoginistic practices. This is where agents of the Ekumen come into the picture...<br />Deftly amalgamating United States history and her Hainish universe, Ursula LeGuin has produced yet another masterful work dealing with personal freedoms and one's social obligations, adopting a format she has made familiar in such other works as her &quot;Fisherman of the Inland Sea&quot; and &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot;: a series of novellas connected by setting and characters.<br />- closely mirroring LeGuin's own &quot;Tehanu&quot;, &quot;Betrayals&quot; speaks of an aging woman's willingness to see past a disgraced revolutionary's sins and love him for his humanity;<br />- in &quot;Forgiveness Day&quot;, she brings together two opposites who can't seeeach other as anything but ignorami - Solly, the Ekumen's Envoy to Werel, who can't see past its people's stuffy ritualism, and Teyeo, a Werelian soldier assigned as Solly's guard, who finds Solly garish and dimwitted - and makes them fall in love;<br />- her &quot;Man of the People&quot; documents the personal quest of a Hainish villager, who, unable to adapt neither to his village's ritualistic beliefs, nor to the university's vast intellectual breadth, finally finds peace of heart as a social reformer on tumultuous Yeowe;<br />- lastly, &quot;A Woman's Liberation&quot; tells of a woman's struggle for personal freedom that she can find neither in slavery, nor in revolutionary movements, only in learning. Those who read any of Frederick Douglass' autobiographies may find this somewhat familiar.<br />My only personal qualm is that LeGuin - however measurely and masterfully - depicts literally everything and anything as a profound formative experience, neither right nor wrong, but just sort of there. None of her characters seems to feel passionate, explosive emotions. They are all placid, timid lumps of clay. Furthermore, almost every novella prominently features at least one sex scene (which apparrently takes a center place in LeGuin's idology). The occasional profanity feels artificial and sophomoric. <br />Each and every time I open a LeGuin book I know that some aspect of my life is about to be depicted as &quot;human&quot; and &quot;necessary&quot; and packaged in a tiny parcel and then spoon-fed to me in a most unobtrusive, all-pervasive manner possible. I can only take so much of &quot;All knowledge is local&quot; before I explode. I can hear that &quot;everything is right in its own way&quot;  only so many times before I stop reading.	2001-06-29
US	50899460	R2Z71XSAPD8UWG	0312864515	15843283	Rebel Sutra	Books	5	6	6	N	N	One man's dream.	Though few people suspect it, the forsaken colony world of Maya - &quot;Illusion&quot; - is aptly named. This frigid, volcanic world is dominated by a twin human settlement: the Mountain - a domed city of the genetically-altered Changed, worshipful of their deranged AI god - the Exchange; and Babelion - the slum city of the would-be wardens to the Changed - the petty, idling humans. What no one on Maya knows, however, is that they are not the only remaining colony - indeed, a whole interstellar Empire has sprung up and fractured while the denizens of Maya shared their delusion. Now the Empire is all but dead, usurped by the Pretender Emperor - and it is up to a hapless scientist to save the last Cloned Empress embryos to perpetuate the rightful bloodline. In clandestinely giving one of the cloned embryos life among the elitist Changed, Suu-Suu has made a fateful miscalculation - for though Della went power-mad without her training as Empress, her mixed-blood son - Anselm - was destined to uncover the true extent of Maya's illusion - even at the cost of chaos.<br />This sophisticatedly twisted melange of &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is passionately, exhaustively well-written. Shariann Lewitt has adopted an interesting internal structure - the book is told in two halves from two characters' perspectives. Della's story is presented first, in the form of a memoir. It begins at the finale - the revolution - and goes on essentially backwards through Della's time with the Tinkers (Suu-Suu's mysterious band of banished off-worlders) and her brief tryst with Arsen - the young revolutionary from Babelion - Anselm's father. Anselm's story is told in a more conventional fashion - it begins with his forced flight from the treacherous Mountain (the secret of his mixed-blood parentage is anathema to the Changed) and continues on through his time with Babelion's meandering, petty revolutionaries, his tutelage under the Hindu priests, and his final confrontation with his fate. Indeed, Anselm's story is a search for meaning and self-discovery, a quest for identity, a struggle against his own dehumanization and needless symbolism, his battle against those who would have (knowingly or not) made him a mundane pawn of the old . Ultimately, his is a search for truth.<br />The novel deftly interconnects its parts by having all stories told by knowing first-person narrators in the past tense - there are numerous internal redundancies, parallels, cases of deja vu, and so on. Lewitt interestingly infuses her tale with Hindu mythology and philosophy - and makes it perfectly accessible to the reader. Her voice as a writer has a tasteful twang of femininity - similar to LeGuin's but less labyrinthine. At times, &quot;Rebel Sutra&quot; had me literally spellbound in its clutches.<br />It does have several flaws, most obvious of them being the numerous allusions to Anselm's apparent homosexuality - which is fine in itself but doesn't quite fit with the story (did she retain this tendency from her participation in &quot;Bending the Landscape&quot;, or vice versa?). Several characters are made deliberately flat only so they can add artificial depth to Anselm's dramatic struggle. The author enjoys making allusions to revelations given further on in the book - whcih frequently makes sense within the context of the story, though I hate being baited by lines such as &quot;...but the actual reason for it being the way it is we didn't learn until much later.&quot;<br />Nonetheless, this is a powerful, excellently written work of fiction. Sorry to say it - but this is a &quot;must-read.&quot;	2001-06-25

A seemingly simple setup: combine two science fiction templates: an alien landscape - outer space, another planet, the fifties; and an Other - an alien, a foreigner, a renegade, a stranger in a strange land; now, the twist - the Other must be homosexual. How much can be written based on this premise? Volumes.<br />Start with the brilliant &quot;Sex, Guns, and Baptists&quot; by Keith Hartman, a wicked story of a world gone fundamentalist and a gay detective hired by a jealous wife to find out her husband's sexual orientation. Continue on in the same vein to Bassingthwaite's &quot;Who Plays with Sin&quot;, a cyberpunk yarn as good as if not better than anything Gibson has ever written. Plunge into Klages' &quot;Time Gypsy&quot; and discover that the mindset of the fifties is just as alien as that of the previous stories. Examine the adage of &quot;looks don't matter&quot; in Wendy Rathbone's masterful &quot;The Beautiful People.&quot; Nancy Kress contributes a thought-provoking tale of survival - at the cost of total isolation, in her &quot;State of Nature.&quot; The cost that the artificial intelligence in Shariann Lewitt's (her &quot;Rebel Sutra&quot; is at the top of my reading list as I write this) &quot;A Real Girl&quot; must pay for her humanity is mind-boggling. The viewpoint character in Bamberg's &quot;Love's Last Farewell&quot; has already paid the ultimate price - he is the last gay man on Earth. Tiedemann's &quot;Surfaces&quot;  dissects the popular tendency to partition humans into characteristics - and assign blame and praise to them instead of the person underneath. Steele's &quot;The Flying Triangle&quot; and Sperry's &quot;On Vacation&quot; take a more relaxed approach and depict a more accepting - or at least redeemable - humanity.<br />Out of the twenty-one stories in this volume, more than half deliver much more than promised, and none are really disappointing. In a few cases the authors choke on a message that is too large and fail to communicateit well, but these are rare. Overall, the original subject matter lends a new degree of richness, of credence, of power to the well-worn genre. Each character is so much more an expression of the author's mind, better fleshed-out and rounded because of the innovative undertones. An excellent, eye-opening anthology.	2001-06-18

Noting the presence of several high-intelligence species, they chose one and accelerated its development in an effort to gain a new ally in time for the impending galactic war. But when a young ethnologist named Rocannon falls in love with Semley - a golden-haired native who has come to claim her inheritance from the spacemen's museum - he embarks on a voyage of discovery that will show how many of Fomalhaut's secrets still lie undiscovered. Rocannon's mission soon becomes one of utmost urgency: his ship destroyed, he discovers that a rebel faction plans to use the world as a base, and that he himself must warn the League of the peril - even if he must cross Fomalhaut II from pole to pole in search of a working ansible.<br />To label &quot;Rocannon's World&quot; a work of science fiction is a gross misnomer. LeGuin's first foray into SF - her first Ekumen novel - is almost entirely fantasy. Whatever science fiction there is in it (not much) is extremely pedestrian, so much a collection of deus-ex-machina plot devices that the author herself decries their use in the foreword. The fantasy, however, is much more palatable, though in making the world and its peoples LeGuin shows an extreme over-reliance on Norse myths. The writing shows glints of LeGuin's future greatness, but the style is awkward, unpracticed. The book's utmost brevity did not allow LeGuin to develop the major characters to any sufficient extent, who always remain rather flat and predictable. Rocannon himself is a carbon copy of Ged, though he lacks Ged's richness of character.<br />Rocannon's quest is artificial, and, on the whole, the book's setup - the first fifty pages or so - are haphazardly put together and not at all easy to read. Only through sheer effort did I choke them down. The going does get easier later on, when LeGuin unfolds the setting and describes the indigenous peoples and their myths. Nonetheless, I was never quite ableto rid myself of the feeling that I was reading an overwritten short story - which this book once was. <br />Recommended reading to LeGuin completists.	2001-06-13

Mankind has experienced a series of cataclysmic setbacks and withdrew itself from all celestial bodies save Earth itself. On the dawn of the twenty-third century, a second Rama craft is sighted. And while it is ostensibly identical to the first ship, the human emissaries to the extrasolar hulk come from a civilization ages removed from the original crew...<br />&quot;Rama II&quot; is quite a puzzle. The first book was a complete artistic statement, with a well-defined ending that tied up what loose ends there were. Why the second part in the &quot;series&quot; was written at all is a mystery. It's like painting a second Mona Lisa, or at least trying to: the Clarke-Lee tandem fails spectacularly. Superpowers, deception, magical visions, you name it - it's here, and none of it fits together.<br />The authors addressed the complaints about the first book's dull characters by reducing the cast to an even dozen and making each member a Certifiably Life-Like Character. Namely, they endowed each with a single trait and exaggerated that trait to an absurd extent. The second Rama crew seems to be on the verge of a fistfight. They visit the Pope and abort fetuses and poison each other. Oh, and they're all drunkards to boot. Francesca Sabatini is an especially noxious character: she is ruthless, backstabbing, markedly verbose, irritable, impulsive, and bloodthirsty. Why people like Francesca are on the crew at all is beyond me.<br />Earth has definitely regressed since the first book. Instead of a &quot;solar federation&quot; the reader gets a xenophobic Earth recovering from a crippling internal collapse. Sadly, the first institutions to revive are the church and the media. Most of the plot is governed by the two. Two out of the twelve crew members are reporters (driven by monetary incentives to make the expedition as melodramatic as possible) and one is the Catholic emissary (who in the course of the book receives a divine revelation). Oh, and we also get all the requisites: the Honest Altruist, the Embodiment of Scientific Genius, the Kindly Soul, the Panicked Madman, and the Happy-Go-Lucky Heli Pilot.<br />The anachronisms are as obvious, if not more: Earth of the twenty-third century seems to run on transistors and audio casettes. The Soviet Union also seems to have survived everything, including a global cataclysm and its own collapse two years after the book was written.<br />Even the majestic Rama spacecraft has lost its grandeur. In fact, the alien ship is mere trimming for the failure of a character-driven plot that this book has. Furthermore, the authors gave Rama a decisively low-tech twist (surveilance cameras?), and overequipped the characters (helicopters? land rovers? chairlifts?). There is much crawling through corridors and gawking at the buttons and switches. Apparently, Lee forgot that this is &quot;Rama&quot;, not &quot;Sphere&quot;. The desert island romance borders on the absurd.<br />A marginal book utterly destroyed by childish skulduggery.	2001-06-09

I was quite bored with the Otherland series when I picked up \\"Sea of Silver Light\\", the final volume. During the three previous volumes the plot development has gone from excellent (\\"City of Golden Shadow\\") to bad (\\"River of Blue Fire\\") to worse (\\"Mountain of Black Glass\\"), which was hardly an incentive to sit down and start reading something as time-consuming as another Otherland book. More specifically, I was very disappointed with the artificial \\"climax\\" at the end of the third book, which to me seemed an intentional effort to recapture the readers' wandering attention. So it was with some distrust and trepidation that I finally got a copy of this 922-page-long monstrosity, by far the longest book I've read.<br />A minute to sum up everything that transpired so far, in a very small nutshell: children worldwide collapse after experiencing mysterious psychological trauma online; guided by an enigmatic behind-the-scenes presence, a band of self-appointed heroes invade a super-real network built by the richest of the rich to function as an immortality machine; soon, however, our heroes realize that not only cannot they find any hint of a cure, not only are their efforts to bring down the network futile and unnoticed - they can't even escape Otherland themselves! The two consequent volumes detail the band's mad scrabble to escape, but as they jump from one demented virtual world to another, clues begin to emerge about the network's nature, the souls captive inside it, and the operating system - the network's heart, which may be the greatest mystery of all...<br />\\"Sea of Silver Light\\" marks the return of the first volume's furious pacing, but it has far more meat to grind. After having to make do with hints and implications for several thousand pages, it's extremely rewarding to see things work out and gain significance. At long last, Williams shifts the focus from the heroes - who have become flat and tired - to the Other himself, and his monumental agony. When revealed, his identity is both tragic and frightening. Williams also ties up the RL subplots, but not before unifying them into a concerted effort; at the end the reader is treated not to one, but four or five separate showdowns: Sellars' (whose significance is finally revealed) struggle to free the online captives, Olga's suicidal mission inside Jongleur's tower, Calliope's search for Dread, Dulcinea's moral struggle, etc. Numerous background characters (Jongleur, Azador, Ava) are finally brought out of suspended animation and given large, meaningful roles to play. The virtual worlds the heroes travel through are very creative - both Dread's mutant worlds and the Other's own \\"dark space\\". The trademark media highlights at the beginning of each chapter become especialy entertaining....<br />Easily the best volume in the series, and, quite possibly, the best book I've read all year.	2001-06-06

In 2130 an asteroid-tracking system discovered a titanic extrasolar object approaching the sun. Soon it was discovered that the object - dubbed &quot;Rama&quot; - was hollow. The dispatched expedition confirmed its artificial origins and discovered something far more startling - after its million-year sleep, Rama was awakening...<br />As readers of science fiction, we expect a string of easy answers to follow every question. &quot;Rama&quot; does the reverse - it answers none of the questions it poses. It is intentionally unfulfilling. Clarke almost flaunts his cardboard characters, and the quixotic portrayal of humanity (the squabbling, the polygamy, the &quot;orbital orgies&quot;), and in doing so he expertly draws a stark contrast between Man and Rama. The book is very nearly a dystopia.<br />However, on the surface &quot;Rama&quot; is flat and dispassionate, continually anticlimactic, essentially lacking in tension, reader engagement, plot and character development. The science has turned sour since the book was written in the seventies - there is an obvious disparity between cause and effect (colonies on Mercury and Triton, but astronomers still have to apply for &quot;computer time&quot;?). Any reader who isn't &quot;in&quot; on Clarke's ruse will hardly find any portion of the book interesting, possibly excepting Rama's intricate structure (I found it to be a mental exercise equalling the Battle Room in &quot;Ender's Game&quot;). On a purely visual level, there is quite a number of things to see inside Rama: several cities, enormous spires, and organic sea - especially fun since Rama's inhabitable surface is the inside, so the sea is overhead as well as underfoot (prepare for an upside-down tidal wave!). However, if that were the book's sole appeal, Clarke would've surely gone with an impersonal &quot;journal&quot; format - or not have written it at all. The contrast between the stock characters and the alien hulk increases enjoyment, even if the characters are a nuisance.	2001-05-26

This is the tale of a withdrawn man caught in a loveless marriage, who breaks down when his harridan wife unknowingly ends his love affair with a young servant girl.<br />&quot;Ethan Frome&quot; is sunk into the morass of Victorian values and standards, and, as such, is clearly targeting a subtler and more impressionable audience than the one available today. Several scenes which were doubtlessly touching and gentle back when the book was written are now hopelessly quaint and devoid of meaning. Wharton wonderfully communicates the innate reticence of the local people, but she does so in a way that fails to engage. The book carries an air of utmost restraint. The writing itself is quite sophisticated, beautifully descriptive, but the author's choice of words is a bit odd (&quot;groping&quot; is hardly the word I would use to describe a parting kiss). The vast majority of characters fail to interest, partially because they are hardly fleshed out. Zenobia, Ethan's overbearing wife, is perhaps the only one who is sufficiently detailed and participates in most of the action. In essence, all of the book revolves around her, since she is the cause of Ethan's captivity and suffering. The book drags hopelessly until the climax in the last twenty or so pages. The convention of a narrator who is abandoned after the first few pages does nothing to ease the ennui. The book is severely overwritten: though a novel, it should clearly be a short story.<br />A potentially interesting tragic romance marred by excessive length.	2001-05-23

Ever since being released from a Viet Cong POW camp, Matt longed for a calm life, and Alex is just happy to be with her husband. As a recuperative effort, the couple decide to buy a sailboat and take a prolonged cruise of the Bahamas.... <br />Sharyl Jane Stafford easily bursts onto the tired and crowded scene of suspense fiction with a gripping melodrama about a brave couple willing to face death in order to save each other. Stafford expertly manipulates the reader's emotions, time and time again making him feel impotent, powerless, at the mercy of villains and maniacs. The canvas Stafford pints is palpably psychotic - her command of description is fantastic and the book produces a heavy, lasting impression (she even names brands - anyone up for Scopolamine ear patches?). The reader will feel right at home in this Bahamanian nightmare.<br />Sure, the book could use a map and a glossary of terms (\\"the main halyard cleat\\" is just about gibberish to me). The climax.... seems implausible in view of the novel's jarring realism. The book is somewhat spoiled by the flat, predictable characters, who don't seem to fit their parts: I had the impression of them as actors who are not too eager to play their assigned roles; as they incredulously recited their lines, I could almost imagine cheerful smiles playing on their lips. There are a few problems with pacing - the plot hardly moves until page 100, and I'm not sure about the value of the split-viewpoint narration: I am willing to read about villains justifying their actions only so many times; this is \\"telling-not-showing\\" of the worst degree. Nevertheless, the novel continually haunts the reader, compelling him to read on.<br />Overall, a potent debut.	2001-05-19

I was almost ready to give up on LeGuin after reading &quot;The Telling&quot;, &quot;Tehanu&quot;, and &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; in consecution, when I noticed this collection of short stories. I was pleasantly surprised. The heavy-handed moralizing and the sour tone are replaced with a sense of harmony, energy. One gets the impression that the writer simply let herself write to her heart's content.<br />The first few are short word-sketches, demonstrating LeGuin's surprising versatility. &quot;First Contact with the Gorgonids&quot; is written with prosaic wit, &quot;Kerastion&quot; is powerfully poetic, &quot;Newton's Sleep&quot; is a cautionary, postapocalyptic parable, etc. The book also includes a mini-cycle of three Ekumen stories, centered on instantaneous travel and its startling side effect: when intelligent beings are teleported, reality breaks down into individual perceptions (think Rashomon). The first, &quot;Shobies' Story&quot;, documents the first-ever experimental flight. The second, &quot;Dancing to Ganam&quot;, documents an exploratory expedition where every member gets different impressions of the natives' intent: where one sees ritual, another sees deceit. The last is possibly the first and only of LeGuin's time travel stories, telling of a homesick man who decides to correct the choice he made eighteen years ago. The second and third stories are especially well-written, keeping the reader guessing until the very end.<br />A very nice collection for disillusioned readers.	2001-05-16

The rest have been turned into bloodthirsty abominations whose only goal is to pry, to tease Robert out of his shelter. By day, Robert mercilessly destroys them as they are frozen with rigor mortis at dawn. His life has turned into a game of survival against all odds. He lives to kill.<br />&quot;I Am Legend&quot; desperately needs some cheap suspense. Otherwise, it just isn't scary. The novel's horror aspect is almost totally obscured by the measurely, prosaic depiction of its central character, his general safety in his well-protected home, and his scientific pursuits. True, there are several very powerful episodes, such as when Robert recalls the first days of the plague, when the victims of the desease return to a semblance of life. But other than that, there is few major thrills. In other words, it's not Matheson's goal to be scary. He depicts a complex, original, emotional mindscape: the gradual dehumanization of the survivor, and the mirror-image humanization of his predator-prey. Even despite the hurried ending, the gradual understanding of Robert's transformation is gripping. Furthermore, Matheson postulates a well-grounded scientific explanation of vampirism: the undeath and bloodlust are caused by a bacterium, and the fear of the cross, lack of reflection, etc. are given psychological causes.<br />The short stories following the main piece are a mixed bunch. A number of them are exceedingly straightforward, word sketches of improbable concepts, like so many &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; episodes. None of them are really scary. Matheson settles for dark irony (&quot;'When did she die?' 'As soon as I get home.'&quot;). Some, like &quot;From Shadowed Places&quot;, are outrageously old-fashioned.<br />Read for the novel, skim the stories.	2001-05-14

Wenau, the edenic commune formed by the former citizens of the Well-Built City, has once again fallen under Below's curse. Now it is up to a reformed Cley, who is now a herbalist, to journey into the werewolf-infested ruins in search of the antidote, only to discover that Below himself has succumbed to his engineered plague, and the only antidote is concealed inside Below's mind.<br />&quot;Memoranda&quot;, the second in the Cley trilogy, suffers from a tone of absurd pomp, as the previous one suffered from its lugubrious arrogance. The plot is unsatisfying, because there are no undertones, no backstory or foreshadowing, no emotional significance. The narration suffers from sudden bouts of pointless immaturity, instantly preventing any and all suspension of disbelief (like Quismal, the horse that frothes at both ends). The characters are meaningless to the reader, because they are extremely flat, and, in any case, Ford presents them as mere figments of Below's imgination. Ford has perfected the fleeting, episodic feeling of dreams, but it is time to move on, or at least expand the topic. Why use such sophisticated language if it goes to waste? Ford states facts and events, without involving the reader, who ends up being a disinterested, neutral presence: the island is flating in the air (&quot;Is that so?&quot;); the Delicate eats people (&quot;Oh, is that what it does?&quot;).<br />Many readers (myself among them) feel compelled to see this series to the end, but reading &quot;Memoranda&quot; is like reading a napkin.	2001-05-08

Unfortunately, after turning the last page I was thoroughly underwhelmed. Gone is the wild freedom of vision, the vast, all-encompassing scope. LeGuin sets out to repopulate her world with sympathetic, influential women, but that world is a stifling, mundane place. Earthsea is no longer a mythical place close to heart, but a world in its own right: big, bleak, and routine. No longer does the reader associate him or herself with the mage hero - the stories in &quot;Tales&quot; take place in a world life-like enough to reduce the reader to a disembodied presence.<br />Intermittently I found myself staring at the page, wondering: where is the flowing prose? the masterful pacing? the lovely descriptions? The accessibility of the narrative has definitely taken a plunge.<br />In &quot;Tales&quot; LeGuin attempts to knit together her world's fractured past and present into a unified, continuous whole. She tries to accomplish this across five pieces of short story and novella length, some of them poetic, most not, generally middling quality as far as LeGuin goes. These tales are: &quot;The Finder&quot;, about a finder mage called Otter who founded the school on Roke as a beacon of freedom in the dark time after the last king's death; &quot;Darkrose and Diamond&quot;, about a merchant's son, who gives up his freedom in exchange for his inheritance and subdues his spirit, only to set it free in forbidden love; &quot;Bones of the Earth&quot;, about Ogion the Silent, the fateful earthquake he calmed at Gont Port, and the one life it claimed; &quot;On the High Marsh&quot;, in which the reader find out how abstract power can drive a man mad and how using that power to peaceful ends can restore him; &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, about the masters of Roke divided against a wilful woman and how the men's language is not enough to name the fiery female spirit.<br />Of all the tales, only &quot;Bones&quot; and &quot;Marsh&quot; come anywhere close to the three original novels. Others meander and run overlong. Yet others are preachy. &quot;Dragonfly&quot; is a distillate of &quot;Tehanu&quot;; it also explains the direction LeGuin is taking her world in the upcoming novel (think back to &quot;Tehanu's&quot; enigmatic ending).<br />The addendum on Earthsea' history, culture, language, and magic is informative, but, again, offers little that a persistent reader will find worth knowing. All in all, &quot;Tales&quot; is even more out of place than the previous volume.	2001-05-05

When he and his colleagues smuggled a few LOVs to Earth and used themselves as test subjects, Virgil never suspected that two of his friends would soon be dead, and he himself on the run from international law, on his way to the place where the mutant LOV colonies made landfall...<br />&quot;A Limit of Vision&quot; is confused. In the beginning it tries to be an edgy, sci-fi thriller, but soon slows down to a crawl and attempts to be a hard SF novel. The beginning features a moderately exciting escape sequence, a satellite crash, and a tidal wave, all in about fifty pages. Then the plot abruptly stops. All characters quickly and conveniently sort out into heroes and villains. The heroes suddenly become shallow and predictable, and what they're doing isn't very exciting: they farm the surviving LOVs in fish ponds, while the outside world tries to starve them out of their little reservation.<br />&quot;Limit of Vision&quot; treats its general subject matter - LOVs, an intelligent form of nanotechnology - in an extremely simplistic and straightforward manner, with no ambiguities. Despite having an incredible knack for mutation and problem-solving, they don't seem to pose any threat at all, and their &quot;mind-enhancing&quot; capabilities are hardly taken advantage of.<br />The book's tone is essentially dead. The narration moves quickly, but leaves no lasting impression. Characterization is lacking and follows predictable patterns: a blossoming romance between the male and female heroes (who would've thought!?); an enemy who becomes an ally, etc.<br />In a nutshell: lacking in both premise and execution.	2001-04-28

When farmer Flint died, his widow lived on at the farm in solitude, only occasionally visited by her few friends who trusted her despite her foreign looks. Her children had long since left - her daughter Apple living with her husband downriver, her son Spark sailing the seas. The old woman's life didn't change much when she took in a vagrant's child, beaten, raped, burned with fire and left for dead. But then she recieved a message from a dying mage who bid her come... So begins the last tale of Earthsea, the tale of Tenar and her burnt foundling, Therru.<br />&quot;Tehanu&quot; is a painful book to read. It deals with death, powerlessness, depletion, misery, resentment, and jealousy, and it does so on a much more personal scale than the previous books in the series. Whereas Ged, being a powerful mage, was always an outsider, standing outside and looking in, Tenar (or Goha, as LeGuin renames her) commands no special favor or respect. And while Ged was somewhat cold and aloof, Goha is visibly cautious and valiant, vigilant and caring, womanly and motherly.<br />In &quot;Tehanu&quot; LeGuin seeks to establish the woman as naturally free and unbound, but she does so in a fashion that is sour and vengeful. There are very few likable male charactes in &quot;Tehanu&quot;, the majority striving to harm and demean Goha for going beyond her customary place in life. Some shun her, others insult her. One even strikes her mute and parades her around on a leash, like a dog. Ged is a pathetic shade of his former self: without his power, he is despondent and irritable. In his case, LeGuin essentially states the exact antithesis of the philosophy she presented in the previous Earthsea books.<br />&quot;Tehanu&quot; takes a poststructuralist approach, skimping on definite plot and villains in favor of character development and occasional poetic episodes. To fill in the gaps, there is a lot of musing on the woman's role in life, but, again, that is done by demeaning and devaluating men. Whereas man &quot;is full of his grand man-meat&quot;, but empty once his power is gone, the woman &quot;goes back before the darkness&quot;, her roots sunk deep, impossible to eradicate. In another recurring metaphor, LeGuin portrays men as dragons, wild and greedy and predatory, with wings that they don't deserve, and women as humans, warm and studious, but without power. Apparently, LeGuin wants to establish the woman as a harridan as well man's equal.<br />Similarly, I had significant trouble accepting the short, confusing deus-ex-machina ending, which hardly pertains to the story, and generates more questions than answers. Definitely not what I wanted in the series' final ending.	2001-04-25

This is outre steampunk deluxe. <br />Creating a work of such vast intricacy is equivalent to holding one's breath for a half hour and then exhaling a thunderstorm. Without warning, a virtual unknown by the name of China Mieville generated a startling, brooding tongue-and-cheek fantasy that bridges the gap between Bulgakov's noble demons, Jeffrey Ford's nebulous abstractions, and William Gibson's steely mindscapes. But unlike Bulgakov's, Mieville's demons are cruel and hideous; unlike Ford's Well-Built City, Mieville's New Crobuzon actually lives and breaths (or rather simmers and sputters); and unlike Neuromancer's all-business characters, the people from the pages of &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot; like to have their fun.<br />Mieville writes with consistent wit and sting. His originality is of the spontaneously outrageous type (I especially enjoyed the electric &quot;sacrifice without the sacrifice&quot;, and the rest of Mieville's wildly imaginative technomagic). The author's command of the language is outstanding (I actually had to fumble for my dictionary), and his imagery is vivid and grisly (though there is a good deal of foul language, and some of the narration runs overlong). Mieville's characters are genuinely original, each one having his own poison - or passion(Isaac, an outcast scientist is an especially nice surprise - he's burly and hairy; throughout the book he comes to realize that he possesses a good deal of previously unnoticed virtues and soft spots). The book focuses on rebels and outcasts as its heroes - a garuda raptor-man, whose wings were cut off for a crime he cannot divulge; a fiery political critic for a banned publication; an enraptured khepri (scarab-man) artist working on a terrifying masterpiece at gunpoint. The non-humans are spectacular: we have khepri, garuda, cactus-people, a million species of warped mutants (the Torque is a nice allusion to the A-bomb), the Weaver (a poetic, transdimensional spider demigod). Mieville's magic breaks all conventions - it is so well integrated with the overall culture.<br />Unfortunately, the book runs into some problems: the antagonistic force the heroes are trying to destroy - the hypnotic, mind-devouring slake-moths - just don't seem much of a threat on a global scale; the plot only begins to unwind some two hundred pages into the book - everything previous sets the scene, tone, and characters; the cheerful, wildly nihilistic tone lags as the book speeds towards the conclusion - for a good fifty pages the reader is kept in the dark about the last resort plans the heres are trying to execute. The reader starts groping for answers, but that's not Mieville's job. Dissatisfaction results. Fortunately, the last chapter is absolutely spectacular.<br />I'm definitely waiting to read more works by Mieville.	2001-04-21

Heinlein's &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot; made me consistetly uncomfortable because I could never quite rid myself of the impression that the author was advancing the idea of the government as a benevolent, motherly institution. The main character's time about the Sisu, a veritable space city of the clannish Free Traders, is an excellent chance for the author to preach: he justifies excessive nationalism by trying to differentiate narrow-mindedness from ignorance; Heinlein depicts personal conflict in terms of a machine component in need of an oiling; and tradition (&quot;no matter how pig-headed&quot;) is just the casing necessary to keep the parts from spilling; in several places Heinlein ridicules pacifism and admonishes that youth are best suited for war. The rest of the book provides further continual discourse on balancing the individual and the community. The Losians are a clear parody of communism. The character's time on the Hegemonic vessel is a spoof on bureaucracy. Heinlein's Engineers are in actuality lucid scientists - but try as they might arguing with Grandmother Sam, no one will pay attention to them.<br />The under(over?)lying plot didn't really interest me except at the outset, where we find the child protagonist, Thorby, bought at a slaver's auction by an unseemly beggar, Buslim the Wise. Baslim happens to be more than he seems - he teaches Thorby various feats of memory, and how to be a proper, humane person. Baslim is also puzzled by Thorby's enigmatic parentage. The rest of the book details Thorby's journey to find his kin, picking up whatever lessons life teaches him on the way. Nevertheless, as a main character Thorby just isn't interesting. Despite having slaved for many different masters on several planets, he lacks an exotic psychological flavor. He also says &quot;uh...&quot; a great deal, and overall he is an archetypal teenager of the fifties.<br />Similarly, despite being short on the science, the fictional aspect of this book hasn't aged gracefully: Heinlein's spaceships are just big battle cruisers, and his computers are simply big calculators.<br />I'm not one to judge, but heed my words: this just doesn't seem the inspiring classic it is said to be. The lessons it offers are heavy-handed and questionable at best.	2001-04-14
US	50899460	R19Y71QLN6M4PR	081011495X	709211064	A Stanislaw Lem Reader (Rethinking Theory)	Books	3	14	15	N	N	The man behind the books.	This slim volume isn't as much an introduction as a motley collection of interviews with Stanislav Lem, through which the author attempts to expose Lem's personal ideology. There is an overview of Lem's works - courtesy of the author, a pair of interviews (1992 and 1994), and a short essay written by Lem about his futurological masterpiece, &quot;Summa Technologiae&quot; (1964, essay written in 1991). The first problem the book runs into is that it's not particularly informative. I really hoped for a deeper analysis of Lem's works. In the interviews, Lem merely uses them to exemplify his beliefs. Furthemore, Lem himself comes off a bit patronizing and self-promoting. He repeatedly makes smug comments about his literary competition, several movements in philosophy, and a particular Polish critic who wrote an unduly scathing review of &quot;Summa.&quot; Lastly, a good deal of the interviews become redundant. Lem's responses run long, and he manages to bring most to the followings few conclusions: the world can never be perfectly understood, or even fathomed; moderation is the safest philosophy - tertium datur; truth is in the eye of the beholder; language compromises any attempts at hard analysis; anyone who fails to believe that is misguided. Now that I think about it, Lem sounds very much like his GOLEM XIV. Nevertheless, he manages to make several interesting points about himself and his works: he proudly reiterates that he is most certainly not the alpha and omega of the European, or even Polish philosophical society; that his magnitude as a futurologist and philosopher is (mistakenly) overstated; and that his works are largely testing grounds for his evolving ideology. <br />The interviews portray Lem's faith in mankind as slight. He finds humanity as somewhat vain, and currently degenerating. An especially hard-hitting forecast of his predicts a deluge of information that will drown civilization. This examination of Lem's repeatedly frustrated attempts to bringthe cosmic forces of logic to crack the tough nut of the Western civilization made me aware of just what I want from Lem as a reader: I want a book where mankind is awed and humiliated in numbers sufficient to produce a positive effect. I want the cosmos to teach man a lesson. I want an emergency exit.	2001-04-11
US	50899460	R3BFKIHDGGA41P	0156441802	563363980	Imaginary Magnitude	Books	3	5	17	N	N	Overly ponderous	&quot;Imaginary Magnitude&quot;'s value as entertaining literature is essentially nil. Only occasionally does it lapse into readability - otherwise it is an undiluted philosophical treatise. To be sure, this is Lem at his most intellectual - it just doesn't lend the writing the same measure of livelihood his more straightforward pieces do. The format is quite something conceptually - a set of introductions to not-yet-written books. &quot;Imaginary Magnitude&quot; showcases four - plus &quot;GOLEM XIV&quot;, which, being a separate piece of literature altogether, is included only for the sake of its similar spirit.<br />The short pieces themselves aren't particularly exciting. This is Lem's chance to preach his views, and he does so extensively. &quot;Necrobes&quot; piqued my interest with its laconic treatment of creatively-posed x-ray nudes as art. &quot;Eruntics&quot; was even partially plausible - it deals with evolving a genome which is, basically, word-processing software. And then the bateria begin predicting the future. The &quot;Extelopedia&quot; lacked any sort of real structure - it is an encyclopedic dictionary of purely prognosticated words. The introduction includes a &quot;Proffertinc&quot; - a prognosticated offer, and a sample page of words that begin with &quot;prog-&quot;. The following introduction to a treatise on bitic literature - that is, books written by non-human authors - is an excellent piece of short fiction dealing with epistemological topics. The summary traces the development of artificial thinkers through several stages - from cladogenesis, where computers generate random meaningless words, through mimesis, where a computer formulates the mathematical basis of books, allowing perfect translations, and even creating entirely new works in the author's exact style, and to transhuman apostasy - works generally incoprehensible to humans - from incredibly complicated math to elaborate works on cosmogony.<br />Then the reader gets to &quot;GOLEM XIV&quot;, and the book takes a nosedive. Even despite the warning, the superhuman, impersonal intelligence within the computer seems snobbish, patronizing, and the text of its lectures - overly elaborate and peppered with metaphors. Likewise, the leading points of the two lectures - on man and on itself - coincide: the evolution is an asymptotic blunder; it has reached the maximum level of complication in its creations, and further random &quot;progress&quot; is impossible; man has reached his potential ceiling and is drowning in his civilization, etc. Like most of Lem, taken piece by piece this is profound theorizing, but as a work of creative, non-academic literature it is ornate and unreadable.	2001-04-07

A Wizard of Earthsea was about identity. Tombs of Atuan was about liberty. The Farthest Shore is the most philosophical, and probably the hardest to stomach of the three. It is about destiny.<br />Things go sour in Earthsea. Colors aren't quite as vivid as before, and life has lost its crisp edge. Dark, envious thoughts brew in the minds of men. Melody, beauty, magic are all vanishing - the True Speech no longer rings true, and singers stop in mid-word, for their songs become meaningless. And all because a man of dark ambition has crippled the Equilibrium - making life and death as one, unleashing Undeath upon the world...<br />Unlike the two previous books, &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; has a viewpoint character - untried Prince Arren, who accompinies an aging Sparrowhawk on his long journey to find the root of evil. LeGuin does this in order to draw a sharp contrast between the noble Archmage and the mad people - though at times it is irritating to wait for Ged to repeat everything he says in wizardspeak in a tongue Arren can understand. Through Ged, Le Guin formulates her philosophy in much clearer and heavy-handed fashion than she does in previous volumes. Overall, she seems to lean towards a transcendentalist policy, advocating contemplation in favor of action, and seeing man as a mere component of the grand scheme of life. While the reader may feel uncomfortable with LeGuin's blatant didactics, the book quickly acquires a great emotional value as it becomes obvious that Ged won't be able to eradicate the threat easily.<br />I would like to agree with the previous reviewers that some scenes in the book are written in a fashion that is both vague and awkward: among these is the trance scene in Hort Town and Sopli's drowning, which I had to read several times in order to actually understand what happened. Nevertheless, most of the book is lucidly written and the narrative flows very well. The villain is clearly not central to the author's message, and the heroes' meeting with him is anticlimactic. Similarly, the actual climax is not up to par with the rest of the book.<br />&quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; provides a grand finish to Ged's saga, though LeGuin did re-open the setting later to write a fourth book. Excellent, profound reading.	2001-04-04

James Lowry, Atworthy's Professor of Ethnology, is paying dearly for having written a scathing article about witchcraft. First of all, he is dishonorably discharged from the college for writing such demagoguery. Then he loses four hours - with no recollections whatever. Worst of all, the entire realm of the supernatural is out to prove him wrong...<br />Fear is devastatingly boring. It introduces its hero, catch, and premise in the first twenty pages or so, then hems and haws for about a hundred with no plot development whatever while the unfortunate Prof. Lowry has episodic run-ins with the supernatural, finally gets a bit interesting in its final thirty pages by introducing some fairly original concepts, and then ends as abruptly as possible by putting everything on its head and cutting it down with a big rusty axe. Its Final Twist feels contrived, if crudely ironic.<br />&quot;Fear&quot; is terribly dated and its characters are cardboard-flat. Its protagonist is a perfectly upright fellow, logical, caring, with an academic background to boot: in other words - hard to identify with. &quot;Fear&quot; doesn't even have a defined antagonist. The story consists of a single catch which is revealed in its entirety on the very last page - for the remainder of the book Lowry jumps at shadows, shivers in the dark, sees strange things, and slowly goes mad (though, being so shallow in the first place, he doesn't have much of a personality to warp). Supposedly, he is out to find the four missing hours, but he has neither clues nor leads, nor any faint, sinister memories - he literally goes out at night and &quot;looks&quot; for his loss. The narrative lacks sophistication, and uses lots of exclamation marks and eye-grabbing sentences (&quot;It was an inch deep in blood!&quot;).<br />Hardly worth the while to read.	2001-03-28

Next to no running themes from &quot;A Mirror of Her Dreams&quot; survived the transition into this volume: the viewpoint shifts out of the castle, the narrative loses its air of eldritch mystery, all villains are made known, all plans are revealed, and Terisa abandons the last remnants of her passivity.<br />The level of characterisation, the engagingly sophisticated conversations of the previous volume are gone. The relationship between Terisa and Geraden is now clearly marked as love, and their touching conversations slur into monotonous sarcasm and an excess of sex (&quot;She would have killed for a pillow under her hips...&quot;). Similarly, by now the readers already know what King Joyse is doing, what Eremis' plans are, who is in league with whom and what they're planning to do. Lebbick emerges as the most interesting character, but he serves no purpose in the plot save for his novelty.<br />For the first three hundred pages, Geraden and Terisa are riding around Mordant for no reason but to make the book longer. Donaldson flirts with some elements of horror - his ghouls are definitely chilling - but that is hardly enough to capture the reader long-term. The entire second half of the book is a protracted showdown between two armies. Almost every character from both books makes a return on one of the sides, making the battle seem like a reunion of sorts. The climax itself is considerably shorter, lasting some fifty pages. It seems contrived and depends largely on a string of coincidences.<br />Worst of all, the book ends without tackling its most interesting aspect - Imagery. Indeed, Donaldson doesn't give the reader a glimpse of more than ten or so mirrors. The characters don't get to visit alternate worlds - save for a short bit in Terisa's apartment. Furthermore, there is no hint of explanation of either Geraden's or Terisa's wild talents, which make most of the plot possible.<br />This finale of a long fantasy novel is sadly lacking.	2001-03-28

His art is comparable to Eggleton's in terms of luster, but is far more detailed, defined, spacious. <br />Mr. Burns is almost excusively a science fiction artist, but he is not above doing fantasy. Included are the magnificent cover for Silverberg's &quot;Lord Prestimion&quot; and the covers for Duncan's &quot;A Handful of Men&quot; tetralogy, to mention a few. In any case, Mr. Burns seems to derive more inspiration from science fiction than fantasy - his sci-fi paintings just seem more alive. He is notorious for keeping to the letter of the subject material, and thus his artwork is full of detail. On a different note, I enjoyed the captions - written by Mr. Burns himself: they sparkle with wit and personality.<br />A few paintings - this is especially evident in some of the humans - do suffer from minor parallax problems: just observe the case of minor cross-eye in the finger-knitting heroine on the cover, or, alternatively, the similar figure on the painting for Bear's &quot;/&quot; (&quot;Slant&quot;, not &quot;Slash&quot;). Otherwise, this is an indispensable book for lovers of fantastic art.	2001-03-24
US	50899460	R2H13CAKCQBGDP	0380793326	678851862	The Physiognomy	Books	3	6	9	N	N	Falls short of expectations.	Don't believe anyone who says that &quot;The Physiognomy&quot; is irresistibly entertaining. For the first seventy or so pages (a good portion of this 200-page book) I had to resist the urge to toss this of Jeffrey Ford's creations across the room. The viewpoint character, one Physiognomist Cley, is a tough pill to swallow from page one: he believes himself the very crown of creation, and harbors a deep loathing for everyone else; he literally has to supress the urge to punch his partners in conversation; he is a notorious drug addict, and has protracted hallucinations every few pages; at night, he dreams of kicking people in the seat of the pants. The lugubrious arrogance and aloof cynicism of his narration instantly kills any pretense of fun.<br />For a good while it seems that Mr. Ford's only gift is that for surprisingly original juxtapositions, with virtually no substance connecting them. The novel's setting can be loosely termed as &quot;steampunk&quot;; the reader relishes in the well realized originality of the semi-divine Drachton Below and his toy metropolis, his perverse clockwork zombies, the outlying forests filled with all sorts of Bosch demons, and the tiny frontier villages filled with slowly calcifying miners. Unfortunately, there is little or nothing connecting this imagery, and the entire novel has an unrealistic, dream-like quality to it: Ford's sulfur mines hardly seem like such a horrible place (despite the fumes, Cley doesn't seem to develop TB, and at night he relaxes in a pleasant cottage with a monkey butler), and the bulk of his characters seem to be automata. For a while I hoped that the emerging metaphysical elements would connect into a unified whole by the end, lending the book a somewhat lasting impression. I ever built up an entire scheme of cyclicity and time loops which seems to fit the novel quite well, but, no, I was wrong: the novel ends without resolving many of the reader's questions, focusing on the prosaic matters instead. <br />Mr. Ford's &quot;The Physiognomy&quot; sorely lacks a definite mythos. It fails miserably as a novel about characters, and doesn't have enough to make it a novel about ideals.	2001-03-24

And, indeed, this milder, more verbose variation on &quot;Ender's Game&quot; would feel right at home in a galaxy far, far away. There is absolutely no science involved here. The dull, unimaginative aliens include dog-men, snake-men, bee-men, emotionless, mechanical men, and blue-skinned men. Apparently, all planets in the galaxy share a Mediterranian climate and atmosphere, and any alien can survive on a diet of foreign food.<br />Yes, this book deals with personal freedoms, censorship, and same-sex love, but it deals with those subjects in a shallow, inadequate way. The good is a bit too good, and the evil, instead of being ambiguous, is definitely, outrageously evil. Even the book's centerpiece same-sex (but different species) romance is contrived and artificial. Ms. Waitman seems convinced that the success of such relationships lies in two things: constant mutual gratification and a knack for femininity.<br />&quot;The Merro Tree&quot; is about the blossoming talent of a young prodigy, told in parallel with our now-aged hero's struggle against a galactic ban on his unique art. An entertaining concept, certainly. But the characters are almost entirely two-dimensional and the prose tends to be flowery and melodramatic. Mikk is not entertaining in his role as the main character. As the book starts out, his personality seems shifting and impermanent. For a good deal of time, his young aspect is shy and clumsy, but that goes away within several pages with little or no explanation. Which is really a pity, since two-thirds of the way in, Ms. Waitman wakes up and takes advantage of the reader's pent-up jealousy for Mikk's apparently inborn talents. Soon, she starts pulling on other strings, and the book gains a surprisingly effective amount of drama and pathos, but nevertheless manages to end on a flat and mystifying note.<br/>Ms. Waitman has definite talent. Unfortunately, her characters in &quot;The Merro Tree&quot; take a great deal of time to take shape, and most of the dialog is either stunted or predictable. In her next work, &quot;The Divided&quot;, Ms. Waitman fixes some of her errors, but some are still there. Watch for her upcoming works.	2001-03-21

Moorcock is heavily, perhaps not without reason, biased toward maturity, wit, complexity, and literary passion. He ridicules the idyllic, pro-status quo Tolkien and his followers: he compares his &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; to Miln's &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot;, and accuses it of blatant stupefaction - &quot;let's forget all our troubles and go to sleep&quot;. He also openly criticizes Lewis' &quot;Narnia Chronicles&quot; for overly obvious ideology. He shoots down any author who &quot;writes down&quot; to his readers - adults or children. He also dislikes imitators, dull narration, poor vocabularies, and a great deal of other things, which is precisely what makes this book such an attention grabber.<br />Moorcock divides his book into several chapters - dealing separately with settings, heroes, humor, etc. If nothing else, &quot;Wizardry and Wild Romance&quot; provides an excellent grounding in the obscure classics of fantasy - but Moorcocks's disjointed narrative proves to be both thoughtful and thought-inspiring. He leaves a great deal of room for statements on tone, richness of vision, characters. He also quotes extensively from the books he is talking about. Quite literally he leaves no stone unturned - all sorts of fantasy falls under discussion: children's, Burroughs, Kipling, Lovecraft, and many others. Lastly, there is even a nice introductory list of places to look for further information. <br />Moorcock viciously shook my preconceptions and tastes in fantasy, constantly leaving me unbalanced and on my toes. This book of bombastic discussions represents a valuable addition to any collection.	2001-03-18

As the Congress opens the floor, a revolution erupts outside. There are a few humorous moments, such as Ijon writhing in the throes of universal love brought about by the chemicals in the tap water, and his occasional run-ins with the representatives of the Liberated Publishing Groups, who advocate total debauchery and fulfillment of bodily urges. Soon it becomes apparent that the revolution is being suppressed by chemical means - the government floods the streets with pacifying gases that cause violent altruism and a deep sense of guilt - and all hell breaks loose.<br />In the resulting chaos Ijon slips in and out of the real world, totally unsure of its reality - the gas takes its toll on everyone. Soon the reality appears to solidify and he is told that he was earlier nearly destroyed, frozen, and reanimated in the future, in the year 2039. The entire world is an idyll. Knowledge, oblivion, and any emotion can be induced chemically. One can literally go into a bank and take out a free loan for any sum of money - only to be chemically compelled to repay it eventually. But soon deep suspicions rise in Ijon, who is totally alienated from this futuristic, robotic utopia. For example, why is everyone constantly panting? And then he discovers the terrifying truth. <br />&quot;The Futurological Congress&quot; pulls off the Matrix's premise with startling potency - Lem has no need for rebelling robots - this apparent hell is humanity's last refuge from extinction. So the next time you ride your car to work, think: are you really riding, or is the sensation merely generated by a chemical? Maybe you're not riding, but merely jogging along? Or perhaps even that is an illusion? Perhaps your rotting body is lying in a snowdrift alongside a road, pathetically wriggling its skeletal legs in a pretense of jogging, its heart beating in a plastic box of red-and-blue plasma? Or is even that a mirage, masking an even more horrifying truth?	2001-03-18

Like most Lem's works, &quot;Memoirs Found in a Bathtub&quot; defies ready classification. It is hardly a work of science fiction, unless you consider the inexhaustible amount of office supplies the Building goes through in the course of the novel. It makes do with but a rudiment of plot. And, of course, it is absolutely brilliant.<br />&quot;Pentagon 3&quot; is a concrete bullet stuck in the teeth of the Rockies. Walled off from the rest of the world by three miles of rock, it served as civilized mankind's last refuge in the face of an alien paper-devouring agent that has reduced the global culture of the twentieth century to embers. &quot;Pentagon 3&quot; existed for seventy-two years until a slight shift in the volcanic strata burst its cement envelope and flooded the innards with magma, preserving building's contents for posterity. A millennium later, this derelict is excavated and explored. One of the more interesting finds happens to be an almost perfectly preserved wad of a substance called &quot;papyr&quot;, which apparently served for recording data. &quot;Memoirs Found in a Bathtub&quot; is the perfect transcript of these ancient texts, humanity's only glance into the heart of a bygone age.<br />The Building is a mysterious realm of double, triple, and quadruple agents, unmaskings and concealed microphones, infinitely meaningless passwords and rows of identical offices, containing no less identical secretaries. Here, everyone speaks in code, and every bit of sewage is hand-sifted in corresponding facilities. Don't be surprised to find metallic flies floating in your coffee: they're just trying to distract you from noticing the less obvious devices. What is the building's modus operandi? Has this ultimate Bureaucracy resorted to chaos, hoping that if documents circulate randomly, they will eventually reach the intended hands? Or is the Building completely and entirely infiltrated by the Antibuilding agents - and vice versa - so that everyone knows everything but has no one to tell? Or is there no Antibuilding at all? And what is our hero's Secret Mission?<br />&quot;Memoirs&quot; is completely and entirely applicable to every aspect of life. It edifies and puzzles, brims with revelations and never fails to surprise. It is full of bitter cynicism and unmasked sarcasm. It is funny and bewildering. It must be read.	2001-03-10

I wholeheartedly enjoy Lem, have done so since childhood (which is when I originally read &quot;The Cyberiad&quot;). It is essentially a collection of stories that are, well, fairy tales with robots instead of humans. We have the same kingdoms, kings, princes, and princesses, sinister advisers and ingenious alchemists and mechanics, who, being robots, can also pull off any trick that pulp fiction has to offer: here empires span constellations, characters cook up outrageous devices at will, and galaxies hang in the sky only to spin in the wake of our plucky hero's rocketship. This all serves to engender an atmosphere incredibly conducive to all sorts of wit, sarcasm, criticism, parody, and bombast, which is precisely the end towards which Lem works very diligently. Indeed, taken bit by bit, idea by idea, Cyberiad is full of zero-magnitude stellar gems: &quot;Once, a terribly important war never got declared, and all because the King, decked in spangles and crystal pendants, hung three days from the ceiling and passed for a chandelier, holding his mouth to keep from laughing out loud at the ministers rushing about frantically below.&quot; Hilarious, isn't it?<br />But something happened between my two readings of this wonderful epic. Yes, I previously read this in the original, but whoever translated this did a terrific job: even Klapaucius' &quot;poem about a haircut... lofty, noble, tragic, timeless, full of love, treachery, retribution, quiet heroism in the face of certain doom... six lines, cleverly rhymed, and every word beginning with the letter s&quot; is faithfully translated, though it forces the English language to bend over backwards trying to accomodate its requirements. But, somehow, between waves of nonsense, pseudo-sci-fi terms, and downpours of Latin phrases and statements, I came away almost yawning. Perhaps it's the abridgement: I remember the original being much larger; here, for example, only the stories involving Trurl and Klapaucius, a duo of inventors, are included. I am at a loss to find anything else at fault. Just... don't start with excessively high expectation.	2001-03-07
US	50899460	R2FI7LI0C6H0VZ	0345414373	302366672	The Divided	Books	3	3	6	N	N	A long story of how people suddenly get sick of war	The Maurkheti and the Tel-Mari have been at war as long as anyone remembers, with the mysterious, aloof notion of &quot;peace&quot; only hinted at in ancient chronicles. The war continues for no perceptible reason short of religious zeal and the fact that cheap Tel-Mari labor profits the industrial nation of Maurkhet. But decadence and a tradition of bloodshed is fertile ground for seeds of radical change that is about to take on unheard-of forms...<br />Here we find a work of scifantasy that is innocuous and straightforward, whose characters rarely speak out more than two or three at a time, always speak as equals, say what they are expected to say, and ALWAYS keep an open mind. It is no wonder that the human interactions in the permanently wartorn world of &quot;The Divided&quot; seem artificial, contrived, and rather predictable. Nevertheless, the prose is quick-moving and descriptive. The book maintains readability throughout and consistently captures the reader's attention, if not imagination or some other faculty. Ms. Waitman clearly has yet to discover a great deal of her considerable literary talent.<br />In all honesty, this is the only work of fiction where you likely to find passages like &quot;Excuse me, Captain, but I suddenly have a terrible headache and must lie down&quot;. As you might have realized, the speaker of this line is the Emperor of a nation of zealots. To all appearances, he has no guards save one, his palace, though it is a titanic gold-sheathed dome on the outside, appears to be a simplified royal hovel, and one needs to follow no specific rules of conduct when addressing him. Character development is frequently as light and unrealistic. Even the ending, despite its vibrant messages of peace and reconciliation, answers few questions and is antithetical to the novel's apparent premise. The jo are never adequately explained, masses of war-tired soldiers break down all too quickly, and the line between good and evil is too sharply drawn andobvious. This is hardly a worthwhile pick from a sea of good literature.	2001-03-07

Treachery hangs in the air like a heavy mist. And, worst of all, Mordant's senile King seems to be consciously working toward the ruin of the kingdom he himself cobbled together from a handful of burnt-over duchies...<br />We all knew it would happen sooner or later: Mr. Donaldson launched yet another hapless mortal into a magical world. This time his victim is Terisa Morgan, a wisp of a woman who, having grown up in an abusive household, lacks any self-confidence whatsoever. She is literally petrified with indecisiveness at every step, unless she follows a pointless day-to-day routine that promises an uneventful journey straight into the grave. Worst of all, she relies on mirrors to confirm her very existence. Oh, and she's remarkably easy to seduce.<br />Thus, we have two themes running alongside in this first part of a huge fantasy/mystery novel: the gathering stormclouds around the castle of Orison (which serves as the King's stronghold), and Teresa's slow quest to abandon her passivity. There are several things wrong with this: what Terisa loses in passivity, she hardly gains in any other area - as the book speeds towards the cliffhanger ending, she becomes flatter and flatter; nevertheless, even in an active state, logic seems to cost her a great deal: Donaldson sets up one of the characters as ruthless and evil, but Teresa is too busy having a sort of confused romance with him to pry any deeper.<br />The accumulating mystery is nothing short of gripping. Unfortunately, it goes on with hardly any resolution for six-and-a-half hundred pages, five hundred of which Terisa spends in two states: she is either sitting passively in her room, or is dragged about Orison by some character or another. I can only hope that all the resolution takes place in the second volume of Mordant's Need, otherwise help me God.<br />Theword imagery is certainly vivid. Not even the fact that the entire book takes place in a single castle, and that this fantasy world has hardly any fantasy elements besides the art of conjuring things by producing them out of mirrors reflects on the quality of the writing. The characters are certainly deep and convincing, despite the genre's usual trends. Nevertheless, I felt a certain sense of dissatisfaction, as if the characters tired me, however complex they were.<br />Is this an excellent read? Certainly. Can I guarantee that you will enjoy reading about a mounting mystery for six hundred pages straight, only to have to look for the second volume? Absolutely not.<br />But it certainly looks impressive in hardcover...	2001-02-28

It is essentially a sequel to &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot;, detailing the events that happened after Battle School was disbanded, the Formic War won, and the children sent home to rest on their laurels. It isn't even about Peter - he is dealt with in two chapters throughout the book - once when Bean meets him face to face, and at the very end, when he auspiciously rises to the lofty position of Hegemon.<br />What &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; actually deals with is Achilles' struggle for world domination, and Bean's campaign to stop him. Unfortunately, since neither any longer relies on pure wits, but rather falls back on extensive connections and the military prowess of armies, the book simply ends up being a cheap political thriller. Few new characters are introduced, and the recurrent ones hardly have changed since the preceding pair of parallel novels. In addition, for a novel that takes place all over the globe, there is barely any sensation of change. The quality of characterization certainly fell since the previous book - I was at a loss to distinguish the characters one from another; they are all mere conveyances for whatever piece of philosophy Card is trying to put in. Even the resolution is quaint: though Peter assumes his post (no thanks to Bean), the Hegemon hardly has any discretion at all - it will take a sequel to show how Peter changes from a figurehead to a virtual emperor. Even the dastadly villain - Achilles - isn't dealt with with any measure of finality at the novel's end.<br />Without a doubt, this is the worst entry in Ender's long-running saga so far.	2001-02-21

Neither is perfect for humans - on Genji they must wear pressure suits in addition to getting used to gravity levels half-again as high as on Earth; Chujo is more forgiving, though it can be intensely cold. Both planets serve home to sapient races: the Ihrdizu of Genji - low-tech amphibians that congregate in small villages; and the humanoids of Chujo - aloof, mysterious beings that ignore the humans entirely. It is here that the first manned interstellar expeditions will arrive, bearing humans of all frames of mind - Earthlings and off-worlders, atheists and philosophers, mystics and iconoclasts...<br />Instead of being a collaborative novel, &quot;Murasaki&quot; is a mixed bag of science fiction stories that share a setting, each written by a different award-winning author. Mind the fact that the only interesting part is the fairly in-depth world-creation notes (included as appendices), and that the stories are pathetically shallow and lead virtually nowhere...<br />...That is precisely what I though about this &quot;science fiction novel in six parts&quot; prior to reading the last two parts, which are so refreshingly, profoundly excellent that I almost wept with awe. A mystery of interplanetary proportions is suddenly built up and then revealed in flying colors.<br />It's really a pity that the rest of Murasaki doesn't follow suit.	2001-02-21

Ghosts of ancestors quip their picture frames, and ghostly spectres of armored titans are rumoured to be seen. When, in spite of these ill omens, Manfred insists that Isabella wed him in stead, by force if necessary, it becomes clear that some ulterior motives are at play, for a mere mortal is trying to outwit an ancient prophecy...<br />The chief appeal of &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; is that it's genuinely old. So old, in fact, that when it was written, it was read for the sake of the plot rather then the gothic ambiance. If you try to take it for a historical horror novel, you will be bored to tears by the slow, contrived plot, archaic language, and unrealistic characters. But if you factor in its age and radically differet approach (not many books like it are written now), you can't help but be at least intrigued. In essence, this is a Shakespearean play in novel form: it has love triangles, valiant heroes, revenge from beyond the grave, fair maidens, virtuous priests, etc. If you have a penchant for this sort of book, I'm sure you will have a super time.	2001-02-21
US	50899460	R2NL8YNS2TBO91	0441000681	769194143	Neuromancer	Books	5	7	10	N	N	Mind-altering	To make you understand what I went through while reading Neuromancer, I'd like to say that this is the first book that I've ever read that warrants over-the-top gore. Excessive profanity. Drugs. Sex. It is as much a discourse on alternate forms of conscience as it is a high-power sci-fi thriller.<br />What's cyberpunk? Take turn-of-the-twentieth-century New York, filled with pollution, congestion, crime, and vermin, and fast-forward it into the computer age. Everything is possible. Everyone is dispensable. Drugs, weapons, women - it just takes the money, or the wits. And the everpresent Matrix - a virtual reality spanning the globe, a phantasmagorical ocean of information that has its own share of sailors.<br />Case thought that he could outwit his employer. For this he was robbed of his online talents, his very nerves singed with a potent micotoxin. Now it is only a matter of time before he unwittingly falls prey to suicidal depression. Suddenly he is proposed an offer: to have his nerves resoted if he is willing to participate in a very odd mission, one that will involve teaming up with a razor-handed assassin with a fresh outlook on life, a perverse freak who can subliminally induce hallucinations, all under command of a catatonic schizoid - a man whose personality is a shallow facade constructed to mask the fact that his soul is forever trapped living and re-living a horrid disaster. The goal? Write a new page in the history of mankind. By all means, Neuromancer is unique. The prose is concentrated, terse and powerful. Gibson's talent is allowing the reader to experience the psychological climate - and, believe me, there is a good deal of disturbing stuff in here. This poignant investigation of human nature is a definite, superb must-read.	2001-02-17
US	50899460	R1EAU0A6Q07PJ4	0810117320	957846063	Memoirs of a Space Traveler: Further Reminiscences of Ijon Tichy	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Should've been combined with the &quot;Diaries&quot;	For the love of all that is decent, I don't know why &quot;Further Reminiscences&quot; hasn't been combined with &quot;The Star Diaries&quot; to make one handy volume. First of all, thdestinction is essentially artificial - &quot;Further Reminiscences&quot; contains two journeys which were dropped, for one reason or another, from the American edition of the Diaries, a selection of Earthside &quot;reminiscences&quot;, a short called &quot;Doctor Diagoras&quot;, and the fantastic &quot;Let Us Save the Universe&quot;, all of which were present in the original Polish edition. Even the books' sizes favor an omnibus re-issue (250 and 150 pages, respectively). <br />The two &quot;new&quot; journies found in this book are the eighteenth and the twenty-eighth. The 18th is essentially a shorter, more readable version of the 20th (found in the parent volume), and the classic, oft-reprinted 28th deals with personal freedoms (the Phools and the Master Machine that was created to mediate their conflicts - and thus decides to refabricate them in stone to stop their chaotic quarrels).<br />The five &quot;further reminiscences&quot; are essentially humorless essays, each dealing with a specific philosophical idea. In each, Tichy comes into contact with some sort of scientific visionary (be it Corcoran, Decantor, Zazul, or Molteris), and, after ascertaining that they aren't insane, listens to their wild stories: Corcoran constructs mechanical brains whose lives and fate are mere recordings in a large steel drum; Decantor wants to immortalize the soul by encasing it in crystal; Zazul tells the gruesome story of his attempt to clone himself; Molteris produces a functional time machine, and, without examining the possible consequences, tests it on himself. It is apparent that these were written at the same time as the journeys, since the 20th has a direct reference to Molteris. &quot;Doctor Diagoras&quot; is not a certified &quot;reminiscence&quot;, although it is essentially identicalin spirit, the topic of debate being artificial intelligence (the fifth reminiscence is very similar to the 11th journey, only in reverse and with more legal issues).<br />The volume closes with &quot;Let Us Save the Universe&quot;, which is a detailed petition to conserve intergalactic flora and fauna, with several quite hilarious examples of how we foul up the planets, and how some species manage to retaliate.<br />In a nutshell? A worthwhile read - far from a worthwhile purchase.	2001-02-17
US	50899460	R19BL1O3P25LGJ	0156849054	710522506	The Star Diaries	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Gulliver's Journeys in space	&quot;The Star Diaries&quot; cannot be easily classified, probably because of its varied content. In any case, this isn't science fiction. This is philosophical satire, although it isn't clear what precisely it satirizes. The theme isn't consistent. The book is intended as a recollection of a spacefarer's unbelievable journeys, with each story being a separate adventure. Each is numbered, but the enumeration contains gaps, and, in any case, the numerical order isn't the chronological (the chronological order is 22, 23, 25, 11, 12, 13, 14, 7, 8, 28, 20, 21).<br />If one does read the stories in the chronological order, a certain evolution becomes clear: the earlier stories are light-hearted social satire with Ijon Tichy as the book's extremely close-minded but nevertheless courteous and polite hero romping about on alien planets (&quot;Due to the retardation of the passage of time, my sneeze lasted five days and five nights, and when Tarantoga again opened the little door, he found me nearly unconscious with exhaustion&quot;, 12th Journey); but with each new journey the reader is bound to notice that the backgrounds begin to become more and more Earthlike, the cheerful pseudo-sci-fi camouflage is dropped, and Ijon himself becomes a convention designed to deliver the plot's message. Some of these later journeys begin to drag quite impressively (20 bored me to tears - especially when I realized that it's a direct copy of a shorter story in the &quot;Further Reminiscences&quot;), but from time to time deliver an incredibly potent message (13 and 21 being the most prominent examples - both dealing with personal freedoms).<br />Of the earlier romps, 7 (a multiple time loop causes Ijon to live and re-live every part in a scandal over who should go and repair the rudder), 12 (Ijon is stranded on Amauropia with a time machine, and, by speeding up the evolution of a race of local cave people, is forced to live through all the tribulation a tribe, a feudal kingdom, a theocracy, a Republic, and a militaristic regime can offer), and 14 (Ijon tours a planet whose high-tech amoeboid natives have a titanic taboo centered about the concept of &quot;scrupts&quot;) seem to be the most fun.<br />The faults? As I mentioned, some of the later stories drag quite a bit, especially when the reader isn't prepared for a lesson in philosophy. Those looking for &quot;Hitchhiker's Guide&quot; sort of fiction will only be able to stomach about half the book. From time to time, Lem slips into writing entirely in and about fictional (read - &quot;nonsensical&quot;) things. Of course, not all the nonsense is really non-sense: Lem relied on plays of words and puns for some of the humor, and most was probably lost in the translation (I was lucky to read it in the next best thing to the original Polish - Ukrainian).<br /> Nevertheless, this is a startling, mind-bending, and superbly original read which should not be missed.	2001-02-14

Janie Crawford-Killicks-Logan-Woods is almost impossibly dull and unrealistic in her role as the lead heroine. Being a young (but progressively older) black woman in the rural turn-of-the-century South she seems to have the mobility of a Harrier jet. She marries with little or no consideration, walks out on marriages, and seems unimpeded by either long-distance train fare, Jack Crow laws, or, for that matter, the conventions of standard English.<br />Janie's quest is one for identity, although, being as witless as she is, she constantly gets caught up in deceptive romances that quickly turn into abusive relationships. This tale would be tragic were the heroine anyone but Janie. As it is, it leaves the reader hoping.<br />The writing? In a word: florid. Hurston's prose is purple to the point of being ultraviolet. The narrative is peppered with discussions on the nature of mankind, the humanity of various characters, and how everything is for the best, but eventually the reader begins to notice that everything that happens in &quot;Their Eyes&quot; is due to acts of God. Deaths by kidney failure. Lucrative strangers proposing marriage. Floods and hurricanes. Rabies. By the end of the book, I was watching God myself, hoping that the next disaster to strike would at least propel the story by killing off a tired, depleted character.<br />Frankly, I cannot see why &quot;Their Eyes&quot; is touted as a leading classic of black literature. Perhaps I am not part of its target audience, perhaps I am not in the mood for clumsy, didactic fables, perhaps I am misunderstanding something, but in the end, with everything said and done (I even read the original critics' reviews and the afterword!), I felt completely and utterly indifferent...	2001-02-10

Rather than creating a powerfully imagined world, or thinking up some unheard-of novelty, &quot;Tombs of Atuan&quot; is an attempt to tell an inspiring story in as few words and characters as possible. Brilliance and originality are by-products.<br />The second book set on Earthsea, Tombs focuses on a small part of the Kargad archipelago, home to a belligerent nation of fair-skinned people under the theocratic rule of a Godking. Two endemic religions exist here: popular worship of the Godking, and the forgotten, obsolete worship of the Nameless ones, evil cthonic spirits that are not gods. This is the tale of Tenar, a girl chosen at the age of five to be the &quot;reincarnated&quot; form of Arkha, the head priestess of the Nameless Ones, and Ged, who, having been trapped in the Nameless Ones' lightless labyrinth in search of a magical treasure, freed her from the lie she was living.<br />In all sincerity, &quot;Tombs of Atuan&quot; cannot be seriously called a novel. It is a novelette, or perhaps a novella. It is two sittings - about 150 pages - long. The writing is terse, descriptive, and powerful. Le Guin masterfully shows us the tiny religious compound in the middle of a wasteland, a dilapidated temple with a small earthen labyrinth beneath, the worshippers' disbelief and the multitude of pointless rituals surrounding the adoration of these bloodthirsty beings, and then hints that there is more than the eye can see, that neither the believers nor the unbelievers are entirely correct.<br />Every room, every twisting corridor becomes infused with the weight of countless souls, the implied power and urgency ringing in the air, and sinister majesty radiating from the Undertomb, a cavernous room no human eye was meant to see.<br />This is THE classic fantasy to read.Period.	2001-02-10

From the looks of it, a supernatural invasion is massing on the Northern border, someone cripples the Starks' young son, and there is unrest in the corrupt government (is the evil queen plotting to usurp the throne?). Suddenly, they are all swept up in a flurry of events that will determine the fate of the Seven Kingdoms for years to come.<br />Enter George R. R. Martin's medieval saga of generally unlikable people as they suffer the actions of even more awful, unsympathetic characters. Because, in effect, Matin's effort to darken everything led precisely to this: in this entire pseudo-historical epic there are virtually no characters I could identify with. I had another qualm with &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;: the characters seem to have next to no agenda: even in omniscient third-person mode, they don't seem to have any specific goals. Not only is this not a quest in the sense of the word - there is barely any foreshadowing. Because of this, there is no plot to speak of. Only the characters' reactions to the various happenings.<br />The only thing the reader will get out of this thick, eight-hundred-page book is pathos and heartache. Martin's world is so unbelievably filthy and gritty, the characters don't seem to stand a chance. A pinprick would give them terminal gangrene. The pages are peppered with scenes along the lines of: &quot;Across the road, a girl no older than Dany was sobbing in a high thin voice as a rider shoved her over a pile of corpses facedown, and thrust himself inside her.&quot; The most disturbing part is that no one seems to care. Martin's fantasy world is staggeringly dull: the focus is on the seven perfectly medieval kingdoms, filled with endless farms and hinterland. Outside that, there is a generic Mongol culture, a generic Chinese culture, and so on.<br />The novel is told from the viewpoints of several different characters, for the different perspectives as much as for the fact that the action happens across the globe. Unfortunately, the author has a penchant for cliffhanger endings of each chapter: &quot;The direwolf trotted to him. &quot;Gods be good,&quot; Dywen muttered. &quot;That's a hand.&quot;<br />Why four stars? The writing is incredibly powerful. The disturbing parts are truuly disturbing. I would've liked less mention of intercourse and prostitution - if you set out to count them, you'll quickly run out of fingers and toes, but what can you do?

Renie and the others escape from the Patchwork Land and come into the labyrinthine House, seemingly a universe of itself; Orlando and Fredericks reach Abydos-That-Was, and survive a brush-in with the Gods. Lastly, Paul faces a disappointing setback at Ithaca (Penelope was a dud) and sets sail for Troy. At last, after two thousand pages of character development and dead-end subplots, all of the heroes meet at Priam's Walls and discuss their utter bewilderment. The third volume combines the journeys across Otherland of the second volume and the urgent plot development of the first, to no specific effect.<br />&quot;Mountain of Black Glass&quot;, the third volume of the Otherland saga, is the sort of book where the reader realizes that the plot does not move at all. I am in favor of large works, but everything present here could most likely be condensed, along with volume two, into a smaller book. I looked towards the lauded &quot;climax&quot; with great expectations of old secrets revealed and new ones posed. No dice. The Other's true nature, the missing children, Mr. Sellars and Ramsey's quest, Paul's mysterious mission, and Otherland's frightening realism all remain unexplained. What the reader gets is a mystifying glimpse of the Other's online representation and a chaotic showdown. I enjoy enigmas, but not ones that lead seemingly nowhere (after all, what have our heroes accomplished so far?), and especially not ones that go on for two thousand pages. If Mr. Williams is planning to explain away the mysteries that baffled readers for many, many pages, he certainly is facing a Herculean task.	2001-01-17

I was a little surprised to find Ebert's writing slightly rough and disorganized. Bits of plot, comments on whether or not the actors fit the parts, and moments of amazing lucidity occur in the reviews in no specific order. Nevertheless, the conversational tone works and the reviews flow well. This guide to recent movies is as good as any, and probably better, since it includes reviews for movie festival entries, foreign films, and more. The guide also includes several indexes of movies and actors, and most (if not all) Answerman entries.<br />It isn't true that Roger Ebert is completely unbiased, and most of the entertainment (if any) derived from reading this installation in the yearly series will come from looking for his unique, personal stance on the art of moviemaking. Most action flicks, sordid teen dramas, dead-end forbidden romances, and a great many others are viciously shot down and trampled upon. On the other hand, fairly innocuous and endearing movies, especially if they are foreign-made, are gently supported like top-heavy saplings. Oh, and do watch out for Ebert's take on &quot;Pokemon: the Movie&quot;. It's absolutely hilarious.	2000-12-30

It is a large, heavy book that starts out by attempting to define the genre and follows by classifying fantasy into several sections (fantasy set in the past, far future, alternate Earths, lost worlds, etc.). Of course, this is all absolute nonsense. Nevertheless, the controlled, easygoing tone and the parallels drawn between works in the genre make this useful, even slightly enjoyable reading.<br />After the introduction there is one of the most important pages in the book: a listing of the works set in the mileaus described within, complete with authors. I have yet to see a more useful list of reading suggestions in the sub-genre of classic fantasy.<br />And, finally, the bulk of the pages is occupied by the sections on the settings themselves. Sections on Middle Earth, Atlantis, Lost Worlds, Peake's Gormenghast, Urth, Earthsea, Thomas Covenant's the Land, Moorcock's Elric, and Robert Howard's Conan stories, cover the setting's idealogy, works of literature set in these mileaus, the author's mindset, and detail the chief events outlining these settings. Accompanying illustrations seek to further elucidate the settings. Oddly enough, several cornerstone settings are inexplicably absent (most noticeably, McCaffrey's Pern and Zelazny's Amber). <br />In a nutshell, these overviews are tepid invitations to enjoy the genre of fantasy. This book serves out its purpose well.	2000-12-30

Williams had the wisdom to make the virtual worlds of Otherland utterly disturbing - something to keep a jaded reader interested as he wades through a post-apocalyptic Oz, a titanic kitchen populated by condiments, and London after the Martians won the War of the Worlds.<br />The plotlines go as follows (no major spoilers): online, our heroes are split up and are forced to go through simulation after simulation looking for their comrades; Martine and company receive cryptic hints from someone involved with the project; Paul Jonas continues his journey, having finally remembered his identity, and clued in as to where he is; and, as you may remember from the end of the first book, Dread has sabotaged and occupied one of our heroes' sims. Offline, a pair of Australian cops follow the luke-warm trail of a sadistic murderer (Dread), and Sam's and Orlando's parents hire an investigator to look in to their odd case and whether it has any connection with a certain large megacorporation.<br />This second volume moves far slower than the first, but this didn't prevent it from being a page turner for me. I hope you enjoy it.	2000-12-26

I began reading &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot; with great expectations (a mistake?), but soon was bitterly disappointed. Since the book is some dozen times shorter than the work of literature it parodies, the text is a summary of LotR at best. Because of this underwhelming lack of structure, the writing moves clumsily. Although the authors were certainly successful in making fun of the characters' names, they made the mistake of making everything into a tasteless gag. The truly humorous parts are few and far between, and to get to them you must find your way past unfunny oxymorons, senseless one-liners, and odd, but certainly not entertaining descriptions. Sure it's worth a read- if you aren't afraid of poking fun at great literature, that is- but only the patient few will have the nerve to get through the lewd misadventures of these hapless, reptilian boggies.	2000-12-13

James McBride delivers an unimaginably unique slice of that pie in the form of this powerful, inspiring memoir. Ruth Shilsky/McBride/Jordan was an immigrant Hassidic Jew, who, having escaped the opressive bonds of her family and the wide-spread racism of the time, converted to the Christian faith, married a black man, brought up a dozen of children of mixed blood and put them through college.<br />McBride centers on his quest to understand his confused heritage, at a time when anti-white and anti-black sentiments ran high. The chapters alternate between James' own life and his mother's youth, which very effectively support each other. <br />There is no (and could not be) an organized plot. The chapters jump back and forth through time, sometimes reiterating and underscoring a message that was hidden previously. McBride uses his powerful, simple language to very good ends. A definite must-read.	2000-12-09

The morning sun is high enough to touch the uppermost fifty stories of Urban Monade 116. &quot;Good morning!&quot; says the screen heartily. &quot;The external temperature, if anyone's interested, is 28 degrees. Today's population figure at Urbmon 116 is 881,115, which is +102 since yesterday and +14,187 since the first of the year. God bless, but we're slowing down!&quot;<br />Every person of the 75,000,000,000 Earth Urbmon population lives with his/her parents until early puberty, at which point he/she is sent to the consummation halls with a pre-assigned life partner of approximately equal age. When they have their first child, the young couple moves to a sere flat on the floor the number of which reflects their social status. Here they will live out the rest of their perfectly happy lives, begetting a happy average of nine children, working at their dead-end careers (after all, if things were solved, what would there be left to do!?), and nightwalking into strangers' flats for more habitual intercourse. When they die, they will be sent for recycling down the tubes. On Earth of 2381, sex is as casual as shaking someone else's hand, and is encouraged by the muted social standards.<br />The book takes the format of interlinked chapter-like stories portraying various family units that can't quite live by the norm. Like the Quevedo family, who secretly feel like resurrecting the antediluvian concepts of vice and violence. Or Michael Statler, who breaks the supreme law of the Urbmon by escaping into the outside world, with which he is profoundly alienated. Or Siegmund Kluver, who, having risen to the very top at the tender age of fifteen, discovers the profound emptyness of it all.<br />Although very sexually explicit (after all, this is a future where intercourse is a perfectly acceptable aspect of society!), &quot;The World Inside&quot; provokes thought. Certainly, this work of science fiction is not to be missed.	2000-12-06

Without solidifying on a single plot and growing stale, the book smoothly flows between the refreshingly original settings:the foreseeably near future- a Virtual-Reality-literate South African Republic of mid-21st century, where a young university professor must unravel the hideous mystery of an elite virtual club that offers sensations- even to users without the equipment for it; as far as can be deduced, the grotesque establishment triggered coma in thousands of young children; the virtual fantasy world of Middle Country, where a pair of users suddenly discover something amiss, a subtle shift indicating an intrusion of a great power; a covert military base, where an unwitting girl visits a silly old man with strange eyes and many ferns around his house - a house he never leaves... is he a devious assassin for an online circle of the most powerful mysteriarchs on Earth? And the distant past of the foggy, chlorinated trenches of World War I, where a soldier finds his bleak front life interrupted by fleeting, semi-real dreams of something more believable than his nightmarish surroundings, until he flees into the shadows, away from his comrades who have become nightmares. And there is always Otherland, the great mystery.<br />Williams does a great job of engaging the reader with lively, descriptive language, the high originality of content, and chapters of manageable length. Whichever mileau the reader is currently in, he will be at a loss to sum it up with a single word. There are few enough main characters to develop them well and make them close to the reader- Renie, Orlando, and !Xabbu quickly become faces that can be summoned up on a moment's notice. Williams has a highly precise knowledge and understanding of the guiding forces behind history and man's behavior and emotions.  His future is quitebelievable (as well as the horror of his trenches, and the hollow feeling evoked by the castle in the clouds, and the high-powered arguments in the Abydos-That-Was). There are a few highly macabre scenes (luckily, not much blood-and-gore, Williams is well beyond that), but they fit the book's surreal atmosphere well.<br />Highly recommended reading, stylized, unique, and bridging several sub-genres. Do not miss this inspiring beginning of a quartet.	2000-11-29

In its hunger for pain and suffering, the Dactyl slowly gathers its evil throng, and finally erupts upon the unwary world in a titanic war of destruction. The reader follows the lives of the three heroes from adolescence through adulthood as they slowly realize that their goal is to warn (or, alternatively, save) the world. The one female and two male heroes are: Jylseponie (Jilly or Pony for short), a girl who loses her memory after her village is burned and ransacked by goblins; Elbryan (&quot;Nightbird&quot;) the Ranger, who, having witnessed the same carnage as Pony, is trained by the elves to become an ultimate warrior; and, finally, Avelyn Desbris, a young monk with phenomenal magic powers who loses faith and escapes with a trove of magic stones, having witnessed the ultimate corruption of his order.<br />To put it plainly, Salvatore seems to lack the sophistication to properly exploit the complicated themes he raises (lost faith, long-lasting trauma, wanderlust, alienation, captivity), and because of this flaw the most involving aspects of the plot become mundane very quickly. An viable alternative would be to flesh out the dark, somber world of the Demon Wars saga, but it is not pursued. His world retains the feeling of modernism and rarely allows the reader to &quot;immerse&quot; himself in the reading. The reader is left dangling between the Scylla of a fragmentary world and the Charybdis of characters that grow flatter as the book progresses.<br />Although generally quick-paced, the chapters are frequently interrupted by overlong, overdescribed skirmishes, where each individual stike and parry gets its own sentence. Since very little imagery is involved, the skirmishes quickly lose individuality.<br />A long, fairly average read, the first in a fairly long series.	2000-11-25

Arslan, a militarist from a tumultous backwater kingdom, conquered the world and destroyed civilization as we know it. M.J. Engh's &quot;Arslan&quot; is a true gem of speculative fiction. The central character, Arslan, is perhaps one of the most powerful, moving characters ever created: he is a force of unnerving, logical, yet passionate evil, yet he is incredibly human, even romantic. Arslan's goal is to save the world. From us. And yet he admittedly delights in the very hunt, the battle. He savors pain. He delights in perversion as much as he delights in learning. He shapes people's lives with his presence alone.<br />Using subtle, quick-moving language Engh paints a brilliant masterpiece that would require less masterful authors to use far more explicit scenes. It's sad that this excuciatingly powerful work of speculative political fiction (it takes place in an Illinois town in our time, and contains very few science fiction or fantasy elements) will not probably live to see a reprint.	2000-11-22

Or maybe it's just James Garner. Aside from a few interesting gags and factoids, the humour of this Y2K spoof is muddled and repetitive. The chapters cover literally everything from divination to prophecy to Y2K preparations (not to mention the significance of the year MM to McDonalds Corporation), but I couldn't bring myself to anything bigger than a quaint smile. <br />This book is not for the devout believers. Do notice than in Garner's dictionary, the words &quot;eschatological&quot; and &quot;scathological&quot; are separated only by a single syllable.	2000-11-22

Instead, the Reptile and Amphibian Problem Solver is a practical and readable reference for the beginner as well as an expert. A decent amount of space is allocated to selecting vivaria and substrates, creating an ambient atmosphere, and heating/lighting (although more information would be appreciated on the former, especially on the subject of keeping the vivarium cool, which is a constant challenge in the warmer climes). Reptile and amphibian care is listed separately. The entries are organized according to classification, similar species listed in a single group. Each entry is accompinied with brilliant photography, a Q&amp;A section, and useful (although cluttered) rubrics concerning minimum vivarium dimensions, appropriate diets, temperature ranges, etc. Some entries also have breeding data rubrics. Common as well as fairly exotic species are covered (the book keeps an appropriately cautious tone when describing the exotics, which are likely to be captured in the wilderness and thus sometimes unsuitable for keeping). As an endorsement, I must say that after reading the Problem Solver I was confident enough to go and buy my first reptile.	2000-11-18

The reader must be forewarned that this Twain's work is drastically different from the high adventure of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;. The reader must also be ready to grapple with the Huck's bad spelling (since the entire book is narrated from his naive perspective) and the partway-comprehensible colloquial of the dialog. In my personal experience, the book ranges from mildly engaging during the cynical criticisms, to slow as tar during the &quot;action sequences&quot; (although the action sequences are in themselves criticisms, but the humor factor isn't sufficient to overshadow the action).<br />The plot is paper-thin, and on its own leads virtually nowhere. It mostly consists of Huck and Jim ( a runaway slave) floating down the Mississippi on a raft. This journey quickly loses its point - the pair floats past the free states and just keeps going on. Nevertheless, this premise manages to propel the reader from one parody to the next with a measure of success. The social commentaries themselves are fairly original in content and in that they fit the situations well, but the reader does eventually tire of stupid, drunken, and easily-fooled villagers and the monotonous charlatans and vigilantes that populate the book's pages. An unexciting, although insightful read.	2000-11-18

The right-hand pages contain the beautiful, albeit inaccurate plates, while those on the left hand contain the written captions for the illustrations. Sadly, most captions are simplistic and not very informative (how am I to know who a flagellant is and why he must whip himself?). The individual figures and costumes are rarely numbered (although the captions frequently refer to numbers that just aren't there); some of the figures don't have any captions at all, leaving the reader in the dark.<br />Nevertheless, the sheer variety of illustrations is to be applauded. Most of the world's regions and time periods are exhaustively covered, from Roman armor to the tribal costumes from the New Hebrides to the customary vestments of nuns of the Crusade era (unfortunately, and quite logically, there is no section on modern dress).<br />However flawed this work is, it does create interest in the subject and can serve as an excellent reference for authors of various forms of fiction.	2000-11-18

Words just don't do justice. Le Guin always proves that she has a unique outlook on the world, and the Earthsea books are no exception.<br />The Wizard of Earthsea is the first part of a series of (now) four books. This part details the origins and youth of Ged - a boy from a backwater village in the great archipelago world of Earthsea. With a magical feat that saves his entire community from barbaric invaders, he shows himself to be greatly proficient in the Art. He is apprenticed to a sorceror (who nevertheless hides under the guise of a simple healer), and makes his way to the Academy on the Island of Roke. There, out of his great pride, he unleashes a shadow-thing in a contest of forbidden magics. Injured, scarred both physically and mentally, he now must flee the thing he brought into this world - or confront it.<br />One of the most surprising and masterful twists is the terse, epic writing: Le Guin does not spend time to write whole descriptive paragraphs; she sets the scenes with broad strokes of a few sentences, focusing on the most important events. This book is very quick reading.<br />Ged is an inspiring character. He can be crudely compared to Ender from Orson Scott Card's writings, or perhaps Taran from Lloyd Alexander's, in that he wields great power, by which he is burdened. The reader quickly becomes attached to his grim, brooding persona, as his quest takes him through the world. Ged is also a powerful role-model: he must acknowledge his undeniable talent and shed his fears of losing control of his powers.<br />The Wizard of Earthsea is undoubtedly a classic, a powerful work of high fantasy and spiritual development.	2000-11-08

It is also one of the book's shortcomings - this unrealistic beauty allows the reader to set unrealistic expectations. Considering the fact that this is a beginner's guide, this book contains a number of things a beginner isn't likely to need and that should have been relegated to an expert's manual. Among these things are the breeding guidelines that are present in every species' description. Likewise, several very important things have not been covered in sufficient depth. The section on feeding is quite limited. More space should have been alotted to heating and UV lamps. Vivarium construction isn't covered in nearly enough detail. There are no guidelines for picking out healthy animals at the stores, and the two-page &quot;Health&quot; spread isn't nearly sufficient. There are also descriptions of some 140 species of reptiles (including snakes and turtles), amphibians, and arthropods (tarantulas, stick insects, etc.). The sections on non-chordates (insects) are especially scant, given the degree to which the average beginner is unfamiliar with these. Each entry contains handy icons gauging aggressiveness, food preferences, number of offspring, environment, and the average difficulty of keeping the specific animal alive. And, of course, the ever-present, brilliant photographs. Generally, an underwhelming effort that nevertheless opens up several possibilities.	2000-11-08

More volumes equals more pages to flesh out your fantasy world and make it seem more real. Naturally, I couldn't afford to pass up Wizard's First Rule, the first book in the (so far) eight-book-long Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind.<br />Some decades ago, magical barriers were erected to divide the three lands: one land contained for its evil warlord's foul deeds; one fenced to keep away all magic so its inhabitants can lead happy lives; and the Midlands, where magic runs rampant. But the boundaries are weakening as a new evil boils in D'Hara, one that has the chance to enslave (or exterminate) all mankind if not defeated by the first day of winter.<br />In Wizard's First Rule everyone seems to have a love life, no matter how perverted. In fact, Goodkind seems to enjoy dropping little clues and one-liners alluding to what happens behind the scenes, as if he is trying to mask whatever flaws his writing might have with shock value. And his writing IS flawed. Goodkind cannot do narrative. His dialogues are terse and to-the-point, but his narratives are simply simplistic. Sequences of sentences that start with the same words, restate each other, and devalue the characters teem in these pages. Nevertheless, no matter how flawed, Goodkind's writing is obscenely powerful.<br />The characters are rather very flat, and, like the earlier reviewers suggested, seem totally incapable of performing their tasks. Goodkind overstates their traits. When Richard is in doubt about something, he is plagued with doubt. Here, characters aren't just depressed: they're suicidal. If there are no action sequences for a couple of pages straight, you might be tempted to toss the book across the room. Nevertheless, Goodkind is to be applauded for his moderately original world and mildly varied selection of characters. Although magic Is handled in the most generic way possible: wizards, spellbooks, evil beasts to be summoned.<br />A fun read. Very interested if the rest of the books pick up in quality.	2000-11-01

It is pretty much a collection of description of fictional tours to exotic planets, organized by their distance from Earth, each description complete with accomodations, prices, local attractions - everything a tour book should concern itself with. The book starts with the basics of space travel - takeoff, staying at an orbital station, touring the moon, Mars, and several other planets and satellites, and eventually introduces the reader to faraway (and, of course, fictional) planets, each with its own central catch (volcanic planet, mushroom-covered planet, metal planet). &quot;Galactic Tours&quot; would be intolerably dull and perhaps even irritating, but each two-page spread of descriptive text is preceded with a fantastic painting that makes the whole thing come alive. In all honesty, I cannot imagine anyone buying this book, although it does make a lasting favorable impression.	2000-10-25

It's what he does to things that are already there to make them fresh and beautiful to the jaded eye of an average human. Simple things work best in his art, evoke more raw emotion and longing: he lines tree branches with dandelions and red maple leaves; he hangs large snowballs in trees; ribbons of leaves trail off into the water and spiral icicles circle tree trunks. It's all so simple and captivating, it's really quite astounding. Goldsworthy's art is fleeting. The only reminders of his non-permanent works are photographs. In Wood, Goldsworthy goes beyond the confines of this material and shows us his mastery with the entire spectrum of natural media - snow, ice, rock, leaf, etc. The book is subdivided into sections dealing with each specific medium, the last being Tree - each work is centered around a low-lying branch of a large oak. Nevertheless, I must say that this collection of Goldsworthy's art is slightly inferior to his Collaborations with Nature, which is a better first choice if you are unfamiliar with his principles.	2000-10-21

Lloyd Alexander tackles the complex question of &quot;What makes a hero?&quot; very effectively (since the book is highly readable despite the obvious symbolic implications), and the answer he comes up with is that heroism hurts. It isn't exciting, it doesn't bring much glory (unlike expected), it's simply painful, and it's definitely not a burden to be carried lightly.<br />Pretty much the only bad thing that might be said about the book is that it has a highly contrived outset. The lords of Prydain decide to steal and destroy Arawn's Black Cauldron, which allows him to create his undead warriors, but once the mission reaches its destination, complications happen. Taran and his friends leave the army and begin a lonely quest, closely followed by the barbaric Huntsmen of Annuvin. Two key characters are introduced in this part of the Chronicles - wise Adaon, and arrogant, short-tempered Ellydyr, and the interplay of their values adds a powerful overtone of righteousness and final atonement.<br />After a long trek through the marshes, the heroes find the Cauldron in the hands of some very odd witches (who are more than they seem...). But to destroy the Cauldron a terrible price must be paid- one must willingly give up his life to it. Who will it be?	2000-10-18

The Time Patrol is a very readable compilation of stories and novelettes about what is essentially a time travel police agency. The series centers on the Unattached Agent Manse Everard - an American recruited by the agency in 1954. The stories feature a variety of fairly accurate milieus, but the series' greatest asset and greatest flaw is the complex, confusing laws and requisitions concerning time travel. The rules basically state: the time-space continuum is elastic - it returns to its normal state given enough time; when the timeline is disrupted with great vehemency or someone happens to change a key event, time changes occur immediately; if the change is drastic enough, everything &quot;up-time&quot; of the incident vanishes and is replaced by an alternate time-line following the logical consequences of the disruption. That's where the agents of the Time Patrol come in - they have to return the timeline to its original design by preventing the disrupting event. This is when the complexities kick in: since the agents' actions are monitored by the agency, each part of the event - including the agents' success, is already documented. And if the correction meets failure, why doesn't the patrol send agent after agent until it is corrected? There are numerous other details too convoluted to mention.<br />In several of the stories the dialog degenerates into simplistic monologs, and the narration gains an almost derisive sing-song quality to it. You've been forewarned.	2000-10-04

There are a few savage trolls and ogres in the snowy northern forests, but they would certainly never wear the armor they seem to be wearing on the cover.<br />I must agree with other reviewers that this is certainly the best book in the series, despite the obvious plot and cardboard characters. There are certainly a few interesting, ORIGINAL surprises, like the powers of the Bhelliom and the Troll Gods, the siege of Chyrellos and the election of the new Archprelate, and, finally, the crumbling city of Zemoch and Azash himself.<br />What really disgusts me is the grisly, mind-blowing violence that the main characters participate in and then go on with their lives like nothing happened. One incident involves an attacking Rendorish marauder being slashed in two, his upper half falling down the wall and swinging in a pendulum fashion hanging by the unrolling intestine, while his lower body remains stuck on top of the wall. But nobody really seems to care! During a later scene, Sephrenia cold-bloodedly orders a Zemoch to be beheaded right before her. Ugh.<br />There are also a few things that Eddings handles clumsily. For example, the black shadow that seems to be following Sparhawk - I recall that on one occasion Sparhawk uses the Bhelliom's powers to dissipate it, revealing the concealed [you know I won't tell you what it is], but why was it sent? What was it sent to do? What is it? And that treck across the plains of Zemoch in the dead of the winter just sems too easy. In other words, watch your step.<br />Nevertheless, at times Eddings achieves moments of high, almost classic fantasy, and there are a few instances of enchanting originality.<br />What probably seems most disappointing when you finish the series is that by the end all you did was making a circle - except for the main characters' lives, the world returns to its corruption and such. Rendorish uprising returns en force, church corruption spreads. Nevertheless, it's a great ending.	2000-10-04

To those who will read this review: this review was written specifically for the &quot;Abridged Teaching Edition&quot;, which is rather different from the full version in both length and content. The type is bigger, the chapters are smaller (thus &quot;abridged&quot;), and at the end of each there is a section of rather simplistic discussion questions (whose idea was this?).<br />I completely agree with Zinn's thesis, but can't say the same about his approach. This history book is divided into episodic chapters, the only link being their arrangement in chronological order. Some chapters take the detailed, small scale approach, while others aim at the grand scale and describe &quot;general trends&quot; in rather vague terms. In other words, the only logical way to read this book with the goal of learning something is either to read it as a supplement to another text, or already possessing a rich store of knowledge on the subject.<br />In his approach Zinn reduces every subject into a flat, two-dimensional semblance that reflects his opinion - and he does a fairly good job of engineering everything to fit his opinion. And since his thesis is to focus on the oppressed and the neglected, you should get ready for some really grim history. Nevertheless, there are a few chapters where he seemingly forgets to add the &quot;grimness filter&quot;, and what the reader ends up reading is vague, abstract history (as in &quot;Tyranny Is Tyranny&quot;).<br />The idea of adding a questions section to Zinn's book seems laughable and absurd, but, alas, it's there. THESE &quot;QUESTIONS&quot; ARE ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC!  They follow the course of the chapter, most of them simply repeating various sentences in question form!<br />A moderately interesting history book that was deeply hurt by abridgement.	2000-10-04

To be blunt, &quot;Rebecca&quot; is a romance and a murder mystery rolled into one. Just to make sure, I must tell you that I never read romances.

Our young, gauche heroine (whose name is never actually given) is suddenly proposed marriage by the brooding owner of the beautiful estate of Manderley, Maximilian de Winter. Her mind is abuzz - what does this dark brooding man find in her - a young, maladroit nobody - but cautiously accepts his offer and moves to his enourmous estate.<br />At this point the book gains something akin to momentum: the entire body of the great palace is permeated by the influence of Maximilian's late wife - Rebecca, and our heroine lives in her shadow, far too afraid to confide in her distanced husband. She feels that everyone is scrutinizing her - relatives, servants; in her mind she constantly compares herself to Rebecca - a brilliant, charismatic woman everyone loved to death - but was that all there was to her?<br />If this book is beginning to sound interesting to you - take caution. I can't say that it's not a masterpiece - but the plot moves very slowly and the pages are peppered with vivid descriptions and confusing sentence structures. Also, several others who read the book expressed concerns that several of the characters aren't fully developed (something I never noticed), and that the relationships between the major characters aren't as realistic as they would like (a claim that is at least partly true).<br />If you want to read a quality romance that isn't cliche and has appeal to fans of other genres, you might wish to give &quot;Rebecca&quot; a chance.	2000-09-23

The Ruby Knight is certainly at a disadvantage - it is the second book in a series and it has a cliffhanger ending. The plot is an almost hap-hazard pile of different things that is hung on the repetitive storyline. Eddings even adds some horror-y elements, but the attempt fails - he reveals too much too soon.<br />What holds the book together? The crew of original, interesting characters that travels to find the Bhelliom (oh, yes, that's the entire plot; I just said it). Naturally, the characters do get stale after a while: we all know that Sephrenia is always mysterious, that Talen pickpockets anyone he meets, and that Kalten is going to lop off a few heads and then complain. I suppose that we have to take that with gritted teeth.<br />Marten is completely absent from this part of the trilogy, and so is the damork. However, we do get yet another generic supernatural creature to think of as the immediate villain: the evil, insectoid &quot;Seeker&quot; is constantly at the motley band's heels.<br />In all honesty, I read this volume just because I can't fathom starting a series and then not finishing it. This was not a reading experience that I might treasure.	2000-09-20
US	50899460	R3G7PCG1J8S2LA	0805061320	159056506	The Book of Three (The Chronicles of Prydain)	Books	3	7	13	N	N	An excellent prelude to a fantastic chronicle	I know that this review will most probably attract nothing but negative votes (from flamers, if not from honest readers who take offense). Now  you're probably looking at my 3-star rating of The Book of Three and  wondering &quot;why&quot;.<br />Just for the record: The Book of Three is  painfully short, the plot is simplistic, and the characters do not achieve  much development. Nevertheless, it is the perfect introduction to the  amazingly written Chronicles of Prydain. It introduces you to a slew of  believable, three-dimensional characters and Lloyd Alexander's unique kind  of heartwarming humor. <br />The Book of Three is short (read: it's too  expensive for a hardcover its size). I finished it in about an evening  (reading for the first time, carefully paying attention to details and  memorizing the Welsh names). In some respects it is a tutorial to prepare  the reader for the much more sober and grim books that follow it.<br />What's  the plot (or at least its premise)? Taran is an assistant pig-keeper at  Caer Dallben, the safest, and perhaps the dullest place in all of the  magical land of Prydain. A dark army gathers in the name of the Death Lord  headed by a hideous leader, a man so grisly that Hen Wen, the oracular pig  Taran is charged with, escapes into the forest. Taran follows it, and,  after meeting with a few unique and interesting characters, learns that  being a hero is hard and unfulfilling work, and that the only true wealth  is that of spirit.<br />This sort of uplifting, deeply spiritual fantasy  rarely appears nowaday. You'd do well to pick up this book and the other  parts of the quintet, whatever your age might be, if you want to bring the  glow of simple pleasures into your life.<br />The Book of Three (and the  remainder of the books in the series) are closely based on Welsh mythology,  particularly the Mabynogeon, although the good and evil are more precisely  defined. There are a number of obscure references to Welsh mythology  throughout the series (they don't get in the way of the plot).	2000-08-24

Robie correlates the most disjointed of events without even flinching at the gaps in her logic. She misquotes materials, quotes materials that are hopelessly  out of date (such as most of the magazine articles), and otherwise  desperately tries to give some weight to her deranged ramblings she tries  to pass off as truth.<br />What is D&amp;D (and other RPGs)? They are  interactive fairy tales with a variety of settings. One person, the Game  Master tells the general story and the players describe their actions. In  other words, the group generates a plot with the players as characters in  it. Yes, most of the logistics behind RPGs clash with Christian beliefs  (magic, pantheons, etc.), but so does much of the Odyssey, the Mabynogion,  Beowulf, and a great number of other ancient non-Christian classics. If you  are offended, don't play! We aren't going to come out and get you!<br />As far  as to the obscesion/demon worship/violent behaviour presumably caused by  D&amp;D and other role-playing games, these cases must be judged on  case-by-case basis. RPGs aren't inherently harmful. Let me give you a basic  example: Let's assume I have a carrot. I have four  options: I can ingest  it as a mormal human being; I can discard it because I am allergic to it; I  can presume that it is a phallic symbol and worship it; or I can commit  suicide by jamming it up my nose. If I chose the latter two, would you  blame the poor tuber? Same is for RPGs. If you can't keep up with reality,  if you have trouble distinguishing fact from fiction, I don't think you  should play games of make-believe.<br />I recently found a great web page that  rewords much of the stuff from this book despite being a parody. If you  want to see the leaps of faith that every fundamentalist...<br />I know that the address  is a mouthful, but it's worth it. If the address does not show up in the  final review, go to my member page and e-mail me from there.<br />Year after  year, my faith in humanity wavers and wavers. If books like this can see  print, what will happen next? How low will we go?	2000-08-17

Had it received enough media attention (or were it written today), it would  have almost certainly garnered as much (or more!) hype as Harry Potter.  Don't make the mistak, though! Ender's Game is not a children's book,  despite the fact that most of its characters are children - the deeply  questionable ethical discussions, the overall message and trimmings of the  book may confuse children, or simply pass over their heads.<br />An unprepared  Earth has been target of a sudden, devastating attack by the mysterious  alien Buggers, and to prevent it from happening twice, the command of Earth  has been seized by the military. Thus, Earth is unified - for now. The  military is examining and collecting especially bright children for  advanced military training for important military positions. The training  takes place at the top-secret Battle School - an enourmous orbiting  complex. But Andrew Wiggin - Ender - is special. For some reason, the  teachers single him out. He is grouped with inept platoons for the mock  battles. Teachers try to goad him into falling over the brink, breaking  down his moral values, his sense of pity and commiseration. In other words,  they are making him into a perfect weapon - Earth's only hope for the final  battle against its alien invaders.<br />Why is Ender's Game so successful?  Because Card created one of the most appealing central characters the world  has ever seen: Ender is young (don't you want to re-experience childhood?),  he is amazingly intelligent (don't you think of yourself as intelligent?),  and the entire world is out to get him (self-explanatory). Never mind that  the convoluted train-of-thought passages are often discussions of complex  ethical dilemmas, and that the answers that Card achieves may surprise or  shock you. Never mind the appaling lack of imagery, the low number of  well-developed characters, cliche aliens, and some very questionable  scientific premises. Ender's Game is all about your ability to associate  with Ender. By the book's end you will be ready to die for him if needs  be.<br />The chapters increase the pace, bit by bit. The epilogue is truly  stunning. It sets you up with royal hopes for the remainder of the books in  the series. Alas, that path is strewn with disappointments :(	2000-08-09

Although my tastes in fantasy may not be the finest in the world, I easily consider this a politics-and-swords-and-sorcery novel of the highest  caliber. Finely characterized and filled wih luscious imagery, the first  book of the Elenium series combines the traditional (and somewhat cliche)  band-of-heroes epic with a healthy dose of realism, political intrigue, and  a masterfully wrought background.<br />The plot centers around the kingdom of  Elenia on the Eosian continent, in the twentieth century of world filled  with ritualistic magic. A dark force gathers on the horizon, while the  power-hungry Prelate of Eosia attempts to cripple the kingdom by crowning  an illegitimate monarch, dishonoring the knighthood, sparking a belligerent  movement in the Southern lands, and otherwise bringing himself closer to  the ageing Archprelate's throne. Queen Ehlana herself falls deathly ill and  is only saved through magic that channels the knights' life forces to  nourish her. So begins this novel about a race against time to find a cure  and to save the kingdom.<br />If the plot sounds a bit overused, it is saved  by the deeply cynical narrative, nicely developed characters (the novel is  told mainly from the perspective of Sparhawk, the Queen's Champion), and  the novel's overall believability. Eddings certainly took his time creaing  a variety of mileaus for the heroes to visit, building up every aspect,  from the visuals to the local cuisine to architecture to religion. Magic in  the novel is usually divine in origin, and not quite as rampant as in ny  number of other fantasy novels, but even this aspect is tied nicely into  the remainder of the plot.<br />Oh, yes, the book contains lots of references  to death, torture, a variety of sexually explicit situations: in other  words - &quot;action&quot;. It makes a nice transition from the standard  high fantasy genre to the more realistic forms of fantasy.	2000-08-09

I admit it, the main part of the book takes place long before the Stone Age and the coming of man in general. Although it takes a while to pick up, this story of one-way time travel to a romantic Pliocene gone awry, that  turns into a story of captivity, that turns into a story of liberation  becomes a page-turner relatively quickly. This is probably the closest that  &quot;legitimate&quot; science fiction will come to a fantasy epic. Julian  May has great mastery with imagery, that, coupled with complex  characterization, an interesting genre-bending mileau, and a solid  scientific foundation, results in the beginning to a highly readable series  that has a lot of potential (and, yes, I realize that it is indeed a  finished series, but so far I am only done with book one). Overall, an  excellent read.	2000-07-31

Topics touched upon include various discussions of cancer/mutations, extraterrestrial life/astonomy, various advances in VR and other forms of technology, and  much, much more. Since I am not a great fan of X-Files, I cannot attest  about the book's fidelity to the show, but I should think that it is, since  there is quite a number of quoted episodes. Even more than the show, the  book exudes a rather creepy feeling about just how fragile we are as  individuals, and in that respect it is inappropriate to especially  sensitive readers (if any of them enjoyed the show to begin with...). The  book succeeds in that it makes most of the odd scientific data relatively  easy to swallow and actually has the gut to admit that the writers did make  errors. However, at no point did I feel that what I was reading was overly  incredulous, or that the author was overly condescending about the show's  errors.<br />Keep watching the skies for more books like this one.	2000-07-31

At first sight this book might seem loaded with cliches: its a part of a saga, it has goblins, dragons, and unicorns, and, quite naturally, the protagonists are a &quot;band of unlikely heroes&quot; (a despondent  knight, an overprotective tribesman, a sorcerous princess, a wise but  tortured leader, a grumpy dwarf, a sinister mage, and a naive, fearless  hobbit-type character fill the extensive cast of heroes). So how does the  first book in the Dragonlance Chronicles manage to hold its own, and,  moreover, become a long-time bestseller? It has a believable, cohesive  plot, it is communicated in a clear, precise language, it is filled with  brilliant imagery, and it doesn't try to mimic the modern world (unlike the  hundreds of &quot;pagan fantasy&quot; novels that are flooding the market  today).<br />The first novel about the world of Dragonlance was created out of  the AD&amp;D game, which enjoys quite a number of interesting settings.  Nevertheless, this is legitimate fantasy (I wrote this sentense for the  people who sneer at the mention of role-playing) at its highest. Whether  Tanis and friends are dealing with undead, ancient temples, dragons, or  other obstacles, we, as the readers, are always treated to sophisticated  ethical dilemmas and intelligent thinking. <br />However standard the plot  might seem (an old evil rises once again) by fantasy standards, it seems  fresh and interesting, because the novel doesn't focus on any one aspect of  fantasy - there's mystery, suspence, thrill abound, open-mouthed awe,  romance, drama, pretty much everything. The characters are living people,  rather than sword-swinging smart-mouthed automatons.<br />Oh, a word of  warning: there are over eighty books set in the world of Dragonlance. And  not all of them are good. Try and be intelligent.	2000-07-24

To anyone who has a background in Russian folklore (I don't have a degree, I just grew up there), the villain characters will seem artificial and unrealistic. Card barely taps the deep  vein of traditional Russian folklore. He barely even evokes the magnificent  spirit. Card also seems convinced that profanity somehow lends credence to  his writing. A number of unnecessary tangents coming off his characteristic  &quot;train of thought&quot; passages distracts the reader. His utter lack  of imagery leads to disinterest despite the tighly-knit story with several  good characters. On the other hand, some points in the story were not  explained enough, especially some parts in the beginning, leading to  confusion. While Card means well (or does he?), he still manages to write  several questionable opinions of religion that I'm sure SOMEONE will find  distasteful. Finally, all characters behave as if they were just out of US:  I felt no feeling of &quot;immersion&quot; into a foreign culture.<br />I'm  not saying that it's a bad book. It's just the last book you want to open  if you want to find out about Russian folklore.	2000-07-17

Obviously enough, there is just no possibility that in a single year there will be enough groundbreaking science fiction and fantasy written to fill a book the size of Nebula Awards 30. In fact, some of the pieces in this  collection are downright tepid (at least in my opinion, but yours may  differ). Included within are:<br />Seven Views of Olduvai Gorge by Mike  Resnick: an alien archeologist gets seven glimpses into the nature of  mankind (now extinct), on a progressively more radioactive Earth. May drag  around the edges. 4 stars.<br />Inspiration by Ben Bova: a visitor from the  future attempts to give young Einstein the impetus to voice his beliefs on  physics (and thus, oddly enough, save the future Earth from being a  radioactive dump) by giving him a copy of Well's The Time Machine. Not  quite interesting. 3 stars.<br />Virtual Love by Maureen F. McHugh: two online  virtuosos, off-line nobodies, are mesmerized by each other's mastery with  false visages. Nice imagery. 4 stars.<br />None So Blind by Joe Halderman:  &quot;Why aren't blind people geniuses?&quot; A child genius falls in love  with a blind musician and creates a greater intelligence. 3  stars.<br />Fortyday by Damon Knight: in an alternate Roman Empire humans grow  biologically older until they are forty, and then age in reverse. 4  stars.<br />In Memoriam: Robert Bloch by Frank M. Robinson: an overview of  Robert Bloch's life (Bloch died in 1994).<br />The Martian Child by David  Gerrold: Not quite science fiction. A sci-fi writer father suspects that  his adopted child is a Martian. Very endearing. 4 stars.<br />Rhysling Award  Winners - poetry by W. Gregory Stweart and Robert Frazier, Jeff Vandermeer,  and Bruce Boston: since I never enjoyed Science fiction poetry, I will not  evaluate this part.<br />Understanding Enthropy by Barry N. Malzberg: It  doesn't have a plot. 2 stars.<br />I Know What You're Thinking by Kate  Wilhelm: A telepathic Woman can't blot out the chatter in her mind and  starts taking pictures of contemplating criminals as a hobby. It drags. 3  stars.<br />A defense of Social Contracts by Martha Soukup: In a society where  strife is minimized by one's marital permit - monogamous, polygamous, or  free not to marry, a woman seeks to illegally bind a  &quot;nonmonogamous&quot; man to herself with false marital documents. This  is the ultimate in writing about sex with absolutely no emotion whatsoever.  3 stars.<br />From a Park Bench to the Great Beyond: The Science Fiction and  Fantasy Films of 1994 by Kathi Maio: an overview of exactly what the title  says. Non-fiction.<br />The Matter of Segri by Ursula LeGuin: Yet another  story in the Ekumen series - a planet, where men are basically breeder  drones and women are the only part of the organized society per se, is  slowly nudged towards the &quot;standards&quot;. Lots and lots of the  f-word. Come on, she could have used a synomim!  4 stars.<br />An Excerpt from  Moving Mars by Gregory Benford: since this is only an excerpt, I cannot  grade it.	2000-07-10

It is simple and inspiring; it stands on a solid foundation of myths and legends (in this case, Welsh myths and legends); and it's not swarming with  magic. The book actually has closure as it was written well before the  plague of sequels and prequels the literary world is facing today. <br />The  tale told is that of coming of age and the search for identity. At the  tale's (or tales') outset, Taran, a young boy begins his adventuring career  as he searches for the escaped oracular pig, and is quickly entangled in a  quest to stop a war. As Taran matures, he learns that war and struggle does  not hold as much attraction as he thought it did, eventually becoming one  of the key people in the effort to prevent the world from descending into  the clutches of Arawn, the lord of the Land of Death.<br />In effect, the  books are quite similar to White's &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;,  although by the end of the quintet Taran is (quite thankfully) still young,  although no longer a boy.<br />The narrative is clear, and most of the native  names are included in the pronunciation key at the end of the book (unless  this is not the same edition that I'm thinking of). As far as I know, there  are no overly disagreeable scenes throughout the chronicles, and this  &quot;lack&quot; does not spoil the quality. I quite easily can recommend  this to children as easily as to adults.	2000-07-06

Whatever attention to detail there is, the maps are simply too confusing and muddled: there are often several  cut-away views in one map, the scale is hard to determine, it is hard to  differentiate between various layers of depth, and the choice of  perspectives is questionable. Instead of the black/grey/sepia tones of the  Atlas of Middle Earth (by the same author), now we have large quantities of  out-of-place green all over the pages. To repeat myself, the attention to  detail is nice, but several of the sources are so outlandish that it is  hard to determine where exactly on the map concrete facts end and Caren  Wynn Fonstad's imagination begins. Exact lines are not quoted where they  might be expected; rather, we are provided with page and line numbers.  Lastly, unlike the above-mentioned Atlas of Middle Earth, Atlas of  Dragonlance DOES NOT follow the plots of the books, but uses a  region-by-region scheme, making actually following the maps as you are  reading into a frustrating chore.	2000-07-03

I don't know why. They share very little.<br />There is a planet in space that was created aeons ago  by a long-gone race that achieved the ultimate in technology. Its area is  precisely delineated into 1460 hexagonal biomes, each home to a separate  intelligent species, half of which (the entire northern hemisphere to be  exact) are non-carbon-based and non-humanoid in both mental and physical  faculties. It's rather like going to the zoo - as the characters make their  way through hex after hex of alien terrain your heart is filled with awe of  the next big surprise civilization that Chalker has prepaired for  you.<br />And although in the beginning the book may seem to be the average  blood-and-guts-and-sex romance set on another planet, you are soon  enveloped in an enourmous mistery (that easily dwarfs that of Card's  Speaker for the Dead) of interspecies proportions. Touched upon is the  eternal question of what makes us human (and Chalker's human civilization  of genderless drug-controlled clones is most certainly not human), and,  finally, for the big finale, the characters are allowed to alter anything  in the universe and the reader gets a brief glimpse of God.<br />The plot is  original and the characters are quite believable. Even the aliens, although  they do seem a bit too human (the White House is filled with the human  equivalent of Akkafians). Belive me, it's a worthwhile read.	2000-06-26
US	50899460	RSY2IP2KHTDS4	0345422031	359626881	Cthulhu 2000	Books	3	7	11	N	N	This is not Cthulhu	Judging by the amount of negative feedback I received about my first review of Cthulhu 2000 in such a short period of time (please, e-mail with suggestons rather than press that button), that particular review was not  particularly helpful. Sigh. Therefore I would like to clarify  myself:<br />First of all, this is not Cthulhu. It lacks the rich Lovecraftian  vocabulary (the only few words the authors picked up from Lovecraft's  writing seem to be &quot;eldritch&quot; and &quot;foetor&quot;) that  allowed the original Cthulhu books to become such dark, sophisticated  masterpieces. Second of all, few of the stories in this volume actually tie  in with the Cthulhu mythos. Yes, there is plenty of voodoo, witchcraft, and  forbidden magics, but it rarely goes beyond that to tap into the mysteries  of the Elder Gods and the Ones Who Fell from the Stars. And that is quite  sad, because the topics that these authors do use have long since become  hackneyed and cliche. Thirdly, and most important of all, the stories in  Cthulhu 2000 all diverge from Lovecraftian ideology to become standard  blood/ichor/sex-filled stuff of modern &quot;horror&quot;. Whereas  Lovecraft above all desired to let humankind take notice that there are  secrets innumerable and forces unfathomable beyond the stars, Cthulhu 2000  is simple horror, easily classifiable and as easily forgotten.	2000-06-10

It was to impress the mind with the sense of awe and wonder, to impugn upon it that there are ineffable, unfathomable things lurking in the universe, things that we  cannot analyze and understand. Naturally, since humans tend to be afraid of  the unknown, Lovecraft's reasoning led him to the use of terror as the  conveyer of awe. One who reads Lovecraft just for the sake of seeing a few  characters get eaten or dismembered is avoiding the best parts. In theory  one reads Lovecraft to become disturbed. To expand his mind beyond what is  considered human, to break out of the bounds of placidity and decadence,  self-assuredness and security, and to feel it in his heart of hearts that  humans are not the masters of the world.<br />At the Mountains of Madness sits  proudly as one of Lovecraft's greatest achievements. It is a tale of time  immemorial and of an incredible civilization that came to Earth long before  it was populated. A truly stellar read that leads one to thinking where  exactly humanity's evolution will lead. One of the greatest features of  Lovecraft's horror is that all of his stories are interwoven into a single  nighmarish parchment- at the mountains of madness is no exception: it  includes a number of references to both Cthulhu and the quasi-real  &quot;Necronomicon&quot;.<br />Oddly enough, the other stories included in  this selection (especially Shunned House, probably because it is about what  one might probably call a vampire - in the pre-Dracula sense of the word)  don't seem to be quite as deep and absorbing as the first.<br />Nevertheless,  if you care for a new view of the world around you, one where you do not  dominate - please, read this book. I myself am too far gone...	2000-05-27
US	50899460	R5HI0EH598TMW	031286857X	546958481	Bios	Books	3	4	7	N	N	Clinically cold	As Ursual le Guin remarked in her inroduction to &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, &quot;anything carried to its logical extreme is despressing, even cancerogenic&quot;. Bios makes this very mistake on  numerous occasions. First of all, it lacks any and all human element. I  could not accept any of the characters as LIVING PEOPLE, but more as just a  few more entities that would eventually succumb to the &quot;bleedout and  deliquescence&quot; that is so gratuitously plentiful in Bios. Dialogue is  indeed scant, and, unlike Ender's Game (yet another nearly inhuman book),  author does little in the way of interjecting words spoken out-loud with  words not spoken at all. Time shifts are rarely paid atention to, and I had  trouble keeping track of who was the viewpoint character. Naturally, with  the characters gone from view one begins to pay more attention to the  setting. It took me only a few pages to discover the amazing floweriness of  scientific terminology. The author has a seemingly insatiable desire to  explain the technical details of every single device, as if to stop the  reader from taking notice of the book's glaring deficiencies. Literally  every word is preceeded with an explanatory adjective of the most  &quot;hard SF&quot; sort, which in itself is, first of all, rather  annoying, and, second of all, leads the reader to believe that the author  though of the book as lacking in credibility. Aside from these I thought  that the world of Isis, the most important force in the entire book, is far  too underdeveloped. When I read about wondrous new worlds, I want to know  something about them!<br />Despite its flaws Bios manages to collect a rather  unhealthy attention.

Almost everything about this book was utterly unnecessary. Each deity gets approximately two paragraps worth of  dry and frequently incorrect descriptive text, followed by the combat stats  of his &quot;avatar&quot;, and that followed by the specific stats of the  deity's priests. And I tell you: anyone foolish enough to charge headfirst  at the earthly incarnation of a deity is a complete and total moron! Why  include combat stats for something no one should ever engage in combat? Is  TSR catering to the high-level hack-and-slashers by presenting them with a  smallish volume of powerful foes? Why, but that was the very reason why  this volume was published: Deities and Demigods was too much of a Monster  Manual in its heart of hearts!<br />No one with at least a drop of imagination  and the ability to flip pages shold attempts to purchase this relatively  rare, out-of-print, and expensive book. It packs NOTHING original. Read  about world's religions in AUTHORITATIVE books, or make the details up if  you don't feel like reading. Please.	2000-05-24

In my opinion this book fails to emphasize a very important aspect of horror writing - originality. William Nolan does a very good job describing the mechanics of horror (how to establish a sense of mystery, implication  rather thahn description, how to make your character seem easy to harm, how  to allow the reader to identify with the character, etc.), but the  aftertaste of the book seems to tell that what it tells you to do is enough  to be a successful writer. I wouldn't recommend continually referring to  this book - it won't let you to develop your own style.	2000-05-20

Useful for writers of all genres because  within are described poisons found in nature as well as those found in  industry, household, and many, many others. Although there isn't quite  enough specific information, there are plenty of leads for research, and,  after all, the book wasn't designed as a complete reference - it's just  very, very useful. Included are a useful glossary of medical terms, and a  section of tables further organizing the toxins by symptoms, toxicity, and  speed of action. In a word - indispensable.	2000-05-20

But the &quot;Cthulhu&quot; in the title is something of a mistake. This isn't real Cthulhu for various reasons (story one is too blunt with  descriptions, story two is far too humorous - moreover it underlines the  &quot;frogs chanting &quot;IA!&quot; line in the book's introduction), and  by posing as Cthulhu it destroys the charm of the original. By glancing at  what the authors fancy to be the underpinnings of Cthulhu, you make it  closer to yourself, endowing it with motives and an understandable course  of action. I especially hate &quot;Pickman's Modem&quot; because it manages  to give Cthulhu a humorous side. After reading Cthulhu 2000 I went back and  read The Color Out of Space in the middle of the night. It had no impact  whatsoever on me. Read this book at your own risk.	2000-05-20

This setting seems to promote wholesale dumping of real- world history into a fictional  setting. Not only is this extremely contrived, but it also is an insult to  role-players' creativity in general. The &quot;setting&quot; is thinly  disguised Central America of approximately sixteenth/seventeenth centuries,  spiced with mutations. Pretty much everything is named in very generic  Spanish (White Mountain, Blue House, Long River). Most of the campaign  seems to emphasize recovery of treasure left by the long-gone Aztec-like  culture. There is hardly any role-playing at all: virtually the entire  campaign screams &quot;combat-oriented dungeon crawl&quot;. The Legacies  resulting from the ever-present &quot;Red Curse&quot; are somewhat  interesting, but the setting hardly tangles with the implications of  wide-spread mutations. A very poor job from TSR.	2000-05-20

Once you notice that Ender's Shadow is so powerful only  because it nearly mirrors Ender's Game (but never quite equals it), it loses reading value. I would enourmously advise reading this PRIOR to Ender's Game (sans the  ending, of course) for a true tour de force.<br />The basic premise of the  book is a view of the same events as in Ender's Game through a pair of  different eyes - the eyes of a cold-blooded survavalist, a semi-success,  more intelligent than anyone around, a child able to figure out anything,  capable of carrying out a total security breach in a space-born top-secret  facility.<br />Perhaps this book fails because of its lack of a human element.  Bean is not equally as sympathetic as Ender. His calculative emotionless is  underlined time and time again, probably because Card has a habit of  writing out everything his protagonists think. By the same token Bean  doesn't seem to be suffering as much as Ender, both in Rotterdam and Battle  School. He comes out unscathed from every situation. And, naturally, since  Card is not emotionless himself, you can sense flaws in Bean's design, and  that distracts. Bean's self-discovery seems slavish - one reviewer of  Ender's Game remarked that it was an attempt to glorify slavery and fascism  - I believe that remark is very fitting in this case. The plot, by default,  centers once again on Ender.<br />The imagery lacks - as always. At times I  was forced to stop reading and visualize where exactly particular air ducts  went. Even characterization is a far cry to Ender's Game (particularly in  Achilles' case, if you sense my drift). Bean's wondrous intelligence is  offset by the fact that he presumes nearly everyone to be stupid: whereas  Bonso Madrid had the refined fury in Ender's Game, here he is simply  crude.<br />The Earthside elements seem a bit contrived, but despite Sister  Carlotta's one-dimensionality I felt more for her than I did for Bean, and  that is perhaps the worst thing there is to say abouta book.<br />If only the  book wasn't centered on Ender, it would have been much more of a success.  As it is, it doesn't quite rack up to the original.	2000-05-15

Quite  instantly presented me with an insatiable interest of the subject. Precise,  academical, and completely accessible for literally anyone (it was  accessible for me!), Outlines is the perfect reference work for an aspiring  beginner. It is illustrated in black-and-white where illustrations might be  expected, all specific terms are followed by the Chinese hieroglyphs, and,  overall, this seems to be a very solid and well-written work.

Most aren't quite complete, and some ramble on and  on and on and have totally unnecessary percentile tables and other things  that obviously waste space.<br />This book is, however, gratuitously  recommended for the complete &quot;alienness&quot;.

Don't buy this book if you're new to the  hobby. You will not understand what's so good about this thing and you will  feel cheated out of you money.

Or perhaps not - it all depends on the taste and how likely he is to become a writer. As a monstrous compendium from a long-dead campaign, in the old  hole-punched style, with black-and-white pictures, it attracts gamers like  flies. Fortunately it is also relatively cheap (not for its worth, mind  you, but in a general sense - it costs ten dollars in mint condition) and  is easy to find either at the local large hobby store or online at the  Wizards of the Coasts site (...). The compendium will not  displease the refined, experienced AD&amp;Der looking for something  different: the closest thing I can compare it to is either the old  Traveller or the new Alternity. Many alien, twisted, warped things, and a  couple of robotic terrors spice up the melange. Don't pass it by.	2000-05-13

Even before I realized that this priceless compilation of architectural styles had a use I was attracted to it like a moth is  attracted to a flickering light. Scientific studies show that moths fly  into the light because of an intense parallax effect: moths find direction  by the angle of the light, and the angle changes as the moth flies by,  forcing it to veer off into the lamp in order to keep going  &quot;forward&quot;. Fortunately enough, contact with this book is not  quite as damaging for you as it is for the above-mentioned moth, however  alluring the prospect might be.<br />Every beautiful page of American Shelter  is devoted entirely to a specific architectural style, which is usually  described in terms of a large, detailed line drawing from a 3/4 above view,  followed by several sketches detailing the dimensions, followed with a  simplified sketch explaining the style's basic shapes, all finally  elucidated by a written passage. American Shelter is as useful to the  architect as it is to the writer as it is to the researcher. Enjoy.	2000-05-10

It describes the species of the entirely fictional order of mammals,  Rhinogradentia (also known as the Snouters), found only in the Hi-Yay  Islands, the distinguishing trait being a remarkably adapted nose. The  author follows the projected evolution of the order from the early  representatives, whose snout is merely an elongated bill-shaped appendage  aiding the animal's rolling method of propulsion, to the most extreme and  elaborate species with fully-articulated noses used in a variety of methods  of locomotion - springing, sessility, and, in one case, gliding. This  excellent study is an amazing read even for the non-biologist. It is also  quite useful in portrayal of evolution and adaptation to the surroundings.  Vehemently recommended.	2000-05-03

The handbook deals with a number of features rarely grappled with when creating a world, but almost  any section can be summed up in a couple of sentences. Moreover, the  material is dispersed with seemingly no logical scheme. Despite the fact  that the consecutive chapters &quot;zoom in&quot; into the campaign world,  I frequently had to hunt down specific useful portions of the chapters  which were seemingly misplaced. Other parts are simply redundant, such as  the random terrain tables, which are repeated in several sections. Another  gripe of mine was that the material presented was hardly inspiring. The  author on several occasions clearly endorses copying maps from boxed  adventures or ripping off major works of fantasy literature. The random  selection of cultures is even more questionable. The author simply lists  various cultures and ages from the real world. This sort of thing seems to  be the current trend for TSR. The only time actual use of creativity was  encouraged was a statement that said approximately &quot;What if firearms  were invented in the Roman Empire?&quot;. The maps were unnecessary for the  most part. They are also printed in blue and yellow which makes them rather  hard to read. Overall, the book looks and feels amateurish. I rather liked  the section on the creation of towns and villages, which details the  game-relevant professions and the overall demographics of standard medieval  settlements in reasonable detail. All in all it is pretty useless.	2000-05-02

Right here, pages 47 and 48, where she gives her reasoning and summarizes the evils of TMNT. And I quote, word for word:<br />&quot;Savior -  Splinter (god-like figure, mentor, religious  leader) is a giant-sized rat that is said to have rescued the Turtles from  radiation and educated them into the Ninja Arts. This giant rat also acts  as a father to the turtles in the cartoons, comic books, etc. Should a  giant-sized rat become like God? Isn't this blasphemy?&quot; Why is a  father figure god? Splinter is Turtles' mentor and guardian, not a  religious leader.<br />&quot;Crime - The Shredder, is said to be ruthless and  vengeful and has a brilliant criminal mind. Should we teach our children  that crime pays?&quot; But crime does pay! Why else would people commit  it! <br />&quot;Eastern Religions - Krang is the spiritual leader of Shredder.  Krang speaks from his middle (stomach) where a demonic-like figure is  visible.&quot; Now here's an insult! Krang is a slug-like alien who moves  by the means of a robotic humanoid suit. Krang's control hub is located in  the suit's mid-section. This character was not intended as a perverse  religion, but as a most unlikely and cliche alien possible.<br />&quot;Sex -  in the Archie comics April O'Neal is seen as a voluptuous and sexy female.  In the movie O'Neal's skirts are so short (or she is wearing shorts) that  they reveal her legs almost to the top of the thigh. Should our children  see women only as sex images?&quot; I doubt that prepubescent children can  comprehend the concept of a sex image. Moreover, a skirt that reveals the  top of the thigh is a geometric impossibility. Thirdly, I have seen the  film and know the above claims to be entirely false. O'Neal is merely  wearing the clothes that were in vogue at the time.<br />&quot;Darkness - The  movie (which is rated PG and recommended for 4 to 12 year-olds) takes place  in darkness where &quot;night action&quot; occurs. Children are prone to be  afraid of the dark. Many evil deeds are done in darkness. The Bible  says...men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil  (John 3:19).&quot; Children are afraid of the dark because it deprives them  of sensory input, and, therefore, their link to the safe world around them.  Obviously, for children who are watching the film in a well-lit room the  darkness is not much trouble. Moreover, the film was recommended for  children from 7 to 13 years of age.<br />&quot;Weapons - names of ninja  (lethal) weapons, their description and use are incorporated into the  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series.&quot; Note that only one of the  Turtles' weapons is edged. All others are lethal only in the hands of a  professional. Also, for some reason the author obscesses with the ninja  axe, the bisento. None of the characters use it.<br />&quot;Meditation - The  Ninja uses meditation to obtain physical power and &quot;inner  strength.&quot; Meditation is a religion that does not accept Jesus Christ,  the Messiah as the one true God.&quot; Meditation is not a religion. It is  merely a method of relaxation and concentration.<br />Furthermore, Joan Hakes  Robie uses piteous and disturbingly implicit drawings of the Turtles to  prove her point. Come on, this series was created for teenagers as a spoof  of all others! It hasn't a hint of great violence!	2000-04-29

Personally, I am glad that this is the end of the &quot;EnderSaga&quot;. Basically every character has already been exploited tothe fullest, and addition of any more characters would seem artificial and contrived. It is particularly sad that Card doesn't seem to intend to flesh out the characters fully - in some places (particularly Grace Drinker's house) the chracters don't seem to think, but rather blurt out pieces of the plot.  They are either omniscient or Card chose to leave out the wonderful passages delineating the characters' train of thought that were the key features of the earlier books. Likewise, the imagery is quite lacking.  Despite the fact that the characters hop from planet to planet I felt little difference. The very idea that each nationality settled a single planet that is exactly like their homeland seems &quot;a bit&quot; contrived. The superscience (exchanges of soul, instant travel, etc.) is poorly handled, at least in my opinion. Card seems to use Jane's &quot;teleportation&quot; just like Ender's incredible intelligence in Ender's Game, to surpise and overwhelm foes. But unlike Ender's Game, where the reader cheers for Ender, in CotM I found myself thinking that Wang Mu and Peter were exploiting someone else's resources. It is truly a sad sight to see one's once-favorite character's die down. The plot is somewhat naive. The character's are either tangled up in their personal relationships or are very crude in their means (once again, Peter and Wang Mu). All in all, I am happy that this is the end. Any more would be stupid.	2000-04-21

In search of real  life dungeons, the steam tunnels under the Michigan State University were  searched with great fanfare, and the newspapers ate it up in a month-long  media circus. When Egbert was eventually located, it was revealed that his  disappearance had nothing to do with Dungeons and Dragons (he'd been  visiting a relative), but by that time the game had been indelibly linked  in the minds of some people with occultism and mental illness. (Heroic  Worlds, by Lawrence Schick)&quot;<br />Even until now this 1979 incident seems  to prove to some people that using one's imagination is evil and dangerous.  I recently received an e-mail, convicting me of spreading gangerous ideas  (not based on the review for this book, but it will do). The sender told me  that a child shot several others &quot;acting out his AD&amp;D  fantasies&quot;. AD&amp;D does not reward outright murder. And if one has  fantasies of murder, he's insane!	2000-04-12

However, for a 176-page book it offers an amazingly obvious lack of  information, perhaps because there are simply far too many graphics which  do not support the text but merely illustrate the megaliths in question  from various vantage points.  There is little to be found on the subject of  the stones' religious background, as well as anything about the culture of  the people who erected them. At best, this book may be useful in acquiring  the basic knowledge of the subject.	2000-04-08

I can certainly say that the odds of you  reading something that is described in the book are slim to nil (outside  the obvious entries, like Pern, which was perfectly mapped out a long time  prior).

All of the archaic words that have boggled generations of readers have been explained, and the story can be seen in a  new light due to the implications these words arouse. Also are included the  illustrations from the foreign versions of the book (several are quite  funny - like the way in which the various nations imagine the dwarves and  Gandalf - especially those whose mythology includes neither dwarves nor  wizards).

Like a reviewer below has noted, Bradbury presents us with no central character, no centralized plot, no guidelines, generally nothing that will  give the reader a hold on the situation. There are only two recurring  things, Man and Mars. This is where the book's strength lies - it presents  how different people deal with the endless mystery of Mars: some see it as  an enemy; others try to protect its sanctity, even at the expense of their  mates' lives; yet others see it as a great opportunity. Throughout the  entire book the reader has two goals - observing the characters' reaction  to this ancient world, and figuring out for themselves what exactly is  Mars's mystery. The latter is never directly explained. Perhaps the only  disagreeable thing in the book are the radically diferent presentations of  Martians: one is the people of a radically different world, mystic,  romantic, unseen; they are present in most of the book. But the Chronicles'  beginning illustrates a different kind of Martians - human-like, petty,  squabbling, paranoid. In any case, The Martian Chronicles is a monumental  work of incredible thought and untouched values. I would eagerly advise it  to anyone searching for deeper meaning of things. This book may have all of  the answers.	2000-04-01

First of all, the book's format is not easily digested. In a true canonic tradition, Silmarillion does away with many years in a single  sentence. I would advise taking notes. Likewise, there are far too many  names in order for the reader to remember them, and, however realistic it  might be, I can never recall the similar names of many of the elfin heroes.  On a final note, and this is where many of you will object to what I say,  Silmarillion is an overview of a CLASSIC fantasy world - i.e. if the reader  is familiar with fantasy, he will find little originality in the basics of  this otherwise groundbreaking piece of work.	2000-04-01

Alas, Amazon doesn't have it. Dragon Wing is the first in a a series of seven books of the Death Gate series. Along with wonderfully fleshed characters and grand imagery, I was  pleasantly surprised to see that not one bit of standard fantasy material  is to be seen, anywhere. There are no standard dragons, no standard goblins  or magic. The rest of the series is all the more fascinating. This part  details the journeys of Hugh, an assassin, through the world of Arianus, a  land of floating land, one of the four elemental realms created by the  Sartan wizards millennia ago, after the real world has suffered a horrible  fate. Another trait of this book is that it's not the classic happy lit-up  fantasy in the style of Ed Greenwood, but more of a chilly, muddy fantasy  in the style of Norton's Witchworld, that really conveys the overall  atmosphere. How wonderful to see an author break away from their regular  routine (Dragonlance, in this case), and create a totally new world.	2000-03-25

Centering around the life of the  protagonist, a hopeles young man with grand aspirations, stuck forever in a  menial job at a shoe-box factory, his pathologically shy sister Laura, and  his mother Amanda, who still thinks herself a young woman. The play is  quite depressing and, unlike many others, does not have a happy ending. The  projector seems to be a wonderful device for conveying the characters'  thoughts. The sets is also wonderfully constructed, leaving much to the  imagination while conveying the overall sense. I would also recommend  watching the film (with Paul Newman), which is near-perfect.	2000-03-25

Two low-level adventures are provided in  complete detail (with CD support, which I did not find too useful), but the  prize catch in this set is the enormous volume of Karameikos history,  language, and culture, which completely describes the minute details of the  this Kingdom in the Known World.

After acquainting myself further  with The Kingless Land, I realized that despite Ed's best attempts to tear  away from his old way of writing, he spent simply too much time exploring  Faerun with TSR. His style of writing lacks deep meaning (at least in my  opinion), and his  unability to produce twists in his work is simply  discouraging. The Kingless Land may be a solid fantasy novel with a  tried-and-true plot, but if you've read much of the author's previous  books, you will immediately see that this is merely his old FR theme in  flimsy disguise.	2000-03-18

This book lists nations on one-by-one basis, dealing with each in an extremely limited way (listings include only the basic geography,  customs, army size, and major sites. No maps of any sort are included for  the small-scale locations, although they would be appreciated). Further on,  the world history is dealt with on an event-by-event basis, leading to a  section describing the current status of all things. The listings are quite  disorganized and can be quite confusing, and while they provide some amount  of flavor to the campaign, most of the data is generic (and unnecessary)  filler.<br />This handbook is not the most useful or interesting. Either buy  one of the more specific works, or use your imagination.	2000-03-11

Also included a random  ludicrously lethal trap generation table (walls that stick to characters  and result in death, spoons that spout flames, tables that switch  personalities with the PC, etc.). The discussion of dungeon ecosystems is  limited to a few lines that give just a few broad tips (&quot;creatures  need food&quot;), and reasons for dungeons to be inhabited in the first  place are very unoriginal and uninspiring. Perhaps the only good part of  this book is the listing of special features found in different dungeons,  but those are merely trappings placed there to cover the lack of things to  write.<br />If I were a beginning DM, I would have two options besides buying  this book - a)randomly letting my pencil run over paper to create a random  dungeon; and b)buying a boxed adventure, which is ready with planned  encounters and some sort of story.	2000-03-11

Despite the fact that several portions of the book are strictly D&amp;D rules (such as the classes, specifically Elves,  Dwarves, and Halflings), most of the remaining materials can be easily  adapted to any version of AD&amp;D, and in most cases the DM will benefit  from doing so. This book covers in near-completion such viable topics as  the specifics of combat, such as non-lethal weapons combat, special  maneuvers (set lance versus charge), and weapons mastery and training,  higher levels and the trappings that come with the rank (castles,  followers, assistants), and quite extensive listings of very interesting  monsters, most of which were never seen in any other place again (among  which there are several truly alien extraplanars and a few utility  creatures).<br />Best of all, this book presents all of these necessary rules  in an easy and comprehensive form that does not destroy the original rules  in favor of new ones.

Just finished the review below...since when an erratum for every card was good? Errata are the behind-the-scenes changes in the rules - how is that good? It only complicates the game. Also, I've noticed that with every  volume the amount of info steadily decreases:the first volume held images  of well over 2000 cards from Third and Fourth Ed., Arabian Nights,  Antiquities, Legends, Ice Age, The Dark, Fallen Empires, Alliances, and who  knows what else. It was jam packed with an out-of-order chronology, the  banned cards, lots of strats and card info. The second volume was thirty  percent smaller - 1300 cards from Weatherlight, Visions, Fifth Ed., and  Portal. It was bleaker, smaller, less enthralling. Now, THIS volume  features 900 cards from four small expansions - they didn't even wait for  the block to be over. Some of illustrations are botched or ill-colored, and  the text on the best cards...

It reads exactly like Webster's Unabridged sounds in audiobook format. The art  looks great [in places], but for most of the time it looks as if the paint  was covered with several layers of fine dust. Some sort of organization  would have also helped this dying wonder - unless you are trying to read  this unwieldy 1.5'x1' tome cover to cover, you will have no chance of  finding a specific dragon reference. At the very least, they should have  organized them into Legends and Modern Fiction. The plot, as mentioned  earlier, is a true monster: a young man stumbles to Anne's house crying  that he has trouble with dragons. Next follows a tea party that goes on for  three days, after which the young man leads the group to a dragon's lair  under his house. Abominable.<br />This thin and yet monstrously oversized  volume tore gashes in my skin with its razor-sharp corners, and bludgeoned  my brain with its senseless organization. There are numerous, if highly  superior, histories of mythical creatures, unfortunately most out of print  (however, most can  be found in libraries).

Magic Kingdom for Sale - Sold! delivers nothing new and presents very little originality. Add to that the fact that the key point of the plot -of one escaping from the drudgery of the daily world to face unsurmountable  problems in a magical land of fantasy - is heavily overused, and on your  hands you will have the book that draws on forever.<br />At least that was my  impression of this. Most surprising of all is the total lack of any sort of  originality. The book takes a mileau approach - a sort of &quot;see the  world&quot; - but given that there is nothing for our pithy  lawyer-turned-monarch to see... well, you understand. None of the societies  are explored in any sort of depth, all being summarized by a few  predictable passages. Despite the fact that the book centers singularly on  the ventures of five people (the classic bumbling wizard, the classic  mindless person from a different world, the classic pretty lady, and the  classic knowledgeable-type), I found only one meaningful relationship going  on in the book, and even that was dealt with quite clumsily - Brooks seems  to overemphasize, even overstate his points.<br />There is a number of similar  books that handle the concept better.	2000-03-01

Brooks made the  central character so unnaturally stupid that it's VERY hard to associate,  moreover sympathise. I realized the true answer long before Ben (which is  perhaps the single important thing to avoid when reading a mystery story),  and soon the story collapsed altogether. Most of the book focuses on  uneventful episodes in the separate quests of several of the characters,  which seem to go on forever. Surprisingly enough, I never found the key  villain to be in any way threatening. The dragon, yes, Nightshade,  moderately, but not Meeks. The book follows the same episodic style of the  previous volume, only this time the unoriginality is even more noticeable  and irritating.<br />Perhaps this book is necessary for those who want to  follow the series, but, certainly, this is not the most interesting one.	2000-03-01
US	50899460	R19161UROK2WAX	0812509250	4976316	Xenocide: Volume Three of the Ender Quintet	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Quality of the writing is still suffering	Surprisingly enough, Xenocide proved to be of a bit higher quality than Speaker for the Dead. While Card still manages to ignore his gift of characterization, the plot proves to be original enough to somehow keep the  book on steam. In my opinion, Card's biggest flaw with Xenocide is  practically ignoring the 30-year gap between the last volume and this one -  it is barely dealt with. Furthermore, while all the characters (except  Miro) have aged that amount of time, Card very rarely plays upon that. They  still speak, behave, and move like they are the children of Speaker for the  Dead, and when their ages are mentioned I felt somehow cheated. Whenever  they are mentioned, instead of active, eye-catching personas they become  slow-witted dewy familymen and familywomen Nowhere to be found is the  general life expectancy for the humans - I didn't find Ender to appear any  older than in the previous book. <br />Also, some of the conflict is a bit  contrived - why does Novinha loathe Ender so much, even after thirty years  of marriage? Similarly, Card shows that his way of dealing with problems in  his own writings is to ignore them - didn't he write that Jane was the one  to alert the Congress about the cultural exchange between the species? Are  we to forget that? Most plot twists seem to be thought of on the spot.  <br />Returning to the characters, I found them to be quite a disappointment.  They are just so uniform in their whining and squabbling, I just felt a  great urge to reach into the book and just try to put them to some use.  Nowhere to be found is Ender's mind-boggling intelligence or inter-personal  wisdom. Is he becoming senile? What attracted readers to Game and Shadow  was that all of the characters displayed amazing intelligence - those who  thought themselves as intelligent finally found someone to identify with,  and those who thought the characters to be above them found great role  models. Most of all, the characters were children. Here we have squabbling,  inefficient, and quite unintelligent adults who cook up off-the-wall things  in their minds. The narrative is enthralling, but where is it coming from?  Not the characters, for certain.<br />Lastly, the only original and fresh  characters in the book seem to the inhabitants of the Taoist world of Path,  where the gifted citizens are invariable hampered with OCD (which is  interpreted as hearing the Gods' will), but the way in which they are tied  to the rest of the story seems to be a bit clunky.<br />The theories and the  theology are certainly unique - if only they could make the book that much  better. Alas, they do not.<br />Xenocide proved to be a certain improvement  upon the Speaker for the Dead, but it is still miles below the quality of  either the Game or the Shadow.	2000-02-26

Several months after acquiring the book I leaf through it and wonder how I could have given it such a high rating as I did. It has flaws throughout! <br />- The book appears to have a drastic shortage of species to  list - it is only half as thick as Simon and Schuster's Encyclopedia of  Animals - despite the fact that on numerous occasions they list but one or  two species from a thirty-species family;<br />- The art is severely degraded  from the above mentioned encyclopedia of animals. While I can see the  puzzlement concerning the colors of the creatures' hides, there is no  excuse for the the sloppy drawings of several of the animals!  If you make  a conjecture, please, be sure to follow through!  On several of the animals  the hair cover fails to obey the laws of physics, and most of the  amphibians look like a horrid joke.<br />- The information is sketchy at best  - on numerous occasions special biological mechanisms are mentioned (like a  new jaw bone arrangement for the fishes, and the skull structures of the  early land animals), yet are never explained in function. Almost all  species are captioned with the basics like weight and dimensions followed  with senseless filler.<br />- The between-section class summarizations and the  cladistic graphs are also very, very basic. While I understand that the  book was not intended for specialists, even the basic layman will find the  charts a bit &quot;dumbed down&quot;.<br />This book is flashy and artful, but  lacking, lacking a great lot.	2000-02-23

His four equal sides (irregulars are always killed or imprisoned due  to the confusion of recognizing an irregular figure from looking at its  side) give him the status of lawyer (the number of sides denotes the social  rank). His amazing visions and visitation give this flat and narrow-minded  individual the understanding of the worlds outside his own.<br />First is the  visit to Line Land, where all persons are lines of different lengths and  vision is limited to a single spot. Naturally, bypassing anyone is a  geometric impossibility, but, strangely, the denizens of that land live  happy lives.<br />Next is the visit of mysterious Lord Sphere, who, due to the  lack of dimensionality, has to resort to manifesting himself as his  cross-sections which the square can see. He delivers to the Square the  Gospel of Three Dimensions, and, when the complacent Square refuses to  comprehend, Spherer pulls him out into 3D (i.e. puts him at an angle to his  own flat space).<br />Finally, we are given a view of Point Land, inhabited by  but a single creature of no dimensions and no coprehension of others beside  it, hearing all and attributing all to its own grace and might.<br />The book  is extremely sarcastic and acidic: a 2D woman is a straight line, invisible  when seen head on ( and lethal if met headfirst due to her sharpness), and  is always reduced to constantly emit her Peace Cry. Color is forbidden  because it causes too much confusion. Criminals are those whose sides are  not equal. Etc. etc., etc.<br />Read this book and stop to thinkfrom time to  time - this is the sort of book that rewards thought.	2000-02-19

Perhaps you are tempted to press it twice. Perhaps you will also be tempted to read what I have to say. Speaker  is a good book, but it fails in many areas. First of all, if you hoped for  this book to pick up where the Game left off, or at least feature  comparable characters, you wil be bitterly disappointed. The original  Ender, the boy genius, one who single-handedly destroyed an entire race, is  gone. He is replied with a Speaker for the Dead, one who tells the truth  about the lives of the deceased, hopping from world to world at  relativistic speeds, whittling away at millennia without aging. Although  now he doesn't use the name Ender as the entier universe hates the one who  destroyed the only other race ever known to man. A new world is discovered,  and with it - the piggies, a mysterious primitive race. A settlement is set  up, and a non-interference policy is passed, but lives once again are lost,  and the world is too mysterious to comprehend - or so it seems. Only eight  species in the entier world, and a devious plague virus. Sounds deep? It  is. But Card fails to center on what he does best - characterization.  Characters are limited to a few heart-tugging scenes of broken hearts and  shattered dreams. Sure, the mystery of the aliens is great, but I guessed  the answer midway through the book, and soon realized that the mystery was  the only thing powering the story - once that was gone the book lost all  value. Likewise, there aren't enough relationships with the first book  besides a few reminescences into the past, so you could at least relate to  the characters as they were in the original, but that isn't there  either.<br />This book is good but does not live up to the expectations, and  neither is this Card at its best. Read this book once - there is no prize  for re-reading it like there was in the Ender's Game or Ender's Shadow.	2000-02-16

Also, while the original game concentrated on making the magic system as far from  spell-point system as possible, this is exactly what psionics is: a  point-based system of magic - you get a numbered rating of exactly how much  psionic havoc you can unleash.<br />While the book is undoubtedly well-done  and very professional in appearance, some of the powers seem to be a bit  too powerful for the game's balance. The class of psionicists itself is  perhaps the most powerful class at the high end of the clasial spectrum,  and unlike its wizardly counterpart, who start out with barely any power  (yes, I am comparing wizards to psionicists), mindpower users begin with an  already considerable arsenal.

The  &quot;alphabet&quot; in the beginning barely begins to cover a small  portion of the Egyptian monophonics, and the hieroglyphs that ARE shown are  merely noted for one or two of their multi-faceted meanings, rather than  revealing the leading concept of the symbol.

Usually books that feature full-page close-up photos are merely trying to mask their appaling lack of essense. Not so with the Egyptian Treasures - it is an excellent (albeit a bit too pricy) compilation of egyptian art and  artifacts from all eras - from pre-dynastic to Roman. Although a full  chronology would have helped greately (or if the images were arranged in  order of decreasing age), the images easily offset this moderately annoying  error. However, like noted above, the book is a pleasure for the brain as  well as the eyes - almost all objects are accompinied with a brief  description and  historic data (somewhat like the Simon and Schuster's  Encyclopedia series). I find that another thing which would have helped  greately would be the listing of where exactly this each object was found  (site/room number/quadrant), just because the Archaeological Catalogue  Number Listings isn't always the most convenient thing underhand. As a  resource book of what the humanity is capable of creating, or just what the  Egyptians managed to do within their 3000-odd years, this is an excellent  work.

The character names are as generic  as they can possibly be (Prince John saves Princess Mary). Likewise, the  choice of villains is puzzling at best - why choose a classic witch that  never did any major harm but steal a few children (Baba Yaga is moderately  comparable to a forest hag) when the tales offer a much richer array with  more ambitions with an epic scope- the undead lord Kashchei the Deathless,  the Nightingale Marauder, and numerous others?<br />From a plot side of the  book I likewise consider this to be one of Card's lesser successes: some  readers may be... turned away at his graphic portrayals (just like they  were in Ender's Shadow, where Card used the intensity of bowel movements as  his tool) of various aspects.

Likely this book will sever the personal link between  you and the characters of the book, making them just regular people you  meet, rather that close friends.	2000-01-22

Otherwise it is barely  useful as a creation engine for dull dungeons. The monster cards are only  the basicmost ones from the Monstrous Manual, without the imprtant stats at  that, the Magic Items cards have more gold than magical items, and those  that are there are unusable in AD&amp;D. And, of course, the dungeon design  cards are only marginally useful for creating one color dungeons where all  rooms are all the same.	2000-01-19

The Monstrous Compendium Annuals are basically digests of all the best creatures in that year's adventures and magazines. In this way, the appendices can be seen as expansions for  the MM, unless you plan to buy every single adventure TSR produces. One of  the largest problems with the appendices is the fact that they frequently  re-release creatures from books that are still in print, but with revised  statistics, causing major havoc and confusion. Also, it appears that these  books were not proofread at all, as the text in several places resorts to a  jumble of senseless words stringed together with no punctuation, making  hard it under- reading you stand what are.<br />Below are the separate ratings  for each volume of the appendices:<br />1st - published in 1994, contains  creatures of 1993. The only appendix with a white cover,also the largest.  This little guy contains monsters in the very same format as the Monsteous  Manual, which is very relaxing. Most of the monsters are interesting and a  large part are actually useful in day-to-day campaigning. Highlights  include the new Linnorm dragons and the low-level outerplanar creatures.  Five stars.<br />2nd - Released in 1995, contains 1994 materials. in this  volume the creatures aren't framed but sprawl around the pages in a variety  of places and positions. Although this could cause some wprd-wrap problems  like in the Planescape MC's, it doesn't seem to do it too much.  Nevertheless, a change from the routine is not all too bad. Most of the  monsters are vibrant and colorful, but lighter than the ones in #1 (  perhaps because Tony DiTerlizzi is not the artist, but does that make such  a big difference! ). I enjoyed the Chronolily, but the centaur sub-species  are rip-offs. Four stars.<br />3rd - released either in 1996 or 1997, contains  monsters of '95, '96 ( or at least I think so). I don't own this one, so I  can't tell you too much. It seems though, that TSR skipped a year  somewhere.<br />4th - TSR is cleaning up its case. Released in 1998, contains  1997 materials. Many old creatures making a comeback. Art is extremely  beautiful, and the fact that it is done by a variety of artists only  swwetens the candy. Finally TSR agreed to publish the sources of the  creatures in the book. This is the last one in print.<br />Basically, this is  where you turn for creatures after you exhausted the MM. If you think you  can bypass the spelling and the syntax problems, you will enjoy these.leaning up its case. Released in 1998, contains  1997 materials. Many old creatures making a comeback.

This book takes AD&amp;D too far for it to handle the situation properly. Each of the rules is tweaked to such absurd degree that I at times lost all recognition of what exactly I was reading. Unlike Skills and Powers which  expands on the previuosly available data, Combat and Tactics adds far too  much of the new and the unexpected. The mix of the combat rules is almost  intolerable if you know of a game that used these rules first. It is as if  TSR is trying to capture the popularity of other games by mimicking them.  On the other hand, Combat and Tactics contains many useful materials - the  much-needed  critical hits table which allows for detailed damage, updated  weapons tables ( sadly, these are less extensive than those in the Arms and  Equipment), and several interesting variants of the initiative rules are  explained in greater completion than they are in PHB or the DMG. But by the  time the book is finished you will feel that now the combat is too drawn  out and it becomes so much more of a chore - nothing of the elegant  simplicity of the original rules. My advice - give Combat and Tactics a  try, borrow it from a friend, copy the tables into your little notes  folder, and use your judgement during combat.	2000-01-08

While this is easily the least useful volume of the Planescape Appendices ( one containing the Baatezu and the Tanar'ri, three focusing on the Elementals), Number Two readily catches my eye with the fact that most of  the creatures within have never apeared in print before, and the few that  have haven't been heard from in many years (on the other hand, numbers one  and three usually simply take a random, and probably well-known creature  from one of the older supplements, change its stats and name, and - voila!  - a &quot;new&quot; monster!). I find this volume to be a most enjoyable  resource of absurd creatures I use to knock the ground from under my PCs'  feet.	2000-01-08

While we are all happy and joyous about the Lammasus, the Kuo-Toa, and the ever-present kobolds in the Monstrous Manuals and  Appendices, nothing holds our attention ( whether out of disgust or out of  simple curiosity) quite like the alien Mind Flayers. These demi-cephalopods  are too alien in nature to stay flat on the page. This is where the  Illithiad comes in: it gives us the full scope of the bizzarre Illithid(  the second name of the Mind Flayer race) society, allowing us to construct  all-the-more bizzarre adventures based on this strange culture. The text  deals with all possible aspects of the species; biological as well as  social deatails are covered with surprising originality. The wording is as  scientificly plausible as it is possible in an RPG ( i.e. you will never  read a sentence like &quot; the Illithid heart is just like a human's -  six-chambered and green&quot;). The material as well as the subject matter  is most enjoyable and is highly recommended to those who enjoy Twilight  Zone-style gaming.	2000-01-08

If you want to govern a Viking-esque campaign, I would advise you to get several books on Norse history and literature, but not this God-awful thing. The culture is presented in such a quaint way  that unless I knew that the mediocrity was TSR's fault, I could swear that  the Vikings led the most tedious lives in the world. The rune magic system  is unwieldy and repulsive ( indeed, the only time I remember it being  called upon is the fact that it is used by the Ice Linnorm dragons from the  First Annual Compendium Appendix). Use your imagination rather than falling  into this out-of-stock trap.	2000-01-08

While this is basically a second take  on The Complete Wizard's Handbook, it accomplished its goals so much better  and quicker that it has plenty of leftover space to introduce several new  subdivisions of the magic-user class and many other useful innovations. My  advise as for Spells and Magic? Opt for this rules expansion - steer clear  of its comrades.	2000-01-08

Under the masterfully constructed veil of a scenario you will  see a dungeon crawl worthy of a god. Although this is no Descent to  Undermountain, I admit this adventure to be on equal level with most  revered adventures in AD&amp;D history. While I don't feel too much joy  over the gratuitous levels of violence this run has, the devils are finally  what they are supposed to be. Truly, the earlier visits to hell and other  planes have almost given me the impression that it takes no wits to outwit  the Duke of Hell himself ( the Monstrous Manual of '89 merely gives him a  column of stats and five lines of flavor text, three of them relating to  his Ruby Wand). Paladin in Hell is as hard to complete in its true form as  it is to hand-paint the roof of the Capitol. Expect plenty of dead, dying,  amost dead, and undead characters ( it's Hell, so if you die your soul is  still there). Although if you buy Paladin in Hell it only gives you enough  fun for playing through once, I advise you buy it ( if, of course, you  planned to buy it in the first place) long before your PCs attain the level  necessary to survive there. Use it to scare them when they become too  unruly - it wil get them back in line for sure.	2000-01-08

I published several books concerning the numerous evils that the modern culture has spawned upon the world - among them &quot; The Truth About Dungeons and Dragons&quot; and &quot; The  Truth About Ninja Turtles&quot;. In my books I argue with foam at the mouth  for the recognition of the fact that larger-than-life imaginary characters  are completely and irreparably evil. If you ever dream of accomplishing  something heroic - you're out of luck - hell awaits you  eagerly.&quot;<br />I'm terrifyingly sorry about the bile-flavoured sarcasm I  was forced to resort to, but that is the only fitting way to review a true  work of art The Truth About Dungeons and Dragons is. This is the one most  single-minded, obscene, aggravating, unresearched, paranoid, and  fanatic  book commercially available. If you stick by your beliefs that AD&amp;D is  pure evil - feel free to dissociate yourself from any and all who play this  game. In my opinion, true beleivers don't need to shove their beliefs down  someone else's gullet.	2000-01-08

As far as I know, it is no more than two years old, and it's still fully viable on the webs ( heck, even Amazon carries a large selection of all things  Birthright!). Nevertheless, Birthright is a unique setting, and it can be  easily enjoyed. This book is a very good work on the nature of priestcraft  in the world where this campaign is set ( and if it IS killed off, I advise  you to get it quickly - out of print products don't linger too long on this  site). It is also a very good work of AD&amp;D priestcraft in general, and  although it isn't as likely to help players as it will help DMs, but take  my word - this book will ease the life of DMs immensely (remember that  player whose priest would constantly stop to cast healing spells on  everyone?

AD&amp;D stands  for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons - dragons for the greatest creatures to  ever roam our fantasies and dungeons where all sorts of fantasy games  started( and where this particular package puts you). The game is played as  a sort of collective fantasy - role playing. You make a character, someone  prepairs your adventures and you explore. You can't possibly run out of  ideas for the game - if you noticed Amazon carries some 700 items on the  topic.

The book makes this ( seemingly) boredom-laden plane of  existense as enchanting and dangerous as any other part of the AD&amp;D  cosmology. For those who are tired of putting their characters through Hell  ( literally), the Ethereal is a nice change from the routine. It has a lot  more possibilities in it than you think.

Although I doubt that a DM without the Munchkin syndrome can lead several PC to such apexes of power without getting a few clues on how to run the campaign, the high level campaigns has several very good guiding lights for  those DMs that have strayed into the darkness and can't get out (  overpowerful items, characters, and other forms of blight). This should  have included some type of section dealing with STRIPPING overly mighty  characters of their powers within the bounds of rational role-playing.  Overall, I find that some sections of this book should have actually been  included in the basic rules several years ago, rather than be used as a  leaky life-boat for a dying game.

Giving powers to specialty priests is  not the hard part - the hard part is putting the motives behind the gods,  at which I can't say this book succeeds too well.

It's a first-generation fantasy pencil-and-paper RPG, created back in 1979 by Ken St. Andre from a simplified set of Dungeons and Dragons rules. This  is a great classic, unique in the way that it is incredibly simple and easy  to learn. The rules are readily grasped, but not simplistic. What Tunnels  and Trolls is actually famous for is not the group play ( which is far from  the quality expected at an average AD&amp;D session - the rules are far too  simple to handle non-dungeon settings), but the series of solo adventure  books that allow players to play without a gamemaster. The game is very fun  and addictive. It is built around the old-fashioned concept of  hack-and-slash ( perhaps some would like to comment that hack-and-slash is  not role-playing. You are wrong.). This is the single thing that the game  handles well, but it handles it exceedingly well. The game hasn't changed  much since it was created, and has its own little circle of followers. This  is an instant favorite and an old classic. Try it out.	1999-12-29

This book will not be of any use to you if you think it will help  your campaign. It was never intended for this. Rather, treat it like a book  of fairy tales ( not the ones to be told to children). Use the book for the  spirit of fantasy, the dark tales that are whispered in none but the  softest of voices, the forgotten names of fell powers uttered by none but  the most powerful of sages, and even then fearfully. Like it was said  below, you cannot possibly hope to thoughfully use all of the artifacts  gathered in this tome.<br />3.

Surprisingly, the settings, cultures, and characters are fresh and  lifelike, despite the system's overall age ( 25 years). Some of the areas  haven't been described in optimal detail, but perhaps this is best for  those who want to be able to expand upon store-bought accessories. This  campaign is very interesting, with many things going for it, albeit it is  somewhat taxing on the role-playing abilities of some beginners.	1999-12-27

Skullport is the perfect place to be used by a fiendish DM or anyone looking for trouble. This place is lovely in a unique sort of way: the concept is pulled off masterfully and is very well thought  out. The text is good but not so full as to stifle any hope of DM  creativity ( which means you can glue bits and pieces of Skullport to your  own home-made campaign). The graphics are dark and moody. One thing I can  gripe at is the unstable binding for the books and booklets, which will  fall apart easily. Also, as it is, Skullport is an awfully small place to  forever wander, and as your players at some point will wander out of it  (probably sooner than later), I don't see this one being replayed too  often. Buy it if you like this sort of  thing.	1999-12-27

Probably it's a grave mistake on my part to make that the firt sentense of a review, but still. I daresay, anyone who has ever been in the very least intereste in paleontology has  always longed for this sort of tome. The authors have satisfied both our  love of visuals ( pictures are abundant - they accompiny every entry, in  full blazing color by very trustworthy artists, generally sure to catch  anyone's eye) and our love of the unknown ( this is the first  non-specialist book that I have seen that goes beyond the everyday banal  creatures like the pachycephalosaurus and the pterosaurids). This book is  sheer pleasure while doing any sort of research, even for the specialists  who need solid information. Perhaps there isn't quite enough data with  every entry ( due to page limits), but the information that is included is  accurate and up-to-date. This is a very good book.	1999-12-27

It has been done to magical items, artifacts, wizard spells, and now - priest spells. I don't see how one can  argue against this book: all the spells are copied correctly , with no  changes from their original entries ( sources are quoted, as always). It's  an incredible thing to own a gathering of spells where you can just flip  through the pages and pick a spell instead of going through tons of useless  materials.  Also, the format is great - &quot;Tome&quot; look is very  soulful. I also enjoyed the notacion and the font, both of which are very  good and readable.	1999-12-22

As far as I am concerned, this is one of the best &quot;monster books&quot; in existense in the AD&amp;D game. The art is fresh and vibrant ( unlike the washed-out art of Planescape appendixes), the creatures are  creative and each and every one of them is capable of having an entire  adventure centered on it and it alone. A few things - the spelling is  horrible; the binding is simple glue spread - the book falls apart easily  with time; also, the text isn't as enchanting as it used to be...<br />This is  one of the best, and I consider it a near must-have.	1999-12-18

Accurately worded and incredibly well-written, this  book inquires into the very function of cities in human civilization, their  influence on local life, etc. Bound to prove an awesome source of general  data as well as the specifics, this book is a major work and is a certain  must-have.	1999-12-11

When I see a new guidebook for a fighting game of any sort, my heart fills with dread. Fighting games are as much of an art as the martial arts themselves, and guidebooks for such shuld be, nay, OUGHT to be perfect.  Every combination for every move must be entered correctly, and if any  moves are pictured, the frames must be clean, understandable, and  large.<br />The guidebook for Bushido Blade has none of these qualities. The  offered material is of the kind most often found in the game's own  instructional booklet, frequently misquoted at that. The moves are  sometimes entered for the incorrect characters ( I imagine that numerous  gamers will go mad while trying to perform a move that doesn't exist).  Picture frames are often misplaced and smudged, defeating the entire  purpose of their existense. For a game of such finesse as Bushido Blade II,  Prima's guide does little to fill in the fine points of combat. Strategies  that are given are often basic enough to be guessed. The information about  the storyline, character background info and statistics, and other  interesting and quirky data is contradictory and mostly useless.<br />I can  freely say that it is easier to master the game WITHOUT this guide, rather  than with it.	1999-12-11

This book is the one that proved that good visuals do matter in history books. Arms and Armor of the Medieval Knight has it all: types of armor, weapons, historic data of where and when the  weapon was used... but most important of all , VISUALS!  Hundreds upon  hundreds of page-size, full color photos of actual suits of armor, not  crude drawings and diagrams that other books on the subject offer.<br />Also,  I have to say that the texts is incredibly well-written an precise, the  data is vast and accurate, and all the sources are quoted perfectly. This  is the definitive book on the subject.	1999-12-11

Castles and Fortresses in clearly written and the text is supported  with glorious photographs and diagrams. An absolute-must have for anyone  researching or just interested in the subject. Accept no substitutes.	1999-12-11

I simply own the book, and I have the right to say that there is nothing wrong with it. I've noticed people complaining that the author doesn't keep up with science, is biased  against Star Trek, gives nonsemsial info in order to confuse you,  etc.<br />This is not true. Moreover, that is not what the book is for. The  author encourages you, gives you examples, and makes you comfortable with  writing fiction. Card doesn't give you specific advice ( insert character A  here). He gives you examples of tone. He doesn't give you a compendium of  data on the medieval world. He shows you what it feels like to write about  it. He points you in the right direction, gives personal pointers, uses  fine humor. You supply your own storylines. Enjoy this book.	1999-12-09

Wow! <br />All I can say is........WOW!  This is the treasure trove of the unique, original, and inspiring creatures I have always longed for... The art is amazing, the text is well-written, the book is sturdy and very  attractive, and the content is....... simply put, oustanding. This is a  sort of book that you lift up and say &quot; why haven't I heard of this  earlier! &quot; or &quot; why haven't they released this a couple years  ago! &quot;. Every single creature is so original and unique, they fully  deserve to have legends written about them. BUY THIS BOOK!	1999-12-04

These sheets are very handy for recording basically anything about the player characters in your game. Blanks are included for all aspects of the characters, and there is plenty of room for any miscelaneous  information.<br />Although there are many other equally good ( and,  furthermore, free) character record sheets on the nets, buy this if you  like company-sanctioned materials or just want a bit more reliability.	1999-12-04
US	50899460	RR32JK4RHG19X	0786903287	882828262	Dungeon Master Guide (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, 2nd Edition, Core Rulebook/2160)	Books	4	35	44	N	N	The start for any aspiring Dungeon Master	This book is the newest edition of the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master's Guide. As it is one of the three &quot;core books&quot;, i.e. ones that contain the general rules, it is required reading for the  DM. This release has its faults and its good sides. <br />Like all three core  books ( Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and the Monstrous  Manual) that were reprinted in 1995, this volume is expanded from the  previous editions. It has many more pages that before, many with color  illustrations. The font is larger and easier to read. <br />As a manual for  creating realism in the adventures you create, the Guide does succeed,  although not everywhere. Nearly every rule is followed by good sketches,  tables, and graphs for easy reference. New situations are detailed, and  there is a generous sprinkling of optional rules for enhanced realism.  Despite this, some of the shady areas have been left only partially  explained ( large-scale travel, for example). The book is written with  good-natured humor, and is by itself fine reading. Also, I would like to  commend on the  lists of magical and arcane items. <br />The book is the  required start for any DM, and it reamins the necessary component of any  game session. Buy it, but never show it to your players.	1999-12-04

This is a packaged adventure, it comes in a shrink-wrapped cardboard box, and itself contains numerous booklets and maps. There. Having said that...<br />The Accursed Tower  is a good Advanced Dungeons and Dragons adventure set in the  fantasy world  of Faerun, where the Forgotten Realms setting is placed. This is a classic  fantasy world in the best tradition of Tolkien. I won't spoil the fun for  you by telling what the adventure is about, but it does a very good job at  showing your players the basics of the campaign world. The terrain maps are  wonderfully understandable, and even the cave maps detailing 3D areas can  be read without too much strain. The adventure is easy to build upon, which  cannot be said about a great many others. Try it.	1999-12-04

The book accomplishes its goal amazingly well with clear graphics, lucid text, and wonderful accuracy  . Easily the best in its field, the book gives you a profound understanding and knowledge of the european wars. The  chapters are well written and up-to-date. The bibliographies are clearly  stated to give the reader further information on a given topic. This is  history of war at its finest.	1999-11-27
US	50899460	R1TBV13UJZFWPA	1560766190	110712796	Monstrous Manual (AD&D 2nd Ed Fantasy Roleplaying Accessory, 2140)	Books	4	41	43	N	N	The required start for any beginner	This book is one of the core 3 books of the second edition AD&amp;D, and as such it is required material for any dungeon master and very useful reading for beginning players. In the reviews below you can read about  several good and bad things with this book, and they are summarized  below:<br />a) content - the book contains the necessary basics for any game -  orcs, goblins and the like. It also contains several offbeat monsters (  lammasu, giff) you could spinkle on top of your campaign if you like the  sort of thing, and, finally, it contains a few useless super-powerful  monsters that are there simply for the &quot;wow factor&quot; , such as the  Tarrasque, tanar'ri, and other exotica. Of course by the time you can use  those monstrosities you'll own many more volumes detailing the creatures of  the multiverse. In any case, once you are past being interested in simple  everyday kobolds, you should buy a different version of the manual or some  of the annual compendiums.<br />b) format - I personally have nothing against  book format. It's easier to use, it is more permanent in nature, and is  much sturdier than the 3-ring binder pages, which were last released a long  time ago and will never probably find their way into the mainstream again  in the future.<br />c) usability - as far as I am concerned, the book is  usable by the most of us. It could be better, but it is fine as it is, and  the information is as expansive as could be published in the book's pages.  Language is not too esoteric and the book by itself is fine reading.<br />Buy  it as it is required. Move on later when you want more.	1999-11-27
