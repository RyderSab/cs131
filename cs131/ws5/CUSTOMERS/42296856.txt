Although i can't agree with the author on all his opinions, as he seems to be against the modernization of Asia, i do agree that with the modernization there is a great loss of knowledge of nature.  The author seems to have a love/hate thing going with china, doesn't seem to keen on thailand, and seems sad at the loss of how burma used to be.  The book is well written and gives some great anecdotal history of asia, as well as illustrates, in part, the difference in the asian mindset when it comes to fortune tellers and magic.	2005-03-13

Some parts became very dry and academic, and it felt like something was missing, as if his heart wasn't fully in this book.  He introduces the five main reasons we feel anxious about our status in life, then gives five solutions to dealing with the anxiety, however, at times it seems he is reaching for causes or solutions.  There were some good points made, and he uses enough history, art, and poetry to make his points, which add to the fullness of the book, but it still seemed, at times, a bit contrived.  i liked the book and enjoyed it, it shed some light on why we act the way we do and it was entertaining and well written.  i just think it wasn't up to par compared to his previoius books.	2005-01-05

Wheelan writes with humor and his enthusiasm for the subject comes through.  it is in no way a dry book, he actually makes economics interesting.  i would reccommend this book to anyone interested in learning basic economic principles.	2004-10-23

HOWEVER, if you are easily offended or just prefer not to read books that include off color topics such as pederast priests, deviant sexual content, and liberal use of profanity, this book is not for you.  the book is extremely vulgar, but almost in a cartoonish way.  the vulgarity and profanity are more of a spice that adds flavor than the main ingrediant.  if you can read past the explicit scenes and enjoy the story for the story, and appreciate the way the words themselves are used, you will enjoy every moment of this book.  i consider this book true literature.  i loved it, but i know this book isn't for everyone.	2004-10-07

Also, there is a little puzzle within the book for you to solve, which adds another \\"cool\\" facet to the book.  It's a quick read, and although it's a childrens lit book, it wasn't dumbed down. Overall i liked it.  It is well written, interesting, and makes me want to learn a bit more about vermeer. i also ended up buying books by Fort.  great light reading.	2004-09-03
