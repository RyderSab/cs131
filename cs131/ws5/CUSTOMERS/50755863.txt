She had no need for friends or employment as long as the wealthy men of Dallas were willing to subsidy her lifestyle. That was before her downfall.  Humiliated and hungry, Jana opens the door of Midnight Dreams and faints.  Luckily for her, Tyler Maxwell and his sister Olivia were there to help her.  Fearing a lawsuit, they took her to the hospital where she was treated by Dr. Julian Cortez.  For Tyler, Jana was a mystery waiting to be solved.  For, Olivia, Jana was a woman in need and she was going to do everything she could to help, including taking her home and hiring her to work in her shop.  For Jana, Olivia proved to be something she had never expected to have,  a true friend and Tyler was a man who wanted her for more than just her body.  The relationship between Jana and the Maxwell siblings is what makes up Francis' Ray newest novel Any Rich Man Will Do.<br /><br />While touted as women's fiction, for this reader this book is another example of why Francis Ray is one of my favorite romance writers. The conflict and resolution were just enough to keep me eagerly turning the pages.  Ms Ray usually includes social issues and during your reading and fantasizing, a lesson is being woven throughout the story. While reading this novel, the store Midnight Dreams had me longing for any linen store that sells Fretti sheets and towels.  If you enjoy glamour and romance, this is the novel for you.<br /><br />Jeanette<br /><br />APOOO BookClub	2005-10-10

In Ivy's Dilemma we meet the women who are apart of the trilogy. Ivy's story is told and the reader gets a glimpse at Jade's story, which is the second book in the trilogy. Author Reign takes a little used subject, what happens to the family when a loved one dies.  Sometimes, death causes family members and friends' true feelings to rise to the surface.  Unfortunately, everyone is not able to get along during times of bereavement and with the Jones-Miller family, even with the power of prayer, things can go from bad to worse.<br /><br />Childhood sweethearts Ivy and Ray Miller had been married for 11 years before Ivy finally got fed up with the Ray's drugging and cheating.  Before she could complete the divorce process, Ray is killed in a car crash and the woman in the car only suffers minor injuries.  Beyond angry, Ivy is ready to put Ray away with only a pauper funeral.  To make matters worse, she has to contend with Ray's mother who dislikes Ivy with a passion.  While in the midst of the planning of the funeral, Ivy is delivered news by Ray's attorney that indicates that Ray really loved her and his hurtful actions were to make her file for divorce to protect her.  Unbeknownst to Ivy, Ray had left her a very wealthy woman.<br /><br />Unfortunately, reading about how the families were fighting after the death of Ray is real.  Somehow death and funerals can bring out the worse in people as the author showed in this book.  While I probably would have liked this book to have less telling and more showing, I was drawn into the story rather quickly and it held my interest until just about the end.  I found the antics at the reading of the will \\"soap operaish\\" and ridiculous.  As a matter of fact, after the reading of the will the novel started to go downhill for me. I just did not think all the over-the-top drama was necessary.  I am interested in Jade's story so I will give the second book a try, hopefully seeing growth in the author's writing as she continues on with the Dilemma series.<br /><br />Jeanette<br /><br />APOOO BookCluby, hopefully seeing growth in the author's writing as she continues on with the Dilemma series.  <br /> <br />Jeanette <br />APOOO BookClub <br />	2005-09-25

The sub title \\"Never Underestimate a Sista's Revenge, \\" indeed tells it all.  Sistas everywhere are finding it hard to meet the perfect man or just a plain old good man. The three sistas in this novel try the ever popular Internet dating.  Seemingly they found a good man in the person of Chauncey.  This man is everything they can hope for. Good looking, honest, physically fit and to top it off he has a British accent.  Chauncey is a massage therapist who gives pamper parties and more all over the United States.  He is currently living with Nicole Harris and her teenage son; dating Janelle Carter the full figured hair salon owner; and sometimes kicking it with newspaper reporter, Arianna Singleton.  When Arianna figures out Chauncey's game, she makes it her mission to warn other women about him and to make him pay for his indiscretions.<br /><br />The story Ms Swan told is not really anything new.  You have three women looking for that special man, become disappointed because he is not what he seems, then seek revenge.  I think she updated the story by using Internet dating as the backdrop.  The method of revenge is definitely a twist.  While the book kept my interest, overall the conclusion was pretty predictable.<br /><br />Jeanette<br /><br />APOOO BookClub	2005-08-06

What could have been a quick bring my daughter home turns into a dangerous adventure for Georgia and the video cowboys.   <br /> <br />I found this book to be funny and was amused by the adventures of the video cowboys and Georgia Barnett. There were parts that had me laughing out loud and other parts that had me on the edge of my seat.  This novel was not a literary masterpiece, nor do I think it was supposed to be, it is a for entertainment purpose read.

Security expert, D. Hunter is hired by Ivy Greenwich, the agent to the stars,  to deliver ransom money to the kidnappers of recording star, Night.  D surmises that this kidnapping is a personal vendetta against Ivy Greenwich and is determined to get to the bottom of the mystery and a Ninja-like motorcycle gang could hold the answer to his questions.  Meanwhile, D is heavily distracted because his fledging security company is hired by Ivy to provide security services for pop star, wannabe hip-hop star, Bridgette Haze. Bridgette represents everything D should be running away from, but the young star has her heart set on being with D. In the midst of providing protection to Bridgette and her entourage. D also has to contend with the motorcycle gang that is out to destroy Ivy Greenwich`s acts.  Slowly and methodically George is able to tie several seemingly unrelated events together to provide the answers to the secret on-goings in the world of securing the rich and famous.   <br /> <br />I did not feel I was reading a mystery.  What I did feel was that I was reading about the ins and outs of D's world of providing security for the late, late night party people.  The action with the motorcycle gang, the nightlife and the antics of Bridgette and her sister supply  excitement to the story.

Just days into the beginning of a brand new year, Sheridan Hart's life is turned upside down when her husband, Quentin makes this statement.  Dealing with her own feelings of shock, disbelief, shame and humiliation, she must relay this news to her children, family and friends.  How will they react? How can she face the church members, friends and family?  Victoria Christopher Murray answers all these questions and more in her latest offering Grown Folks Business.<br /><br />Sheridan Hart is stunned when her supposedly God-fearing Christian husband, Quentin announces that he is gay. It is a secret he has been keeping for many years and has finally decided that he can no longer live a lie.  His announcement makes Sheridan take a look at herself. She has to deal with feelings of inadequacy as a woman and a wife.  How she reacts to Quentin as a Christian is being scrutinized by church members. She gets conflicting responses from friends and family.  She knows what the Word says one ought to do and she has her pastor looking out for her best interest, but she still finds it difficult to take the Christian route. The children, Chris and Tori, have two different extreme reactions.  Sixteen year old Chris refuses to have a relationship with his father and denounces everything in his life prior to his father's coming out.  On the other hand, nine year old Tori is accepting of her father. Unconditional love allows her to maintain a relationship with him and to accept her father's partner. Just barely getting over Quentin's betrayal, another man enters Sheridan's life.  Now, she must decide if having a relationship so soon after her breakup is the right thing to do.<br /><br />My book club had an enlightening discussion regarding the many issues found in Grown Folks Business, foremost being homosexuality, fornication and unconditional love.  We all agreed Victoria is one of the best when it comes to extracting emotions from her readers. Though the consensus was we did not really care for Sheridan as a person, we could empathize with all that she was going through; we cried when she cried and rejoiced when she rejoiced.  Even when Brock entered her life, we could understand her relationship with him.  Initially, I had my doubts when I found out this was one of those \\"my husband is on the down low\\" books, but Victoria took this subject  to another level and really got inside the heart and heads of the characters.

What if you avenge the wrong person?  These are questions that will make you ponder as you read Freddie Lee Johnson's novel, Other Men's Wives.  This novel takes a complex look at love gone wrong, the lack of communication and the ramifications of taking things into your own hands.<br /><br />Sierra Wheeler is the wife of Denmark Wheeler and he loves the ground she walks on.  They have been married for five years.  In these five years, Denmark has been faithful, choosing only to give himself to his wife, even though temptation is rampant.  Nothing could have prepared Denmark for the surprised he received via Federal Express on the day of his anniversary. The surprise sends him spiraling into a rage.  Believing that one of his best friends, either philandering Harry or Gordon is the culprit, he vows to take out his anger and frustration on them.  He plans to seduce their wives and destroy their relationships as his has been destroyed.  His plans also include claiming as many women as he can, cause as the saying goes \\"Misery Loves Company.\\".<br /><br />Denmark, in my opinion was not the most likeable character; however, Johnson did a good job in portraying him as a man with several personas. There is the businessman, regional manager of Speed Shift's Auto Supply, then the thug that climbed out of the Cleveland ghetto, the friend and the enemy.  I found I enjoyed the female characters, Gordon's longsuffering wife, Alice; Harry's drunken spouse, Inez; and the attorney, Hilda. Each of their interactions with Denmark gave the story a different point of view.  The ending was not quite what I expected.  I was intrigued by the suspense and had to keep reading to find out the answers to all my questions.  I thought I had things figured out early on, but was thrown for a loop when things started going in a different direction.

Bertice Berry's writing reminds me a little of Tina McElroy Ansa and Pearl Cleage. I say Ansa because of her use of a voice from the grave, and Cleage for the literary prose and the subject of women being empowered.  Berry's combination of these two styles is what makes this book such an interesting reading experience.<br /><br />Bernita Brown was born to Buster, who was not interested in being a mother; she only has this baby to prove to her sisters that she can get pregnant. Ultimately, Bernita is raised by her aunt Babe who hated her for no apparent reason other than the fact she was living. The hatred she felt from her aunt and mother and witnessing her aunt Babe search for love in the arms of multiple men,  Bernita knew she wanted more for her life.  It was a good thing that a teacher saw the potential in Bernita and arranged for her to go to college. Just like crabs dragging each other back, Buster and Babe beat and berate Bernita for choosing college. Once Bernita leaves the home, she never looks back.  Fortunately, for Bernita, Babe is watching over her from heaven.  Unable to reveal herself to Bernita,  Babe watches as Bernita makes the wrong choice in her relationships with men such as Tyrone Phillip Thomas, Jimmymack, Re Member, and Rev. Evans (Van).  It is apparent that listening is not Bernita's strong suit, because Babe is whispering advice to  her from her heavenly watch. After a devastating exile from the Wellness Center, the church she gave her all for,  Bernita is ready to change her life and Babe finally can reveal herself. Babe has set in motion for Bernita to find her true love, but when love calls, will she answer?<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. I loved how Berry used different  scriptures and old adages, made them common sense and relevant to everyday life.  I also enjoyed the theme of women being empowered and taking a bad situation and using it to their advantage. There are so many aspects of this book to discuss, I cannot put them all in one review.

These women put aside their differences and become prayer warriors for their families, marriages and selves.<br /><br />Yvonne thinks her marriage is fine; she is on fire for the Lord and everything in life is fine.  She is shocked when her husband's secret life comes to the light.  As the victim, she must now be able to forgive her husband for his trespasses.  Pam is struggling to maintain her sanity in her marriage and profession.  Her husband Troy, is  a so-called music producer but is not bringing in an income nor does he help her around the house.  Even when they are blessed financially, Pam still just wants him to give his life to the Lord.  Unfortunately, Pam's nagging and complaining does not give Troy the incentive to want to follow her in her walk with the Lord.  After falling for the sweet talk and promises of one of the ministers in the church, Taylor finds herself pregnant and unmarried .  Although she sees the father of her child and his wife every Sunday, her former lover does not want to have anything to do with either of them.  Pam is prepared to struggle alone until social services makes her name the child's father. Now, her secret is out and all over the church. What is even more horrific is that she has become friendly with the man's wife.<br /><br />The theme for this book is Prayer.  These women face many obstacles from domestic violence, unemployment, serious injury to a spouse and trying to live single and saved.  They find as they seek God and pray, their prayers are answered.  Not always the way they expected or in what they would consider a timely manner, but they know that God's time is not always our time nor does he always give us the answer we want.

While she could not see the bride in the dream, she knows she has three eligible daughters, so one of them has to be the bride.  She makes it her business to marry off one of her daughters in Debra Phillips newest novel, Too Much Drama.<br /><br />Donneeka (Neeka) LaBeau is the oldest of Adeena's daughters; therefore it would make the most sense for Adeena to find her a husband.  The intended groom to be is an old neighbor, Braxton Dupree.  Neeka is outraged at her mother's audacity in planning her life. However,  Neeka and her sisters, Princess and Mercedes are powerless when it comes to their mother.  They all work for her in the family business Diva Four Cosmetic Company.  The condos they live in and the cars they drive are all purchased and paid for by their mother.  In an effort to bring Braxton and Neeka together, Adeena arranges for Neeka to go on a business trip to Texas and hires Braxton to drive her from California to Austin, Texas in a RV.  One thing that Adeena did not count on was Braxton encouraging Neeka to take back control of her life.  Neeka did not count on was being attracted to Braxton.  Upon her return to California, Neeka is a new person, determined to take control over her life and in her quest to do so, reveals a painful secret of her mother's and has to suffer the consequences.<br /><br />Too Much Drama was just that, much drama, however, funny drama that was easy to read and had quite a few laugh out loud moments.  It also showed young ladies trying to empower themselves against strong obstacles.  I thought Adeena LaBeau was a little over the top with her strong religious convictions, picture taking and controlling temperament, but her actions really shaped her daughters' thoughts and behaviors.

Who would ever imagine the infamous motivational speaker would be so unhappy and thinks suicide is the answer?  Jermaine's life is full of tragedy and loss. His two best friends were killed in a car crash over a decade ago.  His parents chose the crack pipe over him and his aunt who raised him is suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

When Candace Clark is hired to write an exclusive article about the great Jermaine Hill, and has to be in his presence constantly for two weeks, Jermaine finds himself falling for the writer.  Unfortunately, lurking behind the scenes is a scandalous reporter set on destroying Jermaine and his agent.  When Jermaine is hospitalized, he is befriended by another patient, Ambrose Rivers, who helps a reluctant Jermaine to realize the call God has on his life.<br /><br />A Man Inspired is a fairly good read.  For this reader, there was too much narrative.  The author did a lot of telling the story.  I wish there had been more dialogue between the characters.  I would have even preferred if Jermaine were talking to himself during those times when he felt he had no one to talk to.

He even gets a surprise visit from the past.  Charles is unable to resist any of them and has the libido to meet all their needs.<br /><br />While an interesting read, this  could have been a very good novel with better editing to help the story flow more evenly and the transitions move smoother.  At times in the same paragraph I would find the storyline had moved on  several days or weeks ahead without warning.  The character Charles was a piece of work, but very one dimensional.  Secondary characters Ms Mildred, Rev. Deeberry and the rest of the Jennings clan provided some  relief from the highly erotic, bordering on pornographic storyline of Charles' bedroom antics. .

I could not connect with any of the characters and found myself not liking any of them. Ashley's obsession with becoming a size 8 and being 45 years old was tiresome.  Aunt Cora and her wig, I am sure was meant to be comic relief, but it was hard to find the humor.  I also found the behavior of the characters inconsistent and unreal.  The only thing that really moved me throughout the whole book was the death of Ashley's father,  Daniel Lake.  For those who read Something In Common, Ms Phillips first novel,  Helen  Graham and Robert Wilbertson make appearances in this book as well.  I have read other books of women changing their lives for the better and really enjoyed them, unfortunately for me, this one fell a little short.<br /><br />Jeanette<br /><br />APOOO BookClubter and really enjoyed them, unfortunately for me, this one fell a little short.  <br /> <br />Jeanette <br />APOOO BookClub <br />	2005-04-29

He cheated on her and she is entitled to this according to their prenuptial agreement.  Anthony is hell-bent on not paying her this amount, because he did not cheat on her, despite the damaging photographs and the media attention. And more so, because he is not willing to give up on his marriage.  For Anthony, marriage means forever, and if he can get the wife to understand that he was only helping a woman in distress, not hugged up with a prostitute, everything would be all right.  In Kayla Perrin's Gimme Me an O, Anthony Beals will do anything to keep his marriage intact.<br /><br />Dr. Lecia Calhoun, sex therapist aka Dr. Love, has written a best seller book titled the Big O.  In an appearance on a late night talk show, she meets Anthony Beals.  Dr. Love already has preconceived notions regarding Anthony based on an impromptu talk with his wife, Ginger.  Ginger has painted Anthony as a dangerous, out of control husband who she is deathly afraid of.  Anthony sees Dr. Love as the one person his wife trusts and would be willing to talk to.  When his wife comes up missing and fingers are being pointed at him, Anthony practically kidnaps Dr. Love and takes her on cross-country trip to clear is name.  Dr. Love and Anthony enter into a uneasy truce, as Anthony begins to reveal his real feelings and Dr. Love finds out Anthony is not such a bad guy.<br /><br />Ms. Perrin wrote a very good book incorporating humor, mystery and romance.  The reasoning behind the actions of Ginger was easy to figure out, but because Anthony was so naive, this was a fun book to read just to see when the light bulb would go off.  Gimme an O and Dr. Love may be purely fictional, but Chapter 13 that details \\"HOW TO DRIVE YOUR WOMAN CRAZY WITH PASSION!\\" is the truth.<br /><br />Jeanette<br /><br />APOOO BookClub	2005-04-24

In Playing My Mother's Blues, Valerie Wilson Wesley delves into the life of sisters Dani and Rose, and their mother Maria who now calls herself Mariah.<br /><br />Mariah married too young to a man much older than she.  When Durrell Alexander comes along, his sweet-talking and tender lovemaking makes Mariah feel young again.  Things are going well, until Mariah shoots him to death and goes to jail for twenty years.  While reading the paper, she discovers that her ex- husband Hilton Dells has died. His death brings back memories of her daughters that she has not seen in twenty years.  On the surface, it appears that her daughters are doing well.  Dani is married, has a young child and is a successful woman in her own right.  Rose, though not married is a successful educator. What Mariah does not know is what lies beneath the smiles.  Dani, unhappy in her marriage has found happiness elsewhere, and is mimicking her mother's actions.  Rose, happy with the secret rendezvous with her married lover, has discovered a lump in her (...).  The funeral of Hilton Dells brings them face to face for the first time in two decades.  When Dani's problem becomes evident and she flees the memorial service,  Mariah follows her and takes her to her apartment to console her.  Soon after, an angry Rose shows up at the apartment and all three women come to terms with the feelings of anger, abandonment and sorrow.<br /><br />I enjoyed how this story was told over the course of three days, the flashbacks and memories made me feel as if I was following the family from beginning to end.  Flashing back in time, then fast forwarding to the present made each character complete and the story more dynamic.  The transitions from past to present were smooth.  I also enjoyed Wilson-Wesley's lyrical writing style.  This is a book I highly recommend for your reading pleasure.<br /><br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub.     Jeanette  APOOO BookClub	2005-04-24

He has the good looks women love, but he comes with a lot of baggage. Porter splits with his high school sweetheart, Reesey, when he finally recognizes that  the blue -eyed baby with his name is not his child.  He has a turbulent relationship at best with his parents, an unlikely friendship with the flamboyant drag queen Jade and a difficult time choosing appropriate relationships.  Porter is about ready to give it all up and turn everything over to God when he sees a pretty lady. His first sighting of her is at the gym, then at his parent's restaurant and finally while on the job, he saves her son`s life.<br /><br />Winona Fairchild is the single mother of two.  She makes the move from Houston back to her hometown of Detroit.  Winona brings a lot of secrets with her.  Her son's real father lives in Detroit. Winona buys a house across the street from where he lived in hopes of seeing him again.  Winona's intent is to continue  the charade of hiding Carlton's father identity.  She alienates herself from her parents and has a new job that is not what she expected.  Winona's friend Gina is a godsend and the family dog, Sampson helps her keep her sanity.  When Porter and Winona finally come together, sparks fly.  But, there are problems.  Porter is 10 years younger than Winona and Winona has not told him all there is to know.  Can they overcome these obstacles? That  is the question.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book when I read it as Memories of Yesterday and enjoyed it again the second time.  While the children really got on my nerves, this was a good read with quite a few laugh out loud moments.  However, I wish certain characters like Jade, Pam and Damion had more of a closure to their story than just fading away.  Porter and Winona characterizations were good and once I finished the book, then I could understand their actions and reactions.

A mature audience sticker needs to be on each book, for this book is X rated.  G-Spot is violent and delves into sexual and emotional abuse.  For those who live close to the streets, this may be the norm, but for most of the people I know, to live this type of life is unimaginable.<br /><br />Born to a crack addicted mother and raised by a sanctified number running grandmother, Juicy is 19 years old when she becomes Granite McKay's woman.  Granite, better known as G, is the king of the drug world in Harlem. G's position places Juicy and her brother Jimmy in a world of luxury that they have never known before. With all that she is privy too, Juicy is unhappy. She is sexually unsatisfied and has to rely on her own fingers to bring relief.  Much to Juicy's dismay, her younger, mentally unstable brother is in awe of G and wants nothing more than to work for G.  The bright spot for Juicy is when G's son Gino returns to Harlem to work in his father's empire.  Juicy and Gino find themselves dangerously attracted to each other.  The punishment for double crossing G is brutal.<br /><br />G-Spot has been called urban fiction meets erotica, but each reader will have to make their own determination of what they call erotica.  The sex scenes are graphic and sometimes none to pretty.  The punishments endured by Juicy are horrific.  However, if you can get past the explicit violence and sex, the story underneath is well written about a young girl who grows up too fast, expects too much and finds out that living high is not what it is cracked up to be.  While shocked through most of the book, it was a page-turner because I had to find out what was going to happen next.  While I can not recommend G-Spot to everyone, if someone asks I will encourage them to pick it up and read it for themselves.<br /><br />Jeanette<br /><br />APOOO BookClub	2005-02-15

Spiegel's love life was a mess and this reader wondered how a woman who is supposed to have it as together as Spiegel could not move past damaging relationships.

If she did not already know this herself, she could not help but know  as both men and women often stop her to comment on her beauty. She uses her beauty to manipulate those who she thinks can assist her in getting ahead in life.  In this novel, Schooling Carmen by Kathleen Cross, Carmen learns that beauty is only skin deep and she has a long way to become a beautiful person.<br /><br />Carmen is a school guidance counselor at Overland High School.  Her preconceived notions about her Hispanic students guide her as she squashes their future dreams. In fact, her attitude towards the children is the cause of her losing the love of her life, Randall Winston.  Carmen, the master manipulator, uses her nerdy co-worker, Eugene, to get an introduction to George Browning, the superintendent of schools.  Carmen is anxious to meet this man as he holds the key to her getting away from the poverty-stricken Overland school and into the job as the head guidance counselor at the TAG academy.  However, Carmen over estimates her ability to handle Mr. Browning and finds there is a steep price to pay for his assistance.<br /><br />Carmen's vanity is very much an issue.  When her doctor informs her of a serious medical problem that needs immediate attention, Carmen ignores her.  Pedro Camacho is the owner of an auto repair shop.  When he delivers Carmen's car to her job, without warning, she begins to berate him because she felt he was taking advantage of her and because he is Hispanic.  Only after she took a breath and let him talk did she find that she had jumped to conclusions and Pedro had good reasons for not being available for her phone calls.  Carmen and Pedro have a chance meeting at the cemetery and when he overhears Carmen telling her father about her medical condition, Pedro Camacho steps in. He assembles Eugene, the one friend who has always been there for Carmen, waiting patiently for her to return his affection.  Her sister, Lindsay, the only family member she has a civil relationship with and Yvette, the friend Carmen dismissed because of a silly disagreement, to help her through the difficult times.<br /><br />Schooling Carmen is a touching book. When I read the acknowledgements I could not imagine how difficult it was for this author to write such a book after suffering her own personal tragedy.  This story touches on what can happen when one waits to get treatment.  It also forces one to face their own mortality.  Throughout the book, the author illustrates Carmen's growth as a person as she struggles to overcome her ideologies about herself and others.  This is a very good read.

This is a funny but spiritual read about how twenty- something Chantell Meyers evolves from a spoiled materialistic woman to a woman with a new purpose in her life.  The heart of this story rests in Jer. 29:11 \\"For I know the thoughts that I think of toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end.\\"  What happens to Chantell is kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy; she expected bad things to happen so that's how she lived her life, waiting on them to happen.<br /><br />Chantell was just five years old when her mother died, twelve when her grandmother died and a year later her best friend Keith Rashaad moved away.  Chantell remembers being told that bad things happen in threes and by the age of thirteen she had suffered three major loses.  To further complicate things, she was taught not to cry, and not to talk about her mother.  These are the things that shaped Chantell's life.  Because she was so afraid of losing someone else she loved, she had problems in developing relationships.  She had one person she could call a true friend, Tia.  Her relationship with her boyfriend Eric was empty at best, but due to her fears she suffered through this relationship that was going nowhere.<br /><br />Chantell found herself in church making changes in her life after her father suffered a near fatal heart attack.  Chantel began to make some changes in her life. The most unpopular change was when she decided to cut off the sexual encounters with Eric.  She began to take a deep look inside her life and found she needed to bring closure to those things troubling her, mainly regarding her mother.  Also, during this time, Keith Rashaad returns to her life.  He sees potential in Chantel that she can not see in herself. Unfortunately, until she is able to come to terms with her past she is unable to move forward.<br /><br />Denise Michelle Harris writes this book so that women of all ages can relate.  I admit I was a little hesitant to pick up yet another book featuring a twenty-something year old woman  looking for Mr. Right.  What I found in this book was a young woman with deep-rooted problems striving to make significant changes in her life.  Though she stumbles and makes mistakes, she preseveres.  I think there is a lesson for all ages in this book.

Virginia City's finest detective, Jason Jerrard,  is probably every Chief of Police's nightmare. He is good at his job, but is insubordinate and utilizes unorthodox methods as a means to solving his cases.  Resolving the city's toughest cases had not been a problem for him, until he is stumped by a serial rapist/murderer ravishing the city.  In the midst of his investigation of this case Jason is temporarily suspended from the force.  During his suspension he happens to meet Sasha at his favorite restaurant while eating his favorite food, runny scrambled eggs.  Immediately, they hit if off and begin a whirlwind hot and steamy romance.  While Jason is romancing Sasha, his ex-wife is plotting to win him back.  She is determined to have Jason at all costs.<br /><br />Love & Justice has  steamy sex scenes, suspense and a wild unexpected conclusion.  I am unsure whether Johnson intended this novel to be a romance with a mystery or a mystery with romance.  So much of the novel is devoted to the romance, that I wondered if the author had forgotten about the rapist/murderer running rampant through the city. Just as this reader was beginning to lose interest, the suspense and action began.  The  dialogue between characters was stiff and the flashbacks were not clearly defined and many times it took a while to figure out the characters were reminiscing about the past.  If you enjoy romantic thrillers this may be the book for you.<br /><br />Jeanette<br /><br />APOOO Bookclub	2004-09-11

In my opinion Solomon Jones is one of the best in this genre.  In his novels, it's not all about the street actions, there is a purpose behind the madness.  In Ride or Die, the young and pretty preacher's kid, Keisha, should be enjoying life, yet she is running for her life.<br /><br />Keisha Anderson is the daughter of the Reverend Anderson, a prominent pastor in the city of Philadelphia.  Jamal Nichols is the son of Frank Nichols, the drug lord of the neighborhood.  Jamal and Keisha are in love; however, their fathers Reverend Anderson and Frank Nichols have a history that should make their children stay far away from each other.  After Keisha is attacked on her way to church, Rev. Anderson confronts Frank and is determined to bring him down.  During an early morning demonstration called by the Reverend. in front of one of Frank`s establishments, the Police Commissioner is shot and killed.  The confusion afterwards gives Jamal and Keisha a chance to run away and be together.  On the run, they become aware that someone fitting Jamal's description is wanted for killing the commissioner.<br /><br />This is an exciting fast paced novel in which most of the events happens within a 24-hour span.  If you read Jones' previous novel, The Bridge, you will remember Detective Lynch; he is back as the lead detective trying to solve this difficult case.  Even though this is classified as urban fiction, a novel about the streets, Jones does a very good job exploring why Keisha is so willing to turn from good girl to bad girl, why Frank and the Reverend hate each other and how the Reverend and his wife are living two lives, one for church and another for home.  The profile of the Anderson family is superb;  the graphic details are vivid;  the ending profound. This is a very good read.<br /><br />Jeanette<br /><br />APOOO BookClubbr />	2004-09-11

Instead, they expect for you to take care of their apartments, water their plants and walk the dog.  If you are Margaret Drew, you take on the responsibility and do a little snooping.  What Margaret finds transforms her from plain Jane to the ultimate diva in Donna Hill's newest novel, Divas, Inc.<br /><br />From the time they were toddlers, Tiffany Lane and Chantel Hollis were on their way to becoming divas.  Margaret Drew was lucky to be their friend, however she benefited very little from this alliance.  Tiffany and Chantel wore designer clothes, Margaret shopped at K-marts.  They lived in expensive condos in Manhattan and Margaret lived in a one-bedroom walkup apartment in Harlem.  They rode around in Tiffany's Jaguar and Margaret caught the bus.  So when Tiffany and Chantel decide to go to Europe and leave Margaret home to water the plants and walk the dog, she decides it's time for her to get a taste of the good life.  Since they did not invite her to go along, Margaret felt justified in rambling through Tiffany and Chantel's closets.  She began dressing in their designer clothes and shoes,  wearing their  make up and wigs, a new Margaret emerges and she is a diva.  The question is can she handle all that comes with the title of diva?<br /><br />Donna Hill displays her versatility as a writer as she tackles the \\"Chick Lit\\" genre. Having read other novels dubbed as \\"Chick Lit\\" written by British authors, I feel Divas, Inc. equals if not surpasses the other novels I read in this genre.  Filled with quirky secondary characters such as Margaret's grandma, Willie and the dog, Virginia, this novel is a funny and enjoyable read.  Are you a Diva?

But, as Monique learns as she chronicles her walk with God that if you trust Him, you will reap all kind of benefits.   <br /> <br />Monique's prayer in the beginning of the book was that she would meet a 'Christian\\" man and she did in the form of Mark, a deacon in the church.  Monique and Mark begin a relationship, but early on it is apparent this is not a relationship condoned by God.   Monique suffers spiritually and personally as a result of this relationship.  Monique's friend, Linda, invites Monique and her children to her church.  At this church, Monique begins to grow spiritually and as she does, her faith increases and therefore her blessings increase.   <br /> <br />When I read this book five years ago it was a blessing because I was at the same point in my life as the author.  Trying to find that Mr. Right by myself and making all the wrong choices.  Now, picking up this book again, five years later, it was a blessing to me because I am at the point the author is, learning to let go and let God be my guide in a new church with a renewed determination.

Dr. Vincent is starting his own dental practice and Nina is working alongside him.  Life is good for this couple.<br /><br />Dr. Charlene Hayward is extremely beautiful and smart, but she has a dark side.  If she feels she has been scorned by a man, then she can become his worse nightmare.  Mayor Raymond Dalton, her married romantic interest, becomes a victim when he suffers a dental emergency on New Years' Eve and Dr. Hayward  is the only dentist available to help him.  Dr. Hayward is immediately sorry for her rash act and her actions cost her both professionally and financially.  In order to get back on her feet she has to seek the help of Dr. Vincent.  Her entrance into his life causes much turmoil.<br /><br />This novel had the potential to be an exciting page turning read, however, the author did not allow the characters to tell the story.  The author provided a lot of narrative to tell the feelings and actions of the characters.  There was little left to the imagination and the story was predictable.  Sewell does do a good job in using flashbacks of the characters lives. This help the reader to understand the characters actions and thoughts.  The transitions between the past and current happenings were smooth and well defined.  The ending was quite a stretch, but leaves room for a third installment in the Dr. Vincent saga.

Each character reminisces about their families, their early childhood friendship, and adventures in alternating chapters, detailing how they came to be a couple.<br /><br />Nina was older than Aaron by just a few minutes, but in their relationship she often lorded over him  as if she were ages ahead of him.  Aaron was always the sensitive one, willing to talk things out as opposed to Nina's quick tempered, ready to fight demeanor.  Aaron comes from a \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" lifestyle while Nina's father is hiding out as a wanted man, believing that his bad luck is due to the white man.  Nina is a professional while Aaron is a struggling photographer and bartends to bring in extra income.  She's a neat freak, he is a slob.  She has issues with trust and he wonders why she does not trust him.  With all the opposites its a wonder they can connect on a romantic level or maybe they are together just because they have always been together.  This couple struggles to find a happy medium.<br /><br />The background about the family and the couples informative years was very interesting and provided enough background for strong character development.  The look inside the strip clubs was enlightening  The sex scenes were steamy and tastefully written.  What made the reading difficult and slow was the amount of narrative.

Mychel Hernandez, the lone female firefighter on the \\"C\\" shift, set her sights on Jerome, despite his rebuffs.  Chief Lloyd Frederickson was blindsided when his wife stated she wanted a divorce.

It starts with one simple letter to the station from Rice and for months they correspond by mail.  In their letters to each other they fall in love, sight unseen.  Will the love still exist when they finally come face to face?<br />In The Switch by Lisa Watson, Justin Langley attempts to save Sabrina Ridgemont the embarrassment of being stood up by his best friend, Adrian.  Justin means to tell her the truth of who he really is, but an ex-fiance shows up with some unkind things to say and Justin cannot reveal his true identity. When the truth is revealed, how will Sabrina react?<br />Love is Blind is a book for the true romantic.  In each story falling in love with an unknown person is the central theme.  While Love is Just a Click Away was an easy and humorous read, the other two stories were long and drawn out.

At age seven, she was preaching to her friends, dolls and stuffed animals.  Her father,  Reverend Theodore Carter believes that women have no place in the pulpit.  For every scripture Reverend Carter quotes why Journee should not be a pastor, she is able to counter with a scripture that says she can.  When Journee defies him and becomes the pastor of New Faith Baptist Church, the relationship between she and her father suffers.<br />Being the Pastor is difficult for Journee.  Not only does she have to deal with church members who do not want a female pastor, but also her own demons.  She is single and lonely.  Kingston Lavery is a good-looking member who catches Journee's eye, and she wonders if he is the one God is sending her.  Kingston knows of her interest in him and uses this information to try to make advances towards her, even though he is engaged to another.  Other members also can see Journee's  interest in Kingston, and this attraction, no matter how innocent could be the cause of her downfall when the disgruntled Assistant Pastor sets a trap for her.<br />Jacquelin Thomas composes a wonderful story, just in time for Father's Day, about a daughter's love for her father.  Even though they have their ups and downs, their bond is strong and true.  This story explores the old tradition of the Southern Baptist Churches that women should not be pastors It also sheds light on the difficulties of a pastor's life.  There is more to being a pastor than just getting up on Sunday morning and preaching.  Journee is a real woman with the same issues and dreams of other women.  This is a very good book that I highly recommend.<br />Jeanette<br />Motown Review Book Club<br />APOOO BookClub	2004-05-28

When you read this novel, you will realize that the characters in this book are not so nice.  You will be on the edge of your seat as you travel from Malibu, California to Alexandria, Virginia following the vicious crime spree committed by the recently released twins.  <br />In July 2001, the twins are set free from prison, While in prison, they plotted and planned revenge on those who mistreated them on the inside and outside.  First, they had to take care of the prison warden, then Heather Connelly, a high school sweetheart.  More vicious killings soon followed.  FBI agent Phoenix Perry was vacationing in California when she read about the murder of the prison warden.  Her curiosity piqued, she could hardly finish her vacation before her detective mind began churning with ways to solve this case. Very few clues, a hard-nosed boss, and an over sexed partner, are just a few obstacles Phoenix faced in her quest to get the killers off the streets.  A trip to the post office and a phone call from the West Coast provide clues that lead Phoenix to the culprits.  <br />Keith Lee Johnson provides an exciting tale that was full of surprise twists and turns.  The action was fast paced and edgy. Maybe a true mystery reader would be able to read between the lines and figure out many of the questions this reader had at the end.  It appears the author is planning on writing a series of Phoenix Perry mysteries and I will look forward to each one.  I liked the concept he used of short chapters, it provided a build up to the action.  I would recommend this book to those who enjoy books with fast paced action, but I would be remiss if I did not post a warning regarding some graphic scenes. <br />Jeanette<BR>APOOO BookClub	2004-04-27

In Sibyl Avery Jackson's suspense novel, Degree of Caution, the world of telecommunications takes a front seat.  When Bayou City Wireless invents and tests their newest cell phone, the Excalibur, problems are plentiful.  Many people who use or have access to information about the Excalibur die or disappear.  The FCC and FBI are investigating Bayou City Wireless and its owners, the Conti Brothers.<br />Monica Jackson is a retired FBI agent and a current author of mystery novels.  She is approached by her brother, the assistant director of the FBI, to help with this difficult case.  Monica refuses until a friend, who discovered some vital information, is killed.  Monica is transformed into Taylor LeBlanc and goes undercover as a public relations specialist in Bayou City Wireless company.  In this job she uncovers many of the misdeeds of Gerald Conti, who is determined to get the Excalibur to the market at all costs.  She elicits the help of Cameron Maxwell, an engineer in the company and finds herself falling in love with him.  Together Monica and Cameron try to find the answers to why the people who used the Excalibur during the testing period all die from cancer.  The answer lies with the last living survivor, Dave Carter who is presumed dead.<br />This novel has a lot of action and suspense that crisscrossed the nation between Texas and Washington DC.  However, the  use of technical terms and descriptions of the telecommunication industry at times slowed the reading down. There were very  interesting secondary characters such as Jazz, ,Big Red and Sweets.  I also liked how Jackson made the protagonist Monica a multi-dimensional character.  Not only was she solving a case for the FBI, but had to deal with issues regarding her father, relationships and commitment.  While this reader was able to figure out some obvious twists to the storyline, I would still recommend  this novel as a good pick for those who get pleasure from reading  suspense novels.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClubthose who get pleasure from reading  suspense novels.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2004-04-04

Laelia is a type of orchid difficult to grow, but a prize when it blooms.  Laelia is a novel that depicts the determination of the Cates sisters to take backs their lives and fulfill their dreams.<br />The highly admired and respected Cates women; Rebecca, Claudia and Gracelyn, are the daughters of the late Reuben and Mattie Cates.  They live in the family mansion in Peoria, Illinois along with their husbands, who have made the sisters lives miserable throughout their marriages.  Now, each of the husbands suffers from some debilitating illness:  Bernard,  terminal bone cancer; Timothy alcoholism and Jake a closed-head injury.  After caring for the men for many years, the oldest sister Rebecca decides its time to put the men away so they can begin to enjoy life again. To garner support from the community and the church, the sisters must scheme and plan the men departures carefully. To make their mission more acceptable they begin by making announcements at church that the men will be committed to various institutions.  Speaking up in church and becoming more visible, the women gain the support of the women in the church, but the pastor detest their actions.  In the midst of getting rid of the husbands, Rebecca also scheme to get rid of the pastor.  While the sisters are freeing themselves from their men happiness lurks around the corner for each of them.<br />I found this book to be a page-turner as I eagerly awaited to see how the women would get rid of the men and the pastor, and to see if anyone would challenge their actions.  The pacing and timing of events in this novel was excellent.  I found this to be a refreshing change of pace from the usual relationship books.  Highly recommended.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2004-03-24

She does not disappoint in providing fun characters in Sarita Grayson and Mykal Chandler.  The story tackles the effects of poverty and drugs in the inner city and one very determined young lady to make a difference in her neighborhood.<br />Poor as a church mouse, Sarita Grayson is the director of the community center located on the lower eastside of Detroit.  When it looks as if she will lose the center, she takes on a dangerous assignment given to her by a small time drug dealer.  Extremely handsome and rich, Mykal Chandler is the handsome brother of the Mayor of Detroit.  He is an architect by trade, but his nighttime activities are more dangerous.  While out on their  respective secret missions  Sarita and Mykal have their first explosive encounter.  Their second meeting, arranged by Sarita's friend and Mykal's half brother  Saint, is a life changing encounter.  After accepting his proposition, Mykal gives Sarita the opportunity to see herself as a beautiful woman and awakens a passion in her that she did not know she possessed.<br />The characters in Ms Jenkins' novel are fun.  Their actions are genuine and the conversations very real.  Ms Jenkins has a way of incorporating  conflict resolution  and  problem solving into the story without making  the female character appear weak and cowardly.  If you have never read a romance by Beverly Jenkins, then this is a good one to start.  However, I would recommend getting your hands on every historical romance novel she has written; you will not be disappointed.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub<br />Motown Review BookClub	2004-03-20

If you belong to a book club you know it can become a very intricate part of your life.  Some clubs are social events, some are very structured, some are gender specific and some are just informal gatherings.  However, the members all have one thing in common and that's their love for books.<br />In the Atlanta based book club B.E.L.L.E.S, the members thrived on being pretentious, and each meeting was more extravagant than the next.  When men are allowed to join the club a not so secret romance is formed between two of the members.  In the Bay Area Online Readers, a few of the members meet at a book signing at Marcus Bookstore.  While easy to recognize based on their physical descriptions, the perceptions are some times way off base.  In the all male book club Ballers, Shotcallers and Book Worms, athletic and savvy businessmen are invited to have their meeting at the home of a woman they met at the gym.  She delves into the psyche of the men as she pursues her dream of writing a book about book clubs.  The New York based Everybody's Book Club members worked at the World Trade Center and are very effected by September 11th.  The Washington DC, based Women of the Knight is a club were the women all claim to be friends and come together in crises, but trust is a major issue.<br />I anticipated reading this book for quite a while.  I had a different idea of what to expect.  I was more looking forward to reading about the accounts of what went on at book club meetings and their actual discussion of books.  However, what I got was stories narrated by one member of the club and how the relationship of the members developed over time.  I was also very disappointed in the editing of this book.  There were obvious spelling and grammatical errors that should have been picked up by a good editor.  I think book club members for all types of book clubs will enjoy taking a peek at what other book clubs are experiencing.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClubfor all types of book clubs will enjoy taking a peek at what other book clubs are experiencing. <br />Jeanette<BR>APOOO BookClub	2004-03-03

Relative Interest will make any reader stop and examine how they feel about issues presented in this novel.<br />Kira Forester is an up and coming journalist.  She has spent fifteen years at BPR, a business weekly newspaper published in the Charlotte area of North Carolina.  Her dream is to get on as a journalist with the parent company in New York.  On her way to realizing this dream, she completes an assignment in Africa, regarding abuse and underpayment for child labor. Upon her return to the United States, she is informed that Vicky, her young niece and only relative is going to be adopted.  Kira is not interested in raising Vicky, but now wants to get to know the child she has neglected for the past five years.  When she meets the adoptive family immediately red flags go up, and she begins to wonder if they are the right family for Vicky.  When Kira meets Evan Conley, the owner and director of the adoption agency another type of flag goes up.  Kira's investigative instincts takes  her to the small town of Monroeville, which is in the midst of a heated mayoral race between Mr. Roper and Frank Thompson.  A race that she unwittingly becomes  tangled up in and could jeopardize all that she has strived  toward.<br />Ms. Bunkley has written a novel that had so many points that could provide lively discussion.  The dilemmas Kira faced had me in deep thought through much of this novel, wondering how I would react in the same situation.  The story was set in North Carolina, a picturesque city and the author did a good job in making the scenery come to life.  While not a fast paced or intense storyline, this novel is one that I would recommend to my bookclub because I know it will bring about a lively discussion, especially since half of my bookclub members can relate to the foster care/transracial adoption story.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClubcan relate to the foster care/transracial adoption story.  <br />Jeanette<BR>APOOO BookClub	2004-01-27

Allen pens several short stories, quite a few revolving around the life of Elwyn in the book, Churchboys and Other Sinners.  The characters in the stories are young men and women trying to live a straight  life .  The reader first meets the young Elwyn in the story Thirty Fingers. This story chronicles his life from when he gets a piano by way of his benefactor, Deacon Morrisohn, his desire to become the minister of Music at the Church of Our Blessed Redeemer Who Walked Upon the Water, his crush on Peachie and his relationship with Mrs. Morrisohn.  In My Father's Business, Elwyn is now sixteen and still infatuated with Peachie, even though she is going to marry another.  Elwyn is also doing his Father's work by witnessing at school and making waves with the principal regarding his behavior.  In Apostate, Elwyn is getting ready to leave for college.  His grandmother discovers his relationship with Mrs. Morrisohn.  In Lord of Travel, Elwyn is an adult. A used car salesman, he has turned his back on his faith.  Life is not good but he still shows he has a good heart.<br />Besides the stories revolving around Elwyn, there are six other stories.  While the stories were not bad, they had no deep meaning or revelation.  I could not ascertain what the author wanted the reader to get from them besides entertainment. I probably would have enjoyed the book more if it had been all about Elwyn and his struggles to live a \\"saved\\" life and how he fell by the wayside.

Five years later, he is newly married and claims to be a changed man.  He is now the pastor of the larger, more lucrative Truth Baptist Church.  Also back is his daughter, Alicia, now a teenager and Curtis is learning about the saying, your kids will give you back double what you put others through. Curtis is certainly reaping what he has sowed.  Alicia is quite a handful.<br />Curtis Black hears the call of God telling him to return to the ministry.  Everything seems to be going well until he makes a phone call to an old friend and begins to take giant steps backwards.  He cannot help himself, after all, his wife can not satisfy his sexual needs and Satan is jealous that he has returned to the pulpit and is after his soul.  Curtis not only begins neglecting his longsuffering wife, Mariah, but also his teenage daughter Alicia.  Alicia tries a variety of antics to garner her father's attention including  skipping classes, failing in school and being rude to Mariah.  She finds little results with these techniques so she takes it a step further and becomes involved with Julian, a young man she met in a singles chat room.  She finds herself in a situation she cannot handle.  Juggling his women, wife, daughter and trying to convince the deacons of the church to go along with his greedy desires, Curtis finds himself in a position to lose everything, again.<br />With characters you will love to hate, Too Much of a Good Thing is the perfect sequel to Casting the First Stone.  Roby does an excellent job of using dialogue and narrative so that the readers feel like they are eavesdropping on the conversations between the characters.  I especially like that the ending is not wrapped up in a nice little neat bow, but tragedy and self discovery leaves room for another story featuring Curtis Black.	2004-01-08

Rayne Holland is an award winning filmmaker with a past that haunts her continuously. After her husband and daughter's sudden death and a subsequent suicide attempt, Rayne is admitted to Cedar Grove Hospital.  While in the hospital she meets Dr. Pauline Dennis, the psychologist, who is determined to help Rayne at any cost. Dr. Dennis feels a kinship with Rayne as Rayne's experiences parallels her own experiences.  In her desire to help Rayne and to prevent Rayne from having to undergo electric shock treatment, Dr. Dennis helps Rayne escape the hospital by coercing Rayne's best friend, Gayle, to hide her.  Because of their long-lasting and close friendship, Gayle risks her already shaky marriage to help save her friend.  While things appear to be gloomy for Rayne, her bright spot is the hospital's landscaper, Robert, who quietly and unassumingly aids Rayne in her recovery, as he deals with his own traumatic past.<br />The research that Ms. Hill did for this novel is exceptional, evident by the scenes between patient and therapist and the unspoken thoughts of Rayne.  This is not an easy book to read but you can find yourself mesmerized by the happenings as you root for Rayne's recovery.  There will be characters you will detest and others  you will cheer on as they overcome dark secrets and reclaim their lives.

When he goes to the altar to give his life to Christ, a miracle is performed and he is healed of his stuttering.   Filled with the spirit, Cordell witnesses to everyone about his experience.  Soon Westside becomes saved also.  As young people and babes in Christ, Cordell and Westside have a lot to learn about the politics of the church and the antics of the \\"saints\\".  They also have problems just being young black men facing unemployment, family issues and relationships.  The two brothers in Christ had different but very common reactions to their lives as Christians.  <br />Barrett deals with quite a few issues and problems that young Christians face everyday.  This reader would have liked to have seen the author just deal with a few of the issues and fully develop them instead of glossing over them and then several chapters later surprising the reader with a conclusion.  There were a few problems with transitions where the author dove into the past or changed subjects without warning.  With good editing and a more developed storyline, this could have been a real good book.  I commend the author for writing this book on young Christians and I look forward to more work by Ms. Barrett as her writing matures.  <br />Jeanette<BR>APOOO BookClub	2004-01-04

Edward quickly learns what it takes to make his wife happy, even when  the best advice comes from his eccentric uncle Eddie and aunt Etta and sets his sight on getting back home by Christmas with a new attitude.<br />This was a quick fun quick read for the holidays.

She loves children and is often in the presence of various nieces and nephews.  She was babysitting her brother's children when one took sick and she had to call on Doctor Matthew Peterson to make a house call in Deirdre Savoy's latest romance novel, Not the One. A look, a touch and the electricity that this couple causes could be hazardous.<br />Nina would like children, but does not want to fall in love and get married.  All she can envision is being left alone by a man and grow old and  bitter like her mother and aunts. When her grandmother suffers a minor stroke, Nina decides that maybe the idea of getting married and having children is not so bad. In her mind, she would be making her grandmother happy by settling down and raising a family.  She suggests to Dr. Peterson that they get married for six months.  The marriage could kill two birds with one stone; he would get the five million dollars he inherited from his aunt and she would have someone to father her children.  The plan seems easy, except for a rash decision Dr. Peterson made years prior and the fact that they refuse to admit they are in love with each other.<br />This couple's lack of communication is frustrating at times, but Ms. Savoy does a good job of mixing in humor and steamy sex scenes to compensate for the character's shortcomings.  There were great secondary characters in cousin Yasmin, sister Frankie and  Dr. Peterson's parents.

I also found much of the book to be unrealistic and the ending too neat.  I would just say as a person who has a Master's degree in Counseling, there is no way a good counselor would continue to see a person  she was not qualified to help or they would seek guidance from someone experienced in dealing with that particular psychosis. . I also found it hard to believe that Clara never heard about God as her savior, or the concept of Christian counseling.  I had no real motivation to continue to read this book other than to just finish it because I started it.   <br />Jeanette <BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-11-22

She wants Dwayne to join her Jubilee Network as a television personality. The offer she presents to  Dwayne has many amenities that his wife would have loved, had she lived.  It becomes obvious that Beverlyn is falling for Dwayne, much to the dismay of her uncle and manager, L.W.  L. W. fears he will be out in the cold if Dwayne and Beverlyn get involved in a relationship, so he makes plans to ruin Dwayne and anyone who gets in the way will be hurt.<br /><br />The first two-thirds of the book is devoted to setting up the stage for the eventual drama.  The pacing at times is slow as the characters are introduced and the scenes are being set up for the climax. However, Elmore does a fine job of providing useful information on overcoming obstacles by using counseling techniques and scriptures in the storyline, without being overbearing.  He succeeds in making his famous clients problems common enough in which anyone could relate.  Elmore also does an excellent job of showing how easy it is to get caught up in a glamorous lifestyle.  The scripture that says it is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven has never rang more true than in the case of Dr. Grandison, Beverlyn Boudreaux and L.W.  Mercy, Mercy Me was an enjoyable book.

In Passion's Destiny by Crystal Wilson-Harris, the budding romance between Zane Reeves and Jakarta Dailey is tested when Zane runs for the office of Governor of the state of Louisiana and Jackarta's past is brought to light.<br />Zane Reeves was the Prosecuting Attorney for the parish of New Orleans.  He was happily living his life and dating Jakarta Dailey when he was approached to run for Governor of the state.  For Zane, this was the opportunity to begin his dream of running for political office.  Jakarta Dailey was happy to be by Zane's side and serve as his \\"political conscious\\" during the campaign.  Everything was fine on the campaign trail until a disgruntled campaign worker, searched and found some negative information about Jakarta.  Realizing this information could hurt Zane's chance at winning the election, Jakarta flees home to Detroit.  However, Zane was not going to let the rumors and misinformation cause him to lose Jakarta.  He follows her to Detroit and brings her back to Louisiana and his campaign tour, much to his supporter's dismay.  Zane's focus is on winning the race based on the issues and not Jakarta's past.<br />It is ironic that I picked up this book in the midst of the California Governor's race.  Similarly, the issues are not the focus, but any negative press in the candidates or their entourage lives become the focal point of the election.  The author does a good job of portraying the behind the scene action of a political campaign and mixing in a little romance.  Alone, Zane's character was pretty much one dimensional, Jakarta was much more interesting thus adding much more energy to the story.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-10-09

A devastating phone call informs her that her husband has been in a terrible automobile accident.  She rushes to the hospital and what she learns there, turns her world upside down.  Not only is her husband, Donald dead, but she also learns of his unfaithfulness. Sharon, his mistress, also perished in the accident.  This storyline is the center of Patricia Anne Phillips' second novel, June in Winter.<br />Tracey finds it difficult to deal with the death of her husband, and it is even harder for her to accept that he was cheating on her.  She buries herself in her work and in helping family and friends, neglecting any kind of social life.  She rejects the idea of falling in love again, until she runs into Dr. Travis Howard a second time. He is smitten with Tracey, but she is reluctant to become involved with Dr. Howard since his sister was her deceased husband's mistress.  Tracey has to come to the realization that she can not let Donald and Sharon's actions dictate who she can have a relationship with, therefore predicting her happiness.  Dr. Howard is very persistent in helping Tracey to deal with her grief and to find love again.<br />While this is a typical and predictable romance, excellent secondary characters and sub-plots add some spice to the tale.  Tracey's sister, Robin and the fatal attraction story, adds suspense. Aunt Flora adds wisdom and finds a companion of her own.  Wendy, Michelle and Stella bring their own kind of uniqueness to the story.  I think romance readers will find this book a worthwhile read.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-10-02

Justine Dasant vows that she will never let him go and if she can't have him no one will.  Suspense and intrigue dominate this debut novel, The Kiss of Judas, by Renee Allen.  <br />Justine Dasant appears to be a together woman on the surface.  She is a beautiful and successful advertising executive.  She dated Isaiah for over a year and claimed to love him as much as he loved her.  Justine was also involved with Tony, who was in love with her.  She does not return his love, but is unable to distance herself from him. After Isaiah catches them together, he ends his relationship with Justine. The break-up frees Isaiah to move on with his life.  He accepts his calling to preach and begins a relationship with Debra, a beautiful model.  They begin an intense fast paced relationship, much to Justine's chagrin. Justine cannot stand seeing Isaiah going on without her and feels he has wronged her.  Justine seeks to avenge this perceived wrong in the same manner she has avenged other perceived wrongs. Justine uses her friends and Tony as  accomplices in her dangerous plots.  When Justine is angry and on the loose, strange things happen and people disappear.  <br />There are times where the storyline lags, but then becomes exciting.  Several different plots were introduced, some of which fizzled due to lack of development.   There were a few grammatical mistakes that could have easily been corrected with good editing. However, Ms. Allen pens a story that is suspenseful and full of surprising twists and turns.  The shocking ending is worth the reading experience.<br />Jeanette <BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-09-29

Twenty-two years ago Nicholas Reynolds and Asia Morrell were in college and in love.  Suddenly Asia disappeared, dropped out of school and moved away.  Skip to the present. Nicholas receives a visit from Isaiah Morell, an angry young man, who claims to be his son.  One look at Isaiah and Nicholas realizes he is telling the truth.<br />Isaiah or Ike the Psyche, as the NBA basketball star known to NBA fans, was never told the identity of his father.  His mother, Asia Morell, felt it was best not to tell Isaiah's  father, Nicholas, the news when she first found out she was pregnant twenty-two years ago.  She wanted to allow him to finish school and she just knew he would do the right thing and marry her if he knew the truth.  She felt that in the long run, he would resent her seeing her pregnancy as the reason he would not reach his dream of being a lawyer.  Just as father and son are reunited, a tragedy occurs.  The tragedy brings Nicholas and Asia together; although Nicholas harbors underlining anger at Asia for keeping him away from his son.  Nicholas also has an estranged wife, who puts a halt on their divorce plans when she finds out about Asia and Isaiah.  Torrie Jefferson is Isaiah`s girlfriend.  She has a difficult decision to make about her future.  It is up to Nicholas and Asia to ensure that she does not make a mistake that could destroy her relationship with Isaiah.<br />In this novel, the strong Christian is Nicholas Reynolds.  Rarely in Christian fiction is the male character shown in such light.  It was a delight to see Nicholas lead the family in prayer and provide spiritual guidance.  However, the constant apologizing and the rehashing of the past became tiresome.  The family faced so many tragedies that the reading became depressing.  All I could think about was the song, \\"Jesus Knows Just How Much We Can Bear.\\"  Overall, this was a good read.  Not only was there a spiritual story, but there was mystery and suspense surrounding  one of the tragedies.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClubthis was a good read.

Is it when you are released from a 4x7 cell that you have called home for 10 years?  Is it when your mind is able to release the locked-up mentality? Is it when you are able to be on your own and not have to report to a parole officer?  These are the questions that Tower (Theodore) Evans is in search of in Cheryl Robinson's latest novel, When I Get Free.<br />Tower is released from a prison in Oklahoma after serving ten years of a forty-year sentence for drug trafficking.  Charges that may not have come about if he were also not the victim of racial profiling.  While incarcerated Tower had a lot of time to sort out his life.  Instead of focusing on seeking revenge against the other guys who were in the car, he completed the requirements for an associate degree, buffed himself up in the gym and survived.  He returned home a changed man.  A man whose paranoia is more pronounced and the mean and nice voices he hears are constantly in conflict.  He no longer is the \\"big man\\", as he has to start from nothing.  He has the support of his family who remained behind him during his years in prison.<br />It is the women in Tower's life who are causing him the most problems.  Mary, his probation officer, is the key to his freedom and until she decides to release him, he is not free.  Gail is an aspiring writer he meets one rainy night.  They become close friends as she tries to write a book about his experiences as a prisoner.  Tonya is the woman he meets at church who will do anything for him, but he has nothing to give her in return.  Lisa, his woman before he goes to prison and the mother of his child whereabouts are unknown.<br />This fictional account of a real ex- convict's life is raw, gritty and intriguing.  There are no holds barred as Tower graphically tells what goes on in prison.  It is the best example of the survival of the fittest theory.  Life away from prison is not easy and the trials of an ex-convict continue longer after they walk away from the prison.  The author does an excellent job of taking the reader inside the prison and the mind of Tower.  She also provides humor, shows strong family, and makes the reader feel some compassion toward Tower when it appears he is getting a raw deal.  I would highly recommend this novel.  If you have never been to prison reading this book will dissuade you from making the mistakes that can take you to one.

Vernon, NY in her memoirs When Gucci Came First.  Kalico's life is full of sex, drugs and physical abuse.  What can make a young girl turn to this lifestyle? The answer could be a number of things but for Kalico, childhood sexual abuse is a primary factor.<br />Kalico is the typical street diva. She lives high, buying designer clothes and accessories, knows all the right people, especially those with the \\"funds\\".  She has hangout buddies, but no real friends.  The men flock around her, buy her things and supplement her income, for a little piece, but no lover.  She drinks excessively, smokes crack, but do not call her a \\"crackhead\\", and abortion is her form of birth control.  Kalico is BAD.  When Kalico starts seeing a therapist, she decides she is able to make positive changes in her life and work on some personal goals, but it is not as easy as she thinks.<br /><br />Those who enjoy life on the streets, should take a peek at this memoir by Kalico; it could present a rude awakening.  The life is hard, the good times are few and far in-between and the results are devastating.<br />If you enjoyed \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\" you will find Kalico on par with Winter Santiago, though Kalico lets her conscious rule sometimes.

Their parents always said Rose was special therefore her bad deeds went unpunished throughout her childhood and into adulthood.  In Shelia M Goss' novel, ROSES are Thorns, VIOLETS are True, the twins, aptly named after their parent's favorite flowers, are at odds with one another. Can past hurts be buried and new beginnings planted?<br />For Rose, life is a stage and the world is her audience.  She is an actress, singer and has her choice of men.  So why is it that whatever her sister has, she wants.  She seduces Violet's husband, David, and then they marry.  Only, David is still in love with Violet but refuses to divorce Rose.  They stay in a loveless marriage until Rose's extreme actions tear them apart.  Because they are twins, Violet always finds a way to forgive Rose, even when she is the victim of Rose's detrimental actions.  When some photos are mailed to Violet and shows Rose in some compromising positions with Violet's man, the strong bond between the sisters is shattered.  Violet moves away and breaks all ties with Rose.  For ten years the sisters do not communicate.  The tables are turned as Rose now wants a closer relationship with Violet, and Violet who can not trust Rose is unbending in her determination to stay far away from Rose.  It takes the determination of their mother to bring them together.<br />While much of the story is devoted to the relationship between Rose and Violet and the relationship of the ladies and their male friends, the theme of the book is forgiveness.  Not only do the ladies have to find it in their heart to forgive each other, but also forgive those who have hurt them in the past.  I liked how the novel was told in alternating voices as Rose and Violet  explain their actions. I eagerly turned the pages to find out what Rose had up her sleeve, who was to be the \\"man du jour\\" and how far the sisters would go to protect their hearts.

The phone call changed her life and now she tries to do right and set a righteous example for the church members.  However, chaos and confusion reign in this church.  From the pulpit to the balcony, the members fight and raise hell for the sake of being in control and being seen.  When Sister Connie Fuse makes a mistake with Mother Pray Onn's layaway payment, she trembles in her shoes at the fear of retaliation.  Sister Betty and Mother Pray Onn wear the same one-of-a- kind hat to Friends and Family day, and all hell breaks loose.  What happens when Ima Hellraiser attends the fund-raiser meeting? You will have to read this vignette to believe it.<br />I was laughing out loud as I imagined what some of the scenes would be like if acted out on stage.  While reading though, I would have liked for the characters to tell the story with dialogue instead of being told the story by the author.  The set up was there, the descriptions vivid, but for a comedic read there was too much narration.  However, if you ever get a chance to see this play live, I say go!

By modernizing the stories and bringing them into the 21st century, they prove that God's word is long lasting and things just have not changed that much.  The same lessons learned in biblical days are the same lessons learned today.<br />If you remember, Sarah and Abraham were in their 90's when God promised that they would be blessed with a son.  Sarah laughed at God and gave her handmaiden Hagar to Abraham to bear his son.  Later, God fulfilled his promise to the couple and Sarah begat Isaac.  In Baby Blues by Patricia Haley, Sarah Abraham is 50 years old and childless.  Her desire is that her husband have an heir to his business enterprises, so she beseeches her best friend, Gayle, to have a child with her husband.  Her husband, instead of believing and waiting on the promises of God, goes along with his wife's plan.  Being out of the will of God's perfect plan can be problematic.<br />The greatest commandment is to love the Lord with all your heart.  The second is to love your neighbor as yourself, your neighbor being anyone you encounter.  You remember the bible story about the man on the road to Jericho. He fell among thieves and was injured.  People passed by without helping him until the Samaritan came along.  In Traveling Mercies by Maurice Gray, Matt is beaten and robbed at a rest area while traveling home to North Carolina.  Among the people at the rest area are a minister on his way home from a revival, a gospel choir with a schedule to keep and a prostitute.  A crowd of people witnesses the attack, but only one person stops their journey to help Matt.  This least likely stranger stays with him at the hospital and helps him get back on his feet.<br />In I Samuel 1:10-18, the handmaiden Hannah prayed to the Lord for a manchild and the Lord heard her plea.  Yes, God does answer prayers in His own time.  In Victoria Christopher Murray's offering The Best of Everything, Hannah wants a child more than anything else in the world.  She and her husband Brandon have been married for two years and she cannot figure out why she is not pregnant, after all, he has four other children from his former marriage.  Hannah's obsession with having a child jeopardizes her marriage and her faith begins to waiver.  Hannah learns she must appreciate all that she already has to be in the will of God.<br />You can also read the modern day stories of Samson and Delilah by S.

This romantic tale between Sage Dunbar and Gabe Blackwell deals with issues of trust and how to get on with life and get into another relationship.<br />Sage Dunbar is dealt a double whammy.  She is engaged to marry Erol Carlson, her first love and the man with whom  she had a five-year relationship.  When he depletes her bank accounts without her knowledge on an investment scheme gone badly, Sage calls off their engagement and severs all ties with him.  Later, that same day, she sees her father whom she held in the highest regard, at a restaurant with a woman who is not her mother.  These two incidents causes Sage to question everything she believes in about love and marriage.  To get away from it all and clear her head, she accepts a job transfer many miles away.  Gabe Blackwell swore off of relationships and love after his almost fiance dumps him to go back to her former lover.  He submerges himself in work and only seeks out female companionship for sexual release.  When Sage and Gabe meet in Anchorage, Alaska to work on the Landmark project, Eden, there is electricity between the two of them that can not be denied. But with both of them carrying so much emotional baggage they are unable to see what is so obvious to everyone else.<br />This is  the first time in reading one of Ms. Jacksons books that there is a female protagonist that I had a hard time liking.  I found Sage to be self righteous, unforgiving and unyielding.  Gabe deserves a medal for hanging in there with her.  Having a story set in Alaska in itself is unique. I wish more scenery and description of the area and its attractions made their way into the storyline. Alaska is such a beautiful place.

Lenox has money and all the right connections with the Lyncs, a social organization, and his aunt, Ms. Meyers, who is also Farah?s boss.  Lenox also has lots of problems; his friends expect him to ?fix? their problems using his connections, some of them mistake his kindness for weakness, but the biggest problem is Maritza, a woman that can turn this  fairytale relationship into a nightmare.<br />Use Me or Lose Me is a fun read.  There are interesting characters and exotic locales. The vacation to St. Tropez is worthy of note. Both Farah and Lenox are very pretentious; therefore designer name-dropping fit the character?s manner and did not take anything way from the story.  Farah even goes as far as to purchase Gucci-wear for her infant goddaughter.  I think the readers will enjoy some surprises in the storyline and the ending.  I recommend adding this to your reading list.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-07-25

Alexander began writing to express to society the power of educating people about realistic, everyday issues by way of story.  In her novel, Through the Storm, domestic violence is rampant and its ramifications are horrific.  Two marriages are being followed in this dark and disturbing story.  Libby and Jim Brown are a happy couple awaiting the birth of their first child.  Their neighbors are Silva and Tigga.  Against Jim's wishes, Libby befriends Silva, a victim of Tigga's constant fury.  Libby tries to encourage Silva to flee this situation, but Silva will not leave the man no matter what he does and no matter the consequences.  All Libby and Jim can do is watch in horror as Silva is repeatedly victimized by Tigga and offer a safe haven for the children when the need arises. <br />Domestic violence is a difficult subject but Through the Storm is written in such clarity, you can feel the pain of Silva.  You can also feel Libby and Jim's frustration of trying to help someone that does not want to be helped.  Throughout the story the author switched from first person to third person and changed point of views frequently.  This happened so often it became distracting.  There were also problems with typos and inconsistency in the use of character names.  Despite these problems it was a commendable effort. <br />Jeanette<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-07-17

When their mother committed suicide, they had to leave their home in New York and move to New Orleans with their aunt Pearl who assumed  responsibility for the  girls. In Yvette D. Stewart's debut novel, Behind the Cypress, she weaves a story of mental and physical abuse and also murder.  <br />Marie Bensen had a wonderful marriage to a wonderful man.  Everything was going along well until Marie's sudden personality change. No one, even her husband, could figure out what was going on with Marie and eventually her aloofness drove them apart.  In order to deal with her troubling problem, Marie tries to harm herself before finally revealing the problem to her sister, that she received a letter from their aunt Pearl who wanted to make amends with them.   In order to move forward, the girls had to relive the past and learn to forgive. .   The author alternates between the past and present as she explains the actions of the characters, and Marie begins her healing process. <br />This was an admirable offering for a debut novel.  The history of the characters was captivating and intriguing. There were some problems with making the transition between the past and present in that the change was sometimes abrupt.  The ending, tied up neatly, was a little unrealistic in that the sisters were so forgiving so quickly considering all the abuse they suffered.  I found this quick read  to be a good first effort and look forward to reading more by this author. .<br />Jeanette<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-07-16

Set in rural Mission, Georgia until their move to New Jersey, the lives of the Walker family is followed as they trust God to fight their battles when the going was tough.<br />Solomon Walker's father died unexpectedly when he was a young child. His father taught him many life lessons.  One important message that his father passed on to him was \\"not to trust anyone but family\\" and  Solomon took these words and instructions seriously.  When his mother became ill and trusted a friend to care for his triplet sisters, in his heart, Solomon knew this was not the right thing to do. His worse fears are realized when he goes to bring  the triplets, Magnolia, Hyacinth and Rose, back home and they cannot be found.<br />Thirty-eight years later, Magnolia is married to Anthony and they live in New Jersey.  On a business trip to Miami, Anthony  sees a lady he mistakes for Magnolia, only to find out she is Hyacinth.  With the help of Hyacinth's parents, bits and pieces of the past are brought to light and these two sisters are reunited.  Rose is still missing and  they are wondering about the rest of their siblings and mother.  An appearance on a television show that reunites families might be the answer, or the answer could be staring them right in the face.<br />My actual rating for this book was a 3.5.  I enjoyed the uniqueness of the story. It is not often that you get to see beyond the hugs and tears of the television reunion stories. There are twists with some of the characters that will have you guessing about their connection to the triplets.  However, I found the unearthing and meetings between the missing links to be drawn out so much so I started skimming through the back of the book to find out the answers.  I think this was a good first effort and look forward to reading more of this author's work.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub/>Jeanette<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-07-08

In Debra Phillips debut novel, The High Price of a Good Man, she allows the proud full-figured Queenisha or Queenie  to tell the story of how she became the woman of superfine Zeke Washington, and how she deals with her Latino gourmet admirer Raymo.  Not only is Queenie trying to establish a relationship with Zeke but she also has as her best friend Poetta, a candle burning, put a voodoo hex on you woman. The adventures of Queenie and Poetta are just as amusing as the budding relationship storyline.<br />In the beginning of the book, Queenie comes on as a strong, not going to take any mess off a man woman.  She is a big girl and proud of it. She is secure with herself and has a good job and stable finances.  She does not need a man to take care of her, she just wants one to love and call her own.  When she wins a date with Zeke Washington she decides he is the man of her dreams and she pulls out all stops to get him.  She uses this same aggressiveness to try to make her admirer Raymo leave her alone, but he will not take \\"no\\" for an answer.  However, for Poetta she will do anything or can be manipulated into doing things she does not want to do, like drive Poetta to Arizona so she can make amends to her dead lover's widow.<br />Queenie and Poetta, though crazy at times, are quite likeable characters as well as the pathetic Raymo. There are interesting twists and turns in the story, most of them are funny like Zeke's roommate, Sweet Willie, and Brooda, the wheelchair-bound widow of Jimboy, however, the ending is predictable and does not deviate much from most \\"I wanna man stories.\\"  I think if you enjoy the sisterfriends and relationship novels you will enjoy this one.  It can be a quick beach reading experience.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-07-07

When he decides to leave her, she is devastated.  For years, Indira has harbored anger towards her deceased mother for staying in an abusive marriage, but finds herself doing the same thing.  Maxine is searching for  \\"Mr. Right.\\"  When she meets Bruce, she thinks she has found him but to her dismay he is married. After their breakup she is left with an unexpected gift.  Maxine was raised by her grandmother who loved her unconditionally, because her mother chose heroin over her. When her mother becomes ill, Maxine has to put aside the past.  Finally, there is Sydney;  she is still  in love with Anthony, her \\"Baby's Daddy\\" who has been absent for the past two years.  Her undying love for him prevents her from establishing any other relationship.  Also suffering is Sydney's relationship with her mother.  Her mother was so distraught over Sydney's pregnancy and relationship with Anthony; she has not spoken to Sydney for two years, even though they see each other every Sunday at church.<br />This book could have benefited from good editing.  There were problems with time frames that did not add up. The story was told in mostly dialogue, and this reader was often lost as to who was talking due to  confusing point of view changes.  There were also distracting typos.  From chapter seventeen to the end of the book, the writing style changed and became much clearer when the  author used  narration and dialogue to convey the story.  I commend my fellow Cass Tech alumni for her gumption to write and publish a novel which is a difficult task.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-07-01

Adrienne and James lived together for ten years before deciding  to get married. The wedding is four months away when Adrienne has a chance encounter with Daniel Pierce.  Although the relationship with James is lukewarm at best, Adrienne is committed to this man she loves and brushes Daniel off.  Coincidentally, Daniels shows up at several places where Adrienne frequents, at the horse stables, at a nightclub and on the streets of Washington D.C. Eventually, Daniel wears her down and they become friends.  A touch here, a look there and a confession by Daniel makes Adrienne doubt her relationship with James.  After a fight with James, and Adrienne finding no support from her best friend Charlene or her mother, she seeks solace with her friend, Daniel.<br />The author stayed mainly to the love triangle storyline, but provided  a tease on a story  about Adrienne's best friend Charlene, and Charlene's relationship with her mother. This storyline would have  been interesting and may have brought more substance to the book. However, it was mentioned in passing at the end of the book, with no time to expound.  For the most part the book was well written, but typos were found in the last few pages making it appear as if the author rushed to finish the book.  For those who like the relationship genre, this is a quick and predictable read.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-06-27

They could be the member who feels that since they give the most money they should have the most say; a busybody church mother, a deacon who sits quietly watching and when the time is right doles out words of wisdom,  or a \\"saved\\" brother who is abusing his wife behind closed doors.  In Michelle Andrea Bowen's sophomore novel Second Sunday, she exposes all these secrets and more as she depicts the members of Gethsemane Missionary Baptist church.<br />The church is in trouble when their philandering pastor, Rev. Clydell Forbes, Sr. dies and the church is getting ready to celebrate its 100th anniversary.  It is now up to the deacon board to find a new pastor quickly. The men take on this task, leaving the women out of the decision-making process, so they take matters into their own hands.  The women approach  Sheba Cochran, a \\"loose\\" Christmas and Easter attending member, to expose the undesirable pastoral candidates. When Sheba meets Rev. George Wilson and he does not fall prey to her advances, they know they have found the right man. Not only is he right for the church, but Sheba could be the right woman for him.  The bigger problem is stopping those who would oppose him for their own gain.<br />Set in St. Louis, Missouri in the 1970's, pastel colored leisure suits and platform shoes were the fashion craze for men. Just picturing  their wardrobes \\"... a powder blue leisure suits, a black silk big-collared shirt, a silver chain and a black suede hat....\\"  was hilarious. The antics of the church members made for laugh out loud moments; the scene at the American Worship Center was classic.  Ms. Bowen updated the readers on some of the favorite characters from Church Folks as they made cameo appearances throughout the book.  Overall, I applaud Ms. Bowen on continuing to provide a humorous and spiritual peek at the inside workings of the African American church.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-06-20

They work, play baseball, dance at The Say When, celebrate Juneteenth, worship at Mount Calvary Baptist Church and fall in love.  When they have the misfortune of encountering a white person or run into the racist sheriff, they are stripped of their  manhood/womanhood, as they have to bite their tongues and bow down while the \\"superior\\" ones degrade them.<br />The Pettiway and Johnson families are pillars of the community. Their children, James Pettiway and Mattie Johnson, play a cat and mouse game with love.  When Mattie becomes pregnant they have to marry.  They continue to reside in the community until James becomes fed up with the racism and its ramifications.  His friend, St. Elmo, makes plans to  flee the prejudice in the South and  find work in the shipyards in California.  James sees this plan as a way of making a new start and leaves with him for California,<br />Once Mattie and the children are on the train traveling to California to become reunited with James, the book takes a strange turn. On one page we read  Mattie and the boys are on a train in St. Louis heading west.  The next chapter starts in slavery times and proceeds though post Civil War.  The Pettiway's family tree is presented from Caesar to Aaron Pettiway.  While there were interesting historical facts about the Negro soldiers leading the fight at Port Hudson, I could not understand why the drastic change in the storyline, and why at this point in the book.  Otherwise, while not much action, it was a good read about the residents of the Quarters and their day to day survival in a world that was against them.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-06-19

In True Lies, Margaret Johnson Hodges takes a subject that could have been made into drama and more drama and develops a story about the  hard decisions that characters have to make. The decisions that may make or break a relationship.<br />In this love triangle, on the apex is Rick.  A hard working man, trying to do the right thing, take care and support his young daughter, Kanisha.  On one end of the triangle is Gina, his young, non-caring, neglectful baby mama.  She would rather go party than stay at home and be a mom.  On the other end is Dajah, a woman who on the surface seems to have it altogether. She meets Rick the same day she gets her heartbroken by a relationship gone badly.  At this time, Rick is tiring of Gina but is concerned enough for his child to stay in a relationship that is unhealthy.  When Gina messes up for the last time, he drops her off at her mother`s home and begins a serious relationship with Dajah.  Then, the Baby Mama Drama starts and continues as each of the major players fights for what they want.<br />I appreciate how Johnson-Hodges takes this controversial subject and presents it without extreme craziness. Instead, she allows the reader in delve into the inner person and explores why they do the things they do.  There are great secondary characters like Freida, Dajah's workaholic friend and Tarika, Gina's best friend who had the gumption to go after a better life.  As always Margaret Johnson Hodges has given readers a well written, interesting and captivating novel that is highly recommended.<br />Motown Review Book Club	2003-06-10

Would the Lord really place someone in her life who her family is against and who is so different from her?  She struggles to believe God even when His word has been confirmed.<br />Courtney is a graduate of Northwestern University.  She has returned to Philadelphia to work in a Marketing firm.  College friend Sebastian Whittington, III, moves to  Philadelphia to attend law school. His ulterior motive is to be close to Courtney and to establish a serious relationship with her.  The big problem is Sebastian is white and her family members, especially Aunt Sis hates white people and can never accept Sebastian.  The shoe is also on the other foot, and Sebastian's family will not accept Courtney either.  These oppositions do not stop Sebastian from claiming what he feels God has for him, however, Courtney is very uncomfortable with the relationship.  Both have to depend on their strong faith and relationship with God to help them through this matter.<br />My biggest complaint is that I would have rather the characters tell the story than be told the story in a lot of narration.  I thought the twist regarding Sebastian's heritage was a bit of a stretch and unnecessary. Ms Haley does a good job of exploring the ramifications of interracial dating. I liked the other different storylines regarding  police brutality, and the relationship between Courtney and her cousins and family. I am sure those who are in an interracial relationship or contemplating one will find words of encouragement in this novel and find it quite enjoyable.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-06-05

The protagonist, Nyagra Ensley suffers through a series of bad relationships.  Her problem is she bases the man's potential on his economic status and job position instead of what is in their hearts.  Time after time she is disappointed.  After the last big disappointment, she takes a vacation by herself to Niagara Falls to meditate on her life. She discovers things about herself that she does not like and vows to make some positive changes.

Nyagra's best friend Trish, her sister Juanita and her mother try to provide wisdom and reality checks, but Nyagra is very strong willed. This aspect of her personality almost makes her lose the best thing that has come her way in a long time.<br />Although there were some problems with redundancy, I was pleasantly surprised with the message and theme of this book. Initially, I thought this book was going to be one of those drama filled \\"he done me wrong\\" kind of reads, but it was nothing of the sort.  A reader could surely learn a lesson or two from this debut author offering.  I would recommend this book to put on your summer reading list.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-06-05

In A Lova' Like No Otha' by Stephanie Perry Moore, storms are raging quite a bit in the life of Zoe, usually when God is trying to tell her something.<br />After being jilted at the altar by Devyn, then crying and beseeching the Lord, Zoe ends up at Devyn's apartment, being comforted by Chase Farr, Devyn's best friend and roommate. He allows her to stay at the apartment and helps her through this trying time.  From this point the story gets a little unbelievable and things happen very fast. Zoe finds herself attracted to Chase and wants a relationship with him. They move to Seattle to follow Chase's dream of being a pro football player.  Both Chase and Zoe profess to be Christians, with Chase being much more committed than Zoe. Zoe does some things that are against Chase beliefs and he ends their relationship. Zoe returns home, but is called back to Seattle for a job and hopefully back into Chase life.<br />In this Christian novel Zoe and Chase sought the Lord regularly when the storms of life became too much for them to bear alone.  While they had a strong prayer life, they did not attend church, which I found a bit disturbing.  They had no spiritual covering, no guidance except for friends.  It seemed to me that is why Zoe was so weak.  I just could not find a way to like or feel compassion for Zoe as I found her to be fickle and immature.  There are good strong messages throughout the book that would be valuable to the population it was intended for, teenagers and young adults.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-06-05

During the week, all sort of things are happening.  Annie Eliza's children are having problems, there is a big shakeup in Atlanta politics, a mysterious illness and a suicide.  Annie Eliza finds herself in the middle of all this while Junebug appears to be oblivious to it all but just goes along on the adventures to make his aunt happy.<br />This story is narrated by Annie Eliza and has a folksy feel to it. It is just like she invited you in for a cup of coffee while she tells you what happened during the week Junebug stayed at her house.  Annie Eliza remembers every detail of that week, down to what TV show she was watching, what commercial was showing to what outfit she wore to whatever event.  If you ever sat and listened to stories told by your elders, you know when they get on a roll; they tell you a present tense story but have to go back into the past for it to make sense. Imagine getting all this information, pertinent or not, in a narrative; it makes for some intense reading. The characterizations were sometimes funny and usually right on point.  By the time Annie Eliza finished with their story, you knew all about everyone, at least Annie Eliza's opinion of them.  Hidden in all the narrative about the family is a mystery of which Annie Eliza vows to get to the bottom of.  Overall, this was a good read.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-05-26

In this story, a grown man cries and if you get caught up in this story you will cry with him for the injustices faced by the characters in this novel.  The novel is set in a rural town in Louisiana that still has an old southern atmosphere. The black people are still not respected and white reigns supreme.<br />Upon his release from a ten-year stint in the state prison, Tyrone returns home only to find out his son Marcus has been charged with murder and scheduled to be put to death in a matter of days.  Tyrone knows his son could not have committed the crime of which he was charged; he is too soft for that kind of violence.  Tyrone seeks out the attorney who represented Marcus and has the audacity to question his handling of Marcus's case. Tyrone takes it upon himself to re-investigate the case and finds evidence that were overlooked during the initial trial and investigation.  While conducting his investigation, Tyrone also has to contend with his sisters, mother, probation officer, in-laws and an emotionally fragile wife.  Some of them are supportive of him and his actions; but others are waiting for him to slip up and return to old habits and eventually prison.<br />I am glad I gave this book a chance as it is one I probably would not have picked up on my own, but read it because it was a book club selection.  The book starts off slow, like a hot lazy day in Louisiana, and as the sun goes down and cools things off, the action of the people speeds up just as the action of the book gradually gains momentum.  The dialogue was crisp and as a reader I felt as if I was eavesdropping on intimate conversations between the characters.

None of the Shepherd women were very religious so for them to develop a relationship with God was a learning process.<br />Faith: All the Shepherd women went to church at some time in their life, but none really had experienced a relationship with God. Marley did not like going to church, found it to be pretentious, until she visited Gilead's Balm Church.  The message Marley heard that Sunday was directed at her and she gave her life over to God.<br />Trust: In order to be in a relationship, you have to trust the other person.  In your relationship with God, you have to trust that His word is true and if He promised you He would bless you, He will do it.  Pam found this to be true as she battled a serious illness.<br />Love: The Shepherd women loved each other, but did not know how to show this love.  Ma Grand did not display affection to her daughter, which made her feel unloved, and since she did not have a positive mothering example, Pam's relationship with Marley suffered.  Marley thought herself in love with Gerrard, her ex-fiance, was able to discover true love once she met Lazarus.<br />This novel will make you think about putting your problems in God's hands and leaving them there.  Marley saw her problematic situations change for the better; Pam experienced the healing virtues of God and Ma Grand learned it is okay to show love and affection to those close to her.  I appreciated the author's practicality in writing about how the characters made progressive changes and mistakes in their Christian walk.  There were good secondary characters that enhanced the main characters.  I think people who enjoy Christian novels will enjoy this realistic rendition of newfound Christianity.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-05-08

Imagine a parent losing a child in a fire, and everyday having to live with the guilt that you are at fault.  Mel and Adrienne Jordan are living this nightmare and their lives are a mess.  They briefly separate after the child's death and when their guilt and grief become too much to bear, they turn away from each other and to addictions as a means to escape the pain.  Mel reverts  to his old life style of womanizing and drugs.  Adrienne turns to shopping and excessive spending leading to unmanageable credit card debts. The couple struggles to get out of the downward spiral with the help of Adrienne's brother, Dan, her  sister in law, Charlene, and Mel's sister, Debra.  Add a mysterious Lloyd Cooper to the mix and you have a little drama in the story.<br />This story is real and the situations are told in a way that you will have an array of emotions.  There are times you will feel some compassion for the couple, and other times disgust when they are in a self-destructive mode.  My only problem with the book is that I was waiting on something extreme to happen or some kind of twist in the storyline that would have made me say WOW! I did not get that, but a rather matter of fact well-told story, with few surprises and predictable outcomes.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-05-06

In this book, Thomas looks at the life of four markedly different women who work at St. Paul Human Services.  Each has her own relationship with God and lives her life accordingly.<br />Sabrina does not believe in anything except for the almighty dollar and men who can make her fantasy life come true; the richer the better.  Tangie knows about God and goes to church, but she does not feel worthy of Him because of her addiction.  Bonnie is a widow and is extremely lonely.  She has a strong relationship with God and is very active in her church. She always has an encouraging word for those who want to hear it.  Cordelia (Dee) is divorced and the mother of a teenage daughter.  She appears to have the strongest faith among the women but when several devastating chain of events happen in her life, she becomes angry and is unable to practice what she has preached for so long.<br />I have read many of Ms Thomas work and have enjoyed them all. However, in this book there seemed to be a lack of intensity in the character's emotions.  I read that Dee was angry and hurt by the things happening in her life, but I did not feel the anger and the hurt coming from the character.  She appeared to be upset, not angry.  I knew Bonnie was lonely, but the character appeared to be okay with it, she made some exciting changes, but did not seem excited.  I think what I was looking for was the characters to state in dialogue and show in actions their feelings, instead of being told what they were feeling by the author.<br />I believe the best of Christian fiction will have the reader thinking about what was written and how it can affect one's walk in Christianity.  Thomas starts A Change is Gonna Come with the scripture Psalms 73 when David speaks of how his foot almost slipped when he saw the prosperity of the wicked.  This scripture was so appropriate for this book, for it seemed as if the more wicked the character was, the better things were for them, Sometimes it seems the grass looks greener on the other side but you just hold on to the promises of God, a change will come. Thomas did an excellent job of breaking down this scripture in the lives of these women.  That is what made this reading pleasurable.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClubmed as if the more wicked the character was, the better things were for them, Sometimes it seems the grass looks greener on the other side but you just hold on to the promises of God, a change will come.

In Atlanta Live, author Carmen Green takes a break from her romance writing to bring the reader into the word of talk radio and the lives of the hosts Dr. Jasmine, Malone and Evelyn.  Dr. Jasmine is harsh, sarcastic and sometimes brutally blunt to the callers.  Evelyn is more patient and caring to the callers and Malone is the balance between the two women and has the \\"back\\" of all the men.  One morning the trio receives a disturbing phone call from Lindsay, a distraught teenager.  Her subsequent action causes controversy at the station and in the lives of the characters.<br />While the hosts appear to have it all together on the outside, a glimpse inside their lives tells a different story.  Unhappiness, insecurity, baby mama drama, unfulfilled dreams and poor decisions are prevalent in their lives.  They try to stick together to see each other through the bad times but one of them is unable to take a back seat and sets out to destroy the others for their own gain.  But what is done in the dark always seems to come back and haunt you in the light.

Set in picturesque New Orleans, each romance has its own unique story and in the end it all combines for another successful reading experience provided by Ms Ray.<br />Art historian Kristen Mayfield finds herself pining away for elusive carpenter, Rafe Crawford. Rafe finds himself wanting to return the feeling, but he is fighting demons of his past with an abusive father.  Kristen does not give up, and sets out to make Rafe see that he is capable of giving and receiving love.<br />Angelique is Kristen's next door neighbor and best friend. She is as beautiful as she is smart.  When Damien Broussard walks into his father's art gallery and sees Angelique, he is ready to put aside his playa card and get to know this lady, that is until he finds out she is associated with the Inferno, a gentlemen's club.  Going on assumption about Angelique instead of finding out the truth, he almost destroys a fulfilling relationship.<br />The very wealthy insurance mogul Claudette Thibodeaux Laurent is married to the unscrupulous Maurice Laurent.  He only sees dollar signs and Claudette  appears to be blind to his behavior and only  interested in \\"keeping the family honor.\\" Everyone sees that Claudette is hurting and Maurice only cares about her money.  A friend ,Jacques Broussard, is just waiting on the sidelines to step in and show Claudette what real love is.<br />In all of Ms Ray's writings she possess a skill that draws the reader into the lives of each character.  She tells this story with modest sexual interactions, romance, and laugh out loud humor and compassion.  At times Rafe's brooding and dark outlook on life became a little cumbersome, but I will still highly recommend this book.

The antics and violence portrayed by the characters JC, Peanut, Rat and the others may be commonplace in their world, but it seemed surreal to me.<br />The action takes place in Chicago. The reader is first introduced to JC, Jonathan Collins, who is looking forward to his release from prison after serving ten years. He  used his time in prison to harbor his anger and to plan revenge for those who put him there. From the day he is released, he seeks to destroy Richkid, Zo and Lil G; the ones who betrayed him.  Unfortunately, Richkid and Lil G were taken care of by other means so JC only had to concentrate on ruining Zo, the top drug dealer in the area.  With the help of his companions, Champagne, Rat and Shaunna, they wreak havoc on Zo's empire, leaving him wondering who is trying to take over his territory.  The crew is an anonymous force working quietly and in the background, before JC reveals himself to Zo and Lil G at the very end.<br />This book is told in a mostly narrative form.  It could have been more stimulating had the characters told the story using dialogue and actions rather than the author narrating. I felt as if I were listening to  someone  telling me what had happened, rather than experiencing it.  However, it was an interesting read with some very interesting characters.  There was good character development.  The protagonist JC was very well developed and was portrayed as both a bad guy and a good guy.

Shipp's Send Me a Stranger to Love, she writes of a relationship between Valerie Parker and Michael Patereau.  Valerie has not had a relationship in six years when she by chance meets Michael, the man who sends her 10-year-old car to an early grave after a fender bender.  Valerie is also living with the disease Lupus, which requires some extra care and understanding in having a  relationship.  Close to Valerie are her two friends, Lily and Gwen and her family, both in California and Philadelphia, all who play a major role in Valerie's life.  This relationship has moments of romance, complacency and turbulence throughout.  Many times one or the other would do something so crazy you would wonder why they stay together and then do something so nice you will wish they were your partner.<br />This book read as if it could have come straight from the author's own personal  journal; I wondered if it was an autobiography.  The only thing missing were the dates.  The sequence and time frames were very consistent to the point of the author specifying when \\"it was an uneventful week\\".  Where there was action the author detailed everything from the clothing worn and conversations that transpired.<br />The relationship between Valerie and Michael is interesting enough to keep the readers attention despite it reading like a diary.  There is a lot of valuable information on the disease Lupus, that I found quite interesting considering I have family members who have this disease.  I think if you live in the Bay Area you may find many familiar places or restaurants you frequent as their descriptions are sprinkled throughout the book.  While this book was not a bad read, it did not leave a lasting impression  whereas I would make an unsolicited recommendation.  If someone were to ask me specifically about this book, I would say yes read it, you may enjoy it.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2003-03-31

If you were living in the 23rd century or in the year 2268, this would be your norm.  a.a. clifford AKA Gary Hardwick presents this and much more in his futuristic sci/fi novel, SexLife.<br />In the year 2268, all people have a disease known as CMB. The men's fingers start twitching and women get headaches. They must have sex or die. In New City, formerly New York City, philosopher Joe meets his requirements by having sex with various partners.  Sex is emotionless and done without deriving any pleasure; just a means of survival. No one believes in real sex anymore.  Joe meets a lady named Vella and they experience the unexpected during intercourse where they were just \\"fixing\\" each other.  After this experience Joe becomes obsessed with having this woman and experiencing this feeling again.  But this obsession is dangerous. If the government finds out about it they will want to do laboratory testing on the couple. Vella is married and it is illegal to get a divorce.  In spite of this  Joe is determined to have this woman and uses friends and situations to his advantage to have this feeling in his life forever.<br />This was one of the most imaginative books I have read in a while.  It was a little tough going in the beginning learning the acronyms and  technical  workings of life in this particular century. Once that was made clear, I read the rest of the novel with anticipation.  The action was not as fast paced as Gary Hardwick's thrillers but it was just as intense and exciting.

Clarke that this book was a lot of her dreams on being a best selling author and how she hopes this goal comes to fruition.  While different storylines are going in the book, one of the main stories is how she meets her favorite author Dean Koontz and he gives the protagonist a book that advises her on how to achieve the status of being a best selling author.  This book also has some extraordinary powers associated with it that is not all good.<br />The main character Kurt Daley is an aspiring horror suspense author.  She is also employed in an office and has several close friends who work in the office.  Somehow their lives find its way into Kurt's book though she writes about the events before they happen.  All of these coincidences spook Kurt and she finds the only way to rid herself of this negative force is to return the book to Dean.<br />It appears that the author wanted to appeal to all readers so she covered the main genres of sisters/friends, romance, and a little mystery. The main character was writing a sci-fi novel and the snippets that were present in the fictional book, Passion's Frenzy were actually more interesting than the book itself.  I wish that story could have been expounded on more.  I had some problems with some of the actions in the book being believable.  In one instance the character had been shot, had surgery and was hospitalized.  Never once did she mention family until it was time for her to go home and then she and her son walked out of the hospital and into a waiting car.  No wheelchair, no nurse, they just walked out of the hospital.  Another was when Kurt was going out on a date.  Why would one get all dressed, put on her make-up and heels, then strip the bed and put on new linen.  Wouldn't you do that before you got dressed?  The  characterization of the sisters/friends  and the romantic scenes between Kurt and Robert Earls were good.  Initially, I rated this book a 2.5 on the APOOO scale, but I think it has enough potential to warrant a 3 rating.  As Ms Clarke hones her skills with other novels she already has in the works, maybe one day she will put out a best selling novel.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClubthe APOOO scale, but I think it has enough potential to warrant a 3 rating.

This time they explored the budding relationship of Zaria Chance and Kenneth Roman in the novel In Love and War.<br />When the opinionated, out-spoken  and unforgiving Zaria is paired with the quieter, sensitive and conservative Kenneth, sparks are sure to fly.  The couple gets off on the wrong foot immediately, when Kenneth tries to talk to Zaria about her son at a parent teacher conference and his approach is all wrong.  Zaria flies off the handle, berating him and his teaching abilities and later realizes she does not even know what the problem was.  In fact, Zaria jumps to conclusions a lot without giving others a chance to explain.  Zaria and Kenneth also have to explore their feelings on single parenthood, when to introduce their children to dates and the dynamics of  teacher/parent dating.<br />It is very interesting to have both sides present their point of views during the courtship  and their thoughts and reactions to the actions of each other.  The New Year's Eve scenes illustrates this exceptionally well.  Unlike in their previous work of fiction Love Don't Live Here Anymore, this couple is not married and have a life outside of the relationship so this book is not as repetitive in each member replaying the same scene.  Kenneth's life as a basketball coach and his concern for his players is another story within this book.  Zaria's relationship with her children, sister (Mikki is back) and friends are also prominent storylines.  The story is told in a humorous, sensitive and thought-provoking manner.  I would definitely recommend this book for book clubs as I can foresee it causing a very enlightening discussion.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub<br />Motown Review Book Club	2003-03-17

Each story depicts a young person in turmoil, learning a lesson or seeking an answer to life's questions.<br />In Speaking In Tongues, young Tia runs away from her overly strict aunt and church to search for her mother in Atlanta.  As with most runaways, she is easily targeted by an area pimp. However her values forces her to fight her way out of his grasp, though there are close calls when it looked as if she would falter.  In Brownies, a group of young  girl scouts, lead by bullies Arnetta and Octavia, seeks to fight a white Brownie troop who are also at camp due to trumped up charges that they called one of the girls the \\"N\\" word.  Only they  find out the group is made up of developmentally disabled Brownies.  The Ant of the Self is the only story featuring a male main character. Spurgeon can barely stand to be in the presence of his father, Ray Bivens, Jr.  After bailing his father out of jail, Spur is attempting to drive him back to Indiana when Ray coerces him into driving to Washington, DC to the Million-Man March.  Spur would rather be back at school participating in the debate team competition.  Even after hearing the speeches at the March, Spur and his father still can not see eye to eye and can not improve their relationship.<br /> Reading a collection of short stories is a rare experience for me, but this was an enjoyable one.  Each offering is complete and as a reader I was satisfied with each story; not needing them to be any longer or wishing they were a complete book. Each short story offers a lesson and  a different perspective on life.  Though many of the characters are rural women with very strict religious backgrounds, the author does a wonderful job of developing them all with their own taste of individuality.

The black students at the school want to bring a well-known anti-Semite to speak at the school and expect Darius to support them and when he does not he is labeled an \\"Uncle Tom\\".

They will lie, cheat and steal for their own self-gratification.  They are rich, striving to be rich, working class and poor.  One thing all the characters have in common is a love/hate relationship with Lyric Devaney.<br />Lyric knew at an early age that she wanted to be rich and well connected.  In her own words, she proclaimed she would be the next Jacqueline Kennedy.  Her method of achieving this goal was to surround herself with all the right people, and when they did not do what she wanted them to, she resorted to backhanded measures to make them comply. There were two women who considered Lyric to be their best friend.  Portia Jones hailed from Brooklyn.  She was the only person whom Lyric would admit  she was afraid of, at least initially.  Portia tried to hold her own against Lyric, but when Lyric wore Gucci she wore \\"Ucci\\".  Madison Michaels was  very naive and easily manipulated by those who professed to love her.  She was a law school student and a paralegal in the District Attorney's Office. Joshua Tune was her boss and a close friend.  Joshua Tune was the District Attorney who had everything going for himself,  but had trouble staying faithful to his wife and keeping his nose away from the white powdery stuff.  While not really a good friend of Lyric's, he was connected to her because of his relationship with Madison.<br />There was an assorted cast of characters and outrageous scenes that made this reading exciting and hard to put down.  This story will draw you in, have you talking to or in my case screaming at characters to not be so \\"doopid\\", and just waiting for others to get what is coming to them.  While I actually gave this book a 3.5 on the APOOO rating scale, the constant conflicts among the characters and the unexpected twists and turns in the plot made this an enjoyable reading experience.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub>Jeanette <BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-01-02

Eric's debut novel, A Place in Heaven, depicts life in Atlanta GA during the 1950's and 1960's for best friends, Sadie McCalister and Ella Washington.  Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Movement play an important role in their lives.   Being free to shop anywhere, walk anywhere, vote and be educated like their white counterparts was the dream of the young people in the book.  Sadie's brother Andre grows up to be an outspoken great civil rights leader much to the chagrin of the town's resident KKK man and police chief, Albert Wallace.<br />Ella Washington lived her teenage life in a Victorian mansion, with her aunt, Madam Joyce Washington.  Joyce was mean and abusive to Ella.  When Ella turned thirteen, she became Joyce's employee.   Ella hated every minute of her life there, but she held on to her dream that once she graduated from high school she would leave her aunt's home.  On the other hand, Sadie lived with her widowed mother and brother.  Things  were not easy for them, but they had a loving home.  Sadie was envious of Ella until Ella told her of what really went on at the mansion.  <br />This book provided an excellent history of the Jim Crow era of the south, and the civil rights struggle.  The speeches Andre used to inspire the people were moving. The chief storyline regarding the friendship between Ella and Sadie and the budding romance between Ella and Andre was overshadowed by the civil rights movement storyline.  Several chapters were devoted to minor characters that gave cause to some interesting twists and turns in the plot.   If you are really fascinated by the civil rights movement and life during the Jim Crow era, this may be a book you will enjoy.  <br />Jeanette <BR>APOOO BookClub	2002-12-23

So much so, that I had to have continual dialogue with my book club while reading.  It had me rushing through my job assignments so I could finish reading.

Ebony wants the interview for a chance at a journalism job with the Examiner because it  will help her provide for her family.  Isaiah wants the interview  and job to prove something to his hard-nosed, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist father.  Every time one of them think they have the scoop on a lead for the interview, the other seems to appear out of nowhere and needs rescuing, thus thwarting the chance for an interview.  In all their togetherness, Ebony and Isaiah slowly come to the understanding that the attraction between them may be more important than the interview.<br />This is a fun romance read.  All the drama the characters go through to get the interview and the underlining sexual tension between the characters keeps the reader interested and guessing.  The characters deal with some deep personal family problems. It is not so overwhelming that the reading becomes laborious and Black Gal, Granny Mac's dog is a scene-stealer.

The protagonist, Demeter, uses lucid dreaming as a form of therapy.  She is explaining to her therapist these dreams she is experiencing.  These dreams happen at inopportune times, in which it appears that Demeter has blacked out or traveled from this universe to another place in time.  In her dreams, she meets Marcellus Angelell.  Marcellus is every woman's dream of a mind blowing sexual encounters.  He and Demeter have passionate sexual encounters that will leave your mouth hanging open.  Demeter ends up pregnant every time they make love.  She and Marcellus have a family that she sees only when she is experiencing these lucid dreams.  When not dreaming, Demeter is trying to maintain her sanity, but she can not figure out what is happening to her. She is losing time, months and years after the dreams.  She is an engineer and director of a power company in Georgia.  She is addicted to coffee from Mr. Chaps, the deli owner in her office building, who vows that he is going to marry Demeter one day, even though he is about a hundred years old.  She has co-workers that work her nerves.  Her sister, Percy, is taking care of her, she has a turbulent relationship with her father and her best friend is dead.  A re-occurring theme in the dreams is the appearance of the best friend in different people.  Either they look like her or they have some part of her name, Cynthia Dewey.<br />There are many clues given through out the book that can aid the reader in figuring out some of the dreams, but the finale stretches the story a little further than expected.  Mr. Chaps, coffee, the strange old man, the names Cynthia and Dewey all play an important part in the story.  Much attention is given to details throughout the book.  The colors of the home, sky and surroundings are vivid.  Musical sounds set the mood.  The sense of hot and cold will send chill through you, give you goose bumps, or have you sweating.  If the same attention had been given to the editing, the missing words and  repeated sentences, it would not have been such a distraction.  All in all, I would recommend this book for someone looking for a story featuring erotica and suspense.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClubsense of hot and cold will send chill through you, give you goose bumps, or have you sweating.

However, once I realized it was an intriguing read about the hardships of law school, backstabbing and dating, and the Finale was not the gist of the book, I had a new appreciation for the novel.  The story made more sense and I began to enjoy it better.<br />Raven, Callie, Omar and Keith were all students at the predominately black Monroe Law School.  The four of them became friends and quickly paired into study partners; Raven and Callie, Omar and Keith.  Omar and Callie became a couple, Raven found Senator Michael Joseph and Keith admired and loved one of the ladies from afar.  Raven and Omar were both arrogant, self centered and thrived on the spotlight shining on them.  So when others took the spotlight away, it spelled bad news.  The shining star soon found out, it was not nice to upstage Omar and Raven.<br />The book also featured other interesting secondary characters.  There was bookstore owner Mr. Reese, the tutorial student, Set, a white man in a black college, Brett and a bevy of females belonging to Omar.  These characters brought their own dynamics into the scene, which helped make the story even more interesting.<br />I thought the book was well written.  The mock court scenes were quite fascinating and gave a glimpse of the judicial system at work.  As the evil characters became more wicked and the good became stronger, this book moved up on the rating scale.  Actually I was going to rated the book  a 3.5 on the APOOO scale, but the anticipation in the storyline, pushed it up to a strong 4* read.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2002-11-04

As a young child she was charged with the responsibility to serve as her sister's protector.  Their parents recognized that Rikki was special, but they refused to accept the obvious signs and eventual diagnosis of Rikki. They turned to religion and denial to cope with their daughter.  Therefore Stacy was beating up \\"Stinky Pam\\", taking the blame for things she did not do, putting Rikki's needs before her own, everyone and everything.  It was expected of her, it was ingrained in her, it was the only thing she knew to do.  However, instead of being a help to her, she was an enabler.<br />Rikki finished college and married Dr. Matt Dresden.  Even with her wild, unpredictable behaviors he tried to stick by her side and seek help for her.  Most of the time, Rikki was in complete denial of her disease, having her mother's continual denial and Stacy saving her all the time,  allowed Rikki to spin on in a manic/depressive state for years.  Not even the doctors could help her.  In the attempt to keep the secret and protect Rikki, the family paid the ultimate sacrifice, which could have been avoided.<br />This was a wonderful, compelling read about how mental illness can effect a family and relationships.  It also showed how the reaction of the family can effect the recovery of the victim.  True to many African American families, they more often than naught would turn to religion and denial, than to deal with the problem straightforward.  As a reader, there were times when I would get so frustrated with the family, I had to take a break, but the story was so interesting it kept drawing me back.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has a family member or a friend who suffers from any type of mental illness, and to anyone looking for a good read.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2002-10-30

Sharla is a five-year-old child and Addy is a seventy-year-old woman.  Their lives are joined together when Sharla's mother asks Addy to watch the child for the summer, then abandons her.  Having Sharla in her life and home brought back memories for Addy of her childhood in Rusholme, Ontario, Canada, and later years in Detroit, Michigan and Chatham, Ontario, Canada.  Sharla reminds Addy of her own daughter  that she did not  see grow up.  Although they had a rocky start, Sharla and Addy become friends as Addy bestowed some of her wisdom on Sharla.  Sharla in turn learns to be a loving little girl now free of abuse.<br />Most of the story is Addy reminiscing about her first love Chester Monk, her rape by a family friend, her lonely existence as the town outcast, her marriage, her children, friends and her job at the bakery.  Addy's memories of these good and bad times surface as she dreams during her naps.  While sleeping she has  conversations with her brother, Lil Leam, who served as an advisor and helpmate to Addy.  Unbeknownst to Addy, she is also talking aloud in her sleep and Sharla is taking  in it all.<br />I think the author did a fantastic job of making clear and precise transitions between the past and present.  She includes a little history about the Underground Railroad and the city of Rusholme, a black community in Ontario, Canada.  Her writing style easily engages the reader as the dialogue between the characters tells the story better than anyone else ever could.  This book is highly recommended.	2002-10-03

Her presence at the church makes for some interesting gossip in the small town in which they reside and uncomfortable for the good Reverend and the Deacon Board, especially when she becomes surrogate mother to two bi-racial children.  She provides more fuel for the gossip mill by falling in love with their father, a big, burly white man named Dewey Baxter.  She finds some of her friends will leave her by the wayside and others stick with her, but she also finds some people she has passed by on Vine Street can have her best interest at heart.<br />Besides Ruth, there are some interesting characters in this book.  Fred or \\"Jar-Man\\" can hear God talking to him from a Mason jar.  His words of wisdom encourage Ruth to follow her heart.  Tee and Dee are two little children who will steal your heart as they did Ruth's when you find out about the hardships they had to endure.  Tonya and Naomi are friends who Ruth can depend on sometimes.  Her reluctant ally is Meg, Dewey's mother and another supporter is the school secretary Mrs. Holland.<br />I found this book interesting, especially that a non-African American man could tell the story in an African American woman's voice.  Though some of the generalizations were a little over the top, I found this story funny enough for  laughing out loud moments and touching enough so that I  wanted to wrap my arms around the characters as I felt their pain, confusion and anger.

Who can forget the child abductions and murders in Atlanta in 1979?  It was a fearful and trying time for all, but for the children, who lived in Atlanta, it had to be one of the most frightening things they experienced.  The author Tayari Jones does an excellent job of getting into the minds and thoughts  of the children as they try to process what was happening to these children, and more so when the victim was someone they knew.<br />For the children in this book, Tasha, Rodney and Octavia, being in the fifth grade is hard.  They surely had enough on their minds just with trying to fit in, make friends, puberty, and pleasing their parents.  All the parents are talking about the child murders and trying to figure out how to keep their children safe.<br />Each child story is unique, each living environment different, but with each child there is  that vulnerability which made you just want to wrap your arms around them and shelter them from all that was bad.  This moving novel is one that I will be highly recommending.  I will be on the lookout for future books by this author.	2002-09-02

Brought up to be a God-fearing Christian, Amani takes the word of God and her virginity very seriously.  She and her best friend, Destiny, made a pact to remain virgins until they are married.  Once Amani meets Marley, a star basketball player at UCLA, her strong resolve  is severely tested.  She is faced with  a decision to remain a virgin or give in to temptation and make love to him  before they are married.  As their relationship develops she begins to  feel the  pressure from her boyfriend.  Her youth,  family issues and family secrets  factor into her decision making.<br />Amani and Marley are well developed characters that you will  get to know well.  It is important for me to remember when reading this book that the characters are young, so they do things I found immature, but are expected given their age.  There were several twists and turns to the plot involving the couple but there were not any real surprises and the story was  easy to predict.<br />In this book, Ms Brooks first novel, she has good words of advice for  young people.  She exalts the virtue of being  a virtuous woman and saving yourself until marriage.  A problem this reader foresees is that the message is preachy which may turn off some of the young people she is trying to reach.  There are many scriptures and sermons to back up the message, but it may be too much.  Also, too much emphasis was placed on  describing designer wardrobe and hairstyles of all the characters.  After finishing the book, I could tell you what everyone wore, how they wore their hair, but could not describe any other scenery.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO BookClub	2002-08-16

Now to condense this 654 page book into a few paragraphs.  This can be challenging because there are a lot of characters and a lot of plots, twist and turns.<br />Talcott Warner or Misha as friends and family call him get word that his father the \\"Judge\\" has died of a heart attack.  At the cemetery Uncle Jack confronts him about the \\"arrangement\\", that his father left.  The next day after burying his father, he is confronted by the \\"FBI\\" about this same \\"arrangement\\".  The only problem is that Misha does not know anything about it, the Judge has not shared any information with him.  Misha could think of many secrets that the judge may have held, but which one everyone is looking for is beyond him.<br />Much of the book is devoted to Misha trying to figure out the arrangement.  The only clue is for him to decipher the coded note the Judge left for him at the Vineyard house.  He could only wonder what Double Excelsior means.  He knows it's a chess term but what does it have to do with the arrangement?  In his search for answers, Misha has questions for many of his father's friends who are politicians and are colleagues of his at the Elm Harbor Law School.  In his search for answers, his behavior becomes bizarre which makes family and friends question is sanity.<br />Not only is Misha trying to figure out the arrangement, his wife Kimmer is being considered for Judge in the Court of Appeals and is running against one of Misha's colleagues.  There is evidence of sabotaging his nomination and Misha is suspected.  Misha and Kimmer are in an unhappy marriage and he suspects she is having an affair with her boss.  His sister is convinced the Judge was murdered and is conducting her own investigation into his death.  There are still unanswered questions revolving around his sister, Abby's death decades ago.  People are following Misha; people are turning up dead.  Misha believes all these occurrences are connected to the \\"arrangement\\". It is a wonder Misha is able to hold it all together.<br />This book is long, wordy and the reading very slow.  It takes too long for the climax, whereas, after about page 450 or so, I was getting tired of reading and just wanted answers, the mystery to be solved and the story to end.  Especially since Misha would state he had something figured out and then the reader would have to read another 50-100 pages to find out what it is he has figured out.  For example, he figured out who \\"Angela's boyfriend\\" was and it was about 100 pages before it was revealed, meanwhile we had to read about visitation with his child, graduation day at the Law School and his commencement speech.  Then after all the searching, Misha did just what I thought he would do.  The culprit? Yes, I was surprised.<br />Overall, I thought it was a good read.

Ms Young tells her story of growing up in Louisiana.  She learns life lessons at the feet of her great grandmother, Big Momma, at the table with her grandmother, Honeymoon, and through encounters with her own mother. The author takes each lesson learned and tells a related story that pertains to her childhood.  We watch as Yolanda grows up and makes some mistakes such as buying $500 worth of designer clothes to fit in with her classmates. She learns about following her dreams and not letting dreams die.  She learns the value of family as she sees her family stick together through all kinds of adversities.<br />Often times when a not so famous person write their memoirs, I wonder why they think their story needs to be told.  In this memoir, I think the author gives just enough information to make a person look back and reflect on their life and see how life lessons help shape who they are as adults.  This book brought a lot of memories as I can relate to many of the same experiences in one way or another.  I can remember Sunday evenings in Bible Training Union, going skating after church on Sundays, singing in the youth choir.  The difficulty of trying to fit in with the other children at school, and still trying to maintain your strong Christian values and  upbringing.  Most of all I can remember conversations with my grandmothers and mother that I credit for shaping  my life.<br />This is a wonderful quick enjoyable read and highly recommended!<br />Jeanette Wallington<br />APOOO BookClub	2002-07-22

With Twilight, I could visualize every detail and see the movie in my mind while reading this book.  It's very detailed, lots of characters, colorful imagery and a good cross of narration and dialogue.<br />From the Brazilian set of the movie, The Colony, to the courtroom in L.A. and back to Brazil, Judge Simone Thompson and \\"Sonny\\" Whittaker are destined to be together.  They are bound by a hypnotic force on their first encounter.  The judge knows who Sonny is, but he does not know her and she does not want him to know who she is, because it could jeopardize her job and his divorce/custody battle.  But it seems they can not stay away from each other. They are also bound together because of a stalker named Narcissus, who has made threats to both the Judge and Sonny, along with others who are acquainted with the couple and the movie.<br />The second story in this book is Simone's search for her father.  A person she has never known not even his name.  Even after confronting her mother on numerous occasions his identity remained a secret.  Once the mother  decided to reveal who the father was, she did not tell Simone, but told the father, and he used this information to discredit Simone.<br />While reading this novel, I could picture Billy Dee Williams as Sonny Whittaker, using that silky smooth voice of his to whisper to the judge during their hot and steamy sexual encounters, speak terms of endearment to his children and express anger and frustration to his father in law, attorney and the media.  While the beginning of the book was slow, it took me about 100 pages to get into it, it picks up and the action and suspense kept my attention to the very end.<br />Jeanette<br />APOOO book club	2002-07-11

However, the choir members are fighting amongst themselves and with other demons that can ruin the tour, and prayer and counseling does not seem to work.<br />The choir director, Roger, is having nightmares because of an accident that happened years ago and he keeps getting notes that make him believe his secret is no longer safe.  His cousin and right hand man, Tyrone and his wife, are having marital problems and it seems Roger may be in the center of it all.  Then there is high maintenance Margaret who has been with Roger since college.  She is unhappy, lonely and lovesick.<br />Reverend Vince is the counselor and spiritual advisor to the choir.  He convinces Roger that it may be best to end the tour, and let the members return home and work on their problems.  While the choir looks good, harmonizes well and sounds good, the blessings of God may not be upon them for this endeavor.<br />The description of the choir is kind of how I felt about this book.  The writing is good, the storyline is good but it lacked cohesiveness.  It seems as if the ending was rushed.  Since this was a relatively short book, I wished the author would have taken another 25 pages or so to give us some insight on things that were mentioned in the epilogue.<br />Actually I rated this book a 3.5, but because I felt there was a need for more information, I could not raise the rating to a 4.<br />Jeanette<br />Apooo bookclub	2002-07-11

Each man is fighting his own demons from childhood which is now effecting his life as an adult.<br /> Reggie finds it hard to make a commitment and finds himself following in his mother's footsteps. He finds himself falling for Lila, one of his many women, but he has baggage that he needs to get rid of first and learn about commitment.<br /> Neal wants to have a good marriage, the opposite of what he witnessed between his own parents.  This determination causes him to stay in a marriage that was not fulfilling and try to work things out.

She imparts the wisdom of the Word of God to the family so that they each can find their way.<br />The answers to these questions and so many more can be found in the humorous tale of Married But Still Looking.  Travis Hunter provides a story in which the plot is full of twist and turns, many which will have you laughing out loud and others will have you saying \\"Oh No He Didn`t\\".  He also portrays the men in this novel in a way where at times you will not think much of them, but for every negative aspect, there are two positive aspects.

It's about faith, forgiveness, trust, and the power of prayer, belief in God among other messages.  For me the messages that stood out most were the Power of Prayer and Faith.<br />The premise of the book was that there were 3 women who had or have cancer and how they dealt with their diagnosis and how strong they were in their Faith.  Tina was bitter especially since her husband walked out on her during her cancer.  Connie was accepting of what God had allowed to happen in her life.  She was living life in full and not worrying about tomorrow.  She had complete faith that God could heal her and if He didn't then she would be spending eternity with Him, in a new body, free of Cancer.<br />Karen the protagonist in the book had her belief in the Lord and went to Church, but her Faith was weak.  Her cancer had re occurred and her marriage was falling apart.  During a routine hospitalization and treatment, Karen lost her will to live and ends up in a coma. With the possibility of losing Karen, her husband, Johnny began to see that being married to her was not as bad as he thought. Though being sick, Karen had been a great helpmate to him, and he had not appreciated her.  When the doctors had done all they could, the next thing was to have a prayer session. The Church Mother and her prayer warriors then took over.  The power of these praying women proved to be the best medicine, not only for the physical healing, but spiritual awakening for Johnny.<br />It is my feeling that an author really does their job when they can evoke an array of emotions from the reader.  I did not think I would like Karen initially, but after understanding what she was going through, I began to have empathy for her.  I was cheering for the ladies triumphs and crying during their trials.  This book is a must read for anyone who has or have a illness, knows someone in this predicament, or just need to know that God does answer prayers.

There are also other characters in this novel that provide the missing pieces and contribute greatly to this story.  In this book the action is fast paced and exciting.  This is one you must read this summer.<br />Jeanette Wallington<br />APOOO bookclub	2002-05-30

Cursed with the same name as his father, a famous writer, Michael decides to follow in his father's footsteps.  The unfortunate part is that he does not have the same talent everyone expects him to possess.<br />Enter, Ani, a recluse writer, who wants no part of the fame and fortune of the literary world.  She and Michael concoct a deceptive scheme that will give them both satisfaction.<br /><br /> Joi has starred in Hollywood for a number of years and is now<br />living in Florida with her husband and supporting his political career. There are terrible problems in this marriage, but Joi continually confesses that she loves her husband and wants her marriage to last.<br /><br />Though they led distinctively separate lives, a chance encounter brings Michael and Joi together.  There is an attraction between the two of them that keeps drawing them together.  Things happen that will change their lives forever.<br /><br />Michael's story was very interesting and could have stood on<br />its own, because  Joi could have been anyone.  There is a<br />good cross of narration and dialogue that makes the story flow well and gives the reader the inside track about what makes Michael and Joi tick. I think this is one of Tim McCann's<br />best work.<br />This is one I would recommend for your summer reading.<br /><br /> Jeanette Wallington<br /> APOOO Bookclub	2002-05-13

The wordiness took away some of the pleasure of reading this book.  Believe me when I say the character development was on target.  I felt as if I knew everything about the sisters Nina and Troi to be able to understand why they react as they did to situations.  For that matter Vaughn and Tim also.<br />Troi appeared to have it going on.  A good marriage, a thriving business, a child and a husband who loved her.  She also loved the Lord and was a soloist at church.  What could possibly be wrong in her life.<br />Nina, I kind of had problems with.  She was portrayed as full figured.  Teased about being overweight as a child and overly concerned about her weight as an adult.  But descriptions in the book did not make it appear she had a weight problem. But, anyway, I digress.  She had a string of bad news relationships until she mets Tim, a younger, struggling student.  Can he make her happy.<br />Because their childhood was so foul, these girls were looking for happiness in their adult relationships and sometimes it was hard to come by.  But, they pressed on.<br />Faced with serious crisises, they turn to their church and God for guidance and strength.<br />So if you can stand small print and lots of words, you will find an enjoyable story in Like Boogie on Tuesday.	2002-04-19

I was not really interested in a college book that featured four friends.  I was not interested in reading about their love life or their fraternity.

The Madrias brothers and their friends make for good romanctic and adventurous times.  This story is Ashton's.  He first laid eyes on Netherland about 3 years ago.  He knew she was the one for him, but his problem was to convince her of that fact.  Netherland had vowed never to love a military man, but Ashton just persisted until she decided to give him a chance.  And once she did, it was on from there.  I really like how Ms Jackson keeps us abreast of all her other characters but interweaving them in the story.

At first I was not feeling this book, cause Garvin was getting on my last nerve.  Once I was able to look beyond her controlling and self righeous ways the reading became more pleasurable.  Garvin returns to Jack Creek to wait out an adminstative leave.  She is also there to bring her Meemaw to her senses.  Meemaw has been spending time with a young man named GoGo and Garvin is not having it.  Garvin is also using this time to right the wrongs in everyone elses life but her own.Meemaw, a deeply religious woman insist that everyone in her household go to church on Sunday.  Garvin reluctantly attends and finds out somethings about herself.  Between the preacher's words and Meemaw lessons, Garvin learns some serious lessons.  For that matter, Meemaw teachings could help anyone, even the reader.  This turned out to be a very inspirational book, with a lesson to be learned.	2001-08-03

She was right on target.Now I laughed at the 5 minute stroll of Ms Goldean and the brothel in the funeral home.  But I howled when Ms Essie used the hat pin to stick the women who was trying to hit on her man.Oh, and how could I forget the teeth falling out.  I really liked how Ms Bowen, showed that the young pastor Theo could be passionate to his wife and preach on Sunday mornings full of the spirit.  The characters were colorful and funny.  The descriptions of some of the Sunday mornings services were so real and moving it made me think I was right there praising God with them.Ms Bowen, you did a wonderful job with this one.

The history of Memhis and the Civil Rights Movement there was interesting.  Past and current events kept up with the times in the book.But, I am not sure of the story she was trying to portray.  The family endured tragedy after tragedy.  You could not help but to root for them to overcome.I never did quite understand Isabel.  Needed closure with Wesley.

But, that's neither here or there because this was a good book.  I have read all of EJD books and liked each one. But, this one gives us a chance to see more of how good of a writer EJD is.  I have to think it can not be easy to write a story in first person.  This book had it  excellent dialogue between the characters until you could almost feel as if you were listening in on their conversations.  It was descriptive.  Not only the sex scenes, but the area and the characters.  I could picture Nicole's mother so vividly I could have named her.  You did notice she did not have a name either?  The story was different.  I must say, the characters were not very likeable, but who says you have to like the characters.  I mean. I Hated Nicole, thought HE was a wimp and Ayanna was evil.  But as I read I changed my mind about He and Ayanna, but still despised Nicole.  Having a chance to meet and talk with Eric on his book tour I have even more appreciation for this book.  Don't let the subject matter scare you away.  This is the book to read!	2001-07-14

She invented 2 men in her life, totally different and imagined life with them.  The good man James and the bad boy Michael.

It took long time to read, so I can't say it was a quick easy read.  It was interesting.  I am not sure why it was written in journal form from 5 different people.  THey did not really add or take away from what the story was.  It just took longer to get to the story, like why was JM and her father so estranged?  Who plagurized her story The Moroccan Rose and had it printed in the magazine?  Why did she react the way she did when she saw the story?

I thought I was just being critical when I read it, but I found out members of the bookclub had many of my same thoughts.  I wonder if this was personal, from things I heard about the author. I felt as though being single was one of the worse things that one could be.  I found the assumption that all we want to do is trap or have sex with the pastor, deacons or bishop very disheartening.  Some of the statements made in the book were so off the wall, I just wondered if they were made because it was something that happened in the author's life personally.  If so, then they should not have been made as general statements.  Yes, there were some parts that I could relate to in the book.  The book made for a good discussion hence the 3 stars.	2000-10-24

She tells of a story of a relationship that is ruined by a  manipulative woman and in my opinion a weak man.  A man who only seemed to  think with one head.  The sex scenes while hot only enhanced the story of  Jada, Wellington and Melaine.  Though I am not much on poetry, I like the  poem in the end and I loved how the author used poetry for the sermons.  Jada's mother and her man Robert were a delight.  (Loved when she answered  the door in the bustier.)  Jada's letter to Wellington just summed it all  up.  This was an excellent novel and I look forward to the sequel.	2000-08-31

Yes,  women get in bad relationships and stay to long.  That's a given.  THey  sometimes meet a Mr Right and get on with a wonderful life.  That's good.  But Angela and Steven's story was so boring, so mudane and so not there.  HIs ex-wife was hardly mentioned and there was no comparsion between the  two.  Scenes were overly described and most unnecessary.  THe cover says  the book is happy, sad, humorous and witty and climaxes in an unexpected  ending.  I found none of these traits.  I can sum it up in one word Boring.	2000-08-28

A sister/friend book and a romance book and a book  about love.  Each facet intertwined to make a fascinating story.  Sandy and  Adrian set the example of &quot;for better or worse&quot;  &quot;in  sickness and in health&quot;. The girlfriends were a crucial part of the  mix.  So many time relationship books forget that we have many dimensions  in our lives and friendships with the girls is just as important.  Brittany, Martha and Janice's stories were just as exciting as Sandy's.I  have read 3 of Ms Johnson- Hodges's books and her descriptive writing makes  you feel like a part of the story.

This book will keep you intrigued.	1999-11-29
