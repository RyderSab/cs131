Each chapter is filled with hadith and Quran that we all have read but never took time to apply with those we love.  The advice in this book is clearly the truth, and it will save all of us a lot of time if we understand the content before we get married, or even consider marriage.  <br />This book opens the door to communication to those who are married and who find themselves &quot;trapped&quot; or making the wrong desisions over and over, this book puts a halt to waswisa, and bad communication skills learned throughout the years.<br />This book is even better for those who are thinking of getting married, but who are not quite sure who to marry, or who to look for!

We have teachers who are under qualified, P.E teachers teaching English ect. ect, but overall this book opens the door to a new approach to what happend to the childrens reading style.<br />The main arguements of the book are the way blends are connected, how words are  incorrectly phonetically sounded out, the problems teachers make in teaching phonics in relation to rules, exceptions and sounds, and most importantly, how parents don't catch reading behavior or lack of it.<br />Sight and see, is tackled.  With concept that was taken from, &quot;Why Johnny Can't Read: and what you can do about it&quot; (humm, I wonder where he got this title)... this book offers post arguments on the issue of let's look at a picture book and you can guess at what the words say.<br />It is an interesting read, but it still leaves you a bit thirsty..for an overall approach I liked it because of the less technical, and boring senerios of lab work, I wish more real life senerios took place.<br />Don't buy &quot;Hooked on Phonics&quot; yet, there is hope :-)...just homeschool your children, and learn to read proper phonics preperation books..	2000-12-19

Each Section offers information from the so called rationalists of evolution, the theories, the flukes, the problems with this theory, and of course, the reasons why it is taught as a fact.<br />The rest of the book gives detailed account to the opposite side to evolution with remarkable footnotes, and daleel.

Therefore, his society may  have been to one extreme of leaving Sharia. and this book is from another  extreme implementing Sharia to the upmost respect.	2000-08-27

Unfortunatly, much is lost, forgotten, or unknown about this (words can  not describe her!) angelic woman.  She is the woman who men make dua' to  marry, the presence women would pray to be surrounded by, and the ruh  (soul) many of us beg Allah to have.<br />She is by her name Rabia'.  This  book gives insight to the much forgotten and unknown woman.  Her childhood,  her travels, and  her spiritual accent.  She to me is the ibn alArabi of  female devotees.<br />The book gives us a biography of her life and her  experiences, but it is difficult to know if it is correct or not,  considering the author admits to the false claims of her life that have  been recorded.  Perhaps she is better to be in the hearts of  those who  actually knew her, or who make dua' for her. It would  be a pitty to know  so much about her, and yet not follow her example.  She was never satisfied  with her worship, or tauba, and this book explains storys that carry on the  tales of Rabia.  May Allah bless her, and be pleased with her!	2000-08-12

The life of him,  and the basic orginization of his text Dhikr an niswa al muta 'abbidat as  sufiyyat.  The introduction is very useful to those who read english  translated Sufi texts, because you must be trained formally and spiritually  how to read a Sufi book. Why? Just because the book is old, translated into  English and available does not make it a good rendering to the actual work  itself.<br />Regarding thr format of the book, it is in a biogrophy style,  with the Arabic text facing the English.  The name of the women, her Kunya,  or her name she was known by.  Then the narration begins with the Isnad of  how As-Sulami heard of the particular woman.<br />You are left with nothing  but awe, love and want of the divine and at least left begging Allah for  their qualities.  these women were true devotees, they spent their time  working hard for their akhira, and taking little from the dunya.

If you are a poetry lover I would get the  book anyway, where else can you get a text with Andalusian poets in  English.  I would definately recommend WISODOMS OF ISLAM if you would like  a wonderful book in content, spiritual odes, and real love! For Allah that  is!	2000-08-10
US	48964316	R3DNGYTXH3O7FZ	0946621500	728093618	A Sufi Saint of the Twentieth Century: Shaikh Ahmad al-Alawi (Golden Palm Series)	Books	3	8	26	N	N	not bad...	I give it the stars, only because it is the only English translation of  the great Shaykh Al Alawi.  The BIGGEST mistake of the book, and why oh why  did they get away with it was when the story goes how Al Alawi was given  the tariq.  pg 68 says that he received the tariq in a dream. This is  incorrect, and if it wasn't for that I would have given this book more  stars! All in all, it was a nice read, there is a photo of him Rahimullah,  Is it really him though?? Although it is a biography, at the end there are  some of his wonderful poetry, and Mystical sayings to his murid's! That was  the highlight of the book, oh and some nice brush ups on Islamic history of  that time in the Maghrib area!	2000-08-10

The Arabic is not translated correctly, the Hizbs and the prayers of Abdul Hasan AlShadhili  are incorrect, if you want to know more about the tariq that still exsists  today, I suggest pray to Allah that He sends you a Shaykh, and steer clear  away from this waist of time and money.	2000-08-10

This book is too expensive, but if you can find it at a lesser price, get the book.  Although it is in question as to if this is REALLY an Ibn  Ata'ullah text, the teacher who I studied this book did not say it was not,  as well, he had the original in Arabic..hummm...<br />certainly, this text is  beautiful, easy to read. Although it is not your normal sufi text.  This  book offers solutions to your problems with prayer, worshiping Allah, and  remembrance of Him.  Have a problem with wondering off in wherever land  when you pray?  Wonder why when you make remembrance of Him (dhikr) your  heart does not &quot;feel&quot; like it is there? <br />This book offers many  great antedotes to common problems why we face these delemas in our  worship-they have become only for show. and not sincere!  This book is for  those who need some direction into how to worship Allah, help your heart,  and soften it! Salafi's I highly recommend it because have you ever  wondered why you condem every Muslim who wants to Worship Allah as though  you see him?  This texts will open new doors to softening the hearts of the  dryest person!	2000-08-10
