It takes a bit of time to get used to its sometimes wooden prose (due to the translators trying to keep close to the original languages) but the effort is worth it and will reward you with a greater understanding of the bible than the interpretive NIV can give. This is a neat compact bible with snap closure. The font is very readable. I do wish that there were center references but that would make the book too large for a compact. For twenty bucks, this is a great deal.	2005-07-28

Many sci fi writers get lost in an autistic love of gadgets for their own sake. Gibson does not do that. This novel takes place in a world full of high tech but populated by recognizable human beings. This novel entranced me on many levels: the high quality of the writing, the plot, the ideas and commentary on the current world, the lead character's troubles. I was so excited by this novel that I will be exploring Gibson's other books.	2005-06-25

This is nothing more than an adequately written soap opera of a love triangle that ends in tragedy. I expected great writing; I found the author's writing to be merely adequate and the characters to be wooden. The story is of the lowest common denominator type: a sleazy romance that would have been equally at home in the Harlequin Romance series. The supposedly brilliant portrayal of the Jazz Age was anything but. I am a big twenties fan and know a good deal about the period and Fitzgerald certainly did not capture the feeling of the period for me. The twenties were about Jazz in New Orleans and Chicago, movies in Hollywood, hustle and bustle in Manhattan, not about some spoiled and bored people in Long Island who don't know what to do with themselves (how could anyone have been bored in the 1920's ???!!! There was a good reason why they called it the Jazz Age; it was exciting - to everyone but the clueless numbskulls in this novel). Daisy is supposedly irresistable; she comes across as the twenties version of a valley girl. Any grown man moronic enough to fall for her deserves what he gets. Gatsby is as wooden as any toy soldier.<br />Why, oh why, do academics go crazy over these novels? I think it is because they spend so much time in academia that they have no sense of life outside of universities. I bet there really are professors out there who think that this is a daring, explosive novel. The rest of us, living less rarified lives, respond with a big yawn.	2005-06-23

What this actually is is a tepid rehash of other Hillary books. She likes power. She wants to be president. Her respect for the truth is shaky. She looks the other way when it comes to Bill's adultery. She started out as a radical liberal and is moving to the center for political reasons. She has had rumors dog her that she may be gay. Nothing new here. And that is the gist of the book. No bombshells. No new revelations. Since I already thought that Hillary was a values empty yuppie who lusted to be president at any cost, this book did not offer me anything new. I feel that I fell for the hype when I preordered this with overnight shipping. I think I wasted my money.	2005-06-22

His cause has been taken up by the Eastern literary establishment (New Yorker, Esquire, etc.), so I guess we are stuck with him forever. His humor is based on his willingness to reveal himself as selfish, self-absorbed, shallow, lacking in any human decency. We laugh at his chutzpah. He visits the Ann Frank museum and lusts to turn it into a an apartment for himself, completely dismissing its historical importance to so many (who cares about Ann Frank when he could turn it into a townhouse that would make his friends jealous?). A wealthy, elderly aunt is written about as being nothing more than a grotesque but potentially important source of $$$. This is funny stuff - in small doses. But there is a Howard Stern-like creepiness to the guy. He has a compulsion (that is so intense that it makes him sweat) to touch the heads of strangers - even small boys. He seems to think that his shallowness and selfishness are forgiveable because he admits to them (in other words, \\"the only sins not forgiven are those that are hidden\\" - the rationale of trash tv talk shows). He has an unwholesome and manipulative friendship with a lonely young girl. I began to wonder: what if he really IS as materialistic, self-centered, creepy, and vulgar as he makes out? I suspect that this might be true. In that case, Sedaris isn't so much a funny send-up as he is a pathetic, stunted person.	2005-05-31

The answer is simple: poetry has become indecipherable, incomprehensible, and an academic exercise rather than an enjoyable one. The joke has been that the only people reading poetry anymore are poets who read each other's poems out of social obligation (\\"I'll read yours if you read mine\\"). Everyone else has pretty much given up on it. A lot of poetry is also, transparently, the scribblings of manic-depressives and individuals who have way too much time on their hands and who spend way too much of that time brooding rather than doing. There are too many poems out there that make strained similes and laughably absurd metaphors (\\"My lover's lips are like the first Model T Ford to roll off the assembly line...\\") There are also way too many poems that are what I call \\"Oprah poems\\". \\"Oprah poems\\" are poems, usually written by women, that consist of little more than a long cry (or angry, poisonous rant) over a relationship that has ended. In other words, chick lit for women in therapy. Get over it, sister. I would rather see someone dancing wildly and drunkenly on a dance floor to \\"I will survive\\" than to have to read one of those self-pitying epics in bathos - and that isn't saying much. Then there are the sweaty poems written by self-consciously libidinous males (usually, randy young academics) that are nothing more than tedious, thesaurus generated pornography by self-absorbed boy-men who must think that they are the only men alive in the universe with a sex drive. Otherwise, why would they think their experience was so novel that they were driven to write about it and publish it? Get over it, buddy; find some male friends, buy them a few drinks, and you might learn a few things. <br />Here is a volume that tries very hard to avoid all those faults. It succeeds - most of the time. I enjoyed 70% of these poems. They were refreshing, fun, funny, novel, inventive, a pleasure. Amazing! Poetry that can be enjoyed without codebreaker software to decipher and understand. Poetry that isn't embarassing for a man to read. There were still a good number that left me wondering what in the world they were trying to say. Is it too much to ask poets not to drift so far away from common sentence construction that the reader is bewildered? I couldn't get past the first sentences of a few of these - those old sins and faults of bad poetry still managed to sneak in on a number of these selections. But there were plenty here that surprised and delighted me. I am now going out to get the first volume.	2005-05-23

Really, I had no interest in reading one more book about the holocaust or those who died or escaped from it. Since far worse mass murders took place in the U.S.S.R. and China (and which no one ever writes about or even addresses), I feel manipulated by these books (as I am only allowed to have one response to them - silent reverence). I also find them repetitious and predictable. Where was the humor that the blurbs praised? The first fifty pages are all gloom and doom and take place in Prague as the Nazis close in! The writing was merely servicable - not the brilliant prose critics supposedly found. I have a fifty page rule with fiction - you grab my interest in the first fifty pages (usually 1/6 of the book's text) or you lose me forever. Chabon lost me forever. I pick up a novel in order to escape into a world more interesting, more entertaining, more colorfully painted than my own. If a book is so boring that taking the garbage out seems like a more pleasurable activity than reading, it is time to drop the book and flee.	2005-05-20

The ELCA no longer accepts the inerrrancy of the bible; no longer considers the Lutheran confessions to be authoritative interpretations of scripture; no longer believes, teaches, or confesses that sex is intended by God to be limited to married men and women. By every definition of lutheranism, it is no longer Lutheran. Like the Episcopal Church USA, they have decided to perform actions that have made them into a schismatic group. The sleepy laity has little idea what is going on while the gay lobby does everything in its power to junk reformation theology in order to excuse their lifestyles. Wise lay people will leave the ELCA for a confessional Lutheran church - or else watch the ELCA become fully schismatic, then a scandal, and finally, a pagan religious group with christian cultural overtones and symbolism.	2005-03-06

Walther seems to have drunk deeply from the well of Luther's writings; his mind appears to be so at one with Luther's that this book is of the highest quality and one of the handful of books that would be essential to a scholar after the Bible, the Book of Concord, and Luther's writings.

Ray Bradbury, Jean Shepherd, Edgar Guest, James Thurber, and many others praised them to the skies (or \\"to the collective snoots of a mountain climbing expedition\\" as young Rush Gook might put it). Vic and Sade was a 12 minute daily radio show that was broadcast for over a decade in the 1930's and 40's. It was 3 parts Mark Twain, 2 parts Green Acres, and 6 parts uniquely and bizarrely its own weird, wonderful sense of humor. This is very giddy, very witty stuff. When I discovered the remaining 300 shows (over a thousand shows were destroyed to save on storage space - a crime to shed tears over), I couldn't believe how hilarious, creative, zany, and breathlessly well-written these shows were. They were written 70 years ago but are so brilliantly funny and odd that I felt as if I had discovered a gold mine of humor. Surely, I thought, all of the shows can't be this good??? Yes, they are! It is difficult to explain the show in a few paragraphs. Vic is the father and a devotee of the \\"Kitchenware Dealers Quarterly.\\" He has a colorful way with words and an amazing way of expressing his impatience or fondness with others. Sade is the mother and makes such puzzling dishes as \\"beef punkles (in season)\\" and is a member of the ladies thimble society. Young Rush is the son and is a big fan of such films as \\"You would make a most handsome husband, Chief Petty Officer Griswold\\" which always seem to star the same two actors and plays over at the local bi-joe (bijou). Rush never shuts up, meets the most amazing eccentrics, has odd insights into the world. It needs to be heard to be appreciated. Each line of dialogue contains amazing turns of phrase, witty flashes, and hilarious jokes. Be sure to get this old time radio series on one of th eonline auction houses. You can get many hours of the shows in mp3 format for a few bucks. Then, when you have heard them all, you will be hungry for some of the scripts that remain of the lost shows. Excellent!

You can now buy hundreds of shows for a few bucks and load them onto your ipod in seconds. OTR is a great entertainment hobby. Shows such as Jack Benny, Life of Riley, Our Miss Brooks, Phil Harris, Vic and Sade, and Fibber McGee are still very funny. Shows such as Johnny Dollar, Suspense, and Escape are still intriguing. OTR is perfect for anyone tired of the sex drenched, toilet humor of much of what comes out of Hollywood and cable today. Frankly, I hardly turn on my tv anymore - and I have no cable or satellite bills to pay.  <br />Sooner or later, every OTR fan is going to want to have this book.

As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.  <br />In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentenceimplies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses.	2004-12-30

You get every cartoon published in the New Yorker since the first isssue. That is more than 60,000 cartoons - in book form and on a Windows/Mac compatible CD (the cartoons are in PDF format. Resolution may not always be that great but each one was viewable and readable to this reviewer). Problem is, these are New Yorker style humor cartoons. I found myself zipping from cartoon to cartoon trying to find funny ones. Plenty of mild observations and one liners that wouldn't exactly bring a party to its knees with laughter. Plenty of rich/poor jokes. Plenty of upper class \\"problems\\". Plenty of fashion/style complaints. Very, very few laughs. You have to wonder if the editors actually thought these were funny or if they only thought that they would flatter the mindset of the demographic that they hoped would subscribe to the New Yorker because they thought they wanted to be the type who subscribed to the New Yorker. I think the latter.  <br />Here, in Florida, I met a writer for the NY who was vacationing. He was one of their latest young finds and had sold several stories to the New Yorker. He was drinking very heavily around the pool one day. I asked him - rudely, I admit - if he was the type who filled that magazine with stories about the \\"depressed, self-absorbed rich kids of wealthy, priviledged, and shallow Manhattanites\\". Without any hesitation, he replied, \\"Of course, I do. That's the kind of S--- that they want! That's right up their alley!\\" <br />I can just imagine some cartoonist carefully following the NY cartoon formula in order to sell his cartoons to them.

The result was that the OT passages seemed to have been misunderstood by the NT authors. The result is a profound attack on the inerrancy of the Bible and the inspiration of the NT authors. It was no surprise the the NRSV was adopted widely by Episcopalians - a church in deep trouble. <br />The ESV aimed to remain in the poetic tradition of great English translations while maintaining orthodoxy. The result is a grand rendering of the texts. While the NASB and Christian Srandard bibles are also very accurate, they do not lend well to memorization or public reading.

This makes it ideal for those who are familiar with the scriptures and do not need (or want) anything that is a paraphrase or an interpretation of the translator.

This translation was done with painstaking care. There is no need to learn Greek or Hebrew with the NASB available. Unfortunately, this also means that the NASB doesn't always read like natural, everyday American English. The editors chose accuracy over elegance and smoothness. For students, accuracy is more important. For devotions and newbies, style might be more important. <br />This is a beautiful edition. The binding is solid and tight. This feels very sturdy and will last a lifetime. The font is very clear and readable. Double columns make this look like a traditional New Testament. There are 26 pages of helps in the back.

Each bible contains the excellent (because it is very accurate and highly readable) Holman's Christian Standard translation. Special helps, prayers,  and encouragements for policemen, firemen, and armed forces personnel are contained in each bible. The insignia or symbol of each occupation is nicely printed on the cover. It is sad that due to another religion (guess which one?) we now have a large market for bibles for the swelling ranks of the armed forces fighting the cruel and barbaric methods of those dedicated to violence in the name of their god.

This is exactly what the authors of this book do - without giving any alternative research or evidence to support their stand. In other words, if you don't like a fact, you think you are free to reject it - without any reason to offer except that you don't want to hear about it. This isn't thinking; it's emoting. If this is the low level that your intellect operates on, you need to go back to the middle ages and enjoy witchcraft, astrology, and the flat earth. The rest of us prefer to come to conclusions based on evidence - not your personal superstitions, emotionally charged prejudices, or ideas that you gleaned from watching daytime talk shows. <br />The evidence is there whether you like it or not. Ignore it at your own peril. If you don't agree with it, come up with evidence that supports your view or get out of the way. <br />African-American children score 16 points lower on every IQ test devised. And no, the tests are not culturally biased. The American Psychiatric Association already ruled that out after an exhaustive study. And some tests don't have ANY cultural referents. Example: One IQ test requires nothing but the pushing of buttons when a light comes on. How is that culturally biased?<br />There are plenty of black athletes and entertainment performers but where are the chemists? The physicists? The Nobel Prize in science winners? Why are African nations an economic and social disaster? Why wasn't the compass, the wheel, or written language in use in Africa even in the 1600's?<br />Facts are facts and the current widespread dismal educational non-achievement of African-Americans continues to be a clear sign that more is at work here than the supposed effects of slavery. Even at an all African-American university such as Howard University, the drop out rate is close to 50%. And Howard is not considered a difficult school.   Are we going to base our public discussions on verifiable facts or ideology?   <br />When the church forced Galileo to recant, he signed the papers and then said, &quot;but the earth still revolves around the sun,&quot; - meaning: no amount of political nonsense/bullying is going to change the facts.	2004-07-14

They can only drive in reverse.<BR>I was assigned this book in class and it gave me a lot of insight into the moldy mind of my professor.  I am 21. She is 58.

I mean women under the age of 35, not the old bags who run women's studies departments. Of course not!! If they did, every one of their assumptions would be destroyed.

Think again. It turns out that the greatest scientific genius in history was a twisted, tortured mystic with homosexual tendencies, an ability to hold grudges for decades, an egomaniac, and a very petty man. The word \\"queen\\" (...) comes to mind. He spent a few years on his great mathematical and physics work. He spent decades and decades attempting to decipher alchemy and the Old Testament prophecies. He predicted the year that Chist would return to earth (1948). He thought the design of Solomon's temple was a code for all of recorded history. He wasted year after year on absurd alchemical experiments. He subscribed to the heresy of Arianism. He was deeply religious (and not at all secular) in his outlook (though not in his behavior). He was incapable of much human affection having been damaged by his upbringing. He went nuts several times. He sought revenge on his (perceived) enemies and did so with a tenacity and a ferocity that bordered on being satanic. This is an individual who would have been very comfortable as a guest on Art Bell's \\"Coast to Coast\\" program along with alien abduction \\"experts\\" and conspiracy theorists. He was brilliant and his mathematical work is still astounding. But forget the idea that he was some symbol of the new man of the enlightenment. He was nothing of the sort. A heck of a good read.	2004-05-10

That may prejudice me in my review but I am widely read and can spot a good book when I read one. I haven't enjoyed a novel this much since &quot;The Corrections.&quot; These two novels couldn't be more unlike, however. Empire Falls deals with simple, working class stiffs who have modest intellectual and financial resources. &quot;The Corrections&quot; deals with sophisticated twenty/thirty-somethings and is sure to appeal to the phony NPR/Starbuck's crowd. &quot;The Corrections&quot; is written with a very weary eye and spirit. &quot;Empire Falls&quot; is written with an open heart and some openness about matters of faith. Franzen confirms my cynicism. Russo seems to be saying, &quot;Hey, pal, give us all a chance again.&quot; It is so refreshing to read a male writer who can hold my interest with a book as good as &quot;Empire Falls.&quot;	2004-04-19

He is the wrong person to do it as he has a checkered history when it comes to keeping to the facts. As Oxford academician Richard Dawkins says (see Bryson, &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot;, pp. 330-332) &quot;If only Stephen Gould could think as clearly as he writes!&quot; Dawkins accused Gould of misrepresenting facts in one of his previous books. Gould's conclusions in &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; were further attacked by Dawkins as &quot;mistaken or carelessly inflated.&quot; Reading Gould's hysterical attack on &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; is enlightening for only one reason: it shows how irrational people can become when science removes the foundation for their political beliefs. It is all right for Gould to make a career out of skewering fundamentalists for their belief in creationism (and he is right to do so) but it looks as if Gould can't handle the evidence when one of his own beliefs (in the doctrine of equal ability and intelligence) is shown to be groundless. Rather than admit the truth (as many scientists quietly do so), Gould goes to outrageous ends to try to attack the ideas that intelligence can be measured or that I.Q. is a valid concept.<br />This book is popular because Gould writes well. It is nonsense because Gould is no longer writing science; he is writing devotional tracts for what's left of the old lefties in academia.	2004-03-05

That is their failure. Every study shows that intelligence is unevenly distributed among ethnic groups (see Phillippe-Rushton, Murray and Hernstein, etc.). Rather than offer an argument why they disagree with the evidence (there is none), they just dismiss reality - and science- with a wave of their politically correct hands. They announce that they won't even entertain the idea that mental ability is not equal - without giving a rational reason why they can support this move and still consider themselves intelligent people rather than devotees of a baseless ideology.<br />Having eliminated the most important reason for academic failure, they don't have much left to do but what they do, they do well. They demolish arguments that students would do better if they had more minority teachers, more programs financed by the govt. (Head Start has drained billions from taxpayers and accomplished nothing for that money), more integration. They destroy arguments that gifted programs should be eliminated so that poor performing students can be in classrooms with the brightest (while slowing down the progress of the gifted with classrooms weighed down by dumb students). What they conclude is that African-American students watch an incredible amount of T.V. (much more T.V. than white or Asian students) and that these same students - here it comes- simply do not work as hard as white or Asian students. They advise schools to stop making excuses for laziness, sociopathic misbehavior, and the lack of academic ambition. They advise African-American families to stop making excuses for their children underperforming, misbehaving, and for disrupting classrooms. They advise the teacher unions to get out of the way of progress. <br />All of this is good advice and I am all for it. The question remains: are these students underperforming and misbehaving because of an African-American family culture that doesn't demand (as Asian families do) high achievement or is the underperforming due to lack of ability (I.Q.)? I believe it is the latter - but I am willing to go along with the authors and let them (or anyone else) try to prove me wrong. How you change an entire subculture to value educational achievement and basic good behavior is a mystery. <br />I work in a largely minority high school where most students graduate with the equivalent of an 6th grade education. We have great teachers but the students refuse to do homework, study, or even do any leisure time reading (that would interfere with T.V.) and if we failed every student that deserved it we would have a race war here. Parents are only interested in the school when they smell the possibility of a lawsuit. The result of this automatic promotion of functionally illiterate people is that local businesses no longer value a diploma from our school. We lowered the bar so much that we are graduating students who can't count change so they can't even work in the fast food industry. They can barely read (at age 18) so they need to have their driver's license exam read to them by county workers.<br />Out of 80 IEP meetings last year, I had only two parents show up - dismal evidence of parental indifference toward education (and we are willing to schedule IEP meetings at almost any time so work conflicts are not the reason (actually, most of the parents don't work - as proven by phone calls home during the day). <BR>This book gives as much truth as the liberal educators can deal with. Maybe one day we will deal with the rest of the truth - how intelligence is unevenly distributed across groups and nations. Until then, the comedy goes on.	2004-02-27

His argument is full of great examples and it has probably inspired more people to become naturalists than any other book in history. Jones has tried to update that great book. He fails for a number of reasons. He tends to ramble and never quite gets to his point in a direct way. I wondered several times where he was going. Where Darwin is fascinating and can make you taste his enthusiasm for many of the oddities of nature, Jones can be boring at times. At other times, he can be offensive. I should warn the reader that the book opens with a chapter on AIDS and the homosexual community. Some of Jones' remarks are insensitive. An objective writer could use the AIDS epidemic as an example of evolution at work and do it well. Jones' seems to be grinding a homophobic axe and the grinding got on my nerves. His other book, \\"Y\\" (on maleness - Y is the chromosome that makes men men) shows a similar axe grinding on the subject. This is not what I want in a science book. If I wanted that, I would find an evangelical tract.<BR>I suggest that you get the original by Darwin.

A few pages of what actually goes on in our neurobiologies when we fall for someone would have disillusioned much more than a cynical survey of the results of those neurochemicals firing. Think how Darwin destroyed religious superstition with his research. Instead, Kipnis shows how silly people act and how silly people think who criticize how people act when under the influence of romantic/erotic love.<br />Love is literally dopey (due to the brain's dopamine). People who waste years of their life looking for love are morons. And Kipnis missed an opportunity to tell it like it is to her mostly female readership.	2004-02-13

Approximately 100,000 years ago peoples left the hot climate of Africa for the colder and challenging climates of Europe and Asia. The result is that natural selection chose larger brains, lower aggression, lower reproductive rates, and more intense parental care of the young in Europe and Asia. In Africa, the reproductive strategy was to produce more children. This state of affairs explains why African tribes still had not invented the wheel, compass, written languages even into the 1800s. It also explains why African nations remain a disaster of disease, crime, corruption, weak infrastructures and vast academic and scientific failure/nonachievement. In order for a society to be technologically advanced you need a critical mass (At least 10%) of people with IQs over 120 (the lowest IQ expected of CEOs and scientists). This is lacking in Africa.<br />A good theory will explain all the known facts and Rushton has accumulated plenty of them. Page after page of research builds his case to the inevitable conclusion. People of African descent are in a desperate situation. And the liberal idea that \\"all men are created equal\\" is nothing but a fantasy. It is clear that  Orientals have the greatest intelligence and that Caucasians follow closely. IQs below 90 are insufficient to keep up with the demands of the information age. And you can only blame nature and not the schools, society, slavery, etc.  Even if we had perfect schools the result would be the same.	2004-02-11

Gould is so anxious and paranoid about where this admission might lead that he denies its possibility right from the start before looking at the evidence - hardly a good way to do science but a great way to keep politically correct. This is a sad, pathetic book from a once great science writer. It looks like Gould would rather maintain his beliefs rather than look at the evidence - the very thing Gould has accused creationists of doing in his previous books. Interestingly, Gould attacks the authors of \\"The Bell Curve\\" for the conservative leanings that appear in that book. He suggests that their politics influenced their reading of the data. But this is exactly what Gould has done in his own book! In Gould's case it is his far left politics that have clouded his reading of the data. Very sad. Some readers will buy this book based on Gould's excellent reputation. In this case, Gould was living off his reputation rather than furthering it.	2004-02-08

No one talks like that. No one thinks like that. And no one writes like that except for pretentious authors beloved by academics who have no idea what interests people outside of moldy ivory towers. Virginia Woolf committed suicide. All the more reason to avoid this book lest the contagion of her world view infect your mind and depress you. This is a dated, pretentious, dry, irrelevant novel. I am asuming that it is being pushed because it is poilitically correct to have at least one female author in the great books list. Unfortunately, this is a dead author whose works should have been allowed to die with her rather than be immortalized. In fact, while Woolf was contemplating suicide, she should have destroyed her work along with her life in a big bonfire. That would have spared us this novel that I wasted money on.	2004-02-03

So why invest your entire life in an institution with the same failure rate?). 2) Marriages that survive make the participants only 1% happier (after the first two years)than those who never marry. 3) Marriages that survive and are \\"happy\\" are actually \\"parallel marriages\\" where the individuals may live together but actually have separate, parallel lives and interests - they are more like friends and roomates rather than the romantically unrealistic situations pictured in movies and books. 4) Study after study confirms the fact that the happiest men and women are those with careers, hobbies, and activities that are personally intriguing and absorbing. If you are super intelligent, marriage will become boring very quickly. If you are lacking in intelligence, you will drive your husband crazy seeking emotional fulfillment to complete your life that no human being could possibly give you on a sustained basis. 5) Romantic feelings are temporary chemical states which could be compared to hallucinatory/subjective distortions of reality and the actual value of an individual. The body chemical oxytocin makes you fall in love and when it peters out (usually after 6 months to three years), your eye starts to stray in the attempt to get that high again. Because the chemical has worn off, you no longer think Mr. Wonderful is so wonderful. What a letdown when we come out of the daze and see how average our mates really are. We fall in love with people we think are extraordinary. In truth, most men and woman are very ordinary and average. Only temporary insanity brought on by hormones makes us think otherwise. If you really want to be happy live a life full of activity, and enough hard work to make you enjoyand appreciate the times of leisure. Too much work or the wrong kind of work will kill you. Too much leisure will bore you. Find the balance. This book teaches you how to get married. The bigger question is why you should bother.	2004-01-24

Some will have you believe it is a metaphor for the clashing of European and American cultures. That is utter nonsense. Much of this is a bit too real to be mere literary invention. The fact that Nabokov wrote another novel, \\"The Enchanter,\\" on the same subject, suggests that this is auto-porn and has no other purpose than tittilation - of the author and anyone else who is a slave to this fetish.

This does not fill the bill, however. The editors simply took the NIV study bible and added a few hundred study notes (to the 20,000) already there. The end result is unsatisfactory. Many of the notes do not follow Lutheran theology and do not accept the inerrancy of the bible as the Missouri Synod does (the only Lutheran church that matters - the others are either small or allow homosexuality and women pastors). If you want a bible that truly is a new product and follows reformed theology (albeit with a strong Calvinist bent), get the Spirit of the Reformation study Bible. This is simply the NIV study bible with a few addends.	2003-11-14

It is a disgusting and typically american approach. Problems about feminism, sexuality, theology, are all brushed aside. Sermons become dumbed down feel good talks.

The Greek word for brothers is translated into &quot;brothers and sisters.&quot; This may please some feminist atheists but it is no longer a translation - it's a complete re-write. Maybe Paul meant &quot;brothers and sisters&quot; but we have no way of knowing so it is not our place to put words into his mouth. Sure, the gospel is meant for all, male and female, but Paul did not address his letters directly to all. Indirectly, the message is to all but Paul did not write them that way so neither should the TNIV. This is the equivalent of writing a letter to your sister, addressing it as such and then having some editor scratching her name out and putting your brother's name in her place years from now. It is taking liberties with the Word of God and all good Christians should not support this move to drag the church into the hell of politcal correctness, moral relativism, etc.	2003-09-22

Find a copy of \\"Faith Alone\\" if you are looking for something from the great reformer for your spiritual reading. One selection has to do with Luther expelling gas to ward off the devil (this selection has absolutely no point. Luther was from peasant stock and retained his earthiness. Relating such an incident has no purpose in a book meant for spiritual reading). Another has to do with a letter he wrote to a woman who suffered a miscarriage and which has little application to anyone else. I have read a good deal of Luther and I am convinced that the authors don't even like him (they call him an \\"old, hateful man\\" because of a handful of anti-semetic statements that are an anomaly in an otherwise profoundly pastoral life) or understand what his message was. Luther's writings fill over thirty volumes and are a goldmine of inspiration and insight to anyone who takes the trouble to sift through them.

It is easy to see why. Rand love Hollywood movies and she was also a philosopher. As a result, she is one of the very few philosophers who can write fantastically. This is one heck of a page turner. Peopled by two types, action driven doers and parasitical whiners, Atlas Shrugged details a final showdown between the moochers and the producers, the complainers and the thinkers, the doers in life and the observers.  Written during the cold war in 1956, it is stunningly relevant to controversies we are engaged in and battling today such as affirmative action, religious terrorists, moral irresponsibility, etc. You may absolutely despise Rand's heros - they are arrogant, atheistic, self centered, disdainful of the weak and dim-witted - but you will find it difficult to keep from reading to the end.  Rand can write up a storm - her pen blazes on each page because she cared deeply about what she was writing. But don't get the idea that this is some intellectual cold blooded affair - this is one heck of a novel - full of humor, insight, sex, adventure, etc. It is written on an epic scale with an eye for everything that encompassses life. Rand is a controversial figure - even an unlikable one - but I like her book - it is great. If a book is to be judged by its ability to pull you in and give you a great emotional and intellectual ride, then \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" scores big time.	2003-07-19

Many believers in the Koran have criticized this translation as not being the \\"real\\" Koran because they say that it can never be translated accurately. They even suggest that one cannot possibly understand the Koran unless you study Arabic with some scholars. I have news for these people. This is an old superstition about languages which has absolutely no basis in fact. Any linguist will tell you that anything in one language can be translated into another language and that there are no superior languages or more expressive languages. Just as Islam followers would like the whole world to bow facing Mecca in an act of subordination (\\"Islam\\" means submission, not peace, by the way) to one of the most undeveloped and uncivilized areas of the world, so they would love Arabic to be held up as some sort of superior language, the only language that the Koran could rightly be studied in. This is absolute nonsense. Any idea in one language can be translated into any other language. What is really going on here is: 1) a fear that the Koran would actually be submitted to modern critical methods and be found wanting (see any of the books by Ibn Warraq and you will see that there is much about the Koran that scholars find less than divine). This cannot be done in the East where scholars are put to death for investigating the Koran. 2) A fear that the Koran would get away from the iron grip of Islamic fundamentalists and any sort of liberal, moderate interpretation might take place. In the East, the usual punishment for doing so is death again.<br />3) A fear that the believers in the Koran might actually understand its literal message and find it wanting. As is usual in most religions, the average believer knows very little about their own faith. Finding out the truth would cause a crisis of faith. In the Arabic countires, education is in a very poor state. Many people are illiterate. Many women are denied education. The masses rely on the authorities to find out what to believe. Without literacy or democracy or equality of the sexes, you have an ignorant mob that is easy to control. If that mob ever learns to read and think for themselves, the religious leaders could be in big trouble. Keeping the Koran mysterious is to their advantage. This is why they tell people that you need a scholar to understand the Koran or that you can only read it in Arabic and all translations are inadequate.<br />Don't fall for any of this. Dawood does a fine job of translation. It is easy to see exactly what the message of the Koran is. Is the Koran permissive of violence? Yes. Are the stories in the Koran a confused jumble of Old Testament, New Testament, gnostic and pagan stories? Yes.  Read it for yourselves and see. And you don't need an Arabic scholar to read it with to see that.	2003-07-06

This is patent nonsense. Every year, untold numbers of people (students, etc.) are forced to read him by trained teachers and they still end up questioning his value. Let's examine the Shakespeare cult:<br />1) Any author who needs an interpreter, explainer, or support from the educational system to keep readers is simply not a vital author. If Shakespeare was a vital author, people would love him without the brainwashing and spoonfeeding of a vast educational system that insists on teaching these tired plays year after year because everyone has done so year after year.<br />2) Silly romances and boring dramas driven by improbable plots and vulgar jokes are not great literature. These plays are the work of a man who spent far too much time on scandal and trivial junk to be taken seriously.<br />3) The Shakespeare nuts want it both ways and they can't have it either way. On the one hand, they insist that Shakespeare be regarded with the reverence one would give to holy scripture. No one must dare question its greatness, truthfulness, or entertainment value. If you do so, you will be attacked as a philistine. On the other hand, when people believe this nonsense and stay away from Shakespeare because they do not want to be bored, the cultists insist that we are taking it too seriously and that Shakespeare is simply great theatre (when it is nothing of the sort) which can be enjoyed with as much gusto as a rock concert or a stand up comedy act (which is a lie).<br />4) Any book that needs a glossary for the reader in order to be understandable must either be abandoned as dated or translated into modern English. The Shakespeare nuts wouldn't insist that anyone read Beowulf in Old English or argue that its Old English language is so beautiful that we all must learn what is now a foreign language to us but they do this when it comes to Shakespeare. This is beyond irrational. Imagine being forced to read a viking saga in Old Norse with only a glossary to assist you because the professor happens to love the cadences of Old Norse. This is no different from the nuts who do the same with Shakespeare.<br />5)  I judge literature on two, and only two, criterion: Is it intriguing? Is it entertaining? I don't give a fig about some academic telling me I need to read something because it is historically important. I doubt that Shakespeare's audience paid to see his plays because they had historical importance and neither will I. Alas, what was entertaining even twenty years ago seems dated and boring today, nevermind what may have been entertaining hundreds of years ago. Old jokes lose their punch, old romances become foolish and insipid with time, old dramas about historical figures become irrelevant and sleep inducing, old concerns no longer concern us. Shakespeare is dated, unfunny, boring.<br />And no amount of forcing the issue will change that. Free Shakespeare from the support of the educational system and watch him become forgotten as quickly as last years fashions. And I say, \\"good riddance\\" to an author who should have been relegated to the trash heap at least a century ago.viking saga in Old Norse with only a glossary to assist you because the professor happens to love the cadences of Old Norse.

That is the good part of the book. She is somewhat correct in her analysis of why some accents are high status and some are low status.  Mostly, it has something to do with wealth and power. The accents of the wealthy and the powerful are seen as \\"more correct\\" than those of the poor and underpriviledged. This is true to a degree but does not tell the whole story. Accent prestige also comes about when the most educated and highly skilled (M.D.s, etc.)  and not always wealthy or powerful (teachers, writers) speak in certain patterns. In some cases, accent prestige is simply a result of celebrities speaking in certain ways (this can be seen in the adoption by white middle class teenagers of the black dialect of rap stars who are often from backgrounds that can hardly be considered wealthy or powerful. In the last century, the actor David Garrick was also seen as a model of a \\"good\\" accent and set pronunciation standards for many people).  Lippi-Green is a fan of social deconstructionist philosopher Michel Foucault and her analysis adheres to one cliche after another. Her dated victimology lessens the value of what would have been an excellent book. Dividing the world into victims and victimizers is simplistic.  She labels every categorization that people make based on accents to be discrimination when sometimes it is nothing more than a convenient categorization with no social consequences. This process is universal and occurs even in those groups that Lippi-Green believes are being discriminated against because of their accents (ex: African-Americans are known to percieve the use of \\"double negatives\\" (\\"I don't need no food\\") by other African-Americans as a sign of being less educated and proper). I also know from my own inner city students how even the underpriviledged categorize each other according to how \\"ghetto\\" their speech is. Lippi-Green's use of the very tired and cliched language of oppression made my eyes glaze over in several spots.<br />  It is my opinion that most categorization based on accents is neither malevolent nor well-thought out but a result of the brain's natural tendency to seek out patterns in order to comprehend the environment and incoming stimuli. Lippi-Green, by using social deconstructionist models, is almost forced to see intentional oppression and evil intentions where none may exist. People do not always make assumptions about others based on their accents because they are wicked, nasty language nazis intent on keeping people locked into lifetimes of poverty and oppression. Sometimes they make assumptions simply because they are engaged in the natural process of induction based on the available data. I refuse to see a master with a whip in every individual who asks if I am from New York because I drop the occasional \\"r\\" when I speak.<br />  Lippi-Green also takes umbrage at anyone who would dare to suggest that individuals can modify their accents (which they can and do) and that it might be to some individual's advantage to do so (for greater social and economic opportunities). It is. Lippi-Green avoids discussion of the fact that the courts have ruled, time and time again, that discrimination based on accents does NOT violate civil rights laws when the accent is a material obstacle to an individual performing the duties of a job (for example - a receptionist who cannot be understood by callers because of a strong accent, etc.). In such a case, the only way to get ahead would be for the individual to modify their accent. A speech pathologist (I happen to be one) is not a SS storm trooper defending a fascist system, but a trained specialist trying to help an individual learn the verbal skills necessary for employment in a competitive, service oriented economy.  Facts are facts, and no matter how much Lippi-Green reconstructs and deconstructs reality into political fodder, speaking with high intelligibilty is a necessity for much advancement in the economy. This is not some empty promise. It is a fact. To mislead individuals to believe otherwise is performing a grave disservice and derailing them from learning employability skills into the dead end of political resentment.	2003-06-11

If you are looking for a pronunciation dictionary that is current, lists variants, discusses variants that have equal numbers of adherents, makes suggestions for preferred pronunciations, gives data about what percentage of  people prefer such and such a pronunciation, and is attractively printed, do not get this one. This is plainly packaged, has very little explanatory information (Longman's has over 200  charts and many explanatory notes), gives no data as to who prefers what or how many, gives little direction, etc. A dull affair all around. The Longman Pronunciation Dictionary is multicolored, informative, and fascinating to read. When there are dramatic variants, Longman explains the issues clearly. Longman also includes a removable phonetics chart so you do not need to keep flipping to the key in the front of the book.  I am a speech therapist and I find myself going to Longman on a daily basis while the Oxford dictionary sits on the shelf.	2003-03-29

Rand was not original. Every one of her ideas was said by other philosophers many times before. Reading Rand, you realize that she is ignorant about this fact. A few graduate courses in the history of philosophy would have humbled her as all she did was to re-invent the wheel. It must come as a shock to her followers when they read the truly great philosophers and find out that Rand was unoriginal - and a lightweight.<BR>What Rand was, though, was a good writer. Her essays show her ability to make philosophy understandable. She was a lively writer. It is too bad that she couldn't be happy with just being a philosophical popularizer (being to philosophy what Sagan and Asimov were to science).	2003-03-04

This is third generation Chomsky - and when it comes to Chomsky, people usually embrace his theories without any proof. Saying that we are genetically hard wired for speech is no more startling than saying that we are hard wired to walk on two legs rather than on all fours or to grasp objects with the use of opposable thumbs. So what? It is a big jump from there to claiming that we are hard wired for language and that there is a universal grammar that applies to every language. There isn't. For every grammar rule that the Chomsky camp claims is universal, there is an exception. Does the Chomsky camp give up when presented with this evidence? Nope, they change the rules of the game. Of course, you can win if you keep changing the rules, retreat from positions, dismiss (or ignore) the exceptions. Who couldn't? <BR>This book will seem fascinating if you have never had any prior exposure to linguistics. To those of us who have, it is nothing but a tiresome anthology of what has been written in the last 50 years.

He is a radical descriptivist and, like most in that school, derides and dismisses standard American English in favor of supposedly superior dialects. In the typical self-hating liberal caucasian pattern, he starts out by claiming that all languages are equally complex and then goes on to knock his own heritage of Standard American English for its supposed deficiencies and inferiority. He does this while building a successful career as a writer whose mastery of SAE is his only appeal, in my view. What we have here is a man who dismisses SAE standards while writing books that are bestsellers because they are written in an excellent SAE style. Only in academia could we find such nonsense and such self-loathing among educated white men and women. How many books would Pinker sell if he wrote in BAE (black American English)? I doubt that he could express the complex ideas he adheres to in BAE, despite his protests that all languages are equally complex (and if Pinker really thinks that BAE is complex enough to express any thought, I challenge him to explain Chomsky's theories in it). <BR>Pinker spends hundreds of pages trying to convince us that Chomsky is correct. He fails. This book is not a reasoned argument. It is the ravings of a man who throws out whatever examples he can find to support his religious-like adherence to Chomsky - only he doesn't tell you that he ignores all of the examples that argue against his viewpoint. Where is this supposed language device that, so far, only exists as a metaphysical fantasy in Pinker's mind?<BR>Oh yeah, and I am sick of hearing how Chomsky is one of the most quoted intellectuals in the twentieth century. It is dishonest of Pinker to make that statement and not carefully add that Chomsky is usually quoted for his radical, virulently anti-American political writings that have absolutely nothing to do with his linguistic work. The fact is, few people actually read his linguistic work. They are nearly unreadable.<BR>If you read this book, take with a  grain of salt.

If you love words, this book will keep you entertained for weeks with its excellent essays on the histories and controversies surrounding words and the ways that they are used and abused. It is an extraordinary buy at the price being asked for here at Amazon.com. As a grammar guide, however, it is good but not great. Merriam-Webster takes a radically descriptive approach to grammar - if plenty of people use a word or phrase a certain way - Shazam! - M-W declares it standard and acceptable. Forget that the usage may be based on a misuderstanding, a mistake, an ignorant misreading of a word. All that matters to M-W is that the majority should rule. This is allowing the mob to lynch the English language. There are other considerations, M-W. Just because millions of people eat at fast food burger joints does not mean that that is how we all should eat. A usage guide should inform us how the language should be written and spoken at its best and most elegant - not advise us to give up any attempt to do so because so few bother. I prefer Bryan Garner's excellent work as his ground rules for usage avoid the low ground that M-W consistently stoops to. Get this and enjoy it. Just do not use it as your only guide.	2002-12-20

This is the best bio on Dino - the man whose public image was that of a carefree, relaxed, swinging, lovable man's man and ladies man but who, privately, was a misanthrope who gave up on humanity, goals, his craft, and life years before he actually died. Tosches does a great job of research and no completer picture of the Martin and Lewis days is going to be had in the near future. The portrait of Dino - so lazy that he didn't even appear on his own celebrity roasts in the end (they edited in multiple reaction shots), drunk and spaced out on pills, using women like receptacles (women loved him until he bedded them and then they saw how empty he was), a slacker to the thousandth degree, vegging out in front of the tv watching westerns and waiting for death, is a sick one.

His epigrams are often nothing but restatements of the obvious. I never understood what all of the fuss was about but the Nietzsche cult goes on and on. Here is his philosophy in a nutshell:<BR>1) God is no longer the powerful idea that once held sway in the West. Morality needs a new foundation. Yawn.<BR>2) Those who work and struggle to rise above the masses are, well, they rise above the masses and can be called supermen (or overmen). Big deal. Nietzsche can call them that if he wants. So what? <BR>3) Christianity in its purest form makes wimps out of people. Well, a few people do if they become saints.

Paine wrote one of the funniest, liveliest, wittiest volumes on religion there ever was. With a gifted eye for nonsense and logical inconsistency (allow Paine to walk you through the Bible and it will never seem the same to you again. He is able to point out so much that others have missed), Paine uses the scriptures as a basis for what amounts to being one of the funniest monologues ever written. He hammers home his arguments with a razor sharp intellect and a gift for the concise, epigrammatic, hilarious statement.<br />It is too bad that Paine was better at working for others (the early colonies of the USA) than for himself. He died quite poor, almost completely forgotten and neglected, usually drunk, and often in the company of women who were beneath him. His fiery temperament was more suited to conflict and great causes than to retirement. Without a cause, he easily fell into dissolution. As so many other great men discover in their later years, the stimulation of the carnal appetites serve as a poor substitute for the excitements of their younger, more productive days. If it were not for the gift of a farm, he would have starved.<br />The US owes him a great debt as his other writings galvanized the colonies and are pretty much the reason why we are no longer a part of Great Britain.

Why, oh why, do they then believe the same claim when made by some salesman they do not know and never met (Muhammed), who lived hundreds of years ago? It is a fact that it is just as easy to tell a big lie as a small one.<BR>Leaving aside this question why anyone would be so uncritical as to believe that this book was given to a carpet salesman (Muhammed) by an angel when there is no more proof for that assertion than for Joseph Smith's assertion that an angel did the same for him (and history reports at least another half dozen claims by men claiming to receive books from angels. They might just as well have claimed that they received gift fruit baskets instead of books. The absurdity is the same), one would only wonder at a book whose effects upon the ignorant is to lead them to attempt mass murders, destroy democracies, kill innocent lives, stone women and children to death, erase all art and music, rob humanity of the most innocent of joys, and become the biggest threat to peace in the last hundred years if it were not for the fact that the reasons for this are easily found within these pages. One doesn't have to read very far in this volume before noting the profound barbarianism of the author and, by implication, anyone who takes this literally. If this book were to rule the world, the world would become a vast desert devoid of all humanity, freedom, kindness, equality, joy. What would be left would be a horror that would be the dream of those fanatics who hate life and embrace the skeletal arms of death. There are people who want war in the name of this book.

He could only talk about the faith he grew up with but not what the Koran actually said! What he grew up with was fit for the mind of a child.

The attempt to get them will only polarize the races even more so.

A few strain the tacit agreement with the reader because they deliberately set you up to think one way and then pull the rug out from under you as the conclusion goes in a different direction. But this is quibbling. If you are looking for entertainment with a just bit of tweaking of your intellect, the Holmes stories will more than reward your investment!	2002-07-17

The Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus	Books	1	16	55	N	N	Not to be taken seriously	By completely misunderstanding the scriptures (the Gospels were written not merely to record the sayings and deeds of Jesus but to express their experience of Him, their understanding of who He was) and the understanding of the first few centuries of the church (which would never have occurred if they thought he was only a charming social revolutionary {politician} and not a divine figure), this small group of extremists with questionable credentials (one was the scriptwriter for that other great theological work, the sleazy movie \\"Showgirls\\") takes it upon themselves to pare the scriptures down to a bare minimum that eliminates anything divine. I don't have a problem with agnostics and atheists and unitarians using the gospels anyway they want. People have been constructing Jesus in a multitiude of images for centuries. It won't affect my own faith. My disgust with this has to do with their use of the method of a small group of people voting oin what is true and not and then presenting this to the public as if this was a valid method of research or scholarship. Without a single conservative, moderate, or person blessed with faith in the risen Christ in this group, the results were a foregone conclusion. It is like asking a group of Arabs what they think of Israel or asking a panel of NRA members how they feel about gun laws. Duh! <BR>Not to be taken seriously. As the members of this group are just unitarians who don't have the guts to give up their academic jobs (and salaries) in theology departments to pursue a more honest living, you can dismiss these books entirely. As usual, theology departments with tenured professors are so far from the life of faith in their little ivory towers that once in awhile they need to break out and do something provocative just to reassure themselves that their lives of endless drudgery with grad students have some purpose and significance.	2002-07-06

Don't tell US that Islam is peaceful. Start telling your fellow moslems. They are the ones that need convincing. Having read this, it seems to me that the Koran is a very violent and intolerant message. It is also anti-woman, anti-science, anti-gay, anti-jewish/christian, anti-peace.  I can see clearly from reading it how followers could use it as an excuse for war. Don't tell me that Jihad means \\"struggle\\" and not war. I never heard of the word until moslems used it to mean war and NOT struggle. Convert your own people if Islam isn't violent.	2002-07-01

Hasn't he read anything published since he left seminary? He seems totally - and embarassingly - ignorant of the counter-offensive that has occupied philosophers and theologians since the early '80's. Anyone who hasn't read Feyerabend's devastating and brilliant attack on rationalism or hasn't digested the seminal papers on the anthropic principle (that the universal constants are finely tuned in a way that makes life possible and that any variation would have led to a lifeless universe, ergo the universe is designed for life), or hasn't read the extensive literature attacking &quot;bodiless' rationalism and Cartesian dualism, the radical orthodoxy movement, is simply so out of touch with the current debate on God and spirituality that they need to retire from the public forum of ideas as a quaint anachronistic leftover from the 60's. Read Spong if you want to know what philosophers and theologians were thinking -FIFTY YEARS AGO. Waste your money if you want to hear Spong regurgitate Robinson's &quot;Honest to God&quot; book (which was also an uncritical abstract of arguments and ideas of the 50 years previous to ITS publishing) for the hundredth time. Borrow a copy from your local library if you want to study what theology is like under an understanding of physics which is outdated. Read him if you want to look at the faith through eyes so clouded over by an outdated politically correct extremism and feminist deconstructionism that even ivy league literary academia is sick of its cliches and victimology. But DON'T think you are reading anything that is even remotely in touch with the current outlook of the best minds in the field. This stuff is OLD HAT (and invalid). Spong's constant labeling of anyone who disagrees with him as being right wing, unscientific, superstitious, homophobic, anti-woman, etc. is laughable as it only makes him look even more like a fossil/refugee from a '60's seminary. No one talks this way anymore but very elderly academic has-beens. Now that Spong is retired, perhaps he can catch up on his reading. It looks like he hasn't done any in decades.	2002-06-12

THIS, however, is so devoid of any spiritual content that it is absolutely stunning that anyone could declare this to be the word of God - any god! This is a scripture so crass, so vulgar, so lacking in spiritual inspiration that only a threat of decapitation (the preferred method of converting the infidels) could get me to take it seriously. Why is anyone supposed to think that this came from an angel? Did Mohammed perform miracles? No. Did he live an exemplary life that inspires? No (unless you think an adulterous, murderous conqueror is worthy of emulation). Do his followers live such industrious, peaceful, loving lives that one wishes to know their secret? No, a thousand times no. Is the text itself proof of its supposedly divine origin? Far from it - errors and abominations are evident throughout (polygamy, murder of unbelievers, extra taxing of christians, anti-semitism, etc). A faith that \\"converts\\" by giving people a choice of death or conversion hasn't the most basic understanding that religion is in the heart and not on the lips. Look at the countries ruled by Islam and see what life is like. Then, look at those that have gone through the protestant reformation. It is clear that this book is a death sentence for freedom, women's rights, freedom of thought, happiness, freedom of religion, gentle spirituality, science, etc. That is why followers have nothing left to do but blow themselves up. Their countries and culture are dying - left stuck in the middle ages and there is no way out as long as this book is ruling over them. The arab countries must either give up Islam or give up any relevance in the modern world. All that is left them to do is to strike out in a desperate, frustrated, hate filled last stand against modernity before they sink into total irrelevance.	2002-06-10

Any newscaster who makes millions of dollars a year, sends his kids to private school, asscociates with no one but celebrities and the wealthy, has nothing in common with mainstream America. Brokaw, Jennings, and the rest are anachronisms. If you want to find out what the main stories on the evening news will be, all you have to do is look at the New York Times front page that morning, and then call up the most liberal political action groups to get the slant on that days stories. That is all the big three do - regurgitate political correctness. Where is the journalism? How do they justify the big bucks they get paid? All of their sources come from groups like NOW - liberal, non-representative groups with few members. It seems to me that the big three do nothing but broadcast press releases from these groups. Goldberg shows how corrupt the networks are. For example, (a fact I noticed) as soon as a republican president gets into office, stories about homelessness rise in the media. As soon as a democrat gets in, those stories disappear. I remember how the NY Times said homelessness was careening out of control just 12 weeks (!) after Bush got into office. And all of the stories about homeless people featured laid off white collar workers instead of the alcoholics, drug addicts, and insane that make up the majority of the homeless. All of this would be laughable if I took it seriously. I don't. I get my news from other sources and leave these anachronistic liberal rich guys to propagandize a shrinking audience.	2002-06-03

There is a very distasteful concept implicit in this book that states that marriage is perfectly scriptural if a man enters it for no other reason than to find a legitimate sexual outlet. Needing a sexual release is enough reason to marry. That has to be one of the lowest views of marriage I have ever heard. No romance, no idealistic view of the male/female partnership, no desire to raise a family, no sense of offering and receiving love is necessary as long as the man has a sexual outlet. Women become receptacles for the man who is a \\"good Christian man\\" for having sex within marriage. Nevermind what this says about women. If that is the only reason you are getting married, do women a favor and don't bother. We do not need another Russel Yates using his wife until she goes nuts and [hurts] her kids. There is a type of very immature and insensitve Christian male out there who needs to grow up and be a man, rather than some randy adolescent ..who uses the Bible to enslave women.	2002-03-27

I think that Schwartz (not to be confused with Martin Schwartz, the airflow therapist) is wrong on more than a few points. By now, however, I know that no one stuttering book can serve as a primer for therapists. You need to read a great deal, be always willing to individualize your treatment for each client's needs, and be open and flexible rather than committed to any one theory or treatment method. If you are a therapist working with fluency clients, add this to your library. If you are a therapist trying to learn more about fluency, the tape and text can serve as an at-home workshop for you.

The author says much which needed to be said and she does it quite well. Even without ever having joined the church, I could detail a number of very sad and tragic situations that I am aware of where pious followers of the faith have ruined their health/lives by a total reliance on C.S. for healing (one girl was horribly scarred for life because her mother refused to have her vaccinated. She is now grotesquely disfigured). That being said, I still believe that Christian Science has the power to be a force for great good in the world. It is a religion that seeks to heal the world on every level, that is fundamentally optimistic and positive, that presents an overwhelmingly loving view of God, that is idealistic, solution oriented, and gentle and tender.  Here are some of my suggestions for reform, knowing that they will be too much for hard liners and not enough for detractors:<BR>1) &quot;Science and Health&quot; needs either a complete overhaul (editing, rewriting, updating, etc.) or it needs to be junked. MBE was a terrible writer and her textbook needs profound revision. <BR>2) &quot;Absolute&quot; Christian Science needs to be abandoned except under the most necessary circumstances. People should be encouraged to seek out medical care. People should be encouraged to combine medicine and prayer.<BR>3) Christian Scientists need to abandon MBE's many warnings about remaining ignorant about medical knowledge. It is well past time for church members to educuate themselves about medicine and their bodies.<BR>4) The church needs to abandon the church service readings that rely only on the Bible and Science and Health. It is time for real sermons.<BR>5) The church board needs to loosen up their iron grip on the church. More democracy is meeded.<BR>6) The Christian Science Monitor -which still remains one of the best papers in the world - shoudl be used to promote these changes.<BR>That's mytwo cents. You may disagree but it is clear that without SOME change, the church will soon be history.	2002-03-26

It is usually swept under the carpet. The result is that many evangelical churches are in complete denial about how many so-called happy marriages are really on the fritz and how many so-called churchmen are really doing a lot of things which they aren't supposed to be doing. Worse, the churches seem to have little to offer people overcome by sexual temptation except some platitudes and speeches by people who aren't walking the walk themselves. Hypocrisy is rampant. Everyone is keeping up appearances.<BR>That being said, the book is a disappointment. The authors think they can nail the cure down to an eight week program - which is absurd. They also think they can help men stop self-stimulation even if they are unmarried when my knowledge of counseling with many people tells me that, perhaps, .1% (that is one in a thousand) of men can stop doing this if they have no sexual outlet. The rest are just going to drive themselves nutty trying.<BR>This book contains a few good reminders about watching what you dwell on with your eyes - which is old advice from the monks in the past.

This play-among his best (if you can see the movie with Rex Harrison, do not miss it)- has such brilliant dialogue and sparkling humor that it is easy to forget that one is being preached to. Shaw thinks human evil is due to socially deprived environments. Ergo, pour money into poor neighborhoods and social evils will vanish. Unfortunately for Shaw's argument, poverty and human evil are two different things entirely and only intersect occasionally and coincidently. The poor can be poor due to lack of opportunity or due to a culture of self-destructiveness (illegitmacy, drug/alcohol use, disdain for values that lead to achievement, disdain for skills that lead to steady employability). It is difficult to sustain an argument that the poor in the USA are so due to a lack of opportunity when recent immigrants have pretty much taken the available opportunities and ran with them, rapidly entering the middle classes within a generation of arriving here. Shaw simply cannot believe that anyone would choose to remain poor. Well, they can and do, when getting ahead means putting in 40+ hours a week, and not loafing all day on a street corner in an inebriated/stoned condition. Accepting that fact would have saved millions of lives that were sacrificed in the last century in the attempt to build a perfect &quot;worker's paradise&quot;.<BR>Leaving the silly premise behind the play aside, Shaw has crafted a startling piece of theatre and uses his magisterial command of the English language to amuse, provoke, and amaze the audience.	2001-12-18

The book is episodic and the narrative doesn't really move along. While everyone else praises the book for its display of imagination, I didn't find one novel idea or incident in it. The wit was weak, the characters one dimensional, the plot uninteresting. Rowling has taken fictional bits and pieces from dozens of other children's books and whipped up a stew out of them which lacks originality and force. More grievously, there is an emptiness behind it all. A book for very, very easily entertained (and not very literate) children.	2001-12-14

She is deeply thoughtful, is in tune with all the contemporary concerns, doubts, questions, and yearnings about religious faith and experience, and writes with such warmth that I could easily imagine myself bumping into her at a retreat house and approaching her as if she were an old friend. She isn't sure about everything so if an author voicing her doubts bothers you, you may want to move on to another volume. The rest of us will get much from this. At a time when the spiritual sections in the bookstores seem to be flooded with new age feel-good tripe, it is so refreshing to read someone who realizes there is more to faith and spirituality than getting a &quot;feel-good&quot; fix every now and then that demands nothing from us in return and, consequently, holds no possibility of growth.

Without anything in life being worthwhile or having value, the authors are left with nothing to write down on paper but the logical conclusions of their own unfettered pathologies and lowest instincts. In this one, a group of children poison the father of one of the children for little reason except that he has given up the macho life of a sailor for the domesticity of married life and family. Lovely. It is a horrifying tale but there should be no prizes given for shocking people as all it takes is nerve and the willingness to find what little is still considered sacred and then heap contempt on it (in this case, the value of human life). The translation is very well done but to no matter. This is philosophical and psychological pathology. Since the only logical conclusion to the nihilistic philsophy is suicide, it is little wonder that Mishima ended up disemboweling himself after a ludicrous attempt to stage a revolution in Japan failed. This is shock literature, exquisitely - one might say decadently and hedonistically rendered - and adds up to a big nothing in the grand scheme of things. Reading it is an unpleasant experience - and nothing more.	2001-05-07

I got the impression that even Kelley became bored of her subject but had a contract to fulfill. This time, however, she aimed too high.

It really is a dull, creaky, moldy hymn to the belief that science can substitute for religion. Wrong. In a materialist universe, nihilism is the only point of view justified by the facts and the only objection to even crimes against humanity such as genocide is that you don't personally like it (as Bertrand Russell admitted). Every evil and every good become nothing but a matter of personal taste and the terms have no other meaning. Disapproving of murder has no more moral weight than preferrring relish to onions on your hot dogs. Sorry, Carl, we can't sustain any kind of humane world on what you have to offer.Besides, it seems to me that many of the things that science has brought us has actually made the world worse (bio-terrorism, nuclear weapons, the complete medicalization of human existence, the Tuskeegee syphillis experiments, etc). And don't give me that line about how science is pure and it is only when humans misuse it that it becomes evil. The same thing could be said about the religions that you so despise. The diference is that the great religions have a self correcting moral vision and are capable of reform. Science lacks, and can never have, a moral vision. It (and scientists) always sells itself out to the largest corporate bidder. Don't talk about science, Carl, talk about science, inc., since that is the only way it exists.

I approached this book expecting a rambling schizoid work by someone who was mentlaly unbalanced. Instead, Swedenborg is a clear and articulate writer, his theology is perfectly sensible and well thought out, there is an internal logic to what he writes that extends throughout his writings. I don't know what to make of his claim that he was appointed to be a prophet to mankind and to explain this to us all. It would be easy to dismiss it outright if his writing was a mess and his ideas insane. But his writing is clear and organized and his theology is so sensible that his books leave you bewildered. If he didn't claim to converse with angels, he would be considered a fine theologian who came up with a very practical and humane vision of christianity. His theology is perfectly suited to the modern world. But Swedenborg was absolutely convinced that he was a seer. Therein lies the problem of what to make of him. It is clear that he was utterly sincere. That sincerity combined with a valuable collection of writings makes him an individual to reckon with. Many people have struggled to come to a definite opinion about Swedenborg's claims. You may end up one, also.	2001-01-24

Deeply influenced by the quietist/pietist movements of time (they recommended complete passivity in the spiritual life so that God could supposedly do all his work by grace without any of our participation), it doesn't avoid the very excesses that this orthodox catholic priest hoped to correct in an effort to keep people within the church. The theme of the book is that we should all simply abandon the outcomes of all of our actions to God and live in trust. Simple enough, but the book seems to advocate a passivity that, I think, can become a self-fulfilling prophesy of bad outcomes. You have to have some sort of goal in your mind in order to work toward something worthwhile. It is fair enough for a believing person to deal with disappointment by accepting failure with peace and humility-&quot;it just wasn't God's will that I succeed at X. God wishes me to do something else&quot; but this book crosses that line into the following philosophy: &quot;Everything is in God's hands. There is no use having any goals or striving for anything since only God can bring success and to be ambitious for anything is to set yourself up for failure or sacriledge. Better to just be a passive fatalist and see what God brings me&quot;. This book does away with the sense that we are also active in creation and our lives. Instead, God becomes the only active agent and we are &quot;spiritual&quot; to the degree that we become passive observers of our own lives and God's grace. It is a prescription for fatalism, passivity, and the complete neglect of our talents and prsonalities. What would have been so much better would have been an approach that encourages all of our efforts but with a sense of humility as we strive to succeed, making clear that disease, disaster, disappointment can strike at anytime and that only time will tell how much and to what degree our plans and God's plansmatched (usually not very closely!).THEN, and only then, should we stop fighting the inevitable and accept what is now clearly God's will with peace, humility, and tranquility. But to give up all striving beforehand is bad advice and presumptious.	2001-01-21

I left the book feeling toward the author as if he were someone I would never want to deal with. An unsavory revelation of a man who I once thought of as a clever comic talent but now see as a creep. If anyone finds his essays here about quadraplegics and very poor working people (and their homes, which he loves to make fun of) funny, you are welcome to join the creepy human society of which Sedaris is now an honorary member. Too bad Sedaris is too shallow to be able to mix his humour with a bit of pity and warmth. He might rise above the merely vulgar and predictable misanthropy which he wallows in and become a first class humourist. An adolescent attempt at humour that goes nowhere and isn't funny. Stick with &quot;Me talk pretty some day&quot; and &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; if you are looking for laughs.	2001-01-17

Contemporary English is one thing. Idiomatic English falling into slang and the inarticulate emphatic language pattens of the completely uneducated is another. This is most glaring in the Psalms and Proverbs. What should be beautiful and pithy become commonplace. Peterson's methods work well in the pastoral Pauline letters, for the most part, as they are suited to the subject matter of those epistles. I'm afraid this waters down the rest of the Bible, however. Think of this as &quot;The Living Bible&quot; translation with a street attitude. Yuck.	2000-12-31

Anyone who attempts to follow it today to the letter needs to have their head (and heart) examined, though. He advocates physical beatings and other cruelties, even of the young. His advice that each monk be provided with no more than a pound of bread as their sole food daily provides no more than 1200 calories-an amount certain to lead to malnutrition in many people.Yes, I understand that Benedict was laying down rules for large communities in another age and era. Now, if only those who think that we should use this as a guide TODAY would only accept that this is not the middle ages and the context NOW makes many ancient texts irelevant. Read this for spiritual reading?! To what purpose? You can spend your time more profitably with another book that does not require another volume of commentary to expain, and apologize for it.	2000-12-30

I have tried to take up this practice in the past but have given it up as it usually requires several books, a dozen or so ribbon markers, and an intimate knowledge of the complexities of the liturgical calendar in order to do it. What should be a prayerful experience seemed to me to be a physical and mental juggling act that was tedious and wearying. What Phyllis Tickle has done is to use the calendar we all use, put all (or most-the repetitive night prayers are in one monthly section) of the prayers on one or two pages and put one ribbon (really all you need) in the binding. The prayers are available for each day for morning, evening, and night. If you wish, there are prayers for noon also. Having followed this volume for a period, I can say that my own personal experience is that this is a wonderful devotion which I intend to keep up. There is enough variety to hold your interest and it is simple and easy to follow. Those short one and two week prayerbooks quickly become old. Here is a different arrangement and selection for every day. I thought this was an excellent publishing idea. I am an individual who is struggling with issues of faith, belief, meaning, church, etc. I wanted some type of organized prayer that I could do in private as I grow/read/learn slowly at my own pace and this volume has been just what I needed at this point in my life. I need only open this book and spend a bit of time in prayer and throught. I have even tried chanting when alone and that has been rewarding. This book has helped me come closer to a God I am trying to learn about more. If you are looking for an easy way to do the Hours but need more variety than simple prayerbooks give, give this one a try.  One final note:I am amused at the number of reviews here that pillory this volume because it does not use inclusive language. If this volume DID, in fact, do so, I know that I would be turned off. Short of rewriting every bit of literature authored before 1990, non-inclusive language must be accepted as part of the time and cultural restraints that form the context that all literature, sacred and profane, is written in. There was a &quot;politically correct&quot; Bible published a few years ago, which attempted to offend no one,including left-handers. It was a financial and critical failure and you will be lucky to find one at a bargain table these days. I am deeply suspicious of any political group (feminist, gay (-my own group), black, etc.) imposing its ideology by censoring and altering the words of authors who can no longer defend the unasked for editing of their texts. As far as being offended by the abundance of male pronouns used for God, only a simpleton cannot see past the metaphors. We know that &quot;God&quot; is gender neutral but the substitution of &quot;goddess&quot; cannot be as that is clearly feminine. One wonders how these feminists would deal with French where EVERYTHING has a gender and the language simply cannot be bent to fit in with ideology as English might be if enough violence is done to it.	2000-12-29

I never found  the man funny, just odd. I picked this book up with the hope that I would  understand his strangeness. I was disappointed. The author doesn't seem to  understand his own subject. Was Kaufman mentally ill? A moderate sociopath?  A strongly anti-social personality? The author never discusses these  possibilities and doesn't offer any theory of his own. This left me with  the feeling that the six years the author spent on this biography consisted  of very little reflection. This book also suffers because it lacks an  index. A so-so work.	2000-08-19

Huffington's book was picked up in a moment of disgust and cynicism. I  found it to be like a breath of fresh air. She spells the problems out  clearly, takes no prisoners, offers solutions that are workable and made  feel as if I was not alone in my thinking. I like her saucy approach. She  has guts, heart, and brains. I hope she tries to run for office again.

She appeared to be highly sexual, intelligent, and to be marching to the sound of a drummer that she alone  heard within herself. It turns out that she was all of this. This is an  excellent biography and a lesson about what happens to those who despise  the opportunities that life presents to us and to those whose lives are  driven by sex rather than common sense. Louise Brooks was a very modern  woman despite having been a star of the silent screen. She made only a few  films but her performances in those films stand up with the great  performances of today and their naturalism makes the acting of most silent  screen starlets seem idiotic. While other actresses were concerned with  nothing but their looks, Brooks was reading Shaw and Proust. While others  did all they could to ingratiate themselves with the movie studios, Brooks  had nothing but indifference for them. She turned her back on fame,  fortune, and power. She could have had a brilliant career but always  sabotaged her chances. She had beauty and incredible sex appeal. She had  Chaplin as a lover. She wrote. She lives on today as an image of a woman  ahead of her time and also as a tragic waste. Her own difficult personality  drove everyone away. Her lack of discipline was childish. She fascinates.  This is the best biography we will ever get of her. Recommended.	2000-08-01

The editors asked 250 activists, celebrities (former 1950's bathing beauty/actress Esther  Williams wants the USA to investigate the JFK assasination AGAIN (! )), and  assorted individuals to come up with suggestions which would make the USA a  better country. The results are depressing because of their simple  mindedness, cliched and PC-like platitudes, shallowness, and the  over-reliance on entertainment figures to fill this volume. Some of the  suggestions here border on the grotesque. Some are so transparently cynical  or sarcastic that they contribute to a deepening sense of malaise about the  awful state of civic involvement in this country. Less than a dozen  suggestions here are truly practical and would have any noticeable effect  if put into practice - a dismal result. My guess is that the editors knew  that few in the USA today would buy a book featuring truly thoughtful and  well-educated contributors - so, bring on those rap artists and movie  stars!  A sad commentary on the state of the nation and the mental state of  those who presume to be watching over the political process.	2000-08-01

It was my observation that the ONLY men who observed celibacy for any length of time were those one or two odd individuals with such low libidos as to be medical anomalies. Everyone else  either left or compromised by finding discreet male or female partners.  Celibacy is simply not meant for red blooded men-and no amount of prayer is  going to lower your testosterone levels anymore than prayer could lower  your thyroid levels! That is a simple fact which the Church chooses to  ignore. Well, they aren't fooling anyone, as most men in the street think  the priesthood is a hiding place for &quot;half-men&quot; and gays. I was  also taken aback by the high levels of alcoholism in the priesthood-but the  loneliness would get to anyone, I suppose. Denial, denial, denial-that's  all it is and will ever be. I assumed that the church's plan for being  celibate (prayer, fasting, the sacraments) would work for me because I was  told it would. Well, it doesn't work for anyone and it is about time that  those thinking about entering seminary be told the truth so they don't  waste the most important years of their lives (as I did) trying to do what  is simply not possible or even worth doing (married protestant clerics do  quite well without being saddled by cleibacy).	2000-07-03

I had recently finished a biography of Gershwin and  thoroughly enjoyed it. Comparing the two men was inevitable. They both  composed a tremendous amount of music and were very disciplined when it  came to their craft. There the similarity ended. Gershwin was always  pushing his limits and developing as a composer. Cole Porter pretty much  settled for being a tunesmith- a very clever and witty one, though.  Gershwin was always working and learning. Porter was always partying -  booze, drugs, and sex. It is amazing that he was able to stand up,  nevermind sit down for several hours at the piano everyday to compose, no  matter what his activities of the night before. While Gerhswin's life  reveals a composer striving for ever increasing greatness, Porter's life is  pretty superficial and shallow - consisting of one party after another with  the &quot;beautiful people&quot;. It was a bit of a shock to see that his  life was as shallow and mindless as it was and wouldn't add up to much of  anything if it were not for his incredible talent. Wealthy beyond most of  our dreams, he seems to have been oblivious and/or indifferent to the  Depression and the great World War - my guess is that he probably saw them  as little more than pesty distractions from his round of parties. With  Gershwin, you admire his talent, his discipline, his striving, his  willingness to take musical risks after he had become wealthy. With Cole  Porter - well, there is always his talent.	2000-06-01

There is nothing original here. If you have read any of  the New Thought texts written in the 50 years prior to the publishing of  this volume, you will recognize all of the usual themes. This is a  &quot;lite&quot; version of Christian Science without the dogmatism or the  controlling &quot;Mother Church&quot; breathing down your neck to make sure  you don't dare think for yourself. Worse, it isn't very moving as Holmes  was no more than a merely competent writer. The prose here never rises  above the &quot;Reader's Digest&quot; school of writing. When the author of  a &quot;spiritual&quot; book borrows every one of his ideas from elsewhere  (without any credit, I might add - Hmm, I wonder what Science of Mind says  about stealing?) and then presents them in a flat prose style that adds  nothing to them, I suspect that his motives have more to do with business  than with enlightenment. This book will seem like news if you have never  read any New Thought literature before. To the rest of us, it is simply a  rehash.	2000-05-10

My answer is that it probably is not. Much of the book  consists of very authoritarian pronouncements that are meant to be accepted  simply because they are said. This is the &quot;believe me or else!&quot;  school of religion - not my favorite way of having a diety interact with  me, on even my best day. There are many, many sections of this volume  devoted to praising God and this got tiresome quickly. There are some  curious variant readings on stories found in the Old Testament and New  Testament which I found neither enlightening nor inspiring. As I had to  read this in English, rather than the original Persian, I cannot tell if it  is as poetic as is claimed by some. I can say, however, that this  translation does not give any sense of the poetry that may or may not be in  the original as it is simply servicable english. There are many very long  and dry passages contained here that I could find nothing of interest in  and which seemed repetitious and pointless. I finished this book with an  empty feeling and some disappointment that a book with such a great  reputation could leave me so unmoved or impressed. I do not know who the  author of the Koran was, but it does not matter to me a bit as I will not  be returning to it as a spiritual resource.	2000-05-10

I believe that it is possible to review a book on its own merits without tackling the subject of authorship. The question I am addressing is this: &quot;what is  the value of the Book of Mormon as a spiritual resource?&quot;. I have read  this book and it was a difficult read. And it was difficult to read not   because it contains concepts that were hard to grasp but because there was  so little of interest in it. Claiming to be the record of one of the lost  tribes of Israel as they traveled to America and settled and battled there  among themselves, it is a literary drag. There are many battles in this  book whose description suggests that they were written by someone who had  never seen a fistfight, nevermind a war. They are lacking in all drama - a  difficult feat when one is recording one of the most dramatic of human  conflicts. One would think that any writer on war would be an easy success  if he were to only report what he eyewitnessed. The language throughout the  Book of Mormon is either severely wooden or a sort of ersatz lazy King  James dialect that sounds so very much clumsier than the sometimes high  poetics of the King James Version Bible. The author of the Book of Mormon  (whoever it was) was no writer and the various smaller books within this  volume, though claiming to be by different authors, never rise above the  writing level of pulp fiction galdiator/cowboy novels. I did not find  anything here of spiritual value. The occasional tired platitudes mouthed  by the characters were said more effectively by the Old Testament heroes in  the Bible. When Jesus finally appears (according to the Book of Mormon,  Jesus appears in America after His resurrection appearances to the  disciples), His words are simply a repetition of what we find in the New  Testament. His appearance to the characters in this book resembled the  crude and stagy theatrics of the silent film version of &quot;King of  Kings&quot;. I did not find anything inspiring or moving in this volume.  The little that was notable was entirely reminiscent of the Bible - and  added nothing to what was written there. What is left (95% of this book) is  simply not memorable for any reason - literary, dramatically, historically,  spiritually, or as devotional literature. This is not a book that could  have a life of its own apart from the backing of a powerful organization.  Truly profound spiritual books live and succeed independently of organized  religious bodies because of their intrinsic worth. I do not think that this  is one of those.	2000-05-03

After a few weeks, I noticed an improvement in my virility, my sense of well being, and my energy level. So far, so good. Then, a curious thing  began to occur. I found that I was getting angry at events and people which  normally would only annoy me. I didn't think much of it at the time until  this problem became worse and worse. After a few more weeks, I was in a  nearly constant state of rage. I felt aggressive and angry all of the time.  I was dealing with overwhelming feelings of anger several hours a day -  even when lying on the beach on my days off!  I started on sedatives to  calm me down and to let me sleep. Finally, when I could not take it anymore  and I was hating the type of man I was turning into, I decided that the few  benefits of DEHA were simply not worth the stress, anger, anxiety I was  going through and putting others through. I stopped DHEA and began to  return to normal within several days. I have no doubt that this hormone  caused me all of this trouble - probably by raising my testosterone level  to neanderthal levels. Ok, so now I may not have the virility of an 18 year  old (although I have since discovered that high exercise levels will  improve that area dramatically) and I may not have all of the energy that I  would like, but I like myself now and others like me better. I think this  is, like melatonin was a few years ago, a big hype with no other purpose  except to sell pills and books until we realize that we have all been had -  again!	2000-05-03

To get it, he may allow us to stumble on  without any sense of his presence or obtaining any pleasure from our  spiritual exercises or even our life. All that will be left us is our  decision to continue doing our duty despite not receiving any apparent gain  from doing so. According to St. John, this is what pleases God more than  anything for then we will serve God solely for Himself and not for any good  feelings, sensations, or rewards we might experience by doing so. Whatever  the validity of this spiritual approach (and I wonder about the value/point  of sanctifying depression in this age of anti-depressants), St. John wrote  this detailed book to explore it and did it better than anyone else has  ever done. That makes it an important contribution to the literature on  spirituality. But it also makes it something that most people will not be  able to fathom or have any use for. The hours of daily prayer required by  the school of thought that produced this book seem to me excessive and to  miss the whole point of the Christian life. Most of us would be driven mad  by such intensity-and I don't doubt that some have been. I tend to think  that doing our duty is sometimes just work (true) but also sometimes will  give a great sense of fulfillment and satisfaction because there are  intrinsic rewards that come with  being a good worker, spouse, parent,  friend, etc. There is little point in getting this book unless you live in  a cloister or are planning to do so and only if God is calling you to the  depths of contemplative prayer. That leaves out 98% of the human race,  including me. This is a dry treatise; admirable without being in the least  bit inspiring. It is best left to graduate courses in  spirituality or  medieval Spanish literature (the poem is reportedly excellent Spanish  poetry).	2000-04-18

I am not one of them. The main (and, perhaps, the only) theme to this book is to put aside  every other consideration but the service of God. Superficially, this  sounds good, but the author (like many extremists) forgets that we serve  God in our daily life in mostly indirect ways-simply by the performance of  our duties as workers, spouses, parents, children, and by being friends to  each other. &quot;Pushing aside every other consideration&quot; seems to be  a good formula for fanaticism and for losing our well rounded and fully  developed humanity. I once heard a saying that, in effect, stated that  &quot;Mr. so-and- so was so holy he was useless&quot;. And, most probably,  unbearable to all those around him, also. I think poorly of devotional  books that urge me to push aside the world and the people in it to make  room for God and His service. I figure I am put here for a reason and that  reason can't possibly be to choose God as opposed to the people He created  and put me in the midst of (as if one had to choose one or the other!).  That suggests that all of these people are mistakes and distractions, an  appalling suggestion. Thanks, Oswald, but I prefer meditation books that  give me the inspiration and strength to carry on in the world with the  notion that God cares a great deal about what He created-and wants me to  care also.	2000-04-18

It is easy to be charmed by this guide to the spiritual life. He inspires the reader with a gentle, loving touch which I found  delightful. He was also a very learned and experienced adviser when it came  to things of the spirit. He seemed to have known about every difficulty  that one has in the spiritual life and offers practical and wise solutions  that anyone can carry out. If you are interested in reading the great  spiritual classics, be certain not to miss this one. It will  be well worth  your time. I cannot imagine anyone finishing this volume without obtaining  some excellent advice from it and also without making progress just from  reading it. The only drawback is that it IS several hundreds years old and  some of the theology is dated and will seem strange to modern, post Vatican  2 Christians. Do not let that keep you from this book, just keep it in mind  when reading it. Highly recommended.	2000-04-09

Staggeringly intelligent, talented as a leader, reformist, and writer, powerful as a personality, this is the type of woman who was born to make  history no matter what era she would have been born in. There has never  been anyone else like her. She posessed wit and great common sense. She was  also one of the greatest mystics who ever lived. Her life is more  enlightening than imitable as no one else could ever hope to aspire to the  heights that she reached in the many areas that she excelled in. I don't  see how the average person not living in a cloister could use this as a  spiritual guide. It is on too high a plane. Her life is a real page  turner-and an odd one at times as she describes in detail her ecstatic  swoons and transports that to modern readers have something unmistakably  erotic about them. But there is no doubting her veracity on these matters,  there just is a certain embarassment at times at reading her completely  artless way of relating these matters where she does not seem to be aware  at all of what she is saying and how she is saying it. I don't recommend  this as a spiritual guide for the general public but I do think that it is  a very unusual and worthwhile autobiography which is unlike any other you  will ever read. Those just reading this for her life story can skip the  long detailed spirtual sections. I am full of admiration for Teresa of  Avila and think she is a very good writer.	2000-04-09

Tom Wolfe reveals himself to be  an extraordinary novelist, perhaps the greatest living novelist, in my  opinion. This novel surveys every strata of American society with wit,  astounding clarity and analysis, and remarkable talent skill. I found the  book to be one of the most pleasurable, and at the same time, most  harrowing reads I have ever had. Everything from the wealthiest lives of  our most extravagantly and absurdly rich citizens to the lowest and most  frightening population of a prison are detailed here with the unflinching  eye of the reporter, satirist and artist. Nearly every chapter reads like a  well crafted set piece. This novel is about money, power, America, manhood,  redemption. It is the last theme that is not as convincingly explored as I  would have wished. The flaw lies in those troublesome final pages where it  almost seems as if the author could not wait to get the thing finsihed and  out of his way. If only he had given a few weeks more to it!	2000-04-05

Several have tried to bring the devotional classic, &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; into the twentieth century and all have failed. I can think  of few  devotional books as morose and melancholy as this one. I have attempted to  read it on several occasions due to its reputation throughout Christian  history but have never been able to draw any strength or comfort from a  work whose message consists of these themes: &quot;Abandon the world and  hate it&quot;, &quot;Withdraw from all people into yourself&quot;,  &quot;Think often of death and judgment&quot;. This is Christianity!  It  sounds like the scribblings of a manic-depressive in need of Prozac and  some long term attitude adjustment!  A real downer. Not something that  would encourage me to continue with my day to day reading and meditation  time. Where is the encouragement and refreshment that one would expect from  devotional reading? How in the dickens is someone supposed to draw strength  from a book that seems designed to rob you of all positive emotions and  hopes? The emphasis here is on everything dark and depressing that one can  imagine. It is my opinion that one would have to distort the message of the  New Testament to an incredible degree to make the message of &quot;The  Imitation&quot; be in synchrony with it. One further point: while the cross  of Jesus is mentioned over and over and over in this, I do not recall a  single mention of the Resurrection of Jesus-which shows how distorted this  is if it fails to see any point worth mentioning to the central mystery of  Christianity, right?	2000-04-03

As far as I know, all of the available translations in print are either terribly academic or use Victorian language. This is NOT a translation but a very  free, very loose paraphrase and condensation. I knew I was in trouble when  I read the introduction. The author slams Western philosophy for being too  cerebral and for not dealing sufficiently with the irrational aspects of  life. She obviously does not like the use of reason to deal with day to day  life. Then why, I might ask, is she paraphrasing a philosopher who is one  of the presursors to modern rational psychotherapy? Like many Westerners  who dabble in Eastern philosophy and only know it superficially, she  assumes that it speaks more directly to the needs of people than Western  philosophy. This despite the fact that Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus,  Epictetus, etc. were immensely popular with the general population of  ancient times. So much so, in fact, that common citizens wore rings and  bought mirrors with sayings of Epicurus on them and Socrates could be  lampooned in a popular comedy. Stoicism was the unoffical religion of the  roman army-not an elitist, irrelevant teaching. And Epicureanism had  widespread allegiance and was able to fill huge communities all throughout  the ancient world. The most popular devotional books of the 17th and 18th  century were all basically rewrites of the ancient Greeks. By the time the  introduction was finished, I knew that I was in for a very trendy,  inaccurate rendering of Epictetus. The worst chapter has to be the one  called &quot;Avoid casual sex&quot;. Being familiar with Epictetus, I would  love to know where the author found anything in his works which would  justify her stating that an active sex life is okay &quot;within a  framework of personal commitment&quot;. Epictetus believed that men and  women should perform their moral duty no matter how difficult. That meant  sex only within marriage-not some absurd arrangement that is, as the author  says, &quot;within a framework of personal commitment&quot; which could  mean anything-and usually does. Epictetus felt that men and women had a  duty to something greater than their own personal ideas of what they  thought that their duties and commitments might be at any particular  moment. Individuals are citizens of a wider community and what they do  should lend harmony to the larger community. Their behavior is not  determined by trends but by the highest standards. Moderns may not like  that. It goes against their grain. Fine, but don't distort Epictetus just  to make people feel good. Epictetus, who never minced words, would never  flatter his audience or offer a salve to their conscience. I think that  Epictetus, the moral rigorist, would have been appalled. His teachings are  very stern and difficult. That's why stoicism is both greatly admired and,  also, widely rejected. It is a philosophy of moral battle and psychological  toughness in a world where, as Tom Wolfe says in &quot;A Man in Full&quot;  &quot;principles are dead&quot;. When individuals feel they are surrounded  by nothing but corruption, injustice, and irresponsibility and feel that  they are victims of the same and can do little about any of it, Stoicism   shows a way to salvation, a way to preserve your integrity and peace of  mind even when you are working for a corporation run by modern day Nero's  (are there any other kind?), or suffering physically and mentally from the  stress of modern life and its overwhelming evils. Stocisim urges us all to  be good men and women even-especially-when it is tough to do so. Epictetus  teaches that the happy life is the virtuous one. Watering down his message  is doing a disservice to him. Rather than claiming that this is Epictetus  speaking, the author should have simply mentioned that it was inspired by  some Stoic ideas. That is all it truly is.	2000-03-31

What happened is that they indulged their lowest animal passions and lived lives that went out of  control. All of this would be just one more trashy rock star biography  except that Angie Bowie seems to have no regrets and no insights about any  of this, even years after the facts. Some show biz bios try to gloss over  the ugly excesses of their subjects or attempt to rationalize their moral  slovenliness and show that on SOME level that the subject isn't exactly  proud of all that he/she did. Not this one. The author just throws it all  in the reader's face with a &quot;So what? Who cares?&quot; attitude. This  is what made this book fascinatingly vulgar, and unintentionally hilarious.  I shared it with a friend and he found it to be one of the funniest things  he had read in months. The author seems to be daring ANYONE to object to  anything she or David Bowie did with what she must consider to be nothing  but moldy and irrelevant moral reservations. I have news for the author:  the parade has passed her by. People are tired of irresponsibility,  substance abuse, wasteful living, promiscuity, and cheating. David comes  across as whacked out on drugs and in need of critical psychiatric help  during the period this was written. Did anyone around him-all of those  hanging on to his fame and celebrity-bother to help help him? Doesn't look  like it from the evidence here. Luckily, he did clean up his life years  later-no thanks to his worthless &quot;friends &quot;.	2000-03-24

The author does especially well in his discussion of the anthropic principle-that the fundamental constants  of the universe can only support life within a very narrow range and that  of all of the possible values of those constants, only the life supporting  ones have occurred. Those who object that this is meaningless because,  &quot;well, if it didn't support life, we would not be here to think about  it&quot; are missing the point. The miracle is not that man can think about  his existence; the miracle is that he exists-and could only exist if the  unverse were extremely fine tuned to a degree that just does not seem  possible by chance alone. It is not a question of perception, as the  reviewer below has stated, but of existence. I think the author does a very  good job of showing how meaningful this is and how silly those sound who  try to get out of the obvious conclusion. Having been around atheists all  of my life, I can assure you that they are some of the most dogmatic people  around and hide their own unscientific thinking and dogmatism behind a  transparent and artful appeal to a type of argument that is dishonest. Less  successful, I think, is the author's discussion of near death experiences.  Since so many NDE's take on the characteristics of the individual's  particular religion, it is difficult for me to see how there is anything  objective about NDE's. They seem to be a very subjective experience. I  liked this book and recommend it as one of the better books on this subject  out there. The author also show how morally bankrupt any attempt to develop  a set of ethics is without some transcendent values. Let's face it, any  thorough and consistent materialistic viewpoint is bound to lead to moral  nihilisim sooner or later.	2000-03-19

Autistics are notoriously lacking in the knowledge and sense  that others are fully developed individuals with mental outlooks that are  not identical to their own and have a validity equal to their own.

Hamm is a retired speech-language pathologist who specialized in the treatment of stuttering. This book tells the therapist exactly WHAT to do with his stuttering clients. Too many  books on the subject spend too much time on theory and offer little  practical information. Not Hamm. As I am determined to read everything ever  written on the subject of stuttering, I was delighted to read a book by  someone willing to share their techniques and who also could present his  information in a clear and sometimes humourous way. Hamm, by the way,  has  a killer wit. Example: he wonders if the push for &quot;person-first&quot;  terminology (ex: &quot;stutterers&quot; become &quot;persons who sometimes  stutter&quot;) should be naturally extended to clinicians, who, perhaps,  should no longer be called &quot;speech therapists&quot; but &quot;persons  who sometimes practice speech-language pathology as a profession&quot;.  There is a lot of common sense in this volume, and more techniques and tips  than you ever thought existed. Some of it may be dated (most therapists  today opt for a combination of stuttering modification and fluency shaping)  but this is a great read for anyone interested in this subject. It will  also give you a good deal of insight as to what exactly master clinicans  have been doing all of these years. For those wanting to specialize in  fluency disorders, this is a keeper.	2000-01-16

Goldberg's approach is so  obvious once you read it-so why hasn't anyone else thought of this before?  It helps if you also have degrees in other fields as Goldberg has  (philosophy, political theory)-you are more likely to be able to think in  novel ways than if you have confined yourself to the literature of only one  field.

Like twelvetone music, it may make sense intellectually, but  very few people will ever enjoy it. Sagan simplistically thinks that people  are not rational because the truth has been held from them by the powers  that be. Most people do know plenty about science and guess what? They  still don't buy the whole rational outlook on life. It is about as  attractive as a petri dish. Most people have, by definition, only average  intelligence. Exhorting them to give up the comforts of religion in  exchange for some abstract intellectulizing is to ask them to give up  something they can understand for something they will never be able to  relate to. An intellectual elitist such as Sagan has no comforting words  for anyone struggling through life on limited income/intelligence and with  limited access to the tools and resources that he takes for granted. A  rational outlook is one that can only appeal to a very, very few  individuals with a certain type of temperament. Sagan and his ilk are  howling at the moon when they lament that so many of their fellow beings do  not embrace their cold outlook. Although they are well informed about the  nature of the universe, they do not understand the first thing about human  beings. The result is that rationalism will always be no more than a cult  with a very small membership.	1999-12-27

Even though I know that this is a medical reference work, it is downright frightening to see page after page of diseases, conditions, and medical emergencies having to do with gay sex. It is something of an anti-aphrodisiac to have so much  information. This book gives me ammunition when some criticize me for not  being sexually adventurous enough. You would have to be crazy to do some of  the more bizarre practices after reading this book. This is a good book,  but frankly, I would rather just limit my practices rather than risk some  of these conditions and diseases. One regret: am I the only one who  suspects that a lot of promiscuity is due to a lot of attention deficit  disorder men not being under medication? It seems to be the only rational  explanation for the seeming inability to stay focused on one partner for  any length of time!	1999-12-25

I considered him one of the great, cutting edge scholars of my lifetime. His scholarship made a difference because he uncovered new information which had serious social  consequences. Only a few academics in a generation can be said to make a  serious difference in society and Boswell was one of them. To read his work  and realize the herculean efforts he must have taken in order to bring his  books to life made one appreciate this man who worked for the good of  others. I will ignore the reviewer below who reveals much about himself  when he seeks to dimiss Boswell's work by exploiting Boswell's cause of  death. Work of such stature as Boswell's had cannot be dismissed by such  oooze and slime. This is a monumental work which challenges the opposition  to come up with their own scholarly (not cheap) response, something that  has not arrived up to this point-and shows no sign of arriving any time  soon	1999-12-25

Marcus Aurelius was emperor of Rome with an unfaithful wife, a worthless son, and the duties of leading an army for 13 years in what is now Germany.  Trying to cheer and console himself in the middle of a desolate area, he  wrote down what he remembered of the Stoic philosophy which he had studied.  His thoughts are inspiring and provoking. This is the book you want with  you when life becomes tough. As Marcus' view of god is a pantheistic one,  anyone can profit from his thoughts, whether atheist or believer. A book to  read ever few years. Highly recommended.	1999-11-17

It is also one of the most amazing accomplishments Man has produced. Not easy reading, it is worth working through. By logical  argument piled on top of each preceding argument, Spinoza states that  &quot;God&quot; is co-equal with the universe (he was a pantheist) and  details a remarkable analysis of the emotions and how we can best direct  them so as to reach tranquility of mind. He does this all with what must  have been an astonishingly powerful mind with rare skills of analysis. The  odd structure he chose may not have been the best vehicle for his  philosophy but it was based on the then popular Cartesian method. A truly  magnificent view of religion, life and the universe. While there have never  been many followers of Spinoza's system, its influence has been felt  throughout philsophy. This book is a monument to what the human mind is  capable of. A landmark in Western civilization.	1999-11-14

Unless you are a scholar, there is  precious little here to justify your spending money to acquire this book  unless cost is not a problem for you. I borrowed it from a University and  was finished reading it in one afternoon. It does contain half a dozen  maxims which MAY be by Epicurus, however. For the scholar, yes. For the  general student of Epicurus, no.	1998-08-22
