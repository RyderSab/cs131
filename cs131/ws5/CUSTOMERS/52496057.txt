It comes after \\"Superman:Endgame\\" (where Lex Luthor rebuilt Metropolis using the Brainiac-13 technology) and \\"Batman:No Man's Land\\" (where Lex Luthor rebuilt the earthquake-ravaged Gotham City). This time, Lex Luthor goes for the big prize - the U.S. Presidency. And no, this is NOT an Imaginary Story! <br /> <br />This book charts his campaigns, his ascendency, an assassination attempt on his life to boost ratings and finally Lex Luthor's swearing in as the 43rd President of the United States. Superman and JLA, with all their diverse powers, was unable to stop the \\"democratic process\\" and Luthor ends up as the Prez. In between, you have stories of an Atlantean attack led by Aquaman and Tempest, and also a visit by Bizarro #1. <br /> <br />The writing is mainly by Jeph Loeb, Mark Schultz and Greg Rucka. Pretty solid monthly work by the team. The book lists dozens of artists. Ed McGuiness stands out as the best of the bunch. Tony Harris, of Starman fame, turns in an issue featuring Luthor's rise to power - with eerily life-like art. The Christmas issue with many guest artists (Art Adams, Humberto Ramos, Joe Madureira, Ian Churchill, Rob Liefeld, Mike Wieringo, etc.) is also a highlight.	2005-08-29

To get the reader to understand the premise of the story, various references from movies like Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Mission Impossible II and Soldier of Fortune 2. Why? This is because this story has plot devices (McGuffins) like: <br /> <br />1) A girl injected with virus (RE:A) <br />2) Virus search and destroy (SOF2, MI2) <br /> <br />The story here is at its best as par of In The Beginning. Here we get to see more of Frank's psyche, his emotions, his feelings for the girl for the first time for more than 25 years. And eventually we get to see the exciting action moments in the story itself. Another element that viewers were shown were the inner workings of the U.S Military whereby its methods were much to the disgust of Nick Fury.  <br /> <br />Mother Russia includes the MAX version of Nick Fury here. He has more of the very crucial supporting role and he plays more of the political side rather than the usual commando stuff he's used to. We too get to see much of the Russian opposite, Zakharov - a man that fellow subordinates feared off and he in the end has much of a sense of respect for Frank, particularly his pushing antics. <br /> <br />Even though Dougie Braithwaite is new to the series, his art is one of the best in the series. Well detailed and well colored -muted as to give the harsh and violent feeling. However, what was missing in his art is that there are moments in the story that was missed out and was not depicted / illustrated here. <br /> <br />As mentioned, even though the story is well crafted, there some setbacks that makes this story fell short than In The Beginning. In here, there were several moments wasted that Nick Fury should be given too. Even though he talks but he didn't show enough presence to the story. Another one would be the weak Rawlins and the terrorist splinter subplot - arguably the weakest in the story. Nonetheless, the Rawlins subplot is crucial and it will be featured prominently in the next story arc: Up Is Down and Black Is White. <br /> <br />If you really want something that is as good as In The Beginning, just read it, there are some unforgettable moments in there that you might want to read over and over again. <br /> <br />[From my friend Melvin, in Malaysia]	2005-08-21

It was poorly edited - in truth, the book was released one month after the script was completed and lack of revisions and edits. However, there were several purposes: <br /> <br />1. Getting the characters together before the storm. <br />2. To tie up some loose ends before heading towards the end. <br /> <br />The story is usually divided into 5 parts as to show the main characters story - Perrin, Elayne, Rand, Matt and Egwene. The title alone describes of the legends of the Dark Hunt and its consequences, but then no one was caught in the midst of the realities of the Hunt - being in the dawn and sunset thing. <br /> <br />Most of the character stories were still in the hanging - with no significant changes and resolves. The Perrin story arc was the worst of all - he only appears in the first act of the story and one of the last chapters of the book. However, the Elayne story arc was the best of all - she has the resolve thing - an instinct never shown in the other main characters. Since WOT is about Rand and his story, not much is shown of Rand -something that makes the book weak than its previous and excellent Winter's Heart. <br /> <br />If for the sake of continuity, well you can get it, otherwise, it's going to be a dull thing to read. <br /> <br />[Reviewed by Melvin, from Malaysia]	2005-08-21

As in real-life events, Kitchen Irish starts after In the Beginning.  <br />Ever wonder what how, when or why Hell's Kitchen reveals its ugly site?  <br />This is where Kitchen Irish comes along. To get an average reader  <br />understand the premise of the story, Ennis has used various references from  <br />movies like Gangs of New York and The Devil's Own. In addition, Ennis  <br />has created some of the wonderful supporting characters from real-life  <br />celebrities or fictional characters such as Lucy Lawless, Martin Landau,  <br />Bill the Butcher, Mason Verger and whoever that you see.  <br /> <br />The gangs in Hell's Kitchen are fighting over a sum of $10 million - a  <br />will left by the late gang boss Nesbitt. To this end, every gang will  <br />slug it out toe to toe to reach for the prize at all costs, even if it  <br />means of having their members killed or causing a collateral damage  <br />which involves our vigilante. As it goes on and on, it seems that the gangs  <br />will have a hard understanding on Nesbitt's message to them which  <br />involves are harsh and punishing way of saying, \\"Will You Stop That? \\" or  <br />\\"No Rest For The Wicked.\\" <br /> <br />Kitchen Irish was the real opposite in terms of mood and tone depicted  <br />in In The Beginning. Ennis has brought back the black-comedy elements  <br />as seen in the Maxi series. The real highlight in this story arc is not  <br />the story itself but Leandro Fernandez's (Wolverine) art. Clean and  <br />better looking, it's totally different that what Lewis Larosa illustrated  <br />in the previous volume. The colors are brighter and have more variety,  <br />but one problem was that there are some inconsistencies in the  <br />character faces drawn in one frame compared to the previous frame. Nonetheless,  <br />Leandro's art was real good and thus he was brought in by Ennis to work  <br />on the next upcoming story arcs, The Slavers and Up Is Down, Black Is  <br />White. <br /> <br/>A lot of people asked of the lack of sex elements in the current  <br />series. One of the parts of the story is the only one moment in the series to  <br />have sex elements. Although the series has the highs on wanton violence  <br />and the language used, the real low was on the sex thing. As you can  <br />see, Frank doesn't do this ever since the family's murder. Another thing  <br />that makes the story fell short compared to In the Beginning is Frank  <br />himself. In here, Frank became more or less a secondary character and  <br />instead the gangs were given the priority first. Not much of the personal  <br />emotions of Frank elicit so often were shown here. <br /> <br />Anyway, it provides a relief to the cold mood in the previous volume.  <br />If you like the laughs, if you are a fan of Leandro's art or even like  <br />The Punisher, it's a good read really. Good but not that great. <br /> <br />[This review posted by my friend Melvin, also from Malaysia!]	2005-08-17

He's responsible for bringing the character back to greatness with his \\"Welcome Back, Frank\\" arc and immediately Marvel put him on the regular series. The first story from the regular series is collected in the \\"Army of One\\" paperback and this book, \\"Business As Usual\\" is the second collection from that same run. <br /> <br />This story collects three stories: <br />[1] Punisher rescues Don Casino, a godfather, from South America so that he can call a meeting in New York with the other dons. That way, he can wipe them all out in the same place. <br />[2] An overzealous reporter handcuffs himself to the Punisher to get the \\"scoop\\" on him. Needless to say, the results ain't pretty! <br />[3] Punisher fights Wolverine and an army of \\"Mini-Mes\\" <br /> <br />Garth's \\"Punisher\\" is constantly frowned upon by the literati of the comics world for its ultra-violence. In my opinion, anybody who thinks that this book is too violent should get his/her brains examined! The violence in this book is akin to that of \\"Tom & Jerry\\" cartoons or \\"Road Runner\\". It's meant to be over-the-top and funny. My problem with Ennis' \\"Punisher\\" is not the violence. After all, you're reading a book called \\"Punisher\\" - not \\"Betty and Veronica\\"! My problem is that Ennis seemed to be a little too flippant in his writing at times. While the pacing, the attitude, the humour, the freakish characters, etc. are all top-notch, something is still missing from the title (especially for us old fogies who grew up with the Steven Grant version of the character). I think the angst is no longer there. And after a while, the mindless violence and toilet-humour can get a little tired. Fortunately, Ennis realized this also and gave us \\"BORN\\", which led to his far-superior \\"Punisher\\" run on Marvel MAX presently.	2005-08-15

Just got this book from a friend and read it in one sitting. Donna Troy (aka Wonder Girl, Troia, Darkstar) is a DC Comics character with one of the most convoluted history ever. This volume collects her various origin stories in one volume for new readers (like me) who are trying to catch up on her stories - especially with the currently published miniseries \\"The Return of Donna Troy\\" that leads into \\"Infinite Crisis\\". <br /> <br />The first story is the justly classic \\"Who Is Donna Troy?\\" from New Teen Titans #38. This is Marv Wolfman and George Perez at the top of their game in the early 1980s. The highlight of the story is Dick Grayson using his detective skills to investigate the background of Donna Troy. It's essentially a \\"character-piece\\" and both Dick and Donna shines here. (The next issue begins \\"The Judas Contract\\", probably the beginning of the darkness that overcame the series...) <br /> <br />The second story came immediately after the aforementioned \\"Judas Contract\\" in Teen Titans #50, and is a ray of light after the doom and gloom of that particular tale. It's also a reward for longtime fans who'd invested time and money following the \\"soap-opera\\" parts of the series. It's the wedding of Donna Troy and Terry Long. Lots of wonderful vignettes from this one as nearly everyone who is anyone turned up for the wedding (including Marv Wolfman and George Perez, see if you can spot them!). <br /> <br />The next arc collected is the five-part story from the second New Titans series that redefined Donna Troy's life after the events of \\"Crisis On Infinite Earths\\". This arc introduces us to the Titans of Myth and how Donna was \\"kidnapped\\" by them as a baby. Marv Wolfman and George Perez reunites on this tale. Alas, the plotting is no longer as tight as their early 1980s work - and neither was the art. Perez's art, while still pretty impressive, had none of the super-tight, super-detailed, 15-panel-a-page magic of his earlier work on the title. All in all, it's acool cosmic tale and I like it quite a lot. <br /> <br />The final story in the book is from the Titans/Outsiders Secret Files comic. It's a eulogy for the recently deceased Donna Troy (from the \\"Graduation Day\\" storyline). This is rather adequate as the next collection coming soon will most likely be \\"The Return of Donna Troy\\" so this two books should make a nice pair. <br /> <br />Interestingly, none of the John Byrne revisions are included in this volume (only mentioned in-passing on one page). Those are the stories that affected Donna the most and link her once more to the post-Crisis Wonder Woman and the Amazons.  <br /> <br />All in all, this is a very good collection and I think DC should do more of these \\"character-spotlight\\" collections. I personally would like to have one volume books like this one to pass to people who are interested in certain less well known characters (e.g. Green Arrow, Martian Manhunter, Guy Gardner, Zatanna, etc.) <br /> <br />Recommended for fans of Greek mythology, Wonder Woman, Donna Troy, Nightwing (he's featured a lot!), Titans, Outsiders, Marv Wolfman, George Perez, Phil Jimenez, or just fine comic art in general.	2005-08-15

In this book he celebrates the greatest of them all - Allen Ginsberg. The genius of this book is that Sanders may have invented a totally new genre of writing - the poetic documentary. Poetry is not read but experienced, thus going through this book is like being immersed in the sights and sounds of Ginsberg's life from the 1920s to the 1990s. Therefore, this book comes off as more potent, more immediate and more intense than reading a \\"straight\\" biography, often coloured by the interpretive lens of the biographer. This is a book that returns Ginsberg to us once more - the rebel, the madman, the Good Samaritan and the poet.	2005-07-19

The first one is an X-Men/Alpha Flight story drawn by the legendary Paul Smith. The second one is an Art Adams classic New Mutants tale. The two stories both deal with Asgardians (chiefly the trickster god, Loki).<br /><br />As the usual Claremont formula is, the X-characters sit around their mansion (or Danger Room, or sunbathing at the beach, etc.) and they get attacked by a baddie (why can't anyone ever leave these poor muties alone?). In this case, the baddie is Loki. In the first story, he offers the X-Men a chance to build a utopia with a price. In the second story, he kidnaps Storm to be his bride and also teleports the New Mutants to Asgard (their experiences in Asgard forever changes them). For longtime readers, these stories were especially rewarding - we have the first announcement that Madelyne Pryor was pregnant (with baby Cable), the first meeting of Rachel Summers with Scott Summers, the \\"slimming-down\\" of Karma, Dani Moonstar's transformation into a Valkyrie, Rahne Sinclair's meeting with the Wolf-Prince of Asgard, another Wolverine-Snowbird meeting, and the tragic story of a well-intentioned Madelyne Pryor (as Anodyne) trying to save her team-mates.<br /><br />The moral of this story: Don't let false gods *bleep* with your lives. Especially if you're mutants!	2005-05-25

I love crossovers and super-long stories like \\"Knightfall\\", \\"No Man's Land\\", \\"Bruce Wayne: Murderer/Fugitive\\", etc. In fact, I disliked Jeph Loeb's and Jim Lee's \\"Hush\\" for breaking up the \\"rhythm\\" of the endless Bat-crossovers. \\"Hush\\", to me, felt too much like a ONE-SHOT story told in 12 parts - especially to appeal to non-fans. When \\"War Games\\" was announced, I was excited. I thought that it would be the story that will bring us back to the previous \\"Dennis O'Neil\\"-style of huge epics written to reward fans for their devotion to the tiny details of continuity. How did I feel after reading the first TPB collection, \\"Act One - Outbreak\\"? Nothing. I'm serious. In fact, I was surprised that I felt absolutely nothing. The style was right. It did look and feel like a Batman crossover should. But the story was so pointless and draggy. A huge crime-war story built upon something so flimsy and small - Spoiler's mistake. Overall, the whole thing came off very unemotional and empty. The issues by Devin Grayson and Ed Brubaker were bearable because they were a little more \\"old school\\" and they obviously cared for these characters. The others, by new-comers, were largely uninspiring and pointless. Bill Willingham's portrayal of Robin (Tim Drake) was especially annoying. Tim used to be such an interesting kid, the sidekick who is also there to watch after Batman's back when he gets too obsessive in his war-on-crime. Willingham made him a whiny and selfish young man. I'm hoping that the story improves with the next two acts (I don't know about the original single issues since I read TPBs most of the time these days).	2005-05-06
US	52496057	R1AH10NVQYPOI1	0399242570	35856191	Wormwood	Books	3	12	15	N	N	Interesting Religious Fantasy But....	\\"Wormwood\\" is the second novel from Graham Taylor (G.P. Taylor), following the success of his first novel, \\"Shadowmancer\\". If you've read \\"Shadowmancer\\", you'd probably look at this book as a \\"sequel of sorts\\". It's not strictly a sequel - the continuing bits are the \\"angelic\\" parts and the bits about Yezhina's brother. <br /> <br />As most of you already know by now, Taylor is actually a vicar of the Church of England and his books are very much patterned after the \\"religious fantasy\\" of authors like C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. By \\"religious fantasy\\", I think we should understand it as having a story primarily while reflecting the author's personal beliefs (unlike the more polemical or preachy \\"Left Behind\\" series). Taylor too stressed this in many interviews by outrightly denying that he's \\"writing a Christian book\\". For people like me, I'd consider that fortunate (for Taylor as well as his readers). Why do I say that? Well, to begin with, his theology is atrocious and terribly unorthodox in many ways. His characterization of angels are totally unbiblical and his good vs. evil themes are too Dualistic to be Christian (Dualistic struggles of good vs. evil - with good ultimately triumphing - makes good reading but lousy theology). <br /> <br />As for his story, I actually found it interesting enough to finish the book in two days. Some of the bits are truly scary and his depiction of magic and the quest for forbidden knowledge (a warning to esoteric-seekers and Kabbalists, perhaps?) are all very well presented. For the more widely read, you'll probably be able to trace his many influences to 17th-18th century occult movement in London (people like the Rosicrucians, Isaac Newton, Giordano Bruno and John Dee) as well as extra-Biblical literature like the Book of Enoch. The \\"Wormwood\\" comet in the story is, of course, a reference to the Book of Revelation. <br /> <br />My biggest gripe with his writing (apart from the atrocious theology) is his handling of characters. The characters do not appear \\"real\\" enough - they usually come off as uneven and sometime \\"manic\\", like mentioned by another reviewer here. Dr. Blake's supposed \\"conversion\\" after meeting Abram Rickards appeared very \\"forced\\". Agetta started as a strong character and ended up weepy and manic (Taylor attributes this to the evil influence of the Nemorensis). Apart from that, all of the characters are portrayed as selfish and manipulative (even the supposed good guys and good angels). In short, none of the characters are really \\"likable\\" at all! Finally, the \\"evil plot\\" of the fallen angel Hezrin is at best, very sketchy because we only get bits and pieces of it towards the end of the book - almost like Taylor was running out of pages already and he had to wrap up the book as fast as possible. <br /> <br />Good for a weekend's read but nothing very captivating. Some of the parts are quite scary and may not be suitable for younger children.	2005-04-16

Furthermore, what little he has to say, he says it with very little heart. This volume contains the story of Jean Grey's death. Try comparing it with the original \\"Death of Jean\\" in 1980 (see \\"Dark Phoenix Saga\\" TPB) and you'll see how much this one falls short. And to be honest, that's the most emotional scene in the book (in fact, it's the ONLY emotional scene in the book). Much like his other writings, Morrison's characters do not really talk - they spout clever one-liners. In fact, there's one part where the clever one-liners get so irritating that Magneto kills one mutant responsible for it. <br /> <br />As for the story, Xorn the mutant from the Chinese prison, is revealed to be Magneto all along. He trashes the Xavier Institute and much of NYC also. Wolverine and Jean is on Asteroid M and heading towards the sun. My favorite parts of the book are the scenes with Wolverine and Jean spending their final delirious moments together while awaiting their deaths. Apart from that, much of the story is centered on a drug-addicted, manic, posturing Magneto who attempts to overturn the world (literally!). There's a sense of Morrison trying too hard to outdo his earlier Cassandra Nova epic (which was far better plotted and scripted). The whole thing comes off very, very forced and largely \\"unreal\\" - almost like you're caught in a bad dream and all throughout you \\"know\\" that you're in a dream. (Of course, Morrison fans will probably praise him for the exact things that I'm criticizing him for here!!!). <br /> <br />All in all, it's not that I dislike this book. Far from it. It's still better than most stuff being published out there. But Ithink my appreciation of this volume has a lot to do with how much I like these characters rather than objectively concerning Morrison's writing quality. I, for one, enjoy Chris Claremont's \\"X-Treme X-Men\\" series a lot more.	2005-04-16
US	52496057	RA39STJ40GXOE	0785112308	449359480	X-Treme X-Men Volume 6: Intifada TPB	Books	4	6	6	N	N	More Mutant Politics From Claremont	Claremont's writing in the \\"X-Treme X-Men\\" series, though much maligned by the average Morrison-worshipping fan, is in actuality far more mature and deep than most comics out there (certainly far better, in my opinion, than even the often-praised Claremont stuff in the 1980s). Take this volume \\"Intifada\\" for example. Here we have Chris blowing our minds with his takes on the Mutant Politics of Valle Soleada, LA (a kind of fictitious take on the Israel-Palestinian conflict with the mutant residents and the baseline human residents). Ultimately, Claremont is trying to show that Xavier's pro-active X-Corps may actually be doing more harm than good. The peaceful coexistence of people in any land must be handled not by policies enforced by corporate/political bodies but by education and example (something exemplified by Rogue, Bishop and Cannonball in this storyline). However, the political factor also comes into play as policies are shaped by the people in power (and this is where Gambit and Storm comes in - they actually attend, in secret, a meeting of world leaders in Texas). <br /> <br />In comparison, I find that Morrison's \\"Riot At Xaviers\\" was loud and brash compared to this work by Claremont on the same theme but done a lot more subtly and with more heart. Morrison is very much like his league of worshippers at Barbelith.com - all cerebral-arrogance and very little heart. Claremont, on the other hand, tries to show us the difficulty of trying to apply the John-Ford-movies type of romantic-chivalry/heroism in a world controlled more by corporate/political policies (read: greed and pettiness) and the lack-of-love among people that threatens to destroy every ideal of unity/peace among us.  <br /> <br />Igor Kordey's art is surprisingly good in this one (far better than when he was working with Grant Morrison over at \\"New X-Men\\"). He draws this story of pain, racial hatred and injustice with much sensitivity and tenderness. In fact, it is the best that I've seen fromthis artist ever. <br /> <br />I knock off one star from my rating because for the entirety of this story, we never do get to see Rogue and Gambit together (despite the cover image). But we are duly compensated in the pairing of Cannonball-Lila Cheney and my favourite X-couple, Bishop and Sage.	2005-04-08

This is Claremont doing \\"mutant-politics\\". The result is Claremont's most insightful and poignant work ever. I think a lot of this is attributable to the fact that (when this story was written) Grant Morrison seemed to have usurped his throne as \\"Mr. X-Men\\". However, as a long time reader of the X-Men books, I think I share Claremont's views about Morrison's handling of the X-characters and the underlying concepts behind the whole thing. There is a lot to get excited about with Morrison's \\"X-Corp\\" and pro-active mutant-forces but it opens up a lot of controversial questions in \\"mutant politics\\". Here, you have Claremont writing in a very \\"interactive\\" style showing the Morrison characters (typified by Emma Frost, the White Queen) behaving totally in-character (like if Morrison were writing them) to debate with the Claremont characters (typified by Storm) on these same \\"political\\" issues. The end result is a work that examines the core of what the X-Men is really about and that Xavier's exuberance over his new pro-active techniques may be more dangerous than any enemy of humanity ever. Interestingly, Morrison's \\"Planet X\\" storyline seemed to be the realization of what Claremont feared would happen ultimately. I tip my hat off to Claremont's courage in taking on Morrison's philosophy square in the face in an intelligent way without resorting to appeals based on nostalgia. <br /> <br />Salvador Larroca's art continues to be very eye-pleasing and with the darker linework, they come off much clearer than in the previous two volumes. <br /> <br />The \\"X-Pose\\" storyline is another look at \\"mutant politics\\" - this time from the perspective of humans (or \\"baseline humans\\", a term that Claremont is using more and more) and the media. It is refreshing for old time readers like myself to see the return of old Claremont stalwarts like the two reporters from \\"The Fall ofthe Mutants\\" storyline and taking centerstage here.	2005-04-05

As with other books by members of the Jesus Seminar, Crossan is terribly narrow in his selection methods. This is, of course, done in order to fit the Jesus presented in the Canonical Gospels into the predefined mold of a social revolutionary that Crossan already established beforehand. The problem with this Jesus is that he is terribly unoffensive and uncontroversial - even for a social revolutionary who never claimed to be God-incarnate! Therefore, if this was what Jesus was like, it's hard to imagine why anyone would want to subject him to the worst forms of torture, humiliation and finally the violent death of crucifixion in the first place. In fact, if Crossan's Jesus was the real Jesus, the miracle would not be his supposed resurrection - it would be this: that people 2,000 years later would still be bothered to study the life of a totally uncontroversial wimp who is far less offensive than the average episode of \\"The Simpsons\\"! <br /> <br />Thankfully, Crossan's Jesus is NOT the real Jesus... and certainly not MY Jesus.	2005-03-31

First and foremost, the Jesus Seminar scholars do NOT represent the majority of Christian scholarship in our world today. More often than not, the scholars who make up the Jesus Seminar are the exceptions from the majority scholars - they are, in truth, the surviving vestige of the liberal scholarship from the previous century who have somehow decided to air their views in the public media. <br /> <br />Craig Blomberg, Scot McKnight, Darrell Bock, Edwin Yamauchi, Michael Wilkins and J.P. Moreland are representative of Christian scholars from different denominational/university background who examine in a very objective manner the methodologies to be employed in our present \\"search for the historical Jesus\\", the reliability of the New Testament writings, the place and purpose for scholarly conjectures/hypotheses, a survey of non-canonical writings like the Nag Hammadi writings and the Gnostic works, etc.  <br /> <br />The end result is a book that represents for our generation one of the finest defense of the works and words of Jesus as recorded in our Scriptures. It is my prayer that everyone who reads this book will go on from just merely asserting the truth of Jesus' words and works - and go on to study the content of the very same words and works. This will lead you to the truth about the PERSON and TRUTH of the Historical Jesus who is really no different from the Christ of Faith (historic Christianity) - \\"Jesus Christ, the Son of God\\" (Mark 1:1).	2005-03-31

We live in times wherein people prefer what \\"works\\" rather than what is true. Christianity, which is centered on Jesus Christ, is primarily a Body of Truth about Jesus Christ. However, we live in times wherein it's no longer enough to merely say that you believe in Jesus. The question really is \\"which Jesus\\"? <br /> <br />Recent scholarship have unearthed many writings like the Nag Hammadi writings and the Dead Sea Scrolls. While we celebrate the value of these archaeological findings, we have to at the same time be aware that many prejudiced opponents of the orthodox views of Jesus are actually using these writings as the basis to form all sorts of quirky theories that supposedly substitutes the true Jesus with a Gnostic Christ. Groothuis examines the origins of many of the modern Gnostic (or revived-Gnostic) ideas and compares them objectively against the historic documents of the Christian church, namely the canonical Gospels and the Epistles. Arguments from both sides are subjected to the acid-test of veracity, reliability and historicity. I highly recommend a careful study of these chapters in the book for anyone facing challenges in these areas (for example, through the propagation of the same ideas in novels such as \\"DaVinci Code\\", etc.) <br /> <br />In addition to the \\"documentary\\" and Gnostic challenges to orthodox faith, Groothuis also examines other sub-movements and cultic views presenting an Eastern-Mystic Jesus, a channelled Jesus, a sorcerous Jesus and ultimately the Jesus of the New Age movement who is merely a man with a heightened sense of the Divine in himself (and who came to tell us to realize the same divinity in ourselves).  <br /> <br />Jesus Christ is still the central figure of our existence. In the past, He confronted the disciples on Caesarea Phillipi with the question - \\"Who do people say that I am?\\" This book introduces us to some of the quirky ideas that people today say about Jesus. But ultimately, the question that each and every one of us MUST answer is this: \\"Who do YOU say that I am?\\"	2005-03-31

Great story and great art plus the return of Kara Zor-El (something I've been waiting for about TWENTY YEARS since weeping over the death of Supergirl in the late eighties). What are you waiting for?

The story is simple superhero fare with lots of heart. If you're sick of all those \\"decompressed\\" writing over at Marvel where the hero is unmasked and sits down moping for five issues in a cafe before putting in the mask again to punch the villain on the sixth issue (and the 6 issues should fit nicely into a TPB collection), you'll absolutely LOVE this volume.

Gresham Machen and the Crisis of Conservative Protestantism in Modern America	Books	4	18	18	N	N	Time Was When Religion Was Serious And Intellectual	J. Gresham Machen is one of the most maligned men in Christian history. Most accounts I know present him as a bad-attitude, polemical and intolerant religious bigot. Here, D.G. Hart presents the man in a very sober and objective manner - correctly placing him within the socio-political-religious background of his day. Thus, we come to a much better appreciation of the man and his views. Additional insights into his family life and one-time-possible-romance adds colour to the typically sombre portrayal of the man. In fact, sombre isn't the word that I would ever use to describe Machen after reading this book. Machen was known chiefly among his students as one of warmest and most humourous lecturers at Princeton while at the same time truly uncompromising in his belief that the Christian faith owes its origin to God Almighty in Christ Jesus. Finally, I think the greatest contribution of the book is that Hart here presents a Machen who was as much opposed to \\"brain-dead\\" Fundamentalist who preached \\"easy-believism\\" as he was the Modernists/Liberals. With this book, we finally get a Machen who was a Churchman, Scholar and \\"Mr-Valiant-For-Truth\\". Oh, for more like him in our decadent times.	2005-02-28

Therein lies the problem with a lot of \\"greatest hits\\" style of storytelling in today's comics (e.g. Whedon's \\"X-Men\\", Millar's \\"Spider-Man\\" and Loeb-Lee's \\"Batman:Hush\\"). With JSA however, the writing team of Geoff Johns and David Goyer delivers month after month. In music terms, they feel like the Beatles or Led Zep during their heydays. Every new album is an attempt to top the previous one - while maintaining an obvious intelligence, growth and direction with the constant move forward. This is how I feel everytime I pick up a new TPB collection of JSA. Regular artists Leonard Kirk and Keith Champagne takes over the chores from the previous artists Steve Sadowski and Rags Morales very well - the style is similar and the action is no less blockbusting. <br /> <br />As with ongoing stories, there are times when things are quieter. This volume \\"Savage Times\\" is one of those times. It sets up the events to come in the next two epic storylines \\"Princes of Darkness\\" and \\"Black Reign\\". However, with the JSA, \\"quieter\\" doesn't mean uneventful. And this is why I come back again and again to this book - in contrast to the \\"talking heads\\" attempts of decompressed-writing over at Marvel (see anything by Brian Bendis for example). This is what comic books should be - action-oriented, fun, melodramatic and above all, superbly entertaining. Here, we get a time-travel story back to 1944 (the Freedom Force and Mr. Terrific appears) and ancient Egypt. This story wraps up a lot of things originally set up previously and successfully sets up new things for the future (the cliffhanger ending of this volume guarantees that you WILL want to get the next volume). <br /> <br />Another reason to get this volume is the focus on Captain Marvel (the \\"Shazam\\" guy). This storyarc fleshes him out in many ways and takes him way beyond the \\"cartoonish\\" feel that he's always been portrayed. We also get additional light shed on Black Adam (Theo-Adam) never before seen. This adds a lot of meat to his once over-simplified \\"villain\\" character and also forces the reader to symphatize with his methods and ideals (a lot of which will result in the explosive \\"Black Reign\\" saga to come).	2005-02-28

There is an obvious love for the imaginative, dream-like and child-like stories of heroism from the Silver Age in all of Waid's writings. That's the reason Grant Morrison credits Waid for ending the all-pervasive grim-and-gritty mood that dominated comics since the mid-1980s. \\"Kingdom Come\\" (and \\"The Kingdom\\") is very much the last word on the Silver Age. In \\"JLA: Year One\\" and \\"The Brave and the Bold\\", Waid takes us back to the Silver Age to revisit that era one more time and to be inspired once more by the heroic spirit of John Broome and Gardner Fox one more time. And if you're looking for more of that here in \\"Superman: Birthright\\", you'll be sorely disappointed... <br /> <br />Waid does with \\"Birthright\\" in 2003/4 what Frank Miller did with \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" in 1986. It's a statement about an icon to fit the times. And we all know that Silver Age is really in the past. We live in different times altogether. Miller told us that in the late 1980s. Waid is trying to do that for today. I can't read \\"Dark Knight\\" these days without a backward glance to 1986. In the same way, I think future readers will say that \\"Birthright\\" is really a product of the early 21st century, the post-9/11 world of camera-phones and real-time news media.  <br /> <br />Therefore, like Miller's \\"Dark Knight\\" it shares many of its strengths - \\"Birthright\\" attempts to be the DEFINITIVE statement on \\"who Superman is and why he does what he does\\". The whole thing reads like a philosophical inquiry into the Superman-mythos and is much like an amalgamation of everything that makes Superman great (from the Siegel/Shuster activist to the Fleischer animated champion of humanity to the Mort Weisinger sci-fi Kryptonian to Christopher Reeve and, of course John Byrne's \\"Man of Steel\\" and the current \\"Smallville\\").  <br /> <br />However, the book also share many of the flaws of \\"Dark Knight\\" - it comes off more as a definitive VERSION of the character than a true representation of the timelessness of the original myth. Like I said in the above, \\"Dark Knight\\" is so '80s and in the same way, this work is sooooo 2003/4! Also, there is also the feeling that \\"Birthright\\" at times tries too hard to be great - even at the expanse of the story! <br /> <br />All in all, despite its flaws, the work is noteworthy for its sharper redefinition of the young Superman trying to find his place in the universe (for can \\"our\\" world, whether it be Smallville or Metropolis, truly contain him?). It gives us a Kal-El who honors his Kryptonian heritage as much as it gives us a Clark Kent who believes in his Smallville upbringing. Much has been made about how Waid ignores established continuity as well as accusations of trying to plagiarise the \\"Smallville\\" Lex Luthor. My opinion? Sometimes a comic work comes along that's so big that it transcends \\"smaller\\" (I say that as a continuity-freak myself) things like \\"continuity\\". After all, the Superman myth is more than the comics. Heck, it's more than the movies and action figures and TV shows. It's pop-culture. It's mythology-for-the-masses. It's truth-and-justice-and-humor-and-romance. It's science fiction and the world of tomorrow. And you'll find it all here in \\"Superman: Birthright\\".	2005-01-06

Having read the excellent \\"Wonder Woman: Hiketeia\\" by Greg Rucka, I was feverishly anticipating the beginning of his run on the regular \\"Wonder Woman\\" comics. This volume collects the first six issues (195-200) of his monthly WW comics and while very different in tone and scope from \\"Hiketeia\\", it certainly does not disappoint.    Greg Rucka is what I'd call a very \\"serious\\" and \\"focused\\" writer. Reading this volume, one can see that he's setting up for some big things here. In fact, my only complaint about the man's writing is that he's seriously lacking a sense of humor - something that can be quite detrimental to a \\"comic\\" book writer! But then, that also means that we are spared the many self-deferential humor that is dominating many other books at the moment. In fact, one can easily see the seriousness and passion Rucka brings to Wonder Woman in just these short issues. Wondy becomes a woman of intelligence and heart - you tend to overlook the skimpy costume when she starts talking about \\"real-world\\" issues like equality, tolerance, sexuality, religion, etc. Rucka is also building a new group of supporting characters with this volume - mostly people who work with Wondy at the Themyscriran Embassy (including the kitchen-help!).    As for the story, I feel that Rucka is being deliberately \\"political\\". This is very apt for a character like Wonder Woman, who was originally meant to represent socio-political ideas in the 1940s by her original creators (William Moulton Marston and H.G. Peters). What we see here, however, is an update on the \\"political issues\\" that Wonder Woman is representing today. The story begins with Wondy publising a book of essays and speeches called \\"Reflections\\" and all of a sudden, she becomes the new Bertrand Russell. In other words, she starts getting followings and cult groups - and also offending quite a lot of other people who disagrees with her ideas on sexuality (Themysciracn lesbianism), religion (Greek paganism) and capital punishment. Here, we see the supporting characters really getting to work as her P.R. agents, as her public defenders, etc. The whole things comes off feeling like \\"The West Wing\\" meets Classical Greek mythology. But it works!    Speaking of the Greek myths, this volume also sees an \\"update\\" on the Greek pantheon. We live in a post-modern world where ancient gods either learn to keep up with the times or they grow obsolete and are forgotten. The most interesting of the updates here is, of course, the War God Ares (Mars), who comes off as very post-modern and devious - somewhat like Mike Carey's \\"Lucifer\\". As for other villains, we have Zeus (at least, I think Rucka is setting him up to be a problem to the Amazons), Doctor Psycho, some women (Veronica Cale and Leslie Anderson) and the return of the Silver Swan.     Finally, the art. The art is what makes this work a gem. Even if you don't like Rucka's take on this book, you'll love it for the art. Everything from the gorgeous covers by Adam Hughes, Greg Land and J.G. Jones to the interior art by new-comer Drew Johnson simply shines. Johnson gives us a lovely Diana who comes off as beautiful and intelligent - thus, perfectly complementing Rucka's envisionng of the character. However, my favourite piece of art inside is the \\"Norman Rockwell\\" painting of Diana in the park by Steve Rude. Lastly, Eric Shanower (who is doing excellent work with Greek stuff in his own \\"Age of Bronze\\" series) contributes some pieces at the back of the book as \\"press releases\\" covering the release of Diana's book of essays.    There's so much to like and enjoy in this package. What are you waiting for? Get this book today!	2004-08-09

However, this volume (\\"Lifelines\\") is a vast improvement over the previous volume. Firstly, the layouts are so much clearer and Byrne's inking (that was quite shoddy in the previous volume) sees great improvement here. Secondly, Byrne is trying to be Byrne here. He's not trying to out-write George Perez and neither is he trying to be a clone of other writers. Byrne is best when he is giving us straight-forward comic-book fun. And that's what you'll find in this volume - fun comics with a touch of the \\"Silver-Age\\" feel.<br />Guest-stars include Etrigan the Demon, the Phantom Stranger, Barry Allen (a clone), Sinestro (another clone) and Doomsday (the final clone). Superman plants a tree and drops by Gateway City but never did meet up with Wonder Woman! Hey, that's not a complain - it's always nice to see Byrne draw Supes again. Overall, nothing very deep or splashy here. Just pure comic-book fun!	2004-07-15

Firstly, I've heard a lot of complains about John Byrne's work on \\"Wonder Woman\\". Secondly, I've just read the bulk of George Perez's and Phil Jimenez's work on the Amazing Amazon and therefore, I consider myself a new fan - I can't bear the disillusionment should I come to hate her portrayal by Byrne. However being the completist that I am, I finally did. Here's what I think...<br />\\"Second Genesis\\" collects the first five issues of Byrne's tenure as plotter, scripter, penciller, inker and letterer of Wonder Woman. Yes, you read that right. This guy does it all himself. Only the coloring is done by someone else (in this case, the ultra-talented Patricia Mulvihill). And herein lies the problem. Byrne is no Eisner or Kirby but he sure tries hard! The end result is a little mixed. The work here is neither very bad but neither are they very good. I think many would agree with me that Byrne's best work were those in the past - X-Men, Superman and even She-Hulk.<br />The story: Diana moves to Gateway City and becomes a superhero there - much like all the other superheroic-guardians-of-fictional-cities that populate the DC Universe. This is clearly a move away from the more mythological-heavy tone of George Perez's recreation in 1987. While I love Perez's work, I wouldn't say that a change is necessarily bad. In fact, I'd say that the second half of Perez's run on the book was a little too slow-moving and often concentrated more on the book's supporting characters (Inspector Indelicato, Julia Kapatelis, Vanessa Kapatelis, Eileen, Lucy, and the countless Amazons like Menalippe, Phytia, Iphtime, etc. etc.) than on the title-character herself. And that's one thing that has been corrected by Byrne here. Diana takes centerstage in this story in a glorious fashion. And that's all I have to praise about Byrne's approach - it's good to see Diana on nearly every page and panel. The rest are all complains:<br />1) Darkseid's attackon Themyscira seems forced and his exit seems to abrupt. The whole thing felt a little pointless. I don't know whether this particular plotline is followed up upon much in the preceding issues (having never read them), but in this book alone, the reader is left feeling like there's no point to the whole thing. I mean, Darkseid murders 1,200+ Amazons and he just leaves? Where's the resolution to that?<br />2) I don't really like Diana's costume redesign. Byrne switched the star-spangled panties (?!?) with another pair that has only two stars in the front. Then he gave her a belt that is so big that it needed to be tucked into her golden WW bra! Yes, it really is like that - see for yourself!<br />3) Byrne's art almost always suffer when he inks them himself. DC should have hired another inker like Terry Austin or Brett Breeding and this work would've turned out better. In many panels, Diana looks too skinny and haggard. There is a difference between battle-worn and downright shoddy. <br />4) The new supporting characters introduced here are too similar to Perez's that you feel like Byrne is \\"redoing\\" Perez. Cassie and her professor mother is very much like Vanessa and Julia Kapatelis. Detective Mike Schorr is just another version of Officer Indelicato!<br />5) The foreword by Byrne himself is quite painful to read. And I'm saying that as a Byrne-fan myself for many years! You see, I buy this book primarily for a Wonder Woman story. And the foreword is really about \\"Let-Me-Tell-You-The-Epic-Story-Of-How-DC-Finally-Got-ME-To-Work-On-Wonder-Woman!\\" I find that quite laughable. Byrne is a comicbook writer/artist. What else would he be doing if not comicbooks? Wonder Woman is just another job - not an epic undertaking by any great stretch! But the way he described his taking the job was like it had to do with the fates being aligned and that it's got some cosmic significance. Seriously, I don't think even Leo Tolstoy would be saying this if he's been picked to do the book!<br />This book is recommended only for Wonder Woman completists and DC historians. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to someone that I'd like to introduce to the character.	2004-07-12

I got both volumes of Phil Jimenez's &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; stories on the same day and read them back to back. After that I had to lie down for three days. The work here in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and in the second volume, &quot;Paradise Found&quot;, is a feast for the eyes. You'll spend days gazing into the details of each panel that you'll literally suffer from sensory overload after that. That wasn't a complain. In fact, I absolutely LOVE Jimenez's art in this book. He's the closest thing to having George Perez draw this book again (and in many ways, Jiminez's art is even better). We live in a time where big-panels and in-your-face, action-oriented splash pages are the norm. In fact, I'm one of those who complain about how expensive comicbooks are and how short a time it takes to read one these days. Not so with Jimenez. His &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; takes *forever* to read. There's just so much to savour in his 12-16 panels-per-page comics.<br />This first volume contains three storyarcs. The first has the return of Ares' children to Earth - this time taking over the bodies of Poison Ivy, Scarecrow and Joker. The Wonder-Woman-Family and the Bat-Family team up to take them down. <br />The second story is a civil-war, politically-heavy story that finally ties-up all the long-standing issues from George Perez's previous run on the title. Phil Jimenez successfully balances the &quot;super-heroic&quot; Byrne version of Wonder Woman with the myth/politics-heavy Perez version in these stories. We finally see the resolution to the whole Themyscrican/Bana-Mighdall conflict. (There's also a short insert featuring a more streamlined origin of Donna Troy that served as a kind of Prologue to this arc.)<br />The third story is the best of the bunch. It features a day in the life of Diana, as chronicled by Lois Lane. Joe Kelly co-writes this tale and brings much-needed &quot;humanity&quot; to our beloved Amazon. <br />Despite the whole story being rather &quot;continuity-heavy&quot;, I'd still recommend this book to a new reader. The beauty and obvious passion of the work is enough to suck anyone in.	2004-07-12

Winick understands the challenge of writing someone like Ollie and in my opinion, he's doing a fine job with his first outing. We have a story of Ollie going up against a &quot;fat-cat&quot; corrupt corporation in Star City, flirting with a young lawyer, stuggling with his doubts and childishness and finally the introduction of a scary villain in Drakon (a first step in creating a &quot;rogues gallery&quot; for Ollie).<br />&quot;Straight Shooter&quot; shows a lot of promise by the new creative team. I'm looking forward to future volumes by Winick and gang.	2004-06-23

This volume continues from the previous one, \\"A Darker Shade of Justice\\" and it collects issues 41-45 of the monthly Nightwing and the two issues of Birds of Prey that it crosses-over with.<br />Chuck Dixon continues his excellent storytelling and characterization-work here. Nightwing (Dick Grayson) returns to Bludhaven after the events of \\"No Man's Land\\" in Gotham City. He takes his finals and graduates as a police officer. Meanwhile, the subplots from the previous volumes involving Tad (Nite-Wing) builds to a new level of intensity and violence in this volume as Nightwing attempts to take him under his tutelage. Also, new developments in the relationship of Dick and Clancy. Finally, there is the introduction of a new element into the Bludhaven police force (MacArnot) who may be a sleazier cop than even the legendary Dudley Soames was. For those who have been diligently following Chuck Dixon's developing plot-lines, the rewards of this volume are numerous. If like me, you like the soap-opera aspects of a monthly superhero comic where the characters grow, you'll love what Dixon is doing here.<br />Then we move on to the main plot. Blockbuster, the \\"kingpin\\" of Bludhaven wants to hunt down Oracle (Barbara Gordon, the former Batgirl and Dick's girlfriend). And he does that by torturing Nightwing for information and by hiring a whole group of thugs/assassins. Oracle's partner, Black Canary, races against time around the globe to save her. This story also provides the biggest pay-out in the relationship of the \\"Birds of Prey\\" (Oracle and Canary) since the series began.<br />My only complain here is that the book seems to end on a cliffhanger (that I believe doesn't continue in the \\"Nightwing\\" books but are carried over into the \\"Birds of Prey\\" book instead). But then, such are the stuff that crossovers are made of. All in all, the story has so much to offer already that you'll overlook that.<br />Lastly, this volume also sees the debut of Greg Land as the new penciller for \\"Nightwing\\"; taking over from Scott McDaniel, who moved on to draw \\"Batman\\". While I absolutely love the dynamism and crazy action of McDaniel's art after the last four books, I have to admit that Greg Land is no slouch either. While he lacks the kinetic energy of McDaniel, Land more than makes up for that in his beautiful, clean line-work and absolutely gorgeous figure-drawing. For those of us who've followed Greg Land's art since the original \\"Nighwing\\" miniseries, you'll be pleased to see how much the man has evolved and improved here (and also in the CrossGen book, \\"Sojourn\\"). On a personal note, I prefer Drew Geraci inking over Land's pencils than Jose Marzan Jr. (who is far better when he's inking over Stuart Immonen). Both inkers strut their stuff in this volume so you can make your own comparisons. Patrick Zircher helps Land out as co-penciller and Butch Guice draws the \\"Birds of Prey\\" issues. The art in this book is pure eye-candy and this book is worth the price of admission on that alone.	2004-06-13

I was introduced to this book by many Christian leaders from my local church many years back. Many Christian leaders and publications continue to advocate the reading of this book and the application of the principles in it. With this &quot;20th Anniversary Edition&quot;, this book has been elevated to a &quot;Classic&quot; status among modern Christian works.<br />Granted, every generation of Christians are reminded by sincere, Bible-believing folks to seek the &quot;deeper Christian life&quot;. Richard Forter's &quot;Celebration of Discipline&quot; seeks to meet that need by reexamining Christian practices and reapplying them to the needs and contexts of the modern Christian. However, Foster's theology seems suspect when he starts talking about the practice of &quot;confession&quot; and &quot;meditation&quot; (that smacks of idolatrous vain-imaginings and very un-Christian hallucinatory &quot;mind-trips&quot; - Foster goes to the extent of even recommending the &quot;Lotus-position&quot; for meditation!).<br />All in all, a Christian's deeper-life is in his daily walk with God. It's in the surrendering of self to Christ and in putting on the whole armour of God (Ephesians 6). Application of pseudo-spiritual &quot;disciplines&quot; does little to help a growing Christian; and in fact encourages a feeling of &quot;spiritual superiority&quot; that the Bible clearly warn us to stay away from. Christianity is not about formulaes and ritualistic, pseuso-spirituality. The true discipline of being Christian is genuine pursuit of holiness and practice of godliness.<br />I recommend the works of A.W. Tozer (&quot;Pursuit of God&quot;, &quot;Knowledge of the Holy&quot;, &quot;The Divine Conquest&quot;, &quot;Root of the Righteous&quot;, etc.) and even Jerry Bridges (&quot;Pursuit of Holiness&quot; and &quot;Practice of Godliness&quot;) in place of this work. Also, check out Dave Hunt's &quot;Seduction of Christianity&quot; and &quot;Beyond Seduction&quot; for a closer examination of some of the dangerous ideas presented in this book (and in other works by many &quot;popular&quot; teachers today).ation of some of the dangerous ideas presented in this book (and in other works by many &quot;popular&quot; teachers today).	2004-06-13

Over the years, I have read many tomes of systematic theology, dogmatics, etc. In fact, I'd thought that I long &quot;out-grew&quot; these &quot;Beginner&quot; books on the Christian faith. Then my wife bought a new edition that contains both books and I read them through again over the weekend. I was pleasantly surprised by the masterful simplicity in Little's presentation of the core truths of Christianity in such a clear, intelligent manner; yet without trivialising the whole thing with needlessly casual anecdotes or the feeling like he's &quot;talking down to you&quot;. As a young Christian, I got the feeling that these books were simple apologetics that one used for evangelism and discipleship. On rereading them this round, I found them to be very scholarly works but presented in a very readable format (and believe me, that's quite a feat!). For me on a personal level, it's a return to the basics, the core truths - the vital stuff that makes Christianity so amazing and meaningful in the first place. <br />These two books are modern Christian classics and should be on every Christian's bookshelf. Buy a dozen today and start rereading them and giving them out.	2004-06-13

Chuck Dixon and Jim Balent is at their collaborative best in this volume, \\"Catwoman: The Catfile\\". Overall, the story is pretty thin but somehow the charm, pacing, breathless action and fantastic art draws you in. The whole thing reads like a summer blockbuster on paper and Balent's drawing of a super-sexy, super-spy-with-an-attitude feels almost like a guilty pleasure.<br />Recommended for all Hong Kong action movie buffs, Catwoman fans who hate the Halle Berry movie and everyone who loves a fast-moving, entertaining comicbook. In recent years, comicbooks seem to be struggling for \\"recognition\\" by the \\"real world\\". It tries to appear \\"literary\\", \\"complex\\" and \\"mature\\". Even the movie-adaptations try to do that by amplifying themes such as parent-child trauma (e.g. Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\" and Sam Raimi's \\"Spiderman\\"). In actual fact, a comicbook is primarily about fun. And if, like me, you miss the honest-to-goodness FUN of reading a comicbook, well, this book has it in spades!	2004-06-08

Chuck Dixon's run on the monthly \\"Nightwing\\" books with artists Scott McDaniel and Karl Story are among the best runs by a creative team ever. The trio created a likable lead character in the former Boy-Wonder, Dick Grayson, and placed him in a town-without-pity, Bludhaven. With this volume (the fourth in the Nightwing series by the trio), Nightwing truly steps out of the shadow of his mentor, Batman, and becomes his own man. This is the volume that has everything and more to satisfy even the most demanding comic fan. Examples?<br />1] A team-up with Superman that shows how deep the bond is that Dick shares with Supes. Remember that Dick was part of the \\"World's Finest\\" team in the Silver Age? (People always remember that team as a Batman-Superman team only!) Furthermore, in the Silver Age, Superman takes on the name \\"Nightwing\\" sometimes when he visits the Bottled City of Kandor. In this volume (set in post-Crisis continuity), we have Superman telling Nightwing the exploits of a \\"Kryptonian\\" hero called \\"Nightwing\\"! Also, see Superman take on the \\"kingpin\\" of Bludhaven, the Blockbuster.<br />2] Nightwing in the No Man's Land! See how Dick fights to bring order to Blackgate Prison. There's more action here than in all five \\"Batman: No Man's Land\\" tradepaperbacks combined! See how Chuck Dixon silence all the cynics and critics calling this book \\"Batman Jr.\\" or \\"Batman Lite\\" once and for all with this pulse-pounding tale. Dick Grayson is indeed his own man now, no less than his mentor.<br />3] The kiss that seals a great love. In the Silver Age stories, we see Batgirl (Barbara Gordon) flirting many times with Robin, without it coming to any finality. Then by the 1970s-90s, Nightwing was primarily featured only in Marv Wolfman's \\"New Teen Titans\\" books (there, he was paired with the alien Starfire). In this volume, Chuck Dixon revives the Barbara-Dick romance with them finally expressing their love for each other. All in the midst of a life-and-death team-up against the mad, fanatical ex-GCPD cops.<br />4] This volume also sets up the brilliant storyline that is further expanded upon in future volumes - Dick Grayson as a police officer!<br />Lastly, I'd like to say that Scott McDaniel used to be my most hated artist at one time. Now, I can't get enough of the crazy perspectives and unbelievably \\"messy\\" details in his art. If you want comic-artwork that screams \\"action\\" and drives your adrenaline level all the way up, there's nothing comparable to the McDaniel-Story team.	2004-06-08

Comics wanted to erase from memory but it somehow surfaces every now and then. \\"Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper\\" is actually \\"Catwoman: Year One\\" (or the closest we will ever get to a \\"Year One\\" for the feline fatale) as it ties in very closely to Frank Miller's justly-classic \\"Batman: Year One\\". In fact, it more than \\"ties-into\\" that work; entire scenes were lifted from Miller's original and put into this volume. In fact, the present writer/artist seem to have created their story in this volume by wrapping some \\"filler-info\\" around those famous Miller-scenes.<br />As to the notoriety of the work, this volume, like Miller's \\"Batman: Year One\\" gives us a Selina Kyle who works as a prostiture/sexual-dominatrix. But more than that, it ties her to religion (Selina's sister is a Catholic nun) and child-prostitution/abuse in the character of Holly. Furthermore, this tale revives the classic sexual attraction between Batman and Catwoman with a classic kiss shared by the two on the rooftop (a scene stolen by Tim Burton and added to the movie, \\"Batman Returns\\"). <br />According to DC Editorial decrees, this work is no longer part of official continuity (after the continuity altering event called \\"Zero Hour\\"). However, DC continuity is a tricky thing and so are Editorial decrees. In recent years, it seems to be back in \\"official continuity\\" as the current Ed Brubaker \\"Catwoman\\" series seems like a direct continuation of this book (Holly and Selina's sister features prominently in Brubaker's run). Therefore, it is an essential read in Catwoman's long legend.<br />Continuity aside, this is really a difficult book to like. The art is choppy at times, and the scenes \\"lifted\\" from Miller's work (originally drawn by David Mazzuchelli) does not help either. In truth, it only adds to the frustration that this work wasn't done by the original Miller-Mazzuchelli team! About the only element in this tale that is half-decent is the introduction of Ted Grant (the Golden Age JSA-er, Wildcat) as Selina Kyle's mentor. The writing is very, very uneven and the pacing is hopeless. Reading it again recently, I felt like I was watching a bootleg, unedited David Lynch movie. After a while, I gave up on the pacing and tried to make as much sense of the story as possible. Honestly, if not for my great love for the characters (Batman and Catwoman), I'd probably give up by the first chapter.<br />My copy is an original first-print tradepaperback with the original painted cover and an excellent foreword by the late Archie Goodwin. Goodwin compares Catwoman to the movie \\"Cat People\\" and talks a little about sexual repression and the need for split-personas. Interesting stuff.<br />This volume is recommended to all Batman/Catwoman historians as well as the new fans just getting in with the Ed Brubaker monthly. It is also recommended as an antidote to purge the poison of the new Warner Bros. \\"Catwoman\\" movie starring Halle Berry. The real Catwoman is in here; NOT in that movie!	2004-06-08

In fact, it was the book that introduced me to the fascinating world of DC Comics' &quot;Golden Age&quot; and its colourful characters. I was genuinely distressed when it ended some years back (and I'm not alone, check out the reviews on the many &quot;Starman&quot; TPBs to see that). Therefore, I am genuinely thankful that James Robinson is continuing his magic (with Geoff Johns, another of my favourite writers) on the newly revived &quot;Hawkman&quot; title.<br />While the first volume (&quot;Endless Flight&quot;) helped to introduce us to the characters and the city of St. Roch, this second volume is where the book actually takes flight. Those who loved &quot;Starman&quot; for its many &quot;Times Past&quot; storyline will be pleased to know that the same thing is happening here in &quot;Hawkman&quot; with its &quot;Lives Past&quot; (the first of which is reprinted here with Hawkman/Hawkgirl in the old West). This volume also reintroduced the &quot;Gentleman Ghost&quot; Jim Craddock, a Golden Age villain who bears comparison to the great character of The Shade in &quot;Starman&quot;. All in all, like &quot;Starman&quot;, we again have a book that is truly modern and yet is rooted in history - paying homage to the work of &quot;Times Past&quot;.<br />Further bonus: The Atom guest stars in this book, Hawkgirl discovers the truth behind her parents' murder and we see some real developments in the relationship between Hawkman and Hawkgirl. Finally, the whole package is presented to us by the breath-takingly beautiful art of Rags Morales (inked by Michael Bair) and Don Kramer. The equally gorgeous painted covers by Andrew Robinson and John Watson are included in the back of the book.<br />This book is heartily recommended to everyone who loves the romance, chivalry and rich history of superhero comics.	2004-06-05

Warren Ellis is often touted as the heir of the Moore-Morrison-Gaiman throne as the new king of &quot;mature&quot; comic-book writing. Reading his &quot;Planetary&quot; comic, I have to disagree. And I'm not the only one. Check out some of the discussions going on at the Barbelith forum to see what I mean. Ellis comes from the cynical British fraternity of comic-book writers who think they are so far above &quot;mere superhero-spandex books&quot; but since the majority of American comics are in the category of the aforementioned &quot;superhero-spandex&quot; type, they are forced (reluctantly and with much disdain) to write within that genre. I'm not making this up. Ellis himself admitted to this in countless interviews and articles.<br />Therefore, Ellis had to struggle to acquaint himself with this whole mumbo-jumbo of the superhero esoterica. And to him, it's all about archetypes and formulaes (Batman as the Dark Avenger, Superman as the Christ-like icon, etc.) Having stripped the superhero myth down to its bare bones, Ellis attempts to write a story around them. Therefore, he introduce us to Elijah Snow, Jakita Wagner and The Drummer in &quot;Planetary&quot;. Three &quot;mystery archaeologist&quot; who set out to figure out the whole superhero esoterica. In this first volume, we have an examination of the pulp-heroes of the 1920s/30s, we visit Japan for a look at the inspiration behind its famed monster movies (e.g. &quot;Godzilla&quot;) and finally, we end up in Hong Kong for a John-Woo-type balladic bullets work.<br />The whole thing is very interesting but ultimately comes off as just a clever, deconstructionist piece of meta-fiction but not much more. It's ultimately very empty. It's almost like a writer who's not really trying hard enough to write a good superhero story so he deconstruct others' works into mere formulaes. In addition to all that, Ellis presents the whole thing from a very cynical mode through the three very obnoxiously unlikable main characters. That's &quot;Planetary&quot;. Clever, pretentious and empty. I gave the book two stars mainly because of the fantastic art of John Cassady.<br />In closing, I'd like to say something about superhero comics. It's not just formulaes and archetypes. I mean, you can deconstruct anything, any genre, that way and then go off to brag that you've mastered the whole thing. Superhero comics is the great American myth and its characters have been with us for decades. Clark Kent, Bruce Wayne, Peter Parker, Alan Scott, Hal Jordan, Barry Allen, etc. It's about the romance of chivalry. It's about the soap-opera of relationships and loves. It's about values and people who still believe in them. I'm thankful that it's far richer than the insipid stuff presented by a self-proclaimed know-it-all like Warren Ellis.	2004-06-05

Here's another offering from the kings of retro, Jeph Loeb (writer) and Tim Sale (artist), reexamining Batman during his mythical \\"Year One\\" period. If you believe the intro to this volume, this story was meant to be a sequel to Frank Miller's classic retelling of the Dark Knight's early days in \\"Batman: Year One\\" (1986/7). As a story, this work is pretty weak in many areas; as a sequel, is simply falls short of the tight, mature storytelling of Frank Miller's original.<br />The story centers on the Roman family (originally introduced in \\"Batman: Year One\\"), a serial killer who offs people in creative ways during holiday seasons and the trio out to stop the crimes - Batman, Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. Tim Sale is especially suitable for a work like this - his moody, atmospheric and splash-pages art are truly a sight to behold. You feel yourself being sucked into Batman's Gotham. My primary complaint is with Jeph Loeb's writing. Like my previous review of \\"Superman for All Seasons\\", my views of the man's writing hasn't changed. I like HOW he writes - I just dislike WHAT he writes! He's a great scripter, providing witty, timely and simply apt dialogues and caption boxes that the whole thing read very smoothly even though it runs into 300+ pages. The problem is with his insipid plotting. He should have someone else plot his tales and script over them. For example, in order to maintain the novelty of \\"holiday-themed killings\\", the story is stretched across THIRTEEN months and countless murders - and finally Batman catches the killer (but we are told that he got the wrong guy). And this is the \\"World's Greatest Detective\\"? Meanwhile, Batman consults a Hannibal-Lecter-like Calendar Man who is incapacitated in prison but seemingly knows the identity of the killer (?!?). See the problem? Batman, Gordon and Harvey are supposedly super-cops and they run around like madmen without a clue to the killer and you have this locked-up guy knowing the truth behind everything? Granted, Loeb was trying to set up a \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" scene with Calendar Man but therein lies the weakness of the whole thing. It is a scene set up for its own sake and doesn't contribute anything to the STORY. We live in times wherein comic writers are a lot more influenced by TV and movies than literature. And Loeb, former screenwriter, epitomize this new breed of writers who set up cool scenes, writes clever dialogue, provides the atmosphere with the right artistic collaboration but ultimately delivers something very hollow and shallow. \\"The Long Halloween\\" is often compared to the pulp classics of Chandler and Hammett. I disagree vehemently. Loeb and Sale gave us \\"mood\\" and \\"cool scenes\\" but ultimately the story is without gusto, the characters lack the machismo and grit of true noirish anti-heroes, and though the atmosphere is there, it lacks the tight, all-encompassing claustrophobia of the great noirish works. <br />The only redeeming factor in this work is the retelling of Two-Face's origin. Loeb is especially great in the quiet \\"character\\" moments and here, the tragic story of Harvey Dent's transformation into Two-Face is beautifully retold. But Loeb's strength is often his most-glaring fault at the same time. For example the book begins with a full-page drawing of a grim-looking Bruce Wayne muttering, \\"I believe in Gotham City\\" - a scene I found to be laughably out-of-character for the flamboyant playboy persona of Bruce Wayne! This kinds of out-of-character scenes abound throughout the story. All in all, this story should have been better written by a more gritty writer like Greg Rucka or Ed Brubaker (both of them have written far better Batman stories than Loeb here).	2004-05-31

Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created Superman to be the modern mythical hero ala' Hercules. Read the Golden Age tales collected in the Archive Editions. Superman fights for the everyman. Superman is a crusader. Superman is proactive and sometimes even works outside the law, all the while believing in the greater good. Then read this insipid volume and weep!<br />In the early days of the Silver Age (1950s), Superman is criticized for being more &quot;Steel&quot; than &quot;Man&quot;. Therefore the warm and funny &quot;Shazam&quot; comics were outselling Superman nearly every month. When Mort Weisinger brought in Jerry Siegel and Otto Binder to rework the entire Superman mythos in the late 1950s, however, the book took on a change for the better. We are introduced to a Superman Family and to his Kryptonian past. Superman became a character with tragedy, family and fun all mixed together. With the 1986 revamp of the character by John Byrne, he became even more &quot;human&quot;, having grown up in Smallville and all. The team of Dan Jurgens, Louise Simonson, Roger Stern and Jerry Ordway sought to always balance the &quot;Steel&quot; and the &quot;Man&quot; showing him as a very powerful hero who at the same time have very human sentiments.<br />Then came Jeph Loeb. &quot;Superman For All Seasons&quot;, the Smallville TV series and now this. Superman is no longer the Man of Steel. He's now the man of soft-putty. Granted, Loeb wanted to bring Supes back to his Smallville roots but he tends to overdo it. Supes became a softie, a country-bumpkin. Worse is Superman's attitude towards his wife, Lois Lane. Granted, Supes is a good husband - but under the hands of Loeb and gang in this volume, Supes doesn't even dare to breathe unless Lois gives him permission! The melodrama is a little too much.<br />Now the story. Lois is acting like a total b*tch in this story. Superman is trying to suck up to her to make her stop acting so b*tchy! Turns out that Lois is actually replaced by Parasite (since when? oh, it happened off-panel?). Superman fights Parasite-Lois. That's all! Worse still, the story doesn't get resolved until the next insipid volume &quot;Critical Condition&quot; that is even worse than this one (if that is even possible)!!!<br />The only highlight here is the art by Ed McGuiness. Though not the traditional style associated with Superman, McGuiness is able to make everything look BIG and FUN almost effortlessly with his manga-esque art. As for the writing, most of it is done by Jeph Loeb and Joe Kelly. In my opinion, Joe Kelly can't write even if it is to save his life (read some of his JLA to see what I mean). As for Loeb, I actually like HOW he writes but not WHAT he writes. He has the ability to let the reader &quot;see&quot; into the thoughts of the characters but the plots are all so paper-thin that the whole thing amounts to nothing more than self-important introspection. <br />All in all, a TERRIBLE work by a creative team that should have delivered better. I dropped the Superman books not long after this story and the next, &quot;Critical Condition&quot;. If this trend continues, the &quot;condition&quot; of the Superman books is &quot;critical&quot; indeed!	2004-05-30

If, like me, you are a little tired of all those critical scholars who deconstruct everything you thought you once believed in, then you'll find this volume a breath of fresh air - and a good reminder of how our grandfathers used to handle the Word of God in such a reverent, humble and believing manner.	2004-05-30

This volume collects the &quot;Kingdom&quot; book-ends and all the one-shot character-studies that make up the deeper exploration of the future DC Universe. &quot;The Kingdom&quot; was a controversial work when it was released in the late nineties, chiefly because this work was done without the participation (nor the blessing) of &quot;Kingdom Come's&quot; original artist, Alex Ross. And as you can see from the other reviews here, that alone warrants this work to be condemned to comic-book hell for all eternity. I find that quite laughable really!<br />You see, there are comicbook fans and there are Alex Ross fans. The latter are nothing more than lap-dogs of the famed painter. Granted, the artwork here falls short of the fine paint jobs by Ross in the prequel but then that's an unfair comparison (comparing any artist to Ross is usually an unfair comparison anyway - and should never be the chief reason to accept or dismiss a specific work). But the issue is deeper than that even. Many of these aforementioned lap-dogs believe that &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; is chiefly the work of Alex Ross and that Mark Waid actually stole Ross' ideas for this lame-sequel. Nothing can be further from the truth. Mark Waid is the most passionate fan of Silver-Age comics and his work here as well as in &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; is a testimony to that fact.<br />While &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; serves as a final tribute and celebration of what makes Silver-Age heroism great (in view of the darker, grim-and-gritty characters of then-popular X-Men and Image books), &quot;The Kingdom&quot; is a true return of the Silver Age. The Silver Age is examined in a very deep and poignant way through the eyes of the children of those same heroes (i.e. Ibn, son of Batman; Nightshade, daughter of Robin; and the children of Flash and Plastic Man). Furthermore, we see the ramifications of Superman's actions (or, more appropriately, inaction) during &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; - and also the child of Superman and Wonder Woman (and god-child of Batman) as the &quot;everyman&quot; representing everyone of us who grew up influenced by the John Broome heroism of the 50s and 60s. This &quot;child&quot; (representing all us Silver Age fans) is therefore the appropriate guardian of all the best stories that DC had to offer in the past through a device called &quot;Hypertime&quot;. To this &quot;child&quot;, the Golden Age Superman and Silver Age Superman is as real as the current canonical post-Crisis Superman. The &quot;Hypertime&quot; concept is really representative of the imagination. It does not supplant the effects of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Worlds&quot;. It is really the infinite universe of &quot;Just Imagine...&quot;!<br />This is the passion of Mark Waid. This is the celebration of the spirit of imagination. This work returns us to the Silver Age and the Silver Age back to us. Every work of imagination &quot;counts&quot; (not just those that are &quot;in-continuity&quot;). Every work of imagination is to be celebrated (not just those painted by Alex Ross!). This is the Kingdom of &quot;Just Imagine...&quot; and the purpose of comic-books in the first place.	2004-05-30

Retro, introspective meditation on an iconic character. And teamed with Tim Sale, the duo delivers one of the most heartfelt reexamination of the Superman mythos ever. I do not dislike this work but I dislike everything that came as a result of this work:<br />1) Loeb is made the chief writer of the Superman books and there his weakness is glaring. The man is all retro and introspection all the time but very, very weak on plots. He's great for a work like this one as well as his Marvel \\"color\\" books. But not for regular monthly work where plot is chief. Superman is turned into a softie, country-bumpkin under his care.<br />2) \\"Smallville\\". 'Nuff said!<br />Upon rereading, I'll say that \\"Superman For All Seasons\\" serve as a nice momento from the early days of Superman's story but does little more than that. It doesn't really progress the Superman mythos nor challenge our views of Superman. It simply rephrases (in a rather melodramatic way) what we already know and commonly agree to be true. It's pretty but in a rather empty way in that it really offers so little.	2004-05-30

In the 1960s, the greatest entertainment in the world can be gotten for a mere 10 cents between the pages of the various Superman comics published. You get everything from grand space-opera, soapy romance, mythical adventures, sci-fi, fantasy, tragedy, etc. in these stories. This volume is a great sample of some of those great tales.<br />Mort Weisinger was the man behind the Superman titles at DC comics in the 1950s and 1960s. He hired writers like Jerry Siegel (yes, the original creator himself) and Otto Binder (the greatest &quot;Shazam&quot; writer ever) to recreate Superman's world. Firstly, Supes' origin story is more fully fleshed out, Krypton is described in detail and then came the creation of the &quot;Superman Family&quot; (Supergirl, Krypto, Perry White, Jimmy Olsen, Bizarro, Superboy, Legion of Superheroes, etc. etc.) - all of it giving us the richesh fantasy dreamworld in serialized fiction.<br />Get this volume to relive the magic of Superman and rediscover the reason why he is still the foremost heroic-icon of our times.	2004-05-30

What you need to know before reading this book:<BR>1) Superman stories published from 1938 to 1986 (commonly called &quot;Pre-Crisis Superman&quot;) were wiped out of continuity and is no longer part of the Superman Canon.<BR>2) An event called &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; cleaned up DC Comics continuity and recreated the DC Universe in 1985/6. All comics from that point to the present are referred to as the &quot;Post-Crisis&quot; stories.<BR>3) The &quot;Post-Crisis&quot; Superman began with 1986's &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; miniseries by John Byrne (collected as Volume One)<BR>4) This volume (Vol. 2) collects the first three issues of the normal Superman comics immediately following &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; miniseries - therefore giving us a good representation of the &quot;New&quot; Superman and how it all began (again).<br />The majority of the stories collected in this volume are written and drawn by John Byrne, who was also responsible for the revamp in the first place. The rest of the stories are written by Marv Wolfman (who also provided the &quot;Intro&quot; to this volume) and beautifully drawn by Jerry Ordway. The stories read like a continuation of &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;. While the previous volume gave us the new Krypton, the new Pa/Ma Kent, Brainiac, Luthor, etc., this volume gives us Cat Grant, the new Metallo, Prof. Emil Hamilton and further fleshes out the malicious character of Lex Luthor. In addition to that, we have three issues of Superman in Apokolips (actually part of the &quot;Legends&quot; crossover but it can very well stand alone by itself) with a superb rendition of Darkseid, Orion, Lightray and the rest of the classic Kirby creations by John Byrne. <br />This volume is highly recommended to all Superman historians (like me!) and all fans of John Byrne (the man was at his very best here).	2004-05-30

As you can see from nearly every other review here, this work is generally considered a classic - if not one of the all-time best Batman stories, up there with those Frank Miller ones. I disagree. And I disagree reluctantly because Alan Moore's writing is actually very clever and Brian Bolland's artwork is simply gorgeous. Why? Simple. I disagree with nearly everything about Alan Moore's \\"Batman\\". Frank Miller mentioned something like that in an interview also. Even Alan Moore has stated countless times that this is his weakest work. But fans still clamour after this book...<br />Five reasons I dislike this book:<br />[1] Batman is totally wrong. It seemed like the pet-peeve of every cynical Brit writer in the 80s and 90s to portray Batman as equally insane compared to his foes [check out Grant Morrison's \\"Arkham Asylum\\" for more of the same].<br />[2] The hopeless ending. Agreed, this book has the Joker at his most evil and the book ends with Batman and Joker laughing in the rain?<br />[3] The level of *sick* shocks in this book. From Barbara Gordon's crippling to Jim Gordon's \\"circus\\" experience. This was written at a period where shocking violence in comics is considered a prerequisite in crafting a \\"mature\\" work. Granted, I actually prefer Barbara as Oracle than the cheesy Batgirl but I absolutely detest the way Alan Moore did it in this book.<br />[4] The totally unnecessary \\"origin\\" of Joker. Joker is one of those characters in comics who really can do without an origin. He is a sicko, and that's all you need to know. We do not need to see him from a more compassionate perspective by having a \\"tragic origin\\".<br />[5] The use of \\"Watchmen-transitions\\". Alan Moore is justly famous for the use of clever transitions between panels. But in this book, we have transitions such as a poster of a fat woman freak in a circus leading to the next panel of Joker's pregnant wife. Where's the catch? This is the real problem of the whole work - clever but ultimately pointless.	2004-05-11

Writer Doug Moench and artist Paul Gulacy worked their cinematic-comic magic on \\"Master of Kung-Fu\\" around two decades ago. They later collaborated on the wonderful \\"Batman:Prey\\". But for me, their best work is here on \\"Batman/Predator II\\". Batman is hunted by an insane Predator warrior and half a dozen of the top assassins in the world (hired by the mob). His only help comes from the Huntress - the last person he ever wants to work with.<br />The feel of this book is like watching a really good action movie - with the suspense and thrill of the first \\"Predator\\" movie even. Moench handles the characterization and reluctant partnerships of Batman and Huntress very well - in fact, I'd go so far as to say that this is my favourite Huntress story to date. Moench manage to capture everything that makes Huntress such an interestingly flawed character. As for the art, the Predators look downright scary, Batman is his usual cool-operator (and we even get to see the Bat-bike again) and Huntress is very sexy. Very fast and exciting read overall!	2004-05-11

To some, like me, they represent some of the best comics entertainment during our growing-up years. Rereading it, I realized that it is still the most apt comic for the adolescent in all of us. <br />This DC Archive Edition reprints the first eight issues of the series along with the New Teen Titans' debut in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; (a backup feature in an impossibly hard-to-find issue). Perez's detailed art and Romeo Tanghal's tight inking are beautifully reproduced throughout - although certain panels appear a little darker than the original (the ink bleeds much better in the original newsprint). <br />The stories here are beautiful characterizations of teenagers who behave like teenagers - albeit endowed with powers and costumes. Read especially the story in issue 8, spotlighting the quieter, personal moments of each Titan. Other important points include the debut of Deathstroke the Terminator and Trigon - two classic Titans villains that continue to plague the team even in today's Geoff Johns penned series.	2004-05-11

The premise of this novel and the original comics are really quite simple (albeit quite a stretch, I have to admit). Gotham City is ravaged by an earthquake, the U.S. Government refuse to repair the damage and the citizens are ordered to move out. All bridges and entry-points are detonated - only the insane and hopeless stay back. Batman decides to stay on as the protector of his city - whatever is left of it!<br />Now once you've suspended your disbelief over the unlikely premise, you'll find that this story actually works on many levels. Especially in our times - we are seeing daily how people in Afghanistan and Iraq are working hard to bring order and a semblance of sanity back into their lives. And it works especially well for Batman. Batman, after all, is a Bruce Wayne's method of &quot;forcing&quot; his existence to make sense after witnessing his parents' brutal murder as a kid all those years back. Now, Batman is &quot;forcing&quot; a hopeless city back to order and meaning.<br />The original comics (now collected neatly into five tradepaperback) were great. Greg Rucka's novel is better. Somehow, seeing this story in prose makes it that much more &quot;serious&quot;. Rucka, in this novel, decides to write more from the point of view of Gordon, Montoya, Essen and the GCPD rather than emphasizing the role of the costumed-vigilantes the way the comics do. Each section of the novel is prefaced by the journal entries of the crippled Barbara Gordon (the former Batgirl and now Oracle). The 'personal' touch of Barb's diaries makes the story just that much more potent and emotional. Even the exploits of Batman, the new Batgirl, Nightwing, etc. are seen through her eyes - driving home to the readers once more just how closely knitted the Bat-family really is and how much they really care/understand/emphatize with each other.<br />In my opinion, Rucka's comicbook writing is hit-and-miss game. Sometimes, he's great (&quot;Wonder Woman: The Hikketia&quot;, &quot;Huntress:Cry For Blood&quot;, &quot;Queen &amp; Country&quot;) and sometimes he just doesn't do it for me. He is still first and foremost a novelist and this book, &quot;Batman: No Man's Land&quot; is further proof that the man can craft a fine novel.	2004-05-09

Kevin Smith brought Oliver Queen back from the dead in &quot;Quiver&quot; and &quot;Sounds of Violence&quot;. Brad Meltzer, in his first comic work to date, picks up the book where Smith left off and gives us the best character-driven Green Arrow story ever - a story that brings Ollie back to LIFE!<br />The premise of the story is simple - Ollie and his long-time ward, Roy Harper (aka &quot;Speedy&quot; aka &quot;Arsenal) goes on the road to find pieces of Ollie's life. Brad Meltzer gives us a story reminiscent of the classic &quot;Hard Travellin' Heroes&quot; on-the-road stories of Ollie and Hal Jordan, but with a twist! While those classic stories showed the duo in search of the true heart of a nation, this story is the search for Ollie's true heart. That makes this story intensely personal and refreshingly sentimental.<br />It is ultimately an introspective look into who and what is Oliver Queen, a man with ties to almost every important person in the DC Universe, who has more heart than almost anyone and at the same time harbors some of the darkest secrets - and by the end of the book, we see some of those secrets surfacing and the gnawing effect it has on the man. But this book is never pessimistic or bleak. In fact, ever since the beginning of this new series (with Smith's &quot;Quiver&quot;), there is an overwhelming sense of triumphant joy displayed throughout the storytelling. Perhaps this has to do with the very expressive art of Phil Hester and Ande Parks - who are soon turning to be the definitive G.A. artists of our generation. I admit that I wasn't immediately taken to their more &quot;cartoonish&quot; style since most of the great G.A. artists of the past employ a far more realistic art style; e.g. Neal Adams and Mike Grell.<br />The book also includes the full script to chapter one, a foreword by some senator and afterwords by Brad Meltzer and Greg Rucka along with the reproduced covers and some notes about the creation of those Matt Wagner painted covers.<br />Lastly, I'd like to say something about the current trends in comics-storytelling. In recent years, there seems to be a general aversion towards stories built over decades of continuity. The clearest representation of this are works of the Nu-Marvel folks - especially those involve in the &quot;Ultimate&quot; books. The reason is simple - books not-mired by continuity make easier &quot;jump-on&quot; points and thus the possibility of hooking new readers. Well, this Green Arrow story, along with those by Kevin Smith, are rooted in DECADES of continuity. And that's why is works! The storytelling acknowledges everything that came before - giving the characters of Oliver Queen, Roy Harper, Dinah Lance, Connor Hawke, etc a surprising amount of depth and emotional realism - while reinterpreting these Silver Age characters with the more-informed complexities of our age. In my book, that's the meaning of &quot;Ultimate&quot; - not rootless but the genuine and best version of something. Take my challenge - give this book, &quot;Green Arrow: The Archer's Quest&quot; to anyone, any non-comic reader, and see his/her reaction. The high chance is that he/she may soon become a fan and start digging deeper to understand the history and background of it all. This is the Ultimate Green Arrow.	2004-04-29

William Lane's commentary on &quot;Mark&quot; is very scholarly and balanced. He employs redaction criticism as his primary method to extract the most out of the &quot;present form&quot; of Mark's gospel and shows us how rewarding it is to do it this way. At the same time, Lane pays attention to many theological issues (such as &quot;the Wilderness motif in Mark&quot;, &quot;the Messianic secret&quot;, etc.) and historical/textual issues (e.g.- &quot;Mark 16&quot;, Dead Sea Scrolls discoveries, comparisons between Peter's sermons in &quot;Acts&quot; and the literary/compositional style of Mark). The overall result is a commentary that is at the same time a great reference work, a great instruction manual and a great devotional tool. Personally, I became interested in many Gospel issues such as Form/Source/Redaction Criticism, the Synoptic Problem, the revelation/hidden Christ, the centrality of the Passion, etc. after reading this work. Highly recommended!	2004-04-27

I agree with Milan Kundera in that people who read a book because of its notorious reputation often overlook the true literary value of the work - i.e. it is first and foremost a novel, not a tract or a manifesto.<br />Wei Hui is representative of the generation of educated Chinese who were born towards the late 1970s and grew up during the materialistic 1980s and came to maturity during the bleak/cynical 1990s - more influenced by Henry Miller than Confucius, preferring the self-effacing songs of postmodern Faye Wong to traditional classics like \\"The Butterfly Lovers\\", enraptured by Allen Ginsberg in place of Li Po and Tu Fu. In this work, Wei Hui writes in an autobiographical style reminiscent of Henry Miller's \\"Tropic of Cancer\\". Frankly, in many ways, the Shanghai of 1999-2000 mirrors the Paris of the 1920s and 1930s... and Wei Hui brings it all to brilliant life in this novel. The writing is sensuous and hungry - with a lust for life matching Walt Whitman - wanting to touch and taste everything. Everything is deeply felt and meditated upon. Wei Hui's prose is at times as potent as the most beautiful poetry - albeit with some odd exceptions such as the rather inapt \\"Shanghai winter is wet and disgusting - like a woman's period\\"! But you can almost forgive her many faults owing to so many beautifully luxuriant phrases in it that reminds you of the wonder of being alive and being young and being sensitive to your surroundings. <br />The story by now is so well known that it's quite redundant to repeat it here - the protagonist of the novel is in love with two men; an impotent Chinese artist and a sexually-inexhautible German expatriate. Personally, I find that in the reading of the novel, I am more drawn towards the minor characters such as Madonna, Ah Dick, Zhu Sha, etc. than the main characters. Why? I feel that the main characters are too archetypal of this kind of modern Asian writing (therefore very formulaic) - the minor characters are the most human and are more representative of the \\"real\\" people that populate Shanghai today. Ultimately, the novel is a Kerouac-like \\"road trip\\" into the emotional/sexual terrains of modern China as the protagonist searches for \\"fulfilment\\" (I think that's the right word - \\"love\\" and \\"lust\\" and \\"security\\" seems too trite) - all within a Kundera-like awareness of the flimsiness and fragility of our existence - \\"in Shanghai, one can die anytime of a car accident or a disease\\".	2004-04-27
US	52496057	R2DXO10V1A8XPP	156389601X	123266493	Superman: They Saved Luthor's Brain (Superman (DC Comics))	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Interesting Superhuman Fantasy!	&quot;They Saved Luthor's Brain&quot; collects several storyarcs featuring the early post-Crisis Lex Luthor and Superman (all happening before the famed &quot;Death of Superman&quot;). The high point of this collection is the characterization of Luthor as the archetypal self-made man of the '90s whose hatred for Superman stems from his feeling of being supplanted as &quot;Metropolis Favourite Son&quot; by this alien being.<br />The first story in this collection (Superman #2) is by John Byrne and it's also one of the best Superman stories ever (it's also included in &quot;The Greatest Superman Stories Ever Told&quot; collection). In it Lex Luthor, with the aid of scientists and supercomputers, actually successfully deduced Superman's secret identity - Clark Kent! But in true Luthor form, he arrogantly dismiss the machines' deductions since he can never accept that the one who supplanted him is actually the pansy-boy, Clark Kent!<br />The second storyarc features the gradual deterioration of Luthor's body owing to Kryptonite poisoning. It's written by Roger Stern and pencilled by Bob McLeod (both creators at their peak during this story). This story ultimately ends with the &quot;death&quot; of Luthor and its aftermath - painting the archvillain as truly larger-than-life (and a lot madder). This reviewer recommends &quot;Krisis of the Krimson Kryptonite&quot; as background reading since this chapter is the climax of that storyarc.<br />The third storyarc gives us the appearance of a mysterious stranger from Australia claiming to be the heir of Luthor - Lex Luthor II. Roger Stern writes this arc also and manages to give us a brilliantly charismatic Luthor II albeit with hints that there's more to this guy than meets the eye. The readers as well as Lois, Clark and Perry is desperate to know the truth about this man.<br />The fourth and final storyarc actually comes after the famed &quot;Panic in the Sky&quot; story (read that TPB first). Luthor II is now embraced as ahero on par with Superman in that he saved Metropolis from both an economic downturn and an alien invasion (Brainiac). The Matrix-Supergirl appears in this storyarc as noted by a previous reviewer and she's very beautifully rendered by penciller Jackson Guice. The final chapter of this storyarc reveals the chilling details behind the mysterious Luthor II and sets up the events for the cataclysmic &quot;Death of Superman&quot; that follows soon after.<br />In my opinion, the Luthor in these earlier tales is far better than the recent ones by Jeph Loeb and company - showing Luthor as US President. For one thing, this Luthor is far more sinister and his hatred/envy for Superman is so overwhelming that it literally can be &quot;felt&quot; by the reader. Also recommended - &quot;The Unauthorized Biography of Lex Luthor&quot; as a companion piece to this collection.	2004-04-27

In the uncertain and cynical early 1990s, it really looked like the poster-boy for idealistic, traditional morals and the voice of paternal authority may really be headed towards oblivion. Image Comics was booming with their anti-heroes and kids were really digging the songs of Kurt Cobain. Does Superman still have any relevance in the 1990s? In fact, that was one of the underlying (yet often ignored) subtle themes in this storyline. Teenagers in school were supposed to tune in to a Superman interview on TV but many of them were uninterested in listening to a &quot;washed-out has-been&quot;, preferring instead the obnoxious and cynical Guy Gardner. In fact, Superman's only &quot;fan&quot; in the story seems to be this little black orphan called Keith.<br />Then, Doomsday happened! A monster fights Superman for dozens of pages and Superman dies defending his beloved city, Metropolis, against said monster. That's all there really was to the plot.<br />But suddenly we sat up and took notice. Suddenly we realized just what we have lost. A symbol. A hero. An icon. And we see it most starkly through the teary eyes of &quot;Superman's Girlfriend Lois Lane&quot; and &quot;Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot;. <br />DC Comics returned to iconic heroism in comics in the mid-1990s. But in the early 1990s, they had to shock the readers into realizing their folly for ignoring the &quot;originals&quot; - thus, Superman got killed, Batman got crippled, Wonder Woman was replaced, Aquaman lost a hand, Green Arrow died and Green Lantern went nuts. But don't blame DC. It was what the disloyal, Image-buying fans deserved... and it was what they ultimately got. This story, &quot;The Death of Superman&quot; is the clearest example of DC's &quot;shock-treatment&quot; event. It is a product of its times.	2004-03-28

And I've never had much interest in &quot;Aliens&quot; or &quot;Predators&quot;... or movie tie-in comic creations for that matter. &quot;Superman/Aliens&quot;, however, is a whole different thing altogether.<br />Firstly, it is a &quot;real&quot; Superman story set in the continuity of time when it was published. Most crossovers are too light-weight because you know that ultimately it's all &quot;just an imaginary story&quot; and you can always go back to your beloved character next month and nothing's changed. Not so with this book. This story matters on many levels. There were many references made to previous Superman storylines like the &quot;Exile&quot; story where Superman regrets having to commit murder and the &quot;Doomsday&quot; stories. Not surprising since this book is also by Dan Jurgens, the man responsible for guiding the Superman books for close to a decade. (Note: The only other crossover that &quot;mattered&quot; was &quot;Aliens/WildC.A.T.S&quot; wherein the whole Stormwatch team was killed and that set the ground for &quot;The Authority&quot; series.)<br />Secondly, we get a great Silver-Age concept - Superman is depowered. Before reading this, I was apprehensive. I mean, what can the Aliens do to the near-invulnerable Man of Steel anyway? I thought it was going to be a one-sided fight with the odds on Superman. Turned out it was the other way round. We have a depowered Superman against a whole horde of acid-dripping, man-eating Aliens and he's not even armed like Sigouney Weaver in the movies! The result is a great Die-Hard style story.<br />Thirdly, we see the return of Kara. I'm a huge fan of the original Supergirl since watching the movie as a kid. And I was devastated by her death in 1985 during the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. In fact, George Perez's drawing of that infamous cover where a teary Superman carries Kara's lifeless body in his arms is one of the images that has been forever burned into my subconscious mind. Granted, there was a Supergirl in the comics - but like all purists, the Matrix/Linda/Supergirl just wasn't the real McCoy to me! Thus, in this book, we have a Kara of Argo City who may or may not be the One...<br />Dan Jurgens writing is solid as usual and his artwork is even more amazing here when inked by the talented Kevin Nowlan - though I must admit that it takes some getting used to. But then, Nowlan's darker inks are perfectly suitable for this story. It's a lot more violent and bloody than the typical Superman tale and we have a Supes debating within himself the dark act of unavoidable-murder as a &quot;final solution&quot; - thus making a far darker Superman tale than we're used to.	2004-03-28

Superman generally goes against common crooks in those days and he's far less powerful then - although this volume shows us the first time he &quot;float in the air&quot; rather than merely &quot;leaping great heights&quot; - he still can't fly like we are used to yet.<br />This volume also reproduces all the original ads, prose stories and covers thus giving the reader an authentic Golden Age reading experience.	2004-03-28

Superman is infected by a virus and Lois Lane is missing. This sets up the storyline for this book. Except there's one problem! Namely, we never did get to see any of the two events happening at all! WHEN and HOW did Superman get infected? WHEN and HOW did Lois Lane go missing? Everything was shown \\"off-panel\\" - meaning we get some explanation later in expositional-style-flashback-dialogues-and-captions.<br />Furthermore, we have a totally out-of-character Batman recording in a cold way his step-by-step detective work, referring to Lois constantly as \\"the subject\\" (something that Batman will NEVER do - he believes too much in the individual to ever call anyone that, especially a close friend like Lois). Out-of-character Batman is teamed up with a wimpy, sick and badly-drawn Superman. And the whole lot is written by Joe Kelly who's only gift in comic-writing seems to be witty one-liners and toilet-humor.<br />And did I mention the uneven artwork? Interestingly, it was Marvel that began the manga-esque influence in their artwork (most noticeably in the X-Men books by Joe Madureira). Here, we have the massive artwork of Ed McGuiness coupled with several bad mangaesque artist like the Wizard Award Winner whose name I cannot even recall. Personally, I think a traditional character like Superman should be drawn by someone with a more traditional style like Steve Epting or Tom Derenick. McGuiness' art is fun but usually lacking in emotion and characterization. The rest of the pack in this book is simply horrendous. In fact, I dropped the Superman books immediately after this storyline.	2004-03-28

The X-treme Team faces an invasion from another dimension and deals with the villain from the first book, Vargas. Salvador Larroca's uninked artwork is far better and clearer here than even in the first book. This book is recommended for readers who enjoy Claremont's characterisation as that's the real draw of this storyline. Rogue and Storm are the real stars here - and if you're a fan of either of those X-women, you better get this volume!<br />Finally, for those who complain about Claremont's expositional writing or seemingly \\"direction-less\\" writing, check out this volume to see how much planning and thought goes into his comics. I've always felt that Nu-Marvel is sorely lacking in the kind of grand, Shakespearean style of writing that Marvel used to be known for. Check out any Jim Shooter, Jim Starlin, Roy Thomas, Steve Englehart, etc. writings to see what I mean. Claremont brings that back in spades here. His wordy, expositional style works perfectly with a story like that.	2004-03-04

That's not difficult to understand seeing how the man has been involved with the X-books for close to 30 years or so (his very public exit in the 1992 notwithstanding). Here in the \\"X-treme X-Men\\" title is Claremont Updated for Today. And here, he teams with his art-partner from his run on Fantastic Four, the hyper-talented Salvador Larroca, to give us a very modern, very hip and very sexy X-Men team.<br />The premise of the story is this: the X-Treme team gets away from the rest of the X-Men to embark on a mission of their own. Their objective: to obtain the diaries of the late mutant precog, Irene Adler/Destiny, who supposedly records the future of the world. The main reason they are the \\"away\\" team is because they are also trying their best to prevent the diaries from falling into the hands of their mentor, Charles Xavier! Claremont does some fine explanation that in some way Xavier is as dangerous as Magneto (Magneto is a fanatic and Xavier is an idealist). Along the way, they meet a new villain called Vargas who did major damage to the team (even killing one of them). <br />As usual, Claremont's writing is very, very wordy and expositional. But for long time readers like me, that is exactly why we love the man. Today's readers seem to like the \\"wide-screen\\" storytelling of writers like Mark Millar and Warren Ellis. Claremont is old-school compared to them, having served under the editorships of men like Len Wein and Jim Shooter. And that's why he works for me - I always feel like having READ something after one of his issues. Furthermore, his scripts have this mesmerizing quality in them that can get pretty addictive after a while - you'll know what I mean if you talk to any 1970s/80s comic reader. <br />Salvador Larroca's pencils are beautiful. I especially like how he draws facial expressions. He is equally adept at large-scale action scenes as he is with the quieter,more introspective moments. As a bonus, his pencils are un-INKED in X-treme X-Men. The overall effect is a somewhat dream-like comic experience. The only downside is that some panels come off rather blur in this first volume. But rest assured, his pencils are more legible in the second and third volume of this series.	2004-03-04

To many, the classic death of Jean Grey/Phoenix on the moon at the end of the \\"Dark Phoenix Saga\\" is not something to be tampered with. Therefore, when Marvel decided to resurrect Jean for the formation of X-Factor in the mid-1980s, many felt cheated. They felt that this story cheapened the original \\"death\\". For me, I'm glad that Jean is alive again (although she's dead again in the recent Grant Morrison X-Men run, I was told!). I felt that this story opened up so many story possibilities - especially the emotional tug-of-war that Cyclops, then married to Jean-lookalike, Madelyne Pryor, had to face.<br />The problem with many comic fans is that they can't seem to see beyond the \\"scandal\\" or \\"controversy\\". For example, the Batman story, \\"A Death in the Family\\". Everytime you hear fans discussing that storyline, they have to bring in the controversial decision that D.C. made at that time to set up a 1-800 number for people to call in voting whether to let Robin live or die. Seeing beyond that little piece of marketing ploy, the story by Jim Starlin and Jim Aparo is pretty tight and solid. Same thing here. Jean Grey lives. The Phoenix entity that died on the moon was a different person altogether (therefore, Jean is not guilty of the crimes committed by Dark Phoenix). If the fans would just take time to examine the story carefully, they would find this a solid book to begin with.<br />Firstly, we have the issue from Avengers wherein the cocoon holding Jean underwater is found. The fans also screamed when they discovered this - Jean's resurrection taking place in \\"Avengers\\" rather than \\"Uncanny X-Men\\". But then that was the time when Jim Shooter was head at Marvel and continuity BETWEEN the books was very tight (unlike the current no-continuity nu-Marvel). I, for one, do not see a problem with that. And I'm thankful to see again the work of Roger Stern, John Buscema and Tom Palmer, whom I considerthe best Avengers creators ever (check out their work on \\"Avengers: Under Siege\\" to see what I mean). The second part of the storyline takes place in \\"Fantastic Four\\" and it's largely written and drawn by John Byrne. Great flashback scenes here explain in detail what really happened to Jean and Phoenix in \\"X-Men #101\\". I was told that Chris Claremont tampered a little with this story and some panels were redrawn by Jackson Guice. This, of course, contributed to Byrne's finally leaving the FF soon after. The best part of the book, and also the part that packs the most emotional punch is the last chapter - a reprint of X-Factor #1. Bob Layton writes and Jackson Guice pencils this tale of how Jean's closest pals/lovers, namely, the original X-Men, react to her being alive again.<br />Reading this carefully, one can see the seeds being planted for future storylines in the X-books like \\"Inferno\\" and \\"X-cutioner's Song\\". Scott is pushed to the limit emotionally and ends up a wreck, abandoning his wife Madelyne and son, Nathan. The original five X-Men, including Jean, forms X-Factor. The last panel with Madelyne discovering Scott's \\"unfaithfulness\\" on TV (in an X-Factor ad) is priceless.<br />Lastly, this book comes with an Introduction by Kurt Busiek, who had the guts to claim credit for coming up with the idea of Jean's resurrection in the first place. Overall solid writing and art throughout. Long live Jean...	2004-03-02

It collects the classic &quot;Fall of the Mutants&quot; themed story-arcs in the X-Men, X-Factor and New Mutants books. The whole thing is not a crossover, it's a themed-collection of stories. A turning point and one of the darkest eras in the X-history.<br />1) The X-Men dies in Dallas... in full public view.<BR>2) The X-Factor face Apocalypse in Manhattan (in my opinion, the greatest Apocalypse story ever written and drawn)<BR>3) The New Mutants confront issues of life, freedom and death... and loses their innocence.<br />What more do you need to know?	2004-03-02

The stories here are nothing to shout about though the Claremont wit is to be seen in many panels. The real draw of the book is Lee's art which is gloriously reproduced here. For those of us who grew up in the 1980s, we felt this revolution firsthand. Comic books would never be the same again after Lee. The impact of his hyper-detailed, solid-bodied art hit comic-readers the way Neal Adams did in the 1970s. Lee understands the iconism and sexiness of superhero comics and display his knack for capturing both with his pencils (aided by inker Scott Williams).<br />The highlights:<br />1) Lee draws the best one-page splash Captain America EVER!<br />2) Psylocke's transformation from English lady to sexy Asian assassin.<br />3) The Crossing storyline - see Jim Lee draw cosmic! Shiar, the Imperial Guard, the Starjammers, etc.<br />4) The Magneto/Rogue Savage Land storyline - Jim Lee's Magneto is unbelievable. Regal, majestic and sexy at the same time. This is a Magneto that a girl will fall in love with - and literally does - the girl in question, unlikely as it is, Rogue! See also Jim Lee's drawing of Nick Fury, the SHIELD helicarrier and Kazar.<br />Get this volume and the following volume, \\"X-Men: Mutant Genesis\\" for the greatest X-Men eye-candy in history.	2004-03-02

Upon rereading &quot;Inferno&quot;, I was surprised by the maturity and sensitivity in the crafting of this X-Men story. Lots of comic books that came out from the late 1980s until today try to portray &quot;maturity&quot; by resorting to post-modern themes or shock-value. Check out a number of D.C. Vertigo books to know what I mean. Not that they are bad. In fact, most of them (e.g. Sandman) are pretty good. Just that the bulk of them (even the best of them), at times comes off as merely artsy pretensions.<br />&quot;X-Men: Inferno&quot; is a straight-forward superhero story. It is the capstone of the whole &quot;Phoenix&quot; saga (incl. &quot;Dark Phoenix Saga&quot;, &quot;From the Ashes&quot; and &quot;Phoenix Rising&quot;). Madelyne Pryor goes on a rampage as a woman scorned and she literally brings hell to earth. In the middle, we also get the final resolution to the whole Illyana Rasputin/Magick saga.<br />Why do I like this volume so much? Firstly, the craft and design of the work is akin to the three circles of Dante's Inferno. We have the first circle here dealing with each of the X-Men's weaknesses (sins), then the second circle of the Magick saga and the final circle of Madelyne's epic battle - and finally the revelation of the devil at the bottom of the pit, Mr. Sinister. Wonderful planning and design throughout. Secondly, I found the work dealt with issues of adultery, vanity, vengence, sibling rivalry, repentance, etc. all presented in a mature and sensitive manner - without the pretensions of today's comics. Read it again to see Dazzler's vanity, the Marauders' violence, Madelyne's pain, Jean's tenderness, Havok's insecurity and Cyclops' regret. Thirdly, we have the introduction to one of the most interesting, Faustian villain ever - Mister Sinister - and a resolution to the events set in motion during the &quot;Morlock Massacre&quot; prior to this story. In many ways, this story is a closure - many of the dangling plotlines are resolved. In other ways, this story, like the best X-Men stories, marks a new beginning - the X-Men finally comes face-to-face with the X-Factor and this marks the beginning of the &quot;extended family&quot; concept in the X-books, laying the ground for future storylines.	2004-03-02

Ask any comic reader who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s to name their favourite X-Men stories of all time and you usually get the usual &quot;Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; or &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;. But if you really want to know the REAL reason why the X-Men were the hottest comic characters in those decades, you gotta check out this volume. It has everything that makes the X-Men what they are. Great character moments, milestones, multiple plotlines, fantastic action and camaraderie. This volume highlights creators Chris Claremont and Paul Smith at their best. We get Wolverine's wedding and rejection by Mariko, the Silver Samurai Saga, Rogue's entry into the X-Men, the first (and best) Marauders story with Storm winning the leadership from Callisto, Caliban's crush on Kitty Pryde, the first appearance of Lockheed, Kitty's pet dragon and finally, Madelyne Pryor's first appearance and wedding to Scott Summers.

But back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he was the hottest artist in the industry. I wonder what happened to his fans then? Maybe they simply grew up and suddenly felt embarrassed over their one-time affection for the steroids-pumped characters of Liefeld?<br />Check out this volume to see the work that made Rob Liefeld a star in the late '80s. It collects the final issues of New Mutants, a title that was deteriorating until Louise Simonson and Rob Liefeld turned it around with the stories in this volume. And they did it in such a simple fashion - they injected in a Terminator-knock-off called Cable and the book was suddenly infused with a new life, a new energy like never before. And as with every new character to be introduced into the X-Books in those days, there is the inevitable clash with Wolverine, somewhat like a &quot;baptism of fire&quot; or something like that (rest assured, that's also reprinted in this volume).	2004-03-01

It is edited by Charles F. Pfeiffer (OT) and Everett F. Harrison (NT); and represents the best of the American Reformed scholarship. For a volume of its portable size and scope, it certainly covers a lot of ground. Essays introducing each individual book covers many important authorship/stylistic/history issues and represent the views of scholars from many different theological persuasion. This is followed by book-outlines and a &quot;phrase-by-phrase&quot; commentary on each book. Bibligraphy sections that accompany each book's commentary are also helpful for deeper research and studies. <br />All in all, this volume avoids many extremes and usually present their views from a reverent, relevant yet objective stance. It differs from the wafer-thin style of commentary of the Dallas Theological Seminary volumes as well as the (in my opinion), overtly &quot;devotional&quot; style commentary by Matthew Henry. Many scholarly views/counter-views are carefully considered and space is given to recent archaeological/historical findings.	2004-02-22

Harrison's monumental single-volume &quot;Introduction to the Old Testament&quot; packs in everything you need to get started with a serious study of the Hebrew Scriptures. You will be acquainted especially with the history of scholarly criticisms (e.g. the Graf-Wellhausen JEPD stuff), archaeology, Ancient Near Eastern cultures and languages, book-by-book criticisms, development of theology in the OT era, etc. etc.<br />Over my years of studying the OT, I have noticed the ever-widening gap between the pew and the academia. The average Church-goer is woefully uninformed regarding issues of OT interpretation. Zealous readers who desire to get more out of their Bible-reading will probably be boggled by the amount of information and views/counter-views of any Critical Commentaries. Most of the time, they have to struggle to understand what was the &quot;big deal&quot; in all the endless arguments of scholars in the said commentaries (I know I did!). Harrison puts all the necessary views/counter-views in one convenient package to acquaint the serious reader with the &quot;esoterica&quot; of the academia.<br />Harrison hails from the traditional-conservative position. However, he gives ample ground for the presentation and careful consideration of the views of &quot;higher critics&quot; and liberal scholars... all with an objectivity that is laudable in this age of strawberry-flavoured &quot;devotionals&quot;. He speaks his mind in many instances - but more with the aim of stimulating his reader to think rather than to convince you of the &quot;infallibility&quot; of traditional-conservative views. All the above reasons make this the BEST single-volume introduction to a lifelong serious study of the Hebrew Scriptures.	2004-02-22

Granted, it does not have the scope of the classic cosmic tales like &quot;Kree-Skrull War&quot; and &quot;Celestial Madonna&quot;. In fact, the whole work feels a little too &quot;earthy&quot; and the action is mainly limited to one place - Avengers Mansion. But what ACTION it is! The Masters of Evil, in their most powerful incarnation EVER, invades Avengers Mansion and takes over it!<br />Roger Stern is a solid Marvel writer in the 1980s under the editorship of Jim Shooter. We rarely see such dependable work-horse comic-writers today. &quot;Under Siege&quot; remains one of Sterns greatest writings (along with his work on Dr. Strange). There is an almost effortless feel to the way Stern seems to nail down the characterization of all the characters (most notably on the second-stringers like Black Knight, Hercules, Wasp, etc.) John Buscema and Tom Palmer provides the art. The art really shines in the last chapter when the heavyweights like Thor and Captain America join the fray to reclaim Avengers Mansion. We see the restrain and control in Buscema's powerful art - Thor vs. Goliath, Cap vs. Wrecker and finally Cap vs. Baron Zemo. A lesser artist, thinking he's the next-Kirby, would have drawn the whole thing in a loose, in-your-face, full page splash, zero storytelling style. But not Buscema and Palmer. See their art here and you'll know why Buscema was THE Marvel artist of the 1970s and 80s.	2004-02-18

This book reads like a weird nightmare. Everything is so crazy that it's almost unreal - like something in the back of your mind telling you that this just can't be happening!<br />DC Comics took one real bold step with Hal Jordan in the early 1990s. They made him crazy and evil. Ever since the 1985-6 \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", they have been killing off the Silver Age heroes and replacing them with new versions. Barry Allen was replaced by Wally West, Oliver Queen was replaced by Connor Hawke, Superman was (temporarily) replaced by FOUR new versions of the character (don't ask!), Batman was (also temporarily) replaced by Azrael and later Dick Grayson and finally Hal Jordan was replaced by Kyle Rayner (of which the tale is told in this volume).<br />The most controversial of all the \\"replacements\\" and \\"revamps\\" was the Hal Jordan-Kyle Rayner thing. You see, all the other replacement were either temporary (Supes, Bats and even Green Arrow is now back) or the original died heroically (as in the case of Barry Allen). With Green Lantern, sales was so low that they needed a really HUGE event to shake things up - so they had Hal Jordan go crazy, slaughter all the other GLs, the Guardians, destroyed Oa and become a super-powerful cosmic villain called Parallax. Ron Marz, the original scripter of these tales (he's not the one really responsible for the whole thing - it was an editorial decision!), have been receiving death threats and insults from fans (mostly unreasonable) ever since. My reaction is like that of the other reviewer - WHY THE EXTREME REACTION?<br />Granted, I like Hal Jordan a whole lot! Look, I even created an Amazon List on everything Hal! And after reading the recent Mark Waid penned \\"The Brave and the Bold\\" TPB, I too wished that Hal Jordan is still Green Lantern. But then, I like the evolution of the character even more. And I like the idea of Hal Jordan as Parallax (and now as the new Spectre). In short, I like change. And finally, I'm beginning to like the new GL, Kyle Rayner, a whole lot too.<br />Now to the stories in this volume. They were previously collected in TWO separate volumes - \\"Emerald Twilight\\" and \\"A New Dawn\\". DC recently rereleased the two stories in one volume along with the \\"Emerald Dawn\\" and \\"The Road Back\\" volumes to form a series with a similar cover-design. Therefore, this current volume consist of issues 48 to 55 of the Green Lantern comics and includes an Afterword by Ron Marz. I rather enjoy the reading the story in one sitting (although I'd recommend reading \\"The Return of Superman\\" TPB before this one to understand the background behind Hal's descent into madness). My only complain is that they should have made the \\"Emerald Twilight\\" story longer. It was a major milestone in a character's life and he only had THREE ISSUES? Then you have FIVE ISSUES of melodrama and soap opera with Kyle Rayner discovering his new powers as the new GL? The whole collection feels rather uneven because of this. The pacing for the first part is too fast and too crammed and the later part is too loose.<br />Ron Marz's writing is passable and Kyle Rayner is still largely undeveloped in this volume. Get \\"Baptism of Fire\\" (the next volume) to see how Marz develops this new GL. The artwork is overall very good - especially the chapters by Darryl Banks and Bill Willingham. Finally, it's always great seeing another appearance by Alan Scott, the original Golden Age GL, giving some pointers to the new GL!

I wished this book had come out sooner when I was just finding my way around the modern Batman comics. Nevertheless, better late than never.<br />A word of caution. If you are looking for the DEFINITIVE guide to everything Batman, I wouldn't recommend this book to you. Les Daniels' book on Batman is by far the most comprehensive treatment on the whole history of the Batman from his pre-conception in the 1930s up till the recent stuff (including his incarnations outside the comicbook - TV, toys, cinema, etc.). Also, if you're interested in analyzing Batman as a pop-culture icon, you should check out Will Brookner's &quot;Batman Unmasked&quot; book. Finally, if you're interested in reading a one-volume collection of the definitive Batman - I'd recommend Frank Miller's &quot;Dark Knight Returns&quot; and/or &quot;Year One&quot; along with the &quot;The Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told&quot;.<br />What then is this book by Scott Beatty about? It's about the modern day Batman. THIS Batman is as different from the classic Bob Kane/Bill Finger creation as the Tim Burton movies are from the Adam West TV show. For your information, THIS Batman is the one from Frank Miller's &quot;Year One&quot; (1986) and it includes the later revisions by Dennis O'Neil and Chuck Dixon up to today. In other words, this is the Batman of &quot;Knightfall&quot;, &quot;Contagion&quot;, &quot;Cataclysm&quot; and &quot;No Man's Land&quot;. And in my opinion, this is the most exciting and rich version of the Batman since his conception in 1939. This book is not so much a guide but more a celebration of this modern-day Dark Knight of the comicbooks.<br />The book is neatly divided into sections. The first section is about Batman/Bruce Wayne and Gotham City. The second section covers his allies and loves (Alfred, Gordon, Nightwing, Oracle, Robin II, Robin III, etc.). The third section focuses on the many colorful villains in the Bat-mythos. Finally, there's also a foreword by Chuck Dixon, the man who, under the editorial-eye of Dennis O'Neil, pretty much shaped the direction of the Bat-books throughout the 1990s. Note: Dixon also teamed up with the author Scott Beatty on some other great works like the recent &quot;Robin: Year One&quot; and &quot;Batgirl: Year One&quot;.ord by Chuck Dixon, the man who, under the editorial-eye of Dennis O'Neil, pretty much shaped the direction of the Bat-books throughout the 1990s.

The two &quot;Crisis&quot; volumes collect the justly-classic JLA/JSA crossovers from 1960 to 1970 reminding younger readers about the annual events of the two groups meetings in the Silver Age. All that however, ended in 1985 with Crisis on Infinite Earths. This present volume by Geoff Johns, David Goyer, Carlos Pacheco and Jesus Merino attempts to revive that grand tradition. <br />The current members of both teams JLA and JSA decide to meet for Thanksgiving, they take down a villain together and end up in another meeting at the JSA Museum. This is where everything goes crazy! Team members started acting all weird... suffice to say, events take on a global-cataclysmic-level and the &quot;still-normal&quot; members of both teams are thrown all over the place (Limbo, Fate's Crossroads Tower, etc.). They then brought in all the &quot;reserve members&quot; like Black Canary, Green Arrow, Firestorm, Zatanna, etc. to save the day. So you can imagine the number of characters artists Carlos Pacheco and Jesus Merino have to draw! And boy did they do a bang-up job with the art. Detailed, yet clear. Clean-lines, realistic renderings of hair, clothing, wrinkles, etc. yet with a Byrne-like sense of cartooning fun. As for the writing, I would say that Goyer and Johns do far better-writing on their monthly JSA title than here. Sure, there are many &quot;cool character-moments&quot; and the threat here is big but nothing like the kind of energy you get from their monthly title. Like another reviewer mention, this story is good but not great. My advice, get it in softcover rather than hardcover. The paper quality in the softcover is very good (unlike the usually very-thin paper used in other DC collections). But GET it, nonetheless. This book marks a return to the great annual tradition of JLA/JSA meetings... and I say it's about time!	2004-02-08

Most of the time, they are so overblown and crazy that you just have to wonder what the writers were smoking at the time he wrote them. And they don't come quirkier or more outrageous than Jim Starlin and his 70's &quot;cosmic-co-horts&quot;, Al Milgrom and Steve Englehart.<br />This TPB reprints the best of Starlin's run on Captain Marvel in the 70's (originally reprinted in &quot;The Life of Captain Marvel&quot;) and the Graphic Novel (also by Starlin) &quot;The Death of Captain Marvel&quot;. Oh yes, the first appearance of Thanos (Iron Man #55) is also included here - for those who love the rocky-faced Titan from all those &quot;Infinity&quot; crossovers! The high-points of this collection include the tale of Captain Marvel's acquiring &quot;cosmic-awareness/consciousness&quot;, the Thanos War (involving the Cosmic Cube, the Titans and the Avengers) and finally the poignant story of Cap's death by cancer.<br />Read this and savour the delight of cosmic Marvel comics. They just don't make them like this anymore! And if you want more of the same, check out &quot;Avengers:Kree-Skrull War&quot;, &quot;Avengers:Celestial Madonna&quot;, &quot;Avengers Forever&quot; and &quot;Infinity Gauntlet&quot;.	2004-01-27

Especially the Jim Starlin stories (available in &quot;The Life &amp; Death of Captain Marvel&quot; TPB). There is a sense of the writer taking the stories a little too seriously - they are usually overwritten, overblown, pseudo-Shakespearean, outrageous and quirky... but they work! There is an overall appeal to the 1970s stories that are missing from today's comics.<br />Here, we have Peter David, fresh off his decade-long stint on the Hulk, attempting to write about the heir to the Captain Marvel legacy - Genis (who is again merged with Rick Jones just like his daddy was). This series is an offshoot from the excellent &quot;Avengers Forever&quot; maxi-series by Kurt Busiek and Carlos Pacheco. I read that first and immediately followed that with this volume. The change in tone is striking! While Busiek tried his best to write in the &quot;classic&quot; Marvel style reminiscent of Steve Englehart and Jim Shooter, Peter David is more a &quot;modern&quot; Marvel writer (though still staying short of the self-important, no-continuity Nu-Marvel or Ultimate-Marvel these days). He throws in pop-references left and right and overwrites the humour in this book. That is the main difference between the humour in the past and the humour today. In the past, you laugh because the concepts are genuinely silly but still takes itself seriously. Today's writers (like Peter David here) points at the silliness and then proceeds to tell you that you are reading something very silly... thus killing much of the appeal of the character and stories. <br />However, having said all that, I did enjoy this volume quite a lot. And that probably has more to do with my love for the characters Rick Jones and Moondragon than with the quality of the writing. Drax the Destroyer, a grim fighting-machine from the 1970s Starlin stories is shown here as no more than a silly, whiny buffoon - totally out-of-character. The stories are generally light-hearted and easy-reading. I was told that there is more depth in the latter stories following this volume but I wouldn't know because I haven't read them.<br />The highlight of this volume, however, is the art. Chriscross is a genuinely innovative and expressive artist. And his style blends in very well with Peter David's writing. Then there is the fill-in issue drawn by Ron Lim, the legendary cosmic-artist (Silver Surfer, Infinity Gauntlet, etc.). After having him on the title, you wish he'll stay on forever.	2004-01-27

Having said all that, the average comic fan is actually far more intelligent than most people think. I mean, the world is only now discovering things like the \\"Matrix\\" films and these are things that comic readers have taken for granted for years. <br />I, and many like me, have been \\"seduced\\" by the intellectually satisfying and literary rich writings of post-modern comic scribes like Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Grant Morrison and Warren Ellis. These masters of deconstructionist, post-modern writing always seem to come up with new ways of reinventing the entire comic genre. However, all that said, there is still that part of me that is a lot less cerebral and a lot more visceral... or more romantic. It's that part of me that gasp with bated breath when Green Lantern takes his oath or when the Batman swoops down unto the roof of the GCPD in answer to Commissioner Gordon's call. And for that, I turn to Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee's \\"Batman : Hush\\".<br />Jeph Loeb doesn't pretend to be what he's not. He's not from the fraternity of \\"2000 A.D.\\" British writers who deconstructs superheroes to show them for the fascists they really are. Jeph Loeb is a romantic - of the \\"Casablanca\\" sort. He loves superheroes and it shows in his works (check out \\"Superman For All Seasons\\" and his Marvel \\"color\\" books for further evidence). And here in \\"Hush\\", we have Loeb writing a story that I believe he himself wanted to read. All the best writers write for themselves... for their own pleasure rather than for the approval of a board of critics. In short, Loeb writes as a fellow fan to fellow fans who want to see a great Batman-Superman bout, a Batman-Catwoman romance, a Batman-Joker fight-to-the-death, etc. - you get the point! More than that, he writes for the artist. In this case, Jim Lee. Jeph Loeb is as much a fan of Lee as many of us. So he writes the scenes that he himself (and mostof us) wants to see Jim bring to glorious life with his pencils. For example, who doesn't want to see Poison Ivy drawn by Jim Lee? <br />That brings us to the artist. Need I tell you that Jim Lee is the creator of the highest-selling comicbook of all time (X-Men #1)? Need I tell you that Jim Lee is the founder of Wildstorm? But more important than that, we respect the man for his art - which can be summed up as merely a strong sense of the human figure and tight, super-detailed backgrounds. Having grown up with his work on X-Men and Punisher, I must say that he has improved greatly here on Batman, giving us (dare I say it) the most definitive Batman since Neal Adams in the 1970s. All that is brought to glorious life by the tight inking work of frequent collaborator Scott Williams and colorist Alex Sinclair.<br />This first of two volumes collects the first five parts of the Hush storyline along with an introductory \\"origin\\" of Batman told from Alfred's perspective. Jeph Loeb provides the foreword himself and the book includes biographies of the creators. I gave it four stars instead of five because the paper is awfully thin. Seeing that this is a hardcover collection of the highest-selling comic of 2003, D.C. should have used a heavier paper-stock - like they did on the wonderful Green Arrow hardcovers. <br />All in all, I recommend this book for those who grew up with Batman and those who would like a taste of the \\"real\\" Batman apart from the awful movies.	2004-01-02

This large hardcover collects the Daredevil Graphic Novel (Love and War) as well as the entire Elektra Assassin series. Both stories were written by Frank Miller and illustrated by Bill Sienkiewicz. <br />I missed reading these stories when they first came out in the 1980s but I'd heard so much about the great Miller-Sienkiewicz collaborations that I just had to get this book. The bonus is that you get the glorious Sienkiewicz art in a much larger size here than in the original - so you can spend hours poring over all the details. After all, this is the work that made Bill Sienkiewicz into, well... BILL SIENKIEWICZ!<br />The \\"Love and War\\" story is essentially about Kingpin and his wife, Vanessa. For those who have followed the storylines in Frank Miller's Daredevil comics (collected in the 3 volume Visionaries tradepaperbacks), you'll know that Vanessa went through a hell of a mental ordeal - finally reducing her to a vegetable. This is the follow-up story for those wondering how the Kingpin-Vanessa story went. This story, more than any other, shows Kingpin as a human who CAN be hurt... and hurt deeply. Not by do-gooder superheroes but by love. Sienkiewicz illustrates this story in a lyrical yet surreal fashion. The scenes showing Daredevil cradling Vanessa while jumping across the rooftops are so poetic and lyrical that you'll cry reading them.<br />\\"Elektra Assassin\\" is the real MEAT of this hardcover collection, though. Daredevil doesn't appear in this. It's all about Elektra and this secret agent. Miller mixes in Japanese mysticism, political paranoia, Greek tragedy, shadow-play espionage, gender issues, sex, violence, claustrophobic mind-games, media manipulation and the Biblical apocalypse into this story. Sienkiewicz takes the whole witch-brew and hammers the whole thing into form. The result is a heady trip... an experience, an encounter with a dangerous woman who may be the only one who knows what the hell is going on - and how to FIX it. This is the greatest example of comics-experimentation in the 1980s (Dark Knight Returns and Watchmen are the other examples).	2003-12-29

Time was when comics meant seeing characters in colourful costumes spouting macho nonsense and punching each other out. This book here showed me otherwise. And introduced me to new worlds of reading and the imagination!<br />The original Starman is Theodore (Ted) Knight. He appeared in comics around 1941. This here story, however, is about his sons, David Knight and Jack Knight. David inherited his father's costume and took over the family superhero business. Jack is cynical about his roots and moved on to become a junk-peddler! An old nemesis of the Starman, the Mist, shows up with his own children and waged war on the Knights - injuring Ted and killing David. Jack is then forced to reluctantly take up his father's mantle.<br />This first volume of the Starman paperbacks help the reader get into the setting of Opal City (beautifully designed in an art deco style by artist Tony Harris) and its many residents - the Knight family, the O'Dare family of cops, the Shade, the Mist family, a fortune teller, etc. The reader does not need any background knowledge of Golden Age comics to enjoy this - although, like me, you may want to track down the old comics in the Archive Editions just to get more into the history of it all. After all, Starman is ultimately about history. History and family. This is, to me, the most human comic in the world. You'll laugh and cry with the Knights. And you'll grow with Jack. And speaking of Jack...<br />James Robinson has done an absolutely amazing job creating Jack Knight. In many ways, James IS Jack - and in other sense, we all are Jack (we, as in, all those who grew up in from the materialistic '80s into the cynical '90s). Jack is about finding the old values without looking campy or sounding corny. Jack is about making being a hero without necessarily having to wear spandex. Jack is about clinging on to everything you love - whether it be junk or family legacy. Finally, Jack is about romance - the romanceof chivalry and standing up for what's right.<br />Read this book. Get the rest of the volumes. And let's revisit the Golden Age.....	2003-12-07

I have always made it a habit to tell people about the DC Archive Edition reprints of Golden Age comicbooks. They are a veritable MIRACLE! Without them, it would have been impossible for me to ever read comicbooks from the 1930s and 1940s. You see, time was when comicbooks were not dutifully collected and kept in Mylar bags like today. In fact, they were little more than &quot;read-once-then-use-for-fish-wrappers&quot;. More than this, many of these Golden Age comics had very low print runs and were printed on inferior paper due to the paper shortage during the War Years. The DC Archive Editions therefore exist to collect these gems of American Pop-Culture into durable and elegant reprint editions for us today.<br />The second volume of the Golden Age Green Lantern Archives gives us more stories of Alan Scott (Green Lantern) and his bumbling sidekick, Doiby Dickles. We see in this volume a more confident Alan Scott, who is a lot more comfortable in his role as a mystery-man who helps out. The highlights of this volume are the great, epic four-parters (from GL#2 and GL#3). Book-length stories were very uncommon in the Golden Age. Usually editors get their writers/artists to produce short stories that are usually kept in drawers as &quot;reserved-material&quot;. And usually a comic book is made up of four such short stories. Therefore, the editor has a lot of freedom packing in stories from his &quot;reserved-material&quot; should a writer/artist fail to turn in stories in any given month. However, the rare book-length epics (like those collected here) really allows the writer and artist to strut their stuff. Bill Finger and Mart Nodell gives us a great crime mystery in GL#2 and a whimsical adventure to an El-Dorado-like paradise in GL#3. <br />Other highlights of this volume includes Doiby Dickles discovering GL's secret identity for the first time. The battle against the modern-day Napoleon is collected here also (this is where we learn that Alan Scott's middle nameis Wellington). We also see Alan and Irene's first kiss. Overall, the stories in this volume should bring a smile and an occasional tear to you as you read them. They are so simple and yet so endearing.<br />Irwin Hasen is the regular artist on the All-American comics collected here while Martin Nodell is busy turning in all those four-parter book-length stories in GL#2 and #3. The foreword to this volume is written by that pioneer of Golden Age Fandom, Jerry Bails.	2003-12-04
US	52496057	R14PX4P9YQHE01	1563894750	906475997	Green Lantern: Emerald Knights	Books	4	13	13	N	N	The GL Version of &quot;Return of Barry Allen&quot;!	The most wonderful (as well as most over-exploited) thing about DC Comics is the long history of the characters. For example, we have the Golden Age Green Lantern, Alan Scott (who first debuted in 1940) and the Silver Age Green Lantern, Hal Jordan (1959) and finally the current Green Lantern, Kyle Rayner (1994). That's not to mention the other GLs like the 1970s John Stewart and the obnoxious (but cuddly!!) Guy Gardner. Same thing with the Flashes (Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, Wally West). <br />The usual view of comic creators and readers are somewhat like this: The Golden Age gave us the original concept, the Silver Age gave us the penultimate version of the character and the Modern Age version is either a farce or a personification of the fan-boy's hero-worship for the Silver Age version. Case in point, Wally West, the current Flash - who is often portrayed as the substitute for the comic-fan who learn his &quot;values&quot; and &quot;life-lessons&quot; by emulating the oh-so-great Silver Age Flash, Barry Allen. We finally got to see Barry and Wally together in Mark Waid's now-classic &quot;Return of Barry Allen&quot; tale. In a way, Wally's Flash is &quot;legitimized&quot; by Barry's approval of him at the end of the tale. <br />Kyle Rayner, the current GL, however suffered the abuse of comic-readers who constantly call him a farce and pretender. Looking at the character objectively, I have to say that Kyle suffered because of the fate of his predecessor than through any fault of his own. You see, his predecessor, the beloved Hal Jordan went crazy and became this villain called Parallax (long story - in short, the readers were none too pleased!). Long-time readers took out their frustration on Hal's replacement, Kyle - even to the fanatical level of forming a Jihad-like group called H.E.A.T. to insist that D.C. Comics reinstate Hal as the &quot;one and only REAL Green Lantern&quot;. This volume here is another &quot;Return of Barry Allen&quot;-like response by D.C.to &quot;legitimize&quot; Kyle Rayner. Did they succeed? Well, the results are pretty predictable. Hal shows up in Kyle's present-time. They go through several adventures together and meet up with a few &quot;old&quot; friends like the JLA, the current Green Arrow and the other &quot;ring-bearers&quot;. Kyle feeling like the fifth wheel now that Hal is welcomed back (you'll never guess who comes to &quot;comfort&quot; him!). And finally an encounter with the Parallax from Zero Hour (don't ask!!). Ends with Hal saying how &quot;happy and proud&quot; he is of Kyle (there... the &quot;legitimizing&quot; moment) and Kyle &quot;knowing&quot; that Hal will always be that measure of a hero that he aspire to. Nothing overtly deep or anything here.<br />&quot;Emerald Knights&quot; is really a simple, fond farewell to the Hal Jordan that we knew and loved. It doesn't really change anything. Except Kyle maybe. The past few years, we have seen Kyle getting &quot;recognition&quot; from the JLA, the other Green Lanterns, etc. We finally get to see him meeting the &quot;real&quot; Hal Jordan and see how he measures up. I don't think this story did much to appease the H.E.A.T. (I just HAD to say that!). But for a reader like me, I'm pretty happy that they did a story like that. It shows how much these characters are loved and the affection that both the creators and readers still have for them. I am neither a H.E.A.T. supporter nor a Kyle supporter. I just like the way things have progressed so far. Kyle IS the Green Lantern. Alan Scott is Sentinel of JSA (recently started calling himself G.L. again!) and Hal is performing his &quot;penance&quot; as the Spectre (see &quot;Day of Judgment&quot; miniseries).	2003-12-04

These two volumes are the most beautiful hardcover comics that I've ever seen (and I've got quite a lot of hardcover comics myself!). This volume collects issues 11 to 15 from Kevin Smith's run on the title.<br />After establishing the resurrection of Green Arrow (Ollie Queen) in the previous story, we see him adjusting to his new life here. He deals with his fatherhood issues (with son Connor Hawke) and goes out on a date with his one-great-love, Black Canary (Dinah Lance) - a \\"first\\" date that went a little too far! Finally, we have the appearance of a new enemy who is more than a match for Ollie - the Onomatopoeia, a psychotic villain that we still know very little of (except that he's obsessed about \\"sounds\\" when he kills vigilantes).<br />Two complaints. Firstly, too many \\"oral sex\\" references!!! And secondly, the book is so good but it leads to the anti-climax of the century (no, that is not another oral sex reference!). We end the book knowing next to nothing about this new killer, Onomatopoeia. And to date, the story is still unresolved. I do hope that Kevin Smith comes back and resolve it one day.<br />Overall, like the first volume, this is an excellent comic. It is also the end of Kevin's run on this title. Although the excellent art team of Phil Hester and Ande Parks are still sticking around with the next writer Brad Meltzer (check out Volume 3 : The Archer's Quest).	2003-11-14
US	52496057	R3Q3CA1QTPHUFO	1563898020	583757422	Green Arrow: Quiver	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Welcome To The Resurrection	Unless you have been living under a rock for the past five years or so, you would know that Kevin Smith is one up-and-rising film director and comic book writer. While I've generally enjoyed his films and his comic books quite a bit, I think the attention (worship and adoration is more like it) given him is really a little above what a mortal should be receiving! Seriously, I like the man a lot for his wit and his obvious gift for dialogue. But not all the fawning over him! Check out his View Askew website or any issue of Wizard Magazine for all the endless fawning over the man. Yuck! OK. Having gotten all that out, let me move on to an objective review of his Green Arrow work.<br />Firstly, we see the writer and artists really having fun with this work. Their obvious joy in turning out the pages are so infectious that you feel it as a reader. This is obviously the work of fans who totally love the title character, Oliver Queen. That's not a bad thing. In fact, I think one of the reasons comic characters grow boring and old is because they are usually assigned to work-for-hire creators who have no more passion for writing the book. Not the case here. Kevin, Phil and Ande loves the book.<br />The story starts out with a really good &quot;prologue&quot; chapter introducing the dramatis personae (so that even someone with little prior knowledge of Green Arrow can get into the story). Then it hits the reader with a punch in a last page appearance of a haggard, dirty and smelly Oliver Queen (who was believed dead for several years already!). Then we are treated to a Rip Van Winkle take on the character who is slowly trying to piece together his life (he still thinks it's the 1970s!!!). The greatest thing with this story is really the intimate conversations Ollie has with his bewildered friends and family - Hal Jordan, Black Canary, Connor Hawke, Roy Harper, and the JLA. Kevin Smith puts every bit of his genius with dialogue into all these scenes. You'll laugh and cry with the characters. You know they are still comic-book characters but then they are comic-book characters who have grown with you over the years... almost like close friends. This is also the first time I read a &quot;resurrection&quot; story in a comic without feeling cheated. <br />My one complaint is in the characterization of Mia. She's a 15 year old who was raped by her father and then her &quot;uncle&quot; and then sent out on the streets to be a prostitute. I was expecting the liberal, social-conscious Green Arrow to take up her case and make a big deal out of it (the 1970s Dennis O'Neil version would have). But then we are treated to one rescue scene and in the next chapter, she simply comes across as just another smart-talking girl with no emotional scars at all. I mean, this kind of thing scars a person for life - what more a 15 year-old. It's this kind of writing that makes comic-book lose its &quot;realism&quot; and prevent it from gaining the respect it should garner. I've always thought that while the superhero genre allows all kinds of mind-blowing, out-of-this-world antics, the characterization and emotions and personalities should always be as &quot;real&quot; and &quot;identifiable&quot; as possible. That's what makes fantasy potent - otherwise, it's just unreal nonsense. Maybe Kevin was too caught up with writing all the reunion scenes. Maybe he was putting in too many cameos in the story (the Phantom Stranger appearance is really quite needless). Or maybe he was just having too much fun and didn't want to get into the overtly &quot;dark&quot; themes like child-rape and child-prostitution. I think that would have made a powerful theme, though. Here we have this girl who was abused, and we also have another kid who is abused by the villain of the story for occultic motives and we have Green Arrow, who was never much of a good father himself. These themes could have been tied up together more seriously to make a stronger and more potent story.<br />Complaints aside. This is really a very good comic-book. And the production values for this hardcover version is the best I've seen so far. Phil Hester and Ande Parks did great work with their slightly cartoony but very energetic art. And Alex Sinclair's colours make everything beautiful here just like he did over on Jim Lee's Batman. Finally, it's a great feeling that Oliver Queen, the original Green Arrow, is alive and well... and in good creative hands.	2003-11-14

Never got to read the original story when it was published in 1989-90. Over the years I have heard many people saying that this was a lousy series and that Hal Jordan (Green Lantern) is grossly out-of-character and a destructive alcoholic. Untrue. I think most people who dislike this series are people who love the original Broome and Kane GL stories from the late 1950s and 1960s. In other words, these other reviewers are too bound by their loyalty to their nostalgia - although those early GL tales are a gem! &quot;Emerald Dawn&quot;, however, is a Green Lantern origin story more fitting for a more sophisticated time. Hal Jordan, far from being out-of-character, is finally a &quot;character&quot;. We identify with his foibles, his failures and finally his metamorphoses into a true hero - and the greatest GL ever. We also get to see his first meeting with the GL Corps and the Guardians. Finally, the alcoholic thing? He got drunk ONCE during a particular bad time and caused an accident! That doesn't make Hal an alcoholic - he's no Tony Stark!	2003-11-13

This story is ultimately about responsibility. Hal Jordan takes responsibility for his failings (recounted in Emerald Dawn) and goes to prison. There he meets a fellow convict Willie and a pre-machismo Guy Gardner!<br />The highlight of this story however, is SINESTRO. This story shows Sinestro training Hal to be a Green Lantern who believes in order. It also recounts Sinestro's tragic fall from grace - for taking his responsibilities a little too fanatically. This foreshadows Hal's later fall for the same reasons. The original Silver Age Sinestro was a little two-dimensional as a villain. Here, with the added teacher-disciple ties with Hal and the story of his fall, we have a Sinestro that we can understand (and perhaps even symphatize with).<br />I do not understand the many complains about Giffen and Jones in Emerald Dawn I and II. These two stories served to &quot;humanize&quot; the otherwise 2D-characterizations of Hal Jordan and Sinestro. In view of Marvel's recent &quot;Ultimate&quot; versions of their characters, these two TPBs stands as the &quot;Ultimate&quot; version of DC's Green Lantern.	2003-11-13

Marsten is also the inventor of the lie detector and the creator of the original Golden Age Wonder Woman.<br />One thing that I especially like about the stories in this volume is how most of them are about &quot;real&quot; issues and crime. No super-villains here. No cosmic mumbo-jumbo. Just a person with a gift of power who wants to be helpful to the public. In the 1970s, Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams came up with a series of &quot;Relevance&quot; stories starring the Silver Age Green Lantern and Green Arrow. Those stories were considered revolutionary because by then comics was all about fighting the super-villain of the month. Suddenly, there were stories about real crime, corruption, drugs, religious fanatics and the sort. But then, &quot;Relevance&quot; stories have always been in comics in the 1940s. Especially these Bill Finger penned classics here. Moreover, they appear less &quot;forced&quot; here than in the 1970s works (although I love those Hard-Travelling Heroes stories a lot also).<br />Interestingly, Alan Scott is still a vital character in today's comics, appearing constantly in the current Green Lantern and JSA series in his original persona (unlike the revamped Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman). Today, he appears very much as a guide and a source of wisdom for the new generation of heroes. Reading about his heroic exploits in these early stories, it's not difficult to see that he is more than qualified to guide us all today to higher aspirations.	2003-11-08

Mark Waid and Barry Kitson made me a believer in the Silver Age characters with this book. I've always been a Golden Age and Modern Age comic fan. For some reason or other, I'd never gotten around to reading the Silver Age John Broome creations (namely, Hal Jordan's Green Lantern and Barry Allen's Flash). This book changed all that.<br />Mark Waid understands these characters very well. And he writes their unlikely friendship very well indeed - even surpassing, in some ways, the Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams pairing of Green Lantern with Green Arrow in the 1970s. For the guest-stars, we have the Golden Age Flash (Jay Garrick) and Green Lantern (Alan Scott) putting in an appearance to guide or &quot;build a bridge&quot; with their Silver Age counterparts. And it's always neat to see another Hard-Travelling Heroes tale (drawn eerily like Neal Adams by Tom Grindberg). Fan-fave villains, Sinestro and the Star Sapphire also appears, rounding up this collection of tales.<br />Finally, I love the way Waid sums up the characters' chemistry with each other : Hal admires the Flash's freedom and Barry's discipline. Barry admires the Green Lantern's discipline and Hal's freedom. They sort of complement each other in their dual identities and makes the pairing a lot richer. I wished this story never ended...	2003-11-08

It is largely written by Karl Kesel (an inker who trained himself to write) and drawn by Stuart Immonen (whose art improved leaps and bounds AFTER this story). Ron Marz put in his best written Hal Jordan story and Mike McKone's earlier art in this book shows how much he's improved today in books like Exiles and Teen Titans (he used to draw all his characters with very short legs!!!).<br />Anyway, on to the story itself. The plot and main story about an entity(?) called the Sun-Eater about to devour the sun is pretty blah! All it does is set up the story of how all the DC superheroes, including a team up between the Legion's Brainiac-5 and Lex Luthor (in homage to Silver Age Brainiac-Luthor team-ups) failed to prevent the end of all existence as we know it. Then in comes Hal Jordan/Parallax. And the story starts to get REALLY good. Especially the part when Hal goes and make peace with all his loved ones before his final sacrifice (Guy Gardner, the late Ollie Queen, Tom &quot;Pieface&quot; Kamalku and Carol Ferris).<br />The last scene of Parallax triumphantly undo the effects of the Sun-Eater and recharge the sun while shouting out his oath, &quot;In Brightest Day, In Blackest Night...&quot; is an awesome sight to behold. And you'll never read the words of that oath in the same way after that. It's that kind of scene in mainstream comics that give you that kind of tingling feeling in your spine and makes you say &quot;WOW&quot;!	2003-11-08

Example, Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams introduced us to the Hard-Travelling Heroes pair of Green Lantern and Green Arrow. Here in this book, we have the pairing of the BIGGEST (no pun intended) icons of '90s video games and comic-book heroines - Tomb Raider and Witchblade - AKA Lara Croft and Sara Pezzini respectively.<br />The writing is really nothing to shout about. The plots are also paper-thin. This is the kind of story that makes people look down on the medium and pronounce it &quot;comic-booky&quot;. But the artwork by Michael Turner is worth the price of admission. Top Cow puts in a lot into their comic art - especially in the top-notch coloring to complement Turner's ultra-detailed pencils.<br />This book contains all the Tomb Raider-Witchblade Crossovers published so far (except the Fathom issues and the recent ENDGAME storyline). It also marks the first comic-book appearance of Lara Croft/Tomb Raider before she got her own series. Get this book if you like to see gorgeous girls hanging out and kill several demons while at it.	2003-10-25

I was nuts over his work on that former book. Beautiful women and ultra-detailed backgrounds. Then when he left that book, I was very upset for a long while....<br />That was until my Fathom Hardcover Deluxe Collected Edition arrived in the mail! His work here is better than ever. Even more fluid than his work in Witchblade - although I have to say that there are pieces in Witchblade that will remain very special to me. <br />Top Cow puts in the highest production quality into their comic-books. This book is the perfect example of holding a summer-blockbuster movie in your hands. The effect is really THAT mind-blowing. Bill O'Neil's writing is overly wordy at times and there are many hanging plotlines left at the end of this volume. But after the whole experience of reading this book, well, I don't think you'll care about all its faults. Ultimately, the book is about Aspen Matthew's search for her true identity - human or water-being, warrior or pacifist, princess or destroyer. <br />If you like the movie, &quot;The Abyss&quot;, you'll love this book.

Somehow, he was hampered by the fact that he was trying too hard to match up to Grant Morrison's New X-Men (something not humanly possible). IMHO, Casey's best writing was on Cable, Wildcats and here in this tiny little piece of gem - a retelling of who the X-Men are and how they came to be.<br />The original X-Men comic started around 1963 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The story begins with Prof. X mentally summoning his students to gather before him in their gaudy, '60s uniforms (not costumes). \\"Children of the Atom\\" serves as a prequel to the story in X-Men #1. Who were these people before they became students of Charles Xavier. <br />There is a \\"work-in-progress\\" kind of feel to the whole story. The mutant fear is only beginning, with its flames stoked by a very \\"American-History-X\\" cult leader. Both Xavier and Magneto appears to be busy preparing for the upcoming problems/war. But the highlight of the story has to be the original five students - Scott Summers, Hank McCoy, Bobby Drake, Warren Worthington and Jean Grey. Here, they are presented as flesh-and-blood CHILDREN. Not the iconic superheroes of the movie or the comics today. Scott is shown as an Oliver Twist character who stuggles with moral issues (he is shown reading Nietzsche's \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\"). Hank is a genius and intellectual but acts like the average \\"non-geeky\\" jock to be \\"accepted\\". Bobby stuggles with questions of identity and insecurity (it's not difficult to see the evolution of this insecure kid into the practical joker of the Xavier Alumni). Warren idolizes superheroes and long to be like them - his first outing as one got him hunted by a Sentinel, leading to a rude awakening that he can never be \\"just like a superhero\\" - he's ultimately a mutant. Jean is pure Jean - painfully gorgeous and vulnerable. <br />I love this work. For its humanity. For the writers obvious affection for these \\"children\\". And for Steve Rude'sclear, Kirbyesque art. Alas, Rude did not stay for the duration of the series. The last chapters were illustrated by Essad Ribic and Michael Ryan - good enough art but it'd be even more fulfilling had Rude completed the whole thing. Last but not least, a gold star to anyone who can spot the sly reference to Monica Lewinsky's mutant power in this book!!!	2003-10-20

Thinking that all their characters have become too archaic for the cutting-edged tastes of today's readers, they systematically set out to eliminate all their \\"old\\" characters and replace them with \\"new\\" characters. Thus we have all the big \\"events\\" of the 1990s - the \\"death\\" of Superman (to be replaced by FOUR Supermen - and finally the original returned with long hair), the \\"maiming\\" of Batman (to be replaced by a psychotic, badly-drawn Jean Paul Valley), the \\"defeat\\" of Wonder Woman and the \\"amputation\\" of Aquaman.<br />And there were the \\"events\\". Underworld Unleashed. Zero Hour. Final Night. Day of Judgment. Our Worlds At War. Joker's Last Laugh. etc. etc. Mega-crossovers that involve a million titles.<br />Here in this book, we have DC doing what DC should have been doing. Silver-Age storytelling with a modern sense of the epic. Goyer and Johns here stick to the \\"comic-characters-as-absurd-heroic-visions\\" view of past-writers like John Broome and Gardner Fox. There are no attempts here to force the characters to become unneccessarily \\"adult\\" ala' the pretentious Vertigo attempts. The characters here dress and talk like comic characters. And that's what they should always have been. And finally, no crossovers. The whole saga happened within ONE title - JSA.<br />Of course, as the title implies, Hawkman returns. And what an awe-inspiring scene that was. I still get that familiar tingle down my spine looking at that full-page blast of Carter Hall resurrected and proclaiming, \\"Arise, my once and future love!\\" And his return was just in time too. As the JSA then rush off to face Onimarr Synn.<br />Finally, there is that JSA meeting at the end of the story. Hawkman is back. And they do a little re-examination of what the JSA stands for - \\"Young Justice and the Titans, they look up to the Justice League. But the Justice League... they look up to US!\\" That's what the JSA is all about - LEGACY, what with being the original super-team in human history.<br />GET THIS BOOK!

Hawkman returns from oblivion in the &quot;Return of Hawkman&quot; JSA storyline only to find that the Hawkgirl of this incarnation doesn't even recognize him. She &quot;knows&quot; that he is her husband from all previous incarnations but she just doesn't &quot;feel&quot; that he is. That kind of corny stuff. But done right.

This is before the later, &quot;mature&quot; posturing armchair philosopher took over.

The opposite then, is also true, our modern society that cries out for OPTIMISM and &quot;positive-thinking&quot; is therefore the clearest sign that we are less than alive. This book is Nietzsche seeing in ART, that blazing passion for being ALIVE. This is Nietzsche as the young, unsystematic YEA-SAYER to LIFE. Aesthetics as the true metaphysics - not morality, since LIFE is beyond temporal, earthly taboos. ART-LIFE as the representation of transcending good and evil (later formulated more fully in &quot;Beyond Good And Evil&quot;. This is art seen under the lens of life.	2003-10-10

Mike Grell brings Olliver Queen (Green Arrow) back to his basic roots in this book. Green Arrow is not an easy character to write. Throughout his 50-60 year history, many attempts have failed - either too fancy or too sci/fi. The most memorable run seems to be Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams run during the 1970s during the &quot;Relevance&quot; period (in Green Lantern/Green Arrow). However, that era mixed Ollie in with too much sci-fi still - e.g. confrontations with the Guardians of Oa!!!<br />Mike Grell here strips Ollie down to reality. In fact, the book doesn't read like a superhero book at all. Ollie and Dinah (Black Canary) moves to Seattle (a real city unlike the fictional Star City or Gotham or Metropolis) and opens a flower shop (the aptly named Sherwood Florist). Then Dinah gets captured and tortured - she loses her Canary Cry and her ability to have children after this event. Ollie goes on a rampage against the bad guys - showing his new form as an &quot;urban hunter&quot;. And he meets up with Shado, a mysterious female archer, for the first time.<br />This book marks the beginning of a largely successful run of Green Arrow stories (mostly by Grell with other artists). However, looking back at it now, I think the book at times tries too hard to fit into the &quot;grim-'n-gritty&quot; mood so prevalent during the late 1980s (as a result of &quot;Dark Knight Returns&quot; and &quot;Watchmen&quot;). Lots of cruel violence, killings and some brief nudity.	2003-10-08

From a literary view, the book is weak - having a wife-killer... errr... &quot;wife-eater&quot; to be more exact, as a Raskolnikov-like character who later shows moments of real kindness (possible redemption?) just doesn't work.

They hardly had anything to back up the real-world success of the movie. As the movie premiered and went on to box-office success, the X-Men comicbooks were at its lowest ebb. In fact, the comicbooks were so bad and confusing that even long-time readers like me were thoroughly turned off. The good news is that Marvel is determined not to make the same mistake when they release a sequel to the X-Men movie in maybe 2003-4 by putting a lot of work to the X-Men titles even as we speak.<br />Ultimate X-Men is a title aimed at the general public - meaning the non-comic reading public. President Bill Jemas and Editor-In-Chief Joe Quesada came up with the Ultimate Marvel line retelling stories of familiar characters like Spiderman and X-Men without the baggage of over 35 years of continuity. It took the comicbook world by storm (the success of this venture to introduce comics to the general public remains to be seen). I think the reason it worked was because they put top-notch talents on the two Ultimate books. You've got Brian Michael Bendis writing Spiderman and here you have Mark Millar, just after a successful stint writing The Authority, writing Ultimate X-Men... plus, Adam Kubert's art never looked better than it does here. The overall feeling was like... well, if the X-Men were only created in 2001, this is how they would have been like.<br />From all that I've said, I seem to be implying that years of continuity is a bad thing. Not necessary. I was attracted to the X-Men because of the continuity. Every puzzling plotline opened up doors to other more interesting plotlines. It took me years to finally get a firm grasp on all the intricacies of the storylines. Even so, from someone who take continuity as seriously as I do, I still enjoy Ultimate X-Men a great deal. I liked it because of its fresh take on the characters that I've grown to be a little too familiar with. Here you have a Cyclops who doubtsProfessor X's noble ideals. Here you see Wolverine as a traitor and seducer. Here you see Jean Grey as a young and spunky doctor and mutation-expert. How cool is that? At the same time, we are also served with the ingredients that made us love the X-Men all this while (but with a more intelligent twist) - the philosophical rivalry between Xavier and Magneto, the love-triangle of Logan-Jean-Scott, the very &quot;real&quot; persecution of people-who-are-different and the non-stop action (like when Magneto drops a TRAIN on a group of Croatians bent on killing the X-Men!!!).<br />For a new comic reader or someone interested in the X-Men after watching the movie, this is a pretty good place to start. For a long-time reader like me, this place offers some familiar characters and plot-lines written in a rather unfamiliar, fresh and exciting manner. Try it.	2001-07-28

It is a sad thing that people today seems to prefer the findings of the Social Historians over the Intellectual Historians. For example, the Reformation is today analysed by many from the perspectives of economic pressures, political climate and social conditioning when the most crucial perspective of analysis should be centered upon the &quot;Battle of Ideas&quot;.<br />This book seeks to do just that. Steinmetz shows Luther as someone born to Theology as much as Bach was born to Music! More than that, Steinmetz's Luther is a fighter - a wrestler! Like Jacob of old, here we see Luther contending with his &quot;contemporaries&quot; - by that I mean the characters and ideas that more than any social concerns or pressures occupied his thoughts and demanded an appropriate response. We see Luther versus Abraham, Luther versus Isaiah, Luther versus Paul, Luther versus Augustine, Luther versus Ockham, Luther versus Erasmus and ultimately we see Luther versus himself and Luther versus God!<br />In short, we see Luther's beliefs as the product of conflict/crisis - much unlike the convenient/functional sort we see in many today. Reading this book allows me to see many Lutheran doctrines with far greater clarity than ever - e.g. the Hidden God, the Bondage of the Will, etc. I see Luther as someone like Jacob in the Book of Genesis holding on to the LORD, clinging on for his dear life! Then I see Luther limping away after his fights... a better man, a defeated man, a victorious man, a rebel and a worshipper.

Actually, bookshops around here hardly carry any good theology books with substance.

Again, that's that.<br />Now on to the book itself:<br />Althaus have always been recognised as providing us with the standard textbook on Luther's Theology. In some ways, many (myself included) prefer reading Althaus' Luther than Luther's Luther! What I mean is this - Luther's writings covered such a large spectrum of differing theological perspectives and here, Althaus synthesizes his writings under appropriate subject headings to let the readers see how Luther's mind works. But instead of merely giving the readers his own views on those same subjects, Althaus includes thousands of quotations direct from Luther's writings and sermons (thus allowing Luther himself to speak to the reader - albeit in a more systematic manner!).<br />Highly recommended primer on Luther. Read this first. Then seek out the actual works of Luther.	2001-01-06

Today he is still one of the most well-known and loved authors in the English language - with more of his books and sermons in print (over 100 years) than any other English writer. However, I am not endorsing his works simply because of his popularity or any man's for that matter. I am recommending the works of this man because he is one who listens to God.<br />The Treasury of David is Spurgeon's Magnum Opus. If he had not written anything else apart from this masterful commentary on the Psalms, he would still be considered among the greatest Christian writers of all history. Students of the life of Spurgeon would know that he was not a strict academician. However, in all sense of the word, he was a man of learning who was acquainted with much of the scholarly issues of his times. Ultimately, he was a man who listen to God and labored for God's honor among men. This Treasury is the supreme monument to his 21 year labor.<br />In the compiling of this Treasury, Spurgeon read up hundreds of theological texts and commentaries (much of which was quoted among his own notes and comments). In the original edition, Spurgeon also included his &quot;Notes to the Village Preacher&quot; on every Psalm - showing that Spurgeon will always be very important to anyone who wishes to speak from the Pulpit. I believe, however, that the worth of this book is even more for the lay student (Spurgeon's heart beats for them the most throughout his life). He attempted to share with them the best scholarship of his time and to lead them beyond scholarship to the worship of David's God. Reading this volume led me into worship of the same God - and I will never recover from Him! I exult in Him!<br />We will see, as many other readers have seen that the greatest treasures of the ancient Israelite Kingdom was not the Temple that Solomon built, the gold and harem that the kings acquired nor even the Ark of the Covenant (that so many modern authors are speculating about) but these simple, unassuming songs that came from the worshipping heart of Israel's King David and his fellow worshippers. In this Treasury, we see a prayer for every occasion. We see the entire spectrum of the spiritual man's experience - penitence, courage, humiliation, power, confidence, exultation, doubt, weeping, laughter, awe, dread, fear and ultimately worship. Rightly did Faber exclaimed, &quot;The Thought of Thee is almost prayer&quot;. This volume brings together the worship of David to Jehovah and Spurgeon to Jesus showing that they were both ultimately worshipping One same God. &quot;Hear O Israel, the Lord thy God is One Lord&quot;.<br />The volume I'm reviewing here is an update of the original 7 volume set written in Victorian English. What we have here is the result of Roy H. Clarke's 10 year research into the life and writtings of Spurgeon. For those of you who distrust any update of a classic, rest assured that the work done here is exemplary work. Clarke has too much respect for Spurgeon to ever water down his words - every word by Spurgeon is here (only archaic words are replaced with modern English usage of the same). Clarke did not water down Spurgeon's words with the language of commerce but allowed the spaciousness, reverence and expansiveness of Spurgeon's English to be retained - and to speak afresh to us today in language that we can understand. Clarke removed most of the quotations from the other commentators in Spurgeon's original volumes and included only the most significant in this volume side-by-side with Spurgeon's own notes (something only done in this volume for the first time). Finally, the original notes of preachers are now presented in outline form according to the outlines for Spurgeon's own sermons (something that Roy Clarke himself spent his 10 years studying). Reading this volume makes me want to seek out the original 7 volume set (still in print) but I would say that even for those who have already read the original, this volume is still very valuable - for its dynamism, its freshness and as an aid by which we can listen to a man who listens to God.	2000-12-23

Jeanette Winterson's semi-autobiographical novel is one of the most beautifully written story of a middle-class girl struggling to come to terms with her own sexuality, creativity, passion vs. her family/society's  inflexible &quot;formed opinions&quot;. The story of the persecution of a  girl because of her sexual preference (in this case, lesbianism) is not  new. It's how Ms. Winterson presents her story. Fresh. Alive. Witty. Funny.  Heartbreaking at times. Imaginative. Almost like you were holding a piece  of someone's soul in your hands rather than merely a book. I noticed that  one reviewer mentioned that the book's sexual nature is vulgar. I do not  find this so. Even if it is, so what? Life is vulgar. Only those fond of  sweeping the dirt under the carpet so that it stays out of sight (or those  who drive lesbian girls from their house/church and pretend they don't  exist) will disagree with the innate vulgarity of all life. This book is  the antidote for that kind of sanitized thinking.

The problem is that the average Christian bases his/her faith too much on tradition and fables (Christmas, Easter, etc.) rather than paying more attention to proper history.<br />The starting chapters on Leonardo  are fascinating. The commentaries on the coded messages in his paintings to  the mysterious Lady M and John the Baptist are very intriguing. Although I am still largely unconvinced on their theory of Leonardo's faking of the Turin Shroud. There are grounds to believe that John the Baptist cults and the Magdalene cults have been around for centuries.<br />However, upon a rereading of this book, I found it to be filled with lots of unproven assumptions and relying instead on the convenient stringing-together of popular conspiracy theories - Goddess Traditions in ancient Christian sects, Gnosticism, Templar, Cathar, etc. etc.	1998-10-06
