To me it just seems much too easy to wait for a company to fail and then analyze and formulate certainties about why it failed. Conversely it's much to easy to do the same for a company that succeeds. I have yet to see anybody make projections about companies that are executing certain branding tactics RIGHT NOW!!! If these laws are immutable then we should clearly be able to find more than a handful of companies that have mutated these laws and say \\"Yes they will fail.\\"<BR>My feeling is that these laws and bits of certainties apply only to the past. And since the past can't be modified neither can the laws that are applied to them. But what about laws for the future? And can branding and marketing laws for the future even exist? Probably not. Because, and I'm sure most marketing guru's will agree, the tastes and preferences of consumers are anything but immutable. They change all the time. Even our ability to recieve and process information quite frankly depends on our mood - and I make that statement as a consumer and not as a Advertising specialist.<br />I would not classify these ideas of this book as laws, but more as considerations. They are things to consider when making choices about a Brand Strategy. We can analyze to high heaven about why a Brand will pass or fail, but in the end it will depend on the fickle desires of the consumer. We do our best to forecast, but even the weatherman has screwed up a \\"Bright and Sunny\\" forecast on what resulted in a Rainy and Miserable day.<BR>Consumers are no different. And it is improbable if not impossible that we will ever lock down End-All-Be-All laws that will encapsulate the \\"Whatever\\" attitude of the public.	2002-10-22

My hope when buying this book was that I would find more indepth information about the creation of colors with insight coming from the people who assisted in its production. What I found was 1/3 of the book being redundant with Tibors book &quot;Perverse Optimist.&quot;  The last 1/3 of the book is a reproduction of issue 13 - an issue I already own - so that wasn't very helpful either.<br />I was almost completely dissapointed with this book until I reached the middle section - an archive of Tibor's sketches, doodles and thoughts that help readers like myself see exactly how he initiated ideas for Colors Magazine. THIS IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. This fairly extensive section of the book offers heaps of photos that document Tibor's professional and activist life from High School onward. The supporting text by Maira is heart warming, funny and enlightmening. This section alone justifies buying the book.	2002-06-29

I have always wondered what life is like for a person who is responsible for 1000's of jobs and millions of dollars. When we see CEO's on the news, they are a lot like politicians - providing neutral answers to probing questions. This book does what the media fails to do, which is getting this business mavens to talk about real issues concerning their business and society in general. The responses are less formal, more relaxed and appear to be honest. Suprisingly, this book make CEO's appear to be servants of a complex circle of Customers, Employees and Shareholders. Which, I suppose, in the grander scheme of things that is what they are. <br />The only dissapointment of this book is that 85% of it is the author filling in his own interpretation and editorial comments between actual quotes from the CEO's. It would have been nice if the book was a series of interviews. This would have given readers more objective content and allowed us to decipher the language for ourselves. With only 15% of the reading being actual pull quotes from several CEO's, I would have to say that we only get a small glimpse of the CEO's mind. <br />But all in all, the author does a great job of posing the right questions to the right people. He certainly has a moral agenda that most of the consumer population would side with. It was nice to know that someone is willing to hold up the mirror of social responsibilty to the business world.	2001-07-06

Sometimes they touch upon mature topics such as aids, racism etc. But every so often the &quot;Brat&quot; in them comes out and brings us a book such as this one.<br />Of course, the first reaction is that it is a disgusting book that isn't worth the paper it's printed on (suprisingly, know one thought of printing it on toilet paper). But if you actually take the time to read the stories about &quot;poo&quot; from around the world you begin to find some really interesting content. In fact, the stories are what saves the book from being a cheap visual prank on the viewers eyes.<br />I also like the fact that each photograph of &quot;poo&quot; is labelled with the animal it came from (including humans).<br />If you can stomach such a book, I think it's a subject worthy of reading and digesting.	2001-05-01

It was the title that caught my attention and sucked me into the sale. My initial reaction was &quot;Here we go...another business guy attempting to make his mark in self-mythology.&quot;<br />But then I opened the book, read a few pages and discovered that the book was not quite as pretentious as I thought it would be. In fact, the stories are both endearing and enlightening.  As he recollects his rags to riches history, he shows that (contrary to popular opinion) there is a human side to business.  He uses his own life, mistakes and victories to teach some fairly profound lessons about life in the office...and just life in general. He even dares to incriminate himself as he reveals much about the corporate attitude towards women in the workplace.<br />It's certainly worth reading.  And though I'm nowhere near the status of successful business man...it's nice to know how the other side is actually thinking.	2001-03-19
US	52457980	R3O7IM6HSGFHGG	0944210260	153474369	Everyday Heroes	Books	5	9	9	N	N	A great motivator	The real life stories in this book all deal with the adversities of everyday life, growing up, going to school, being a parent etc. It also shows how everyday people have jumped the high burdles in life that cripple many of us.  For that reason these people are heroes.  They are not celebrities or anyone you will read about in magazines or newspapers.  They are just &quot;normal people.&quot; But they've done extraordinary things.<br />An added bonus with this book is that it is real easy reading. The stories are at most 5 pages long per person.  The writing style is simple, to the point but never losing it's spirituality. The editorial doesn't even try to glamourize the people mentioned. It simply shows that life is hard - but the will of the human spirit is even harder.<br />This book is an excellent motivator! As corny as this may sound, it makes you say to yourself the words, &quot;I can.&quot;  It makes you realize that we all have the potential to be heroes to ourselves and to people around us.	2001-03-16

This book breaks the maxim, &quot;You can't judge a book by it's cover.&quot; With a honest title and a no frills cover, you open the book and you find postcards that live up to everything you didn't expect: No humor. No fancy photography. No witty postcard statements. No nothing.  These are simple photographs of the most boring subjects a person can chance upon: Interstate highways, hotel rooms and Cafetteria Food.  <br />But then you stop for a moment and wonder why something so boring could possibly hold your attention for so long. I think the mesmerizing element of these boring postcards is that they are actually doing what they were intendid to do during their creation: They are bookmarks of a persons travel. They show you where a person was as they crossed the state line into Ohio.  Sure the toll booth in the photograph is not much to look at...but you almost feel as if you are in the car with the traveller.  <br />Also, because these photos are from the 50's and 60's...you feel as if this is not only a travel across the country. But a travel back into time. A young fella like myself can actually appreciate the look of days that are before my time.  The best part is that they aren't tampered with.  No photography tricks or advertising acrobats.  These were point and click photos that aren't trying to be sexy. So yes, these postcards are definitly boring. But that's what is so exciting about them.	2001-02-19

I'm reviewing the paperback because I actually bought a 2nd copy of the book (one to keep untouched and the other to read several times).  And now that I've gone through the book for the umpteenth time, I want to add more thoughts to my last review...<br />I'm begining to realize that the true magic behind the work of Tibor is that it's very personal.  Tibor's work searches for some human quality inside us that it can appeal to.  It relates to us as imperfect, informal human beings.  Unlike most design today that is either self-indulgent or polished off and buttoned up, the work in this book seems to have a &quot;come as you are&quot; invitation to it.  This was Tibor's gift.  This was his major contribution to the work done in this book. As you surf through all 400+ pages you'll see that in the beginning his work was design &quot;having something to sell&quot;.  But suddenly his work detours and becomes design &quot;having something to say.&quot;<br />The best part about this book is that it brings us inside the minds of all the people Tibor worked with, worked for (clients) and worked against. The eye opener is that their was a lot of pain that went into the production of this work. You learn that Tibor's passion became a blessing and curse for those he colloborated with.  But you begin to learn that these &quot;mistakes, misunderstandings and mis-comprehensions&quot; are often an unexpected ingredient in producing fresh and interesting work.<br />I encourage this book to anyone who wants to see a new perspective on graphic design and the industry.  But more importantly, it's a motivation for us to re-evaluate our own perspective on the industry.	2001-02-13

The kind that really makes you think...&quot;Wow!!!&quot;  As it turns out, many of these illusions are tricks that I remember encountering when I was in grade school.  For example, staring at a black silouhette for several seconds burns a &quot;ghosted&quot; image in your eyes.  So if you then stare at a white wall directly after, you'll see the same image. Tricks such as that were great when I was younger.  And, true, it was nice to see these forgotten illusions resurface.  I suppose I was just looking for something a little more novel. Some of the other illusions include finding hidden pictures within a picture.  Or an image that becomes another image when flipped upside down (see the cover).  All of these were fun...but at the most I gave each &quot;gag&quot; only 15-30 seconds of my time. There was one redemptive illusion that merited this set a rating of 3 stars - the ones that require holding an image up to light.  That was very entertaining!!!	2001-02-06

First of all, the character illustrated in this book is not the God we (or least me) were taught about in Sunday school.  God, in this book, is a sporadic combination of peaceful parent and ruthless disciplinary.  He's inconsistent in his laws and confused about his relationship with man.  Some of the details that Jack points out about God in this book are endearing, shocking and in some cases appalling.<br />Is this book meant to slap God in the face?  Is it meant to turn the bible upside down - as well as the beliefs of all it's readers?<br />I don't think so.  Anybody with a knowledge of history must acknowledge that the bible we read today has passed through so many hands that the remnants are bastardized philosophies and attempts at Man to make God into &quot;His God.&quot;  Much of the language used by God, and his actions described in this book are obviously the result of artistic liberties taken by some pretty bold authors.  My feeling is that Jack is not trying to slam God...but slam his creators.<br />If nothing else, read this book for it's different perspective. Question it - but look for answers to your questions.  This book is not an end-all answer...it's just another miniscule step towards our desire to know about the main character in all of our lives.	2001-01-15

For instance you might be cleaning your closet and find something that inspires an idea.  Or you may be reading the newspaper and find a word that inspires a novel or a poem.  Those moments are what this book is all about.  It's complete with multiple suggestions of finding those moments.  Some of the excercises are simply looking at an everyday object and &quot;inverting&quot; its function.  Fipping things upside down....all of these types of activities are useful in removing the brain from a comfort zone or a stagnat position that results in writers block. The great thing about this deck is that it's not only for writers...it really works for anyone who is creative.  I could see this deck being useful to the inventor, the designer, the scientist, the novelist, the poet, the artist etc....<br />Take this Tool kit (a pocket book and flash cards) and actually use them!

He works with the some of the smartest people in New York - and the dumbest.  It's a demanding job that takes more then it gives back...even if it means taking away your entire life!<br />Most people in advertising run into the same road block as this main character (Is this work really important?  And if so...Why?) Our hero in this book illustrate a common cynicism that makes you think, laugh and cry.  Although the mood is dark, the ideas brought forth in this novel are very enlightening.<br />On the surface this book is about the perils of working in advertising.  But deep down this book is about the perils of working in ANY job that demands you put more in your professional life then you do in your personal job.  Although profoundly funny, this book is a reminder of what's really important in life.<br />Now if you'll excuse me, I have a job to quit.	2001-01-02

Heres a book with all kinds of techniques and suggested juxtapositions with this and that and why not try this effect...blah, blah and more blah. This book should have shipped inside a pancake mix box with the instructions: &quot;For instant creativity, just add water.&quot;  Once upon a time graphic design was about discovering an idea.  Today you can either find it in clip art, photoshop filters or...books like this one.  A book with &quot;over the counter&quot; ideas is a sad testimony that our craft is losing its craft.  That people are no longer in search of a new way, but simply recycling old ways. If we are going to pull techniques from a can then why call ourselves Graphic Designers?  Why not call ourselves Desktop Publishers?  In fact, why not hand this book to our client and tell them to hire their burger boy nephew who happens to have his own Mac or PC at home. The whole point of design is that we find NEW ideas and techniques that differentiate our clients (and ourselves) from others.  So someone please tell me where that differentiation occurs when everyone finds themselves reaching for books of this nature, scrambling for an off the shelf cake mix as opposed to inventing their own recipe. If I made an &quot;Idea Index book&quot; it would have 1000 pages in it. All of them blank! And the book would come with a free pencil.	2000-12-14

It's like being a child again and walking around the world and seeing 500 different people, with 500 different cultures and ways of expressing ideas.  It's like having the eyes of a 5 year old and asking the question over and over...&quot;What? and Why?&quot;  This book is playful discovery. Just imagine opening a book with no introduction, no words...only photos of people around the world - what they wear, what they're doing and how they do it.  But like a child you have no idea, no clues or anything.  These photos begin to speak for themselves.  You don't have the advantage (or disadvantage) of having a writer attach prejudices or judgements to these photos - you are left to explore your own words, prejudices and thoughts.  You not only learn things about people...but you learn a lot about yourself and your pre-conceptions about other folks.<br />For those of you who are Tibor fans...Maira has a very touching write up about her late husband and why he initiated this book.	2000-10-11

Ha, ha...no seriously.  This book is for people who love to observe and watch people.  It's for those of us who are curious and enchanted about the way people live and what they do from day to day...especially in a jumping and jamming place like 42nd Street.  In fact, all 1000 faces were part of an art project to help revitalize New York's infamous 42nd Street. Tibor had a method of not just looking at photos...but observing them. Studying them.  If you do this with these photos you begin to realize that these are not just faces - interesting lives actually exist behind these faces.  And as you turn each page and see black faces, white faces, fat faces, skinny faces, funny faces and serious faces (The &quot;chillin'&quot; Guy) then you begin to appreciate how diverse and wonderfully populated our lives are with unique people - especially if you take the time to meet them. Well..I guess I'm going on a tangent.  If you love people and the ideas of Tibor...then this is a book for you.	2000-10-03

Creativity is a boundless entity  that resists any kind of logical or mathematical scrutiny.  However, this  book seems to try exceedingly hard to pull apart such a magical force in  design and break it down into its simple components.  I'm not saying that  this attempt is &quot;BAD&quot;...I'm just saying its futile.  After  closing the book I didn't feel as if I gained any more enlightenment about  creativity then before.  What I did gain was the great joy of seeing so  many incredible examples of how designers have taken seemingly impossible  design problems and turning them into clever solutions THAT WORK!  But  Again, in spite of all the analytical chapters that preceed the example  pages, you still look at many of the sample works shown and ask the  inevitable question of &quot;How did they think of that?&quot; I don't  believe there is a way to study, analyze or answer that question.  The best  thing to do is enjoy the work and stay inspired.  BTW, at the end they have  interviews with some of the greats such as Paul Rand and Micheal Beirut.  I  think many of the readers will enjoy their insight.	2000-06-12

This doll is an excellent 3 Dimensional representation of Max  Stravinsky...with his 2 tone ears, mushy nose, akward eyes and clothes that  look like they were purchased at a thrift store (maybe they were).

But after exploring these pages I developed a fondness for her creative thinking.  Oppenheim had a certain flare for novelty that many creative people seem to  lack. You'll see exactly what I mean when you check out the various photos  of some of her wild ideas (like a belt made out of arms - so it looks like  someone has their arms around you).  It was great to see so many artistic  possibilities that I never would have considered. The book is very well  written and gave enough information for me to feel as if I've learned  something valuable about this artist.

They did a great job of detailing the process of composing effective ads.  They also developed some really good examples of advertising that gets results.  I guess what  bothers me is how shameless the writers are.  First of all, this book might  as well be a brochure for their agency...since all they do is brag about  how creative their ideas are.  Second of all, it seems as if they are  guiltless about the seductive powers of advertising. But like I said...this  book swings both ways.  People who are cynical about the business will hate  this book.  People who are shameless will treasure it.  And then there's  people like me who can't figure out which end is up.

How do we improve the level of spiritual experiences that connect between a companys products  or architecture and the human beings who use them.  One example that Stumpf  brings up is the experiences we have on airplanes.  Plane travel is usually  a very tiring experience for most travellers.  But why does it have to be  that way?  A plane brings us so much closer to the sky that it might be  enjoyable if telescopes were hooked up so that people can do some star  gazing etc. My first reaction was &quot;Yeah Right&quot; to many of the  examples that Stumpf illustrated.  But on second thought I began to realize  that Stumpfs thinking is exactly what we need in todays commercial  industry.  Products and services these days are created only for profit but  advertised as if they will improve our quality of life. And maybe they do.   But Stumpf is talking about a more spiritual &quot;Quality of Life.&quot;   The kind that gives a person memories.  The kind that makes a person  connect as a human being with all the creations we impose upon society.   What I admire most about the book is that it dares to be optimistic.  I  can't say that all of the ideas mentioned in here are practical...but so  what?  The idea, I believe, is to get designers and architects to put more  heart into their creations.  To consider the spiritual functions of what we  do...and not just the marketing functions.  This book, I say, is a good  read.  Take your time reading it. Read it during a quiet rainy day while  drinking some coffee.  Enjoy the experience (hint. hint)	2000-05-31

While the authors tried to give this story a begining, a middle and an  end...in essence, this book is very much like going to visit your  grandfather and having him recollect all of the things that happened in his  past.  It is not the plot that makes this book compelling...it is the  collection of experiences.  The journey that Mr. Dawson took in his early  years that opens a memory bank of what life was like during a time when I  wasn't even born. Mr. Dawsons added wit and ability to tell a story, helps  bring these pages to life.  In the end you not only have a great  appreciation for the past, but you also develop a deep affection for what  life is like today (inspite of all the bad things).  It is a true  encouragement for a person to maintain their optimism.	2000-05-30

That is not to imply that this book isn't any good.  It's actually very thought  provoking for people who actually think!   The book is loaded with photos  and illustrations juxtaposed with BRIEF TEXT.  The goal of the book is to  offer a surreal opinion about the moral and emotional motivations in our  society.  It's also poking a very accusing finger at the advertising world.   <br />If you're the kind of person who can solve this equation  5 + X =10,  then chances are you have the mental abilities to fill in the blanks and  produce the message that Byrne is trying to communicate.  But if you're the  kind of person who needs the message spelled out to you, then chances are  you won't enjoy this book.  Simply stated, this book is like looking at a  piece of art...&quot;some imagination required.&quot;	2000-05-23

It's a simple technique - yet it works. If you take 15 minutes to just look at a photo, eventually the photo will begin to speak to you. This lesson is even more profound when you allow the photos of \\"The Family of Man\\" to speak to you. Each photo encapsulates a tiny portion of the human experience and serves as a vivid mirror of our own spirit. As we journey from birth to death we see all the flaws and fascinating qualities that make the human being a beautiful work in progress. And while the book is only 5% words I've yet to complete it. Why? Because I've found myself watching closely each photo for the amount of time it takes to finish the chapter of a book. And each \\"chapter\\" that I've seen tells me several things: That we are all bonded by love, struggle, survival, passion, pain, fears, dreams, belief and hope.	2000-01-03

It almost brings tears to my eyes just thinking about what I experienced in the pages of this book.  This educational treasure cuts through the  clutter of daily news and brings you  to the personal and political front lines of two girls seperated by war.   Somewhere in each letter is the innocence of youth, however at all times  there is a learned vehemance budding in every letter. Despite the political  barriers between both girls, there is the common denominator of friendship.  When they look at each other as Arab and Jewish...they tend to think  &quot;She's one of the enemy.&quot;  However, when they look at each other  as Mervet and Galit they tend to think &quot;She is my friend.&quot;  To me  this book is proof that people can learn to celebrate divirsity if they  would only stop to listen and talk to each other.	1999-10-01

I had long since lost the books and had forgotten that they even existed. And then one day I saw &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; on sale for 25 cents at a  Garage Sale.  Right away my mind jumped back to my youth.  Needless, to say  I bought the book as well as the complete set. Now that I am an adult I am  amazed at how inspiring the books are.  There is so much behind the words  written in these books and I am grateful that I  took the time to re-read  them 15 years later! I think the idea of Taran searching for his history is  reflective of many things in the lives of all people - young and old!   There is a magic to these pages that I hope will not become a rarity in  books written by todays authors.  Alexander doesn't write books, he creates  visions.  I'm just glad that he decided to share his visions with many  others.	1999-09-15

It allows us to hear the information from the horses mouth, as opposed to a journalist paraphrasing him or her. My favorite interviews were with Bernbach and  Rosser Reeves.  However, I don't think this book is really about the  &quot;Art&quot; of writing advertising.  I think the book should have been  called &quot;Conversations about Advertising.&quot; Because the book isn't  made to be a teacher, it's simply a good book to read and enjoy if you're  interested in hearing another perspective about the business.	1999-07-29

They remind me that things can be flipped sideways or turned upside down. I wish I could borrow Maira's eyes and mind  and heart so that I can see the world the way she does.	1999-07-09

Of all the books this one travels with me everywhere I go just in case I need a little inspiration.  Tibor and his pack of designers I believe have defined what design and  communication is all about.  They have pushed ideas to the point of rare  novelty.  With many of the designs in this book I can see that M&amp;Co  never stops asking the greatest of all creative questions: &quot;What  if?&quot; There is only one thing I hate about the book - It makes me  second guess everything that I do. Is it orginal? Is it &quot;What if&quot;  enough? Am I following the creative line that is widely walked or have I  grown enough spine to stray off the beaten path?<br />...Or am I just full of  s**t?	1999-05-28

This book is great for seeing what some of the most recognized  professionals are doing in this industry.   Reading their insights about  what makes a good Art Director was quite encouraging for a Junior such as  myself.  You also, get a glimpse of what some of the personalities are like  which is important in the work world.  The work presented in this book are  quite amazing.  My only concern is that most of the work seen was for big  name clients that encourage creativity.  I've always been more impressed  when an agency can take a client that nobody has ever heard of and turn it  into something that people will want to hear from (which as we know is the  challenge of design and advertising).  Perhaps someday we will find books  that expose not-so-famous clients and how not-so-famous Creative people  managed to produce great work for them.	1998-10-26

If you read  between the lines of this story you will see that Pandora is an anti-heroic  symbol of hope for the human race.  And that hope emerges from the fact  that human beings  are beautiful people.  The things we do are beautiful.   The things we create are motivated by our need for beauty.  And all of this  springs from the love of the human heart.  And Pandora FEEDS upon this!	1998-10-02
