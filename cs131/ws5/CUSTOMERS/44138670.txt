It is the second book I read for Jose Saramago after \\"Blindness\\", and I am still amazed with his writing style, and his ability to captivate the reader from beginning to end. He keeps the reader so close to the story, the details get you very involved, the turn of events keep you interested, and the concealed message is even much greater than all this excitement.<br /><br />Saramago's \\"All the names\\", the search of a complete story just by following a name could be full of surprises, headaches, and twists that could lead to too many unforeseen surprises, but more importantly gives you another meaning to life, and how each name is related to a life cycle!	2005-08-28

How people get hooked on few things in their heads, and many of their actions just depend on who is around them to notice them, and what image they would be transmitting.<br />Very interesting stories that keep you wondering, and the style of Kundera shocks you many times just by being very detailed oriented and open in his expressions and thoughts.	2002-06-10

Julian Barnes uses every chapter to touch very interesting beliefs and stories.

If you are looking for a fun book, easy reading, and even not to feel obligated to read all the sections, well this is one. Brooks describes very sharlpy the changes that have and still are facing the different crowds of the society in the United States.<br />It shows you the fakeness in their behavior, how so much is done just because it is the cool thing to do, not what they really like doing. How the country have changed in the last years, and how the values have just disappeared even at the daily level.<br />Some examples are really funny, they are so true though they make you wonder even more about the foundations people are trying to accomplish.<br />I guess less knowledge, and more superficiliaty made it work up to now.

How Israel was able to find herself a home out of no where, claim it and get all the support to stay.<br />The book tells how things even got worse by the arabs who kept on waiting to get involved, how all the dreams were only on paper, and how only talking about solutions and victory has to be followed by actions.<br />It also demonstrates how the Palestinains themselves did not have a great vision from the beginning, and how with time they have lost everything they believed they will get back. Now they find themselves in a worse situation than they were almost 40 years ago, when they only wanted to fight back against an enemy who is much more prepared, and recognized in the world.<br />One more aspect the book shows is how emotional people can be, not wanting to hear what is the truth, and how that can lead to a very sad and unjustified crime.<br />Beautifully written, not another history book, Shahadeh takes you through his daily struggle in the area, with his father, society, and himself to give you the best and cleares picture.	2002-03-04

She did change Kuhn life, he saw hope and connection in her, she inspired him, and and he found a better reason to compose music so he can hear her sinning.

Offers many questions to be thought of in order to find a new approach to this adventure, opens our eyes on daily issues, that we have the tendency to take for granted, because this is the way they have been taught to us, and we feel no need to get any deeper into them.<br />A story about the Holocaust, and the connection between the Jews, German and Russians, how people reacted differently to that, and what risks were involved to the ones around. It includes some nice songs, and poems that Doctorow felt needed in order to lighten up a little his book, and to transmit his ideas. It talks about the relationships between people, the origin of God and life.<br />The book will add more dilemmas in your head, and if you are not into some serious reading and un-answered questions, then you are reading the wrong book.	2001-06-29

This has been the first book I read for Amy Tam, and I must add her style of writing did positively surprise me, which would encourage me to read more for her...<br />After a slow start, the book starts getting much more interesting, it enters more into the chinese culture, the beliefs the older generation had, and the hard life they had to go through, it does tell us how much different we can be, and how we have the tendency to blame others for our mis-fortunes!!!<br />It has been a book that I wanted to finish in one sitting...It has been written with lots of emotions, it is a sad book, the kind that shows life in it's unfair picture....but contains a lot to learn from, and pages to read again and again...<br />I like the way the book went into detail regarding LuLing's story, and everything she went through and discovered, just an incredible story...for sure a book to read	2001-05-02
