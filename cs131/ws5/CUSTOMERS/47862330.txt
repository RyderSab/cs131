Author, Linda Kranz, has found yet another way to share her love of journaling for young people by asking young writers to share their love for nature.  All children are drawn to the wonderful world of nature around them and whether they are a city child or a country child, this journal will inspire them to begin writing down their experiences.  From a more personal note, I raised two sons who would never be caught writing in a journal as children, but if \\"My Nature Book\\" had been available when they were growing up, they would have jumped all over this.  It is fun, encouraging and allows the young writer to relive over and over the mini adventures they experienced and shared with natures world.  Suggest \\"My Nature Book\\" in holiday stockings, for birthdays or just because every child can never, ever have too many books that are fun!	2004-09-23

I love books for children, especially those that can inspire writing, creativity and interactive dialogue.  Every young person should have a journal or diary at least once in their life, but this shameless journal ripoff based on Nick Jr. commercialism is nothing but a slick sticker activity book.  Extremely juvenile in its approach it does not inspire young people to write about themselves and their world but merely respond to a network television's idols.  If you really want to give your young ones an opportunity to enter the delightful world of journaling, seek out the young person's classic by Linda Kranz, \\"All About Me: A Keepsake Journal for Kids\\" published by Northland Publishing.  This favorite among young people, by Ms. Kranz, now boasts a second \\"More About Me, Another Keepsake Journal for Kids\\" which lets your young writer explore their world and themselves even further.	2004-06-18

This is an excellent overview of the heart of California wine country, Napa Valley &amp; Sonoma.  Loaded with lush photography and insight into the tradition of winemaking, the author takes another leap and provides you with fine dining and lodging selections in the areas as well.

This allows you to date and check off when you sampled that particular bottle as well as motivate the pursuit to sample all that these wineries have to offer. If you are planning a vacation to Napa or Sonoma, this is a must have.	2004-03-03

I was hoping for something great from Beadwork (the magazine) and this was not it.  Lots of pictures and examples all with instructions should have made up for my disappointment, however, it didn't.  The examples of beadwork necklaces are mediorce at best and can be found in nearly every book available on the market today.  Beadwork Magazine has had amazing bead artists in their mag and I was hoping those were to be the pieces with instructions offered.  The size and cut of the book is not usable either.  I understand that publishers like to experiement with different sizes and shapes to capture buyers attention, but as a practical use, it has none. The pages do not lay flat in spite of this being touted in their advertisment.  The long, skinny length of this does not allow for ease in following directions either.  I have watched the bead industry soar these past 5-7 years and this book does not reflect this creative direction.  Perhaps I am a bit jaded as I have been beading for so long and have seen what is out there, still, an offering from Beadwork Magazine should have had more splash and usable pizazz.  This may be a strong springboard into beading for the beginning beader.	2003-12-11

I had read previous reviews about this series and since I enjoyed the Vampire books that Ann Rice had written, I was looking forward to her new twist on an old fairytale.  It was awful.

Definitive resource for those who love SW design	Author, Linda Mason Hunter and photographer, Peter Vitale, have truly created a beautiful book showcasing the architecture and design of the American southwest.  Spectacular photography and rich in text make this a visual feast for the eyes and mind.<br />Hunter divides this book into two parts: Elements and Regions.  Part One contains chapters on Territory, Architecture, Architectural Details, Soul (my favorite chapter) and Rooms. Part Two covers West Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and the Four Corners region.  From large, minimalist rooms with an alter or wall dedicated to the minutia of masks or milagros to rooms packed with painted furniture, baskets, deer horns, glassware and old family portraits indicative of the American West, Southwest Style demonstrates this often casually eclectic decorating form.<br />This unique marriage of cultures and landscapes has become a personal and spiritual decor favorite worldwide.  Ms. Hunter states it best in the opening paragraph of Chapter Four, SOUL,  &quot;Southwest style includes a range of design concepts which, when found in combination, conveys a unique spirit of place.&quot;  It is that \\"unique spirit of place\\" that this beautiful book offers to the reader.	2000-10-17

All About Me, A Keepsake Journal for Kids is a gem.  Author, Linda Kranz, has a special insight into what children are thinking and feeling and she invites them to write it down in this child's first journal.  Ms. Kranz  uses &quot;thought-starters&quot; such as &quot;Name something you have  done that makes you proud&quot; and &quot;If someone gave you a million  dollars, what would you do with it?&quot;  &quot;How does your answer  change when you think about it a little longer?&quot;   This is the perfect  journal for both girls and boys and an inviting way to encourage them to  begin writing down their thoughts and feelings with their own words.	2000-05-12

Every father or father-to-be should take the time to enter &quot;his&quot; story in this journal written just for fathers by Linda Kranz.  As in her four  previous journals, Linda provides &quot;thought-starters&quot; that lead  the writer through the journaling process. This journal is divided into two  sections, the first and larger, encourages fathers to share memories about  their lives such as their first job, learning to drive, family/holiday  traditions, and other facets of their growing up.  The second focuses on  the father's experiences with his children and their time together. A copy  of &quot;A Father's Journal&quot; should be put in the hands of every new  father and all fathers of growing and grown children.    This is a true  record of a father's family history and should be shared and passed down  through the family over and over again.	2000-05-12

Santa Fe decorating style is an inviting decor which overlaps several regions with warmth and a comfort feeling.  Although this book, SANTA FE STYLE, has an inviting cover and beautiful color photographs, it is filled  with black and white photos of interiors as well...too many for the cost of  this book.  Overall has a &quot;dated&quot; look to it, oversized fonts and  poor use of white space, and photos are often lost in the center  bindings...all a major distraction to this book.  Consider Mexican Country  Style by Witnyski &amp; Carr.	2000-05-05

Beading how-to books, in the past, have been difficult to locate and recent interest in beadwork and the various techniques have inspired many newcomers to this creative field.  Although this booklet has an inviting  cover it is poorly constructed in layout, copy and design.  Schematics are  poorly drawn pen/ink drawings with hand lettering which make reading the  copy difficult. I would not recommend this to a beginner as it will  frustrate the new beader and the booklet is too rudimentary in format for  an intermediate or skilled beader.  There are numerous beginner or guide to  beading books available now.  Skip this one altogether.	2000-05-05

A gently written and beautifully illustrated book on what makes us all different and uniquely ourselves. Pre-schoolers as well as elementary age children will want to read this one over and over again.  (I raised my two  sons with this book and it continued to be one of their favorites).  Dora  Leder's pencil illustrations are almost &quot;photo&quot; perfect and  capture the snapshots of activities and differences that author, Norma  Simon so quietly describes.   &quot;Why Am I Different&quot; (no matter how  many times I read it with my children) always invoked dialogue and  opportunities for discussions on understanding the many differences that  make people so unique.  This is a gem of a book and I am delighted to see  it is still so ready available.	2000-03-25
