In  Rollins' latest adventure, we're tagging along with a new cast of characters on the hunt to find a long lost city under the Arabian desert.  The main cast consists of Lady Kara Kensington, head of the family empire who funded and founded the gallery where curator Safia Al-Maaz (longtime childhood friend to Kara or is there more to this relationship than first meets the eye of the reader???) covets many long lost antiquities; Omaha Dunn, ex-fianc to Safia (plenty of tension there!) and covert government agent Painter Crowe (adding more sexual tension to the Safia-Omaha mix).  After a mysterious explosion destroys a portion of the museum (caused by a strange lightning ball  as it strikes an artifact known as the Iron Camel), an odd artifact is found within a sandstone statue that sends our cast of characters on the chase to find the long lost city of Ubar as they try to elude the \\"enemy\\" trying to get to the lost city first.    Who gets there first?  Who is the enemy?  Who lives/dies?  Who saves the day?  Who ends up with the lovely Safia? Buy the book and find out!  I thoroughly enjoyed the story.  I loved the fact that many of the main characters were female (as was the token \\"bad guy\\") in Rollins' latest masterpiece.  Very imaginative storyline and the ending...well...I can't tell you how it ends but it's well worth the time invested!  I read this book with absolute fascination, often trying to figure out what was fiction and what was not.   Learned something about buckyballs...one of the things I thought was fiction! And cool trick with the sand shoes by the way...  I'd love to see Hollywood's CGI experts trying to do justice to the very picturesque and unique scenes found in the last quarter of this book!	2004-06-29

I'm not going to bother giving you a synopsis of the storyline for this novel, the publisher's blurb preceding these reviews does a fine job of that.  Personally, I think this book is probably the most action packed of Rollins' collection of novels.  I was hooked by page 25, talking to myself as I cheered on the good guy as he escaped from snipers by page 59, was forgetting to make myself some supper by page 150, living on popcorn and Coke Classic by page 300 with nothing on my mind  but reaching the end of this fun ride!  This book is packed with nail biting chases and battles, a white knuckle plane ride in the first 100 pages that will leave you breathless and hoping you see it on the big screen one day and more than enough interesting twists and turns to make you drool with anticipation and suspense.  I won't give anything away in regards to the base storyline or what you'll find lurking deep in that ice station but believe me, it will be worth the time you invest to read this book.  All the excitement comes together into a climactic ending that will make your jaw drop. Rollins incorporated a nice mix of different characters, some more intense than others but all relevant to the storyline and for moving it forward. An absolutely brilliant story with a very imaginative ending. I absolutely LOVED this book!!! This was how action/adventure was meant to be written!	2003-07-01

The last in this series has enough twists and turns to absolutely make you hold your breath in anticipation.  You don't know who is going to betray whom, or which of your favorite characters are going to survive this white knuckle adventure.  It's filled with new evils, some of which can only be found in your worst nightmares...(spiders, lots and lots of spiders! Ugh!) This last installment in this series is a fitting conclusion to a wonderful ride into a world of fantasy and magick. I am still in awe that such a splendidly complicated tale can bloom from anyone's mind.  Bravo Monsieur Clemens, job well done.	2002-12-15

As mentionned in some of the other reviews, it's hard to accept that a team of Navy Seals could be so completely innept...their weapons get stolen, their Zodiac gets destroyed, their boat floats away...etc.  If I was that innept at my job, I would be OUT of a job! I did however enjoy the band of misfit characters, especially the crusty Savage.  One thing I didn't enjoy was the author's tendency to use extreme violence for no other reason other than to shock the reader.  The gratuitous abuse to animals in a few scenes did nothing to carry the story forward and was only there to make me flinch in disgust.  A little long in the tooth on the technical side in some parts as mentionned by other reviewers but other than that, once you get into the action sequences, you're hooked.	2002-08-18

Having a personal tendency to rank books by my favorite authors, this one ranks head to head with Rollins' first thrill ride SUBTERRANEAN. The concept and plot of this novel are both captivating and unusual thus making a suspenseful and exciting story to read.  Add to that the gigantic man eating crocs, land lubber piranhas and giant black panthers (my own personal faves), you're set for a rollercoaster ride.   You'll find that<BR>the action doesn't slow down and the characters drive the plot to its triumphant conclusion. The worse thing about reading this book was the feeling of &quot;what am I going to read now to top that?&quot; after I finished it!  The prologue alone was enough to hook me. Highly recommended. Rollins easily leaves his peers in the action/adventure genre behind him in the dust with this new novel.	2002-03-19

Without giving anything away, this book likely  has something for everyone who enjoys the action/adventure genre.  Natural disasters, world chaos, a missing Air Force One and the president, ancient civilizations, romance, name it and you'll find it in this novel - even including a Canadian!  This third novel by Rollins has more refined character development than his previous novels while at the same time, keeping the mystery and the adventure on an even keel.  If you enjoyed his previous novels, you won't be disappointed with this one.  In my opinion, Rollins easily ranks up there with the likes of Preston and Childs, DuBrul and other action/adventure writers.  In fact, so far, he's demonstrating consistancy in his writing unlike some of the other writers who seem to lose momentum after their first success and is in fact in the process of surpassing some of the other household name action/adventure authors.  Anxiously awaiting the next novel!  Monsieur Rollins, you make reading a pleasure as always...  ;-)	2001-06-30

It made me laugh out loud  on several occasions.  The story is about Craig, a screenwriter wannabe and  his band of misfit sidekicks, TV Star Dandy, PR guy Miles and enough  supporting cast members to keep you busy for at least a few hours of good  reading.  Did I forget to mention that Craig has just come out of the  closet after a failed relationship with a woman? And he tries  unsuccessfully to find the &quot;perfect&quot; relationship...over and over  and over again. Hilarious story.  Pick it up, you won't regret it.	2000-09-06

I actually thought this third installment was much better  developped than both &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; and &quot;Ender's  Game&quot;, and I have to agree with some of the other reviewers,  &quot;Ender's Game&quot; was much more simplistic in style and content.   The remainder of the series deals with deeper issues, philosophical and  ethical issues, society as a group issues, family values and the like. I'm  very much looking forward to see how the series ends.	2000-09-05

By far one of the better books I've read in a long time.  The story is  disturbing to say the least.  It's about control and domination by a man,  sexually and mentally, written from a woman's point of view.  Nora's sister  is brutally murdered with no apparent cause of death.  She's convinced the  ex boyfriend is the killer and decides to get involved with him and  whatever that entails to get to the bottom of her sister's death.  As  mentioned in my heading, this book is not for the weak of mind.  The sex is  graphic, and not run of the mill &quot;Harlequin Romance&quot; sex either.  It will shock some, intrigue others, fascinate many.  Well worth the time  invested.	2000-09-05

The  characters work well together...espcially for what they are hired to do in  this story.  This would actually play well as a television mini series.  It  has a lot of bits and pieces of the unexplained, an intriguing religious  twist as well as enough side stories on the side characters to keep you  interested.  Highly recommended.	2000-08-30

This series is proving to be very interesting indeed.  The first novel  plants an idea in your mind.  The second novel feeds that idea and suddenly  flips you over 360 degrees, although by that time, you're already thinking  along those lines based on the direction the storyline is going.  Again,  excellent writing style, intricate plot, good premise for a series, and no  idea where the story is heading.  This series could easily compete with the  now ever popular &quot;Left Behind&quot; series that in my opinion has  become too familiar and too predictable. The Searchers series has what the  &quot;Left Behind&quot; series is lacking, surprises at every corner,  suspense, and leaves you wanting more.  Bring on the third one!	2000-08-28

Once again, I would not put this novel in the sci-fi genre.  It's an  interesting study in human behavior intermixed with religious beliefs.  The  sci-fi aspect seems almost like an afterthought. I found this second one  much too slow, with too much religion  embedded into the story in fact.   But my interest is still piqued  enough to read the remainder of the  series.	2000-08-21

This  series has everything you need to take you on a magical fantasy ride.  I  can't possibly say anything that has not already been said about this  trilogy.  You'll find suspense, surprises, magic, hobbitts, elves, dwarves,  magical forests, good and evil...it covers the full scale of a satisfying  read.

This book came highly recommended by several friends so after searching  high and low for all four in the series, I dove into the first one head  first.  I was not disappointed.  And the ending was completely unexpected.   What's interesting with this novel, it would appeal to a non sci-fi fan as  much as to a die hard sci-fi fan.  The basis of the story is a study in  human psychology more than anything else. Am looking forward to the  remainder of the series.	2000-08-21

Having been written for children, that very much  comes across in the writing style.

Although I recognize the humor in this book, I was more amused by it than  finding it &quot;laugh out loud&quot; funny.  The misconception that ensues  with the CIA is just not believable to me.

Although I wish his editor had caught many of the typos and missing  or misplaced words! Those were numerous enough to be  distracting. Clarkson's sense for reality is exquisite.  Even though the  violence may not appeal to most people, I suspect sadly, it's closer to  real life than not. If you are looking for a fast paced police thriller  with lots of action and Steven Segalism...this is the book for you!  Rogue  cop about to lose his pension if he's booted off the force a year before  his retirement.  His commanding officer assigns him and a cast of equally  volatile cops to end the gang wars over an appartment complex.  A war  ensues between the crack dealers who use the appartment complex as a base  and the muslim gang hired by the complex owner to get them out.

A book is well written when you're not &quot;aware&quot; that you're reading the research that was obviously done.  Even though the story  was good on its own merit, I felt like I was in school listening to a  professor for much of it. A small amount of that is tolerable but not to  the extent found in this book. After a while, it becomes &quot;blah blah  blah blah&quot; to my mind. And once again, the author felt compelled to  add some romance to this action/adventure...as do most of the authors in  this genre seem to like to do.  At least, he gave the two main characters a  past history which made it somewhat more believable than throwing the two  together on a whim.  The other thing that nagged at my mind....this whole  story seems to happen in a very very short timeframe.  I find it hard to  believe that all that meticulous work could be done in that type of  extravagant/complicated multi-level archeological dig...	2000-07-28

The unfortunate thing about reading a series is I personally feel you have to read them whether they're bad or not.  Otherwise you feel out of the loop on the next one that comes out.  This has been a long time favorite  series of mine, but for some reason that eludes me still, this installment  didn't quite satisfy me.  The writing style is excellent as always, tight,  gritty, with Tanenbaum's usual edge but the plot and subplots in this one  were so tightly intertwined that it was sometimes too hard to follow. It  took longer than usual to get into the story itself, it took some effort to  keep me interested and I was also glad to finally wrap it up.

The rich guy wants the rock, the egotistical engineer determined to move the thing with no regards for human life or of possible failure in his mission... The  usual supporting cast with the sexual tension between characters sprinkled  around for who's benefit?  Not sure exactly...

I had it on good authority  ;-) that  I would probably enjoy this series and I admit I am pleasantly hooked.   This third installment is by far the best in the series thus far in my  opinion, where Clemens demonstrates the full potential of his writing skill  and his very vivid imagination.  Being an avid reader, I can truly say  authors of this calibre are few and far between, someone who can paint  detail into his story to the point where you can imagine yourself there,  where you're angry right along with the characters, where your stomach  lurches in a few scenes  (think squidlike skull beasties), where you feel  the emotion between Sy-wen and her bonded Ragnar'k/Kast (my personal  favorite character), where you hate Kral to the point of a private cheering  when he gets exposed for being a shape shifter....  A wonderfully intricate  plot where you find yourself completely immersed in this epic tale of  classic good versus evil. You simply don't want it to end...	2000-07-18

Toss  in some aliens who steal some Egyptian pyramids and chaos and madness  ensues.  How can one not be entertained?

Personally, if my life was on the line  and I was trying to survive, how good my cohort's hair smells would  probably be the last thing on my mind...	2000-06-13
US	49480523	RKDH8FNA6TVP9	0671024728	979997746	The Second Angel	Books	1	4	4	N	N	Tedious Read	Having been a fan of Kerr's previous novels, I was left disappointed with this one.  I didn't care about any of the characters, in fact, I couldn't remember who was whom when I'd leave the book overnight and picked it up  again the next day! The lack of emotion of the main character after losing  his wife and child were just plain not believable.  No grief, nothing, just  plain indifference. I found the author's research explaining just about  every new technical or futuristic twist too tedious to read...too much blah  blah blah after a while.  If you're interested in this type of sci-fi, try  out James Halperin's &quot;The First Immortal&quot;, you'll get far more  punch for your money.	2000-05-26

I found it tedious to read with so little satisfaction as an end result. The ending was the predictable cliff hanger that was hinted at throughout the book.    In fact, I found myself speed reading through some of what we've seen  plenty of in past installments of this series...being chased, being caught,  being chased some more...evading the pursuants..etc...  I hope the rest of  the series picks up speed since I am fast losing interest!	2000-05-23
