It shows that Welsh writing in English has existed for five centuries, not only though celebrated poets such as Herbert, Vaughan and Dyer but many others too.  The English language is not the only thread linking the first poet presented, Ieuan ap Hywel Swrdwal, with Mike Jenkins, the youngest poet included.  The poetry of praise, of community and attachment and celebration of place and of Welsh identity independent of England and influenced by Welsh language traditions is present throughout. So too is an attentiveness to form, structure and technique, all common to the Welsh language.	2003-03-14

Over the past fifteen years, this field of inquiry has grown rapidly, incorporating scholarly methods and theories from disciplines such as art history, anthropolgy, folklore, social history and cultural geography.  The twenty essays collected in Perspectives in Vernacular Architecture II represent the best and most recent scholarly work in the field.  They deal with such significant issues as the forms of common buildings and how they are altered; diagnostic characteristics of building types, geographic and social contexts of buildings; influences of ethnicity, technology and fabric on structures; and methods for understanding and recording vernacular architecture.  Articles that appear in this volume are selections based on quality and originality of their contributions from among papers presented during recent annual meetings of the Vernacular Architecture Forum.  All other papers are abstracted in a special appendix.  The Vernacular Architecture Forum itself was formed in 1980 to encourage the study and preservation of all aspects of common buildings and their context.	2003-01-07

In the second half of the eighteenth century, Oman broke free from foreign political control and became the dominant economic and naval force in the western Indian Ocean and the Gulf.  This was a golden Age for Omanis, when their economic power and political prestige were at their height. This study presents a detailed comprehensive history of this important period, and includes tribal politics, the role of religion and Oman's relations with neighboring areas such as Peris and East Africa. The era ends with the political and maritime pressures exerted on Oman by Britain and France and the territoral pressures exerted by the Wahhabi Arabians.

It is a travel book of sorts. It is a book about people who like their fun spiced with just a little danger.  Moving between the looking-glass worlds of East and West Berlin and out into the countires fo old Warsaw Pact, this is a snapshot of the dying days of Stalinism.  Here are riots in Romania and halluciantions in Prague, fun and games with border guards and black marketeers.  Hooligans, dissidents, soldiers and secret olicemen, exiles and people who would be exiles if only they could somehow get over the border.  This is about pushing your luck in police states, about getting stoned and going shippingin cummunist capitals, about trying to find a few beers in teh middle f a revolution.  Along the way it is about food, drugs, music and nature of consumerism and the nature of freedom.	2002-09-15

Do this and you will understand the thought processes of a good small-boat skipper, sail orpower.
