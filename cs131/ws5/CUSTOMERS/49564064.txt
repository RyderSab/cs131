I was actually crying when the grandmother asked that the children wait to use the rune until \\"the time is ripe\\".  Like in \\"Casablanca\\", the problems of a family being destroyed by the bad things in life don't amount to a hill of beans compared to nuclear war...<br />I can't imagine an intelligent child who likes time travel stories not falling in love with this book, which will always have a cherished place in my heart.	2004-05-12

R. R. Tolkien's retellings of stories from his \\"Silmarillion\\" mythology in various literary forms.  \\"The Lay of the Children of Hurin\\" tells the story of the early life of Turin in alliterative verse.  \\"The Lay of Leithian\\" tells the story of Beren and Luthien and their quest for a Silmaril in octosyllabic couplets.    \\"The Lay of Leithian\\" is considered by many Tolkien fans, including myself, to be one of the greatest pieces of literature composed by Tolkien, ranking alongside \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" itself.  Although unfinished, it is the most complete and elaborate version he ever wrote of the story of Beren and Luthien, which was probably closer to his heart than any other legend of his Middle-earth.  Reading this poem lets one see that, in a very real sense, Beren and Luthien are the heart of Tolkien's entire legendarium.    \\"The Lay of the Children of Hurin\\" also holds an important place in Tolkien's total corpus of writings as the only source for fully detailed versions of important episodes in the story of Turin:  his accidental slaying of his best friend, his healing by the Lake of Ivrin, and his coming to Nargothrond and first meeting with Finduilas.  This poem should be read in tandem with \\"The Children of Hurin\\" (the book published in 2007) to gain a full picture of Tolkien's total imagination of Turin's tragic story.    \\"The Lays of Beleriand\\" is one of the three or four most important volumes in \\"The History of Middle-earth,\\" and is my own personal sentimental favorite of all of J. R. R. Tolkien's books.	2003-01-02

Was he of the Gods?"	\\"The Book of Lost Tales, Part 1\\" is the first of two volumes containing the very first versions J.R.R. Tolkien wrote of the legends that ultimately formed \\"The Silmarillion\\". He began writing these stories during World War I, and his quest for perfection in their form and presentation was so rigorous that he was unable to publish any version of \\"The Silmarillion\\" before his death in 1973. His son Christopher edited \\"The Silmarillion\\" for publication and followed it up with thirteen more volumes of his father's writings on Middle-earth and Valinor: \\"Unfinished Tales\\" and the mammoth twelve-volume series \\"The History of Middle-earth,\\" of which \\"The Book of Lost Tales\\" comprises the first two volumes.<br />\\"The Silmarillion\\" itself fails to appeal to many readers of \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" and the thirteen tomes that followed it will have even less appeal to such readers (except perhaps for the four volumes that show how Tolkien went about writing LotR). However, for Tolkien aficionados the History series (affectionately abbreviated HoMe) is essential reading, and \\"The Book of Lost Tales, Part 1\\" is not only its beginning but one of its most important volumes. In it are found versions of the early stories of \\"The Silmarillion\\" (the birth of the Two Trees, the coming of the Elves to Valinor, the flight of the Noldoli or Gnomes, later renamed the Noldor by Tolkien, into exile, and the making of the Sun and Moon) which are far fuller than any later versions written by Tolkien, but the plots and nomenclature of which are still far from evolving into their final forms. Reading these stories is necessary to gain a full appreciation of the beauty of Valinor and of the Trees, the Elves' longing for which underlies all of Tolkien's work.<br />Even those readers who dislike \\"The Silmarillion\\" should seek out this book in their local libraries for the sake of the first few pages of Christopher Tolkien's introduction, in which he explains the peculiar nature of \\"The Silmarillion\\" and why it inevitably has a different sort of appeal than that of \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" and thus may put off readers who enjoy the latter work. For Tolkien fans, \\"The Book of Lost Tales, Part 1\\" is highly recommended reading.	2002-11-06
US	49564064	RE1BHHJUCYSHV	0395939461	619220705	The Silmarillion	Books	5	457	486	N	N	A fantasy classic, but not for everyone	&quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is perhaps the most unique and difficult-to-explain book I have read.  It is among the books I love the most, but this might not be the case if I had not read it in a bizarre way that I can hardly recommend to anyone else, and yet may be the best way to read it.  For ten or twelve years I skimmed through &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; and many of Tolkien's posthumous books (many of which present the stories of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; in different forms which Tolkien wrote at various times in his life) without reading the books verbatim.  Only in the last twelve months have I read these books all the way through.<br />This was a wise way of approaching Tolkien's most famous works because of the odd nature of &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; which must be understood by anyone desiring to enjoy it.  &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is not a &quot;novel,&quot; as are &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (Tolkien preferred the word &quot;romance&quot; to &quot;novel&quot; for LotR).  &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is well described by the subtitle on the front of the jacket of the Ted Nasmith-illustrated edition:  &quot;The Myths and Legends of Middle-earth&quot;.  &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is the equivalent, for the imaginary world in which &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; take place, of a work like Hamilton's or Bulfinch's &quot;Mythology&quot;.  It does not tell one single story; rather it tells many stories in a briefer form, almost as though the stories are being synopsized rather than told.  In a real sense &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is a greater work than even &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; could ever be, since it contains not one but several stories with as much power and grandeur as that of LotR.<br />However, much of the book is written in the style of a tome of history, setting out the vast historical framework within which these unforgettable stories unfold, and thus seems dry and soporific to many readers.  Moreover, large numbers of characters, often with similar names (seven important Elven characters have names starting with F, and six of them start with the letters &quot;Fin&quot;), are presented without space for them to be strongly characterized, so that the reader may be unable to become as engaged with them as with Frodo, Sam or Gandalf.  This is where my bizarre manner of reading the book came in handy:  I became familiar with all the characters over my years of skimming, and knew precisely who they were and how they were connected to each other when I finally read the whole book.  Moreover, since I had often skimmed &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; before reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; I could appreciate the many references back to the former work in the latter.  Although &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; was not published until many years after LotR, Tolkien had written all the stories that make up &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; before writing LotR.  Many of LotR's references to past events, which contribute greatly to the impression it gives of taking place in a real world, are references to events told in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;.  (No Hobbits appear or are mentioned in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; until the last three pages of the book, when the events of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are briefly described at the end of a section that explains how the events of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; ultimately led to the events of those books.)<br />In my opinion, the creation myth with which &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; opens is one of the most intellectually and emotionally satisfying creation stories I have ever read; the chapter &quot;Of Turin Turambar&quot; presents a heroic tragedy comparable in grandeur to a Wagner opera and in depth and power of sorrow to a tragic opera such as &quot;Il Trovatore&quot; or &quot;Tosca&quot;; and thechapter &quot;Of Beren and Luthien&quot; presents Tolkien's very best story of all, perhaps the most unforgettable tale of love and adventure written in the twentieth century.  But for readers to appreciate these treasures, they must be aware in advance of the unusual nature of &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; and not expect a fantasy adventure novel, a mere &quot;prequel&quot; to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.  These are the stories that are told in Frodo's world; they are to Frodo, Sam and Strider what &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is to us:  a saga of a vanished world of heartbreaking beauty, glimmers of which we can still see if we look hard enough.<br />(Some of Ted Nasmith's illustrations are better than others.  The image of Luthien dancing in the wood is one of the best Tolkien-inspired paintings I've ever seen, especially since it leaves the ineffable beauty of Luthien's face to our imaginations.  On the other hand, Galadriel's brother Finrod is not depicted as nearly good-looking enough in the painting of him singing by the campfire of the first Men to come into Beleriand.)	2002-11-01

Someone who has read and been enthralled by the first two volumes of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" might fear that J.R.R. Tolkien could not possibly have written an ending for his great fantasy epic that measures up to what has preceded it.  Such a fear would be groundless.  \\"The Return of the King\\" is a nearly perfect, fully satisfying conclusion to one of the best-loved stories of the twentieth century.<br />Tolkien has been accused by some of not being good at character development, and yet by the time the reader reaches the opening chapters of \\"The Return of the King\\" he or she loves all the main characters of Tolkien's story and knows them as well as old friends.  In my opinion, the explanation of this paradox is that Tolkien, in his presentation of his characters, is the antithesis of a writer like Charles Dickens (whose works I also love).  The hobbits, Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, and the rest of Tolkien's cast of characters do not burst with exaggerated personality the instant we meet them, as do Pecksniff, Scrooge and Micawber.  Their personalities are revealed to us slowly and steadily as they experience their adventures, so that we come to know them gradually, as we would come to know real people.  A reader glancing at almost any individual page in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" might think Tolkien's characters are not very distinctive or strongly characterized, yet the cumulative effect of the whole long story is to fix an indelible impression of each character in our minds.  This process is completed in \\"The Return of the King,\\" in which the characters -- especially the hobbits -- reveal new levels of heroism and wisdom previously unguessed-at.<br />All the themes that Tolkien has raised in the first two installments of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" -- the horror of war balanced against the necessity of just war, the dilemma of capital punishment, the senselessness of environmental destruction, the reality of both evil and good, cruelty and heroism -- are resolved and clarified in \\"The Return of the King\\" in a profound, often heartbreaking, and entirely satisfying way.  The marvelous, complicated plot of this epic story is resolved in a powerful, surprising and yet logical climax.  This climax is followed by several concluding chapters containing some more surprises -- both pleasant and unpleasant -- and some of the most beautiful writing you'll ever read.  Indeed, the final chapter of all, which brings the story to an unforgettably bittersweet conclusion, is so perfectly written that one would not wish to change a single sentence or word.<br />\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is undoubtedly one of the best novels in any genre ever written by anyone, and Peter Jackson's adaptation of it into a movie trilogy is to be commended for attracting many new readers to Tolkien's book.ied in \\"The Return of the King\\" in a profound, often heartbreaking, and entirely satisfying way.

This is not the case with \\"The Two Towers,\\" which lives up to its status as the second of the three volumes of J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" by being the true heart of the entire work.<br />After the death of a major character (an event depicted at the end of Peter Jackson's film adaptation of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\"), Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli search for Merry and Pippin, who have been captured by Orcs.  The Three Hunters, as they call themselves, encounter a major plot surprise, meet several new characters and take part in an enormous battle before finding their friends, who have escaped their captors and encountered Treebeard, a kindly Ent, or \\"tree-herd,\\" who looks something like a walking, talking tree.  Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are joined on their journey to Mordor by the sinister, conflicted Gollum, a background presence in \\"Fellowship\\" who now steps into the spotlight.<br />The scenes in the first half of the book with the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli develop their characters and their unlikely friendship to an extent not found in \\"Fellowship.\\"  Tall and short, pointy-eared and gruffly emotional, Legolas and Gimli are both the C3PO and R2D2 and the Spock and McCoy of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"; their contest to see who can kill the most Orcs during the Battle of Helm's Deep is gruesome yet delightful.  The star of the second half of the book, however, is Gollum, and his interactions with Frodo and Sam serve to define their characters more strongly than before.  Imagine that you and your best friend are on a long, dangerous journey with a disgusting, dangerous creature who desperately wants something your friend has and would kill to get it.  All your life you have heard the story of how your friend's uncle got this object from the creature and barely escaped from him alive.  You never expected to meet or even see the creature yourself, but here he is in the wilderness with you, having sworn to serve your friend.  Now you wish the two of you could get rid of the creature -- but you need his help to reach your destination and thus save the entire world.  That's the situation Sam Gamgee finds himself in, and the resulting interplay between Sam, Frodo and Gollum makes for great drama.  In the book version of \\"Fellowship\\" Gandalf tells Frodo that Gollum both hates and loves himself; readers of \\"The Two Towers\\" will come both to love and hate Gollum.  It's no wonder that when the Beatles were planning to make a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie starring themselves, John Lennon apparently desired the role of Gollum, considering it the starring role of the whole story.<br />If you've enjoyed the book or the movie of \\"Fellowship,\\" you should enjoy reading \\"The Two Towers\\" and finding out what happens next.  Even if it were not the central third of one of the great novels of the twentieth century, \\"The Two Towers\\" would be one of the world's greatest fantasies in its own right.  However, be sure to have a copy of \\"The Return of the King\\" handy when you finish \\"The Two Towers,\\" which, unlike \\"Fellowship,\\" ends with a fairly spectacular cliffhanger...ture yourself, but here he is in the wilderness with you, having sworn to serve your friend.

In many ways this children's version, although shorter and less detailed, is more interesting than the adult version.  The \\"Insiders' Guide\\" contains some information not included in the \\"Movie Guide,\\" such as the \\"Loom!\\" story mentioned by another reviewer below.  Indeed, in general the emphasis of the \\"Insiders' Guide\\" seems to be a bit less on the production design of the movie, and more on the process of filming it and the experience of being on the set, than that of the \\"Movie Guide.\\"<br />One interesting feature of Sibley's text as compared to that of the \\"Movie Guide\\" is that the chapters of the \\"Insiders' Guide\\" tend to begin with especially intriguing sentences intended to grab the reader's attention.  Perhaps Sibley thinks this is more necessary when writing for children than for adults; I consider it a good technique when writing for any audience.  (\\"Apollo 13,\\" formerly called \\"Lost Moon,\\" by James Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger, is an excellent example of the use of this technique in a non-fiction book for adults.)<br />Tolkien fans, and those moviegoers who have fallen in love with Peter Jackson's film, may well want to collect all four movie tie-in books:  this \\"Insiders' Guide\\" and the \\"Photo Guide\\" (both intended for children) along with the \\"Movie Guide\\" and the \\"Visual Companion\\" (both intended for adults).  Young readers seeking paperback books about the movie will find both the \\"Insiders' Guide\\" and the \\"Photo Guide\\" fairly good choices; the \\"Insiders' Guide\\" provides information about the movie's production and the background behind it, while the \\"Photo Guide\\" is the better bet for images from the film.	2002-01-22

Fortunately, the release of Peter Jackson's excellent film adaptation of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" gives me a fresh perspective from which to review J.R.R. Tolkien's novel.<br />If you enjoyed the movie, you should read the book, which you will almost certainly also enjoy, even if in a different way.  One of the glories of Jackson's film is its great richness and depth, the feeling it gives the viewer of stepping into an unfamiliar but real world with a long history.  The reason Jackson's film is able to produce this effect is that the world in which it takes place had already been created, and imagined in almost unbelievable detail, by J.R.R. Tolkien.  Far more even than the movie, Tolkien's book lets the reader share the hobbits' experience of wandering out of their doors into a world with a detailed and believable history, a multitude of different mortal and immortal races with distinct cultures and languages, and a well-defined geography (maps are included in the book).  I must place special emphasis on the linguistic depth of Tolkien's world:  Tolkien, a distinguished philologist, invented around fifteen languages for the inhabitants of his imaginary world to speak.  (The \\"Star Trek\\" Universe, by contrast, contains only one language, Klingon, which has been devised in any detail.)<br />Moreover, as with any cinematic adaptation of a work of literature, Jackson's movie leaves out characters, events and scenes from the book.  These elements are waiting in Tolkien's text for fans of the movie to discover them.  In particular, the chapters involving a character named Tom Bombadil are among the best parts of the book, although they had to be left out of the movie to keep it down to a reasonable length.<br />Anyone who has not yet seen the movie should certainly read the book first; it's best if you imagine the characters and events of the book yourself and then compare your visions to the movie version.<br />Like the movie, Tolkien's book is often astonishingly relevant to our post-September 11 world.  The film's exchange between Frodo and Gandalf in which Frodo wishes the Shadow of evil had not arisen in his time comes directly from the book, which also contains a few other moments that resonate strongly with the current world situation.  Tolkien was writing \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" during World War II, but he did not intend it as an allegory of that war or of any other specific situation; rather, he hoped that readers would feel free to find his work applicable to any scenario they might see reflected in it.<br />\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is, in fact, not a novel, but the first volume of the three-part novel \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Anyone who reads the book and sees the movie of \\"Fellowship\\" will surely want to read the two subsequent volumes, \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King,\\" to find out what happens to the characters without having to wait for the release of the two subsequent movies at Christmas in 2002 and 2003.yone who has not yet seen the movie should certainly read the book first; it's best if you imagine the characters and events of the book yourself and then compare your visions to the movie version.<br />Like the movie, Tolkien's book is often astonishingly relevant to our post-September 11 world.

However, this does not mean that adult fans of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; who already have the &quot;Visual Companion&quot; will not want this book as well, since each book has many beautiful photos and quotations from the movie's script not included in the other.<br />Unlike the &quot;Visual Companion,&quot; this book is arranged more as a bare-bones synopsis of the film's story, so that the action sequence on Weathertop, for example, is represented by a two-page photograph.  The book nonetheless avoids major spoilers for young people who have not read Tolkien's book, saying only that the Fellowship &quot;pays a terrible price for their escape from Moria&quot; and not revealing anything that happens after the Fellowship leaves Lothlorien.<br />Unfortunately, many of the copies of this book I saw at my local bookstore had some sort of printing problem on the first page devoted to Lothlorien, with dark ink spattered over the page.  If you buy this book in a bookstore, I suggest that you check whether the books have this problem and, if so, search for one in which the problem is as minor as possible.

For those who are first being introduced to J.R.R. Tolkien's world by the release of &quot;Fellowship&quot; in movie theaters, however, this book will provide a fascinating, detailed look at how Jackson and company brought Tolkien's book to life on the screen.  The photographs in the book are also very nice; I'm especially fond of those of Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, which show that the movie's hairstylists have superbly captured Tolkien's textual descriptions of Galadriel's lustrous, golden hair.  I also love the title-page photo, a two-page, moody closeup of a thoughtful Peter Jackson.<br />One slight annoyance is the book's title, since it covers the production of the first film, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; not the entire trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;; apparently, similar books will be published for each of the two subsequent films.	2001-12-04

For Tolkien fanatics it serves as both a visual and literary preview of the movie, with its gorgeous photographs and brief quotations from the movie's script.  It also confirms a few of the rumors about the changes made to the story in the movie (e.g., Rosie Cotton appearing as a barmaid in the Shire sequence or the hobbits getting their swords from Strider rather than from the Barrow-wight, who is omitted from the film) and informs the reader of one or two more changes of which I was previously unaware (such as the Dwarves' Rings being kept safe rather than seized by Sauron or destroyed by dragons as in the book).

How lovely!"	\\"The Wonderful World of Oz\\" is one of the few completely faithful dramatic adaptations of works by L. Frank Baum, the author of \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" ever to be produced. It is an audio adaptation of Baum's first five Oz books -- \\"Wizard\\" and the first four of the thirteen sequels he wrote to \\"Wizard.\\" Like any adaptation it contains a few changes, but they are tiny -- to give Oz fans an idea of their magnitude, the biggest change in the whole set of tapes is that the Woggle-Bug is inexplicably called the \\"Woogle-Bug\\" throughout.    There are few or no weak links in the cast. The performers who appear as Dorothy and the Scarecrow deserve special praise, but there were only two or three performers I couldn't warm up to, and others may feel differently. Amy Strack's Dorothy is almost in the same league as those of Judy Garland and Fairuza Balk (in Disney's \\"Return to Oz\\"); her interpretation of the role, however, is quite different from theirs. Strack's Dorothy is only seldom tearful and sentimental like Garland's, and never somber and introspective like Balk's. She is cheerful, determined, and courageous in the face of every situation -- a wonderful role model for young girls. Strack even manages to make Dorothy sound older in each successive story (since the five books adapted by this production take place over several years; Dorothy probably ages from about 6 to about 10). \\"Wonderful World\\" was recorded over only six months, so this subtle but wonderful effect is due to Strack's skill as an actress. As a fan of the Oz books, I recognize Strack's Dorothy as Baum's own conception of the character at last brought to life.    One of \\"Wonderful World\\"'s greatest glories is Jeffrey Gage's memorable musical score. Certainly one of its greatest moments comes when Dorothy and her friends first enter the Emerald City and the music by itself manages to convey the City's beauty and glory. The sound effects and stereo production are also superb -- for the full effect, listen to this set on headphones.    \\"Wonderful World\\" **is** wonderful, like the books on which it is based. Buy it for your children, for your library, for anywhere where children with access to a tape recorder will find it. It represents a kind of beauty, hope and love that we need now more than ever before.	2001-09-15

Even after reading Dante's &quot;Divine Comedy,&quot; I'm not sure Wolfe's book has been dislodged from its position.<br />Wolfe begins to work his literary magic on the first page.  A young, beautiful woman is worried about her husband, a Navy test pilot, having heard that there has been a plane crash.  Space buffs like me reading the book are fascinated to realize that the woman is Jane Conrad, wife of Pete Conrad (which, incidentally, tells us that the bad news that day won't be about her husband).  If this scene appeared in a different book about the space program, even one as superb as Andrew Chaikin's &quot;A Man on the Moon&quot; or Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger's &quot;Apollo 13,&quot; the account of events, while exciting and suspenseful, would remain on a somewhat mundane plane of everyday reality.  Wolfe's glittering, idiosyncratic literary style lifts events into a world of super-reality.  We experience Jane Conrad's concern and dread as if we were Jane Conrad.  Perhaps more than any other book I have read, &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; has caused me to remember the events it relates as if I lived through them rather than reading about them.<br />One noteworthy feature of Wolfe's style in this book is his nearly Wagnerian use of verbal &quot;leitmotiven,&quot; key phrases which pop up over and over in the book and come to convey far more than the simple content of the words.  Anyone who has read the book will remember for a long time Wolfe's use of such phrases as &quot;bad streak,&quot; &quot;Flying and Drinking and Drinking and Driving,&quot; &quot;the Integral,&quot; &quot;our rockets always blow up,&quot; &quot;the Presbyterian Pilot,&quot; &quot;single combat warrior,&quot; &quot;ziggurat,&quot; and, of course, &quot;the right stuff.&quot;<br />The book also contains the funniest set-piece in any book I have ever read, the description of thecelebration when the astronauts and their families first visit Houston, including the fan dance by the ancient Sally Rand.  Interestingly, in the excellent film version of the book this scene was transformed from a hilarious comedy sequence into something elegiac, intercut with the sequence of Chuck Yeager bailing out of a plane (which happened on a different day in reality and in the book) to create drama and suspense.  In this radically different form the two sequences are just as effective in the movie as they are in the book.<br />&quot;The Right Stuff&quot; has sometimes been criticized for being overly fictionalized, or at least speculative.  These criticisms probably have a great deal of validity, but they do not alter the fact that &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; is the definitive evocation of that brief era around 1960 when almost anything, good or bad, seemed possible.  It is an unforgettable literary achievement.	2001-05-09

No other science fiction novel is quite like it in its thrilling realism; one can easily believe that a sequence of events similar to that in the book could begin taking place tomorrow.  The book is filled with a plethora of wonderful plot twists, fascinating details of scientific fact and speculation, and unexpected bits of characterization that only Sagan could have thought to include.  Sagan, who apparently considered himself a &quot;spiritual agnostic,&quot; explored religious as well as scientific issues in this work, and the result is arguably heretical if seen from a traditional religious standpoint -- but not heretical in the specific way a reader might initially expect.  Indeed, the story's climactic twist makes &quot;Contact&quot; into a twentieth-century equivalent of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; -- a work which, while subtly heretical, is one of the most awe-inspiringly religious books ever written.<br />Jodie Foster's reading of &quot;Contact&quot; on this recording is absolutely superb.  She differentiates between the voices of all the characters and her own voice as narrator -- even her voice for Ellie Arroway, the character she played in the movie of &quot;Contact,&quot; is a subtly more energetic and characterful version of her normal voice.  Foster also employs about seven different accents (counting her usual American accent) in the course of the recording, moving effortlessly from one to another when characters from several different countries have conversations.  At one point, when Sagan's text describes a character as having an almost (but not quite) non-existent Russian accent, Foster even manages to produce exactly that!  She also evokes all the varying moods of the story, conveying Sagan's sense of awe and wonder at the beauty and majesty of the universe.  Foster's performance on this recording is probably the best reading of a book which I have ever heard.<br />I listened to this recording over several nights, and was in suspense from one night to the next, wondering what would happen next.  This superb example of the intelligence and artistry of Carl Sagan and Jodie Foster is highly recommended.  Six out of five stars.	2000-12-21

At that time I had read only a few Oz books (now I have read almost all of them), but I felt deeply sorry that this book was unavailable for me to read.  Now, at last, thanks to the efforts of Eric Shanower (who edited and illustrated the book), we can read this long-lost volume of Oz history.    It certainly is an interesting book, and forms an exciting conclusion to Neill's four-book tenure as Royal Historian.  Scraps, the Patchwork Girl, decides to run away from the Emerald City and find a new home, and the book details her adventures with the new friends she makes, as well as those of Jenny Jump, Professor Wogglebug and Jack Pumpkinhead, who go searching for her.  Among her new friends is Alexample, a young boy who is TAG (Talented and Gifted); this is a highly noteworthy feature of the book, since I could count on one hand the number of other children's authors I know of who have depicted gifted children in their books, thus leaving gifted children (of whom I was one) with a paucity of literary role models.  (Meg and Charles Wallace in Madeleine L'Engle's Time Trilogy and Claudia in E. L. Konigsburg's \\"From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\\" were among the welcome exceptions.)    Neill's style of writing is highly cinematic and visual, as might be expected from the greatest Oz illustrator; thinking back to reading this book, I feel almost as though I had seen it as a movie rather than reading it.  The gorgeous illustrations by Eric Shanower contribute to this impression; Shanower certainly is the most talented person illustrating Oz books today.    One slight quibble with Neill's tale concerns the characterization of the Wogglebug:  in no other Oz book is he quite so unlikeable as here (although still not extremely unlikeable).  Also,I must agree with \\"The Baum Bugle\\"'s reviewer, who wished Shanower had explained the extent to which he had to work on the book's text.  The story's tone is somewhat more serious than was that of Neill's previous three Oz books, though that might be due to Neill's failing health while writing \\"Runaway\\" (something similar happened with Baum's last few Oz books) or to the lack of interference by a Reilly & Lee editor who, I understand, heavily revised Neill's earlier Oz books.    However, one aspect of the book that is quite atypical of Neill is the excellence of its continuity.  There are practically no mistakes when the book refers to characters or events from earlier Oz books, and the characterizations are almost completely consistent with the depictions of the same characters in earlier Oz books by Neill and others.  Neill's other books are well-known for having the worst continuity in the whole Oz series, with such egregious mistakes as Jack Pumpkinhead remembering being enslaved by Mombi for many years (which never happened) and the introduction of Scraps' never-before-displayed propensity for punching people (which she does again at one point in this book, but that is simply an example of consistency with Neill's previous books, and otherwise her personality is exactly as depicted by Baum and Thompson).  One has to wonder whether Neill's manuscript contained continuity errors which Shanower corrected.    Nonetheless, the availability of this book after so many years is cause for rejoicing among all Oz fans here in the Great Outside World.	2000-09-27

(Our Secret Gang)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	An enjoyable book, but exercises artistic license	First of all, the books in this series are among the few children's books that feature a gifted child as one of the characters, and Gilligan is to be applauded for that.  I think, however, that potential readers of this book should be aware that it takes major liberties with the real layout of the Boston Museum of Science, where it takes place.  A comparison of the map of the Museum in the book with a real map of the Museum shows this clearly.  In fact, even the title of the book is a piece of artistic license; there is no Brontosaurus Room at the Boston Museum of Science.  I was also shocked by how much the Secret Gang charged for their services as detectives; I forget exactly how much it was, but I think it was a few dollars.  This is a far cry from Encyclopedia Brown's fee of 25 cents a day plus expenses.  (Come to think of it, Encyclopedia must have been a gifted child, but I don't think Donald Sobol ever explicitly said so.)  Nevertheless, this is a highly entertaining and educational book.	2000-09-27

As Snow himself hoped to do, he improved greatly on his previous Oz book, the highly enjoyable &quot;The Magical Mimics in Oz.&quot;  The book is clearly the creation of a true aficionado of L. Frank Baum's writing; like &quot;Magical Mimics&quot; it closely approximates Baum's plotting style, and the style of the prose itself, while close to Baum's, attains its own delightful distinctiveness.  One noteworthy feature of this book is the highly dramatic endings of several of the chapters, beginning with the first one; these endings are cliffhangers which compel the reader to continue reading.  &quot;Shaggy Man&quot; deserves classic status among the Oz books, and is recommended to Oz fans everywhere.  (Note that &quot;Shaggy Man&quot; contains precisely one reference to a character from &quot;Magical Mimics,&quot; and none whatsoever to characters or events from any of Thompson's or Neill's books (as is also true of &quot;Magical Mimics&quot;); thus &quot;Shaggy Man&quot; can be read and enjoyed by anyone who has read several of Baum's Oz books.)	2000-09-27

If a plot-your-own book was going to be released to tie in with Ron Howard's &quot;Apollo 13,&quot; one might have expected that one of the real astronauts--Jim Lovell, perhaps--would be the character for whom the reader makes choices.  Instead, Aber has the reader as a child living in 1970 who, in order to test a marvelous invention s/he has created, is allowed to fly on board Apollo 13 with the three astronauts.  The events that ensue are, inevitably, educational for readers, but one should keep in mind that no child has ever yet been allowed to fly in space, let alone in 1970, on the third moon-landing mission, in an era when the astronaut corps was dominated by former test pilots and even the adult scientist-astronauts had great difficulty getting seats on spacecraft.  And yet the astronauts in this book show not the slightest resentment or hostility toward the reader, instead welcoming him/her with open arms.  I do recommend this book as an educational and entertaining work for children, but they should realize how utterly impossible its storyline is in a world where even John Glenn's return to space was highly controversial.	2000-09-27

Frank Baum's Oz books, &quot;The Tin Woodman of Oz&quot; has an effortless sense of memorability about it which not all Oz authors have been able to attain.  It raises more interesting philosophical  problems about identity and the nature of love than do most of the Oz  books, and is, like most of Baum's writing, gently humorous and optimistic  about the world and human nature.  Some of the plot twists in the latter  part of the book, which concern the repercussions of Nick Chopper's  transformation into a Tin Woodman, may be disturbing for some young  readers; but the questions these events raise are fascinating and could  lead children into interesting discussions with their parents about what  makes a person himself.  Books of Wonder's beautiful edition includes all  of John R. Neill's illustrations, including the endpapers and the color  plates; this is the only one of the &quot;Famous Forty&quot; Oz books to  include illustrations of the Wicked Witch of the East, of the Tin Woodman's  long-lost love Nimmie Amee, and of the Tin Woodman himself as he appeared  when he was a normal &quot;meat&quot; man.

In many ways this is more of a summing-up of Thompson's style  and the unique elements she brought to the Oz series than any of her three  later Oz books.  In fact, like &quot;Captain Salt in Oz&quot;, this book  features only Thompson's own characters and none of Baum's, although unlike  &quot;Captain Salt&quot; parts of the story do take place in the Land of  Oz.  &quot;Silver Princess&quot; contains many beautiful and highly  memorable moments and a unique and fascinating personality in its title  character: Planetty, the Princess of Anuther (sic) Planet.  Despite a major  plot hole at the very end of the story--how do the characters cross the  Deadly Desert on their return to Oz?--this book is highly enjoyable.	2000-06-27

It is the perfect exemplar of Neill's unique, risk-taking style of Oz book writing.   At one point about six or seven storylines are going on at the same time!   This book also contains such classic moments as Tik-Tok falling off the top  of a mountain, the Cowardly Lion bursting into tears out of pity for the  Scalawagons when he learns they're lost, even though he doesn't know what  they are, and the most ineffectual and yet entertaining of the many  invasions the Emerald City has experienced.

The first time I read this book I realized that it was the  best Oz book I had ever read, and I still think so.  It has everything one  could possibly desire in an Oz book--humor, suspense, a deeply intriguing  storyline that clears up mysteries that go back to &quot;The Wizard of  Oz,&quot; and material that deepens our understanding of nearly all the  characters.  Thompson's depictions of Baum's characters were somewhat  different from Baum's but still consistent with them, just as her style was  different from Baum's but equally well suited to writing Oz books; in this  book both her characterizations and her style get off to a flying start.   If, as one reviewer said, she improved in later Oz books, why did she keep  featuring Sir Hokus, Doubty and Camy (whom I consider excellent characters)  rather than letting them fade out of the series?  Also, I must disagree  with the reviewer who feels that the Wogglebug was always perfectly kind  and sweet.  Even Baum depicts him as having a self-satisfied,  intellectually superior side to his personality.  In this book he does hurt  the Scarecrow's feelings, but clearly does not realize how deeply hurtful  his comments will be; and Thompson makes clear at the end of the book that  the Wogglebug feels profoundly sorry for what he did.  The Oz book that  truly contains an overly unpleasant depiction of Professor Wogglebug is  John R. Neill's &quot;The Runaway in Oz&quot; (which was not published  until the 1990's, when it was published by Books of Wonder).  To sum up,  &quot;The Royal Book of Oz&quot; is my favorite Oz book, and it amazes me  that it was Ruth Plumly Thompson's very first book in the series (and, I  think, her first novel of any kind)!	2000-05-29

(Our Secret Gang)	Books	4	0	1	N	N	An enjoyable book, but exercises artistic licence	First of all, the books in this series are among the few children's books that feature a gifted child as one of the characters, and Gilligan is to be applauded for that.  I think, however, that potential readers of this book  should be aware that it takes major liberties with the real layout of the  Boston Museum of Science, where it takes place.  A comparison of the map of  the Museum in the book with a real map of the Museum shows this clearly.   In fact, even the title of the book is a piece of artistic licence: there  is no Brontosaurus Room at the Boston Museum of Science.  I was also  shocked by how much the Secret Gang charged for their services as  detectives; I forget exactly how much it was, but I think it was a few  dollars.  This is a far cry from Encyclopedia Brown's fee of 25 cents a day  plus expenses.  (Come to think of it, Encyclopedia must have been a gifted  child, but I don't think Donald Sobol ever explicitly said so.)   Nevertheless, this is a highly entertaining and educational book.	2000-05-08
