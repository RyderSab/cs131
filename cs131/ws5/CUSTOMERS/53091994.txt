Courtwright (Harvard University Press, 277 pp, $24.95) is a vivid account of the global spread of psychoactive drugs over the last 500 years. The University of North Florida historian defines drugs broadly enough to include not just the usual suspects like heroin and marijuana, but also generally legal drugs such as tobacco, alcohol and caffeine. <br /> <br />Courtwright's witty writing should appeal to those with a taste for black humor. The author possesses a seemingly infinite supply of vivid examples about the impact of drugs on humanity, and even upon the animal kingdom. Lions, he notes, \\"have learned to prey upon drunks staggering home at night from East African roadside bars.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Forces of Habit\\" can help modern white-collar workers banned from smoking indoors reflect on the ferocious anti-smoking campaigns that earlier tobacco addicts endured. While American smokers are forced to risk pneumonia each winter while they puff away in the freezing doorways of office buildings, \\"Russian smokers suffered beatings and exile; snuff takers had their noses torn off. Chinese smokers had their heads impaled on pikes. Turkish smokers under the reign of Ahmed I endured pipe stems thrust through their noses.\\" <br /> <br />Ironies abound in \\"Forces of Habit.\\" Alcoholics Anonymous' co-founders, Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith, \\"both smoked heavily and died of cigarette-related illnesses.\\" (Today, AA chapters searching for meeting places are bedeviled by the new prohibitions on indoor smoking. Reformed alcoholics often want to smoke to relieve the tension of staying on the wagon.) <br /> <br />But Courtwright has serious ambitions as well. <br /> <br />\\"This book,\\" he writes, \\"grew out of a broader curiosity about psychoactive commerce, a ubiquitous -- and, I now believe, defining -- feature of the modern world.\\" <br /> <br />This leads Courtwright to rewrite much of human history from a, well, drugocentric viewpoint. \\"The domestication of fire,\\" he informs us, \\"made widespread drug use possible in the first place.\\" A few eons later, \\"The Apollo 11 astronauts,\\" he notes, \\"were drinking coffee three hours after landing on the moon.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Forces of Habit\\" is thus in the grand tradition of the Monomaniacal School of History. It stands comparison to such valuable works as William McNeill's \\"Plagues and Peoples\\" and Daniel Yergin's \\"The Prize,\\" which explained the history of the world in terms of germs and oil, respectively. <br /> <br />Courtwright's vast goals are assisted by his defining \\"psychoactive drug\\" expansively enough to include coffee and chocolate. He even tentatively discusses sugar. I'm not sure why he didn't ultimately accept sugar as \\"psychoactive.\\" Those of us with little kids have certainly seen sugar's impact on brain chemistry. <br /> <br />One problem with his semi-sprawling approach to defining \\"psychoactive drugs\\" is that it's not clear where to draw the line. If I drink a glass of warm milk to help me fall asleep, does that make milk psychoactive? Or would it be \\"psychodeactive?\\" <br /> <br />When going on a family outing, I always insist that we bring along some high-calorie, high-fat foods like cheese sticks. Few things end screaming tantrums faster than cheese. And it helps mellow out my kids, too. So, is cheese a psychoactive drug, just like crack and crank? <br /> <br />What about sunshine? The vitamin D it produces seldom fails to cheer me up. <br /> <br />Is a tan also a drug? <br /> <br />Evidently, Courtwright defines a drug as a chemical that wasn't around for most of human evolution. He takes a Darwinian perspective on the desire for drugs. <br /> <br />\\"Humans evolved in itinerant band societies. Life in the sedentary peasant societies that succeeded them was less varied, fulfilling, egalitarian and healthful. Taking drugs to get through the daily grind (or to treat the intestinal and parasitic diseases attendant to settled life) is peculiar to civilization. ... Such practices are further clues, if any are needed, that our social circumstances are out of sync with our evolved natures.\\" <br /> <br />Drugs apparently produce artificially the pleasurable brain chemistry reactions that evolution devised to reward our distant caveman ancestors for engaging in hunting and other behaviors essential to survival. Perhaps this explains the terrible alcoholism problems currently suffered by the indigenous tribes -- such as American Indians, Eskimos and Australian aborigines -- who have only recently given up the primordial hunter-gatherer lifestyle. <br /> <br />Of course, New World Indians had their own native drugs to share with Columbus. According to Courtwright's bottomless bag of memorable quotes, the fanatically anti-smoking and anti-drinking Adolf Hitler called tobacco, \\"the wrath of the Red Man against the White Man, vengeance for having been given hard liquor.\\" (Perhaps, though, Hitler showed that power is the most dangerous drug of all.) <br /> <br />Courtwright dislikes drugs, but what he really hates is capitalism. \\"The peculiar, vomitorious genius of modern capitalism,\\" he expounds, \\"is its ability to betray our senses with one class of products or services and then sell us another to cope with the damage so that we can go back to consuming more of what caused the problem in the first place.\\" <br /> <br />Rich merchants and Western European governments generally encouraged drug commerce well into the 19th century. The relatively recent growth of temperance movements and at least partially effective government controls on drugs, Courtwright asserts, were a response to the industrial revolution changing what capitalists required from workers. Before industrialization, landlords could keep fieldworkers in debt-slavery by getting them addicted to expensive alcohol or opium. Drunken factory workers, though, would break expensive machinery. <br /> <br />\\"The growing cost of the abuse of manufactured drugs turned out to be a fundamental contradiction of capitalism,\\" claims Courtwright. On the other hand, one could also argue that the historically high level of sobriety reigning in today's hyper-capitalistic information economy -- where caffeine is the only acceptable drug -- demonstrates that free markets can encourage self-control. <br /> <br />Many economists, most notably Milton Friedman, have suggested legalizing all drugs. They point out that the outlawing of drugs generates crime, just as Prohibition did. <br /> <br />The historian Courtwright, however, believes these economists are living in a theoretical dreamland. The \\"dangers of exposing people to psychoactive substances for which, it is increasingly clear, they lack evolutionary preparation\\" means that the \\"answer, whatever it may be, is not a return to a minimally regulated drug market.\\" <br /> <br />I fear this is true, but I would have liked to have seen Courtwright grapple more directly with the libertarian economists' arguments. Historians love facts, but distrust logic, while economists don't like to mess up their beautiful theories with too much reality. Perhaps someday, a thinker equally at home with both the history and theory of drugs will resolve this crucial quandary. Until then, \\"Forces of Habit\\" makes a fine introduction.	2005-07-31

But Diamond knows that's not true, as his own lactose tolerance illustration demonstrated. <br /> <br />This mutation didn't begin to spread until people started milking animals sometime in the last 13,000 years. However, by now 98 percent of Swedes are lactose tolerant as adults versus two percent of Thais. <br /> <br />This example of human biodiversity is hardly trivial: evolving the ability to digest milk has had a sizable economic and cultural impact on, say, the Swiss. <br /> <br />Self-defeatingly, Diamond began Guns, Germs, and Steel by making a eugenic argument that New Guineans are smarter than whites because \\"natural selection promoting genes for intelligence has probably been far more ruthless in New Guinea than in more densely populated, politically complex societies...\\" <br /> <br />Of course, the virtually tautological reality is actually that while New Guineans are, on average, no doubt better at Stone Age life than you or I would be, people whose ancestors have survived for many generations in \\"densely populated, politically complex societies\\" tend to be better at functioning in \\"densely populated, politically complex societies\\" -- i.e., the modern world. <br /> <br />Diamond lectures but almost never debates. I've only heard of one time when he allowed himself to be dragged into a public discussion with a well-informed opponent (an NPR call-in show with his critic Victor Davis Hanson). <br /> <br />I talked to Diamond once after he gave a speech. We were chatting nicely until I asked him a tough question along the lines outlined above: Wouldn't different agricultural environments select for different hereditary traits in different locales? <br /> <br />I mentioned how James Q. Wilson's \\"The Marriage Problem\\" has a couple of chapters on how tropical agriculture in West Africa affects family structures. Since women can often raise enough food to feed their kids by themselves, men don't invest as much in their individual children. So wouldn't the kind of man with the most surviving children be different in a tropical agricultural environment, where he doesn't need to work too much to support them, than in a temperate agricultural environment, where he does? <br /> <br />Now, Diamond has spent a lot of time birdwatching in New Guinea, which is similar to Africa. So he knows all about what tropical agriculture selects for. But he had no intention of touching that tar-baby with a ten-foot pole. To get away from me and my question, he grabbed his papers and literally dog-trotted at about 5 mph out of the auditorium! <br /> <br />Diamond can run, but he won't be able to hide from the facts forever. I hear there are now several scientific papers in the publication pipeline about racial differences in genes that affect cognition and personality, each comparable in importance to the recent blockbuster paper on the genetic roots of high Ashkenazi Jewish IQ.  <br /> <br />In summary, while there is much good material in GG&S (although it's boringly presented), the political correctness that made Diamond into a media superstar saps the book of usefulness. His more courageous earlier book, \\"The Third Chimpanzee,\\" is, while outdated in places, much more fun and thought-provoking.	2005-07-27
US	53091994	R3CR9RW7BNSMBO	1877275727	172499734	Fair Women, Dark Men: The Forgotten Roots of Color Prejudice	Books	5	48	57	N	N	Lucid, short, and important	A couple of decades ago, I began noticing that the leading lady in a movie was almost always  fairer-skinned than her leading man. <br /> <br />It appears filmmakers and their audiences subconsciously associate lightness of complexion with femininity. Yet, nobody ever seems to talk about it. <br /> <br />Medieval Europeans referred to women as \\"the fair sex,\\" but in contemporary discourse, skin color is associated only with race, not with sex. <br /> <br />We don't behave like that, however.  <br /> <br />Audiences famously want their leading men to look \\"tall, dark, and handsome\\" (a phrase first applied to that epitome of male glamour, Cary Grant) when they embrace their leading ladies. But, apparently, \\"dark\\" is even more important than \\"tall.\\" <br /> <br />My impression is that female fans are more insistent than male fans that their favorite actresses be fair. Conversely, male fans don't much like pale actors, as Jude Law's problems shedding the dreaded \\"pretty boy\\" tag demonstrate. <br /> <br />When the Internet came along in the 1990s, I discovered that an anthropologist at Universit Laval in Quebec named Peter Frost had been researching for years this question of why actresses were so fair, and much else besides. <br /> <br />His findings are quite extraordinary. <br /> <br />He's finally published a lucidly written and wide-ranging book entitled Fair Women, Dark Men: The Forgotten Roots of Color Prejudice. It proves well worth the wait, shedding light on a broad array of contemporary social issues. <br /> <br />It turns out that this favoritism toward lighter skinned women is not an invention of Hollywood. You'll note that conventional \\"social constructionist\\" thinking can't explain this phenomenon. The standard academic's logic would predict that, because whites rule and men rule, therefore the whitest men would be the most popular.  But pallid blonde actors of the James Spader ilk typically play evil preppie-yuppie villains, not heroes.  Conversely, the movie industry is responding to a fondness for fairer females found in almost all cultures across almost all eras. <br /> <br />In his foreword to Fair Women, Dark Men, U. of Washington sociologist Pierre L. van den Berghe, author of one of my favorite books, The Ethnic Phenomenon, summarizes: <br /> <br />\\"Although virtually all cultures express a marked preference for fair female skin, even those with little or no exposure to European imperialism, and even those whose members are heavily pigmented, many are indifferent to male pigmentation or even prefer men to be darker.\\" <br /> <br />Frost reports that out of 51 different cultures in the anthropology profession's famous Human Relations Area Files, 44 cultures favored lighter complexions on either only women (30) or on both sexes (14). In only 3 cultures was fair skin preferred on men only, and in just 4 cultures was darker skin desired. <br /> <br />Lighter ladies were favored in many countries with little exposure to Western beauty standards, such as medieval Japan, Ethiopia, Aztec Mexico, and Moorish Spain, where the dominant culture was darker skinned than the conquered natives. <br /> <br />Frost discovered that the reason women were called \\"the fair sex\\" is because women are indeed fairer on average after puberty. He notes that 50 out of 54 anthropometric studies from around the world have shown that women's untanned skin, such as under the upper arm, reflects more light than men's. Women have more subcutaneous fat, which gives them a lighter look. <br /> <br />The gender difference in color is not large, but before Europeans came into frequent contact with sub-Saharan Africans and others of highly different hues, it was noticeable. Frost writes: <br /> <br />\\"When one's social horizon takes in a limited range of observable skin tones, small gradations of color take on more importance.... A 'white' person was simply a fair-complexioned individual; a 'black' person, a dark-complexioned one. This old way of seeing things persists today in surnames that once referred to the normal range of skin color in Europe, [in] surnames like White, Brown, and Black among the English...\\" <br /> <br />Could it all just be social class prejudice? Traditionally, wealthier women who didn't have to work outdoors could avoid tanning more than poor women who had to slop the hogs. That plays a definite role in maintaining the bias, but the cultural fondness for fairer women is even found among hunter-gatherer tribes where all women have to be outdoors every day finding food. <br /> <br />Frost also points out a corollary of this sexual selection for lightness: <br /> <br />\\"Since higher-ranking men marry the more attractive women, the upper classes tend to lighten in color with each passing generation, as in India.\\" <br /> <br />This seems particularly true in Latin America, where the elites remain quite white-looking despite almost 500 years of intermarriage. The trick is that the most successful short, dark men often wed tall, blonde women and have more European-looking offspring, thus replenishing the caste system. <br /> <br />Frost's short but mind-expanding book shows once again how much more fascinating the study of humanity can be-when freed of the boring old prejudice that biology has nothing to do with human beings.	2005-06-24
US	53091994	R2D6MDG5MFXXRX	1594030863	217993563	Black Rednecks and White Liberals	Books	5	129	151	N	N	Excellent, except for title essay	That Thomas Sowell hasn't yet won the Nobel Prize for Economic Science reflects more poorly upon the economics profession's infatuation with mathematical formulas than upon Sowell's lifetime achievement. Personally, I've learned more from Sowell than from any other living economist, with the possible exception of his old teacher, Milton Friedman. <br /> <br />Now in his mid-70s, Sowell's latest book of essays, Black Rednecks and White Liberals, doesn't break much new ground. But it forcefully summarizes many of his recurrent themes in a half dozen extended meditations on historical issues of great relevance to the contemporary world. <br /> <br />For example, in \\"Are Jews Generic?\\" Sowell outlines the tendency of the masses to persecute \\"middle-man minorities\\" such as Jews, Armenians, and the Overseas Chinese, precisely because of the value of their contributions to the economy. <br /> <br />In \\"Germans and History,\\" he defends that much maligned nationality against insinuations, such as in Daniel Goldhagen's bestseller Hitler's Willing Executioners, that German history should be viewed as inevitably leading up to the Nazis. Sowell concludes, with his characteristic concern for the universal fallibilities of mankind: <br /> <br />\\"The racial fanaticism of Hitler and the Nazi movement ... were not historically distinct characteristics of Germans as a people. On the contrary, the rise of such a man as the leader of such a people should serve as a permanent warning to all people everywhere who are charmed by charisma or aroused by rhetoric.\\" <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the title essay, \\"Black Rednecks and White Liberals,\\" is the most questionable in the book. <br /> <br />Yet it features many acute observations. For example: <br /> <br />\\"By cheering on counterproductive attitudes, making excuses for self-defeating behavior, and promoting the belief that 'racism' accounts for most of blacks' problems, white intellectuals serve their own psychic, ideological, and political interests. They are the kinds of friends who can do more harm than enemies.\\" <br /> <br />The central conceit of the essay is that blacks' troubles today in large part stem from their having absorbed the self-defeating culture of poor Southern whites. <br /> <br />As Sowell wrote in the Wall Street Journal (April 26 2005): <br /> <br />\\"The redneck culture proved to be a major handicap for both whites and blacks who absorbed it. Today, the last remnants of that culture can still be found in the worst of the black ghettos, whether in the North or the South, for the ghettos of the North were settled by blacks from the South. The counterproductive and self-destructive culture of black rednecks in today's ghettos is regarded by many as the only `authentic' black culture -- and, for that reason, something not to be tampered with. Their talk, their attitudes, and their behavior are regarded as sacrosanct.\\" <br /> <br />But when examined closely, Sowell's theory exhibits major problems. Indeed, I suspect Sowell is really trying to get blacks to reject ghetto gangsta culture as not authentically black, but a borrowing from poor white trash. When I explained to my wife what I thought Sowell might be doing, she replied: \\"Hey, if it works, I'm all for it.\\" <br /> <br />There's no question that for scores of years after the Civil War, the South was the poorest, worst educated, and least enterprising part of the country. The fairly rapid improvement in the wealth and health of the South after the spread of air conditioning following WWII, though, suggests that some of what Sowell sees as long-term cultural weaknesses were simply the initiative-sapping effects of too much heat and humidity. <br /> <br />Still, as historian David Hackett Fischer's landmark 1989 book Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America documented in overwhelming detail, the cultural patterns laid down by different groups of British settlers before 1776 still explain much about today's America. <br /> <br />Following Grady McWhiney's book Cracker Culture, Sowell attributes much of \\"redneck culture\\" to the Scotch-Irish, those bellicose Protestants from the violent Scottish-English border region and their descendents who had settled Ulster. During the 17th and 18th Centuries, the Scots-Irish migrated to America, especially to the Appalachian backcountry. <br /> <br />Sowell in turns attributes many aspects of current black culture to the Scotch-Irish, such as a tendency to react tumultuously to being \\"dissed.\\" For example, President Andy Jackson, the exemplar of Scotch-Irish manhood, was admired by his followers for having fought several duels. <br /> <br />Certainly, the Scotch-Irish were more prone to brawl than the two dominant cultures of the 17th Century North, the intellectual Puritans of New England and the pacifist Quakers of Pennsylvania. But those two elite, self-selected religious groups were exceptional. The typical human culture has no doubt been closer to the Scotch-Irish than to the Puritans or Quakers. So correlations between the old Appalachians and the current ghetto-dwellers aren't proof of causation. <br /> <br />Even more damaging to Sowell's hypothesis, the Scotch-Irish tended to stay away from the blacks. They went to the highlands, both because disease was less of a problem for Europeans in the cooler uplands than in the lowland South, and because they disliked having to compete with slave labor. <br /> <br />Today, the state with the least educated whites is the prototypical Scotch-Irish state of West Virginia, which had so few slave-owners that it seceded from Confederate Virginia and joined the Union during the Civil War. Other heavily Scotch-Irish states like Tennessee and Kentucky have limited black populations, too. <br /> <br />Slaves tended to be owned mostly by big slave-owners on the tobacco and cotton plantations of the Southern lowlands. The planters were often descended from the second sons of minor aristocrats in southern England -- just as poor whites in the lowland South often originated among the servant and farm worker classes of southern England. <br /> <br />African-Americans may have assimilated more of the lowland Southern quasi-aristocratic prejudices, such as for grandiloquent multi-syllabic words (e.g., Jesse Jackson's style of speaking) and against manufacturing and shop keeping, than they inherited Scotch-Irish populism. <br /> <br />Consider Liberia. Freed slaves who were sent to Liberia reproduced the white Southern lowland social structure -- with themselves as the slave-owning aristocrats and the native blacks as the slaves.	2005-05-18

I was struck by how incomprehensible the reading test samples were. For instance: <br /> <br />\\"There is an importance of learning communication and meaning in language... Communication in the classroom is vital. The teacher should use communication to help students develop the capacity to make their private responses become public responses.\\" <br /> <br />Huh?  <br /> <br />If you are looking for a single sentence that combines the banal, the barbarous, and the unfathomable, it's hard to beat: \\"There is an importance of learning communication and meaning in language.\\" <br /> <br />The clarity of other passages on the exam could be enhanced by recasting them as, say, dialogue spoken by Shaggy on Scooby-doo. For example,  <br /> <br />\\"In view of the current emphasis on literature-based reading instruction, a greater understanding by teachers of variance in cultural, language, and story components should assist in narrowing the gap between reader and text and improve reading comprehension.

You simply cannot understand the main events of European history of the last century without reading Slezkine' brilliant book. <br /> <br />Slezkine's interest is in the tragic ironies of history and he empathetically allows us to enter into the mindsets of hundreds of individuals as they made decisions that, well, seemed like a good idea at the time. <br /> <br />We've all read enormous amounts about two Jewish migrations -- one to America and one to the Holy Land -- but Slezkine vividly documents the forgotten third Jewish great migration, the one his grandmother made, from the towns of the Pale of Settlement in the Polish and Ukrainian lands to Moscow and the other great cities of Russia/Soviet Union. For at least two decades after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, this migration appeared to the more worldly Jews around the globe as the most successful of the three migrations. Jews, untainted by any association with the Czarist regime and showing the most enthusiasm for the new Bolshevik regime of any ethnic group, flourished in the Soviet Union even more than in America, where anti-Semitism channeled most of the Jewish immigrants' genius into meritocratic fields like entrepreneurial business and science, rather than into politics, the military, or the more comfortable parts of the corporate world.  <br /> <br />In 19th Century Europe, secularizing Jews believed they were hated because of nationalism and capitalism. Nationalism proposed that every nation should have a territorial state, an idea the small minority of Jews who were active Zionists embraced. But most of the new Jewish intelligentsia of Eastern Europe felt that the solution to the Jews' lack of a nation-state in a world obsessed with nationalism was the elimination of nationalism and its replacement by internationalism, which communism promised. Moreover, Jewish intellectuals also believed they were hated because of the Jews' tremendous talent for capitalism, which communism likewise promised to abolish. Finally, many young secular Jews were in rebellion against their capitalist, religious, and particularist parents or grandparents, and communism promised them a final victory over their ancestors and all they stood for. <br /> <br />By no means was the Bolshevik Revolution a Jewish plot, but under the new anti-anti-Semitic Bolshevik regime, Jews rapidly became important military leaders, commissars, factory managers, propagandists, secret policemen, and Gulag wardens. Jews did better under the Bolsheviks than the members of any other ethnic group. This success helps explain the otherwise inexplicable loyalty of so many American Jews to Stalin's regime even through the Stalin-Hitler pact and Stalin's anti-Semitic purges after WWII. And, as Slezkine documents, their children retained their faith in radicalism, coming to dominate the student radical movements of the Sixties. <br /> <br />It all turned out badly, of course. The Soviet side of this embarrassing story has largely been shoved down the memory hole, but the ramifications of these huge events are still with us. <br /> <br />For example, after a couple of decades of haphazard anti-Semitism under the decaying post-Stalin regimes, eventually Jews in the Soviet Union came to the forefront of the anti-regime dissident movement, which helped inspire the development of neoconservatism in the U.S., especially in Sen. Henry Jackson's campaign to free Soviet Jews (spearheaded by his chief of staff Richard Perle), which is still having ramifications today in Iraq. But I can't begin to describe all the historical threads that Dr. Slezkine pulls together. When you are done reading this book, you will understand far moreabout the 20th Century.	2004-12-12

Vaca got his start as an ethnic activist by listening to Malcolm X lecture at Berkeley in 1963. <br />But by the end of the 1960s, Vaca had discovered that, in the civil rights struggle, all minorities are equal, but one minority is more equal than others:<br />&quot;Before arriving in Washington I expected to encounter other Mexican Americans at the [U.S. Commission on Civil Rights], but I discovered that I, a summer intern, was the highest ranking Mexican American there.&quot; <br />Eventually, more Latinos elbowed their way into the lucrative business of being professional minorities. But they found that the dominant blacks weren't willing to allow them places at the table in proportion to their burgeoning numbers. <br />Vaca became fascinated by how the black-Latino political conflicts that he saw all around him were swept under the rug in the media: <br />&quot;For years I discussed these issues with close friends and fellow attorneys-Anglo, Latino, and Black-as I waited for a book to appear that would address the conflict or at least go beyond pat analyses like 'Interethnic conflict can exist, but it is believed that there is more of a basis for cooperation than there is for conflict'-and then drop the subject.&quot; <br />He eventually realized he would have to write the book himself. So he has: The Presumed Alliance: The Unspoken Conflict Between Latinos and Blacks and What It Means for America.<br />Vaca recounts some fairly well-known tales: for example, how in Los Angeles in 2001, South Central blacks teamed up with San Fernando Valley white conservatives to defeat Antonio Villaraigosa's bid to become the first Mexican mayor since LA was a dusty pueblo. He also gives the once-over to the convoluted story of how Fernando Ferrer's attempt to win the 2001 Democratic mayoral primary in New York City with a Latino-black coalition foundered upon his protracted and frustrating courtship of Al Sharpton. <br />More interesting are thefresher stories-about how baldly Hispanics in Miami disdain blacks; and how dismissively the black ruling class in Compton, just outside of L.A., treats that suburb's Chicano majority.<br />As the refuge for Batista Cuba's upper and middle class, Miami has the best-organized, wealthiest (and whitest) Latino community in the U.S. In contrast, it may have the most degraded African-Americans. In both 1982 and 1989, Latin American immigrant policemen shot African-American citizens under suspicious circumstances, triggering major black riots. <br />Florida blacks with anything on the ball quickly wise up and head for Atlanta, where the white business class is a lot easier to shake down. (Vaca, however, points out that even in Georgia there are expected to be more Hispanics than blacks by 2010.) <br />As white as Miami's Cuban powerbrokers are, they feel no white guilt whatsoever. After all, they hadn't oppressed American blacks (which is certainly true-before 1959 they had been busy back home oppressing Cuban blacks). <br />Compton, the spiritual home of West Coast gangsta rap, is notorious for its corrupt and dysfunctional black-run government. Still, a lot of people south of the Border have been down so long that even Compton looks like up to them. <br />By 2001, 59% of Compton's residents, but only 15% of its voters, were Latino. Chicano activists routinely demand that Compton's black elected officials share power with its voteless illegal aliens. But the African-American leadership responds with ringing endorsements of the sanctity of citizenship that would warm the hearts of VDARE readers. <br />Of course, in the long run, the American-born children of Compton's illegal immigrants will vote their own Latino hacks into the city job sinecures (as recently happened in nearby Lynwood). In the meantime, however, Compton's black political class is getting while the getting's still good.<br />Few of Vaca's stories are edifying. In some, it's as hard to figure out who morally deserves support as it was during the Iran-Iraq war. <br />Not surprisingly, most black and brown activists wish Vaca had never written the book. (One longtime ally in the Chicano movement stomped out of the bar when Vaca described the subject of his work, and hasn't talked to him since.) And in fact it wasn't very discreet of Vaca to document for us &quot;gringos&quot; that the modern civil rights movement is just another pork-snorting contest over who can shove the most snouts into the taxpayer-subsidized trough. <br />Occasionally, though, Vaca's narrative rises above war stories about the tawdry ethnic jostling for taxpayer-supported jobs and discusses legitimate issues. Unlike the economic illiterates at the Wall Street Journal Editorial Page, who proclaim that immigrants do the jobs Americans don't want, lawyer Vaca simply takes it as one of his seven axioms that &quot;Immigrants Will Compete for Unskilled Jobs with African Americans.&quot;<br />In this dispute, Vaca's allegiance lies with his fellow co-ethnics. My loyalties, however, have to rest with my fellow American citizens. Nobody asked African-Americans if they wanted to come here. They got dragged here in chains. In contrast, immigrants chose America, presumably warts and all so it's hard to understand why they should get special privileges based on their ethnicity.	2004-06-25

A poet from Crete named Epimenides contradictorily declared &quot;I am a liar.&quot; Similarly, the very method by which Jacoby created her book gives the lie to its basic theme that assimilation is everything and selection is nothing. <br />Reinventing the Melting Pot illustrates how American intellectual discourse has become unmoored from American daily reality. The fundamental assumption of this book, as with almost everything published these days, is that social construction is all-powerful. We shouldn't worry about who or how many come to America because we can mold anybody into anything. To worry about which immigrants to let in is racist.<br />Yet, at the same time that intellectuals furiously propound the moral superiority of constructionism over selectionism, they, like most other Americans, have lost their taste for actually trying to mold individuals' characters. That's why none of the authors in the book except Harvard's George Borjas proposed anything new that we should be doing.<br />This reluctance to try to mold people is everywhere today. Look at the business world. Tom Watson Sr. had IBM employees sing 106 company songs. But that kind of social engineering of groupthink, valuable as it was in building a great company, would be inconceivable today. Now it's difficult even to get professionals to wear business suits. Instead, today's corporate ethos is selectionist: Pick the right people and then let them innovate.<br />Or, take education. Constructionism is the ideology, but selectionism is the reality. <br />Nowhere in Jacoby's book does anyone dare suggest that immigrants with high IQs might assimilate better than immigrants with low IQs. Indeed, the dread letters &quot;IQ&quot; are verboten in intellectual life these days. <br />Yet, in the real world, parents scramble to get their kids into magnet schools and gifted programs, many of which select their students explicitly on IQ. (For example, the politically correct LA Unified School District operates a Highly Gifted Magnet school specifically open only to kids with stratospheric 145+ IQs.)<br />When Americans say a neighborhood has &quot;good schools&quot; or &quot;bad schools,&quot; they mean &quot;good students&quot; or &quot;bad students.&quot; <br />Most relevantly, consider how Tamar Jacoby created Reinventing the Melting Pot. Since she admires the government's mass immigration system so much, she ought to have picked her contributors the same way the government picks immigrants. <br />For example, because most immigrants are admitted solely because they are the kin of earlier immigrants, Jacoby should have allowed other pundits to force her to hire their relatives as her authors. <br />Or, in the manner of the U.S. Government's Diversity Visa Lottery, she could have let randomly chosen opinion mongers write her book. <br />Then again, in the spirit of the new Bush Plan, she could have let any writer in the world contribute a chapter, and the book would have ended up 10,000,000 pages long and in 100 languages. <br />But, no-she carefully selected as contributors those elite individuals she considers the best and the most congenial with herself.<br />Did she then seriously attempt to assimilate the first drafts, to mold them into a coherent, persuasive whole? Not that I can tell. She didn't even try to get her contributors to agree on terminology, confessing, &quot;As an editor, I've let the essayists use their own language to describe immigrant absorption.&quot;<br />Nor does it look like she tried to keep her writers from being shown up as ignoramuses by her other writers. I'm not even talking about how Borjas makes practically everyone else look out to lunch. No, she didn't even bother to protect her neocon allies from being made to look foolish by her other neocon allies. <br />For example, Stephan Thernstrom argues that current immigrant groups will assimilate largely automatically because that's what happened to German-Americans. &quot;There was a German ethnic group once, a huge and powerful one. But it has vanished in the melting pot,&quot; he intones.<br />Yet, in the very next chapter, Nathan Glazer explains that German-American multiculturalism didn't die out naturally, but &quot;was expunged by World War I and its aftermath.&quot; <br />And later, Michael Barone gives some details of how German ethnicity was smashed in 1917: <br />&quot;The Wilson administration and its propagandists conducted a campaign against German culture, renaming sauerkraut 'liberty cabbage,' suppressing German-language schools and newspapers, prosecuting political opponents of the war.&quot;<br />You might think that Jacoby would have asked Thernstrom to assimilate these facts about German-Americans and the melting pot into a new essay that wouldn't be so laughable. <br />But, nah, Jacoby's a modern American. And modern Americans just aren't into hassling people like that. That's why we select our colleagues so carefully-to minimize friction and discordance.<br />Except, according to Jacoby and Co., this prudence and discretion would be wrong when it comes to the fundamental civic duty of choosing who gets to immigrate. <br />Immigrants ought to select themselves. And we American citizens shouldn't have any opinion on the subject. <br />Yeah, right...	2004-04-19

As a movie critic, I see lots of films featuring one of the odder bits of Hollywood hokum: the multiethnic criminal gang. <br />You know, the kind of mob that's as diverse as the cover of the University of Wisconsin recruiting brochure after the admissions office gets done Photoshopping it. <br />There's a white guy, a black guy, an Asian girl, a Sikh, a Lubavitcher, an Amish farmer, a whatever. <br />When you see a multiracial gang, you can be sure the overall movie is lame. Do you remember &quot;The Truth About Charlie&quot;, &quot;Femme Fatale&quot;, &quot;Don't say a Word&quot;,  &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and &quot;What's the Worst that Could Happen?&quot; <br />You don't? Well, neither did I until I looked them up. And, heck, I reviewed all of them within the last two years. <br />(The exception that proves the rule: &quot;Ocean's Eleven,&quot; which reveled in just how contrived is the Eleven's diversity. As Brad Pitt tells George Clooney when they discuss whom to recruit, &quot;Off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks, not to mention the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever.&quot;)<br />In contrast, the gangster movies that penetrate deepest into the human condition - like the first two &quot;Godfathers\\" - tend to emphasize the &quot;family&quot; in &quot;crime family.&quot; &quot;The Sopranos&quot; takes this concept to the limit. <br />In real life, too, ties of blood and marriage undergird most organized crime operations. And that's why multiracial gangs are much rarer in real life than in bogus movies: because, by definition, racial groups are based on extended families.<br />Why do criminals prefer, where possible, to work with close kin, or at least co-ethnics? The answer to this question is presented in the new scholarly book Risky Transactions: Trust, Kinship, and Ethnicity, edited by Frank K. Salter, an Australian political scientist now with the Max Planck Institute in Andechs, Germany. <br />Salter is doing some of the most interesting work in the human sciences right now - in fields as seemingly diverse as why ethnically-homogenous nation-states like the Scandinavian countries tend to give more welfare and how the best nightclub bouncers intimidate drunks.<br />Incentives toward ethnocentrism exist even in legitimate businesses, like the diamond trade, where lack of trust would greatly increase transaction costs. <br />For example, after I bought an engagement ring from a very low cost dealer (don't tell my wife), I had to pay an additional $100 or so to have a third-party appraiser spend twenty minutes peering at the diamond through a microscope to confirm that the gem was indeed the VS clarity - G color that the salesman had purported.<br />That's why the international wholesale diamond business is dominated by a small number of &quot;endogamous&quot; (in-marrying) ethnic groups. They can do business within the group on just a handshake. <br />Say you sell some diamonds with microscopic flaws to your third cousin in Amsterdam but charge him for flawless diamonds. When he eventually figures out you've been cheating him, he doesn't have to go through all the bother of suing you or shooting you. He just tells your mutual relatives, and soon nobody will do business with you and your children can't find spouses. So honesty is the best policy - at least toward your co-ethnics.<br />The ethnocentric incentive for business outside the law is even greater. You are in danger both from the police and your business associates. If you hand the buyer a duffel bag full of uncut drugs and he vamooses without handing you the promised suitcase full of cash, you can't threaten to take him to court. <br />So the transaction costs of doing business with people who have no reason to trust you mount rapidly. You need some thick-necked gentlemen to stand around holding submachine guns while you make the exchange; you need to murder some cheats and informers to encourage the others; and so forth. <br />In contrast, crime families, while hardly immune to betrayals, enjoy lower costs of doing business. A chapter in Risky Transactions called &quot;Mafia and Blood Symbolism&quot; by University of Amsterdam anthropologist Anton Blok provides detailed family trees showing the genealogical links uniting Sicilian and American mob families like the Gambinos, Spatolas, and di Maggios. He quotes another expert as saying:<br />&quot;These ties allowed greater flexibility and safety. In the relationships between [Sicilian] Mafioso organizers and the Italo-American gangs receiving the merchandise [heroin], where there is mutual trust over time, it is possible for one courier to arrive from America with the money while the merchandise itself is entrusted to another courier. Since no such privileged bonds existed between Sicilians and Middle Eastern suppliers, importing was a more cumbersome operation.&quot;<br />Salter points out an important concomitant to the risky transaction theory: the dividing lines between ethnic freedom fighters, gangsters, and terrorists can be awfully blurry.  This has repeatedly tripped up American thinking on foreign policy. <br />The intense kin ties that make for effective rebels, mobsters, and fanatics are most often found where government is ineffective or illegitimate or both. These are places where you need your extended family's muscle to survive, because the police are either predators or feckless. <br />Salter points out that ethnic mafias especially flourish when totalitarian regimes collapse, as in the Soviet Union and Albania. Totalitarian regimes destroyed most of the non-family associations of civil society (such as corporations, labor unions, and political parties).  The form of organization that survives is the basic biological one of kinship.	2004-03-12
US	53091994	R320GHUL4YXKWZ	0813340861	753887506	Race: The Reality of Human Differences	Books	5	259	326	N	N	Solid science and common sense	Most people who consider themselves intellectuals pride themselves on how far removed their theorizing is from contact with mundane reality. After all, if daily life could provide answers to lofty questions, we might not need so many professional intellectuals. And that subversive thought must be suppressed at all costs!<br />Consider the topic of race. The trendiest idea among intellectuals is that Race Does Not Exist. Last year, a three-night PBS documentary summed up the new orthodoxy: Race: The Power of an Illusion. That this strikes the vast majority of Americans as a self-evidently stupid notion only heightens its appeal to those who view themselves as superior because of their ability to mentally juggle esoterica.<br />Geneticist Vincent Sarich, Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Berkeley, and journalist Frank Miele, senior editor of Skeptic magazine, have stepped in to this debate with a new book Race: The Reality of Human Differences. It documents overwhelmingly that the weight of scientific knowledge is on the side of the man-in-the-street's commonsense view of race. Sarich and Miele demonstrate that all ten of the PBS documentary's summary statements on the nonexistence of race are wrong. Indeed, they bring so much firepower to bear against the series' assertions that it's a little like breaking a butterfly on a wheel. (Or, considering the mendacity of the PBS offering, a more accurate phrase might be \\"like crushing a cockroach with a cannonball.\\")<br />Rejecting the straw man argument that the existence of race would require a race for everyone and everyone in his race, Sarich and Miele call races \\"fuzzy sets.\\" They write, \\"Human races are not, and never were, distinct, mutually exclusive, Platonic entities into which every living person, unearthed skull, or set of bones could be pigeonholed.\\"<br />Miele is perhaps the best interviewer of scientists in the business. He's also a dog enthusiast, and his deep knowledge of breeds (which are artificially selected races) adds perspective to \\"Race.\\"<br />Sarich won't make himself popular with the politically correct at Berkeley, but he is a hard man to intimidate. A hawk nose and piercing eyes make him look like the world's tallest ayatollah. Approaching 70, he still has the dimensions of an NBA quick forward at 6'6\\" and a muscular 215 pounds. (In fact, he holds the world record for his age group in the small sport of indoor rowing.) Being the rare scientist who is also an enthusiastic fan of spectator sports makes Sarich far more aware of racial differences than his colleagues, who tend to only pay attention to unthreatening subjects for which they can win grants from the government or big foundations.<br /><br />In a 1989 book review in the New York Times, Richard Dawkins, author of The Selfish Gene, praised \\"the enormously important work of the American biochemist Vincent Sarich.\\" As Sarich recounts in an autobiographical section of Race, as a graduate student back in 1967, he famously teamed with Allan C. Wilson to launch the use of the \\"molecular clock,\\" which led to a revolution in evolution studies. At a time when experts on fossils believed that proto-humans had diverged from our closest ape relatives around 25 million years ago, Sarich and Wilson estimated, by counting the number of mutations that distinguished humans from chimpanzees and gorillas in a single serum protein, that our ancestors had broken away only about five million years ago. Although greeted with howls of protest from famous paleontologists, their figure has stood up well, and their molecular clock technique has become fundamental to both physical anthropology and population genetics.<br />Stephen Jay Gould insisted we chant along with him, like Dorothy trying to get home from Oz, \\"Say it five times before breakfast tomorrow: ... Human equality is a contingent fact of history.\\" As a staunch Darwinist, however, Sarich understands that natural selection requires hereditary inequalities. Sarichand Miele write, \\"Simply stated, the case for race hinges on recognition of the fact that genetic variation in traits that affect performance and ultimately survival is the fuel on which the evolutionary process runs.\\"<br />Sarich became the rare physical anthropologist expert on both genes and bones. So, when he saw PBS proclaim, \\"Despite surface differences, we are among the most similar of all species,\\" he dusted off the measurements of 2,500 human skulls from 29 different racial groups and compared them to 347 chimpanzee skulls from the two separate species of chimp (the common chimp and the bonobo). Sarich discovered that the dissimilarity in head and face measurements between these species was less than half that found between the two most morphologically dissimilar human racial groups in the sample (the narrow-faced Taita of Kenya and the wide-faced Buriat of Siberia). Sarich concludes, \\"I am not aware of any other mammalian species where the constituent races are as strongly marked as they are in ours... except those few races heavily modified by recent human selection; in particular, dogs.\\"<br />The book is packed with fascinating information. For instance, in response to PBS's claim that, \\"Race is a modern idea. Ancient societies did not divide people according to physical differences...\\" Miele writes a definitive chapter showing, \\"The art of the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Rome, India, and China, and the Islamic civilization from AD 700 to 1400 shows that these societies classified the various peoples they encountered into broad racial groups. They sorted them based upon the same set of characteristics -- skin color, hair form, and head shape -- allegedly constructed by Europeans when they invented 'race' to justify colonialism and white supremacy.\\"<br />Will Race: The Reality of Human Differences change the minds of the prominent advocates of the Race Does Not Exist theory? No, because I can't imagine they'll even read it. One striking difference between the two schools is that the realists pore over the writings of the social constructionists, while the No Race theorists prefer to keep themselves ignorant of all troubling facts.Miele write, \\"Simply stated, the case for race hinges on recognition of the fact that genetic variation in traits that affect performance and ultimately survival is the fuel on which the evolutionary process runs.\\"<br />Sarich became the rare physical anthropologist expert on both genes and bones.

The Hellpig Hunt resembles what you'd get if Hunter S. Thompson went hunting with Bluto and the rest of the gang from Animal House. Plus, Humberto tosses in philosophical asides on the predatory nature of the human male from Camille Paglia, Edward O. Wilson, and the head philosopher of hunting, Jose Ortega Y Gasset of &quot;Revolt of the Masses&quot; fame.<br />A couple of years ago I tried to explain to Humberto the appeal of golf to guys like me: &quot;You see, it's a like a suburbanized form of hunting. It's a battle against nature played out in an ideal landscape for hunting.&quot; My little dissertation appears to have been refracted back through Humberto's twisted brain on p. 138 of his tome:<br />&quot;'Then why don't more men hunt?' you ask.<br />&quot;'Lack of opportunity,' I answer. &quot;They turn to golf for the same reason men turn to sodomy in prisons.'&quot;<br />Gee, Humberto, thanks for phrasing my idea like that.	2003-12-17

Herrnstein the enormous bestseller &quot;The Bell Curve.&quot; It ignited controversy by arguing that IQ scores are one of the most overlooked tools for understanding how American society is structured.<br />Now, after a half-decade of work, Murray, a scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, is back with another massive book, 688 pages full of graphs and tables. &quot;Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800 B.C. to 1950&quot; (HarperCollins, $29.95) is a fascinating attempt to rank the 4,000 most important artists and scientists in human history.<br />Murray meticulously measured how much attention the leading scholars in their fields pay to the top creators and discoverers. Reading &quot;Human Accomplishment&quot; is a little like browsing through the statistics-laden &quot;Baseball Encyclopedia,&quot; except that instead of being about Ruth, Di Maggio, and Bonds, Murray's book is about Picasso, Darwin, and Edison.<br />Murray took some time to discuss &quot;Human Accomplishment&quot; with me.<br />Q. Who came out on top of big categories like Western Literature, Western Art, Western Philosophy, and Combined Sciences?<br />A. Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Aristotle, and Newton -- the people you'd expect.<br />In Western music, Mozart and Beethoven were in a dead heat, with Bach third. A rather vocal minority is upset about Bach not being on top. I'm not. I love Bach, but it's awfully hard to listen to Beethoven's later symphonies and string quartets and figure out how anybody could possibly be ranked above him.<br />However, let me stress: I'm not the one who made those decisions. And occasionally I had to grin and bear it when things didn't come out according to my druthers. Rousseau and Byron are way too high in Western literature for my taste, for example.<br />Q. Can you truly quantify objectively which artists and scientists were the most eminent?<br />A. Sure. It's one of the most well-developed quantitative measures in the social sciences. (The measurement of intelligence is one of its few competitors, incidentally.)<br />My indices have a statistical reliability that is phenomenal for the social sciences. There's also a very high &quot;face validity&quot; -- in other words, the rankings broadly correspond to common-sense expectations.<br />Q. Who was the most accomplished person who ever lived?<br />A. Now we're talking personal opinion, because the methods I used don't work across domains, but I have an emphatic opinion.<br />Aristotle.<br />He more or less invented logic, which was of pivotal importance in human history (and no other civilization ever came up with it independently). He wrote the essay on ethics (&quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;) that to my mind contains the bedrock truths about the nature of living a satisfying human life. He made huge contributions to aesthetics, political theory, methods of classification and scientific observation. Who else even comes close?<br />Q. Which woman scored the highest?<br />A. Murasaki Shikibu, who wrote the novel &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; a thousand years ago, has by far the highest index score -- 86 on a scale of 1 to 100. But, that is in competition just with other Japanese authors, not all of the world's authors.<br />The highest-scoring woman in any of the sciences -- no surprise -- is Marie Curie in Physics, with a score in the 40s (on a scale where Newton and Einstein are tied at 100). The highest in Western Literature is Virginia Woolf. None of the highest-scoring women in the other categories are major figures.<br />Q. You pay a surprising amount of attention to Asian culture. Does that stem from the six years you lived in Asiabeginning as a Peace Corps volunteer?<br />A. Put it this way: There are aspects of Asian culture as it is lived that I still prefer to Western culture, 30 years after I last lived in Thailand. Two of my children are half-Asian. Apart from those personal aspects, I have always thought that the Chinese and Japanese civilizations had elements that represented the apex of human accomplishment in certain domains.<br />When I began the book, I actually hoped to give Asian accomplishment a still larger place than it wound up getting.<br />Q. You argue that one big reason that most of humanity's highest achievers came from what used to be called Christendom was ... Christianity. Did you expect to reach that conclusion?<br />A. Michael Novak foretold I would come to that conclusion, but I didn't agree at the time. I didn't think you needed anything except the Greek heritage and some secular social and economic trends to explain the Renaissance.<br />On this score, I have plenty of witnesses in the form of my colleagues who were getting nervous as the years went by. They kept asking me what the thesis of the book was, and I kept saying, &quot;Beats the hell out of me.&quot;<br />The last chapters of the book were all written in the last nine months of work, and at the beginning of those nine months, I still didn't know what was going to be in them.<br />Q. You found that per capita levels of accomplishment tended to decline from 1850 to 1950. Would you care to speculate on post-1950 trends?<br />A. I think that the number of novels, songs, and paintings done since 1950 that anyone will still care about 200 years from now is somewhere in the vicinity of zero. Not exactly zero, but close. I find a good way to make this point is to ask anyone who disagrees with me to name a work that will survive -- and then ask, &quot;Seriously?&quot; Very few works indeed can defend themselves against the &quot;Seriously?&quot; question.Asia beginning as a Peace Corps volunteer?<br />A.

It briskly reviews most of the scientific evidence on male homosexuality, which shows that most of the stereotypes about gay men tend to be more or less true on average. I've studied this issue for years, and everything I've ever seen points to the validity of Bailey's conclusions about male homosexuals.<br />Bailey has outraged transexuals by publishing in the last third of the book in highly readable form the evidence that has been mounting for a number of years in scientific journals that the standardized explanation of transsexualism -- \\"I always felt like a girl on the inside, even when I was a linebacker, then a Navy SEAL, then the most feared corporate raider on Wall Street\\" -- is not very persuasive. Bailey suggests that male to female transsexuals tend to fall into one of two categories -- extremely effeminate homosexuals or masculine men who have an odd fetish called autogynephilia, which is a kind of heterosexual narcissism.<br />Is this true? Beats me. My main exposure to transsexualism is the wonderful travel writer James/Jan Morris' memoir \\"Conundrum,\\" which repeats the \\"I always felt like a girl\\" party line. It struck me at the time that Morris' descriptions of how he was a military officer, an adventurer, and fathered five children while feeling like a girl on the inside sure sounded bogus, but I hadn't heard at the time the alternative explanation of autogynephilia. Anyway, it would be easy to see why nobody would want to be associated with autogynephilia.<br />In sum, a fascinating and informative book that a well-organized pressure groupdoesn't want you to read. What better reason to read it?	2003-08-16

Not being in on the cult, let me say that Farber had pretty good taste in movies, liking hard-boiled masculine shoot-em-ups in the Forties. And he is, apparently, a very good painter, still having one man shows today in his late eighties. Still, he was a hideously disorganized writer. Reviews seem to start and end at random points in his chain of thoughts. There are some good phrases, but I'd be hard pressed to recount many coherent ideas from his book. It's not that he's lacking good ideas -- in fact, he has too many. He's just not very good at putting them into a comprehensible form. If you are a fanatic for either forties tough guy directors or late sixties artsy directors, you'll no doubt benefit from grinding through the book, but for the general reader, it's a struggle. <br />I'm hardly surprised that he gave up reviewing over 25 years ago for painting. Writing just doesn't seem to be his strong suit.	2003-07-08

Sadly, he died just as it was time to go do a book tour in promotion of Collision Course, so the book got little publicity. As an expert on Congress and the workings of the federal bureaucracy, he is able to recreate just how we managed to stumble unintentionally into the current, highly contradictory, immigration and affirmative action systems. At a time when the nation was finally intending to help African-Americans, why did it suddenly import tens of millions of low wage workers to drive blacks from many workplaces? And if affirmative action was intended as compensation for slavery and Jim Crow, why was it extended to new immigrants, even illegal ones? And what does this portend for the future, when the &quot;racial ratio&quot; of beneficiaries from quotas compared to those who must shoulder the burden mounts ever higher?	2003-07-08

In other words, they trace the genealogies of racial groups. It's an inherently fascinating subject, and science journalist Steve Olson introduces it adequately in his new book, Mapping Human History. Written in the breezy style of a National Geographic travel-log, Olson's book is a quick read, but a little too superficial to be intellectually satisfying. Still, it's not a bad overview of an important subject.<br />It would be better, though, without the recurrent political sermonizing. Unfortunately for population geneticists, their subject matter-race-is vastly unfashionable. So, the dean of the field, Stanford's great L.L. Cavalli-Sforza long ago developed the transparent subterfuge of defining the word \\"race\\" in the most ludicrous straw-man terms possible-as the classification of the human race into absolutely separate, never-overlapping, mutually exclusive categories. (Never specified is exactly who today believes such a thing: the Grand Kleagle's retarded brother, perhaps?) This straw-man definition allows him to deny that he's studying race, since by his definition \\"race\\" is impossible.  Still, it allows Cavalli-Sforza to get back to work without being crucified for political incorrectness, so we shouldn't hold it against him.<br />Unfortunately, Olson never seems to grasp that this is just pro forma boilerplate. In his book, Olson stops every few pages to tell you that there are no races that have been absolutely isolated genetically since the beginning of time because-you will be shocked, shocked to learn this-humans have been known to outbreed. (The reality of course is that for any human racial group, the inbreeding glass is both part empty and part full.) This makes Mapping Human History rather like a geology book that repeatedly admonishes the reader that the Earth is not flat.<br />Another curious feature that Olson'sbook shares with many other contemporary writings about population genetics is the author's apparent longing for the abolition of his own subject matter via universal random interbreeding. Although animal and plant biodiversity is routinely celebrated as a supreme good, the conclusions of books on human biodiversity tend to treat it as a temporary evil that will soon be gone, and good riddance to it. It's as if that geology textbook ended with an ode to the blessed day when the Earth will plunge into the Sun, thus happily eliminating the need for a science of geology.<br />In his final chapter, \\"The End of Race,\\" Olson cites Hawaii as exemplifying the future of the human race. Still, not even Hawaii has achieved racial nirvana. Despite interracial marriage blurring the ethnic boundaries, the Native Hawaiians are now campaigning hard to have themselves declared a sovereign nation like American Indian tribes. <br />On a vaster scale, Brazil exhibits the same tendency for class to correlate with color, and for the people at the bottom of the pile to agitate, not unreasonably, for race-based privileges for themselves. Currently, the government of Brazil is introducing racial quotas in response to black demands.<br />Further, the mixing of races often leads to new races rather than to no races, such as the Angles and Saxons became the Anglo-Saxons.<BR> <BR>This notion that the entire world will soon consist of one beige race is both highly popular and highly dubious. I see little statistical evidence to suggest that there will be significantly greater racial admixture in either Asia or Africa anytime in the 21st Century ... and that's where most humans will live. <br />For example, the UN's best guess is that China will have 1,462 million people in 2050. The Chinese government shows no intention of ever admitting many immigrants, so the racial admixture level in China will not change perceptibly. The UN also projects that in 2050, India will have a population of 1,572 million. Almost all of these people will be racially descended from current Indians. Why? Well, who would want to move to India? It's a country that's more than full now, even before it adds another half billion Indians. <br />Other populous countries that-trust me-won't be attracting huge numbers of immigrants from other continents include Pakistan (344 million in 2050), Indonesia (311 million), Nigeria (279 million), Bangladesh (265 million), the Congo (204 million), and Yemen and Uganda (102 million each). In other words, the absolute numbers of racially distinct East Asians, blacks, and non-European Caucasians will be larger in 2050 than today.<br />Most of the growth in racial mixing will be restricted to regions where intermarriage has been a long tradition (primarily Latin America and some remote islands) or are immigrant magnets (presumably North America, Australia, and Western Europe). <br />In essence, what is so enthusiastically anticipated is the admixture of people of European descent. Evidently, there is something uniquely, even superhumanly potent and evil about European DNA that means it must be diluted. Strikingly, the greatest enthusiasts for this view tend to be highly European themselves. (Olson, for example, is blonde.) This reflects that weird combination of racial self-loathing and racial egotism found in so many white intellectuals. <br />Finally, I doubt that the beigeification of Europeans will proceed all that quickly. I don't think it's at all inevitable that Eastern Europe will open its borders to non-Europeans. Prudent statesmen in the ex-Communist countries will be wary of reproducing Western Europe's travails with hostile immigrant minorities, although the European Union will no doubt try to bully them into it.<br />So, the odds are that-on a global scale-the current races will remain at the end of this century almost as distinct as they are today. Then, beyond 2100, DNA engineering and, perhaps, interstellar colonization will likely radically increase genetic differences among humans.<br />So, while a better book than this one could certainly be written about race, you can feel confident that if you do invest the modest amount of time required to read Olson's effort, you don't have to worry that its subject matter will suddenly evaporate.	2002-06-29

He knows an elaborate amount about the 19th century German philosophers like the excruciatingly boring Hegel. Nonetheless, since his college days he has self-educated himself to a nearly heroic extent about the real world. Unfortunately in this book, he tries to combine Hegel and reality, with uneven results. He has largely dropped German philosophy in his subsequent and more readable books.<br />His general thesis is reasonable but limited: the war over ideology is over, capitalism and democracy have won. However, ideological conflict has only comprised a tiny fraction of history. Most of history consists of what Lenin himself called &quot;Who, whom?&quot; Who will do it to whom? The conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians is a classic example. A related problem is that history isn't over because while most people may approve of capitalist and democrat states, many are not satisfied with the borders of existing states. Finally, it's not clear that much of the world (e.g., Africa) has what it takes to be successfully capitalist and democratic.

The book's content is irresistible - at its heart is a table of the average IQ scores of 81 different countries, drawn from studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The national average IQs range from 107 for Hong Kong to 59 for Equatorial Guinea. <br />Lynn and Vanhanen benchmarked their IQ results so that Britain is 100. America scores 98 on this scale, and the world average is 90. IQ's are assumed to form a normal probability distribution (\\"bell curve\\") with the standard deviation set at 15. Here are a few examples:<br />                        <BR>  Nation Avg.       IQ <BR>Eq. Guinea        59    <BR>Nigeria           67     <BR>Barbados          78   <BR>Guatemala         79   <BR>India             81   <BR>Iraq              87   <BR>Mexico            87   <BR>Argentina         96   <BR>US                98   <BR>China            100   <BR>UK               100   <BR>Italy            102   <BR>Japan            105    <BR>Hong Kong        107    <br />Admit it, you want to know what the rest of the table says! Beyond satisfying sheer curiosity, though, the strong correlation between IQ and the wealth of nations is of world-historical importance. From now on, no public intellectual can seriously claim to be attempting to understand how the world works unless he takes IQ into account.<br />How much can we trust these IQ results? <br />As soon as I received the book, I turned to Appendix 1, where Lynn and Vanhanen describe all 168 national IQ studies they've found - an average of just over two per country. <br />Are the results internally consistent? In other words, when there are multiple studies for a single country, do they tend to give roughly the same answer?<br />I expected a sizable amount of internal divergence. I spent 18 years in the marketing research industry, so I know how expensive it is to come up with a nationally representative sample. Further, Lynn and Vanhanen use results from quite different IQ tests. They rely most on the non-verbal Raven's Progressive Matrices, which were designed to be used across cultures, even by illiterates. Yet, they also have a lot of results from the Wechsler exams, which are more culture dependent - the Wechsler include a vocabulary subtest, for example. And they report results from other IQ tests, including a few from the oddball Goodenough-Harris Draw-A-Man test. Also, sample sizes vary dramatically, from a few dozen in some obscure countries to 64,000 for one American study. Finally, some studies were of children, others of adults.<br />This doesn't sound promising. Nevertheless, the results show a high degree of internal consistency. Here are the first eight countries for which they have multiple scores:<br />Argentina: 93 and 98<BR>Australia: 97, 98, and 99<BR>Austria: 101, 103<BR>Belgium: 99, 103, 98<BR>Brazil: 88, 84, 90, and 85<BR>Bulgaria: 94, 91<BR>China: 100, 92.5, 103.4<BR>Democratic Republic of Congo: 73, 72<br />That's not bad at all. In fact, leaving aside China, the results are remarkably consistent. There are, of course, a few countries for which different studies came up with quite divergent results, especially Poland, where the two scores Lynn and Vanhanen found were 92 and 106. Still, the correlation among results when there are two or more studies for a country is a striking 0.94.<br />You shouldn't take every score on faith. The reported IQ for Israel (only 94????!!!) has elicited much criticism. Lynn has replied that he wanted to publish the data as he found it, even if some of it looked implausible. His hope is to encourage further research to resolve seeming anomalies.<br />The IQ structures of the two giga-countries, China and India, demand more intense study, in part because the future history of the world will hinge in no small part on their endowments of human capital. The demography of India is especially complex due to its caste system, which resembles Jim Crow on steroids and acid. By discouraging intermarriage, caste has subdividedthe Indian people into an incredible number of micro-races. In India, according to the dean of population genetics, L.L. Cavalli-Sforza, \\"The total number of endogamous communities today is around 43,000...\\" We know that some of those communities - such as the Zoroastrian Parsees of Bombay - are exceptionally intelligent.<br />But we can't say with any confidence what is the long run IQ potential of Indians overall. Their current IQ score (81) is low, especially compared to China (100), the other country with hundreds of millions of poor peasants. Yet, keep in mind just how narrow life in rural India was for so long. In 1952, on the fifth anniversary of independence, the Indian government commissioned a survey to find out if the average Indian villager had heard yet that the British had gone. The study was quietly cancelled when early results showed that the average villager had never heard that the British had ever arrived!<br />It appears likely that some combination of malnutrition, disease, inbreeding, lack of education, lack of mental stimulation, lack of familiarity with abstract reasoning and so forth can keep people from reaching their genetic potential for IQ. Lynn himself did early studies demonstrating that malnutrition drives down IQ. The co-authors conclude their book by recommending that <br />\\"The rich countries' economic aid programs for the poor countries should be continued and some of these should be directed at attempting to increase the intelligence levels of the populations of the poorer countries by improvements in nutrition and the like.\\"<br />A clear example of how a bad environment can hurt IQ can be seen in the IQ scores for sub-Saharan African countries. They average only around 70. In contrast, African-Americans average about 85. It appears unlikely that African-Americans' white admixture can account for most of this 15-point gap because they are only around 17%-18% white on average, according to the latest genetic research. (Thus African-Americans white genes probably couldn't account for more than 3 points of the gap between African-Americans and African-Africans.) This suggests that the harshness of life in Africa might be cutting ten points or more off African IQ scores. <br />Similarly, West Africans are significantly shorter in height than their distant cousins in America, most likely due to malnutrition and infections. The two African-born NBA superstars, Hakeem Olajuwon and Dikembe Mutombo, are both from the wa-benzi [people of the (Mercedes ) Benz]upper class. Only the elite in Africa gets enough food and health care to grow up to be NBA centers.<br />This also implies that African-Americans might be able to achieve higher IQs too, although the environmental gap between white Americans and black Americans appears to be much smaller than between black Americans and black Africans. As I pointed out in VDARE in 2000, the most promising avenue for improving African-Americans' IQs is by promoting breastfeeding among blacks mothers, who nurse their babies at much lower rates than whites.<br />In fact, we know that IQ is not completely fixed over time because raw test scores have been rising for decades, about 2 to 3 points per decade. To counteract this, the IQ test-making firms periodically make it harder - in absolute terms - to achieve a score of 100. Lynn was possibly the first scientist to make this phenomenon widely known, although New Zealand political scientist James Flynn has gotten more credit for this recently. And, indeed, Lynn and Vanhanen scrupulously adjust the test results in their book to account for when each test was taken.	2002-04-22

As this book shows, he's a fine popular science writer. He also has a sizable ego and a flair for self-dramatization that annoys other scientists but appeals to the public. He often tends to portray himself in The Seven Daughters as a Galileo single-handedly doing battle with the benighted masses of anthropologists and geneticists like Stanford's distinguished L.L. Cavalli-Sforza, who, according to Sykes' not exactly neutral account, just didn't want to admit the importance of his mitochondrial DNA research. <br />Most importantly, though, Sykes has grasped a simple fact about population genetics that resounds emotionally with the average person, yet has largely eluded most learned commentators. Namely, genes are the stuff of genealogy. Each individual's genes are descended from some people, but not from some other people. Thus, Sykes discovered, people often feel a sense of family pride and loyalty to others, living and dead, with whom they share some DNA. <br />Further, if you read between his lines, you can readily understand why - despite all the propaganda that \\"race does not exist\\" - humanity will never get over its obsession with race: Race is Family. A racial group is an extremely extended family that is inbred to some degree. <br />In fact, people are so interested in tracing their family connections that Sykes has gone into business for himself. He started a for-profit firm OxfordAncestors.com. \\"Discover your ancestral mother,\\" he advertises. For [money] he'll trace your DNA (actually, a particular set of your specialized mitochondrial DNA) back to one of the seven Stone Age women who arethe ancestors in the all-female line of 95% of all white Europeans. <br />Sykes calls these \\"the Seven Daughters of Eve.\\" (He's piggybacking on the much-publicized concept of the primordial \\"Mitochondrial Eve\\" from whom all women are supposedly descended.) One of his sales slogans: \\"Which daughter was your ancestor?\\" <br />(If you happen to be from a non-European race, well, Sykes has got 27 other matrilineal clans sketchily worked out for you. Still, the Eurocentric, cashocentric Sykes tends to treat those non-Caucasian ancient mothers as if they were The Twenty-Seven Stepdaughters of Eve.) <br />Some scientists are appalled by Sykes' shameless entrepreneurialism. Myself, I think that the self-effacing saints like the late William D. Hamilton (the greatest theoretical biologist of the 20th Century and the genius behind more famous biologists like Edward O. Wilson and Richard Dawkins) and the attention-seekers like Sykes both serve useful purposes in advancing science. <br />The key to Sykes' business is that within a particular set of stable \\"junk DNA\\" in the mitochondrial code, mutations happen every 10,000 years on average. Last spring, in \\"Darwinophobia I,\\" I explained why junk genes are so useful to geneticists studying individual or racial genealogies, yet so useless to the bodies they inhabit since they don't do anything. But these genes' uselessness means they aren't subject to Darwinian selection. So they are passed on unchanged, except by random mutations. <br />Of course, precisely because population geneticists like Sykes and Cavalli-Sforza study only useless genes that don't do anything, they don't have anything credible to say about useful genes, like the ones that influence IQ. To learn about nonjunk genes, you need to read behavior geneticists like twin expert Nancy Segal or intelligence gene finder Robert Plomin. <br />Without going into the technical details, a study of mitochondrial DNA allows you to track the line of purely female descent in your genealogy. This is the opposite of the \\"paternal line of descent\\" by which your surname came down to you. (The male line can be tracked through tests of the Y chromosome.) The maternal line is your mother's mother's mother's etc. - all female, all the way back. <br />You can visualize your maternal line this way. Mentally lay out your family tree, with you at the bottom. Place your father above you to the left and your mother above you to the right. Fill in all your grandparents, great-grandparents, and so forth, always keeping the males to the left in each pair. Then, the matrilineal line of descent is the extreme right edge of your family tree (just as your last name comes from the extreme left edge). <br />Sykes has put together a chart of these functionally trivial but genealogically interesting mutations that allow him to state, for example, that the woman who claimed to be Anastasia Romanov (who was portrayed by Ingrid Bergman in her Oscar-winning performance in Anastasia) could not have been the daughter of the Czarina murdered by Lenin. <br />(Of course, considering how many surviving members of the Romanov extended family she fooled into thinking she was Anastasia, the possibility remains that she might still have been some kind of biological relative of the Romanovs. Perhaps she was fathered illegitimately by a member of the Czar's side of the family. Neither Sykes' matrilineal test, nor a Y chromosome patrilineal test can rule that out.) <br />Sykes has identified seven mitochondrial mutations of particular genealogical importance. Logically, for each mutation there existed an individual woman. <br />Who were these seven women? They weren't the only women alive at the time. They probably weren't even the first ones to be born with their distinctive mutant junk gene. Each of the seven daughters is simply the first after the appearance of their mutation to have a daughter who had a daughter who had a daughter and on and on in an unbroken line of female descent down to the present day. They are special only in the rather arbitrary genealogical sense of each being on the extreme right edge of the family tree of tens of millions of modern Europeans.	2002-04-22

It ends with a detailed description of how 21st Century American air power pulverizes a Chinese armored invasion of Siberia. I finished it and said, &quot;Okay, we're obviously going to crush the Taliban from the air. No problemo. (My biggest worry then became that the Taliban would hand over Osama to us before we could devastate them, which we had to do in order to encourage the other regimes to not allow anti-American terrorists to operate from their territories.) I was incredulous when so many pundits decided around Nov. 1st that the Taliban were winning. &quot;Don't they know anything about our current air power? Don't they read Tom Clancy novels?&quot; A week later, of course, the fearsome Taliban threw down their weapons and ran into the hills, screaming like little girls.

Freeman &amp; Co., 340 pp., $23.95) celebrates the lives of two dozen great statisticians.<br /> Short biographies of statistical innovators -- such as Francis Galton, Karl Pearson, Edward Deming, John Tukey and the most important of all, Ronald A. Fisher -- might seem of limited interest. Yet, over the past century, statisticians probably have done more to help us understand the real world than philosophers, who are endlessly profiled in countless books.<br /> When discussing what has helped him in his work, Nobel Laureate physicist Stephen Weinberg has undiplomatically referred to &quot;the unexpected uselessness of philosophy,&quot; while praising the &quot;unexpected usefulness of mathematics.&quot;<br /> The fecklessness of philosophy stems in part from the anti-statistical bias of the central tradition in European philosophy. Going back to Plato, philosophers have tended to assume that reality is based on abstract essences that could be described by geometry or words. In truth, though, the natural and human worlds appear to be probabilistic affairs. Statistics have thus proven crucial for describing subjects as commonplace as differences in human intelligence, as esoteric as quantum mechanics, and as life-or-death as the testing of new medicines.<br /> This ignorance of statistics also plagues our public life. Veteran pundit James J. Kilpatrick has rightly argued that young journalists absolutely ought to study statistics in college. For instance, the press is constantly fouling up stories on topics as important as health or race because reporters don't understand that when a scientist says that &quot;A correlates with B,&quot; he does not necessarily mean &quot;A causes B.&quot; The other three possibilities are: 1. &quot;B causes A.&quot; 2. &quot;Something else causes both A and B.&quot; Or, 3. &quot;A and B aren't actually related, they just looked that way because of random luck or a mistake in our study.&quot;<br /> The founder of modern nursing, Florence Nightingale, said, &quot;To understand God's thoughts, we must study statistics, for these are the measure of His purpose.&quot; As the inventor of the pie chart, which she used to show that bad medical care was killing more British soldiers than enemy bullets, she makes a brief appearance in Salsburg's engaging &quot;The Lady Tasting Tea.&quot;<br /> The whimsical title refers to a Cambridge University tea party at which a lady insisted, &quot;Tea tasted different depending upon whether the tea was poured into the milk or whether the milk was poured into the tea.&quot; Most of the scientists attending thought this nonsense, but the great R.A. Fisher immediately devised a careful experiment that was largely capable of ruling out the effect of random luck. In Fisher's experiment, the lady correctly identified each cup.<br /> Fisher published two crucial books in 1925 and 1935 that showed scientists for the first time how to design experiments that would produce statistically valid results.<br /> To avoid scaring off readers, Salsburg left out all mathematical formulas, but that's a little like a history of art without pictures. Still, for anyone somewhat familiar with the main statistical techniques, this is a pleasant introduction to the men and women behind them.<br /> Of course, statisticians generally try not to lead lives of lurid drama.<br /> Yet, quite a few were persecuted by Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin.<br /> For example, a brilliant agricultural statistician named Chester Bliss couldn't find a job in America during the Depression, so Fisher landed him a post at the Leningrad Plant Institute. One day, his Russian girlfriend told him that the Communist Party had decided he was an American spy.<br /> As his inquisition began, Bliss immediately went on the offensive, denouncing the communist experts for bad statistical techniques. Healso called communism &quot;the gospel according to Saint Mark and Saint Lenin.&quot; Astonished, Stalin's minions decided he was too honest to be a spy. So, the communists left him alone for months until they eventually realized that while he wasn't a spy, he was an anti-communist. He had to flee for his life.<br /> The Stalinists were even more offended by the discipline of statistics than were the Nazis and Fascists. Salsburg describes why in a passage of black comedy:<br /> &quot;The mathematical concept of a 'random variable' lies at the heart of statistical methods. The Russian translation for 'random variable' is 'accidental magnitude.' To the central planners and theoreticians, this was an insult. All industrial and social activity in the Soviet Union was planned according to the theories of Marx and Lenin. Nothing could occur by accident. ... The applications of mathematical statistics were quickly stifled.&quot;<br /> Salsburg makes clear that the early statisticians were largely interested in developing techniques for studying the inheritance of intelligence, an inquiry that continues to attract furious denunciations even today.<br /> Francis Galton -- who invented fingerprinting, the weather map, and the silent dog whistle -- was the smarter half-cousin of Charles Darwin. Their common grandparent was the near-genius Erasmus Darwin, who had proposed his own version of a theory of evolution. Not surprisingly, Galton was fascinated by how intelligence tends to run in families. In 1869, Galton wrote the first book on the subject, &quot;Hereditary Genius.&quot;<br /> To aid his research, he invented the correlation coefficient and the concept of &quot;regression to the mean,&quot; which explained why smart parents tend to have less smart children. Galton invented the term &quot;eugenics&quot; to describe the now highly unfashionable field of studying how to improve the human genetic stock. He suggested encouraging the finest young men and women to marry.<br /> Fisher, in fact, was such an enthusiast for eugenics that during World War II he was falsely accused of being a fascist and blocked from helping with Britain's war effort. Fisher's belief in the value of eugenics led him to become perhaps the leading mathematical geneticist of his generation.<br /> Advances in the Human Genome Project, genetic engineering, and sperm and egg selection are now beginning to make it feasible for couples to choose some of their child's genes. So, the controversies over eugenics are beginning all over again. But pro or con, anyone attempting to understand the coming impact of the new genetic technologies will need to use the statistical techniques invented by Galton and Fisher. -- Steve Sailer	2001-07-17

It has been studied extensively in controlled experiments. In Race in the Making, the liberal U. of Michigan anthropology professor Lawrence A. Hirschfeld sums up the findings: &quot;As comforting as this view may be, children, I will show in this book, are more than aware of diversity; they are driven by endogenous curiosity to uncover it. Children, I will also show, do not believe race to be a superficial quality of the world. Multicultural curricula aside, few people believe that race is only skin deep. Certainly few 3-year-olds do. They believe that race is an intrinsic, immutable, and essential aspect of a person's identity. Moreover, they seem to come to this conclusion on their own. They do not need to be taught that race is a deep property, they know it themselves already.&quot;<br />For example, if you show preschoolers drawings of people and ask them to match the children with their parents, they will consistently tell you that the skinny white child is the child of the fat white parent, while the fat black child belongs to the skinny black parent (or vice-versa). <br />It seems obvious to me why little kids pay close attention to race. It's crucial for them to understand who is related to whom, and racial traits provide a more reliable guide than even body shape. (In technical terms, racial traits tend to be have higher narrow heritability coefficient than other traits like body shape.) The reason racial traits tend to be highly heritable and thus highly useful in multiracial situations for identifying family members is because race is family: a racial group is merely an extremely extended family that inbreeds to some degree.<br />Unfortunately, Hirschfeld gets himself tangled up in his own underwear trying to explain his findings. Being a good modern liberal, he believes that Race Does Not Exist. He never really gets himself untangled on this subject.He seemscompletely unaware of the fact that racial groups are just big extended families. In contrast, Occam's razor suggests that the reason we pay attention to racial resemblances is the same reason we pay attention to family resemblances. <br />Steve Sailer	2001-06-09

Multicultural Conservatism in America	Books	3	11	18	N	N	Reasonably respectful, but unarmed for intellectual combat	ANGELA DILLARD, a young black political historian of leftist views, has written a well-intentioned book about &quot;multicultural conservative&quot; intellectuals, whom she defines as blacks (such as Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele, and Clarence Thomas), Hispanics (e.g., Linda Chavez), gays (e.g., Andrew Sullivan), and women (e.g., Midge Decter and Gertrude Himmelfarb). Theoretically, lesbian conservatives would also qualify, but Dillard can find only two. Although she quotes a number of Asian conservatives, such as education reformer Arthur Hu, she can't make up her mind whether Asians are multicultural enough to count. <br />Obviously, there's not much conceptual coherence to her grouping. The euphemism &quot;multicultural&quot; is popular because it obfuscates the fact that most identity-politics categories are fundamentally biological. Blacks, for example, are a racial group defined by their possessing some degree of African ancestry. They are not a culture, per se. The notion that blacks are permanently stuck with a culture clearly separate from white America's (either because of white racism or genetic difference) is precisely what many black conservatives oppose. They envision an America that is multiracial but essentially monocultural. <br />Similarly, women belong to a sex, not a culture. If female conservatives were actually defined by a shared culture, then Decter and Himmelfarb could have passed it on to their sons John Podhoretz and William Kristol; but what they passed on was conservatism, not &quot;female conservatism.&quot; And whatever it is that causes male homosexuality also seems to incline gay men away from anti-elitist multiculturalism and toward conserving the high culture of Dead White European Males. Just imagine how moribund ballet, sculpture, painting, opera, and the Broadway musical would be today without gay men. Nevertheless, the steady growth in the number of conservative pundits who are not straight white guys is an important topic. <br/>The fact that Dillard treats her conservative subjects with a certain amount of respect makes her nearly unique among leftists. Dillard deserves praise for overcoming her original prejudice that black conservatives must be &quot;traitors, sellouts, and self-loathing lackeys.&quot; Within the claustrophobic limits imposed by her liberal perspective, she is surprisingly fair. For instance, she points out that although the first major black woman novelist, Zora Neale Hurston, is jealously worshiped by leftist feminists, she was in fact a staunch conservative. She also admits that the conservative establishment's warm reception of black intellectuals reflects a change in attitudes on race that her fellow leftists would prefer to ignore. <br />Sadly, however, Dillard is ill-equipped to offer much meaningful or substantive analysis of the arguments of minority conservatives. She is interested only in analyzing these thinkers' rhetorical positioning, especially the relationship between their autobiographies and the stands they took. Dillard lives in the postmodern dreamland that hovers disconnected from reality like Gulliver's Laputa, the floating island of intellectuals. Her disdain for facts is palpable. For example, she repeatedly labels as &quot;stereotypes&quot; all references to blacks' suffering from high rates of illegitimacy and murder. It never seems to occur to her that they describe actual live babies and dead bodies. She also accuses &quot;multicultural conservatives&quot; of trying &quot;to assimilate on the backs of the black poor.&quot; In reality, black conservatives since Booker T Washington have traditionally focused more on uplifting the black poor, while black liberals have worked harder to help the black elite that W. E. B. DuBois dubbed the &quot;Talented Tenth.&quot; The NAACP, for instance, cares more about restoring quotas at UC-Berkeley than doing anything that would actually help inner-city schools. <br />The value of nonwhite pundits to the conservative movement is reflected in an old joke that the humorless Dillard fails to include: <br />&quot;Q. What do you call a black man at a Heritage Foundation conference?&quot; <br />&quot;A. Keynote speaker.&quot; <br />Okay, it's not too hilarious, but it does point out three facts about nonwhite conservative intellectuals. First, the best are highly impressive figures. Second, the very existence of nonwhite conservative spokesmen is hugely reassuring to white conservatives terrified of being called &quot;racist.&quot; Third, as George W Bush's dismal performance among minority voters last November demonstrated, the problem is not that there are too few minority conservative thinkers but that there are too few such voters. Conservatives should therefore take heed of Dillard's forecast that all this minority intellectual support won't translate into many minority votes. <br />Dillard's political predictions are much more interesting than her policy analysis. Writing before the 2000 election, she argued that conservatism has &quot;little likelihood of a deep and lasting success&quot; among nonwhite voters. The election results did nothing to disprove that thesis. Despite his outreach efforts, George W. Bush still ended up earning just 35 percent of the Hispanic vote and 9 percent of the black vote. (In Bush's home state of Texas, he carried more than 70 percent of the white vote, but a mere 5 percent of black voters.) He did a bit better among Asians, but even there he was trounced 54-41. Blacks and Asians actually gave a larger share of their votes to the hapless Bob Dole in 1996. Even for those who hold a more optimistic view of conservatism's prospects among &quot;multicultural&quot; voters, numbers like that should give pause.<br />Steve Sailer is a columnist for VDARE and an adjunct fellow of the Hudson Institute.	2001-06-08

Men of West African descent (e.g., African Americans) are more likely to have the explosive combination of strength, quickness, and sprinting speed needed to make it to the NBA and the NFL than other races (although Samoans aren't far behind at all in having the bodies most in demand in football). Certain East African tribes, especially the Kalenjin of Kenya, are tremendously better than the world average at distance running. On the other hand, whites tend to be better than blacks at some sports requiring higher body fat percentages, such as English Channel swimming and dog sled mushing. <br />Despite (or because of) the overwhelming evidence for Entine's thesis, this book drives some people crazy. 1. Many white guys absolutely hate reading that blacks tend to be better than whites at some very important sports. 2. Many argue that, although everybody talks about racial differences, it should never ever be written about. The end result of that kind of censorship, of course, is that all that most people hear on the subject is a lot of barroom blather rather than the sophisticated, informed, and nuanced perspective that a top writer like Entine can bring to the subject.<br />Steve Sailer	2001-05-10

So argues evolutionary biologist Paul Ewald in his new book, &quot;Plague Time: How Stealth Infections Cause Cancers, Heart Disease, and Other Deadly Ailments,&quot; (Free Press, 282 pp, ...).<br /> The Amherst professor is trying to drag the medical establishment into the Darwinian age. While modern research often aims to uncover genetic factors in major diseases, Ewald contends that &quot;human genome mania&quot; often violates the fundamental principle of biology, Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin argued that families with harmful hereditary traits will die out over time, asserts Ewald, and would be replaced by lineages whose hereditary constitution better enables them to survive and reproduce.<br /> Ultimate goals aside, Ewald has made sure that lay readers will find his book interesting and intelligible. He believes that patients are often more open-minded than their doctors.<br /> In an interview, Ewald claimed that the health benefits of the Human Genome Project are over hyped because &quot;most diseases aren't genetic.&quot; He said research funds dedicated to improve antibiotics would bring greater payoffs than those spent on the glamour field of genetic research.<br /> Ewald, who is not a medical doctor, said, &quot;My goal is to bring into medicine all of biology, especially evolution.&quot;<br /> So far, he has had more success persuading other biologists than the medical establishment. The late William D. Hamilton of Oxford University, England -- considered by the likes of Edward O. Wilson and Richard Dawkins to be the most important evolutionary thinker of recent decades -- commented on Ewald's theory, &quot;It opens our eyes to many quite weird possibilities about disease that most medical scientists, tending to be unaware of current evolutionary thought, don't think of.&quot;<br /> Ewald contends there are only three fundamental causes of disease:<br /> -- First, nonliving environmental agents like radiation, poisons, and nutrition. Too many cigarettes cause lung cancer; too little Vitamin D causes rickets.<br /> -- Second, infections. Long ago, people figured out that smallpox, measles, and chicken pox passed from one person to another. Since then, an ever-growing number of diseases have been shown to be induced by bacteria, viruses, or protozoa.<br /> Historically, infectious agents have been harder to identify than nonliving poisons as the cause of diseases because germs can evolve ways to hide. Simple chemicals cannot.<br /> -- Third, hereditary causes. The Human Genome Project has been widely advertised as eventually leading to cures for many diseases, such as breast cancer. Ewald observed, however, &quot;If one identical twin gets breast cancer, the other's likelihood of contracting it is only around 10 to 20 percent. This suggests that genes are not the whole story.&quot;<br /> But the more basic logical problem with what he dubs Human Genome Mania, argued Ewald, is natural selection theory.<br /> Such reasoning was forcefully introduced to Ewald in the early 1990s by a letter from a physicist named Gregory Cochran. After America won the Cold War, this New Mexico rocket scientist had turned to developing formulas for estimating which diseases are hereditary and which are infectious. The key number proved to be the ailment's &quot;reproductive fitness burden.&quot; In other words: Compared to a healthy person, how many fewer descendents will a sufferer procreate?<br /> The tendency of people with healthy genes to reproduce more than people with sick genes, Cochran and Ewald determined, makes it unlikely that there are many hereditary syndromes that are both widespread and significantly damaging to their victims ability to reproduce successfully.<br /> We can evolve new defenses against both bad genes and bad germs. What makes infections more dangerous than genes, however, is that germs can fight back, said Ewald. They can relatively quickly counter our new resistance strategies by evolving news methods of attack -- thus antibiotic resistence, for example.<br /> Ewald admits there are numerous hereditary diseases. But the ones produced by spontaneous mutations tend to be quite rare since the bad genes quickly get weeded out of the gene pool, he said, citing Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. This male-inherited disorder of progressive muscular degeneration may be the most widespread example, yet it only afflicts 0.02 percent of the populace, said Ewald.<br /> Still, it's possible for more common hereditary diseases to survive down through the generations if they are a defense against something worse. The best known example is sickle cell anemia, a blood disorder that sickens and can kill those of West African descent who inherit two copies of the sickle cell gene. Those who receive only one copy from their parents, however, have greater resistance to a debilitating form of malaria.<br /> A spokesman for the National Human Genome Research Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, responded diplomatically to Ewald's charges that research dollars invested in genetic research would save more lives if devoted to infectious diseases instead. He suggested, &quot;This shouldn't be a zero sum fight. As promising new areas come along, the government should spend more on health research in general.&quot;<br /> The Bethesda, Md.-based spokesman also argued that when the Human Genome Project eventually maps the variations found among a large number of individuals, it will help us understand why some people have better resistance to particular germs. For example, he said, certain East African prostitutes appear to be immune to HIV. Understanding their genetic peculiarities might well help researchers uncover the Achilles heel of AIDS.<br /> Nonetheless, Ewald's &quot;Plague Time&quot; may someday be remembered as a landmark in the development of more effective treatments for killer diseases.	2001-02-20

This updating of Darwin's &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot;  is tons of fun to read, and seems to authoritatively answer a lot of the  questions about why art exists that Steven Pinker's &quot;How the Mind  Works&quot; tended to gloss over. (Short answer: cuz chicks dig  it).<br />However, anyone familiar with Darwin's book will note that Miller  prudently left out one of the &quot;The Descent of Man's&quot; major  themes: how sexual selection leads to differences among the races. As a  young man starting out, Miller can be forgiven for not touching that huge  taboo, but as his reputation solidifies, we can only hope that he returns  to the crucial question of human biodiversity. <br />I also look forward to  his future writings on IQ. He is one of the few evolutionary psychologists  (who study human universals) who is also a behavioral geneticist (who study  human differences). We're desperately in need of somebody who can  synthesize the two fields. Miller has the talent, and hopefully he can  muster the courage to shatter the Tooby-Cosmides party line that thinking  about human differences is evil, or boring, or just not done in polite  society, or whatever their latest reason is. <br />Despite these missing  pieces, &quot;The Mating Mind&quot; is an impressive launch to what should  be an impressive career.<br />Steve Sailer -- President, Human Biodiversity  Institute ---	2000-06-15

Nor in it's own way does great propaganda. In contrast, truly important scientific books render themselves obsolete by opening new fields for subsequent scholars to elaborate. Edward O. Wilson's  1975 landmark Sociobiology, which introduced neo-Darwinism to the  public--and which has now been reissued to mark its 25th anniversary--is  just such a book. Vast yet coherent, Sociobiology demonstrated in rigorous  detail how Darwinian selection molded the various ways in which all  animals--from the lowly corals to the social insects to the highest  primates--compete and cooperate with others of their own species.<br />Outraging the leftists who dominated academia, Wilson suggested numerous  analogies between animal and human societies. While men have drawn such  parallels since long before Aesop, Wilson's command of natural history and  the power of neo-Darwinian theory in unifying this vast body of knowledge  lent credibility to his grand ambition to reduce social science to a branch  of biology, just as, Wilson argued, biology could ultimately be reduced to  chemistry and chemistry to physics. .<br />Tom Wolfe has lauded Wilson as  &quot;the new Darwin,&quot; but that's somewhat overstating the case.  Wilson is more the workaholic synthesist who brought to wide awareness the  insights of even more original but lesser-known sociobiologists like the  manic-depressive Robert Trivers and the late English genius William D.  Hamilton. It was Hamilton who launched the neo-Darwinian era in 1964 with  his theory of &quot;kin selection,&quot; which mathematically answered a  question that had long nagged Darwin: Why do social creatures, whether ants  or humans, tend to be nepotistic? Why do we sacrifice for our children and  even for our more distant relatives? Hamilton showed that acting  altruistically toward your kin can be in your genes' self-interest even  when it's not in your own. Richard Dawkins, another sociobiologist inspired  by Hamilton, popularized this insight in his 1976 bestseller The Selfish  Gene.<br />Only the last of Sociobiology's 26 chapters is devoted solely to  human societies, yet it blazed a trail that many others followed. In recent  years, this genre has become wildly popular with readers of serious  nonfiction books. Amazon.com lists 416 titles under  &quot;sociobiology&quot; and 1,218 under &quot;human evolution.&quot; While  Wilson's archenemy, the Marxist media hound Stephen Jay Gould, has largely  been reduced to negativity and obfuscation, many others have responded  gallantly to Sociobiology's challenge. Among the most enjoyable  introductions to neo-Darwinism are The Third Chimpanzee by the bracing  Jared Diamond and How the Mind Works by the entertaining Steven Pinker.  Matt Ridley's Thatcherite perspective adds rigor to The Red Queen and The  Origin of Virtue. Robert Wright's neoliberal The Moral Animal is a good  read but sometimes tries to make Darwinism sound like a beta release of  Clintonism.<br />Despite the success of neo-Darwinism in answering some  fundamental questions about human behavior and in attracting many of the  best minds of our time, it has not been terribly popular with either left  or right. Ironically, while the religious right futilely attacks Darwin's  theory of what we evolved from, the left clamps down upon Darwin's theory  of what we evolved to. The left has long denounced sociobiological research  for validating what conservatives have assumed all along: that human  nature--with its sex differences and its stress on individual, family, and  ethnic self-interest--is an innate heritage, not a blank slate that can be  wiped clean by speech codes, sensitivity workshops, and re-education camps.<br />Not that the left hasn't tried: Stalin shipped his Darwinists to the  Gulag. In the politically correct West, evolution-oriented scientists  haven't been murdered. Yet Wilsonhad a bucket of ice water poured on his  head, IQ scientist Arthur Jensen needed a bodyguard, the police  investigated racial difference scholar J.P. Rushton for six months, the U.  of Edinburgh fired IQ researcher Chris Brand despite 26 years of tenure,  and a mob of protestors beat up Hans Eysenck, Britain's most prominent  psychologist.<br />Wilson's orthodox Darwinian sociobiology made it countless  enemies in academia. Centrist anthropologists John Tooby and Leda Cosmides  accordingly re-launched sociobiology under the neutral name of  &quot;evolutionary psychology.&quot; Pronouncing themselves the truest True  Believers in equality, Tooby &amp; Cosmides portrayed human nature as  almost monolithically uniform, and proclaimed that evolutionary psychology  should only study human similarities.<br />But while egalitarianism served as  a useful cover story for infiltrating neo-Darwinism into academia, it  proved a largely useless methodology for learning about humanity. Why?  Because knowledge consists of contrasts. To learn much about human nature,  we need to look for patterns of similarities and differences among humans.  Ironically, therefore, evolutionary psychology has become primarily the  study of sex differences.<br />You might think that conservatives would give  sociobiology a sympathetic hearing, if only because anything Steven Jay  Gould abhors can't be all bad. And, indeed, many rightwing heavyweights  like James Q. Wilson (The Moral Sense), Francis Fukuyama (The Great  Disruption), and Charles Murray (&quot;Deeper into the Brain,&quot; NR,  January 24, 2000) have increasingly built their worldviews upon a Darwinian  plinth. Tom Wolfe's A Man in Full is The Great Human Biodiversity Novel.<br />This is a natural evolution for American conservatism. After all, Darwin  himself was crucially inspired by the free market economics of conservative  icon Adam Smith. And as Pope John Paul II's endorsement of Darwinism  demonstrated, the theory of natural selection is reasonably compatible with  the main creeds in the Judeo-Christian tradition, except for the kind of  ultra-literalist fundamentalism that makes a fetish out of the universe  being created in 4004 B.C.<br />Having shot itself in the foot over Galileo,  the Roman Catholic has wisely learned not to bet its prestige on one side  of a scientific controversy. Science works best with theories that are  falsifiable, religion with beliefs that aren't. Creationism, an extremely  easily falsified theory, just makes religion in general look stupid.  Similarly, when conservatives are excessively solicitous of the feelings of  Creationists, they end up looking dim, too. Worse, anti-Darwinism keeps  conservatives from noticing that neo-Darwinian science is corroborating and  extending much of the conservative world-view.

Much of what little  gets published today is simply self-esteem therapy, like Henry Louis Gates'  silly new coffee table book that accompanied his embarrassing PBS  miniseries about the supposed architectural treasures of black Africa,  although he wasn't actually able to find many. <br />In contrast, John Reader  pulls off the difficult feat of being both highly sympathetic toward black  Africans and quite realistic about their relative lack of tangible  accomplishments. For example, although Africans' accomplishments in music  and personal decoration were outstanding, their architectural achievements  (the purported main topic of Gates' documenataries) is neglible. Other than  in peripheral regions like Ethiopia and Zanzibar where black Africans came  in contact with other races, there are almost zero ruins of any size. The  main exception are the tall walls of Great Zimbabwe, but Reader's depiction  is much less ecstatic than Gates': Reader says the most amazing thing about  Great Zimbabwe is that it's in sub-Saharan Africa. The quality of  construction is &quot;poor&quot; -- it's just a lot of local flat stones  piled on top of one another. Nor did it require an enormous mobilization of  manpower on the scale of the Pyramids -- a contemporary dry wall contractor  gave an estimate of 200 men working for one year to build it. In Reader's  view, Africa was traditionally too underpopulated and under-urbanized to  generate impressive cities in the black heartland. He gives a variety of  reasons. A major one is the horrendous burden of tropical diseases like  sleeping sickness and malaria. Africans tended to be too sick to have a lot  of surplus energy left over after they fed themselves to spend on  construction projects. Further, it was healthiest to live spread out across  the countryside, not in disease-infested cities. Another big problem was  elephants. Elephants love to eat crops. These and Readers' other arguments  are plausible, but to make them fully convincing, he'd have to explain why  other tropical regions like Southern India and Southeast Asia (e.g., Angkor  Wat) where there were also lots of diseases and elephants weren't equally  debilitated. <br />I would also probably have emphasized the African family  structure -- which tends toward polygamy with a relatively small role for  the father in supporting his wives and kids -- as a playing a sizable role  in Africa's traditional economic shortcomings, since it tends to encourage  men to compete against each other for more wives rather than encouraging  each man to support his own wife, and thus team up with other husbands in  cooperative projects.Nonetheless, this is an impressive work, and well  worth reading.	2000-01-05

Titles include &quot;Delilah and the Space Jockey.&quot; They are written for adults, but, unlike his later stuff, there's no sex in them.  They are part of his Future History series. Most of them are set in, say,  1980 to 2050 -- the early days of space travel.<br />Each tale is quite solid,  with an interesting psychological twist. I read it straight through, with  considerable enjoyment. Still, this book is mostly for Heinlein devotees.  Heinlein's a great novelist, but the short story is too limited a form for  him to exercise his vast gifts of painting a society in all its variety.  And these short stories seem a little more perfunctory than his others.  This book is one of his least memorable -- I was halfway through it before  I realized I'd already read it a couple of decades ago. If you've already  read 20 Heinlein books, then this is a good choice to round out your  collection. If you haven't read any Heinlein yet, then you'd be much better  off starting with almost anything from his peak years of roughly 1950  through 1966's great &quot;The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress.&quot; (Although  I'd be wary of the self-indulgent &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;,  and the uncompelling &quot;Glory Road.&quot;) -- Steve Sailer,	1999-10-21

How can you, he asks, &quot;create a classless society by establishing a system that relentlessly classifies people&quot;? But the bigger question is one Lemann relentlessly dodges: Can you create a classless society at all? The Khmer Rouge came closest, but to enforce classlessness, they still had to have two classes: the killers and the killees.<br />In the endless debate over mental tests, there's one sure-fire test of how morally serious an author is. Does he honestly grapple with the raw, hulking fact of human intellectual inequality? Lemann flunks his personal Big Test badly, as he spends 343 pages sidestepping this central reality. <br />The problem is that some people are simply smarter than other people. Yes, it helps to go to good schools and have parents who read to you and all that. Still, siblings raised in the same home routinely turn out highly different in intelligence. Even fraternal twins raised side by side aren't very similar. Only identical twins, who share the same DNA, tend to come out alike in IQ. <br />Is it fair that winners in this genetic lottery tend to be better able to provide for themselves? Of course not.  But the relevant question for us is: What we do about it? Do we try to equalize mental ability? (Whacking smart kids on the head with a ball-peen hammer would be the most effective way.) Or do we treat brainpower as a precious natural resource that can benefit all of society?<br />Paradoxically, by focusing on usefulness rather than fairness, IQ tests like the SAT have helped eliminate much blatant unfairness. They've shown that discrimination is expensive. For example, everyone assumed men were smarter than women until pioneering IQ researcher Cyril Burt announced they were equal way back in 1912. After WWII when colleges began competing on their students' average SAT scores, they found that the easiest way to get more bright students was to stop discriminating against women. Similarly, this competition for brains also induced Ivy League colleges to finally stop mistreating Jews, the highest scoring ethnic group. <br />The Math portion of the SAT has been a huge boon to Asian immigrants. Software engineer and journalist Arthur Hu responds to Lemann's snide history of the SAT: &quot;My father and mother from China sent 7 kids to MIT and Stanford on the basis of high SAT scores. Six of us are now in high tech and the other is a doctor. Isn't this exactly what the people who invented the SAT had in mind?&quot;<br />Although Lemann shows no interest in technologists, we should note that the Math SAT has been a huge boon to American prosperity. It liberated a group so dispersed and downtrodden that it didn't even have a name until about 30 years ago: nerds. By identifying nerdy geniuses in high schools across the world, many of whom were too bored to make good grades, the Math SAT enabled them to form critical masses of computer geeks in nerd havens like Stanford and MIT. Out of these colleges grew the great high-tech incubators such as Silicon Valley and Route 128, which are the engines of the current American boom. <br />The effects of the Verbal SAT are more troublesome, though. Certainly it has bestowed upon America more clever lawyers, but that is, shall we say, a mixed blessing. <br />The Verbal SAT has also allowed America's future elite of journalists, academics, and policy wonks to cluster together at Ivy League universities at an early age. There they form career-boosting friendships with like-minded young verbalists.  <br />That the SAT jumpstarts the careers of brilliant young scientists and engineers is an unmixed blessing because their precocious creativity is tested against unforgiving reality: If their Hot New Idea turns out to be wrong, their bridge falls downor their computer program bombs. Verbal SAT elitism, however, brings together at an early age the young people with the most dazzling rhetorical talents who can thus mesmerize each other with their soaring theories of how the world ought to work ... long before they have a clue about how the world actually works. <br />For example, for 20 years Lemann's neoliberal friends have been publicly attacking IQ testing and the SAT. Lemann's big book was to be their coup de grace. Year after year he searched for flaws in the numbers and logic of the IQ realists like Arthur Jensen and Charles Murray. And then ... Lemann punted. Those hoping for a refutation of The Bell Curve in The Big Test will be disappointed. In fact, in this purported history of testing, there are almost no numbers and not much more logic. Left with apparently nothing analytical to say about intelligence that wouldn't embarrass either his friends or the truth, Lemann padded his book with endless personal details about some excruciatingly boring people. Fortunately for Lemann, since his natural audience of liberal verbalists aren't too comfortable with either numbers or logic, they'll no doubt appreciate having neither their mental skills nor their prejudices challenged. In summary, the best example of the nefarious impact of the SAT is Lemann's own book.	1999-10-13

He initially likes how there isno sharp color line based, as in the U.S. where &quot;one drop&quot; of African blood makes you &quot;black.&quot; However, he eventually notices that it doesn't seem to make much difference in terms of who succeeds in the country. The people at the very top are all white and at the very bottom (leaving aside the Indians) are all black, and for all those in between, where you end up in life seems to correlate fairly closely with skin color. The most notable exceptions, as in the U.S., are star black athletes and entertainers. One might think that the fact that two separate social systems generate the same racial pattern of accomplishments might spark Robinson's curiosity, but that topic is left untouched. It's a pity he was never assigned to any black-ruled African countries. That might have opened his eyes.<br />He becomes convinced that black Brazilians are being held back by their lack of racial consciousness. If they organized themselves as a racial pressure group, like African-Americans have, they could demand racial quotas (of the kind which presumably have benefited the author's career at the Washington Post). <br />Unfortunately, besides the usual problems caused by affirmative action, there's a specific reason why it wouldn't work well in Brazil: because the races aren't so easily distinguished there, it wouldn't be clear who &quot;deserves&quot; to benefit from quotas. Due to the one drop rule and social pressures against miscegenation (including lynching), there really aren't that many people in the U.S. who are mostly white but a little black. (Most of the ones you can name are actresses or models like Jennifer Beals, because long hair and other white features tend to be more in demand on women than on men.) Down through the generations in the U.S., people with any African blood have been socially discouraged from marrying whites.This has tended to mean that a mulattos' descendents seldom get whiter and normally get darker. As the line against miscegnation deteriorated in the last three decades, the number of young mostly-white American people has started to grow, but it's still small. Thus, in America you find two easily distinguishable groups: whites (who very rarely have any African blood) and &quot;blacks&quot; (who normally have white blood, but seldom much more than 50%). Thus, here it's not hard for bureaucrats to decide whether somebody qualifies for affirmative action or not. <br />In contrast, in Brazil, you have a whole bunch of people who are at least mostly white but may or may not have some black blood. Do they qualify for affirmative action? Ultimately, millions of individual decisions about who gets the special privileges would have to be made by bureaucrats. If I know anything about Brazil, bribery would be rampant. Thus, a great amount of the quotas will end up being filled by wealthier near-whites, at the expense of impoverished blacks.	1999-08-06

Unfortunately, the Lord's popular policy of appeasing  Nazi Germany ultimately leads to disaster. Stevens is thus left to meditate  on whether his life had any purpose. He is left mouthing platitudes about  the importance of setting an example of professionalism to other butlers,  which the author implies is just pathetic rationalization.<br />The problem is  that Ishiguro misses the key point that a real Stevens would have  understood: Very few can accurately discern the future course of global  events; rare statemen like Churchill are, by definition, rare. But the rest  of us can contribute in other ways: for example, by setting an example of  professionalism in our particular career for others to aspire to. After  all, although Stevens happened to be employed by this Chamberlain-like  figure, he could just as easily have been Churchill's butler. And then he  would have been celebrated as the butler whose selfless devotion helped  Churchill save the world. That it didn't happen that way was pure chance,  but that Stevens did the best he could within the circumstances he was  dealt to set a sterling example for other professional servants to emulate  (such as Churchill's own much-abused staff) redounds to Stevens' credit.  Clearly, Stevens lead a worthy and honorable life.<br />That Ishiguro blows it  at the end should not distract too much from the novel's many delightful  qualities. However, if you are looking for a similar novel of equal  virtues, but with a more sensible and unconventional moral view, try John  Derbyshire's &quot;Seeing Calvin Coolidge in a Dream.	1999-04-22

His famous 1996 Forbes ASAP essay on Edward O.  Wilson demonstrated  that he has been grounding himself in the latest Neo-Darwinian thinking  about how differences in sex, race, and sexual orientation impact society.  Like the evolutionary psychologists (e.g., Steve Pinker), he's obsessed  with how reproduction leads to the sex differences that make up the bedrock  of human nature. Like the students of human biodiversity (e.g., me),  Wolfe's fascinated by how race differences resemble faint sex differences:  for example, few serious novels have been more concerned with its  characters muscle to fat ratios. This may seem superficial but it's not,  since muscle and fat percentages correlate with male and female hormones,  which in turn correlate with personality and behavior (e.g.,  aggressiveness).<br />Wolfe has been noticing racial differences in  muscularity at least since Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers almost 30 years ago  (recall Wolfe's description of how white bureaucrats fear hard-muscled  black protestors, are less afraid of Mexicans, are not afraid of Chinese,  and are dumb-founded by the massive Samoans), so it's not as if his recent  readings in neo-Darwinism have radically altered his world-view -- instead  they've merely brought organizing principles to his decades of obversations  of humanity.	1998-12-29

It won some plaudits for its literary  ambitiousness, but Bronson's overkill on the pointlessness of his  characters' lives left a bit of a sour taste. This novel, a fictionalized  story of the inventions of the Network PC and Java by a small Silicon  Valley start-up, is far less stylized, but the characters are more likable,  idealistic, and inspiring. This is to Bombardiers as Wolfe's The Right  Stuff was to his Bonfire. <br />The depiction of computer nerds strikes me as  realistic and sympathetic, although I'm sure not all Silicon Valley geeks  appreciate the portraits. I also liked another realistic touch: there is no  sex in the novel, and almost no women characters. This contrasts well with  the other Silicon Valley start-up novel, Douglas Coupland's Microserfs,  which starts out with a terrific portrait of life as a sleep-deprived  minion of Bill Gates, then degenerates into a pilot for a sit-com that  could be pitched as &quot;It's like the cast of 'Friends' starts a software  company.&quot;<br />I was especially impressed by how Bronson set up certain  characters to be the villians of the plot, then showed us that from inside  their heads they see themselves, with some justification, as the good guys.  The conclusion is quite surprising: the most Machiavellian of the bad guys  gets exactly what he was conniving for (a huge investment by a venture  capital firm), then has to live with the bureaucratic consequences. I ended  up feeling quite sorry about his plight.<br />Bronson is probably the most  true-blue member of the small School of Wolfe (Richard Price is the senior  member, with Jay McInerney floating in and out). I haven't yet figured out  whether he has a huge amount of literary talent, or whether he'll simply be  a very useful recorder of The Way We Live Now, but in either case he's  worth reading. One big threat to his chances of becoming a great novelist  is that he is probably the most handsome novelist since Hemingway, and that  can cause no end of trouble.<br />Steve Sailer	1998-12-17

There is some truth to this: for example, the Nixon administration invented quotas to fight blatant discrimination by craft  unions in Philadelphia, and it's hard to imagine any other tactic working  to end discrimination by unions devoted to enforcing anti-competitive,  nepotistic hiring. Unfortunately, Gutman makes no attempt to distinguish  anti-competitive organizations from competitive ones, which have economic  incentives to not discriminate. In fact, I don't think Gutman is even aware  of the distinction. She merely assumes that if blacks are under-represented  anywhere, it's because of discrimination. Well, we've certainly heard that  before, so what's the point of writing another book if you're just going to  repeat the same old dogmas?<br />Appiah, on the other hand, is a more open and  intriguing thinker. This may stem from the near-comic ironies of his  position in life. He is a Professor of Afro-American Studies at Harvard,  but he's not very Afro-American. He was born in Ghana of a local father and  an English mother. He has spent a lot of his career arguing that  &quot;race&quot; has no biological &quot;essence,&quot; but is just a  social construct.<br />It's not hard for him to knock down the absurd  strawmen he sets up. He assumes that if there is no Platonic essence to  each race, and that if each member of each race can't be perfectly  identified, the whole concept of race must be discarded. Of course, reality  is not Platonic, it's relativistic and probabilistic. It's humorously  hypocritical for a relativist like Appiah to denounce the concept of race  just because it's relativistic.<br />For example, all his criticisms of the  concept of race apply with equal, if not greater, force to the concept of  family. Nobody can agree on the precise numbers of races? Nobody can agree  on the precise number of extended families either. Are some people  descended from more than one race? Well, everybody is descended from more  than one family. There's no single gene that proves you belong to one race  or another? Well, there's no single gene that proves you are your father's  child either. Paternity testers examine a host of genes in order to  increase the probability of a correct attribution. (In fact, the exact same  DNA techniques are used by forensic scientists to inform police of the  probable race of criminal who left a bloodstain at the crime scene.)<br />Why  does family provide so many perfect analogies for race? Because they aren't  analogies: a race is an extremely extended family. There are no hard and  fast borders between families and races -- the only qualitative difference  is that races show a degree of endogamy (in-breeding), which means that  races are actually somewhat more coherent and definite, and less fuzzy than  families.	1998-11-26

Wilson	Van Den Berghe is a white sociologist born in the old Belgian colony of the Congo. Disgusted by white oppression of Africans, he became a fairly conventional liberal on race relations. But, as he overcame his Eurocentric  focus on white crimes, he realized that race-based exploitation and  violence are universal human curses. This lead him to sociobiology, and its  bedrock finding: the theory of kin selection: The more genes we share with  another individual, the more altruistic we are toward him. And the less  kind we are toward our more distant kin.<br />Since there is no fundamental  boundary between family, ethnic group, and race, Van Den Berghe coined the  brilliant term &quot;ethnic nepotism&quot; to describe the human tendency  to favor &quot;our people&quot; at the expense of others.<br />This is the  most significant advance ever in the Marxist analysis of economic  exploitation. By substituting kinship for class as the great engine of  history, Van Den Berghe has invented a neo-Darwinian Marxism with enormous  explanatory power and predictive power.

Nonetheless, many of his views  on the ancestry of different populations, based on morphology, linguistics,  archaeology and the like, have been confirmed by recent genetic testing  (see Cavalli-Sforza's &quot;History and Geography of Human Genes&quot; --  and, please, do read C-S' book, don't just satisfy yourself with C-S's  deceitful cover stories about how poltically correct his finding  are.)<br />Baker's focus in the concluding chapters is on different races'  capabilities to found a civilization. He gives a 23 point test of whether a  culture can be reasonably considered a civilization, and examines various  races' accomplishments in this regard. This book is worth reading in tandem  with Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize-winning &quot;Guns, Germs, and  Steel,&quot; in which Diamond argues that every racial group in the world  did as well as any other group could have with the resources of that  region. Baker anticipated a number of Diamond's arguments and refutes them  (e.g., could sub-Saharan Africans have put elephants to work like Asians  and Carthaginains did?), but the truth probably lies somewhere between the  two authors' views.<br />Baker's exploration of the capability of different  groups to start true civiliations is certainly interesting, yet, I wonder  how relevant this question is to the modern world. The Japanese, for  example, have shown relatively little talent at originating a civilization,  but vast skill at borrowing others' novel ideas and adapting and, often,  improving them. Similarly, the question of whether Africans could have  invented a civilization on their own is interesting, but it's not as  germane asBaker seems to assume to the more pressing question of how  African-Americans can best fit into the existing American civilization.  Further, some groups that did little to build their own civilizations, and  still seem to have a certain amount of trouble fitting into others'  civilizations -- e.g., sub-Saharan Africans and the Irish -- have  contributed an extraordinary amount to the culture of modern life.<br />Steve  Sailer	1998-11-25

In fact, the parts of his book that liberals objected to most vehemently stem logically from his application of politically correct principles. Here are the disastrous assumptions that drained much of the value from a book so chock-full of information and intelligence about minor matters (e.g., his discussion of rational discrimination by cab-drivers is excellent). D'Souza's assumptions: <br />1. The word &quot;racism&quot; is still a useful and meaningful term. In contrast, I would suggest that &quot;racism&quot; has become to the 90's what &quot;unAmericanism&quot; was to the 50's: a smear word intended to shut off logical thought. <br />2. That whites invented racism. In contrast, I would suggest that favoring those who are genetically related to you, and disfavoring those who aren't is a human universal. Its origin lies in a form of natural selection called kinship selection, which encourages us to favor the reproductive success of our genes not only within our own bodies, but within the bodies of people we share those genes with. See William Hamilton or Richard Dawkins [The Selfish Gene] for the math. <br />3. That the definition of a &quot;racist&quot; is someone who believes there are genetic differences among the races. This is the exact equivalent of a 19th century bishop saying that the definition of a &quot;sinner&quot; is someone who believes humans are descended from apes. The question of genetic differences is an empirical issue, not a matter of faith. That people who are married to a member of another race very often believe in the importance of genetic differences should give anybody pause who tries to glibly equate racist and hereditarian. <br />4. That behavioral differences among races stem solely from cultural differences. Obviously, this culture-only dogma begs the question of where cultural differences came from. Also obviously, the evidence for genetic differences among races is overwhelming, as any honest man who watches sports on TV can testify. In fact, D'Souza provides an excellent summary of some of the evidence for the reality and significance of genetic differences ... then simply rejects it all with no more explanation that that it's &quot;too suspect to count.&quot; <br />5. That because genetics counts for nothing, everything that's wrong with black society today is the result of black culture. This is what drove so many blacks and white liberals into frothing rages over the book.  In contrast, a realist perspective would suggest a much more positive perspective on African-American culture. Much of what's distinctive about African-American culture is descended from West African culture, which is, from the Darwinian point of view of reproductive success, a rational adjustment to conditions prevailing in West Africa in ages past. Unlike in the cold north, where male hunters provided most of the food to survive the winter and thus wives were expensive, in West Africa most women could gather enough to feed themselves and their children year-round, making husbands into expensive luxuries, who had to justify themselves by being sexy. This economic fact of life allowed men to have more wives than was affordable in hunting-dependent climes. The affordability of having many wives increases the competition among men, which manifested itself both in fighting among men and in wooing of women via talk, song, dance, etc. (The African-American pimp-ho relationship is an extreme version of this.) The male losers in these struggles failed to pass on their genes, while the winners had lots of kids who would carry onward their genes for muscularity (useful in fighting other men), handsomeness, charisma and improvisational ability (useful both in becoming a leader of men, and in attracting women).  <br />Thus, the economic situation inherent in West Africa became embedded over time in the genes, producing a race that's especially talented at physically competing against other men for women and in charming women.  Thus, African-American culture is hardly the all-around bleak failure described by D'Souza, but is outstanding at producing personalities to fill many of the most popular roles in American society: athlete, entertainer, Army general, politician, preacher, plaintiff's attorney, etc. It's failings are largely the flip side of its successes. The high crime rate, for example, stems from the same high degree of masculinity, which makes African-Americans good soldiers and great athletes.<br />This is not to say that, for instance, today's high crime rate among blacks is permanent. It suggests, however, that solutions will have to be crafted that take into account black's higher degree of masculinity, and try to direct that potent energy into socially positive directions. That's why the highly masculine Army, for example, succeeds better at giving blacks the values they need to succeed than do do-gooder programs. Similarly, the black advantage over whites at mental improvisation (so visible in basketball, jazz, preaching, rap, etc.) suggests that blacks would tend to do best at jobs like sales where improvisatory ability and male charisma are most valuable.	1998-10-12

This is clearly evident in sports, muscularity, crime, popular entertainment, technology, even interracial marriage, where 72% of black-white marriages are black husband-white wife, while 72% of white-Asian marriages are white husband-Asian wife (1990 Census).<br />Even though many people have noticed this pattern, Rushton deserves a huge amount of credit for putting it in print. Sadly, we live in an era whose motto seems to be &quot;Remain oblivious to the obvious&quot;. Rushton has had to endure Orwellian persecutions for his contribution to scholarship.	1998-10-11

Levin, a professor of philosophy at CCNY in Harlem, grapples with an extremely street-level issue: why do African-Americans commit violent felonies almost an order of magnitude more often than other Americans? A frequent victim of muggings by blacks himself, Levin offers a simple answer: blacks tend to be less intelligent and more impulsive.  It's certainly bracing to watch Levin simply destroy the conventional wisdom on the subject. Nonetheless, it appears to me that Levin's personal experience at the hands of black muggers leaves him uninterested in trying to think of much to do about black crime. In 1930 whites outnumbered blacks in prison by 3.5 to 1. The Great Leap Forward in black crime occurred in the mid-60's. Was the cause the civil rights revolution, the increase in welfare payments, the drug wave, or what? These non-genetic questions are very relevant today, but Levin has little to say about the historical record. Whether Levin likes it or not, we're all in this together, and we're not going to get out of it without an approach that's both realistic and pro-black.	1998-10-11

Not surprisingly, C-S loudly asserts a series of pious cover stories about the meaning of his work, even though the wonderful data he accumulates subverts fashionable ideas like &quot;There is no such thing as race.&quot; Obviously, people can't agree on exactly how many races there are, what to call them, or precisely who is in them. But the same criticisms can also be made of the concept of &quot;extended family,&quot; but that doesn't mean extended families don't exist. The reason for the similarity between the concepts of race and extended family is simply because races are extremely extended families. <br />Similarly, C-S likes to say there is far more differentiation within groups than between groups. Of course, in reality it all depends on which trait you are talking about. Consider the job of identifying individuals for police investigations. Fingerprint variation is largely individual, skull shape is a mixture of individual and racial, while the general appearance of a living person (the gestalt of skin color, hair, facial features, etc.) is largely racial. <br />Fortunately, C-S doesn't seem to take his politics seriously, so he plows ahead with the world's best research into genetic differences.<br />C-S's genetic diagrams point to a reasonably coherent 5 or 6 race model: Indo-Europeans (Caucasians); sub-Saharan Africans; Amerindians (related to Asians of course); Papuan/Australians; and East Asians, who can either be thought of as one race or as two divided into Northeast Asians and Southeast Asians. There are of course a number of smaller groups that don't fit the model particularly well.<br />This book, written for a general audience, is especially larded with political correctness. His more technical and more expensive books are more informative.	1998-10-11

While, for some mysterious (probably hormonal) reason, I love &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; more, this book certainly is the ideal introduction to Heinlein's novels for adults. <br />It's literary merits are all the more surprising considering both it's abundant slam-bang action and it's status as a treatise on libertarianism. Moreover, for a work of ideological propaganda, it is clear-eyed about what you'd have to put up with to live in a libertarian society. Without the government to look after you, Heinlein points out that you'd have to make sure you are on very friendly terms with all your neighbors. Extreme neighborliness is a requirement for a libertarian society (Charles Murray reiterated this point in his recent &quot;What It Means to Be a Libertarian&quot;). Personally, as a surly introvert, the lack of privacy and the social conformity required to function in a stateless society would get on my nerves so bad, that I'd probably make myself a nuisance to all my neigbors, and no doubt they'd be justfied in eventually tossing me out an airlock. So, maybe I don't really want to live in a truly libertarian society. But, it's well worth visiting one in the company of a great mind like Heinlein's.	1998-10-09

Books	4	14	14	N	N	Unusual but plausible ideas on origins of human biodiversity	Jonathan Kingdon is an English biologist who was born and raised in Kenya.  He is an expert on East African animals, including that most fearsome of African-born predators, man. Here he examines human evolution, especially the relatively recent diversification of our species into countless ethnic groups. How did the major races originate? And what role did tool-making play in our evolution? Kingdon is inspired by a deep love of human variability, as his lovely pencil drawings of the people he has encountered around the world make clear. Everybody talks about &quot;celebrating diversity&quot; these days, but in practice that usually means the opposite: trying to prevent anybody from noticing the kaleidoscopic biodiversity of the human race. Kingdon dissents from this anti-knowlege, anti-human dogma.<br />One of his most interesting speculations is that modern black Africans (as opposed to the older, lighter-skinned aboriginal pygmies and bushmen) actually originated outside Africa. He believes that modern humans first originated in Africa, then spread throughout the Old World.  These were probably brown rather than black in color, because most people don't need the extreme degree of sun resistance that black skin provides -- only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun. Everybody else has enough sense to take a siesta when the sun is high. However, one lifestyle would require tremendous sun-resistance: beachcombing. Collecting clams, fish, and other water's edge life requires being out in the sun whenever low tide occurs. Kingdon hypothesizes that around the Indian Ocean a race of beachcombers became adapted via natural selection to the sun, then returned to conquer Africa and drive the native pygmies, bushmen, and hottentots into the margins of Africa. In support, he cites the odd fact that small remant populations of very black African-looking people are found here and there many thousands of miles to the east of Africa: e.g., the &quot;negritoes&quot; ofthe Maldive Islands (south of Calcutta), Malaysia, and the Phillipines, as well as the larger blacks of Melanesia in the Pacific. There is little archaeological evidence to support this theory, but that would not be surprising since ocean levels are much higher today than during the Ice Ages. Hopefully, the Human Genome Diversity Project lead by Cavalli-Sforza will produce definitive evidence pro or con on this ingenious but currently far-from-proven notion.<br />Steve Sailer	1998-10-09

Wilson noted that human beings seem to have some constants in what they like in the natural world. Everybody likes the landscape they grew up in, but there appears to be a surprising consensus, at least among men, in favor of landscape with these features: grassy parklands with intermittent trees, water, high points providing vistas across a complex landscape, and the ability to see but not be seen.  Researchers believe that this represents an inborn affinity toward the superb hunting grounds in which humans evolved in East Africa. From this work, Wilson announced the existence of biophilia, the innate human love of nature, and asserted that this means we should Save the Rainforests (home to most of the species of Wilson's beloved ants).<br />As much as I admire Wilson, I have to point out that his political argument is absolutely not supported by this research, which demonstrates not that humans like all forms of nature but that they have strong opinions about which landscapes they prefer. Reread the description of the consensus pleasurable landscape: does it remind you of anything that modern humans all around the world spend billions upon? Yup, what we males really have an innate affinity for are golf courses. In fact, we probably have an innate aversion toward rainforests, with their snakes, bugs, and lack of sunlight. Humans have largely avoided rainforests throughout our history, and today rainforests are much more popular on the Upper West Side of Manhattan than in the Amazon.<br />None of this implies that we shouldn't Save The Rainforests	1998-10-09

Human uniformity is the bedrock assumption of polite discourse today. Yet, when it comes to making money, humanity may now be further from equality of results than ever before. According to David S. Landes, professor emeritus of both economics and history at Harvard, just 250 years ago the average standard of living in the wealthiest nation on Earth, Great Britain, was only about five times higher than in the poorest nation. Today, the ratio between, say, Switzerland and Mozambique is something like 400 to one. What happened?        <br />The end of the millennium seems to be conjuring up ultra-ambitious History of Everything tomes. Of these, The Wealth and Poverty of Nations may turn out to be the most sensible and enjoyable. It is not, however, a page-turner. Landes describes not just the economic history, but the technological, political, military, religious, cultural, and geographic status, of dozens of countries across almost 1,000 years. Combined with his frequent halts to pummel other authors' bad ideas, he can't generate much narrative momentum. Instead, it's a wonderful page-flipper. Landes' gruff, Walter Matthauish persona, love of argument, and inexhaustible supply of colorful examples makes the book perfect for dipping into at random.        <br />Landes draws upon contemporary scholarship's vast accumulation of detail, while contemptuously dismissing the &quot;Europhobia&quot; and other blinders that keep so many academics from recognizing the main patterns in their data. (As George Orwell noted, &quot;To see what is in front of one's nose requires a constant struggle.&quot;) Landes denounces mainstream academia's dogma of absolute cultural relativism as &quot;an attack on knowledge,&quot; because &quot;distinctions are the stuff of understanding.&quot; Instead, he finds that the 18th Ce! ntury Scottish Enlightenment, exemplified by Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, outlined a more accurate checklist for predicting what makes winners: &quot;markets, markets, markets;&quot; the security of private property; patriotism in defense of the homeland; careers open to talents; trust extending beyond the family; rationalism, skepticism, and argument; curiosity about other cultures; and an intense work ethic, to name a few.       <br />Like Thomas Sowell, Landes is unusual among modern economists in preferring words to equations. Therefore, he doesn't underestimate the hard-to-quantify but cumulatively huge impact of cultural differences. For example, he notes that everybody &quot;comments on the quality of the [East Asian] workforce, but equally takes it somehow for granted.&quot; Digging deeper, Landes attributes the supremacy of the Japanese and other East Asians in micro-assembly in part to the &quot;exceptional manual dexterity that comes with eating with chopsticks.&quot; Also like Sowell, he tries to avoid biological explanations for cultural disparities by emphasizing &quot;nature's inequalities&quot; in geography and weather: e.g., cold climates encourage hard work, warm climates leisure. (Granted, this isn't exactly news to Club Med's management, but for a Harvard professor, these are brave words, indeed.)        <br />Still, Landes' fear of understanding biological distinctions causes his most glaring mistake: his insistence that &quot;gender equality&quot; is crucial to economic development. he insists &quot;gender equality&quot; is a necessity for growth (rather than a pleasant side effect). Males can't &quot;think themselves superior by biology, without dulling [their] ambition.&quot; Sounds plausible, but it wasn't true in Manchester in 1770, in Pittsburgh in 1870, or in Nagoya in 1970. And it's definitely not true in the Silicon Valley in 1998, where female executives are so rare that they have formeda support group named &quot;Babes in Boyland.&quot; Greater sex equality is far less oft! en a necessity for economic growth than a pleasant side effect of it. Ironically, Landes here forgets the famous lesson on p. 1 of Adam Smith's book: the division of labor is the prime creator of wealth. And the oldest division of labor is by sex, as in &quot;hunter-gatherer tribe.&quot; Today, sexual specialization keeps spontaneously re-emerging in new industries like software and drug dealing, revealing its genetic roots.       <br />But biological differences extend beyond sex to race. For example, Landes doesn't bother to ask: why were East Asians able and inclined to adopt chopsticks in the first place? Could it be because they already tended to have small, nimble fingers? He claims that stressing the impact of geographical differences is the anti-racist alternative to admitting the importance of human biodiversity, but that's a shallow dichotomy. The more powerful the environmental diversity, the more natural selection would adapt people to local conditions.         <br />Interestingly, many of the most striking racial differences can be thought of as resembling faint sex differences. For example, contrast the triumph of Japanese manufacturing with Japan's near-total failure in the brutally competitive global market for celebrities. (A recent survey revealed that Americans believe the most famous living Japanese person is Bruce Lee, a dead Chinese guy.) It's the mirror image of African-Americans' undistinguished technological achievements versus their outstanding performance in producing media personalities.        <br />Why? Japanese talents extend far beyond chopstick-handling to a set of extremely masculine intellectual skills. Tests show they tend to excel at objective abilities like mathematics and mentally manipulating 3-d objects through &quot;single-tasking&quot; (focusing deeply upon a one impersonal logical problem). Blacks, on the other hand, are often betterat typically feminine, more subjective cerebral skills like verbalization, emotional intuition and expression, sense of rhythm, sense of sty! le, improvisation, situational awareness, and mental multi-tasking. Michael Jordan's brain, for instance, enables him to anticipate his opponent's every move while simultaneously demoralizing his foe with nonstop trash-talking. (Try it sometime. It's not easy.)        <br />Next, think about physical and emotional/personality traits. Here the races are arrayed in the opposite order. Blacks tend to display more of typically male qualities like muscularity, aggressiveness, self-esteem, need for dominance, and impulsiveness. In contrast, the Japanese economy benefits from a male workforce endowed with more typically feminine virtues like small fingers and fine motor skills, cooperativeness, humility and anxiety, loyalty, long-term orientation, diligence, and carefulness. Combined with their first-rate masculine mental skills, these make Japanese companies powerhouses at exporting superbly engineered machinery.       <br />Compared to Japanese organizations, black communities tend to be physically and psychologically masculine, sometimes to the point of disorderliness. Yet a relatively high percentage of individual black men achieve fame by possessing charismatically masculine looks and personalities, without the nerdishness that Dilbert-style male intellectual skills often induce.       <br />Like astronomer Tycho Brahe's attempt at a compromise between the theories of Ptolemy and Copernicus, Landes's notion that geography influences culture but not genes may someday be seen as a waystation between the 20th Century social scientist's flat-earthish insistence that nothing affects culture except culture, and the 21st Century's exploration of the fascinating interactions among environment, genes, and culture. <br />* * *	1998-06-20

His gift for illustrating the most abstruse workings of the mind with dead-on-the-money examples from the Godfather, or The Simpsons, or the Rolling Stones seems to annoy many (humorless and not really-as-smart-as-they-think-they-are) people no end. Too bad for them.<br />Another reason for the sniffy tone of many of these readers' comments is Pinker's political incorrectness. He considers the Standard Social Science Model of thinking about humanity to be a disaster for American intellectual life.  ...  The one weakness in Pinker's approach is that he tries to restrict the science of human nature to just how all human brains are similar. He's not as self-assured (or bigoted) about this in this book, as in his previous bestseller &quot;The Language Instinct,&quot; but he still acts as if studying how brains differ is totally boring. Of course, he can't actually NOT study mental differences becaus similarities and differences are the warp and woof of information. If we were all the same, you couldn't get a grip on how our brains work. Thus, vast amounts of the data he uses about how (supposedly) all brains work comes from comparisons of healthy brains to stroke-victims and other tragically defective brains. Further illustrating this point, the last third of his book deals mostly with sex differences.  ...  Psychological research has been divided for over a century into the followers of Wundt (like Pinker), the &quot;experimental psychologists,&quot; who emphasize how brains are alike versus the followers of Galton (like Arthur Jensen), the &quot;differential psychologists,&quot; who emphasize how brains differ. This artificial divide is finally collapsing: see Jensen's new &quot;The g Factor&quot; for a detailed account of how the &quot;differential&quot; IQ researchers are using traditional ! &quot;experimental&quot; laboratory techniques like PET scans. The future belongs to the synthesists who are equally concerned with both similarities and differences.  ...  The problem with this, of course, is that humans tend to differ in somewhat predictable patterns. (1) It's now respectable in the harder sciences to discuss sex differences: in fact, evolutionary psychology largely consists of the study of sex differences. (2) However, the study of sexual orientation differences, especially between gay men and lesbians, who differ radically on dozens of traits remains largely off limits. (3) The great taboo, however, is the 3rd dimension of difference: race. (Note how Jensen's masterpiece has been almost utterly ignored.)  ...  The greatest untouched territory in the study of human nature are the fascinating correlations between sex and race. For example, a topic that psychology has yet to examine in any formal fashion is nerdishness, even though the public is fascinated by it at present (no doubt due to the rise of Bill Gates). Clearly, this is a heavily male trait. Clearly, it also differs by race with Northeast Asians being more nerdish on average than whites who tend to be more nerdish than West Africans. Just as clearly, though, African-Americans tend to be more stereotypically male in musculature and personality than whites and especially) Asian-Americans.  ...

He describes the events of his childhood with exactly the same boyish emotions he felt at the time. His account of his struggles with schooling remain justly famous, and there's adventure aplenty in Afghanistan, Cuba, the Sudan, and South Africa.  A great book for boys (or former boys), especially ones with large vocabularies.    ---  Steve Sailer	1998-01-22

For 26 years, this statistically inclined MIT historian has labored to uncover why it was Darwin who originated the theory of natural selection. After building a database of 6,566 scientists and other historic figures from the 16th through the early 20th Centuries, the answer's now obvious to him: Darwin was the 4th child born in his family. To Dr. Sulloway, much of history is literally sibling rivalry writ large, an eternal struggle between conservative, authoritarian, and closed-minded &quot;firstborns&quot; and liberal, rebellious, altruistic, and open-minded &quot;laterborns.&quot; (Pop quiz: Name Sulloway's birth rank and politics.)   Despite the author's tendency to torture his examples to fit his comically obvious prejudice that firstborn = conservative = bad (one of his illustrations of a firstborn with a &quot;conservative ideology&quot; is the Unabomber), there is almost certainly some truth in his general idea. Sulloway's findings agree fairly well with popular stereotypes, the urban folk wisdom of our time. One of his accomplishments is to solidly ground his logic in Neo-Darwinian sociobiology rather than literary movements like Freudianism: sibling rivalry is genetically motivated competition for scarce parental resources. Older, bigger children defend their privileges, while younger kids try to subvert the status quo. As the twig is bent, so grows the tree. (The &quot;only child,&quot; by the way, appear to be too variable to generalize about.)   A careful reading reveals, however, that Dr. Sulloway does not actually explain the cause of Darwin's creativity. It turns out that laterborn scientists are not significantly more innovative. (Kepler, Galileo, Newton, and Einstein were all firstborns. Genius remains largely inexplicable.) Instead, laterborn scientists are merely more receptive to other's innovatory theories, especially when there isn't much evidence one way or another. Once solid data becomes available, this gap rapidly closes. (Firstborns, in turn, seem to deserve some credit for resisting new but bad ideas like phrenology, the once-popular pseudo-science of predicting personality from skull bumps, which laterborns were nine times more likely to favor.)   Birth order, it appears, primarily influences opinions, not accomplishments. Keep in mind that those of us who get our opinions published tend to vastly overrate the historic importance of published opinions.   Despite heroic research efforts, lucid prose style, and admirable zeal for statistically testing hypotheses, at times Sulloway can sound like Matt Groening's Seventh Type of College Professor: The-Single-Theory-to-Explain-Everything-Maniac. (&quot;The nation that controls magnesium controls the universe!!!&quot;) Yet, family dynamics are a curiously impotent Single Theory. No nation can use birth order to control the universe because no nation can control birth order. The great engines of history remain cultural differences propagated through families, not differences between individuals spontaneously generated over and over again within families. For example, in one of his few attempts to explain distinctions between countries, Sulloway cites France's low birth rate and consequent high proportion of firstborns to explain why so many French scientists stubbornly resisted Darwin. Yet, since France's low birthrate continued into the 20th Century, by this logic France's surplus of firstborns should also have made French soldiers loyal conformists, while fast-growing Germany would be saddled with an undisciplined army of too many &quot;born to rebel&quot; laterborns. The events of May, 1940, however, would seem to cast doubt on this reasoning.   When Sullowayleaves the relatively firm ground of scientific history for the swamp of politics, his analysis becomes a bit of a mess, partly because politics itself is messy. Unlike scientific revolutions, most political revolutions -- whether the American revolution, England's Glorious Revolution of 1688, Japan's Meiji Restoration, the Velvet Revolution of 1989, Mussolini's putsch or Hitler's takeover -- contain both radical and conservative elements.   Eventually, somebody may make sense of the relations between birth order and politics, but they'll need a far more sophisticated understanding of politics than Sulloway brings to the job. His first weakness is that he assumes that &quot;conservative,&quot; &quot;liberal,&quot; and &quot;radical&quot; means roughly the same thing in all places and all times. For example, his description of Darwin's politics -- &quot;Darwin was ahead of his time, and his worldview was that of a twentieth-century liberal&quot; -- is a much more accurate portrayal of Sulloway's own ideology. True, Darwin was a &quot;liberal&quot;, but a nineteenth-century free market liberal, infinitely closer in outlook to Milton Friedman than Hillary Clinton. Darwin was linked to the rising tide of survival-of-the-fittest capitalism by blood and marriage (both his mother and wife were Wedgwoods, members of the factory-owning family that developed the first brand name in history); by heavy stock market investments; and by intellectual heritage (the single most important influence on Darwin was economist Thomas Malthus, a follower of Adam Smith). In spirit, Darwinism was Whig free market economics applied to biology.   Further, Sulloway seems not to realize that it's much harder to define what's the orthodoxy to rebel against today than in, say, 1517 (the first year in his database), when the Catholic Church unquestionably defined the intellectual Establishment. He tends to assume scientific progress remains upsetting to conservatives. Yet, beginning in the 1920'swith the discovery that subatomic reality is indeterminate (which flummoxed atheistic determinists), many recent scientific revolutions have proved deeply gratifying to the prejudices of sophisticated conservatives. For example, the now-validated Big Bang theory was long pooh-poohed by the scientific establishment out of anti-religious bias: the Big Bang is disturbingly close to Genesis (&quot;Let there be light&quot;) and Thomas Aquinas' Prime Mover proof for the existence of God.   Most notably, the sociobiologists' ongoing &quot;rediscovery of human nature&quot; validates conservative distrust of the dominant liberal dogma that all differences between humans are the product of social conditioning. Today, the Pope appears more enthusiastic about Darwinism than the self-proclaimed &quot;cultural radicals&quot; who control who gets tenure in university humanities departments.   Paradoxically, by offering even more evidence that human nature is fixed and that the power of state-mandated social reform to advance harmony and happiness is highly limited, Sulloway ends up offering additional reassurance to conservatives in their rebellion against liberal othodoxy.   # # #   Steve Sailer (steveslr@aol.com) is a businessman, writer, and only child.	1998-01-20

SOMETIMES you get what you ask for. Back in 1985 Elaine Showalter, a Princeton English professor specializing in the social history of mental health, concluded her critique of the traditional psychotherapy profession by proclaiming: ``The best hope for the future is the feminist therapy movement.'' By 1997, the mental-health industry has become thoroughly feminized, but Professor Showalter has had second thoughts: ``The therapist's role is more and more to affirm, support, and endorse the patient's narrative, . . . and not to challenge the truth or historical reality of the patient's assertions.'' This credulous atmosphere, she believes, has helped unleash ``hysterical epidemics,'' such as the disgraceful witchhunts for satanic cults running day-care centers. Mrs. Showalter cites five other ``hysterical'' outbreaks: the booms in recovered memory of incestuous abuse, multiple-personality disorders, alien abductions, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and Gulf War Syndrome. For an academic treatise with a first printing of only 7,500 copies, Hystories has already generated quite a backlash. In hounding the author, Chronic Fatigue sufferers have proved especially energetic.   .  .  .  .  .  ..  .    Mrs. Showalter's strongest chapters are on epidemics like the satanic-abuse and alien-abduction scares, whose alleged causes are wholly imaginary; and on Gulf War Syndrome, whose primary cause is real but not specific to that conflict: ``war makes people sick.'' While it may turn out that chemical weapons or sand fleas really did afflict some minority of the sufferers, on the whole GWS appears to be the latest version of what other eras labeled ``shell shock,'' ``battle fatigue,'' or ``post-traumatic stress disorder.'' America must realize that one of the costs of going to war is later paying fully for treatment and disabilityleaves for a substantial number of psychologically injured soldiers, although treating mental traumas as honorable wounds will no doubt let some hypochondriacs and malingerers slip through.     .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Unfortunately, Miss Showalter's literary world view is too black-and-white for those epidemics where some but not all of the patients' stories are true, e.g., incestuous abuse. The acrimony of these debates stems in part from both sides' thinking about all patients as Platonic abstractions (``incest victims'' v. ``hysterics''). In reality, mental health is more like an unsettlingly random pachinko game. The classic case study of how psychological debates tend toward dogmatism has been running for a full century since Sigmund Freud analyzed 18 unhappy young women. After much bullying by Freud, they all produced stories of childhood sexual abuse. First announcing an epidemic of incest, Freud then publicly changed his mind and blamed all the women for repressing Oedipal fantasies. Millions of words have since been written about this controversy. Most feminists contend that all 18 really were incest victims. In contrast, after a decade of listening to the nonsensical narratives that present-day therapists can elicit, Professor Showalter thinks Freud was right to recant.   .  .  .  .. .  .  .  .  .   Few, however, seem to have remarked how unlikely it is that any single diagnosis was right for all 18. In truth, some of the troubled women probably were child-abuse victims, while some others may have been repressing guilty fantasies. Probably a large proportion were suffering from other root problems that weren't understood back then, such as chemical imbalances in the brain that strike largely at random. Serotonin, for instance, acts rather like motor oil for your emotional engine, keeping your mental gears from grinding. It can run low -- often, it appears, just from wear and tear. Since the cause of the emotional illnesses stemming from serotonin shortages is commonly not apparent, victims are susceptible to whatever tall tales (a/k/a hysterical epidemics) their therapists or the media happen to be spreading at the moment. Thankfully, we now have drugs like Prozac, and a new, more pragmatic school of psychiatrists who no longer set out on ideologically motivated searches for the root causes of your unhappiness, but instead concentrate on rebalancing your brain chemistry.   .  .  .  .  . .  ..  .  .   A beneficial side effect of a more realistic conception of hysterical epidemics allows this useful concept to be profitably applied to other current brouhahas where facts and feelings get hopelessly entangled, e.g., date rape and sexual harassment.  .  .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .   This sensible but limited book illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of what has recently become a lonely rump of feminism: ``equity'' or ``rationalist'' feminism. Appalled by the flapdoodle peddled by most feminists today, Mrs. Showalter wearily protests, ``Feminism has a strong Enlightenment, rationalist tradition of debate and skepticism, whose memory I attempt to recover and reassert.'' She bravely points out that the great majority of these epidemics' self-proclaimed victims are women, even the alien abductees. (Gulf War Syndrome, of course, is the exception, but the number of soldiers' wives who have also come down with GWS is striking.)   .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .   Unfortunately, rationalist feminism is itself founded on a death-defying leap of faith: the assumption that there are no biological bases for differences in behavior between the sexes. Thus, equity feminism was much to blame for the imprisoning of so many young women day-care workers on absurd charges of raping children and eating babies. If we know anything about sex abuse, we know it's a solitary male crime, not something women do, especially not in groups. But equity feminism has made such stereotypes unacceptable, so all those young women, whose only crime was that they loved little kids so much they'd work with them for $5 an hour, had to go to jail.   .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .   Further, rationalist feminism's fundamental dogma of sexual uniformity prevents Miss Showalter from grasping why feminist movements are so vulnerable to the irrationalism she despises. It's not because women aren't as smart as men. Although the sexes do differ on average in mathematical skills, women may well be superior in verbal logic. (Try eavesdropping on two teenage girls analyzing the endless possibilities of what some boy really meant when he said, ``Maybe, like, I'll see you around sometime, you know?'') So why, in practice, are the terms ``feminist theory'' and ``scientific theory'' mutually exclusive?   .  .  .  .. .  .  .  .  .   The particular form of rationality that originated in the Enlightenment requires more than just the ability to construct castles of logical conjecture in the air. Galileo wasn't any more ingenious at conceiving interlocking celestial spheres than his ancient rival Ptolemy. What distinguished Galileo, and the Enlightenment in general, was that masculine competitive delight in risking the destruction of your own hypotheses in order to smash the other guy's beautiful celestial spheres of theory. The Enlightenment turned reason into a contact sport. Feminist movements careen into gullibility because women, especially when talking mostly to other women, find it more emotionally difficult than men to treat intellectual debate as a game. Women tend to take it much more personally, closing their minds to opponents and pulling their punches with friends.	1998-01-20

Conformity!).  Today, Americans are running still looser and wilder, scandalizing even  aficionados of human nature in the raw. Yet, the serious media slog on  in explaining our hormone-deranged national circus with threadbare  social environmentalist rubrics (Media Stereotypes! Discrimination!).  But, say you're not quite satisfied, for instance, that the only lesson  of the O.J. Simpson saga is The Need for Domestic Violence Awareness.  Maybe you can't help wondering why our American Othello gets sacks of  love-letters. (&quot;Ooh, O.J., you're so passionate, so dangerous yet  endangered, and, lately, so single!&quot;) Well, uh . . . Socialization!  Victimization!     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .This unilateral intellectual disarmament widens the comically  schizophrenic gap between the mainstream media's words (increasingly  sanctimonious) and pictures (ever more lurid). Text now serves as  politically pious disinfectant for swelteringly pagan images: e.g.,  fashion magazines interlard prim feminists denouncing America's beauty  obsession between supermodel photospreads. To understand what fascinates  us, watch what we watch, not what we say we read.     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .In a country this wide open, people will think about whatever they like  to think about. We even have some inconveniently rigorous thinkers who  enjoy asking: &quot;If society conditions individuals, what conditions  societies?&quot; Yet, despite their insights into sex and aggression, culture  and the creative arts seemed beyond these Neo-Darwinists' ken. Or, so it  appeared until an unknown humanities teacher named Camille Paglia  detailed in Sexual Personae, Volume I (1990) a theory of why we watch  what we watch that finally did justice to the &quot;fantastically complex  interpenetration&quot; of nature and nurture. Paglia traced the disturbing  but indelible imprint of nature on classic Western art and literature,  noting how biology recurrently surfaces in visually charismatic &quot;sexual  archetypes&quot; like the femme fatale.     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .Although sociobiologists like Edward O. Wilson might begin with the  queen bee, while Paglia started with Queen Nefertiti, she reached some  oddly congruent conclusions that made her Public Enemy #1 of orthodox  feminists: e.g., &quot;Despite my deviant and rebellious beginnings, I have  been lead by my studies to reaffirm the most archaic myths about male  and female.&quot; Notwithstanding her NC17-rated subject matter and her  nostalgia for the Rousseauvean Sixties, Paglia's logic often compels her  toward Hobbesian conservatism: e.g., &quot;Society is not the criminal but  the force which keeps crime in check ... [The] rapist is a man with too  little socialization rather than too much.&quot;     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .Her sudden notoriety is due in part to her extraordinary powers of  pattern recognition (she resembles a stand-up comic who's been  channel-surfing for stereotypes since Sumer). But at a time when  &quot;multiculturalists&quot; insist that only members of a group should discuss  that group, Paglia also reconfirms the value of the outsider's  perspective. An outsider among outsiders, she's a lesbian who identifies  with men rather than resents them (her idol is Rolling Stone Keith  Richards). As an odd duck, she can scrutinize masculinity with detached  lucidity, while most men are fish who don't know they're wet.     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .Paglia's third book, Vamps and Tramps, is not Volume 2 of Sexual  Personae, which will systematically extend her analysis to pop culture.  This collection of recent journalism does however frequently follow V.  2's promised theme: &quot;The commercial media . . . sidestep the liberal  censors who have enjoyed such long control over book culture. In film,  popular music, and commercials we contemplate all the daemonic myths and  sexual stereotypes of paganism that reform movements from Christianity  to feminism have never been able to eradicate.&quot; Her tardiness in  completing her masterwork is disappointing but not surprising; as this  straight-to-paperback 532 page compendium exhaustively chronicles, she's  been busy. After having only two (!) articles published in the Seventies  and Eighties, she's grabbed the Nineties by the lapels and won't let go  until she's had her say.     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .Paglia now writes extensively on both current controversies and the  latest month's Scandal of the Century. Although I prefer her as analyst  rather than advocate, even her manifestos are uniquely frank: e.g., she  blasts gay activists as &quot;Stalinists&quot; for their campaigns of intimidation  and sophistry. She also explicates how the Bobbits, the Windsors, Amy  Fisher and Joey Buttafuouco, Woody and Mia and Soon-Yi, and Bill and  Hillary and Paula fit into her grand scheme. Frustratingly for her  critics -- and for admirers who wish she'd get back to scholarship -- by  focusing on the enduring allure of sexual archetypes, Paglia does  explain the appeal of our tabloid divinities more successfully than  normal news pundits trained to emphasize only their supposed novelty.  The crazier the world seems, the saner Paglia sounds.     .    .    .    .    ..    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .Unfortunately, Vamps and Tramps suffers from the mixing of Paglia's  three discordant personae: scholar, polemicist, and celebrity role  model. While never dull, this unabridged compilation can be repetitious.  Because Paglia ties every topic into The Theory, most of her Op-Eds must  include a rushed recap of the tragi-comic worldview she elucidated with  supreme clarity in Sexual Personae's first chapter.     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .But Paglia also wants to be an icon, the role model for 21st Century  women. Although Paglia's &quot;street-wise feminism&quot; is a bracing antidote to  the naivet of conventional feminism, does Paglia really expect many  women to ever deeply identify with her? Or is her natural audience  mostly male? From Rush Limbaugh (who shared a convivial cigar with her)  to Hollywood he-man Oliver Stone (whose Natural Born Killers is a  repulsively literal rendering of a few of Paglia's gorier views on the  human animal), guys can relate to Paglia man to man.     .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .Finally, turbocharging her Amazon side for maximum media impact  aggravates a weakness in a thinker who's heroically ambitious to  comprehend human nature: she can't emotionally identify with mothers. &quot;I  have no talent for motherhood,&quot; she admits in a rare understatement.  (That's why she doesn't notice that the most overwhelming evidence for  the appeal of sexual archetypes is not in museums but toy stores.)  Reproduction is of course central to Paglia's theory, and while she  respects maternal women more than orthodox feminists do, she connects  with childbirth only intellectually. Since superstardom requires emotion  more than intellect, Paglia now exhorts women to follow her in vamping  and tramping fearlessly. She must guard against becoming absorbed in her  singular personality. Otherwise, her edicts could become as unrealistic  for women searching for the security that motherhood demands as that  Michael Jordan advertising slogan &quot;Be Like Mike&quot; was impracticable for  gravity-challenged white boys..	1998-01-20

Although anthologies of black American writing have been published by the score over the last 150 years, this enormous tome is sure to attract much attention, due to the authority of the &quot;Norton Anthology&quot; brand name and the well-deserved celebrity of co-editor Henry Louis Gates, Jr.  The multitalented Dr. Gates somehow manages to be a master political operator in the growth industry of multicultural studies, an impressive researcher into the history of black literature, and a graceful writer for general audiences.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Robert Conquest once observed that professors tend to be most conservative about their own area of expertise. Thus, Dr. Gates proclaims that his anthology defines the &quot;canon&quot; of the &quot;best&quot; African American writing, even though these are normally fighting words within cutting-edge English departments. Lesser multiculturalists disparage the very notion of objective merit and recognized masterpieces. They contend that literary canons are assembled to further the interests of the powerful, and that celebrating artistic excellence instead of social relevance &quot;marginalizes&quot; the poor.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  To my surprise, this book heightened my respect for these philistine cliches of the academic left. In truth, canons are created by and for self-interested elites (but there are many elites besides that all-purpose bogeyman, the White Male Power Structure). The Nile-like length of this book, for example, benefits its 11 editors and other professors of African American literature. By &quot;canonizing&quot; 120 writers (at least a quarter of whom seem seem decent but quite dispensable) they have legitimized a vast supply of subject matter to stoke their specialty's publish-or-perish fires for years to come. In contrast, Gates and Co. were much more cavalier about the needs of those who will try to read their book. To squeeze 2,709 pages into a size that coeds would find &quot;comfortably portable&quot; (or, let's be frank, &quot;tolerably luggable&quot;), they had to specify paper of a thinness (and consequent transparency) seldom seen outside European public lavatories. Because you can see right through to the type on the other side of each page, stay close to a strong reading lamp and a bottle of aspirin.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Dr. Gates defends his old-fashioned philosophy of meritocratic selections as necessary to disprove theories of black intellectual inferiority. (Why this logic should not also rule out other forms of affirmative action remains unexplained.) Of course, no anthology, nor anything else, could prove that any two groups are equal in all ways, since this current dogma of uniform equality is simply not true: humans possess, in varying degrees, so many different skills that any non-random group is bound to be inferior on average to any other group in some manner. Indeed, this anthology reconfirms the inferiority of white Americans in certain mental talents. The most interesting black artists have not tried to demonstrate equality with whites through redundant me-too works. Instead, they have pioneered new forms, from ragtime to rap, that whites would never have dreamed of.  .  .  .  . .  .  .  Indeed, the editors endorse several of the oldest stereotypes about What Blacks' Are Good At. For instance, the Introduction concludes by saluting black literature as &quot;never far removed from the language of music and the rhythmic resonance of the spoken word.&quot; (Appropriately, this is the first literary anthology to be accompanied by an optional CD of songs and speeches).  .  .  .  .  . .  .  This compendium raises the more general question of what is the overall contribution of blacks to American culture? One appealing, if possibly grandiose, perspective might be called the Patriotic Black Chauvinism of blues critic and novelist Albert Murray. In contrast to so many other black literary intellectuals, who've only been employed as professors and who now reside in such hotbeds of African American culture as Amherst and Santa Cruz, Murray is a retired Air Force major living in Harlem. Along with his friend Ralph Ellison (author of Invisible Man) and disciples such as trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, Murray has argued that rather than merely being a pitiful victim of racism, the black man's defiant sense of style makes him the most distinctively representative of Americans. That seems fairly plausible, if unprovable. A cruder version is testable: If America otherwise was as WASPish as Protestant Canada, would blacks by themselves make America a much more interesting place than Canada? Most definitely. (Of course, several other American ethnic groups could claim the same: after all, for better or worse, America is a lot less boring than Canada.)  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  But, where does African American literature rank? Its leading talents are certainly impressive. My personal favorites include turn-of-the-century man of letters James Weldon Johnson, poet Langston Hughes, dramatist August Wilson, and the delightful right-wing memoirist Zora Neale Hurston. Nevertheless, in the hierarchy of black achievement, literature would still have to fall somewhere in the vast middle ground, below the realms where blacks are world-conquering (e.g., music) and above those where they have yet to make much of a mark (e.g., high-tech entrepreneurship).  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  In contrast, the editors view the current state of black literature triumphantly, citing novelist Toni Morrison's 1993 Nobel Prize, a 1994 Atlantic cover story that claimed that blacks have replaced Jews as the leading &quot;public intellectuals,&quot; and the burgeoning African American studies programs. Yet, black writers remain rarer than their abundant publicity would imply. The explanation of this paradox is that blacks dominate one particular topic -- Being Black in America -- which might be the juiciest subject of our era. In contrast, they don't yet publish much on other themes. Notice that you almost never find yourself saying: &quot;Gee, I didn't know that writer is black.&quot; The only author in the anthology that I was surprised to learn was black was science fiction novelist Samuel R. Delaney.  .  .  .  .  . .  .  Specializing in blackness offers many advantages to black writers.  Nonetheless, some disquieting trends are apparent in the final section showcasing 35 current authors. (1) Black writers are increasingly employed by universities, often in teaching poetry-writing workshops and other notorious pyramid schemes. While these are acceptable diversions for wealthy white students, there are obvious ethical questions about organized attempts to lure smart black kids into making disastrous career choices.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  (2) This increasing academicization means black writers now learn more about black history and black literature, but they're also more isolated from modern urban life. Thus, they tend to write less than about black life today and more about simpler, more racist days-gone-by. As we see in the Balkans, those who don't ignore their past are sometimes doomed to overemphasize it.  .  .  .  .  .  .  . (3) In practice, multiculturalism turns out to be monoculturalism: Blacks lecture blacks on blackness, Hispanics teach Hispanics about Hispanicness, etc. Multicultural studies could better aid minorities by being honestly multicultural: by objectively comparing how various ethnic groups' strengths, weaknesses, and strategies have lead to differing successes and failures. In fact, some brave college (an oxymoron?) should experiment with requiring nonblack students to take an African American studies	1998-01-20

Less technological than most of Heinlein's novels, it's set in a distant, vaguely medieval future of empires, aristocrats, and slaves. Yet, the last section of the book changes gears exhiliaratingly when the poor slave boy Thorby arrives on Earth and plunges into a proxy fight to take control of a major corporation	1997-09-05

The soldiers in the book come from practically every society on earth.  The narrator, for example, is a Tagalog-speaking Filipino named Juan Rico. As military sociologist Charles Moskos has pointed out, the reason the U.S. Army succeeds in getting people from a diverse variety of ethnic groups to work together is because it is NOT multicultural: it's monocultural. It imposes a very distinct militaristic culture upon its recruits. And it offers a unifying goal: victory. (Sports teams are similar.) This offers lessons for the rest of our society, especially our elite universities, which are having so much more trouble dealing with ethnic diversity than the military or college athletic squads.<br />Steve Saile	1997-09-05

Only a small % of the population has ever heard of the profession of golf course architect, but a large % of that group dreams of quitting the day job and designing golf  courses for a living.     For them, Strawn vividly describes all aspects  of the building of an Arthur Hills golf course in Florida.  Strawn is equally good at describing the golf strategy that  goes into the course, the lives of the construction workers,  and the hassles with bureaucrats.     Certainly the best book ever written on the building of a  single golf course. (Ok, it's probably the only book ever   written on this topic, but it's still quite good   in absolute terms).
