This book is just a \\"Pivot Tables for Dummies\\" book at twice the price.  Be warned you will get no code except in the last chapter. The rest of the book is pictures and a beginner's level tutorial on how to use Excel wizards.  This book is more suited for someone in the Marketing Department and should have been appropriately labeled as such.	2004-11-27

It assumes very little and therefore does not get beyond the basics.  The book is slow paced and the author repeats himself often and sometimes in the the same paragraph.  Don't get the wrong impression, I think this book is fine, but it's for the novice who doesn't know how to code at all. The software that comes with the book includes a great editor, ASP.Net Web Matrix.  The other software is SQL Web Server and Framework.  All are avaialble free from Microsoft.  I should add all the examples are written in Visual Basic.	2003-10-04

This is another consultant's attempt at what I learned in my business practice.  The book does not rise above the obvious, but is, for the most part, a survey of ideas.  The best practices discussed have little depth or meat to them.  If you are an executive with planning experience or have read other books on the subject, the read adds very little.	2003-07-18

The book does need some prior knowledge,  I read  it as a refresher and it worked just fine.	1999-08-28

She assumes you know something about Access which is refreshing.  She still goes over basic points but doesn't dwell on them.

Microsoft charges a premium for its books and this is no  exception.  Other Publishers do a better job by giving you more for your  money.

Both the authors and Sams Publishing have come up with a unique approach to teach programming.  Sprinkle the code with bugs and omissions and have the reader fix it.  Not only is the text code bad, but also the accompanying CD-ROM.  I have to admit that after struggling to get the examples to run, I did learn a great deal and am now very confortable with Microsoft's on-line documentation.  The pity is the approach used by the authors is example centric with little explanation as to the details of what was written.  The Editors at Sams Publishing should be ashamed to let this book out.  The magazine, Visual Basic Programmer's Journal, Letters to the Editor section recently discussed the reasons for poor quality technical books.
