It uses short row techniques to make some really pretty garments.  I have made three of the scarves and a belt and they are addictive patterns.  Waiting for yarn to arrive to make a shawl and then might try the vest.  There are also a couple of bags (one felted and one not) that I will eventually do.	2005-09-21

But this Lindsey Davis book is from the Falco series and is fun like all the others.  I frequently buy my Davis books from amazon.co.uk since they come out there about a year before in the US.  There is a new one Scandal Takes a Holiday coming out in June 2004.  They also spell the name Lindsay Davis which I think is the correct spelling.	2004-01-25

In fact they are published in the UK about a year before their US publication so I usually buy from the ... branch.  This novel is different - not Falco.

The experiences of these two young women adjusting to life in the hills of Italy are written in a very entertaining way which keeps your interest.

Well, they were all great but this one is something else.  I have not had to hold in the belly laughs for ages.  I mean when you get older you can read humor without it taking control.  But there are places in this book where there was absolutely no way to keep from an absolute belly laugh.  So I don't recommend this book for a plane unless you want the extra leg room when folks get up and move away from that giggling person who is going to explode from fighting to keep it in.  Whatever you do don't miss it though.  When is the next one?	2001-02-03

Chris Stewart leaves all that he is used to and transforms  himself and his family in the process.  It is very well written and an  excellent account of adjusting to life in rural Spain and also the  transformation of a young couple to a family with the birth of their little  girl and all the changes that can bring.
