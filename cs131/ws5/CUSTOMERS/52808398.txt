This is another overrated book tapping into the wallets of middle America.  I suggest a review of the book firsthand before purchasing.  A more thorough  browse-through will expose the fact that this book is merely a product of a  limited survey done by the authors.  There is nothing new, creative or  innovative suggested by the authors--rather, it is common sense  &quot;how-to&quot;. If I had to recommend this book at all, then it would  be to young readers only, i.e. college or high-school graduates.	1999-09-06

Claire is dealing with her pain, hurt, and feelings of betrayal. The way in which she does so is original and thought provoking.  Has she embarked upon a truly  self-destructive path? Or is she merely exorcising her own inner demons in  order to become a better person? Claire does what a lot of women only  fantasize about doing. She also engages in a process of self-actualization  which many of us are incapable of doing (men and women). Engaging, thought  provoking and entertaining.	1999-07-14

I finished this book in one sitting--could not tear myself away from Wurtzel's stories about her travels into the abyss of depression. Good book for someone who has either experienced depression or needs to gain greater  insight into the nature of depression. However, the title is somewhat  inaccurate considering that Prozac is not even discussed until the last few  chapters--so if the reader is looking for a book about Prozac/or an  individual accounting of the effects of Prozac try another book.  This book  is about Wurtzel herself and her life in dealing with depression.	1999-07-11

I found it boring and was unable to relate to Dedalus at all.  Essentially, this book is a summation of Dedalus' stream of consciousness.  The reader is in Dedalus' mind throughout the entire  book, and he is no charismatic protagonist!  I do understand why it is  ranked as one of the greatest books of the 20th century, but I still hated  it.	1999-07-08

I think this book evokes controversial responses from readers because of the ending and because of their failure to interpret this piece of  literature. Wuthering Heights is not just a love story--it's a story of  relationships, class struggles, the angst of the soul, passion, remorse,  and regret. It is about everything that makes us human, e.g. the power to  choose between good and evil. It is about obsession and how it can kill the  soul.  The story is masterfully written, filled with symbolic  representations. The reader must read between the lines to truly appreciate  and understand this great classic!!	1999-07-05

This, of course, shows that the book is controversial, and oftentimes the most controversial book is the most  interesting to read. I was not disappointed here. Concededly, the author  tends to ramble on and on at times over the same point(s), but this is  truly original and gutsy writing!!  I certainly don't agree with all of the  author's opinions, but I think her ideas are refreshing and insightful.  A  welcome change from the &quot;spiritual&quot; and &quot;new-age&quot;  natures of many books about or for women.	1999-06-23

My first reaction upon reading the first 100 or so pages of this book was that Korda thinks he is really great and wants to tell us all about it!! Korda mocks his readers with his self-congratulatory tone throughout the  entire book. Korda has talent as a writer, but wastes them here in a high  class, status conscious, name-dropping book (who cares if he lived for 2  years as a child in Beverly Hills? Isn't the title &quot;A Memoir of OTHER  People&quot;??). A well-written memoir engages the reader by adding  creative flavor and story-telling to its non-fiction nature. Korda fails to  do that here.	1999-06-16

It was emotionally evocative and captivating, yet I thought at the end that there was still a piece of the story missing. There  lacked closure, and maybe that means that Ms. Fitch will continue the story  of Astrid and her mother, Ingrid, in another book, but still the ending  could have been stronger or breathed a greater sense of finality and  conclusion. Otherwise, the book was refreshing and original, and for me an  emotional experience as well. Very entertaining. Readers will not be  disappointed.	1999-05-28

I bought the hardcover edition of this book when it was first published in early 1996. In combination with a more intensive weight training regimen (prior to that I was &quot;aerobics centered&quot;), I shed that layer of  bodyfat that I'd always had!! I got compliments everywhere I went--at 31 I  was in the BEST shape of my life! My point is that I think this diet is  good, and is not so restrictive as some other low carb-high protein diets  (i.e., like the &quot;Zone&quot; which I do not agree with). But I don't  think substantial and durational body changes can be made without exercise.  This diet will work if you work with it.	1999-05-28

As a woman I cannot sympathize or connect with John Updike's protagonist Harry &quot;Rabbit&quot; Angstrom. However, getting the reader to sympathize with Rabbit is not the goal of Updike.

I guess in that sense it is  extremely user friendly, if anything.  This is, however, the worst book I've ever read on runnning! It's poorly organized and poorly written.   People who don't like to read should buy this book because there is just  not too much to it.  The only useful thing in this book is the author's  list of the &quot;Fastest Marathons in the US&quot;.  In addition, the  author attempts to motivate the reader by instilling the philosophy of,  &quot;If Oprah can do it so can you!&quot; Frankly, I doubt if the average  American would (be able to) hire a personal trainer to train with  exclusively and hold his/her hand through a Marathon.  The author should  re-check his data on Oprah's finishing time for the Marine Corp. Marathon.   In sum, if you hate to read, aren't concerned with details, and only care  about the 'how to' and the 'why', then I DO recommend that you buy this  book.  If you like the more intellectual, mataphysical approach don't buy  it because you will be disappointed.	1999-05-08

I recommend it for those who are seriously interested in  learning everything about running and the details and preparation that go  into training &amp; racing.

Chopin articulated very well a  woman continue in the traditional gender role but at the same time develop  a sense of who she is, i.e. outside of family, outside of husband, outside  of children?  Here, Edna could not and thus the story has a tragic ending  (I should just say suicide since the &quot;utopianpessimist 4/28/99&quot;  let the cat out of the bag already!!!).  I agree with a previous reader  that at first it seemed like a pathetic ending.  On the other hand, one  must look at the context of Edna's situation and the circumstances in her  life.

I think it would have been a better read if Mr.  Douglas had more thoroughly written about, at most, only three of the  predators.  He also could have gone into the lives of the victims/victims'  families more than he did.  He did not bring these people to life at  all--the perps or the victims!!!
