Or, even if you don't like astronomy, but you use terms like \\"light-years apart\\" or \\"dark side of the moon,\\" you'll find the right answers all here. The author has a lucid, humorous writing style that entertains as it teaches. Popular science at its best!	2002-02-27

There are many true-to-life moments in this, such as when Mike takes his daughter to a dance and it's all awkward, and when Sandy and her friend eat chocolate to make themselves feel better. Most of all, it is a love story that gives you  hope that no matter how bad your troubles get, love will find you if you are willing to let it in.	2002-02-06

(HINT: No peeking) Sandra is like someone you would know, with wacky parents and &quot;issues&quot; like you wouldn't believe. Mike Malloy is everyone's hero. Eye candy in a tool belt, but he is also tender, romantic and a great father to his 2 kids, who live with their mother. Highly reccomended.	2002-01-22

The dialogue snaps back and forth between these characters so I found myself reading some of it aloud just to entertain myself. <br />Yet there are layers to this book. Beneath the light, darkness: an unmothered young woman desperate to find her footing in the world (so the deformed foot itself had dual meanings), a guilt-ridden man trying to right a great wrong, a sister who is both more and less than she seems. These are all shadows that make HALFWAY TO HEAVEN all the more fascinating. <br />The setting comes to life until you're just &quot;there&quot; in the White House East room with that dazzling silver Tiffany ceiling, or on a remote spot of Chesapeake Bay just as the fog clears...the time period and setting are meticulously researched but the author's use of them is not &quot;teacher-ish&quot; which is nice. <br />So read for the fun and comedy, but know that this romance will stay with you because of those subtle dark themes.	2001-10-09

I adored THE CHARM SCHOOL, and the others by this author, and now this one is equal to or even fresher and funner than that one.  Abigail is so warm and human and flawed--a girl who has brains and a big heart and is totally unappreciated by Society. Along comes the perfect man who has no idea how perfect he is for her until he finds  himself falling for her no matter how hard he fights his feelings. What a beautiful story, an affirmation of all that is good in the world. And I can't wait to see how the sister turns out. Get this one--it's a great read.	2001-10-02

This author writes with warmhearted humor about REAL people dealing with REAL flaws, just trying to get by. I respect the writer's choice to portray Kate realistically, as a cranky know-it-all career woman, rather than to turn her into a mealy-mouthed &quot;heroine.&quot; Kate strikes me is very true-to-life; maybe that's why some readers seem uncomfortable with this character. The appearance of another man in her life was a great plot point and a way for her to find her way back to Jeff. It made their reconciliation much more believable. He, by the way, is a COMPLETE guy--you can tell the author did her research. Read this book. It's completely charming.	2001-08-22

Thanks to THE WIDOW, I didn't even notice the time passing, the mosquitoes, the sun beating down...I just thought I'd been swept away to a magical villa in Tuscany. The characterizations just sparkle in this one, and I couldn't put the book down as the layers of secrets and lies were slowly  peeled away. Fantastic book, I can't recommend it highly enough.

In THURSDAYS AT EIGHT, Debbie Macomber writes with her trademark humor and heart, but does herself one better for her mainstream hardcover debut. This book is everything you want from a story of women's problems, friendships, lives and loves. The irresistible set-up--4 friends who meet for coffee and talk each Thursday--draws you into the lives of women struggling, striving and growing. This is a brave, honest novel that brilliantly steers clear of sugary sentimentality and instead focuses on real issues, real emotion and yet brings each endearing character full circle on her journey.

The book is smart, sexy, and touching. The reader who  thought the love  scenes were tame just lacks imagination. When  he told her to  leave her  hair long and wear the red high heels...whew!
