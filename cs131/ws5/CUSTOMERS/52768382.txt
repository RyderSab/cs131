Edith's superior observation, style and sharp storytelling kept me going and by the end I understood why I'd loved it so much the first time. Lily is certainly one of the most enigmatic characters you'll ever deal with. She's exasperating, stupid, intelligent, and lovely. Did Edith Wharton realize what a modern story she had written? Lily Bart could be any contemporary beautiful young woman striving to reach the top of her game using whatever tools she can muster. To me, Lily's ultimate sadness is that all her vivaciousness, all that she could be, was swallowed up by a gaping lack of spirit, passed on to her by her mother and her admonition not to \\"be dingey\\". That does a lot for your self esteem.	2005-02-15

Quirky but real, like the conditions of our lives. I missed the lack of dialogue, though, and feel like she walks a thin line between showing and telling. A bit too much telling for my taste, because I was a little distracted worn &amp; out by the end of this journey.	2003-04-14

Rather like trying to see a fantastic painting through an elaborate screen. All you want to do is push it out of the way so you can get a good look at it.	2003-01-28

Dialogue was superb. There is a fine line between showing and telling and it takes some practice for good non-fiction writers or good historical-fiction writers to get it down. In my humble opinion, the reader has a sixth sense about knowing which is which. Chiaventone is learning his craft well.	2002-10-14

His accounts of various historical battles were gripping, but for me his visions, or rather, his nation's reactions to his visions were the most moving part of his story. The Native American's cultural belief in life and after-life as part of the same reality was beautifully manifested in their everyday lives; their belief that visions, dreams and the spirit world, for humans and animals, are all part and parcel of the physical world. These are some of the themes I found most intriguing. It was heartbreaking to me that a man who gave so much of himself, physically and spiritually, to his nation still believed to the end of his life that he failed because he couldn't save it from destruction.	2002-07-30

The weakness is in the actual writing. While some of the dialogue is excellently conceived and written, much of it is mediocre. It is surprising that a writer  of Shaara's advanced experience is still consistently using sophomoric adjectives like &quot;amazing&quot;, &quot;extraordinary&quot; and &quot;wonderful&quot;.

The same relationships exist between the characters, their careers and their women as in Red Grass River. The action passages offer some bright spots (loved the prison break), but they appear between cliche scenes and his desire to show you he's done his homework on all things 1920's (the egg in the radiator, song titles, ginger jake etc.) but what bothers me most is this piece just doesn't seem to have any soul.

His writing here is clean and stirring and knowledgeable as always and because of that I can forgive the passages that, for me, step off into the dry realm of fire science. I can even respect the fire science...he left no stone unturned in his quest to first find out, and then tell the whole story of the Mann Gulch fire. I hope when I am past my biblical allotment of 3 score and some that I am still able to find fresh challenges to share. Especially if sharing is a form of love.	2002-05-08

Really enjoyed the side story of Graziela and thought that struggle between confinement and freedom, religious sacrafice and artistic freedom could be a book all of its own.)

One of the finest writers ever, McCarthy's characters are often done-in, disappointed or die due to their own innate decency.

From the harrowing events surrounding the Central America's sinking in 1857 to the myriad layers of creativity and determination by Tommy Thompson and his  crew 131 years later this is a rich (no pun intended) and evolving story. I  am moved by stories that show how people can work together, against  tremendous odds, to achieve something extraordinary.	1999-02-28

I enjoyed John Wesley's section very much...his bits of wisdom, humor, and twists of his personality. But the Nelse section was like slogging through mud. By the time I got to Naomi I  was exhausted and just couldn't be soothed. Despite its span of time and  characters I found this book very &quot;miniature&quot; which I liked at  first and was later done in by.	1999-02-16

Working, working, working...to enjoy what? Things outside themselves or maybe each unto him  or herself, but certainly not each other.	1998-12-17

I especially loved his descriptions of the sea, clouds, shadow, wind and weather forming amorphous rooms through which he sailed,  physically and emotionally, visually.	1998-11-03

US	52768382	R13TID83MKTTY9	0345404912	665682184	The Last Full Measure: A Novel of the Civil War (Civil War Trilogy)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Deeply Moving	An engaging and moving portrait of war. Shows not only the personalities involved but also the best and worst in man, from the moving &quot;Carry Arms&quot; salute Chamberlain and his men gave the Confederates as they surrendered their weapons, to the inhuman conditions in the trenches. Shaara's love and respect for the men in this extraordinary war shines through.	1998-07-27

Fans themselves of so many great musicians, it's easy to see why Aerosmith enjoys the relationship it has with its multitude of fans. A great read and an even greater story, which still continues to be written.	1998-02-07
