Written with biting humor and supposedly based on the author's school chums, the Georgia Nicolson books capture the lunacy, laughs and just-for-girls-only moments of adolescence: boys and dating, proper makeup application and kissing techniques, and clothes shopping, mostly. Don't be put off by the Young Adult status: these books are wickedly funny and utterly deranged. Consider the following:<br /><br />\\"Rosie went off to her bedroom. She said, \\"I am going to be Massimo, so I have to get in the mood for luuurve.\\" She came back five minutes later wearing a false beard with a banana down her jeans. I said, \\"Why have you got a banana down your jeans?\\" Rosie said, \\"It was Sven's suggestion. He said it is representitative of the pant python.\\" Ellen said, \\"I...er..do you mean like a boy's, er, well...\\" Rosie said, \\"Exactomondo, my little pally.\\"<br /><br />Followed by snogging (kissing) practice:<br /><br />\\"Then Rosie said, \\"Finally, as you haven't had any snogging practice in a while, try an experimental snog on the back of my leg.\\" What??? Absolutely not, not a snowball's chance in hell. No and three times no... Fifteen minutes later: On my knees snogging the back of Rosie's leg whilst the ace gang watch me.\\"<br /><br />In this, the newest novel, Georgia is more philosophical than usual, as her red-bottomosity is out of hand: she is asked out by Italian Vespa-driving hunk Massimo, receives a letter from her ex-Sex God Robbie, currently in New Zealand (or Kiwi-A-GoGo-Land, as G. calls it), and Dave the Laugh seems to think that she's the one and only girl for him. What's a girl to do?<br /><br />She relies on her friends, the Ace Gang (Jas, Jools, Ro Ro, Ellen), to give her guidance in this most trying of times. G. goes as far as flying to Hamburger-a-gogo land (America) in a desperate attempt to find Massimo, complicated by the fact that she thinks Memphis is next to Manhattan. Once back in Billy Shakespeare land (England), Georgia must decide what her heart is trying to tell her. Also along the way, Georgia nearly manages to ruin her feet in too-small shoes while dressed to impress, is involved in a naughty nuddy-pants dance only wearing bison horns, and mangles the French and German languages at will.<br /><br />Includes a handy glossary translating Britishisms and Georgia-isms, and a mini-CD-ROM with screensavers, audio clips from Louise Rennison (the author), and a Mad-Libs type activity.omplicated by the fact that she thinks Memphis is next to Manhattan.

After longing for \\"Mary Engelbreit Cross Stitch for All Seasons,\\" but balking at the high price, I eventually picked up a copy for a song in a bargain bin.  I am a longtime fan of Mary Engelbreit's whimsical work, and copies of several of her more famous works (Everyone needs their own Spot, It's Good to be Queen) grace my home.<br /><br />\\"Cross Stitch For All Seasons\\" includes cross stitch adaptations of Engelbreit's signature works such as Everyone Needs Their Own Spot, Believe, and It's Good to be Queen in a variety of uses: as pillows, basket liners, placemats, bookends, button covers, treat bags and more.<br /><br />The book is arranged in four seasons (Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer), and projects are grouped accordingly.  Halloween treats include a centerpiece, treat bag, candy corn button covers, basket liners and more.  Spring features handy gifts for the gardener.  Baby and wedding projects are also included, along with \\"Breit ideas\\" and a handy section on cross-stitch basics.<br /><br />The patterns are easy to read, both in the choice of colors and in the size of the patterns themselves.  I would classify the stitching level as moderately difficult, and based on the numerous color photos of finished projects that grace the book, the patterns are very close to the originals.  Ranging from quick and easy (button covers) to down and dirty (double-layered, matted wedding plaques), this is sure to please any cross-stitcher who loves the timeless art of Mary Engelbreit.	2005-08-24

I spent three months in the summer of 2005 working in Madrid, and as a longtime fan of Rick Steves' travel show \\"Europe Through the Back Door\\" on PBS, I bought his Spain 2005 guidebook to accompany me on my weekend trips in and around Madrid, as well as on long-distance treks to Santiago de Compostela and Barcelona.<br /><br />The book focuses on destinations such as Madrid, Barcelona, Santiago, Sevilla, Cordoba, Granada and the Costa del Sur, offering a range of dining and lodging options to suit all tastes and budgets.  Rick includes walking tours, hand-drawn maps to locate dining and hotel listings, and a liberal dose of humour and Spanish culture.<br /><br />Nearly all of my reservations on trips were from Rick's recommendations: in Santiago, I stayed at the Hotel Virxe da Cerca (\\"a wonderful splurge\\") and enjoyed a coffee on the terrace of the Hotel Costa Vella, Rick's favourite hotel in Santiago. In Toledo, I tried two different hotels that Rick recommends: the budget-priced, centrally located Hotel Santa Isabel (45 Euros/night for a double) and the plush, tranquil Hostal del Cardenal, a former cardinal's palace built into the ancient city wall.<br /><br />The only hotel recommendation that I found a little off was the Petit Palace Las Torres in Salamanca.  Rick's prices are drastically off for 2005 - although he lists a single room as 67 Euros, the summer rate was 100.  Rick also lists that rooms with a view cost the same as interior rooms; again, this is no longer true.  A room facing the Plaza Mayor runs about 20-30 Euros more a night.  However, the Las Torres is in an unbeatable location, and despite the huge crowds and summer festival in full swing on the Plaza Mayor, there was virtually no outside noise.  Also, the free Internet came in handy.<br /><br />Rick focuses on museums, with handy descriptions and walkthroughs that are lifesavers for non-Spanish speakers, since nearly all museums have little or no English posted, or limited information in general.  His orientation and transportation information is hugely helpful, down to listing metro stops, where to catch buses/trains to specific destinations, and how to go on foot from bus/train stations to downtown areas, saving in costly taxi fares.<br /><br />Also, his listings of vegetarian restaurants were a lifesaver: as a vegan in Spain, vegetarian options are few and far between, and Rick made it easy to navigate.  I especially enjoyed trying the numerous local pastries and delicacies in each town, such as the ponche segoviano (marzipan cake) in Segovia at the Lima y Menta and the pumpkin-filled toledano marzipan cookies at Santo Tome in Toledo.  I wanted to try the crema catalan at the Granja Viader in Barcelona, but even though I arrived before close (as posted by Rick), the shop had already closed.<br /><br />As expected, many of the museum entrance costs have gone up since the book's publication, usually by no more than .50 - 2.00 Euros.  Also, Rick's listed hours for restaurants and museums are not always current; it's best to call using the included telephone numbers to confirm.  Rick's handy guide on reserving hotels, a tapas primer, and included glossary, along with a brief Spanish history, make this an invaluable guide for those who want to experience Spain to the fullest.  Rick steers you away from American-style hotels and restaurants and tourist traps so that you can \\"live like a local,\\" and it's far more authentic (and fun).  For those interested in visiting Gibraltar and Morocco, Rick includes a short, basic guide to Tangier and an extended tour of Morocco.

As a transitioning raw vegan, Howard Lyman's \\"Mad Cowboy\\" struck a powerful chord within me.  I choose to be a raw vegan not only for the obvious health benefits (a low-fat, low-sodium, zero-cholesterol diet rich in antioxidants, nutrients, and fiber can reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer and obesity), but for the moral ones as well: I decided that if I couldn't catch it, kill it, and clean it myself, then I didn't deserve to eat it. As it turns out, that was the wisest choice I could have made.<br /><br />Lyman, a fourth-generation Montana rancher, opens his book with the gruesome process of rendering, in which the blood, bones, offal, and organs of slaughtered animals, euthanized cats and dogs, roadkill and fecal wastes are ground, dried, and added to cosmetics, pet food, and feed for cattle, essentially turning herbivores into carnivorous cannibals. Lyman was a guest on a fateful Oprah show in 1996 when he spoke out about the risk of Mad Cow Disease appearing in America due to the process of feeding rendered downer cows to cattle.  Oprah claimed that she would never eat another hamburger again, and beef stocks plummeted in the millions of dollars.  Oprah and Howard were involved in a lawsuit by Texas cattle ranchers for damages for suffering and slander (later dismissed).<br /><br />Lyman eloquently describes the rich, fertile soil of his family's organic dairy farm when he was a boy, and subsequently chronicles the destruction of the farm, the land, and his health as he uses powerful, toxic pesticides, antibiotics and fertilizers to boost productivity.  Eventually, he is diagnosed with cancer and told that he will never walk again.  Instead, during recovery from the removal of a tumor on his spinal cord, Howard vows to return the farm to its once-pristine state, and in the process becomes politically involved in Washington, D.C.  Still suffering from ill health, Howard became vegan (strict vegetarian), and was amazed at his weight loss, reversal of migraines, and newfound energy.<br /><br />\\"Mad Cowboy\\" is essentially an opera in two acts: the first part of the book explores the toxic, seedy underbelly of factory farming (cattle, poultry, dairy), the lack of effective watchdog organizations (according to Lyman, the FDA is actually involved in perpetrating the cover-ups of research into frequently-used drugs such as Monsanto's carcinogenic rBGH (recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone), which is banned in Canada and the European Union), the draining of precious water and the destruction of vast tracts of land (frequently government- and taxpayer-subsidized) lost to cattle ranching, a detailed timeline of the horrific government denial of Mad Cow Disease in Great Britain (it is estimated that 200,000 Britons could die annually from CJD beginning in 2015 due to the disease's long incubation period), and the potential for a similar tragedy unfolding in the United States due to insufficient inspections of downer cows and the continued feeding of blood and bonemeal to cattle.<br /><br />The last section clearly and logically explains why human beings are not carnivores by nature.  Evolution has created carnivores with a short digestive system to facilitate the speedy removal of decaying flesh.  Carnivores also have acidic saliva, and do not possess molars for grinding their food, or ptyalin for predigesting grain, which humans have. Humans have a digestive system that is twelve times the length of their body, and stomach acid that is only 5% as acidic as that of a true carnivore.  \\"Do we have blood lust? Well, does the idea of tearing a chicken or cow apart with your hands and teeth and sucking its warm blood appeal to you? People eat their meat packaged and disguised precisely because of the reality of eating flesh disgusts most of us. Maybe there's a reason for that.\\" Well said, Howard.<br /><br />This book is not for the faint of heart (or stomach!), but for those who seek the truth about the old adage \\"you are what you eat,\\" this book will open your eyes to the dangers of ingesting animal flesh and byproducts and the toxic hormones, chemicals and unwanted byproducts such as saturated fat and cholesterol that come with the territory.

Milly has managed to successfully keep this info from her best friend Em, friends Jake and Dylan, and the community at large, because thinking about her sickly beginnings at an orphanage dredged up too many painful questions about why she was abandoned at the doorstep, who her birth parents may have been and if they \\"disappeared\\" during the dictatorship.<br /><br />Milly is forced to confront her past when Pablo Bol&iacute;var joins her grade at high school. Pablo and his parents are refugees from Milly's home country (which is never named).  One of his uncles was murdered, one of his brothers is a prisoner, and the other a revolutionary. Pablo asks Milly to help him with English in exchange for practicing Spanish, and one day makes a comment that changes Milly's life: he tells her that her eyes look like those of the mountain village Los Luceros.  Also, Milly overhears an angry family discussion in which her unhappy grandmother Happy effectively writes her out of her will as she is not a \\"blood\\" relation.<br /><br />Milly begins to slowly examine her feelings by confronting \\"The Box,\\" a mahogany box containing her adoption papers, naturalization papers, two locks of hair (one light, one dark), a coin, and several photos, and in a brave speech running for a class office, tells the story of her adoption to the school at large. The second half of the novel chronicles Milly's journey to her homeland. When Milly's home country is freed from tyranny and democracy is slowly put into place, she takes up Mrs. Bol&iacute;var's invitation to visit, searching for traces of her shadowy past. Milly and Paco become more than just friends, bonded by the shared sadness of having lost loved ones in the war.<br /><br />The novel does not have a \\"fairy tale\\" ending where everything works out perfectly, but the ending provided a satisfying conclusion to Milly's journey.

Like author Terry Gamble (of Proctor and Gamble lineage), I've spent nearly every summer of my life in and around Harbor Springs, Michigan, a small Northern Michigan resort community on the Little Traverse Bay. Gamble has drawn from her childhood memories spent on Harbor Point to create the lush settings for Water Dancers, using thinly veiled pseudonyms for Harbor Point (Beck's Point), Harbor Springs (Moss Village), Petoskey (Chibawasee), and Cross Village (Horseshoe Lake).<br />The novel's protagonist, Rachael Winnapee, is a sixteen-year old Odawa orphan from Horseshoe Lake who, since the death of her grandmother, has lived at the Indian School in Moss Village (the actual school is alongside the Holy Childhood of Jesus Catholic Church in Harbor Springs), and like many First Nations orphans, is sent to be a domestic at Beck's Point.<br />The novel begins in 1945. Rachael ends up serving the March family from St. Louis. The March's sons are both overseas fighting, Lip in Belgium and Woody in the Pacific Theater. When Lip is killed in battle and Woody comes home an amputee and morphine addict, it is up to Rachel to help make Woody whole. The two begin a brief, intense love affair, sealed with seashells, hidden gifts, lovemaking in dunes, shallows and empty rooms, and finally, Rachael's unwanted pregnancy.<br />Rachel raises her son Ben on her own, continuing to live with the midwives who delivered her child. After nine years of helping out on their farm, Rachel moves back to Horseshoe Lake with Ben. The novel fast forwards to Ben's experiences fighting in Vietnam and his difficult readjustment to civilian life, and culminates in an unexpected and explosive conclusion in which the past is confronted and old ghosts laid to rest.<br />Water Dancers is a multifaceted novel of healing (three of the main characters are veterans), of class and race, duty, discovering inner strength, and seeking peace. The characters are poetically and lovingly crafted, down to the most minor details. Terry Gamble's first novel deliciously brings to life the many moods of water and forest that dominate life in Northern Michigan, and for those who are familiar with Northern Michigan, like Rachael's habit of licking stones, this novel will bring you home.or details.

Her artist father went off to war and never came home, leaving Leyla and her brother Cengiz to find food and keep their mother and twin brothers afloat in a time of poverty. Leyla'a special skill is working with flowers, particularly tulips, which she cultivates. One day four foreign men come offering money for girls to be married, and Leyla chooses to go with them, leaving the coins for her family.<br />She soon discovers that the group of girls she is travelling with are not to be married, but to be sold as slaves. Leyla befriends five-year old Lena and acts as an older sister to her, but the two are split up in Istanbul, where they are sold to the highest bidder. Leyla ends up in the harem at Topkapi Palace as a gardening apprentice and quickly learns the rules and manners of the court, and through hard work and new friendships she realizes her dream of painting, growing tulips and being reunited with her family once more.<br />\\"Leyla\\" is full of intriguing descriptions of the opulent palaces and gardens of Istanbul, life in the Georgian countryside, some of the basic tenets of Islam, gardening, and harem life. There are many Turkish/Arabic words scattered throughout, and a handy glossary at the back, along with a segment on girls' life in Turkey today.

Ireland is in the midst of another Depression, and Kathleen's father is out of work. After showing up to her (Catholic) school late one too many times, one of the sisters recommends Irish dance lessons as a way to keep Kathleen out of trouble. Kathleen finds from the very first lesson that she loves to dance and has a real talent for it, but the issue of not being able to pay for classes nearly ends her career at the beginning.<br />She is chosen to represent her dance school at a feis (dance competition), but is haunted by her mother's severe illness and her lack of money for a dance costume (a requirement to participate). Her favourite Aunt Polly grows distant as well, and Kathleen prays for a miracle. Her miracle does indeed come, but not in a way anyone expected!<br />\\"Kathleen: The Celtic Knot\\" is a fabulous read, very Irish in character (each novel is written by someone from the country it takes place in) and similar at times to Irish novelist Frank McCourt's voice. Many Irish expressions and Gaelic words are sprinkled liberally in the text. The back of the book features a segment on life in Ireland and a glossary of Irish/Gaelic words and expressions.

I am a huge fan of YA historical fiction, especially international historical fiction. Having lived in the lands that Isabel once ruled (Castilla y Le&oacute;n), the novel was a pleasant reminder of the many castles, monasteries and medieval buildings I visited while living in northern Spain (Burgos). When I attended the Universidad de Burgos I took Spanish history as a requirement, and we learned about many of the events covered in this novel: the Moorish conquest in 711, the centuries of the Reconquista (the attempt to retake Spain and drive out the infidels), the final victory at Granada in January 1492, the later expulsion of Jews and Moors that year, and most fateful, Cristob&aacute;l Colon's discovery of America, as well as the political intrigue surrounding Alfonso and Enrique, Juana La Beltraneja, and later Juana La Loca.<br />Isabel strives to follow the instruction of her confessor (later the head of the brutal Spanish Inquisition) Tom&aacute;s de Torquemada, but is spirited, not content with the answers she is given. With her father dead and her mother having lost her senses, Isabel is left to fend for herself and to follow her heart.<br />Isabel's diary reads like exactly that: a diary, with long stretches of time glossed over, full of the tedious details that filled her confined life until her marriage. The extended cast of characters numbers near forty, and at times the book feels like a memory exercise. However, the author makes a brave attempt to bring to life a lost period of time when Spain was divided between Christian and Moor, and the Christian provinces were dangerous, full of outlaws and warring factions, each ruled by a separate king. Isabel's life is constantly at risk, caught in a war between her brothers, and it is her marriage to Fernando of Arag&oacute;n that finally produces the beginnings of a unified Espa&ntilde;a.<br />Although some information is inaccurate, \\"Isabel: Jewel of Castilla\\" is full of historical details about life in Spain, the political climate of the time, popular beliefs, court life and more, and various Spanish names/phrases are used (there is a handy glossary in the back). There is an abridged family tree, photocopies of maps, engravings and statues, and a list of characters provided at the end of the book.the time, popular beliefs, court life and more, and various Spanish names/phrases are used (there is a handy glossary in the back).

The first half of the book is more or less the continual struggle to update the villa and maintain the lands while Mayes and her significant other Ed (Mayes was divorced shortly before settling in Italy) jet between teaching in San Francisco and Italy in the summers.<br />The novel is ripe with descriptions of village life that brought to mind my four months in Spain: the after-dinner strolls and coffees, children playing in the plazas and splashing in fountains, the wonder of touring ruins (in Mayes' case, Etruscan, in my case Roman and Visigoth), the twisting, precarious village streets and rabbit warren of medieval buildings, the colourful spectacle of village markets and specialty shops, and the fresh, simple, yet delicious regional cuisine.<br />The sun permeates the novel: Mayes basks in its rays, somehow intensified and made more magical in Tuscany. Mayes frequently queues to parallels of her growing up in the South, of the memories of food and comfort that shaped her. Neglected olive trees and fruit trees thrive under her care. The garden is slowly reclaimed, and the house at long last becomes a home. The run-down Bramasole (\\"yearning for the sun\\") villa begins a new life as Frances and Ed reclaim it, invite family and friends to stay, and even host a wedding. Most outstanding of all are Mayes' descriptions of the luscious foods: fresh fruits so ripe that they have spoiled by the next day, the delicate pairing of prosciutto and fig, the profusion of excellent table and dessert wines from nearby towns, the simple peasant dishes that have become a mainstay of Tuscan cooking.<br />Besides the delicious sets of seasonal recipes, Mayes is at times poetic and introspective about our origins: who were the mysterious and little-known Etruscans really? How much can we tell from stone tableaus that only capture a moment in time and tell only a little of the spirit of the civilization that created them? What is our place in the grand scheme of things? Although I enjoyed her delves into the past, they frequently jarred me out of the dreamlike state that her descriptive prose had put me in. I especially found that the end of the novel really seemed out of place for me, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. If you've seen the movie but haven't read the book, bear in mind that the movie is a Hollywood concoction, a fairy tale of an idealistic life in Tuscany, and although the protagonist (a luminous Diane Lane) may share the same name as the author, the book is a much more accurate portrait of Frances Mayes, although the movie is beautiful (filmed on location in Cortona and Positano) and has its own merits.

If you've seen the movie but haven't read the book, bear in mind that the movie is a Hollywood concoction, a fairy tale of an idealistic life in Tuscany, and although the protagonist (a luminous Diane Lane) may share the same name as the author, the book is a much more accurate portrait of Frances Mayes, although the movie is beautiful (filmed on location in Cortona and Positano) and has its own merits. If you're a fan of travel writing, good food and wine, and adventure abroad, then \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" is for you.	2003-11-17

Brennan, like author Kathy Reichs, is a forensic anthropologist who works between North Carolina and the province of Qu&eacute;bec identifying causes of death and IDs remains too badly mangled or maimed for local experts (including the occasional animal).<br />  In \\"Bare Bones\\" we find Tempe back from her expedition in Guatemala (the setting of her last novel \\"Grave Secrets\\") about to go on a much-needed and long-anticipated beach vacation with detective Andrew Ryan, a colleague from Montr&eacute;al. However, a series of ominous events derails her leisure time: a newborn's charred remains found in a crack house, a downed drug plane, a cache of bear (and human) bones on a farm, and missing federal agents draw Tempe into another sinister web of deception, danger and death. A mysterious stalker, the Grim Reaper, threatens all that Tempe loves by leaving chilling snapshots as seen through the scope of a high-powered rifle. What has Tempe stumbled onto?<br />This time around (and much to my consternation), Tempe spends no time in my beloved Qu&eacute;bec. That was one of the draws that I loved so much in \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead:\\" the vivid descriptions of \\"La Belle Province,\\" the descriptions of local Montr&eacute;al hangouts and restaurants, the charming qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois touches, all set Kathy Reichs apart. In \\"Bare Bones,\\" however, Reichs grounds Tempe in the South. I loved the research about Melungeons (a subject of great interest to me).  Melungeons (meaning \\"cursed\\" or \\"lost soul\\") live in the Appalachians and are believed to be descendants of Portuguese sailors, Roanoke survivors, First Nations, and possibly Turkish slaves among others), but overall the book seemed to cover less new ground than past outings. Similarly, the three plots are much less loosely connected than in previous novels. The budding romance between Tempe and Ryan was very deftly and gently carried out, although Ryan is not actually present for most of the novel. Tempe's Green Party rants at the end of the book seemed incongruous, more a political statement than in character for Tempe, but overall \\"Bare Bones\\" is another enjoyable read from Reichs. I only hope the next novel is set in Qu&eacute;bec once more.mpe and Ryan was very deftly and gently carried out, although Ryan is not actually present for most of the novel.

I remember seeing Kathy Reichs' \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead\\" a number of years ago, but after reading this fabulous book, I'm angry at myself for not picking it up sooner! \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead\\" is a bit like \\"CSI\\" meets Montr&eacute;al: a match made in heaven if ever I've seen one. Reichs' voice at once rings true: like her protagonist Temperance Brennan, Reichs herself is a forensic anthropologist for North Carolina and the province of Qu&eacute;bec.<br />\\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Dead\\" blends the fascinating world of forensic pathology with the vibrant scene that is Montr&eacute;al, the largest French-speaking city outside of Paris. Reichs throws in colourful joual, perfectly captures a number of different Qu&eacute;bec accents, and brings a fantastic vision of Montr&eacute;al to the page as well as intimately involving the reader on a quest to identify the five bodies left behind by a brutal serial killer. Reichs' in-depth details are NOT for the overly squeamish: \\"The limbs retained large portions of putrefied soft tissue. Maggots were dropping from the body to the table, from the table to the floor, in a slow but steady drizzle.\\"  Consider yourself warned.<br />This is an amazingly satisfying debut that left me craving more, mainly because the book brought back so many memories of La Belle Province, Qu&eacute;bec, that I've called home. The descriptions of the various processes that Tempe and her colleagues use to identify the mutilated remains and track the killer never seemed forced or out of place. At times the book crawls to a standstill as Reichs becomes a little too enthusiastic about certain forensic procedures that could have been pared down (like a chapter dealing with the intricacies of bone saws in technical jargon that seemed to go on forever), and clich&eacute;d lingo, with loads of great, sometimes cheesy metaphors, but Tempe Brennan and her deliciously eccentric friends and colleagues seem wonderfully three-dimensional, always human with their own flaws and fears. The book is peppered with French and Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois phrases, explanations and neighbourhood desriptions, and at times it felt a bit like a travelogue as Tempe would describe her favourite area restaurants and various haunts.<br />If you enjoy mysteries, forensics, \\"CSI,\\" or Montr&eacute;al, this book is for you. Be warned that there is a good deal of death, autopsies, mutilation, and violence towards animals and women. If that bothers you then you'll want to look elsewhere, but for the rest of us Tempe and Kathy bring us a fascinating world of postmortems, the vibrant metropolis that is Montr&eacute;al, and the hunt for a vicious killer that takes on a personal side for Tempe as her daughter, best friend, and Tempe herself are all in danger.

I love the fabbity fab \\"Georgia Nicolson\\" series by Lousie Rennison. Quirky and refreshing, the books are a \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" for the early teens set and follow the adventures of Georgia on her adventures at her London school, on dates, family vacations, and in this instalment to Paris with Gorgey Henri. But maybe I've grown out of the series, because for some reason I didn't find \\"Nuddypants\\" as funny or riveting as the previous books. I'd waited for at least a year to read this, and was totally thrilled when I got my hands on a copy.<br />But I found myself frequently distracted by many of the now-familiar antics, which haven't changed much since the last three books. Although there were some funny moments, the plot felt tired, with many of Georgia's favourite sayings and situations overused. Georgia's trip to Paris was a highlight for me, but overall I'm almost glad that this is the last book in the series. The first three were hilarious, off-the-wall stories of friendship, wacky adventures and crazy family antics, but \\"Nuddypants\\" finds Georgia obsessing between two love interests and a lot less...being Georgia. Pity.<br />Diehard Georgia fans will want to have a go at Nuddypants, but for all of you Georgia newbies out there, do yourselves a favour and start with book one, Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging, to get a real taste of the insanity Georgia calls life.<br />(Hint: it makes much more sense to read the first three books in order before attempting this one since there are numerous inside references to past events.)	2003-04-07

Let it be known: I am a train nut. A VIA Rail nut, to be more specific. So when I heard about this great little mystery about a murder aboard the Canadian from Winnipeg to Vancouver, I had to read it! \\"Murder on the Canadian\\" was a short read, but a very enjoyable one.<br />Protagonist Tom Austen wants to become a detective like his idols the Hardy Boys. Tom knows all the techniques: fingerprinting, poisons, collecting evidence and interrogating suspects, but when his vacation turns to a real murder investigation he gets more than he bargained for.<br />The beautiful Catherine Saks has been murdered in her room, apparently by her drunk, jealous husband. There are a number of suspects, and Tom has to move quickly and carefully to avoid being caught. The case takes a number of interesting twists and turns, including Tom nearly being abandoned in a small town, a poisoned omelette, and a fight in a railway tunnel with the killer.<br />Vivid descriptions, steady pacing and plenty of great conversations, as well as several action-packed sequences make this an enjoyable read for mystery and train fans of all ages.	2003-04-06

Each chapter covers a specific period in Spanish history, along with notes on art, architecture, music, literature for each time period. I found the level of Spanish to be very easy, although it might prove a bit challenging to second or third year Spanish students. The look of the book is a bit outdated (colour photos would have been nice for the art photos!), and the \\"history\\" ends at 1996 or so. Overall, a worthy investment, complete with maps, a timeline, a glossary, and plenty of useful, compact information about the most important events and people in Spain throughout the ages.	2003-01-30

Kaleidoscopic in nature, various events of Rudolph Nureyev's life are told by family members, teachers, dance partners, and friends, and this constantly changing perspective helps keep the novel's momentum.<br />\\"Dancer\\" begins in grim postwar Russia with the arrival of wounded soldiers, and young Rudolph wonders if his father will be arriving with them. He dances for the soldiers in the makeshift hospital, and eventually studies dance with an exiled former ballerina. Later he goes to Leningrad to continue his training, living with Yulia, a repressed translator trapped in an abusive, dead-end marriage. Rudolph is blossoming into adulthood, arrogant and mysterious, and it becomes clear to all that he will become a legend of ballet. To the shock of family and friends, he defects from the Soviet Union even as his fame grows, but secret agents continue to hound him, waiting for him to trip up so he can be sent to the hard labour camps or even sentenced to death. The rest of the novel chronicles his stormy love affair with Erik Bruhn, his journeys between London and Paris, his later friendship with gay hustler Victor Pareci and the downward spiral of drugs, unsafe sex, dance injuries, a risky return to the Soviet Union, and hints of his losing battle against AIDS.<br />The numerous narrators include Odile, Nureyev's French maid, Margot Fonteyn, Victor Pareci, a London shoemaker, Rudolph's sister Tamara, Yulia, and others. Somehow McCann manages to keep the individual threads of the story separate, yet interwoven enough to form a shimmering tapestry of passion, betrayal, dedication, and above all the dance itself, spanning four decades of Nureyev's life and his final return to visit his ailing mother and friends. Touching and vibrant, \\"Dancer\\" is a whirlwind ride into the mind and body of an exiled ballet genius who will never be forgotten.	2003-01-24

I first heard about \\"How To Be A Canadian\\" on CBC's \\"Basic Black,\\" in which Arthur Black interviewed the Ferguson brothers (Will and Ian) and they read some of the best parts of the book out loud. What can I say...I was hooked and rushed out to buy a copy at Chapters (Amazon.ca didn't exist then...sorry guys, I'm now a loyal Amazon.ca customer!). \\"HTBAC\\" reads fairly quickly, but it is an immensely enjoyable read, and explosively funny in spots (don't read this at work if you don't want coworkers giving you looks of sympathy after your random hyena laughter).<br />\\"How To Be A Canadian\\" conveniently packages our national heroes, cuisine, regional differences, literary endeavours, phobias, and odd social customs into a laugh-out-loud tome that is the literary equivalent of Timbits: tasty, bite-sized chapters on \\"Who To Hate and Why,\\" \\"How To Waste Time Like A Canadian,\\" \\"Mating Rituals,\\" \\"Art and Stuff,\\" \\"Progressive Conservatives, Responsible Government and Other Oxymorons,\\" and \\"Twelve Ways To Say You're Sorry,\\" along with how to insult Canadians, the official Canadian haircut and dress code (mullet, plaid shirt, skidoo boots with fake buckles), provincial \\"fact sheets\\" (Ontario: \\"Gaze Upon our Humble Magnificence and Bow Down Before Us!\\" Formal name: The Centre of the Universe. Provincial motto: \\"Celebrating over 100 years of narcissistic self-absorption\\") and more. To top it off the Ferguson brothers have written a clever little quiz at the end to test your Canadian knowledge (If you hear the name \\"Elvis\\" and immediately think of figure skating, give yourself one point. If you still don't know what the capital of New Brunswick is, give yourself 10 points. If you can't remember if you curled or not, because of how drunk you were: 50 points) You get the idea. Nothing is sacred for Will and Ian, which is what makes the book so funny.<br />So, if you're American and want to learn more about those mysterious neighbo(u)rs of yours to the north, this is the book for you. If you're a Canadian who needs a quick reply to \\"What makes a Canadian\\" (other than *not* being an American), this book is for you. I have bought \\"How to Be A Canadian\\" for a number of friends with different tastes and it's been a success all around.

I bought this book after my visit to the Alhambra, and found it to be a fantastic companion to what I had seen and experienced.<br />The Alhambra (and Generalife) is a combination fort/palace/gardens dating from the 13th century, filled with fantastic Arabic architecture (ornate plasterwork, ceramic tiles, sculpted marble fountains and archways), and lots of room for imagining the days of its former greatness, which Irving brings to life most memorably. The book is illustrated with charming and detailed watercolour engravings dating from the same period when the book was written.<br />Irving seamlessly winds legend, history, and a Spanish travelogue of sorts together, and even though the book is over 170 years old, it seems as if it was written yesterday. There are tales of princes, genies, lost and found loves, enchanted treasures, battles, hellish headless horses (does the inspiration seem familiar?), and commentary on the Spanish landscape and nature of the Spaniards that he lives with. Full of bewitching music, the smell of roses and exotic perfumes, firey sunsets, and the ghosts of the past, the book is a sensory treat as well. If you plan on visiting the Alhambra, read this first--it will definitely enhance your experience. If you've already visited, this makes a priceless souvenir, bringing to life once more the stately halls and fragrant gardens.	2002-10-17

As someone who will be spending a bit of time in northern Spain (four months), the Eyewitness Guide has proved invaluable on excursions to nearby cities (including Madrid). Since Spain is full of thousands of monuments, churches and cathedrals, bullrings (for those who, like me, oppose the inherent cruelty of bullfights and animal abuse in Spain, one can always appreciate the architecture of famous bullrings), museums, palaces, monasteries and other places of interest, the Eyewitness Guide gives you the best of the best, with brief synopses, maps and must-sees in museums, street maps, photos, historical backgrounds and more.<br />I especially appreciated the features for each region, such as wildlife, wines, and regional food specialties. I plan to visit many different cities and regions while I am in Spain, and now I have ideas on what I want to spend my time on. There is also a handy survival guide including phoning in Spain, police, shopping suggestions, size charts for clothing and shoes and monetary conversions between Euros and pesetas.<br />I found this book most useful in conjunction with the \\"Let's Go: Spain, Portugal and Morocco\\" guide that was given to me by a friend before I left. My only grudge with the Eyewitness guide is its lack of lodging information--there are few hotels (and no hostels) listed, even though there are upwards of twenty in my town (Burgos). The \\"Let's Go\\" guide is more useful for (cheap) lodging information, and the hostel I stayed at in Madrid (Hostal Aguilar, Calle San Jeronimo 32, second floor) was an unbeatable bargain, as well as spotlessly clean with a private bath and centrally located. If I had used the Eyewitness guide I would have easily spent much more. Also, there are no maps for smaller cities, something which the \\"Let's Go\\" guide provides. But finding maps in Spanish towns is generally not difficult as there are tourism offices in nearly every town that provide maps free of charge.<br />Overall, the Eyewitness guide is well worth the price, and the colourful photos, excellent research and interesting side notes make exploring Spain a pleasure.

I was not familiar with Margaret George's previous biographies, but I was immediately impressed with her ease of storytelling and the depth of her research. Although not groundbreaking, \\"Mary, Called Magdalene\\" is an enjoyable read.<br />George sticks to safe ground, not really radically reinventing much of the familiar story of Jesus and his disciples, but some episodes raise red flags: Mary travels with and sleeps next to men (including Jesus), something that no respectable Jewish woman of her time would have done. Also, during her possession, Mary conceives by a pagan goddess after turning her back on God, then wavering between the pull of the pagan goddess and God, yet later she becomes a pillar of the Church? The characters and dialogue are memorable and generally well developed, and George manages to make familiar material (the Gospels and the story of Mary Magdalene) fresh and raise some interesting questions.	2002-07-14

The novel begins in the present, with a German math teacher confiding to a colleague about his father's stolen Vermeer, dubbed \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue.\\" The rest of the novel is a series of short stories that trace the lineage of the painting: the Jewish family in Antwerp that Otto Engelbrecht (the father of Cornelius, the math teacher) had stolen the painting from, an adulterous Frenchwoman in exile, a husband remembering his first love, a Dutch family in 1717 that rescued an infant in a flood, the father of the infant, and finally Vermeer's inspiration for the painting.<br />Full of lush details that bring the various historical eras into sharp focus, Vreeland's descriptions paint the fictitious \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" not only as a remarkable painting (\\"certain brush strokes subtly changed their tint,\\" \\"the russet of the girl's skirt glistened like maple leaves in autumn sun,\\" \\"creamy yellow light the colour of the inner petals of jonquils illuminated the girl's face and reflected points of light on her shiny fingernails,\\" \\"the blue in the girl's smock, which hung in graceful folds of that luscious deep blue of the early hyacinths when the blooms are just beginning to open\\"), but as a captivating presence in the lives of its owners.

In the &quot;Sarah McLachlan Collection&quot; songbook (vocal/piano/guitar), there are illustrations drawn by Sarah, hand-penned lyrics and a centrefold of concert photos that makes this a feast for the eyes as well as the ears. &quot;Collection&quot; covers Sarah's first three studio albums: Touch (&quot;Vox,&quot; &quot;Ben's Song,&quot;), Solace (&quot;Drawn To The Rhythm,&quot; &quot;I Will Not Forget You,&quot; &quot;Lost,&quot;) and Fumbling Towards Ecstasy (the title of which was taken from Wilfred Owen's poem &quot;Dulce et Decorum est&quot; that features the line &quot;An ecstasy of fumbling&quot;) (&quot;Possession,&quot; &quot;Path of Thorns,&quot; &quot;Wait,&quot; &quot;Plenty,&quot; &quot;Good Enough,&quot; &quot;Fear,&quot; &quot;Circle,&quot; &quot;Ice,&quot; &quot;Ice Cream,&quot; &quot;Hold On,&quot; and &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;).<br />The arrangements are greatly simplified, especially &quot;Possession.&quot; It should be noted that this is *NOT* the piano version of &quot;Possession&quot; that was a hidden track on &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; (and also featured on the &quot;Due South&quot; soundtrack). This transcription is from the album version, and it is very, very basic. You will want to add your own embellishments to make it workable.<br />However, most of the songs closely resemble their album counterparts and are a joy to play. I love the shimmery buoyancy of &quot;Vox,&quot; the Loreena McKennitt-like musings of &quot;Drawn To the Rhythm,&quot; and the high-strung melancholy of &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.&quot; This is a wonderful addition to any fan's Sarah McLachlan collection.<br />(Note: there is a section devoted to guitar tabs for all of you guitarists out there)	2002-04-22

I own both of Sarah McLachlan's piano songbooks (&quot;Sarah McLachlan Collection&quot; and &quot;Surfacing&quot;) and this is my favourite of the two. I've been playing piano for fourteen years and I've been a fan of Sarah for just as long. &quot;Surfacing&quot; features piano transcriptions that sound almost exactly like the CD. &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; captures the shimmering guitar intro and saucy feel, &quot;I Love You&quot; is a haunting piano solo that trails off into silence, &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; was my least favourite....that haunting guitar intro just didn't cross over to piano as well. &quot;Adia&quot; sounds just like the recording, as does &quot;Angel,&quot; and &quot;Last Dance&quot; performs beautifully (a musical saw played the melody on &quot;Surfacing&quot;). &quot;Full of Grace&quot; was featured on the &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; soundtrack a number of years back and is very delicate; &quot;Witness&quot; becomes a powerful song on piano with its striking, rhythmic bass chords that underscore the melody. &quot;Black and White&quot; was another song that I routinely skip over--somehow the piano just doesn't do it justice. This is the best transcription of popular music that I've ever had the pleasure to play--it is at times haunting, assertive, lovesick and playful. If you are a Sarah McLachlan fan you'll also want to check out the &quot;Sarah McLachlan Songbook&quot; that features songs from &quot;Touch&quot; and &quot;Solace&quot; along with &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy.&quot;	2002-04-22

Turned into a lion, he is told that his father will kill him the next day, and that the only thing that can break the curse is the love of a woman. He flees his palaces and gardens, journeying to India and eventually to France.<br />The rest of the tale follows the original fairytale closely, taking place in the French countryside, with gardens full of roses. But the thing that makes Napoli's version so different and such a delight is her ability to describe the exotic sights, sounds, colours, smells and tastes of Persia, the numerous Arabic and Farsi words sprinkled throughout the text, quotes from Sufi mystics and the Quaran, and Orasmyn's observations on the countries he travels through and life as a lion. This is my favourite retelling of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" along with Robin McKinley's version.	2002-04-17

I picked up \\"Basket Case\\" after reading about it on Amazon.com and I wasn't disappointed! I finished it over the weekend and look forward to reading more of Carl Hiaasen's works.<br />\\"Basket Case\\" combines the gritty world of rock and roll and the recording industry with a pinch of romance, whodunit and death...lots o' death. Our leading man Jack Tagger writes obituaries and is obsessed with death, going as far as memorizing what celebrities died at what age, then seeing if he will outlive them.<br />At times \\"Basket Case\\" requires suspension of reality, but there are many enjoyable moments (the dead lizard in the freezer being one of them) as Jack searches for the truth about the death of Jimmy Stoma, lead singer of Jimmy and the Slut Puppies. Hiaasen obviously has a handle on modern pop culture as he drops current band names and trends every few pages and doesn't miss a beat. Carl introduces us to the newsroom, ravers, Ecstasy, photo shop girls who make secret duplicates of naughty amateur photos, industry scumbags with L'Oreal hair and thug bodyguards, a Courtney Lovesque widow bent on building her career at the expense of her deceased husband.<br />The plot moves along at a steady pace, and Hiaasen includes enough twists and turns to make things interesting every few chapters. Being a musician, I enjoyed the musical descriptions and aspects of the book. Lots of memorable characters and moments.	2002-03-12

She is the youngest violinist there, and spends the summer practicing Mozart's fourth violin concerto. Along the way she learns a great deal about the importance of remembering, friendships, and understanding the music inside all of us.<br />\\"The Mozart Season\\" is my favourite YA book dealing with music--Euwer Wolff fills the pages with sparkling cadenzas, trills and double stops, Miles Davis jazz records, and a midnight radio serenade. Allegra's reactions and insights into Mozart's compositions helped me to better interpret them myself.<br />There is a memorable cast of characters as well: besides Allegra there is Bro David, her older cartoonist brother, Deidre, the strange semi-famous soprano who throws up before going on stage and breaks down easily at the smallest things, Mr. Trouble, a brain-damaged man looking for his lost song, and more.<br />The book is full of detail: the smell and colour of the roses in the park, the sound of water splashing down a metal sculpture, the pianissimo notes floating softly through the air, the feel of the embroidered velvet purse that belonged to Allegra's great-grandmother, the smells from the food vendors at the concerts. This is the most descriptive (and aural) book that I have ever read; from page one you will be drawn into Allegra's \\"Mozart Summer\\" wishing that it would never end.	2002-03-12

Ferguson takes the reader on a memorable journey from the southernmost point on the island of Kyushu (Cape Sata) to Cape Sooya on the northernmost island of Hokkaido, home to the Canadian World amusement park. I kid you not. This is another example of perplexing Japanese behaviour. Canadian World is a theme park that recreates Avonlea on PEI and has Canadian guides greet visitors and teach them Canadian crafts. I'll be sure to visit when I'm homesick for Canada. Right.<br />Ferguson is hilarious at times when telling Japanese about Canada: &quot;In Ka-Na-Da everyone lives in peace and harmony. It sure is great being a Canadian. You get to share all the material benefits of living next door to the United States, yet at the same time you get to act smug and haughty and morally superior. You just can't beat that kind of irresponsibility.&quot;<br />&quot;Hokkaido Highway Blues&quot; is as much a reflection of being Canadian as it is about Japan.<br />Ferguson nails cultural attitudes, the art of Japanese conversation, spreads out dishes of miso, unagi, tako, tonkatsu, and other delicacies for us to sample, shows us the many shades of green, rocky shores, and Shinto shrines, and makes us love his vision of Japan. His humour, honesty, and excellent storytelling abilities make this a true treasure for anyone interested in Japan (JET teachers should be required to read this before they go!), the exhilaration of hitchhiking into the unknown, and making do in a foreign environment.apan (JET teachers should be required to read this before they go!), the exhilaration of hitchhiking into the unknown, and making do in a foreign environment.	2002-01-19

One of my literati friends gave this to me for my birthday last year as a joke since I always talk about writing more but I always manage to procrastinate. Joel Saltzman's &quot;If You Can Talk You Can Write&quot; was both funny and insightful and helped me kick some of my bad writing habits (being too much of a perfectionist during early drafts, beating writer's block, revising). After I read it I sat down the next day and followed Joel's advice: write about whatever, as long as I was writing again. This is like writer therapy (or rehabiliation). It got me off my chesterfield and back at the keyboard.<br />This is a great tool for student writers and university writing courses. If I ever decide to teach creative writing, this book will definitely be on my required reading list. Too many writers burn out from many of the topics Joel discusses, such as being too critical, too much of a perfectionist, or labouring away trying to imitate the style of the classic writers instead of finiding your own unique voice.	2002-01-15

As a kid I loved sitting around reading these, sometimes by myself tucked away in a dark, musty corner, or better yet, on Halloween with friends. OK, so the stories weren't really all that scary, but they are a lot of fun. The illustrations are morbid and occasionally gruesome, and really lend to the atmosphere of &quot;terror.&quot; There are tons of other, scarier books on the market, sure, but these are a lot of fun for parents and kids alike. No murdered cheerleaders &agrave; la R.L. Stine. Some of my favourite moments include the voice moaning out &quot;Bloody fingers....&quot; and the hippie is just, like, &quot;Get a band-aid, man!&quot; and the Viper (&quot;I'm here to vash and vipe the vindows&quot;).<br />These stories were collected from folklore and retold by Alvin Swartz. And you'll find all types of timeless, classic tales in here. Ghost stories, graverobber stories, tales of people raised by wild animals, zombie stories, humourous stories, even modern tales based on urban legends. Each book is prefaced with some history, and their are annoted sources and extensive bibliographies.<br />There are loads of creepy, morbid, and yes, scary illustrations throughout the book in ink and grey watercolour...very gravelike. Some of them still creep me out today years later. Some of them might give you nightmares and resurface in front of you when you're all alone in the dark.<br />To make a scary atmosphere try reading these on a dark, rainy, preferably stormy night by flashlight. Put on Danny Elfman's creepy, creepy soundtrack to &quot;Sleepy Hollow.&quot; Listen for unexplained crashes, creaks, and moans in between crashes of thunder...read some more...you will end up scared in the end.	2001-10-17

I ordered the &quot;Egypt Game&quot; waay back in Grade 3 or so and have read it a million times. I loved the character development, the sneaking around, April's melodramatic flares, and the rituals of the Egypt Game.<br />Two days ago I found out that Zilpha Keatley Snyder had written &quot;Gypsy Game&quot; as a sequel. I read the Amazon.com reviews and was surprised to see that it received such poor ratings. However, based on my love for &quot;The Egypt Game&quot; and my love of Roma (Gypsy culture) I bought it and have just finished it. Here is my verdict:<br />I liked the fact that Toby was part Gypsy and had a shawl and jewellery that his Rom grandmother had left him, plus the fact that Toby's dad chipped in and provided a caravan.<br />I also liked how April and Melanie started practicing palmistry and showed some enthusiasm...that seemed more like the old gang. A major disappointment was that the plot really had nothing to do with the Gypsy game although it was a decent mystery by itself.<br />The character development is sadly lacking, and April doesn't seem like the same person at all. All she seems to do is fight with Melanie and everyone else sits around arguing. No one can agree and the game is never played. Toby as the protagonist is a fresh new voice but not enough to successfully keep the reader's attention for 218 pages.<br />I could definitely feel both the changed writing style and the 30-year gap between the books...it felt like the 1990's even though the story was supposed to take place directly after the Egypt Game.<br />The book was extremely depressing: the story of Toby's mom, the persecution of the Gypsies in Europe, Toby's hunger and loneliness, and the plight of the homeless Garbo, Vince and Mickey. The first two chapters made it seem like the Gypsy Game would once again be magical, but the magic quickly disappeared.<br />I won't say that this book is a complete waste of time, but it does seem to drag on, dwell on dark subjects, and is lacking all the mystery and excitement of The Egypt Game. It is a decent mystery on its own but I was expecting a sequel that followed the lines of the original, especially with a title as promising as &quot;The Gypsy Game.&quot;king all the mystery and excitement of The Egypt Game.

I saw a review of &quot;Sacr&eacute; Blues&quot; in a Canadian newspaper (I don't remember which one) and decided that, since I was in Qu&eacute;bec and frankly quite clueless regarding many aspects of Qu&eacute;bec history and culture, I picked up a copy at an Archambault in Sainte-Foy. I had resolved to put it away for the return train trip to Toronto, but I started reading a little bit each night. At some points in the book I was laughing out loud so much my neighbours must have wondered about my sanity.<br />I spent a month in Qu&eacute;bec and plan to return often, and &quot;Sacr&eacute; Blues&quot; helped me to understand some of the issues in modern Qu&eacute;bec. I have taken a Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois civilisation course, but there are many topics in the book that elaborated on things we had touched on in class, such as Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois winters, language, popular culture, famous people, the strange and fascinating addiction to cholesterol-laden food (poutine! May Wests! Pepsi!), tabloid newspapers, politics, the Florib&eacute;cois (retired Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois who migrate in droves to Florida every winter), C&eacute;line Dion, and much, much more.<br />Grescoe writes with tongue-in-cheek humour that sometimes amounts to laugh-out-loud guffawing, such as the Qu&eacute;bec Language Police...something that I evidence firsthand. Some of the topics seemed to go on for much too long, but generally the book is funny and informative, sort of a mini-introduction to Qu&eacute;bec. Very well written, with a glossary of terms and famous Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, important dates, and cultural notes.	2001-10-15

Much of the content of &quot;The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago&quot; was touched upon during the lecture: the religious background, various myths and legends, stories from the rural villages along the road, and the spiritual experience involved.<br />One of my favourite moments was when Davidson asked, &quot;What is a pilgrimage?&quot; The audience was composed of various nationalities, religions and ethnic groups, but we all had ideas to offer. The third or fourth brave soul said that a pilgrimage was a religious experience. She continued her explanation and we arrived at the definition of a pilgrimage as a journey that takes one away from comforts and friends, a journey of self-discovery, and one that must be made on foot.<br />She mentioned other secular pilgrimages: Graceland, the Alamo, and on a more sombre note, the Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City and the former site of the World Trade Centre in New York City. A pilgrimage can extend to finding a deeper meaning in life, not necessarily of a religious nature, a pilgrimage as a voyage of discovery.<br />I was fortunate to attend Linda Kay Davidson's seminar; I learned a great deal about pilgrimages in general and Santiago de Compostela, about the history of the region, the terrain, the rural towns and friendly townsfolk, cloistered nuns who had not seen the next village over and would never do so except by postcard, the architecture, from gothic to baroque, the sometimes humorous stories of saints' lives, the sombre roadside shrines for pilgrims who ultimately did not finish their journey.<br />This is an excellent guide to Santiago de Compostela whether you are merely interested in reading more about the region or if you are planning a pilgrimage yourself. And if you have the chance to see Linda Kay Davidson in person, do so. She makes the journey a memorable one, taking time at the end of the seminar to show a brief slideshow with a medieval soundtrack and had us mentally create (or recreate) a pilgrimage of our own to Compostela. It was a fascinating experience and one I won't soon forget.have the chance to see Linda Kay Davidson in person, do so.

Its discussion of flute construction, fingering, scales, ornaments, and care and maintenance is excellent. The book expects the reader to have a basic grasp of musical notation and concepts.<br />An added bonus: eighteen of R. Carlos Nakai's tunes transcribed for flute. These are: December Snow, 12/13/82 song, Wioste Olowan Inkpa taya, Wioste Olowan Tokiya, 11/3/82 song, Death song, 11/11/82 song, Zuni song, 12/20/82 song, 12/13/82 no. 2 song, 11/20/82 song, Whippoorwill, Whirlwinds Dancing, Coventry Carol, Rainy Nights in Taos, Omaha song, The Colours Fall, and Crow Wing.<br />There is also an excellent chapter at the end of the book regarding R. Carlos Nakai's recordings and his influences. Ken Light, the maker of Amon Olorin flutes (R. Carlos Nakai plays an Amon Olorin Sonoran) also contributes. This is an indispensable guide to the Native American flute and is worth the cost.	2000-12-10

Although it's probably already been said, this masterpiece perfectly captures the magic, mystery, and uncertainty of a child's world. Harry is the champion of underdogs who becomes a hero. He is loyal, humble, and honest although his early life was one of cruelty and indifference. His friends plot, scheme, and feast upon Every Flavour Beans while using their wits and magical powers to narrowly escape danger and disaster.<br />Rowling cleverly depicts the boorish father and mother who dote upon their rather unintelligent and spiteful son Dudley but who basically deny the existence of Harry.<br />A magical read for all ages. Although the book is currently banned in some places, at least children are putting down the controllers for their Nintendos or Segas or computers and picking up a real book--nothing virtual about that. Along with Harry children are rediscovering the magic in their everyday lives. A modern masterpiece reminiscent of Roald Dahl. 10 stars.	2000-12-10

I was drawn in by the individuality of the characters, their day to day challenges and struggles, and the strength that all characters showed in the face of the unknown. I just received &quot;Una isla como tu&quot; last week after deciding that I wanted to read the book in the true language of the characters, and I wasn't disappointed by the translation.<br />The Spanish novel is every bit as compelling and graceful as its English counterpart, and great care is taken not to change any of the details. I believe that reading this novel in Spanish makes these stories of the barrio even more authentic, and this is an excellent translation that shouldn't be missed. The reading level of Spanish should be accessible to high school and university students studying Spanish.	2000-12-06

This novel came out after the first season premiered, and it perfectly captures  the mystery, excitement and wonder of Ocean Girl. Much of the flavour of  the series and its characters has been captured, although translating the  magnificent visuals of the Daintree rainforest does not fare as well.  Still, author Peter Hepworth makes a brave attempt. An example:<br />\\"Snow  white sands curved out of sight on either side. Beyond the beach great  strands of rainforest trees grew thick and tall, their trunks interlaced  with vines and creepers. Brilliantly coloured birds flashed from branch to  branch and butterflies the size of bread-and-butter plates flitted through  the air. They made their way inland, Neri leading the way. Each turn of the  track revealed new sights. Dripping clusters of bright tropical flowers.  Little marsupials who sat up on their hind legs like tiny kangaroos and  watched them pass. Huge emerald tree frogs with golden eyes.\\"<br />Ocean Girl  is an excellent companion to an amazing New Age TV series.
