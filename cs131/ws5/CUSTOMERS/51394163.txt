If you are interested in the build up of the Nazi's from 1936, the preparations for war and the war itself, then it's definitly worth reading. In places, I couldn't help feeling it resemble THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH, with a little more detail. Mr Kershaw has obviously done extensive research. While he offers little new information, he does offer more detail and analysis of that information, but loses sight, in places, of the fact that the books is supposed to be about Hitler and not an account, neccessarily of WWII, which it does end up look more like. Perhaps the author felt that broadening the picture helps put Hitler into perspective...<br />The book is well written, easy to understand, if a little hard in places. I wouldn't consider this to be &quot;light&quot; reading. How historically accurate, can anyone really know for sure? Certainly, worth reading...if you have the time.	2001-09-09

I was a little concerned at the word &quot;spiritual&quot; and potential religious interpretations, but had to buy the book for school anyway, so I did.<br />I was delighted to find a guide that actually worked. If you get this book for no other reason than the &quot;Morning Pages&quot; discussed in the first pages of the book, then get it. The book resembles a sort of 12-step program. In fact it is 12 chapters long and outlines and discusses ways to help you draw from and replenish your &quot;creative well&quot;.<br />The excercises are straightforward and make sense. Ms Cameron doesn't waste time wandering off on meaningless tangents. As I've mentioned, I was surprised because I didn't think my &quot;creative well&quot; was particularly dry. However, once I started using this book (and becoming a believer in the methods described therein), I've been overflowing with ideas.<br />The book is spiritual without being religious, so if you're worried about a religious excercise, fear not! I am happy to report that this is not one of these &quot;you need to find God to help you&quot; books at all. It's a pleasant and useful book that can and does help you look a little deeper inside yourself. You'll be quite amazed at what you find.	2001-09-01

I remember it from my father's book collection. Anyway, it held my attention and I finished it about four days. William Shirer spent many years in Germany until about half way during WWII. His experiences during that time as a reporter allowed him to tell a more-or-less accurate story and tell it in a fashion that, unlike many historical books, is enjoyable to read.<br />Some would argue as to the 100% accuracy of the book or to it's relevence to history. Personally, having read (and I'm not exaggerating) most of the so called &quot;classic&quot; biographies on the Nazi leadership, philosophy, policatal system and anything else, I think it is a very important contribution that covers the important parts of the Third Reich (1933-45) in detail. I think, given when it was written, that it is surprisingly unbiased and fair and Shirer has done his best to keep his personal feelings out of the book. He does make observations from time to time, but usually only in situations where he was actually present at the event.<br />If you are new to the subject of the Nazi rise to power and the subsequent 12 years, then I cannot think of a better place to start. There are other books on the subject, but few that are as easy to read and cover quite as much as this one.	2001-08-31

I would not call it the confession, but rather biography of Donald Cabana who worked in the prison system for a number of years and, as warden, oversaw the execution of two people.<br />The book is very well written, easy to understand and is, in my opinion, quite humble. Donald Cabana had a remarkable and varied career. His feelings about capital punishment, especially after personally overseeing executions, are interesting to read about. There are not too many books from this unique point of view.<br />If you're looking for detail on the death penalty process or execution technology then there are better books to read. If you are looking for an interesting biography with some insights into relationships between prison staff and inmates, then this is the perfect book.	2001-08-31

One of the books that I think every screenwriter should have on hand. It's easy to read (from cover to cover) and is like having a quick reference whenever you need to check something. You would be surprised how many other books reference this one, which gives it much credibility.<br />Trottier covers everything from story structure, character development to screenwriting layout, formatting and all those annoying little things we forget about. For under $20, it's a very worthwhile investment and I recommend keeping it on hand if you're serious about screenwriting.	2001-08-30

On the whole, it's got some useful examples that can teach you some of the basics. I feel, however, that a lot of space was wasted in trying to oversimply and overdescribe screens where a little more detail would have been appropriate.

Having a great story is one thing, getting it sold (or even read) by someone is hard work.<br />Ms. Herbert's book covers the script development and review process more than most books. She doesn't delve quite so much into story development, act structure etc. that you would expect to find in standard screenwriting books. This gives her book a refreshing edge because it looks at the industry rather than the art of script writing.<br />Having said that, however, the writer does come across as a little too negative. By the end of the first couple of chapters, it's quite obvious that Hollywood is a tough place to break into and it will be hard work to do so, but she keeps beating it into the reader so that, by the time, you've reach the halfway mark you want to say &quot;HEY! I'VE GOT IT. OKAY!&quot;. I'm also a little unsure about some of her suggested methods for getting a script into the hands of a producer or director (dressing up as a pizza delivery person and delivering it) or her seemingly strong belief that you can't break into the movie industry unless you live in California (preferably in LA).<br />Nontheless, there are some good parts of the book that make it worth reading (hence the 4 stars). Ms. Herbert does have a unique insiders perspective (she was a scripts reviewer and teaches screenwriting) so it's worth paying attention.	2001-08-28

It was easy to read for a novice Flash  developer like myself. The examples, especially along with the companion  CD, are simple to follow and easy to learn. I've been using it as a  reference book for several weeks now and I bought it out of desparation and  a lack of online documentation within Flash itself.<br />This is a book you  can read from cover to cover or pick the area of interest. The authors  describe some fairly complicated issues well and, for the most part, I felt  they sufficiently covered the subjects I needed so that, by the end of the  book, I was able to rebuild my website entirely in Flash and make it look  quite decent too.<br />I would agree with the complaints about too much  &quot;Flash with other software&quot; sections of the book. While some of  these may be useful to some people, I think too much time was spent on  integration topics. I would much rather have seen more in-depth looks at  programming and more detail on forms handling and user  interaction.<br />Nonetheless, I don't think this spoils the book at all. If  you're a starter then this isn't a bad place to begin. As a more  experienced Flash developer, I'm sure it's a useful desk reference to keep  handy.	2000-08-19

The examples are easy to follow and the text is  well presented and easy to understand (especially for people who hate  technical books).<br />If you are looking for an introduction to ASP and have  not yet purchased the SAMS 24 hour book, consider this one instead. They do  cover a lot of the things that the other book has in it. Towards the back  end, they have examples of email forwarding from forms and other bits and  pieces that are not directly related to e-commerce, but were the reasons I  got the other book.<br />If you are trying to build a full-blown store online,  start here.

What makes this book so intense is that you know it's real. It is well written, descriptive without being overbearing and detatched enough to give you a fair perspective. The movie runs along similar lines as the book,  except the method of execution, and the book delves into far more detail,  as you would expect. Although an anti-death penalty activist, Helen Prejean  has not written a anti-death penalty book. It's a straightforward narrative  that draws the reader in and doesn't let go. She is a very talented lady  and you feel a huge respect for what she does. Very compelling reading.	2000-06-30

This book starts out brilliantly, a mysterious death linked somehow to an animal research facility in Africa.

However, about two-thirds of the way through the book, the  story seems to gain speed, almost leaping to a conclusion that left this  ready feeling a little let-down and wondering why it felt as though Mr.  Cook has rushed it. Nonetheless, if you're a Robin Cook fan, read the book.  If you're thinking of trying a Robin Cook story, try another one (may I  suggest &quot;Contagion&quot;) because this one may not be the one that  hooks you.	2000-06-28

The book reads like a badly written essay. Events happen too quickly and  much to easily. I find the thought that a highly advanced alien race can be  so easily deceived by people who for hundreds of years have lived as little  more than cavemen completely laughable.<br />As with the other LRH books, I  cannot understand what makes people give this book such high marks. I'm not  SF snob, but this book insulted my intelligence. LRH does not hold a candle  to Asimov, Calark, Bova or any of the other more serious SF  writers.<br />Chances are, it doesn't matter what I say, you'll probably read  this book anyway.

His travels through small town USA are therefor  part-tourist, part-native. His insights are very accurate and his  desciptions are informative without being dull.<br />Once or twice, he  overdoes the humor by repeating a joke, but he more than makes up for that  in othe parts of the book. Mr. Bryson shows us a side of the US that not  many of us see in our mad-dash everyday lives. I first read this book while  living in England and then again after living in Arizona for a number of  years. Having had the benefit of spending time in both places, I  appreciated the humor more the second time around.<br />The Lost Continent is  not a guide book and you're not going to find it too much use if you're  planning a drive across the country. However, it's a useful book to read if  you want to take a little time to notice the smaller, less significant  parts of the world that we pass by.<br />And it's still the best of all his  books.	2000-06-28

The ability to write this pseudo-science  fiction has been a winning strategy for so long that this book came as a  real suprise.<br />A multi-billionaire has sponsored an effort that has  resulted in a time travel machine that allows scientists to visit France in  the middle ages. So far, so good. However, a group of American college  students, excavating an old castle, are suddenly swept up in a crisis when  it turns our their professor has vanished. The evil billionaire asks that  they go back in time and find him...just after they have excavated their  professors eyeglasses from their site!<br />Sorry if it sounds like I'm being  sarcastic, but this book is a screenplay. It reads like a film, not a book.  The time machine description is interesting, and good, but the events  surrounding the adventure are awful...and made for a Hollywood  blockbuster.<br />Going back in time, the students wear little ear pieces that  immediatly translate medieval French into English. They manage to pass as  citizens and mingle freely, interacting perfectly...too easily. They even  manage to joust in a tournament!<br />There is no suspense and the outcome is  sadly predictable.

I find the subject of the Nazi party and how they destroyed Germany interesting. Having read books like William Shirers &quot;The rise and fall of the Third Reich&quot;, I felt this book would give me more of an  insiders view and who better than a survivor of the Nuremburg trials to  write it?<br />Speer spends some time giving us his personal history, but  moves on quickly to his first meeting with Hitlers and his invovlement with  the Nazi party. His career was quite remarkable. His rise was legendedary.  However, I walked away feeling as though he hadn't told me  everything.<br />During and after the trials at Nuremburg, many people felt  that Speer had saved himself by &quot;accepting&quot; responsibility for  his actions and more or less thrown himself at the mercy of the court. He  does a little of this in the book, but it isn't convincing. He comes across  like too much of a goodie-two-shoes. &quot;Yes, we did this, but I had no  idea how bad it was until afterwards&quot;.<br />Still, it fills in a lot of  information about the events not reported in the press and in subsequent  publications. It's worthwhile reading the book and at the end you can't  help feeling that perhaps he got away with something that he took with him  to the grave.	2000-05-19

Beginning with a specific execution in 1979, the first since the death penatly was reinstated, the author pans out and  discusses other aspects of the death penalty system and the players that  are involved in the killing process as well as those trying to prevent it.  I read it in a day, so it had to be good!	2000-05-19

That's not to say all other fantasy books are bad, but there are a lot that resemble The Hobbit / Lord of the Rings in some way or another.<br />This first book in the  Saga of the Exiles series takes us back to prehistoric Earth from the  future using a one-way time machine. The world if beautifully painted and  the large number of central characters are alternated between  wonderfully.<br />The two alien races inhabiting prehostoric France are well  developed with a thoughtful background and unique and entertaining  characteristics. I couldn't put this book down from the moment I picked it  up and I am delighted that there are more in the series because by the end  of this book you want to know more.	2000-05-19

This book is an outrageously funny look at corporate life. If you work or have worked in an office, this book is for you.  At some point or another, every corporate employee has worked with one or more of the characters from  Dilbert. Scott Adams pokes gently fun and along with multiple cartoons to  illustrate his points, he make the reader laugh and say &quot;I've been  there&quot;. This is a funny book. I didn't expect Mr. Adams to be able to  pull it off. I thought the cartoons were great but that he would not be  able to transfer his skill to bookwriting. I am delighted to say I was  wrong. This is a delight to read and re-read. Thank you for making me  laugh.	2000-05-19

I hate technical books like this but I was impressed after the first couple of chapters. In plain, simple English, you are walked through the architecture and set up of ASP and the environment in which to run it. The  modules are well thought out and easy-to-follow. You don't get lost.<br />If  you already have some ASP experience, then this book will probably be a  little basic. for someone like me who needed to do some form-submissions  using email and page counters, the book is ideal. I was up and running in a  couple of hours (you can skip bits).<br />My only complaint is with  troubleshooting. The writers tell you what results to expect which is good,  but they don't tell you what to do if you don't get the results you expect.  This is particularly the case with the database modules where I had some  problems writing to a database and I had followed the instructions to the  letter.<br />However, an overall good starter book and I recommend it  thoroughly.	2000-05-19
