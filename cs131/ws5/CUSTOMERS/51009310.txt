I think Graham Joyce is an excellent writer. In my opinion, his books \\"Tooth Fairy\\" and \\"The Facts Of Life\\" are masterpieces. They're both books that teach a lesson about staying human in a world where difficult experiences can turn even the best people into shriveled, bitter husks; about surviving through adversity; about growing up and enjoying life through the good and the bad. Those books do all of this with a wonderful sense of magic, whimsy, wit, and emotion; they are good examples of what is often called \\"magical realism.\\" <br /> <br />However, \\"The Limits Of Enchantment\\" is a definite step backwards, or perhaps more astutely, Joyce is standing in place on this one. Both \\"Tooth Fairy\\" and \\"Facts of Life\\" were great portraits of the old ways dying out and meeting the new. I think this works especially well in Europe; \\"The Facts of Life\\" was set in the 40s and 50s, \\"Tooth Fairy\\" the late 50s and early 60s. What's interesting about these times is that they were sort of the nexus between the very old and the very new: as late as the 1950s, even, you had ultra-modern cities not terribly different from todays that existed along side rural hamlets where not much had changed since the 1830s, where many people still did not have phones, automobiles, or even electricity. It's that junction between the two eras that provides a particularly fertile breeding ground for storytelling, particularly in \\"The Facts of Life.\\" <br /> <br />However, most the mistakes that \\"The Facts of Life\\" doesn't make, unfortunately \\"The Limits of Enchantment\\" does. The former of these two books managed to illustrate the human drama without falling into melodrama; it managed to tell the tale of ordinary people caught in extraordinary times without being too folksy, cloying, or precious; and it has fully fleshed-out characters who usually manage to subvert and rise above the stereotypes. \\"The Limits of Enchantment\\" does none of these things and falls into the traps stated. <br /> <br />Fern, islike Cassie from FoL, a wispy girl with a better sense of the magic of the unseen world than that of the real. However, Joyce let Cassie be flighty, unresponsible, and ethereal. Cassie did not have to carry the story all by herself. Fern pretty much has to. Mammy is too much like the matriarch of the family in FoL, except with even more no-nonsense gruff love, folksy sayings, and down-home wisdom, so much so it's cloying. <br /> <br />The story is about Mammy, a midwife, and her daughter Fern. Both possess magical knowledge and instincts. They live in rural England, and Mammy is an old-time midwife who doesn't feel she has to meet the qualifications of the modern medical world (a theme also briefly touched upon in FoL). Fern is her assistant and student of unconventional lore. Everything is going pretty much okay, even with hippie-biker Arthur trying to court Fern and giving her (somewhat) unwanted attention. Then there's a unfortunate accident that turns the townsfolk into the equivalent of villagers with torches and pitchforks, Mammy falls ill, Fern's sanity is questioned, the county threatens to foreclose their home, and a number of offbeat characters may represent Fern's only hope to save herself and her mother and learn a thing or two about magic and herself along the way. <br /> <br />It sounds okay, but like I said earlier, I think Joyce has been down these roads once too often, and unlike his earlier works, he lays it on too thick here. We get more passages laying on the mystery and wonder of magic here than we have in the past, the plot turns are more sappy, overwrought, unlikely, and melodramatic than in the past, the characters are painted with a broader brush and not fleshed out as well, and the whole atmosphere is at times too melodramatic, too saccharine, too wistful, too cloying, and even too sappy. <br /> <br />I think Graham Joyce is a fantastic writer; I know he can do better than this. This is not a bad book. From another author, it might be a great work. But not for Joyce. I think it's time he moved on to a different type/style of novel for a while. In all honestly, he executed this type of novel so perfectly and wondrously in \\"The Facts of Life\\" that he really had nothing left to prove. I think he used up his best tricks for that book and subsequently was left with little her, and it shows by pale example. I recommend this book, but would recommend reading Joyce's other works first so you can appreciate what he is truly capable of.	2005-10-03

I can hardly believe this is only the 7th review for this book; it seems almost criminal it has gone this unnoticed. Graham Joyce doesn't write bad books, and time spent reading his novels is never a waste. This book, in my opinion, may well be his opus, his all-around best work. You're not going to find too many people who agree with that; most people would pick \\"Tooth Fairy.\\" I like \\"Tooth Fairy\\" quite a bit but I think I have to pick this book by the slimmest of margins, and I've read nearly all of Joyce's book. <br /> <br />\\"The Facts Of Life\\" is about a post-WWII family in Coventry (one of the hardest hit cities by Hitler's bombs, and rebuilt horribly), England, headed by the matriarch, Martha. Martha experiences strange portents and one of her 7 daughters, Cassie, is even more inclined to the supernatural, so much so she's flightly and perhaps insane to some people. She becomes pregnant in a vividly and evocatively written, chaos-fueled night revealed later in the book. Like her previous baby, she is expected to give up for adoption, because, as a somewhat crazy, irresponsible and *single* mother, the family does not think she can take care of the child. When she goes to give up her child, she is struck by a strange flurry of feelings and decides to keep her child, named Frank, consequences be damned.  <br /> <br />From there the narrative proceeds in uneven leaps in time. For a while Frank stays with Cassie and Martha, but in time they need to move Frank to a different daughter's care in rotation. Things become more complicated as it becomes apparent Frank may have magical perceptions and abilities of his own. <br /> <br />While this book doesn't have a hard-fast plot, Joyce works fantastic characterizations, enough to put Charles Dickens, P.G. Wodehouse, or Honore de Balzac to shame. <br /> <br />Beatrice is the \\"smart\\" one, who works at an aircraft factory, joins a union, and becomes a Beat, espousing typical Socialist programming of the time, and experimenting with life in a commune. While she may come off as a Michael Stivak type, she tries harder not to be overbearing or talk down to anyone; the same holds true for her \\"significant other,\\" Bernard is similar, a very earnest young man with a lot of ideals. These two characters are very sympathetic because they are never allowed to devolve into effete, elitist snobs. <br /> <br />There are so many good characters in this novel, it's hard to pick favorites. Tom and Aida are quite sympathetic, Tom is like the dad many people wished they had, strong, smart without being book smart, hard-working, kind, honest. Aida and Gordon are less sympathetic, but both are totally human.  <br /> <br />But the narrative of the story focuses chiefly on Cassie and her son Frank, and while Cassie is not the most sympathetic character in the novel, she may be the most compelling even as she stands difficult to pigeonhole. \\"The Facts of Life\\" is the story of how Cassie takes Frank to live from home to home, sister to sister. It is interesting to see how they live at each place, and of the various challenges that come their way in the Brave New World of post-WWII England. This is not a story just about Cassie and Frank, it is also about a strong mother holding her family apart during difficult times; a man haunted by his dead friend's bride; the search for spirituality; the difficult fight between the ways of the old world and the encroachment of the new; the joys and sorrows of family life; growing up without dying inside; and many other themes.  <br /> <br />\\"The Facts Of Life\\" presents one of the most vividly and intelligently written cast of characters that I can remember in my recent reading history. Just seeing what happens next to these people is enough driving force of the book, and the time and place that they live is evocative and compelling enough to almost make you feel like you were there, laughing and crying along with them. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this novel highly enough; I think my review has done it poor justice, but to get a fairer sense of it, it should be read anyway. It's difficult to summarize and do proper homage to such a fine, fine book as this. Everyone should give this book a shot.	2005-10-03
US	51009310	R1S0HERTXLFVH6	0345324072	327588713	Usher's Passing	Books	5	26	28	N	N	A great horror book I just keep coming back to.	I think the reason why I enjoy this book so much is its use of typical gothic horror trappings, which I love. What can I say, I like the classic, i.e. what others might call \\"tired out cliches.\\" \\"Usher's Passing\\" by Robert McCammon, a very fine author, is just a good old fashioned horror story. <br /> <br />The story starts off with a vignette from the past. The Ushers are a real family, and their patriarch is angry that Edgar Allan Poe has come so close to the truth about their peculiar form of degeneracy. But when he sees how badly off Poe is himself, he realizes he can let it slide and no one would believe him anyway. <br /> <br />Forward to the \\"present day\\" (in this case, 1984). Rix Usher is a descendant of the original Ushers of the Poe tale, and he's very troubled. He's kind of a loser prone to crippling panic attacks (which we learn is a malady all the Ushers suffer from), and he is recovering from his wife's suicide. His father, who he broke with when he was growing up, is dying, and either Rix, his older, disgusting brother Boone (think of a combination of Animal House's Bluto and Back To The Future's Biff Tannen, and you have Boone), or his sleek drug adddict model sister Kat will inherit the vast estate in the mountains of southwest North Carolina known as \\"Usherland\\" along with the $10 billion armanent company that the family has grown fat on. So they all return to the eerie estate and find much more in store for them then they had in mind. <br /> <br />This book positively oozes that feeling of autumn horror in a way unlike anything I've read since Ray Bradbury. The setting is wonderful - Usherland is a sprawling, enormous mountain estate made even more fascinating through a number of facets. For instance, a bunch of backwards hillfolk live on the fringes of the estate (it's thousands of acres, hard to keep an eye on that much land). All the leaves are changing color, giving it that harvest time Halloween effect. It has cliffs, holes, and briarpatches,making it extremely difficult to navigate. What's more, this parcel of land is stalked by not one but two supernatural killers - the black-as-pitch panther Greediguts and the terrifying Pumpkin Man, both of whom have been killing for ages in the area. If that's not enough for you, somewhere on this property is an abandoned, ruined lodge that no one will set foot in and Rix has horrible half-memories of getting lost in as a child. <br /> <br />I really like that set-up, and the story's execution is quite good as well, but I have to agree somewhat with the previous review that the nosy reporter and the rather unbelievable media interest in the family were the weakest points of the story. Yet, they were necessary to move the story along. <br /> <br />The story has some good surprises along the way and the loose ends all get wrapped up. It's a great read that trades well off its fantastic atmosphere and setting. Highly recommended.	2005-10-02
US	51009310	R2H21TJV6T9AHW	015626224X	789289309	Down and Out in Paris and London	Books	5	3	4	N	N	One of my all-time favorite books, and one of Orwell's best.	But be warned: I think nowadays this book is more suitable for three groups of readers: those who have an interest in novels of the picaresque; those with a historical interest in Paris, or to a lesser extent, London; or general fans of George Orwell's fine works. <br /> <br />I fit into all three of those categories. This is a great novel for so many reasons. It gives you a historical sense of the picaresque novel. Before Chuck Palahnuik, Chuck Bukowski, or even William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac were writing stories about the tragic/comedy/just plain interesting adventures of the down-and-out, George Orwell was here. This book can be seen as a blueprint for more recent works - it has definite parallels and similarities with Burroughs' \\"Junky,\\" Bukowski's \\"Factotum,\\" and even Palahnuik's \\"Fight Club.\\" <br /> <br />It's also a great historical work. It is largely autobiographical. The adventures of poor artists in Paris has long been a fascinating, and autobiographical, subject in literature. From the drug binges of Charles Baudelaire, to the fictional-but-based-in-true-experience of the poverty-wracked (among others) faithfully portrayed by Balzac, to Picasso and Modigliani's frolics in Montmartre, to Louis-Ferdinand Celine's justifiable famous portrayal of World War I Paris (and other environs) in his tour-de-force \\"Journey To The End of the Night,\\" to Henry Miller's debauchery in the city of lights as most famously noted in \\"The Tropic Of Cancer,\\" Orwell's novel here has many peers (Henry Miller was one) and precedents. If any of these subjects interest you, then I suggest you check out this book. <br /> <br />It's also good for Orwell fans in general, and it contains more of his trademark warmth and cynicism; his segues into politics; and his tongue-in-cheek examination of the bizarre and absurd. <br /> <br />Finally, this is just a great book, period. This novel is based on a time in his life when he dropped out of respectable society and moved into a ramshackle residental hotel in Paris to get a taste of lower class Parisian life. His experiences as a poverty-stricken hotel restaurant worker are stirring, gripping, absurd, tragic, and comedic. They run the gamut of emotions with a cast of many odd characters of every walk of life: hustlers, exiled Russians, meglomaniacal cooks, Oscar Wilde-emulating starving artists, and many more. As others have noted, the breakneck, full-throttle insanity of Paris is much more fun to read about than the staid, rather boring London. It's like going from San Francisco to Salt Lake City (no offense to those hailing from Utah). Even though this book was written long ago, it's highly readable, and a fantastic insight into the human condition, of what it means to be human in a certain period of time, and how people live their lives and get by in the face of seemingly impossible odds. <br /> <br />I highly recommend that everyone read this book.	2005-09-04

I don't know why I haven't gotten around to reviewing this collection of work before, but it is amazing! As the title suggests, it is the collected covers of the Sandman comic book series that ran from 1989-1996. There are no Sandman stories in here, just the collected covers of all the issues and some commentary on the covers and The Sandman series by Neil Gaiman himself. <br /> <br />\\"Just.\\" I love this book. It's \\"Art\\" with a capital \\"A.\\" So many different styles, forms, and moods. It's beauty and magic captured on paper. It calls to mind art as diverse Edward Gorey, Salvadore Dali, the movies of Tim Burtn, and on one startling cover even H.R. Geiger (in a non-Aliens way).  <br /> <br />The introduction is very nice too. <br /> <br />I recommend this for any fan of the Sandman series.	2005-09-04

Yoshitaka Amano is best known in the United States for the character designs behind the Final Fantasy series, perhaps his character designs from Final Fantasy 3 (6 in Japan) have garnered the most fame. In anime, he is best known in America for his work on Vampire Hunter D. His collaboration with Neil Gaiman, the simply jaw-dropping \\"Dream Hunters\\" also brought him to the attention of a new audience and brought about some cross-media interest as Gaiman also worked on the American adaptation of Princess Princess Mononoke. <br /> <br />However, Amano has done a lot more in video games and anime, and he has done far more than these. Versatile in many artistic mediums, and a wide array of subject matter, moreso than many people realize.  <br /> <br />His wispy, ethereal style, like a pale, almost insubstantial ghost of smoke often used in his fantasy, in which the subjects almost seem too delicate, fragile, and beautiful to actually exist, is present here. However, he does more, so much more. Bold, even loud colors and shockingly assertive shapes manifest themselves in a way that may be unfamiliar to fans of Amano's work in \\"Dream Hunters\\" which seems, like the title, languid and dreamlike. In many prints he has eschewed the wispy, angular style of some of his video game/anime character designs. Many of them retain an almost florid sense of color. In fact, it's so diverse it's not easy to pinpoint into one \\"style.\\" A description of one print invariably will not fit the entire book. There is much here that looks nothing like the style found in Final Fantasy or \\"Dream Hunters.\\" This may be disappointing to fans of those works, but there is much here to appreciate.  <br /> <br />So it may be helpful to forget what you know about Amano if your experience is limited (and mine is limited indeed) and simply enjoy the prints collected in this book and the sensations they bring. There is a nice variety of prints in here, expected and unexpected. It is not an exhaustive, comprehensive collection of all of his artwork, but it's the next best thing. <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend it to anyone who enjoys art.	2005-09-04
US	51009310	R3JLFZC35BGFX6	0843951818	51383965	Blood Games	Books	4	8	11	N	N	One of Laymon's better books, definitely.	My favorite Richard Laymon novel is probably \\"The Traveling Vampire Show,\\" but this one ranks right up there as well, right up there with \\"In The Dark\\" and a little better than \\"Island\\" or \\"One Rainy Night\\" in my humble opinion. <br /> <br />The way it's written does hearken back to the horror writing in the 1980s, and is somewhat reminiscent of situations and phrasings by authors like King, Straub, Ramsey Campbell, Robert McCammon, etc. from that time period. So when people say it does feel outdated, they have a point, but I prefer to think of it as feeling refreshing in a throwback type of way. Also, you just have to remember when it was written and accept it. <br /> <br />Laymon's typical loving description of body parts and people getting undressed in the oddest (and most contrived) of situations is present as well, as well as somewhat sexual scenes where you wouldn't expect them to be (would you try and sex up some guy you thought might be a serial killer when you're all alone in the wilderness? Probably not). It doesn't make for good realism (you shouldn't be reading Laymon if that's what you're after) but it does make for good pulpy escapism. You either have to accept this is what Laymon does or move on to another author.  <br /> <br />The story does the now-famous Godfather 2 style unfolding of events, where the present story is interspersed with illuminating stories from the past. 4 women in their mid-20s, who met and had adventures while in college vow to keep close to one another, and not grow old peacefully, so they all go on \\"adventures\\" together one week every year. They rotate having each of the women chose an adventure a year. This year, the adventure is chosen by the frumpiest of the characters - a woman who loves horror movies and books. She takes the girls to an abandoned, isolated lodge in Vermont where the guests and staff were gruesomely slaughtered by backwards hillbillies a few years earlier. <br /> <br />You have to remember, while it's extremely doubtful that murderous, inbred hillfolk live off the land in Vermont these days (the only state I can imagine that happening is some sadly impoverished and rural regions of southern and western Kentucky, where the high school graduation rate is under 50% in some counties) this was in the 1980s, when it seemed more possible and life was less advanced and more rural in places. <br /> <br />If you guess that someone will happen that leaves the girls trapped in the lodge, miles from nowhere, and that some disturbing things will happen to spook them, then a lot of what happens won't be a surprise to you. The treat is the writing though. Laymon does a good job with the characters of the young woman, each of them are drawn interestingly and distinctively, if not 100% realistically. Their college adventures are well-written (my favorites are their terrifying Halloween encounter, their revenge on a typical college jock, and the filming of a student horror movie). Also, the lodge and its surrounding wooded environs are sketched out with a real eye toward successfully building a great mood that's spooky, with a lot of foreshadowing. <br /> <br />The novel does have a bittersweet ending as you might expect from Laymon (few of his books have \\"happy\\" endings) but it doesn't cheapen anything that came before it.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, the pacing, atmosphere, and writing are good, and if you like gore and nudity, then you're in for a treat. Even if you don't like gore and nudity, this Laymon novel has a definite appeal that goes far beyond that. Recommended.	2005-09-04
US	51009310	RRHXQEYRJI8YZ	0670033944	748214467	The Mermaid Chair: A Novel	Books	1	180	209	N	N	An irritating, grating book that I wish I had not read.	Amazon.com's editorial review is so far off base it's stunning. It says \\"By boldly tackling such major themes as love, betrayal, grief, and forgiveness, The Mermaid Chair forces readers to question whether moral issues can always be interpreted in black or white.\\" I say, what book doesn't \\"tackle\\" this issues? They're so universal, few books don't \\"tackle\\" them? To say nothing of boldness.  <br /> <br />The only thing this book does boldly is advance a quasi-Ayn Rand like \\"philosophy\\" that essentially consists of the mantra \\"Selfishness is good.\\" Well, let me rephrase that. This book toutes subordination to one's every whim and desire and unrepentant selfishness with no thought to external consequences and wraps it up shabbily as the politics of reawakening and philosophy.  <br /> <br />If I could communicate one statement to the author, whose \\"Secret Life Of Bees\\" was an infinitely more charming book that did not groan under the weight of its preternaturally overburdened excesses and trite ambitions, it would be this: There are probably few protagonists less involving, sympathetic, and interesting than whiny, self-aggrandizing, navel-gazing narcissists.  <br /> <br />Reading this review, you might think I don't like books like these. That's not true. Introspection and questioning the fundamentals of one's life as a means to genuine, meaningful, and edifying self-realization and self-actualization can often be a fascinating read. But not this. This is a book about an utterly vapid woman whose obsession with herself and her own thoughts and feelings leads her to some rather shallow and unconvincing experimentations done far better in much older books. You've met people like this. Nothing fascinates them more than themselves, and they're endlessly questioning the meaning of their thoughts, feelings, etc. like they are the center of the universe. That's not interesting.  <br /> <br />Of course the author throws in the by-now-stereotypical \\"grave misfortune involving parents from childhood that was never dealt with that must be dealt with now\\" for good measure. Ugh. There's no growth, there's no learning going on here. If nothing else I've said about this book stays with you, then let this pronouncement - this book is an exercise in what happens people when they become too inwardly fixated to the point of narcissistic obsession. There's no growth, there's no learning. <br /> <br />To contrast, a number of years ago I read Graham Joyce's \\"Dark Sister\\" about a bored housewife who, after years of dutiful service to his husband, came, through magic of sorts, around to a legitimate exploration of what her life could be, especially in regards to her independence from her odious husband. It did so in a charming style that wasn't condescending or overly cloying, unlike this novel, and while it made the housewife's concerns paramount and somewhat inwardly focused, it did so without all of the annoying, whiny \\"Me! Me! Me!\\" prattling that passes as self-discovery in this book. <br /> <br />In short, I wouldn't recommend this book at all, unless you think self-discovery through unremittant self-indulgence and melodramatic emotional posturing sounds like a good time.	2005-08-27
US	51009310	R3Q7FLRIQH3LDF	1578050111	334145739	The Great Bear Rainforest: Canada's Forgotten Coast	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Wow. An amazing book about an amazing place.	For years, I had always heard snippets here and there about the Great Bear Rainforest of Northwestern British Columbia, supposedly even more beautiful, wild, untamed, and much larger than other gorgeous temperate rainforest locales like Olympic National Park in Washington. But I didn't really know much about it. Where exactly was it? What does it look like? Is any of it protected in province or federal park land? And many more questions. <br /> <br />Then, years later, I stumbled upon this book. WOW. That about sums it up. This is an amazing book about a place of transcendent, almost ethereal beauty. This book is an enchanting mix of imminently readable and interesting text and absolutely stunning photographs. It almost makes you feel like you are there, immersed in this incredible rain drenched emerald cathedral of trees. <br /> <br />The Great Bear Rainforest is located on the British Columbia coast. It starts a few miles north of Lund and extends all the way north in Canada to the BC's northernmost limit, around Port Rupert, and extends only a few miles inland. It is home to the largest remaining contiguous temperate rain forest anywhere in the world. You probably already know this, but a temperate rain forest is much different than a tropical rain forest because of climate. Temperate rain forests are cool and moist, whereas tropical ones are hot and moist. Anyway, enough of the obvious. <br /> <br />What I really like about this book is that it isn't a condescending piece of fluff, and it gave me *exactly* what I wanted from it. Even though it's no easily readable, it is no fluff piece that waxes prettily poetic but doesn't really tell you anything. It takes you on an incredibly detailed tour of nearly every major rain forest valley in the Great Bear Rainforest. And it doesn't just name-drop valleys that have no meaning to you, it provides you with maps that show exactly where it is that they are talking about. I think this is the greatest feature of the book, I've read too many books about geographical places that tell you the names of certain interesting areas, but you don't quite know where they are. Not so with this book. <br /> <br />Not only that, the book covers a wide range of topics concerning The Great Bear Rainforest. Ecology, economic pressures, animal and plant life, geography, even a lot of interesting history and contemporary issues concerning the First Nation (who we in the U.S. refer to as Native American) tribes who traditionally lived (and still live) in and around the Great Bear Rainforest. I found the parts about the Haida tribe to be particularly edifying. All of these facts and themes are woven into the narrative of the authors' journey through the Great Bear Rainforest (which spans many years) incredibly seamlessly - you might think it's difficult to talk about the flora and fauna of the area while giving a history lesson on the Tlinglit people, but like I said, this point interweaves all points flawlessly. It also does social justice by presenting an unflinching look at the environmental horrors that await the Great Bear Rainforest through resource extraction and recreation at the hands of an apathetic public if current trends remain unchecked. <br /> <br />And then there are the photos. Gorgeous. Vast stands of huge, majestic trees, so much green it's almost blinding; a spirit bear chowing down on salmon in an unbelievable action shot; stunning shots of a coastline where fjord and mountain come together; and of course, the grand British Columbia ocean itself.  <br /> <br />This book is a real gem. It's crime more people haven't had a chance to go through it. Read it. Take your time, don't just skim through it and goggle over the pictures. Trust me, the time will be worth it, you'll be glad you did. A must-have for anyone who considers themselves an environmentalist, a nature lover, and especially for people who have stood in awe in a temperate rain forest and said \\"I need to know more.\\"	2005-07-18

I owned just about all of them - \\"Third Planet From Altair,\\" \\"Mystery of Chimney Rock,\\" \\"Ghost Hunter,\\" etc.  <br /> <br />This book is a funny and eminently readable parody of the \\"Choose Your Own Adventure\\" series. In order to really enjoy this books it helps if you read the series as a kid. It's hilarious because it's taken that series and given it an irreverent, perverted twist. I can tell the author, celebrated punk author Carlton Mellick III, probably grew up reading these books because he's got the tone of them down perfectly. Even the cover of the book looks like a knock-off of a Choose Your Own Adventure book! <br /> <br />As for the story, what can I say? It's irreverent, wacky, perverted fun. It's not deep literature, but it is a lot of fun, especially if you grew up with the series it's lampooning, then it becomes doubly interesting to see the series turned absolutely upside down. But even if you didn't have the good fortune to read these books as a kid, this book is a quick read and still worth it. For anyone who read the \\"Choose Your Own Adventure\\" series, it's a must read!	2005-07-16

Roebrt Aickman is best known as an early master of the pyschological supernatural-horror short story. Many authors have been influenced by Aickman's works, which feel much more contemporary than they really are due to their sometimes obscure, postmodern nature. For example, a story published in the 1970s, \\"The Hospice\\" reminds one of a Thomas Ligotti story. <br /> <br />But this book has nothing to do with subtle stories of pyschological horror - or perhaps it has everything to do with it, if you think about it. Truly though, this is a non-fiction piece of work, Aickman's own autobiography. <br /> <br />Aickman led something of an interesting life, and writes about interestingly, curiously, with something of a detached air, which lends a peculiar but effective tone to the book.  <br /> <br />Another interesting thing about this autobiography - the lack of explanation, or exposition. It appears his childhood was quite odd, with a number of bizarre events shaping it. These are never given any explanation; perhaps there are none. His father, for example, sounds like some comically tragic blackguard from a Charles Dickens novel. The reader begins to see where Aickman's penchant for pyschological, subtle horror and ambiguity without closure comes from in this book. <br /> <br />Perhaps the strongest point of his autobiography is maybe where Aickman loses some of his trademark detachment - his lovingly crafted portrait of pre-World War 2 London and environs, like the great country estate of his aunt and uncle that he so loved. His picture of a pre-War London makes you wish, even though it was a hard time, that you could see it yourself, through his eyes; effectively suffused with the intoxicating, golden hue of nostalgia, and wonderfully done. <br /> <br />What makes this book so interesting, to put it simply, is the portrait of a child and young man growing up in a time differently from our own, whose actions and situations we may not be able to fully grasp at first, penned by a man with a keen eye into the human condition and a gift for words. Recommended.	2005-07-16

If you've already read or have \\"The God Project\\" and get this book, it'll be the same thing. It is the same book, just with a different cover. There is additional or added text and no editorial changes. <br /> <br />John Saul is not one of my favorite authors. I liked him as a kid, but by the mid-90s as I got older I was disillusioned by the fact that he never seemed to change his style and his books were plagued by a predictable sameness, as well as a lot of padding. However \\"All Fall Down,\\" or \\"The God Project\\" as I will refer to it, is during Saul's heyday, while his books still felt fresh and innovative and his popularity was reaching its zenith. <br /> <br />It takes place in a small town, Eastbury, Massachusetts, which is stricken by an epidemic of SIDS in its seemingly healthy infants (also known as crib-death or Sudden Infant Death Syndrome). Children start to turn up missing as well. One woman, Sally Montgomery, refuses to believe the SIDS explanation peddled to her as the cause of death for her baby girl. The parents of these child begin to come together and find out rather some rather chilling medical data about their children and who has been monitoring them with interest. I can't really tell more without giving away some vital plot spoilers, but if you've never read John Saul before, this is as fair a place to start as any. It's one of his better novels, and not that typical - most of his novels revolved around small children and horrible, often supernatural-seeming happenings in small towns. <br /> <br />So I guess I'd recommend this book. Once you get past a certain point, it becomes fairly predictable, and in the 20+ years since it's been released there have been enough other books in this vein to give you an idea about what's going on, but it still packs a decent wallop.	2005-07-16
US	51009310	R37ZG3FJ8QVJI6	1857987594	846902375	Binary: "Leningrad Nights", "How the Other Half Lives" Bk.1 (GollanczF.)	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Another nice little work by Graham Joyce.	I like Graham Joyce. He writes dreamy, somewhat surreal and fantastic fiction that usually not overly cloying. His books are usually somewhat short, which them imminently digestible pieces of another time/place/state of mind; sharp and resonant pieces of work that never suffer from padding. Of course not all of his works are like this - the more serious \\"Smoking Poppy\\" which does not indulge in so many enjoyable flights of fancy like a \\"Tooth Fairy\\" or \\"Limits of Enchantment\\" is the exception more than the rule however.<br /><br />This short novella (under 100 pages) \\"Leningrad Nights\\" falls into the Graham Joyce mold squarely. Sometimes set in a foreign land from his own (he resides in England), in another time, it could be just more historical fiction, but he sets his own unique slight fantastical and whimsical spin upon it.<br /><br />\\"Leningrad Nights\\" is the tale of a young boy facing a battle for survival during the 900 day long German Siege of Leningrad from 1941-44. It tells his story of survival against a very well-illustrated portrait of a bitterly cold and war-torn city... indeed, the portrait of the city in the throes of war and siege are among the strongest descriptions of the book. But while war forces people to make harsh decisions, this novella may be regarded as not just a struggle for survival of body but for soul as well as the boy becomes the adoptive father of a prostitute's father.<br /><br />This is a short novella, so much is not as well developed as I would like, I could see this making an engrossing longer book, but it succeeds for what it is - an insightful, descriptive, and slightly turned account of events that we are lucky we only have to experience through Graham Joyce's lyrical prose.	2005-07-16
US	51009310	R2W3IIZZXQ07NX	0843954124	996157105	Flesh Gothic	Books	4	28	30	N	N	Gory, gruesome reading, a good time to be had by all.	Let me preface my review by saying I am not a big fan of Edward Lee. Not because he's a poor writer, or has no ear for word flow, but just because I'm not a fan of his over-the-top style of writing. In some of his books I've read, too often I've found the plots left unattended to so he could focus on his proclivity for tons of lust, sex, violence, and death. This can be interesting reading when interweaved with interesting plot elements (like in some of Robert Laymon's more graphic works) but just in my opinion I tend to find it too repetitive, uninteresting, and schlocky. <br /> <br />Now. That said, I came across this book, \\"Flesh Gothic,\\" and read the description, and decided to give it a try. I really like finding books that have a classic horror setup, I tend to like a well-written, entertaining, classic horror novel than one that sets out to spin the genre on its head and revolutionize everything while lacking a little in the raw entertainment end of it (like House of Leaves). \\"Flesh Gothic\\" promises that, and delivers.  <br /> <br />\\"Flesh Gothic\\" has a setup *very* much like Richard Matheson's classic horror novel \\"Hell House.\\" A 66 room haunted mansion that is the site of unbelievable depravity, with all the participants dead, except one, seemingly becomes the focus of a team investigators. Very much like Matheson's \\"Hell House,\\" a fantastic novel. It has a wonderful setup that immediately got me very interested and involved with the novel, and it contains a number of classic haunted house mysteries that beg discover. <br /> <br />A ways into the novel, however, it takes more of a fantastical turn reminscent of the author's \\"City Infernal.\\" While initially I wasn't that thrilled about the turn it took, as the book continued, it seemed in some way to mesh well with the beginning of the book after all. This is not \\"Hell House Redux,\\" although it may start out that way. As the investigators explore the house, it becomes less standard horror than \\"Hell House,\\"and more of, like I said, a surrealistic and sick tour de force of nightmarish imagery. However, it still stays true to classic horror in many ways. <br /> <br />To wrap this up, I would recommend this book. I'm not a big Edward Lee fan, but I enjoyed this novel. It was naughtily depraved like Lee always is, but not unbearably or boringly so. Lee doesn't cheat you on the ending, and he makes the most and expands upon a great formula. 4 stars, give it a read.	2005-07-16
US	51009310	R1QL018K8GYKSH	0374372780	320600529	Straydog	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A very fine read for young adults and those older.	You know, I'm not a big fan of Kathe Koja, despite having read most of her works. Her subject matter and writing style usually rub me the wrong way, like in &quot;Skin&quot; and &quot;Strange Angels,&quot; too books I very much disliked. However, &quot;Straydog&quot; is a much stronger and different work. <br />  <br /> Koja eschews her usual over-the-top melodrama for a more restrained tale that resonates very strongly in truth. 'Straydog&quot; is about a very cynical high school girl named Rachel who doesn't like much in life besides taking care of animals and writing. She isn't full of self-pity though, she's a sharply sarcastic and biting one, full of life. She meets a dog who animal officials at the shelter she works at declare is a lost cause, much too violent, but she is determined to rehabilitate it and upon the encouragement of her teacher, decides to write about the process through the dog's point of view. She also meets an outsider, a boy named Griffin, who helps her in this task. <br />  <br /> The whole &quot;story within a story&quot; aspect of this slim book works very well, and each level is written smartly and with a minimum of flashy, unnecessary pretenses by Koja. There are very smart viewpoint and tone changes from the book Koja is writing to when it becomes the passages that Koja is writing that Rachel is writing through the view of the dog. A very clean transition that makes the whole thing believable. <br />  <br /> To sum up my feelings, this book doesn't really hit any of the false notes that many of Koja's other works do, and I think it has something pretty useful to impart to all of its readers, not always the same for each reader. I would definitely recommend this book, it's a quick and smart read.	2004-08-06
US	51009310	R16K71O0GWLA0K	0374308497	190916823	The Blue Mirror	Books	4	5	7	N	N	A good urban fable... almost Gaiman-esque	...And &quot;Gaiman-esque&quot; is one of the highest praises I can offer up, though when I say &quot;almost&quot; I mean it - it's good, but it's not at Neil Gaiman's level of craft yet. <br />  <br /> I've read most of Kathe Koja's books, and when she's good, she's good (Cipher, Straydog) and when she's bad, she's very, very bad (Skin, Strange Angels).  <br />  <br /> This is Koja at her best again. There are actually a whole lot of things to dislike about this slim book, a lot of melodrama, rather pallid plot devices, and some moments of embarrassingly adolescent writing. But you know what? For some reason, none of that bothered me. <br />  <br /> &quot;Blue Mirror&quot; is about an artistic girl named Maggy who spends her free time sketching things at a downtown cafe. She is something of a loner and outsider, and sees the world in a way others do not and translates that vision to her art. She skips school frequently and has to take care of an alcoholic, emotionally adolescent-like mother in a slummy apartment. She escapes into her world of art to get away from her boring and pallid life. <br />  <br /> Her life takes a turn when she meets a strange and beautiful (the Japanese word &quot;bishounen&quot; comes to mind here) street kid named Cole who has near magical charm powers over girls. He has an entourage of followers, hangers-on, friends, named Jouly (nearly a child) and the punky, bitter Marianne. As she slowly assimilates herself into the trio, she finds out that Cole, and indeed a great many other things, are not what they seem. <br />  <br /> The setup of this urban fable is very much like some of Gaiman's Sandman stories, and the descriptions of Cole's otherworldy charm, city squalor, and street kids reminds me very strongly of Caitlin R. Kiernan's style. To me, this whole book has a fable-like, fantastic, dreamy sense to it, like it's portraying the real world but turned some degrees askew. We can all guess at how this story is going to turn out long before it reaches its conclusion, but this book is one that for me isn't about the ending, it's about the journey - how we got to the end. It gets high points on mood, ambiance, and pictoral visualization... you poke holes in this book all day long, the point I'm getting across that the flaws were not enough of a detraction for me, and this book succeeded on its own merits enough for me to award it a 4 star ranking.	2004-08-06
US	51009310	RVVOZL2V37JRA	0843948507	749306061	The Traveling Vampire Show	Books	5	2	4	N	N	King's &quot;It,&quot; and Simmons's &quot;Summer of Night&quot; - now this.	I would wholeheartedly add it to the pantheon of horror novels (headed up by the two fantastic aforementioned titles and Ray Bradbury's &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;) that can be classified as nostalgic horror coming-of-age books. Stephen King, while I don't like everything he does, writes these types of books better than anyone. &quot;It&quot; and &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; are the unquestionable high points of these styles of books (think of them as Wonder Years meets Fangoria). But we may add Richard Laymon's &quot;The Traveling Vampire Show&quot; to the list as a fine addition as well. <br />  <br /> This book has a lot of plotline similarities to &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; - a mysterious and sinister cheap sideshow carnival comes to town, and the kids have a coming-of-age experience because of it. However, the similarities end there. However, that's where the similarities end.  <br />  <br /> I found this to be quite a charming and evocative book. Dwight, Rusty, and Slim are sketched in fantastically by Laymon, this is, hands-on, the best and most truthful characterization of his career easily. There's a lot of sexual-hormoned-fueled description in this book, but considering we're getting the story from an adolescent boy during the summer while he's having a sexual awakening of sorts, it actually makes sense and works with the book much more than some of Laymon's more trashy sex-laden novels do. <br />  <br /> So what's the book about? You can read Amazon's description. The teens go to check out a carnival taking places in a mysterious area that's built up a bad history of its own. From there, a series of events unfold to make all of them have a growing-up experience. The writing is fantastic, I must say. Even though I wasn't even alive during the 1960s, nearly every word of this book rings true, lively and fresh and vibrant, bringing a by-gone era to life and characters long grown up rendered in their youth again.  <br />  <br /> People who complain that only 5% of the book actually takes place at the Traveling Vampire Show have totally missed the point. If this book actually spent more time at the Vampire Show, it would have been an inferior book. As it, it is hands down Laymon's most artful, subtle, and sophisticated work as an author. Kudos.	2004-08-06
US	51009310	R8QYWPL5XCQLN	0870540882	621234891	Necropolis	Books	5	20	21	N	N	English gaslight detective story with a gothic flair.	Today I've decided to go back and review some older, less-known books with gothic touches that have really appealed to me. Earlier I reviewed &quot;Carnacki the Ghost Finder&quot; by William Hope Hodgson, and &quot;The House of the Wolf&quot; by Basil Copper. This book, &quot;Necropolis&quot; fits in well with those two, and like them, is similarly sadly overlooked today.<br />&quot;Necropolis&quot; is set in the Romantic setting of Victorian gaslit London, the remarkable setting of Sherlock Holmes, Jack the Ripper, and (a bit earlier) Charles Dickens. What keeps readers and writers alike coming back to Victorian London? The fantastic energy of an old world capital at the height of the British empire? The cobbled streets and enveloping fog that creates such a lush mood of otherworldy mystery? There are a lot of factors, I suspect.<br />&quot;Necropolis&quot; make good use of the setting, and in fact draws largely on what was at the time (of its early 80s publishing), a largely overlooked piece of history. The book stars a private detective, equally hard-boiled in the modern way, but also Holmesian as well, named Clyde Beatty. He gets involved with some mysterious happenings at a necropolis (city of the dead) outside of London called Brookwood Cemetery. Brookwood Cemetery actually exists, it was built in 1854 as a cemetery that would hold the dead of London for centuries to come, and it was the biggest in the world. This cemetery had its own train station, for trains of the dead carrying only corpses would run to Brookwood to be buried within its vast confines. The mystery revolves around both the train of the dead and the gigantic Brookwood Cemetery.<br />If you think such things are ripe grounds for writing a gaslight mystery, you couldn't be more right. Even though 3/4 of the way through the book it comes to a rather generic conclusion, the strength of the book is its remarkable use of the historic and fascinating settings, and the eerie, gothic air that pervadesthe unraveling of the mystery.<br />So, if you're a fan of Victorian detective stories with gothic touches, then I cannot recommend this book enough.	2004-05-31

Much of my enjoyment of this book comes from my love of the classic, traditional Romantic-gothic, particularly those written or set in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This fantastic book by Basil Copper fits the bill *beautifully.*<br />A group of folklorists at a meeting in 19th century Hungary (we can assume in the Translyvania area as part of Transylvania is in Hungary) end up trapped inside the Homolky Castle due to weather, which stands menacingly above a village as you might imagine. The castle is appropriately huge and lonely, with many dark and unexplored passages. It's located in a forbidding landscape of forests and mountains. The Homolky clan is a bit strange and mysterious, but the clincher is that they and their castle have a history of being haunted by a werewolf. Indeed, as the folklorists stay on in the castle, it appears they are all being stalked, and gruesome murders turn up evidence pointing to the werewolf. Now one of the men has to get to the bottom of what's going on and unearth the secrets behind the hauntings and attacks.<br />It may sound like a cliched set-up, but that's the beauty - I love set-ups like these, but since they're seen as so cliched, it turns out there are very few serious books you can name that are structured in this way. It's a story in the vein of the classic gothic tales - late night supernatural encounters in the castle, shadowed castle corridors, a beautiful and haunted young woman in peril, mysterious murder, long-buried family secrets... this story has it all, and Basil Copper executes it in a flawlessly haunting and atmospheric way. <br />By now I think you should know whether this book is for you or not. It's intelligently written, and perhaps the cynics would call this book &quot;cheesy,&quot; but I am a big fan of the classic gothic atmosphere... frankly we need more books written for adults in which a character has to play supernatural detective in a forbidding 19th century castle. If you're a fan of this type of book, then I can't recommend it enough.	2004-05-30
US	51009310	R2043HT94QJAUD	1587155710	793612253	Carnacki the Ghost Finder	Books	5	16	16	N	N	Wow. Excellent classic gothic detective stories.	I read this books first years ago, and only now remembered it is most deserving of a great review. The best description I can give of the stories of Carnacki the Ghost Finder is that he investigates stories with some great, classic gothic set-ups. He's something like a Sherlock Holmes of the supernatural, a concept I absolutely adore. <br />What's even better is that these stories were written by William Hope Hodgson (much admired by H. P. Lovecraft) in the early part of the 20th century (around 1910), so it still has that incredible Victorian feeling of horror, shrouded in antiquity and mystery, with a fantastic and classically spooky atmosphere. Basically, for gothic gaslight ambience, this is one of the most satisfying books you can read. Since it was actually written so long ago, it has none of the modern contrivances you find in books written today set back in that time.<br />There are a couple of different versions of Carnacki the Ghost Finder. One has only 5 stories, some have 6, and some have 9. I've read both the 6 story and 9 story version; obviously you should try and procure the 9 story version, which adds The Hog, The Haunted Jarvee, and The Find. <br />Of the stories, all of them are great reading, but my favorites are &quot;The House Among the Laurels,&quot; one of the best haunted house short stories I've ever read, and the very Lovecraftian (though Hodgson pre-dates Lovecraft) &quot;The Whistling Room.&quot; Other good stories include &quot;The Gateway of the Monster&quot; in which Carnacki bites off more than he can chew in a demonic encounter; &quot;The Searcher of the End House,&quot; a frenetic search for the truth behind a ghost, and the unsettling &quot;The Hog,&quot; and the nicely done atmospherics of &quot;The Haunted Jarvee.&quot; <br />But the whole book is great. Check it out if you love that classic gothic atmosphere in your stories.	2004-05-30

I apologize, I cannot continue without prefacing my review without a word or two about this great man, and I am not normally effusive in my praise.<br />If you wanted someone to try and model your life on, you could do far worse than to choose Studs Terkel. Anyone today could live to be 200 and not see and experience half of what this man has. He was born May 14, 1912, and at the age of 91, he is still going strong. Talk about endurance, about transcending time. My hats off to Terkel.<br />Anyway, to the review, as you might expect if you've read anything else by Terkel, he continues his intriguing and beguiling brand of oral history, transmitted to us through the written word. His many works have touched on many periods, and many themes, but in this book, Terkel examines hope.<br />More importantly, Terkel in this book views hope as marked by resistance, activism, working to change the world or make it a better place. It is easy in these times to become dismissive... in an interview Terkel said before he wrote the book, he had the feeling that the nation was as apathetic and hopeless as it hadn't been in a long time. To some extent, that rings true. <br />But this book isn't just a foray into a depressing land with no hopes or prospects. Some of the military personnel have rather bleak things to say about the future, but despair is the flip side of the coin to hope - to talk about one without speaking about the other would be pointless. <br />The book's framework is this: Terkel examines how people have perservered, lived, strived, propsered, and died throughout recent American history. Famous people. Unknown people. People from all walks of life. Teachers, social workers, and politicians share the stage with unknown alcoholics, refugees, and disease victims. The results are not uniformly happy, but that is not important - the presence of hope in the face of what you would think of as unendurable odds is the theme. Hope, and its many forms - hope forlife, hope for happiness, hope for change, hope for sheer survival. <br />If I've made this book sound like some kind of &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul,&quot; let me assure you, it isn't. It isn't candy-coated, dumbed-down, or an overly cheery insult to your intelligent. It won't eradicate anyone's cynicism, but I have to think that most people would come away from reading this book feeling better about their country and its inhabitants than before they read it... coming away a little changed themselves as well. And really, what more can you ask for in a book?<br />I would heartily recommend this book to anyone.	2004-01-14

This isn't a novel, it's something of a travel guide, just in case anyone was still uncertain about this aspect. This is almost like William Burroughs' \\"Junky\\" being a guide to New York City in the 1940s, except it's not in a novel format. It's not your traditional Fodor's Guide to Nonsensical Travel, this is a pretty loose, irreverent, and different take on the city Palahniuk calls home, Portland, Oregon. This is almost like William Burroughs' \\"Junky\\" being a guide to New York City in the 1940s, except it's not in a novel format.<br />I like this book because it introduces you to a side of Portland that is not often seen or written about in mainstream and tells the reader about the oddball characters, bizarre happenings and goings on, and provides a guide to some irreverent, half-assed, and often fascinating landmarks that you wouldn't find elsewhere, including many places special to Palahniuk himself.<br />That said, Palahniuk is flat-out misrepresenting his city. I've been to Portland frequently, and while it is an interesting place, Palahniuk really hams up his prose and descriptions here to the point of being disingenuous. Palahniuk manages to make Portland out to be as addictively seedy as a 1980s-era Times Square, as full of creative miscreants as pre-tech boom San Francisco, and as gloriously full of bohemian life as 1920s Paris. This is simply not the case, Portland exists on a much smaller scale, as I'm certain its residents would attest to. It is somewhat disappointing to see Palahniuk shill so badly for his city as to distort matters this far... reading this one would think you're going to run into a mad drunken artist every moment. <br />I also have to question the wisdom of Palahniuk writing this novel. Since it has been published, Palahniuk has publicly bemoaned that some of what he has written about has disappeared, or even been changed by the attention he's brought. It seems rather blind of him not to have anticipated this... as it's been throughouttime with humanity, like in Alex Garland's fine novel \\"The Beach,\\" when you bring relatively unknown things to wider audience, often they are ruined or changed for the worse. <br />If my feelings about this book seem mixed, I can assure you - they are.	2003-12-07

Once again, Neil Gaiman has done it again, \\"it\\" being crafting an imminently readable and likeable book for all ages, from 6 to 60, as he did with \\"Stardust\\" and \\"Coraline.\\"<br />\\"The Wolves in the Walls\\" has that same eerie, disjointed, disquieting look that \\"Coraline\\" had, though not as powerfully as the latter work.  It is about a girl named Lucy, who lives in a lonely hill top house with her parents and brother.  One day she hears wolves in the walls, but no one believes her.  When the wolves do come out of the walls, her family has to decide how to deal with it.<br />Ostensibly a book geared toward younger readers, this book works on other levels for the critical, interested reader of all ages.  The illustrations by Dave McKean are very much sort of a dark collage, a collage by a madman.  Everything is rendered in geometric, shadowy disarray... the mundane becomes sinister, and pervasive throughout the book is a sense of subdued yet black surrealism, featuring angles and proportions of insanity, much like \\"Coraline.\\"  The book speaks to childhood fears through an adult milieu, while addressing adult fears in a more subdued manner.<br />While this book does not deliver the emotional punch or satisfaction of \\"Coraline\\" it is nonetheless a good book, one I highly recommend.  It also has a great sense of humor, rare for such a dark work -- who can not laugh at the mother who makes enough jam for an army, or the wolves \\"dancing their wolfish dances.\\"  Check it out.	2003-09-10

Too many people can't separate the ideas of \\"militant feminism\\" from De Beauvoir, and why this is, I can't understand.  De Beauvoir is hardly extreme or radical; she simply advocates equality between the sexes... and who among us doesn't?  How is this radical.<br />Anyway, to get to the book, this book is not like \\"All Men are Mortal\\" or \\"The Second Sex\\" in that, there is less advocation and pontificating going on here (this is a neutral judgment, by the way).  It is more straightforward fiction; I would liken it to a minimalization of Balzac's view for the French society:  It captures three woman in sharp, short snapshots at specific points in lives.  What comes of this?  Read and find out.	2002-04-15

Dragonlance has some huge hits and misses with their peripheral books that branch off and build on the myth of the original 1st Story Level of Dragonlance.  But I'd have to say this is a huge miss, which is surprising, because Chris Pierson's other books Spirit of the Wind and Dezra's Quest, were pretty good.  <br />This book, however, is moribund in pretty much every way.  It's not that it's *spectacularly* bad, it's just that it's so rote, so paint-by-numbers, that 80% of the people reading this review could have written a better account.  For some reason, a lot of Istar-era Dragonlance books seem to flop (like The Dark Queen, one of the worst Dragonlance books, for example).  <br />This book took place during a fascinating time, and chronicled the rise of the last Kingpriest during a tumultous era.  But the book isn't exciting at all.  It has no spark, no energy.  I like to get a sense of wonder and excitement when reading fantasy.  Not to be cruel, but this is like reading a bicycle assembly manual.  It's not horrible, it's just bland and dull, and evokes nothing from the reader.  With all the other great books out there to read, I would avoid this one.	2002-04-04

His recent works, like &quot;48&quot; and &quot;Others&quot; have all been pretty moribund dredges when compared to his older material, like &quot;Fog,&quot; &quot;Rats,&quot; &quot;Ghosts of Sleath,&quot; &quot;The Haunting,&quot; or &quot;Moon.&quot;  <br />This book has the dashed-off, unpolished, pulpy feel of a John Saul novel, or dare I say... R. L. Stine?  Horror authors have gotten seemingly lazy lately, thinking that by adding straight out old-school supernatural horror with pyschological complexities,  you automatically have yourself a winner of a novel.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.<br />Anyway, Kindred returns to his old brooding house (Gods, is this an overused plotline).  Once there he finds his heritage is not what it seems (another old gimmick, this was a favorite's of H.P. Lovecraft).  There's some saucy dialogue and spicy scenes between him and a faerie... but eh, what's the use?  This book is rote, run-of-the-mill, and you could see every &quot;twist&quot; (I use the word lightly) from a mile away.  <br />It is competently written, however.  But with all the great books out there to read, I simply can't recommend this one, even to Herbert enthusiasts.	2002-04-02

I know since everyone else gave this book 5 stars and I'm given it 1, I'm going to get a lot of unhelpful votes, but be that as it may, I feel like I should offer my opinion on this book.  By the way, this book did not shock or &quot;horrify&quot; me.<br />The back cover of it sounding pretty good, but upon reading and completing the book I was extremely disappointed.  This book is filled with ridiculously trite cliches, and the writing is simply abominable.  I think this book is trying to make a hero of the killer, because all the men she kills and tortures are complete and utter slime.  I find it interesting that she never once happened to take home a genuinely nice guy, that all the charming men she picks up in the bars all happen to turn out to be scum-of-the-world evil.<br />Aside from that, we have our usual cast of idiots.  The flaky poet type is lampooned, the feminist woman who's the victim of a child molester who is typically paint-by-numbers, another atypical molestation victim who calls out for &quot;Daddy&quot; every two seconds, and a tough, gritty cop.  Why is it that every book that has a girl molested by her father must repeat the phrase &quot;Daddy&quot; incessantly?  It's a cheap, mawkish, and maudlin way to underscore the idea of innocence lost.<br />The book tries to put a spin on the tough-as-nails cop by making him gay, but this seems more like an afterthought than anything.  And nothing can save the plot, which is predictable.<br />The writing is the worst part.  Not to be mean, because I know writing is difficult, the way this book is put out and paced reminds me of an R. L. Stine book.  It's a pretty immature work.<br />On the upside, the best character is a pimp whose character may throw you a curveball.<br />My recommendation is to not read this book.	2001-11-11

If you read my review of &quot;Dragons of a Fallen Sun&quot; you know what I thought was lacking in it:  a bit sparse on plot and weak characters you couldn't identify with.<br />I am pleased to admit that &quot;Dragons of a Lost Star&quot; has thoroughly exceeded my expectations.  Not only are the old characters (Tas, Goldmoon) written better in this book (In Fallen Sun, they seemed strangely unlikeable) the new characters, like Mina and Silvanoshei become more fleshed out and appealing (though not Gilthas.  I fear poor Gilthas is doomed to remain a static character for the rest of eternity).<br />Without giving away any spoilers (when people give away spoilers in Amazon.com reviews it just irritates me like all hell) I thought the scenes with Mina, her followers, and the One-God were done much better than in the first book.  In the first book, the only event that provided any dynamic was her meeting with Mirror.  In this book, the reader sees more than simpy &quot;Ah Mina!  I worship you and the One-God!&quot;  To cut it short, it's less religious-fanaticism-by-the-numbers than the first book.<br />We get to see more about Tasslehoff and Goldmoon, and Goldmoon's big secret and mystery, which I was expecting to be a letdown, was rather interesting, if not entirely original.  <br />But for those of you who seek action, the wars with the elves are good... but not Hickman-Weis great in my opinion.  Beryl and Qualinost does not measure up to, say, The Attack on Neraka in Spring Dawning, or the High Clerist Tower's Final Stand in Summer Flame.  But it does nicely change the pace of the book from early on.  The real strength of this book lies with Mina, Tasslehoff, Goldmoon, Silvanoshei... and a few others who I may not name.<br />If you're still doubting whether you should read this book, I have one more thing to remind you of:  <br />What about Dalamar?	2001-05-27

Even better than &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; is my opinion.  It has &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;'s nightmarish imagery and makes use of the same cut-up technique, but the plot is a lot more involving and coherent than NL's dissonace.<br />The plot is basically about a group of &quot;Wild Boys&quot; who live at the fringes of society, and, (perhaps anticipating Fight Club) live to cause chaos on the all-too strictly regimented world of order.  Burroughs' chronicles the lives of the Wild Boys, and many of their homosexual escapades, so if you are uneasy about reading homosexual scenes, this book is definitely not for you.<br />At times downright explicit, Burroughs does provide a stunning vision of a nightmarish future where the only people with true freedom will be those runaways, those &quot;wild boys&quot; who live on the cusp of society.	2001-05-12

Chicago may have changed a lot since Upton Sinclair penned this novel about worker exploitation at the turn of the century, but in many ways it has not changed.  The exploitation is still there, it simply has a new face.<br />&quot;The Jungle&quot; is a touching and tragic a book about the exploitation of immigrant workers in the meat-packing industry in Chicago.  The protagonist of the story is a never-say-die type of fellow throughout the story, but even he cannot defeat the forces allied against him.  This tale was so revolutionary new laws were passed to abolish the sort of foul practices that will touch your heart.	2001-05-12

That's one of the few reasons you should read this book.  Because I have a major problem with this book.  No, it's not that I find it shocking and sickening; obviously I would have stayed away, no one finds De Sade by &quot;accident.&quot;  No, I find his philosophies are what makes this book so unlikeable.  I do not mind I find them horrid, revolting, or disgusting.  What I mean is I find them trite, immature, and poorly thought out.  De Sade spends ten pages re-iterating the same things over and over; basically, he states in ten pages what he could easily say in one.<br />Now, this alone does not make me dislike this book.  After all, sometimes it's talent to use ten pages to say what you could in one, correct?  The whole &quot;Henry James vs. Ernest Hemingway&quot; ideal, right?  Yes, but the mawkish tone de Sade assumes throughout this narrative sounds gleefully like he's scandalizing you the whole way, when he is not.  <br />Plus, the plot is little more than an excuse to throw people together for sex scenes that aren't even all that interesting.<br />If you want a more interesting book about historical sadism, try reading about Elizabeth Bathory.  I don't believe she needed to try and justify what she did with pretentious philosophical rubbish with rife with illogical loopholes you could drive a bus through.	2001-05-11

I've read all of Dostoyevsky's books, and I like six of his works better than this one.  That isn't to say that this is a bad work, it simply shows how talented of a writer he is.<br />This book is a semi-autobiographical piece about the time Dostoyevesky spent in a Siberian prison.  Here he relates to the dehumanizing, deadening effects of the modern prison system and invokes his philosophies of better ways of treating and rehabilitating prisoners.  He sketches detailed characters, and builds largely on the dichotomy between the &quot;common crook&quot; and the &quot;gentleman lawbreaker,&quot; the latter which is represented by him, and also the minority in the prison.<br />All in all, quite a good piece.	2001-05-09

Most people did not like this work by Herman Melville.  It certainly did not garner the attention that &quot;Moby Dick,&quot; &quot;Billy Budd,&quot; or &quot;Typee&quot; did.  &quot;Pierre&quot; is a startingly original work, about a young man who is lost through his subsconscious illicit love for his sister and his desire to the right thing.<br />The characterizations in this subtle, dense work are nothing short of amazing.  My favorite character was Pierre's sister.  Is she an innocent, wracked with guilt and sorrow over the misfortunes and injustices the world has foisted upon her?  Or is she an amoral Siren...determined to wreck Pierre's life?  A truly compelling character, and no one can say either characterization fits entirely without its flaws.<br />The premise of the story is this:  All is going right with Pierre's life.  He has financial security, and a beautiful fiancee.  All this changes when Pierre finds out he has an illegitmate sister who has been shunned by society and cast out.  He contacts her and tries to use his own position to help her, but ends up dragged into the depths of human misery himself.<br />Permeating this narrative throughout is the spectre of incest... what does Pierre actually FEEL for this sister of his?<br />A very provocative tale.	2001-05-09

Never before in my life have I read a book so gripping, so compelling, with such lively, vivid, and insightful characterizations.  &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; and &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; are excellent yes, but I consider &quot;Devils&quot; to be Dostoevsky's masterpiece.<br />Where to begin?  The book is about many things, but it is not easy to just pin down one specific thing it's about.  It's about the lives of many people in a typical Russian town of the time, and how these lives are affected by a few newcomers and a secret &quot;society&quot; that may or may not exist.<br />Among the wonderful characters are the perpetually nervous and harried Stephan Trofimovich, who feuds constantly with the shrewish Varvara Petrovna.  Nikolai Stavrogin is the hero of the book, a most Byronic hero:  tortured by a checkered past, mentally unstable, intelligent, cunning, and very dashing.  But you cannot predict this character's actions with any reasonable accuracy.  Peter Stepanovich is such a sly, cunning, and devious villain that he could could give Iago &quot;evil lessons&quot; for lack of a better way of putting it at the moment.  And Marya Timofeyevna, the mentally ill cripple with the heart of gold who holds secrets of her own, what of her?<br />And that's just a few of the marvelous characters that make up this book.  But not only is this book intellectually stimulating, it is hilarious as well.  From juvenile pranks conducted by the society, from black, absurd social commentary and humour, to the unflattering cariactures painted of (contemporary author of the time) Turgenev by Dostoevsky, &quot;Devils&quot; quite literally had my sides aching from laughter.<br />Read this book.  It may take a while to get into, but once you do, you'll be glad you did.	2001-05-09

Thomas Mann is an excellent author, but if you've never read anything by him before, begin with &quot;Magic Mountain&quot; and &quot;Death in Venice,&quot; followed by &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; and &quot;Felix Krull&quot; before tackling this book. This is Mann's second novel and a bit of a letdown from &quot;Buddenbrooks.&quot;  Mann uses the literary technique he would later exploit in such marvelous fashion with &quot;Magic Mountain&quot; -- that is, examining a small, isolated part of society as a microcosm of the larger whole, namely Europe.<br />Without giving away any of the surprises, this book is about a rather idealistic female's impact on a small village.  Mann poses thoughtful questions about the usefulness of artistic values in a bourgeois society while revealing the inner nuances of his characters as he does so artfully, as in &quot;Buddenbrooks&quot; and &quot;Felix Krull.&quot;<br />To top it all off, this Mann novel is probably his most humorous.  For those not knowledgable on Mann, he is not readily identifyable for the humour in his works, making this one rather noteworthy.	2001-05-03
US	51009310	R3M17FWETPB7X2	0679720200	882163178	The Stranger	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Life-changing work.	The Stranger changed my worldview (Weltschauen?) by changing me. <br />If you'd care to analyze Mersault with me for a second, you'll notice that one of his main characteristics is that he doesn't care what other people think of him. His thoughts and actions are not dictated by the reactions it may elicit from those around him. Also, he is completely honest with himself and doesn't delude himself into thinking that he feels emotions which are actually not forthcoming. For example he doesn't either mourn or pretend to mourn at his mother's funeral. It may make other people think of him as a cold, uncaring person, but as far as he's concerned, at least in my opinion, she died when they stopped seeing each other. <br />What Mersault does care about is experiencing the simple pleasures in life, and, in the process, fulfills whatever mundane obligations are necessary to for him to survive in either a civilized bourgeouis society or a jail. In other words, if you let him live life as he sees fit, he won't cause any trouble and will even help you when he feels it is necessary to do so. When unavoidable constraints are placed upon him, such as not being able to smoke in jail, he acclimates himself to the constraints and goes on experiencing whatever simple pleasures are possible in a jail cell. However, if cause him trouble for no reason or try to convert him to your way of living or thinking, he'll defend himself and take the offensive when the opportunity arises. Mersault does what he wants. If you deliberately try to get in his way, watch out.<br />What I'm trying to say here is that Mersault was as free as any human could possibly be. He viewed the world something he could enjoy living in no matter what conditions he was living under. If other people didn't like him for it, so what. Life was made to be enjoyed, not worried or mourned over.<br />So, in conclusion, I guess it changed my world view by giving me a philosophy of how to live my life in it.	2001-05-01

The man character, a peasant fisherman, is written as simple, old-fashioned, and quaintly charming in an adroit manner that is neither stupid nor cliched.  <br />His battles with the sea seem very realistic.  The story is basically a parable, man vs. the world.  The old man is happy, he has led a good life, and he has found a struggle worth giving his life up for:  perhaps the biggest fish ever caught.  <br />Unlike other ethnocentric Hemingway works, Hemingway shows a more deft sensitivity here, even deigning to give the fish a soul, if you can believe such a thing.<br />Check this one out.

It features an enterprising, stubborn, white-collar protagonist facing insurmountable obstacles who lacks the introspection to see he is a playing a game he cannot win.<br />&quot;The Castle&quot; is about Joseph K., a Land Surveyor, who comes to the village under a reign of... well, not terror, perhaps bumbling indifference, by the imposing symbol of absurd beauracracy, The Castle.  The Castle assigns inept assistants to Joseph, does not allow him to contact them, and worse yet, does not even give him a job, but tells him to &quot;Keep up the good work.&quot;<br />Along the way, Joseph makes the acquaintance of a mysteriously shunned family, takes on a fiancee who may or may not be all that she appears, and encounters a menagerie of cryptic, esoteric characters -- all of whom have their own ideas about the Castle and its vague, shadowy inhabitants.<br />This is a pretty effective treatise on beauracracy and the frustration of the common person of working hard and getting ahead.  But be forewarned:  the ending is imminently unsatisfied. Also be certain to try and find a Max Brod translation if possible.  The difference is very notable.	2001-05-01

I couldn't help but be disappointed by this book.  Perhaps a little background on myself is in order:  of every long-spanning fantasy series, Dragonlance has always been the one I've felt was most sacred.  I could never completely &quot;grok&quot; the slightly juvenile feel of the worlds evoked by Mercedes Lackey, Eddings, or Salvatore.  And the complex, disconnected worlds of Zelzany's &quot;Amber&quot; often left me cold.  For me, Dragonlance has always been the perfect balance of maturity (re:  not insulting your intelligence quite as often as other fantasy books do) and good old-fashioned sword-and-sorcery fun and epic swagger.  <br />While Dragons of a Fallen Sun is a welcome relief from Rabe's 5th Age work (not horrible work, but nothing special, either)Weis &amp; Hickman fail, for the first time ever, to evoke that special sense of magic and wonder that keeps me coming back again and again to their special blend of fantasy.<br />I remember the joys I had reading the Death Gate Cycles, Rose of the Prophet, and the Darksword.  I remember the breathless fascination in which I read the strongly evocative Star of the Guardians series.<br />None of this was present; on both this work and the Starshield novels, the duo feel like they've lost a step.<br />One of the biggest problems is I can't seem to fully empathize with the newer characters the way I did with Tanis, Flint, Raistlin, Caramon, or even Palin and Steel Brightblade.  I mean, how many of us felt like we knew Dragonlance characters better than many people in real life?  Mina and the like don't evoke that for me.<br />I apologize if this review was not helpful.  I suppose I have delineated very well what this novel is lacking.  But that's because I myself am not certain exactly what magical element this book is missing.  It is certain not cheap, shoddy writing at all.  The political intrigue, as always, is top notch.  But the intangibles... ah, I do not know.  Perhaps if the Gods have left Krynn, so too has the muse left W &amp; H.	2001-03-10

Dostoyevsky is one of my favorite authors; that is why it saddens me to see the way people overlook this book in a way they don't with Crime and Punishment, or Brothers Karamazov (or, dare I say, even The Idiot?!)<br />I will say something that perhaps has not been uttered often about this book:  It made me laugh out loud.  Probably because the main character of the book had some frighteningly similar thoughts to my own.<br />This book reads like a window into a man's soul.  He is torn apart by absurdist notions, and a desire to remain artistically and intellectual pure, fearing the &quot;taint&quot; of outside ideas.  <br />To put it shortly, this book is like watching a man pacing back and forth in his home, expounding on every little nuance of life that bothers, confounds, baffles, annoys, or perversely amuses him.<br />This may sound boring; however, it is entertaining and enlightening.  Imagine the man doing this raving to be an extremely witty (we're talking wittier than Oscar Wilde or Samuel Johnson -- THAT witty) individual, of great intellectual capacity, strong (often misdirected) passion, and a depth and breadth in reading not seen in today's society (through the necessary constraints of modern society, I would argue; please do not read my comment as a misanthropic statement on the ills of modern society, for I have no such notions) and you find you don't have a book that is boring at all -- you have a book so gripping, so outrageously entertaining, above all else, you don't even realize this fellow (who I imagine in my mind to madly gesticulate) has sucked you into his own demented little &quot;box&quot; of a world.  Step inside, especially if you're familiar with Dostoyevsky's other work, or that of Camus or Kafka.	2001-03-10

Many of the reviews on this book complain that it is &quot;too cynical.&quot;  I find this to be a ridiculous criticism of a book.  This is the same sort of nonsensical flagellating that Thomas Hardy once said &quot;cured him of novel-writing&quot; (Hardy certainly being accused of, among other things, too cynical).  <br />But I'm not out to write a review of other reviews, but of this book.  Donaldson's universe is not as deep or compelling as say, Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman's Starshield Universe, or their delightful space-operatic setting of the Star of the Guardians trilogy, or even the relatively sparse celestial settings of some of Harlan Ellison's sci-fi work.  I don't think by this point in the series Donaldson is working on sweeping us away in typical space-opera grandiosity (be forewarned if this is what you seek -- you will not find a classically defined &quot;epic&quot; in this story.)<br />What you will find is a compact, tightly written, and disturbingly personal piece of fiction.  If you're an empathetic person you'll be able to relate to even the monstrous Angus is some detached way.  There are no heroes in this story, and if you consider it, no true villains.  The story is about a kidnapping, but the simplicity ends there.<br />Yet, I have to admit, I would have preferred the epic sci-fi sweep of the aforementioned authors in places opposed to the personal, introspective (and often) slow-paced tone of this novel.  Give it a try, it only takes you about 4 hours to read.	2001-03-09

I had one problem with the book:  the  premise that the 100 year old crippled crazy man could go around and kick  the football players' (expletives).	1999-09-17

Worst thing was the cover of the old PBK I read	Robert McCammon is a pretty good author, I like him better than Stephen King, Ramsey Campbell, or Whitley Strieber, but less than James Herbert, Lovecraft, or Kim Newman.  &quot;Stinger&quot; is probably his best works,  take my word on this and ignore all of those &quot;Swan Song&quot;  sycophants.  &quot;Swan Song&quot; is ridiculous trash compared to this;  Usher's Passing is no match for the unique powers of this tale either.   Certainly the ludicrous pulp garbage of &quot;Bethany's Sin&quot; or the  egregiously bad &quot;Wolf's Hour,&quot; hardly even resemble the author  who wrote such a great novel as &quot;Stinger.&quot;  If you are going to  check out McCammon, check out &quot;Usher's Passing,&quot; and &quot;They  Thirst,&quot; but most of all, check out &quot;Stinger.&quot;  It reminds  me a little bit of two low-budget movies I saw-- &quot;Tremors&quot; and  this other movie about little balls that shoot spikes and the alien  hunters.  This book does not have alien balls that shook spikes, but rather  the poignant story of a dead end town torn apart by gangs would be gripping  enough, but then they throw in two alien life forms, one unbelievably  malevolent, the other, scared and in possession of a little girl's body.   Check this book out, it is great, ignore the corny cover!	1999-06-23

This was not the first &quot;Three Investigators&quot; book I read.  The first was back in 1983, when I was ten years old, &quot;Mystery of the Scar-Faced Beggar,&quot; which seemed to me at the time to be a wonderfully  complex political thriller.  My all-time faves of the series are, for  anyone who cares, Terror Castle, Fiery Eye, Creepshow Horrors, Wrecking  Rock, Stuttering Parrot, Whispering Mummy, and geez, there are so many now  that I think of them!  My least favorites were the Breathing Dragon one,  the Silver Spider was terrible, and the Magic Circle and Flaming  Footprints.   But about this book.  It is a fantastic, haunted house book!  Wondrous, glorious, the spectral fog, the Blue Phantom, this one is my  favorite 3 Investigator books!  Yeah!  Read it, just for silly fun if you  are skeptical!	1999-06-17
US	51009310	R1RMFDXR9AOI4Q	0312850832	374940595	Voices of Doom	Books	3	4	4	N	N	Some good some bad	Voices of Doom is a collection of short stories, with the near-entire book of &quot;From Evil's Pillow&quot; within it.  Some of the stories are simply sentimental jaunts, like &quot;Charon&quot; or the paranoid retiree  &quot;A Very Pleasant Fellow.&quot;  &quot;The Stranger&quot; is basically  Kafka.  You only get a few stories that are the real prime of the book,  which is classic horror in the Bloch/Lovecraft vein.  <br />&quot;The House on  the Tarn&quot; sets the mood nicely and has things going nicely up until  the end-- and you feel jilted by the unsatisfying ending.   Aickman-ish.<br />The two best stories are the riveting &quot;The  Gossips&quot; which is probably one of the top 30 horror short stories I  have ever read.  It is about ghastly statues and the horror the befalls the  scholars that venture about it.  A rather weak plot, but it is brilliantly  told.<br />&quot;The Grey House&quot; has an even weaker plot that borders on  collapse with its characters that act ridiculously foolish;  nevertheless  it is well told.<br />Overall, the striking horror elements of this book are  good, but you don't need to read it unless you have an abundance of time on  your hands.	1999-05-12
US	51009310	R3V8PAZSAA65RF	0870541560	556582656	A Rendezvous in Averoigne: The Best Fantastic Tales of Clark Ashton Smith	Books	3	22	31	N	N	Good language, poor plots at times	Well I wrote another, better review of this book, but it was over 1,000 words and subsequently not accepted.  <br />CAS is one of the authors of the Lovecraft circle in 1930s on, along with people like Frank Belnap, Donald  Wandrei, Robert Bloch, August Derleth, Lin Carter, etc.  Smith is a better  writer than Derleth, but, like Derleth, he doesn't always have the plots to  match the moods.  Stories like &quot;Necromancy in Naat&quot; and  &quot;Vaults of Yoh-Vombis&quot; have the atmosphere down pat, but poor  plots.  Some stories survive on their fantastic language alone.  &quot;A  Rendezvous in Averoigne&quot; is a fairly straightforward vampire horror  story, but the language is simply stunning, evocative, powerful, ethereal.   Wow.  Other stories like &quot;The Charnel God,&quot; &quot;City of Singing  Flame,&quot; and &quot;Genius Loci,&quot; are remarkable for their unique  concepts on death and interrment, science-fiction wondrement, and  Lovecraft-inspired spiral into otherwordly madness, respectively.  Smith  even manages to eke out a contemporary lamia story that is wonderful, the  last tale of the book.  Alas, for all of these great success, Smith makes  rudimentary mistake upon rudimentary mistake.  Sometimes his writings take  on the juvenality of a 6th grader with a pulp mag in one hand and a  thesauras in the other. About 70% of his stories are junk, but the other  30% are very good.  Give it a try, but be prepared for a tough time reading  it cover to cover (like I did.)  Avoid &quot;Chains of A___________&quot;  at all cost. What a terrible story	1999-05-12
US	51009310	R18SUU1VAWFT69	0684159996	198444855	Painted Devils: Strange stories	Books	3	6	23	N	N	Decent or good but not great-- Start with Wine Dark Sea	Well &quot;Painted Devils&quot; by our esoteric British gentlefriend Robert Aickman is one of his stronger                      works. It is not so good as &quot;Wine-Dark Sea,&quot; but however, this cannot be a fair  comparison as the                      &quot;Wine-Dark Sea&quot; is a  collection of previous works, selecting many of the strongest. However, it  is                      better than his most famous work, &quot;Cold Hand  in Mine,&quot; easily, I believe.<br />                     If you are looking  for an author to scare you out of your wits through pyschological terror,  outre'                      supernatural manifestation, or otherwise gothic  elements, Aickman is probably not your man, I fear.                       Some of your stories just aren't worth your (or anyone's, for that matter)  time. I will recommend                      which stories you should bother  to read however. Be advised that they are all abstruse, deliberate,                       and none of them have a powerful ending, just &quot;an  end.&quot; &quot;Houses of the Russians&quot; is the best among                       a decent but unimpressive lot. I won't attempt to describe this  one, it is better to just sit down and                      read it;  however it takes a great beginning and middle, but does not follow it up to  NEARLY as                      powerful a conclusion as could be.  &quot;Ringing in the Changes&quot; is unique and keeps your interest long                       enough with its various mysteries, and the ending is  probably the most interesting of all the stories in                       the book. &quot;The Waiting Room&quot; is typical fodder of Aickman's  lesser work, and I did not care for                      this dull piece at  all. &quot;The View&quot; while hardly horrifying, probably takes the  &quot;second best&quot; prize. No                      Stephen King, H. P.  Lovecraft, or Ramsey Campbell here, folks	1999-05-07
