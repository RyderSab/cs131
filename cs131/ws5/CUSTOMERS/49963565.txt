I had waited impatiently for many years for someone to tackle a complete history of one of my favorite bands, Jefferson Airplane, and when I finally saw the book in my local store, and then the author's name on the book itself, I knew right away that all would be well. I had enjoyed Jeff Tamarkin's wonderfully well-written, impeccably researched, enthusiastic and informative liner notes for various Airplane and Hot Tuna CDs for quite a while, and sensed that he was the perfect man to handle this job. Happily, that indeed turns out to be the case, and his Airplane history, \\"Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane,\\" featuring all those qualities that made his liner notes such a joy, is the volume that I and many others had been waiting for. Tamarkin not only gives us a thorough history of this seminal San Francisco group--starting in 1965, when Marty Balin (nee Martyn Buchwald) decided to put a new kind of band together--but also follows it through its dissolution in 1972 and on to its various offshoots (Jefferson Starship, Hot Tuna, KBC Band, etc.). Covering the pre-hippy days of the mid-'60s, through the Nixonian years and right on to J.A.'s reunion in 1989, Tamarkin also gives us a concise primer of a fascinating period of recent history. The book is replete with details of the band's principals but not exhaustingly so; that is, it never gets bogged down with excess back story, but rather gives us all the info we need to understand all the band members as fully fleshed-out people, limiting their back biographies to quick 10-page chapters. I have been a fan of Marty Balin, Paul Kantner, Grace Slick, Spencer Dryden and especially Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady for almost 40 years now, and still found an incredible amount of unknown information about them in this fast-moving history. (Spencer Dryden was Charlie Chaplin's nephew?!?! Who knew?) With chapters arranged in cliffhanger fashion, with a fascinating cast of characters and with many astounding stories, this book really does pull a reader in. And yet, Tamarkin does not yield to the temptation to sensationalize his tale. Indeed, to his credit, he admits right up front that there remain many \\"Airplane mysteries,\\" and lets it go at that. Yes, there are many juicy stories (I love the one about Jack sitting in the mud puddle on DMT, and Grace's escapades in Germany...not to mention that Reality D. Blipcrotch episode!), but many readers, I suspect, will be surprised that this book remains fairly levelheaded, with a minimum of wild sex and drug anecdotes. The anecdotes ARE there, but only enough to give us a feel for the time, place and characters. (One gets the feeling that Tamarkin could regale us with even juicier tidbits over a few drinks one evening.) The author has been given access to virtually every principal character in the Jefferson Airplane story, and the hundreds of hours of insider interviews have helped make this history practically definitive. <br />    On another note, I myself work as a copy editor and proofreader, and thus am happy to report that the book has also been put together virtually faultlessly. I only counted four typos in its entire 400+-page length, and all those were of the punctuational variety. The rare photographs on display are truly special (I just love the one of Jorma in his Cub Scout uniform!), and the book's index is perfectly composed and quite handy when keeping track of the history's large cast of characters. If there is one complaint that I would lodge--and it is a very minor one--it is that in the book's final third, more space has been given over to the exploits of Jefferson Starship than Hot Tuna. As a fan who has seen Tuna some hundred times in concert at this point, but who has never had much use for post-\\"Dragonfly\\" Starship, I would have wished for a little more parity here, but I suppose it could be argued that Starship was composed of more JA members than was Tuna, so I'm willing to let the point slide. Besides, this is a mere personal quibble. The fact remains, Jeff Tamarkin has done all fans of Jefferson Airplane a tremendous service with his wonderful book. I have read it twice already, and will surely refer to it often in the years to come. Thanks, Jeff!	2005-09-27

Well, I've never forgotten that conversation, and had long been meaning to ascertain whether or not this woman was right. It took me almost 20 years to get around to this book, but having just finished \\"Bill, the Galactic Hero,\\" I must say that, well, it IS very amusing indeed. In it, we meet Bill (no last name is ever provided), a simple farm lad on Phigerinadon II, who is shanghaied into the galactic emperor's army to fight in the war against the lizardlike Chingers. And what a grueling odyssey Bill goes through before all is said and done! He experiences a boot camp from hell, serves aboard the starship Christine Keeler and is almost killed, gets lost on the planetwide city of Helior, becomes a sanitation man, a revolutionary, a spy, fights on a swamp planet that's almost as nasty as Harrison's original Deathworld, and on and on. Harrison keeps this short novel moving along furiously, and the level of invention is very high throughout. It is most impressive how just about every page features some amusing incident, laff-out-loud line (and I am not an easy person to make laugh out loud) or imaginative detail. The story is a very violent one, a scathing commentary on the madness that is war and the crazy institution that is the military, and part of the story's humor comes from the joking, nonchalant manner in which horrible proceedings are described. But there is much that is just inherently flat-out funny: The characters drink Heroin Cola and eat chlora-fillies (part chlorophyll, part horse wieners). There's a rock band called The Coleoptera (beetles). The combatants use flintlock ray guns. There is a Robot Underground Resistance (RUR!), and some characters are named Schmutzig von Dreck (I guess it helps if you know some Yiddish), Gill O'Teen and EagerBeager. Still, as I said, this is a brutal tale, and the reader would be well advised not to grow too attached to any character, as at least half the cast gets offed before the book is through. And that brutalization extends to our main man Bill, who becomes less naive and more animallike as the novel proceeds. This is a tale told with almost Alfred Bester-like panache and marvelous satiric detail, but at times the detail is a bit sketchy; I'm referring to details of geography here, and background history and character. With so many incidents to cram into the book's short length, many of them seem a bit rushed, and characters come and go without leaving much of an impression. I suppose what I'm saying is that Harrison might have expanded his book a bit; that it's almost too concise and to the point. Still, the story certainly does entertain. But getting back to that woman in the bookstore...IS this the funniest book that I've ever read? Well, I must admit that no book has ever made me laff more than John Kennedy Toole's \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" (1980), and that Kurt Vonnegut's \\"The Sirens of Titan\\" (1959) may be a worthier sci-fi comedy than this one, but \\"Bill...\\" certainly does hold its own in that august company. After all, any book that provides big laffs and a positive message isn't to be sneezed at...	2005-08-09

RIDER HAGGARD	Sir Henry Rider Haggard, the so-called \\"Father of the Lost Race Novel,\\" didn't write such stories featuring only Allan Quatermain and Ayesha, She Who Must Be Obeyed. For example, his 17th novel, \\"The People of the Mist\\" (1894), is a smashing, wonderfully exciting, stand-alone lost-race tale featuring all-new characters. But the first third of the novel is hardly a lost-race story at all, but rather one of hard-bitten African adventure. In it, we meet Leonard Outram, a penniless British adventurer who is seeking wealth in the wilds of the \\"Dark Continent\\" after losing his family lands and estates (through no fault of his own, it should be added). He becomes involved in the rescue of a young Portuguese woman from the largest slaving camp in Africa, and this thrilling and quite suspenseful section of the book offers more entertainment value than most entire novels. But it is only after Leonard and Otter (his four-foot-tall Zulu sidekick) rescue Juanna Rodd that the book really takes off, and the hunt for the People of the Mist, and their legendary jewel horde, begins. Once the lost race has been discovered, Leonard & Co. become embroiled in a plot involving the impersonation of gods and priest vs. king politics, and Haggard throws in some violent sacrifices, a giant crocodile god, a \\"toboggan\\" escape along a precipitous glacier, some romances and a good deal of humor (thanks to that wonderful Otter character) to keep the reader consistently amused. The theology of this lost race is nicely detailed and, as is fortunately common in a Haggard tale, the author offers many commentaries on the side regarding his philosophies of life. For those readers who have enjoyed other tales by Sir Henry (I've read 30 or so at this point; the man CAN prove addictive!), \\"The People of the Mist\\" will resonate all over the place, bringing to mind both earlier and later Haggard works. For example, the character of Soa (Juanna's insanely jealous nursemaid) is similar to Hendrika the Baboon Woman in \\"Allan's Wife\\" (1889). Otter himself is a precursor of Quatermain's Hottentot sidekick Hans, especially when he attempts to fight the giant crocodile god, much as Hans would later fight the monstrous snake god in \\"The Ivory Child\\" (1916). (These giant animal gods, it should be noted, are likely inspirations for all those similar monstrosities in the tales of Robert E. Howard, just as Hendrika was a likely inspiration for Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan.) But there is no way in the world that a reader--even one familiar with the author--will guess how things turn out for our intrepid explorers, in this continuously engrossing tale. That said, it should be noted that Haggard is guilty of a few slips in the course of the book. A huge gem of the crocodile god is carved from a sapphire; several hundred pages later, it has become a ruby. The motto of Leonard's family is said to be \\"For Heart, Home and Honour\\"; later on, that motto is said to be \\"For Home, Honour and Heart.\\" But these are minor matters that only the sharpest-eyed readers will notice (my personal curse, I suppose). The overwhelming majority of readers, I feel, will be so busy being thrilled and entertained that they will never notice these little goofs. The bottom line is that \\"The People of the Mist\\" is still another wonderful page-turner from H. Rider Haggard. Now, when is some respectful filmmaker going to spend $200 million to bring THIS ONE to the big screen?oman in \\"Allan's Wife\\" (1889).

US	49963565	R3NCCE6KMGC5WX	1592241697	900604297	Smith and the Pharaohs and Other Tales	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A FINE COLLECTION OF HAGGARD'S SHORTER WORKS	Although H. Rider Haggard wrote a total of 58 books of fiction during his four decades as a writer, only two of those titles consist of short stories: \\"Allan's Wife\\" (1889), which includes that novella and three short tales, and \\"Smith and the Pharaohs\\" (1920). This latter volume consists of six brief stories, and is thus a practically unique demonstration of this master storyteller's way with the shorter form. Four of these stories take place in Africa, the setting of so many of Haggard's novels, and all are eminently readable and of interest. The collection kicks off with the title tale, and concerns a budding Egyptologist who is locked up one night in the Cairo Museum, and dreams that he is put on trial for grave robbing by the ghosts of Egypt's pharaohs and queens. Or is it a dream? This is a very amusing, somewhat lighthearted, at times eerie tale, which also serves as a bit of a history lesson for those not up on their ancient lore. While perhaps not on a par with Algernon Blackwood's story \\"A Descent Into Egypt,\\" it remains most entertaining. (Haggard does make a rare goof in this tale, when he writes that Thotmes III was Hatshepu's brother and husband; in actuality, he was her son. Thotmes II was her husband. I know, I know...who cares, right?) Next up is a tale for all fans of Haggard's arguably greatest creation, the hunter Allan Quatermain. Haggard wrote 14 novels dealing with Quatermain, plus those aforementioned three short tales. This volume's \\"Magepa the Buck\\" was the only bit of Quatermain that I'd not previously read, so it was of great interest to me indeed. Here, Allan tells us the story of the greatest instance of bravery that he ever came across during his long career; the tale of Magepa, a Zulu man, and the great sacrifice that he makes for his grandson. It's an exciting little story, well told and moving. \\"The Blue Curtains\\" tells the tale of a British army captain who is stationed in South Africa, and the love affair that he has with an undeserving woman back home in London. This tale builds to a surprisingly tragic conclusion. Next up is my favorite story of the bunch, \\"Little Flower,\\" in which an English missionary and his family live with a Zulu tribe in the hopes of spreading the Good Word. But our small-minded missionary meets his match in the local witch doctor, Menzi, a wonder-worker whose magics are apparently real. This battle of wills is very well paced by the author, and features some exciting set pieces (those magic demonstrations, that stormy finale). A neat touch in this story is the reference to Zikali, the Zulu witch doctor who figured so prominently in many of the Quatermain books. In \\"Only a Dream,\\" Haggard seems to pay tribute to Edgar Allan Poe himself; at least, this short-short is the closest thing to a Poe-like tale of terror that I believe the author ever attempted. Here we meet a man who is seemingly haunted by the spirit of his deceased wife on the eve of his wedding to wife #2. This tale gets a bit gruesome but, short as it is, never really attains to any prolonged shudders. It's fun while it lasts, though. The collection winds up with \\"Barbara Who Came Back,\\" a love tale of sorts in which Haggard gets to revisit some of his favorite themes: eternal love (i.e., love that survives beyond the grave) and reincarnation. We also get to see, in this story, what the author's conception of the afterlife is, and truth to tell, it really doesn't sound half bad! This is also a tale of a mother making a beyond-ultimate sacrifice for her child, and the conclusion of the story will certainly provide some food for thought; a nice ending to a fine collection of Haggard's shorter works. I've never read a novel by this man that I haven't enjoyed, and now I can say the same for his shorter pieces, as well. This is a book well worth your time and attention. And thanks to the folks at Wildside Press--who have brought this and some three dozen other Haggard titles back into publication in no-frillsbut somewhat overpriced editions--you don't have to spend major bucks to enjoy this comparatively obscure collection.	2005-06-07
US	49963565	R1YIWBU9ELHR0L	0345346041	136337176	Nine Tomorrows	Books	4	16	17	N	N	A FINE COLLECTION FROM ONE OF SCI-FI'S MASTERS	Isaac Asimov may very well be the most prolific author in modern history. With over 500 books to his credit (506, to be exact...go to asimovonline.com for the full list, if you don't believe me!), covering just about every subject in the Dewey Decimal System (except philosophy, I believe), the man was a real marvel. One of these 500 volumes, \\"Nine Tomorrows,\\" is a collection of short stories that Doc Ike first had published in various magazines during the period July '56 to November '58. As the title suggests, all nine tales deal with possible futures that may face mankind, and all feature the wit, erudition and clarity that are the hallmarks of every Asimov story/novel that I've ever read. The collection kicks off with the longest tale, \\"Profession,\\" in which Asimov presents a 65th century when one's vocation is determined by a kind of computerized psychological profile, and in which youngsters compete in Olympics-style games for plum jobs on other planets. But what happens if it is deemed that you're cut out for nothing at all? That's what happens to young George Platen, in this consistently interesting tale. (Asimov does make one rare goof in this story: George should be 20, not 19, by the story's end. Has anyone else noticed this?) In \\"The Feeling of Power,\\" Asimov tells us of a scientist who is actually capable of doing simple math problems on paper (gasp!), without the aid of a computer (!), and how the military minds of that distant century make use of these newfound skills. But the old ways of doing things lead to nothing but trouble, in this brilliantly cynical tale. Asimov has been called \\"the Agatha Christie of Science Fiction,\\" and in \\"The Dying Night,\\" a murder mystery of sorts, we see an early example of how he earned that title. A scientist lies dead, his papers on mass transference stolen, and three of his old school chums are suspect. This somewhat contrived story nonetheless leads to a satisfactory conclusion that most readers will never foresee. (The 1965 observations of Mercury, by the way, have dated the science in the tale, but this is certainly nothing that Asimov could have foreseen in July '56.) What is certainly the most humorous tale in the bunch comes next: \\"I'm in Marsport Without Hilda.\\" Written in Heinlein-like, tough-guy prose, this tale concerns a Galactic Service agent who must determine which of three men is attempting to smuggle a powerful drug out of the eponymous port. This one really had me chuckling out loud, and winds up very amusingly indeed. A most entertaining tale. In \\"The Gentle Vultures,\\" the author tells us that an alien race has been living on the Moon's far side for several decades, waiting for Earth's Cold War to blow up so that they might come to our aid...for a fee, of course. Asimov would have us believe that these folks are the source of the 1940s' and '50s' UFO's, and who knows...maybe he's right! Anyway, the interaction between the chimplike aliens and their kidnapped Earthling is very well done in this unique tale. In \\"All the Troubles of the World,\\" a computer is responsible for not only caring for everyone on Earth, but also for predicting and preventing crimes. Is it possible that this 1958 story was inspired in part by P.K. Dick's \\"Minority Report,\\" published two years before? Who knows? The story is very clever, though, and has a most touching ending. \\"Spell My Name With an S\\" shows how the smallest alteration in one's life can occasionally lead to great worldwide changes. A way-out surprise ending caps off another very clever Asimov short story. And then there's \\"The Last Question,\\" in which Asimov theorizes on nothing less than the end of the universe 10 trillion years in the future...and what might happen after that. This is a truly mind-expanding short story that offers much food for thought in its 12 pages. The collection wraps up with perhaps my favorite story of the bunch, \\"The Ugly Little Boy.\\" Here, a nurse is hired to take care of a 4-year-old Neanderthaltyke who has been plucked from the past by a scientific institute. The tale should be instructive to all those critics who have accused Asimov of being unable to depict convincing female characters. Nurse Fellowes is VERY well drawn, I think, with some psychological complexity and surprising maternal tendencies. The ending of this tale is nicely sentimental, and lingers long in the memory. Thus ends a really fine collection of stories from one of sci-fi's true masters. Trust me, you'll wish there were 20 tomorrows here, instead of just nine!	2005-01-08
US	49963565	R1JM158975HRDH	0553274325	602609686	Johnny Got His Gun	Books	5	6	8	N	N	MANDATORY READING	I decided to pick this book up after reading of it in Newman and Jones' excellent overview volume, \\"Horror: 100 Best Books.\\" While the overwhelming majority of the books discussed therein deal with ghosts, the supernatural, werewolves, vampires and the like, Dalton Trumbo's \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" (1939) deals with horror of a different sort: the horror of war, or, more specifically, war's aftermath. In this unforgettable novel, we meet a young man named Joe Bonham, a normal guy from Colorado who has been severely injured toward the end of World War I. And I do mean severely. Joe is now a literal basket case. Both of his legs and arms have been amputated and his face has been blown off. He cannot see, hear, taste or talk, and he lies in a hospital bed in an unknown country. His plight makes Helen Keller's seem enviable; indeed, his condition might well be the worst of any character's in any book ever written! Pretty gruesome horror fare, indeed. As Joe lies in his own world, he flashes back to happier days, and we learn of his family experiences, his love conquests and disappointments, his jobs and his friends. We sense that Joe is a sweet, likeable, um, average Joe, which makes us feel for him all the more. We also see, through his stream of consciousness, some hellish glimpses of the battlefield, but for the most part, those fighting scenes are kept to a minimum. Trumbo is more concerned with what war does to men, and unlike Erich Maria Remarque's \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" the scenes in the trenches are downplayed. In one intense section, Joe realizes that, deaf and blind as he is, he can no longer tell the difference between his waking moments and his horror-filled dreams, and Trumbo really makes us feel his plight. And toward the end of the book, Joe, after many attempts to communicate with his nurses, does succeed in breaking through, and delivers one of the most scathing indictments against warmongers that one could ever hope to read. Trumbo writes in a hot fury, fully aware that the world was gearing up for another global duke-out as he penned his words. And the result is perhaps the best antiwar novel ever written. H.G. Wells, in his 1908 masterpiece \\"The War in the Air,\\" treated us to some brilliant passages in which he decried the savage waste that is war, but Trumbo's book is far more passionate, more savage, and the excoriating, blasting denunciations much more prolonged. There IS one thing that Trumbo's book lacks, however, in all its 243 pages, and that is...commas. Imagine that: a 243-page book without a single comma to be found! Such is the breakneck pace with which Trumbo writes; such is Joe's uninterrupted stream of thought. The book is simply written--a junior high school student would have no trouble zipping through it--and yet devastating at the same time. Joe's communication breakthrough, after many years of trying, may very well have your eyes misting up with tears; if not, what happens as a result surely will. This is a book that should prove pretty hard to forget, and that is a good thing. Its message is one that we would all do well to incorporate. Truly, this book should be mandatory reading for all politicians, heads of state, dictators and other public officials, the whole world over...not to mention all thinking adults. It's just that important.	2004-12-15

At the bottom of the cover, next to the footnote asterisk, is another name: George Hopley. This should not fool any prospective readers, though. Both names were pseudonyms of Cornell Woolrich, the author whom Isaac Asimov called \\"THE Master of Suspense\\"; whom his biographer,  Francis Nevins, Jr., called \\"the Edgar Allan Poe of the 20th century\\" (hey, wait a minute...I thought that H.P. Lovecraft was considered the Edgar Allan Poe of the 20th century!); and who is considered one of the fathers of literary film noir.  Many of Woolrich's novels and stories have been famously filmed, \\"Rear Window,\\" \\"The Bride Wore Black,\\" \\"Phantom Lady,\\" \\"Deadline at Dawn\\" and \\"Mississippi Mermaid\\" being just a sampling.  \\"Night Has a Thousand Eyes\\" (1945) was turned into a 1948 Edward G. Robinson movie that supposedly has little in common with the book. That's a shame, as the book is a marvelous piece of eerie suspense writing that could have made a smashing film. In Woolrich's tale, Detective Tom Shawn saves Jean Reid from a suicide attempt one night, and later hears her tale. She is in despair because the death of her wealthy father has been predicted by a man seemingly gifted with the power of clairvoyance; a man whose predictions have unerringly aided her father in his business many times before. Shawn and a squad of detectives investigate this death prediction, and try to avert the millionaire businessman from meeting his ordained end at the stroke of midnight \\"at the jaws of a lion.\\" The reader will never guess how things turn out, or how Harlan Reid eventually winds up. Woolrich writes with a superabundance of detail, which slows things down a little but also ratchets up the suspense factor. We get more and more nervous as that midnight hour approaches, while Woolrich teases us by describing how the milk looks in one of the character's coffee, and by giving us the minutiae of a bridge game. Hitchcock himself could not have drawn more suspense out of the book's brilliantly sustained final third. It is a bravura example of a writer anticipating what his reader wants, and holding it tantalizingly out of reach... <br />    I came to this book after having read of it in Newman & Jones' overview volume entitled \\"Horror: 100 Best Books.\\" As \\"Night Has...\\" progressed, I found myself thinking that the book isn't all that scary; extremely suspenseful, yes, and in parts a bit eerie, but certainly not a horror book. But upon finishing the novel, the reader will inevitably realize that the characters in \\"Night Has a Thousand Eyes\\" have no free will at all. Everything is preordained, and human beings are trapped in this master plan. The thousand star-eyes of the title look down on us, mercilessly and aloof. No wonder poor Jean Reid can't bear to look at them. Woolrich's vision of a relentless, bleak and deterministic universe turns out to be a pretty horrifying thing after all!	2004-11-16
US	49963565	R2CVOGQVXVW50I	159107049X	713316436	The Maracot Deep	Books	4	4	4	N	N	DOYLE SHINES IN HIS LAST NOVEL	Readers who know of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle through his Sherlock Holmes stories, his tales of Sir Nigel in the 14th century, the Napoleonic adventures of Brigadier Gerard or the sci-fi escapades of Professor Challenger may still be unfamiliar with \\"The Maracot Deep.\\" Published in 1929, only a year before the author's death, this short novel amply demonstrates that Doyle still retained all his great abilities as a spinner of riveting yarns, even in his twilight years. At a mere 140 pages, the novel(la) is a compact but densely written fantasy of the discovery of the remnants of Atlantis. It seems that Professor Maracot (a kind of early 20th century cross between Jacques Cousteau and Robert Ballard), along with an American naturalist and an American engineer, had suffered a terrible accident while in his bathysphere off the Canary Islands. A giant crayfish had separated the hawser connecting them to their mother ship, and down they went, 26,000 feet, into the abyss of the eponymous Maracot Deep. Miraculously, disaster is averted as Maracot & Co. are rescued by the survivors of the lost Atlantean civilization, which society has been living under the ocean floor for the last 8,000 years. Our heroes are given a tour of the Atlantean realm and witness many monstrous varieties of undersea life, including a giant electric sea-worm, poisonous purple slugs, and the sea serpent of legend. They witness some of the Atlantean relics of superscience, explore the ruins of the capital city, and have a run-in with the \\"Lord of the Dark Face.\\" <br />    This is a wonderful fantasy, and keeps the reader thoroughly entertained throughout. It is largely epistolary in nature, taking the form of various letters/\\"messages in a bottle\\" that our heroes manage to get back to the world. Doyle solves the problem of there being no light at the ocean bottom by having Maracot & Co. discover that the ocean floor's globigerina ooze is phosphorescent, due to the decomposing marine life. As for the unbearable pressure, our boys discover some mysterious compensating factor that nullifies that problem. So they are able to walk around with their vitrine helmets and oxygen tanks and explore the ocean depths very comfortably, thank you. Doyle, an ardent spiritualist in his twilight years, had his Professor Challenger character (his favorite) convert from being a hardened materialist to a believer in the unseen forces that surround us, in his 1926 novel \\"The Land of Mist.\\" And in his last novel, he does likewise for Professor Maracot, whose \\"theories of a lifetime have crumbled about [his] ears\\" after his battle with the mystical Lord of the Dark Face. This really is a remarkable story. If only Doyle hadn't made one tremendous booboo. At one point in the tale, Headley, our narrator, falls in love with an Atlantean named Mona, the daughter of Scarpa, a community leader. Fifty pages later, she is the daughter of Manda, the chief of Atlantis! This is a terrible oversight on Doyle's part, and on the part of his editors, and undermines what up until then had been a meticulously put-together tale. This major slip aside, \\"The Maracot Deep\\" is guaranteed to give all sci-fi/fantasy fans a few nights of great pleasure indeed. It would make for excellent reading after one finishes C.J. Cutcliffe Hyne's classic novel of ancient Atlantis, \\"The Lost Continent\\" (1900), which details Atlantis as it was back when. Doyle tells us what's going on there now.	2004-09-30
US	49963565	R339843VE1STSA	1419149288	155032120	Stella Fregelius	Books	5	10	10	N	N	ONE OF HAGGARD'S MOST BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN BOOKS	At the beginning of his 25th novel, \\"Stella Fregelius\\" (1903), H. Rider Haggard deemed it necessary to offer an apology to his public. In this brief foreword, the author warns prospective readers that \\"Stella\\" is not one of his typical tales, and one with \\"few exciting incidents.\\" Indeed, those expecting the typical Haggardian mix of lost races, African adventure, big-game hunting, massive battle scenes and historical sweep may be disappointed with this book. However, I feel that Rider Haggard need not have bothered with an apology, as \\"Stella Fregelius\\" turns out to be one of his most beautifully written, deeply felt and truly romantic works. <br />    The story here concerns one Morris Monk, a British inventor who is trying, when we first meet him, to perfect a device that he calls an \\"aerophone\\" (it seems, from the description, to be a bulkier version of today's ubiquitous cell phone). As his name implies, Monk is a scholarly man with little to no interest in women. Soon, however, he is coerced into marrying his wealthy first cousin (don't ask), Mary, as a means of saving his family's debt-ridden estate. Trouble is not long in coming, when Morris saves the life of the eponymous Stella from a shipwreck in the North Sea. As in Haggard's earlier novel \\"Mr. Meeson's Will\\" (1888) and the later \\"Benita\\" (1906), a shipwreck does play a pivotal role in this story. This shipwreck scene and its aftermath, by the way, constitute the only true action set pieces in the novel. It doesn't take too long for the reader to realize that Morris and Stella are \\"soul mates,\\" which situation leads to all sorts of Edwardian mishegas, including [WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD!!!] Stella's death. And it is here that the novel reveals its true purpose, that of showing us that there are loves that survive beyond the grave, and that a spiritual connection is so much more important than the physical and temporal. Toss out your Harlequin paperbacks, ladies; this story is a TRUE romance! The theme of \\"eternal love\\" was one that Haggard returned to repeatedly, from his very first novel \\"Dawn\\" (1884), through all four She novels, and elsewhere. He himself was involved with a \\"soul mate\\" who he just happened to NOT be married to, and thus one can understand why \\"Stella\\" meant so much to him. This novel is somewhat reminiscent of his \\"Jess\\" (1887) and also his \\"Beatrice\\" (1890), in that it deals with a married man who finds his perfect match...elsewhere. All three tales end tragically, but in \\"Stella Fregelius,\\" at least Haggard holds out the hope of a happy ending in the form of a blissful afterlife. The scenes in which the bereaved Morris attempts to communicate with his lost Stella are truly touching, and are written in some of Haggard's most beautiful, lyrical prose. This is also one of the most symbolic and metaphor packed of all Haggard's novels(at least, of the two dozen that I've been fortunate enough to have read), and contains many passages that the reader may want to peruse over and over, or at least underline for future reference. Filled with warm and touching characters; featuring a few genuinely exciting scenes; and crammed with Haggard's thoughts on life, love, religion and the afterlife, \\"Stella Fregelius\\" is a wonderful read. And certainly nothing to apologize for! I hope that Haggard felt, when he reread this finished work, something akin to the sentiment that Stella describes in one scene: \\"I have done something; it is good; it cannot be changed; it is a stone built forever in the pyramid of beauty, or knowledge, or advancement.\\"	2004-09-10

In her role of feisty, put-upon suburban housewife Debra Barone, she brings depth and dimension to her character with great grace, cutting humor and a wide emotional range. She is, for me, the single best thing about this terrific show. Indeed, her work in one standout episode (I believe the title is \\"Bad Moon Rising\\"), in which Debra deals with a nasty case of PMS, is some of the very best I've ever seen a sitcom actress give us...and I'm not forgetting the likes of Lucille Ball, Loretta Swit and Shelley Long when I make that statement. I hope that it was for this episode that Ms. Heaton won one of her back-to-back Emmys, in 2000 and 2001. Ms. Heaton is also, inexplicably, one of the small screen's least ballyhooed beauties, with one of the nicest smiles on TV. For these and other reasons, I was very interested to read what she had to say in her 2002 autobiography, \\"Motherhood and Hollywood: How to Get a Job Like Mine.\\" Well, the not-so-new news is that not only does the book let us learn where Patty Heaton came from, and how she got to the high place she is at today, but that it does so with much self-deprecating humor as well. Ms. Heaton writes as if she were telling us her story and views of life over a few drinks in the backyard of her Los Angeles home. The book is chatty without being gossipy; indeed, many readers may be disappointed that more \\"dirt\\" is not dished regarding the \\"Raymond\\" show's cast and crew. <br />    Rather, the book is organized into three sections. In the first, we learn of Heaton's youth, growing up in a staunch Catholic family in a Cleveland suburb that sounds like Hooterville or Mayberry, from the author's descriptions. In part two, Patty comes to the Big Apple, and we learn of the many so-called \\"survival jobs\\"--eight years' worth of them--that Ms. Heaton endured. Finally, in part three, Heaton lands in L.A., and eventually, after her second marriage, some minor film parts and assorted TV work, nabs the role on \\"Raymond\\" for which she is best known. During the course of the book, Heaton gives us her views on modern-day education, child rearing, religion, acting awards, and stay-at-home moms. So yes, we DO get to know Ms. Heaton to a certain degree. Such topics as her first marriage and her brief drug dalliances are given the barest of mentions, and not mentioned at all are her other relationships, her production company, and her pro-life stance, which latter has set her apart in the Hollywood community. She doesn't even mention how she landed the plum role of Debra Barone! Still, it IS Patty's book, and I suppose it's her right to choose to include or exclude whatever she likes. This is hardly an in-depth autobiography (at 207 pages, how could it hope to be?); more like cherry-picked snapshots of what makes Ms. Heaton tick. To her credit, the book was written with no assistance from a ghost writer, and so Ms. Heaton should feel proud to have written a fun, lighthearted but telling book all by herself. Many of the lines in it are laff-out-loud funny. I never thought that I, a nonpracticing Jewish man who is ardently pro-choice, would ever have much to say to the proudly religious and openly pro-life Patricia Heaton if I were ever fortunate enough to meet her, but she comes across as such a fun and decent person in this book that I now think there'd be no problem. And really, how can any woman who's into \\"Jonny Quest\\" and John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\" NOT be a fun person? <br />    That said, I must add that a close reading of the book reveals some minor problems. Ms. Heaton refers to Moses Cleveland, the founder of her hometown; that should be Moses Cleaveland. The word \\"shearing\\" is used instead of \\"shirring,\\" and \\"phased\\" instead of \\"fazed.\\" Officer \\"Tootie\\" of the classic \\"Car 54...\\" TV show is referenced; that should be \\"Toody.\\" And for some reason, Patricia insists on peppering her book withdozens and dozens of urinary, fecal, menstrual and throw-up references. Was Patty trying to be funny with these, or to show that she could be as coarse as the best of them, or what? In any case, these minor quibbles hardly detract from what should be essential reading for all fans of this wonderful actress. So do we really learn how to get a job like hers, as the title promises? Well, I suppose that if we read between the lines, the answer is to be born with God-given good looks and considerable talent, to keep trying and struggling, and maybe, just maybe, you'll catch a break. Fortunately for all of us, Ms. Heaton got the breaks that she so well deserved. And now, perhaps we can coerce another book out of her...	2004-08-17
US	49963565	R37C4ZDVHAZ6JP	038055822X	402540952	The Black Wheel	Books	3	5	5	N	N	A MUST FOR ALL MERRITT COMPLETISTS	When Abraham Merritt died of a heart attack on August 21, 1943, at the age of 59, the world lost one of the greatest writers of adventure fantasy of all time. He left behind a number of novels in various stages of completion, including the first quarter of &quot;The Black Wheel.&quot; Hannes Bok, an artist and illustrator who did almost 150 covers for assorted pulp magazines, starting with the December 1939 issue of &quot;Weird Tales,&quot; took on the formidable task of completing Merritt's story. Bok was the first artist, by the way, to win a Hugo award, and went on to pen several other novels of his own. I must say that he does a rather good job at pastiching Merritt's style; were it not for the copyright lines at the front of the book, one would never know that Merritt's writing concludes at the end of Chapter 7, and that Bok then added Chapters 8-27.  He admirably copies the densely written, hyperadjectival purple prose of Merritt's early period. Unfortunately, what he fails to do is get Merritt's feel for pace and suspense. Much of this novel is overwritten, wordy and slow moving. The story is a fascinating one, but somehow Bok, despite all his $2 words and flair for language, doesn't give the tale a sense of immediacy and creeping dread. Still, the reader's interest IS engaged, for the most part, and the book's final 50 pages or so are quite thrilling.<BR>    The story concerns a young doctor, Ross Fenimore, who tells us of his adventures after he signs on for a trip on the Susan Ann. This sailing ship is owned by a millionaire lawyer who has gathered an oddball assortment of friends and crew for a Caribbean pleasure trip. A hurricane maroons the lot on a deserted isle, where the wreck of a 200-year-old ship is discovered. The ship contains the mummified remains of a white man and half a dozen Africans, and before long, their spirits are (seemingly) inhabiting the various members of the Susan Ann. I say &quot;seemingly&quot; only because, despite the reader'scertainty that the strange occurrences have a supernatural origin, Fenimore insists on rationalizing everything away materialistically. These unwanted explanations eventually become tiresome (for this reader, anyway); like Dr. Lowell in Merritt's &quot;Burn, Witch, Burn&quot; and Alan Caranac in &quot;Creep, Shadow, Creep,&quot; Fenimore refuses to accept anything that hints of the otherworldly, even when the evidence is overwhelming. The entire middle section of the book is taken up with the various characters telling of their dreams and visions, and Fenimore explaining them away. There are some other problems that the reader will face, also. The eye color of one of the characters keeps changing from violet to blue and then back to violet. A Scottish woman on board speaks the pure Scot to the extent that a reader will need a good, UNabridged dictionary to follow her. Worse still is the inclusion of a Stepin Fetchit-like character, with all the embarrassing black stereotypes that one can imagine. I might also add that the McTeague character in the book, an Irishman with the gift of second sight, is a wee bit too much like the fey Irishman Larry O'Keefe in Merritt's first novel, &quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; but that may be carping. Fortunately for &quot;The Black Wheel,&quot; things really DO pick up during those final 50 pages, which include another monster storm, a lost race of albino cannibals, and the deaths of most of the book's characters (that last is NOT a spoiler; it's mentioned on page 1!). But I still feel that this book, the longest of any Merritt novel, could have been edited down by at least 50 pages. There is one seemingly endless section, for example, in which Bok needlessly gives us what seems to be every bit of historical and cultural lore regarding the mystical uses of wheels and circles, from the Egyptians to the Druids to the Buddhists, all of which, despite its interest, will probably make most readers want to scream &quot;get on with it!&quot; Still, &quot;The Black Wheel&quot; IS an interesting read, and certainly a must for all Merritt completists.	2004-07-14
US	49963565	RIPUQW9LN0TLE	0380017091	691647623	Fox Woman and Other Stories	Books	4	9	9	N	N	ABRAHAM MERRITT'S ONLY COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES...	&quot;The Fox Woman and Other Stories&quot; is the only collection of Abraham Merritt's shorter works, and contains seven stories and two &quot;fragments.&quot; These short stories span the entire career of the man who has been called America's foremost adventure fantasist of the 1920s and '30s. Several of the tales boast the lush purple prose of Merritt's early period (as seen especially in his first two novels, &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; and &quot;The Metal Monster&quot;), but all seven are finely written little gems. They run the gamut from full-blown fantasy to lost-world adventure to outright science fiction, and abundantly demonstrate that Merritt was a master of the concise short form, as well as the full-length novel.<BR>    The collection kicks off with one of its strongest tales, &quot;The Fox Woman,&quot; a tale of revenge in a remote part of 20th century China. Here, a young American woman is attacked by a band of assassins and is aided by the shape-shifting entity of the title. This is one of Merritt's most poetic works, and one of his most unpredictable. &quot;The People of the Pit&quot; follows, and is a lost-world tale that takes place in the wilds of the Yukon. A dying explorer tells the story of a civilization that he found far underground; one that contains a kind of semi-invisible snail/light populace. This is a tale that lovers of H.P. Lovecraft will enjoy, what with its bizarre creatures, brooding temple god and atmosphere of creeping menace. This is one memorable story, indeed. &quot;Through the Dragon Glass&quot; is a fantasy that tells of a man who enters a kind of alternate world by passing through an ancient Chinese relic. Just as Lewis Carroll's Alice had done, Jim Herndon in this tale has some truly bizarre adventures. In &quot;The Drone,&quot; a group of men (including Alan Caranac, hero of Merritt's &quot;Creep, Shadow, Creep&quot;!) sit around and throw tales back and forth; tales concerning men who had the ability to change themselvesinto animals. We hear of a man/hyena in Ethiopia and a man/bee in the wilds of...New Jersey, and some theories for these happenings are propounded in very interesting fashion. &quot;The Last Poet and the Robots&quot; is, as far as I know, Merritt's only piece of futuristic sci-fi, taking place as it does in the 30th century. Here, a band of scientists who have decided to live underground, away from the society they care little about, come to Man's aid when those pesky robots revolt. This tale features the outrageous superscience and way-out gizmos that typified much of the sci-fi of the 1930s. &quot;Three Lines of Old French&quot; is the next offering, and is one of the loveliest tales in the book. Merritt himself appears as one of the characters in the tale's intro, but the story really concerns a young American soldier who seems to meet a French girl of 200 years ago, whilst he is on guard in his World War I trench. Or perhaps I shouldn't say &quot;seems to&quot;? This is one charming fantasy indeed. Up next are two short fragments that were meant to be the openings of novels that Merritt never completed. &quot;The White Road&quot; tells of a young man who has had visions of that road since childhood. It's hard to tell just where Merritt intended to go with this tale, on the basis of the six pages that remain. &quot;When Old Gods Wake&quot; was meant to be a sequel to Merritt's novel &quot;The Face in the Abyss,&quot; set in Mexico, apparently, rather than the earlier book's Peru. The fragment entices with its exotic setting, squabbling lovers, and hints of elder gods coming back to life. And the collection ends with &quot;The Women of the Wood,&quot; a beautiful tale of a man who gets caught in a clash between some woodsmen and the dryads that they are endangering. This is the type of story that fans of Algernon Blackwood will appreciate...not to mention all &quot;tree huggers.&quot; Blackwood always excelled at this kind of &quot;Nature personified&quot; tale,and Merritt here demonstrates that he was no slouch at the game himself. Anyway, this collection is a must for all Merritt fans, and for fantasy fans in general. Abraham Merritt surely did have a style all his own, and after reading &quot;The Fox Woman and Other Stories,&quot; one will feel compelled to admit that that style translated extremely well to the shorter form. Seek this one out, by all means!	2004-06-19
US	49963565	RWC9CL4FS06F2	0843939443	630784266	Burn, Witch, Burn! / Creep, Shadow, Creep!	Books	5	13	13	N	N	ONE THRILLING LITTLE SERIES	Having conquered the field of fantasy (with such classics as &quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; &quot;The Ship of Ishtar&quot; and &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot;) as well as the field of the bizarre yet hardboiled crime thriller (with his wonderful &quot;Seven Footprints to Satan&quot;), Abraham Merritt went on, in 1932, to prove that he could master the field of supernatural horror, as well. That he succeeded brilliantly should come as no surprise to readers of those earlier works. His first foray in the occult, &quot;Burn, Witch, Burn&quot; first appeared in the pages of &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine in 1932, and was then expanded into book form the following year. In it, we meet Dr. Lowell, an eminent neurologist who becomes curious when a series of mysterious deaths comes to his attention. Men and women in the NYC area have been dying of no apparent cause, but with horrible grimaces on their faces and with very rapid onsets of rigor mortis. Lowell is aided in his investigation by Ricori, a mobster chieftain, as well as by Ricori's very efficient gang. The trail of bizarre deaths leads to one Madame Mandilip and her doll shop, and before long the reader is immersed in a world of supernaturalism and escalating tension. Lowell, hardheaded man of the 20th century, is hard put to explain the unfolding creepy events by the lights of his mundane science. Merritt writes simply in this book; one would never recognize him as the author of &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; and &quot;The Metal Monster,&quot; with those books' lush, purple-prose passages. All of our questions regarding the strange events in &quot;Burn, Witch, Burn&quot; are not answered by the tale's end, and this only seems to make what has transpired seem all the more mysterious. This is the type of book that a reader may feel compelled to gulp down in one sitting, and with its short, 160-page length, that could easily be accomplished. This tale was loosely adapted for the screen as &quot;The Devil-Doll&quot; (1935), but this film has little to do with its source novel. (Incidentally, the movie &quot;Burn, Witch, Burn&quot; (1962), also known as &quot;Night of the Eagle,&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with Merritt's book, but is rather based on Fritz Leiber's novel &quot;Conjure Wife,&quot; another tale of modern-day witchcraft that I highly recommend to amazon readers.)<BR>    Good as Merritt's &quot;Burn, Witch, Burn&quot; is, however, its successor, &quot;Creep, Shadow, Creep,&quot; is even better. &quot;Creep, Shadow, Creep&quot; also saw the first light of day in the pages of &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine, in 1934, and was released in book form later that year. This novel is a direct sequel to &quot;Burn, Witch, Burn,&quot; and is longer, more detailed, more stylishly written and scarier than the earlier work. Readers will delight to find Lowell and Ricori back to fight the supernatural once again, but this time, these characters play only subsidiary roles. The action mantle in &quot;Creep, Shadow, Creep&quot; falls mainly on a young ethnologist named Alan Caranac, who becomes involved in the investigation of the apparent suicides of a number of wealthy NYC men, one of whom was Caranac's old friend. He is soon drawn into the schemes of one Dr. Keradel and his daughter Dahut, who are attempting to conjure into existence one of the elder gods; a god that was worshipped in the legendary city of Ys. In &quot;Creep, Shadow, Creep,&quot; Merritt's last completed novel, the author revisits several of his old favorite themes. As in &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; and &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage,&quot; we have two women--one good and virginal, the other evil and lustful--fighting over the book's protagonist. As in &quot;Dwellers,&quot; the hero is subject to atavistic memories that tend to submerge his present-day personality, while at the same time aiding him in conjuring up a monstrous entity from beyond. And as in &quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; &quot;The Metal Monster,&quot;  &quot;The Face in the Abyss,&quot; &quot;The Ship of Ishtar&quot; and &quot;Dwellers,&quot; in this novel we are given a glimpse of a vanished, lost civilization (in this case, Ys, in ancient Brittany) and see that, in many real ways, it survives in the present day. &quot;Creep, Shadow, Creep&quot; is not for the squeamish reader, containing as it does some truly horrible passages of pagan sacrifice and torture. It also contains some surprisingly risque sections, in which Dahut and Caranac's girlfriend, Helen, appear mother-naked. Risque for 2004, how these passages must have impressed 70 years ago! Despite the truly frightening goings-on in this book--the shadow people, the Gatherer in the Cairn, the atavistic memories, the visions and so on--Merritt insists on offering rational/mundane explanations for all this...but the reader, as well as Caranac by the tale's end, knows better. &quot;Creep, Shadow, Creep&quot; is a wonderful tale, a perfect sequel, and one of Merritt's finest accomplishments. Despite Merritt's occasional inability to adequately describe geography so that it is clear to the reader (this reader, at least), and despite one or two minor glitches (such as when he describes Dahut's eyes as being green, after having long established that they are violet), the book succeeds on many levels. Taken together, the two books make for one thrilling little series. I heartily recommend them both to all amazon readers.	2004-06-11

MERRITT	After taking a brief respite--in the hardboiled yet outre crime thriller &quot;Seven Footprints to Satan&quot;--from the tales of adventurous fantasy at which he so excelled, Abraham Merritt returned in fine form with &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot; (1932). In this terrific novel, Merritt revisits many of the themes and uses many of the ingredients that made his first novel, &quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; such an impressive success. Like that early work, &quot;Dwellers&quot; features a lost civilization (of the type grandfathered by the great H. Rider Haggard), battling priestesses, civil wars, and otherdimensional creatures (in the earlier book, a light creature; in &quot;Dwellers,&quot; an octopuslike nasty named Khalk'ru that dissolves whatever life-form it touches). In this marvelous fantasy, we meet Leif Langdon, who is hiking through the foothills of the Endicott Mountains in northern Alaska with his Native American buddy. Years before, Leif had witnessed an arcane religious ritual in Mongolia, and been told by the Uighur tribesmen there that he was a descendant of Dwayanu, an ancient Mongolian king. Leif and his buddy discover a hidden valley covered by a freak Alaskan mirage, and meet the golden-skinned pygmy peoples and the Mongolian descendants that reside therein. Before long, in an instance of extreme atavism, Dwayanu takes over Leif's mind and personality, and aids him in his upcoming trials. Leif must eventually encounter a civil war between the valley's inhabitants; the storming of the fugitive city of Sirk; the charms of a witch woman with the most appropriate name of Lur; giant leeches; AND the aforementioned Khalk'ru. The book is just brimming with marvelous imagination and endless wonder, and the reader will never guess what outrageous incidents will pop up next. Merritt was truly at the top of his form with &quot;Dwellers,&quot; and threw in great detail to keep the whole conceit afloat. There are amusing side characters, interesting species of flora and fauna, some historical and metaphysical speculations, and bits of unusual anthropology. The tale proceeds with great drive and purpose, and concludes most satisfactorily, indeed. &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot; has been included in Cawthorn &amp; Moorcock's excellent overview volume &quot;Fantasy: The 100 Best Books,&quot; and I can well understand why. It is a tale that Haggard himself may well have enjoyed, and if you knew me, you'd know that this is high praise, indeed! Seek this book out, by all means; it's a winner!	2004-05-21

MERRITT	Readers of Abraham Merritt's first four novels--&quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; &quot;The Metal Monster,&quot; &quot;The Face in the Abyss&quot; and &quot;The Ship of Ishtar&quot;--may feel a little surprised as they get into his fifth, &quot;Seven Footprints to Satan.&quot; Whereas those earlier fantasy masterpieces featured exotic locales such as the Pacific islands, the Himalayas and Peru; extravagant purple prose, dense with hyperadjectival descriptions; and living light creatures, metallic sentient cubes, a lost semireptilian race and battling gods, &quot;Footprints&quot; takes place, for the most part, in good ol' New York City and its suburbs, and tells an almost realistic tale of kidnapping and crime in direct, almost blunt prose. Indeed, although &quot;Footprints&quot; first appeared in &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine in 1927, and in book form the following year, it almost reads as if it had come from the pages of one of the crime pulps, such as &quot;Black Mask&quot; or &quot;Crack Detective Stories.&quot; In this fast-moving tale, we meet James Kirkham, an adventurer/explorer (and, with a name like that, future candidate for Star Fleet Academy!) who is kidnapped off the streets of downtown Manhattan by the minions of Satan, a crime lord/supervillain/evil genius. Kirkham is forced to play a game in Satan's lair, during which he is made to tread on seven glowing footprints, four of which are &quot;fortunate&quot; and three &quot;unfortunate.&quot; Depending on the steps he lands on, he will either be killed, serve Satan for a year, be given a fantastic fortune, etc. I am not giving away too much by saying that Kirkham winds up a bond servant to Satan, and is compelled to commit various fantastic crimes while in his service. He is housed in Satan's mazelike chateau with dozens of others, and falls in love with a fellow prisoner, Eve. (I suppose having Kirkham's first name be &quot;Adam&quot; would have been forcing things a bit!) <BR>    Grotesque in appearance, vastof intellect, profound lover of beauty, and sadistic in the extreme, Satan makes for one terrific character. With his strain of Chinese background, he is reminiscent of Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu, but also of the supervillains of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels. Indeed, for much of the novel, it is unclear whether Satan is or isn't the actual article; Old Scratch himself. The scenes in which he is present are quite riveting. Merritt keeps things barely on this side of reality; nothing that transpires in the book--the museum theft, the slaves kept in bondage by the mind-altering kehft drug, the worldwide criminal organization, the high-seas piracy--is beyond the realm of credibility. And, suiting style to story, Merritt, as I mentioned up top, writes in spare, wonderfully controlled, crime-pulp prose. Thus, we get a line such as &quot;I shot from the floor, and ...drilled [him] through the head.&quot; The dropping of the aforementioned purple prose makes the book seem lean and streamlined; it really does move, and keeps the reader turning the pages. The finale of the book is thrilling in the extreme, and concludes most satisfactorily. I have read that &quot;Footprints&quot; was turned into a 1928 film starring Thelma Todd as Eve, but from the plot synopses on imdb.com, it would seem that this film is a very loose adaptation, at best. I'd love to see it one day, just for comparative purposes, but can't imagine it equalling the suspense and excitement of the book. &quot;Footprints&quot; may have been a change in direction for A. Merritt, but it still makes for marvelous entertainment.	2004-05-02

An altered version appeared in book form in 1926, and the world finally received the original work in book form in 1949, six years after Merritt's death. In this wonderful novel we meet John Kenton, an American archaeologist who has just come into possession of a miniature crystal ship recently excavated &quot;from the sand shrouds of ages-dead Babylon.&quot; Before too long, Kenton is whisked onto the actual ship, of which his relic is just a symbol. It turns out that the ship is sailing the seas of an otherdimensional limboland, and manned by the evil followers of the Babylonian god of the dead, Nergal, and by the priestesses of the Babylonian fertility goddess, Ishtar. A force barrier of sorts prevents the two parties from coming into contact with each other, and they have been sailing thus for...nobody knows how long. It seems that, centuries ago, a priest of Nergal and a priestess of Ishtar had been guilty of the sin of falling in love; this eternal cruise is the punishment that has been meted out by the gods. Kenton becomes embroiled in this ages-old strife; falls in love himself with Sharane, a Babylonian princess; eventually takes over the ship; and then goes in pursuit of the Black Priest of Nergal, after Sharane is kidnapped. He is aided in his quest by a sword-swinging Viking, a hugely strong and mace-wielding man of Nineveh, and by a scimitar expert from Persia. The quartet makes for one formidable team, lemme tell you! This is high fantasy done to a turn, and Merritt is at the peak of his game here. While &quot;Ship&quot; does not boast as much of the purple prose and hyperadjectival descriptions as his first two books, &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; and &quot;The Metal Monster,&quot; there is still quite a bit, and in places the descriptions of various isles and temples almost reads like prose poetry. The story movesalong briskly and builds to a pair of splendid set pieces: Sharane's rescue from the Temple of Seven Zones, in which each floor is dedicated to another Babylonian god and is decked out with its own color scheme, shrines and so on; and a very tense sea battle between the Ship of Ishtar and the Black Priest's bireme. The novel really is a stunning feat of imagination. I wonder if Merritt was perhaps influenced or inspired by the excavations at Uruk (now in southern Iraq, and one of the original cities of Ishtar worship) that had commenced in 1912. He may have also been inspired here by H. Rider Haggard's seminal fantasy work &quot;She&quot; (1887), in which Ayesha, head priestess of Isis, is given an eternal punishment for her own love dalliances. Whatever the inspirations, though, Merritt makes it all work, with great detail, color, action and character.<BR>    The book is a fantasy classic, but still, Merritt makes some small booboos. Thus, the gold bracelet on Kenton's left arm is on his right arm several pages later. Kenton is said to have disappeared from his NYC apartment at 8 PM, while later Merritt tells us that is was 9 PM. Sargon of Akkad (an ancient Mesopotamian ruler) is said to have ruled 6,000 years ago, whereas in actuality, it was more like 4,300. Merritt, in the course of the book, is also guilty of some fuzzy writing. But these little glitches should in no way interfere with anyone's enjoyment of this rousing tale. I should perhaps mention here that &quot;The Ship of Ishtar&quot; has been included in Cawthorn &amp; Moorcock's overview volume &quot;Fantasy: The 100 Best Books,&quot; and that I personally have no problem with that inclusion. It really is a fantasy for the ages.	2004-04-16
US	49963565	R3WGP5GOYM9ZD	0380018748	941760561	Face in the Abyss	Books	3	10	11	N	N	A BOOK OF REAL MERRITT	Abraham Merritt's &quot;The Face in the Abyss&quot; first appeared as a short story in a 1923 issue of &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine. It would be another seven years before its sequel, &quot;The Snake Mother,&quot; appeared in &quot;Argosy,&quot; and yet another year before the book-length version combined these two tales, in 1931. It is easy to detect the book's provenance as two shorter stories, as the first third of the novel is pretty straightforward treasure-hunting fare, while the remainder of the book takes a sharp turn into lost-world fantasy, of the kind popularized by H. Rider Haggard and Edgar Rice Burroughs. In this novel we meet Nick Graydon, an American miner, who is searching for lost Incan loot with three of the nastiest compadres you can imagine. In the Peruvian wastes, they come across a mysterious girl, and are led by her toward Yu-Atlanchi, the so-called Hidden Land. Graydon's cohorts suffer a mysterious fate, but Graydon himself goes on to discover Yu-Atlanchi's many wonders. He meets the Snake Mother, one of Merritt's finest creations: a half snake/half girl entity who is countless aeons old and possessed of ancient wisdom. The Snake Mother is similar in nature to the Silent Ones of Merritt's first novel, &quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; but is a much more fleshed-out character. It seems that Graydon has stumbled into Yu-Atlanchi just as civil war is about to break out there. Nimir, an evil lord whom the Snake Mother had imprisoned ages ago, has returned, and is intent on using his weapons of mind control and superscience to rule the world. Merritt does ultimately treat us to a nifty battle between the forces of Nimir (aided by his lizard men, dinosaurs and various weapons) and the Snake Mother (aided by her invisible flying lizards and assorted way-out armaments). But before we get to that battle, Merritt also dishes out a dinosaur hunt, a dinosaur race, a tour through the Cavern of Lost Wisdom, a garden of evil, mind control, spirit possession, spider-men (and NOT of the Peter Parker variety!), and some fascinating history of and philosophizing by the Snake Mother. It's all wonderfully pulpy and improbable stuff, but Merritt throws quite a bit into the book to keep the reader well entertained.<BR>    On the down side, &quot;The Face in the Abyss&quot; does not feature as much of the wonderful purple prose that made earlier Merritt works such as &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; and &quot;The Metal Monster&quot; so special. This book seems to have been written more quickly and, in some places, almost carelessly. For example, in one scene, the moon is said to be rising from the west! In another, Graydon is said to have only one pistol, under his arm, although the pistol he's had at his waist is never mentioned again. That Cavern of Lost Wisdom seems so easy to come across that it's impossible for the reader to believe that it has been undiscovered for thousands of years. Merritt is also guilty of occasional fuzzy writing in &quot;Face&quot; (such as when he refers to a &quot;three foot parapet&quot;; is that three feet high or three feet wide, or what?), and much of the geography of the incessant tunnel crawling that takes place in the book is hard to follow. But perhaps this is deliberate on Merritt's part. Not all of our questions are concretely answered by the novel's end, and Graydon's theorizing is apparently meant to suffice. But I suppose that this is all nitpicking. What &quot;Face&quot; ultimately does succeed at is in providing action-packed escapism, constant imagination and colorful wonders. What an incredible Hollywood blockbuster this would make! Anyway, as it is, this is yet another fine fantasy from Abraham Merritt.	2004-03-26
US	49963565	R1VPSZ4LQITJR4	0967321514	719096499	The Metal Monster (Lovecraft's Library)	Books	4	10	10	N	N	ANOTHER WINNING FANTASY BY A. MERRITT	Abraham Merritt's second novel, \\"The Metal Monster,\\" first saw the light of day in 1920, in \\"Argosy\\" magazine. It was not until 1946 that this masterful fantasy creation was printed in book form. In a way, this work is a continuation of Merritt's first novel, \\"The Moon Pool\\" (1919), as it is a narrative of America's foremost botanist, Dr. Walter T. Goodwin, narrator of that earlier adventure as well. As Goodwin tells us, he initially set out on this second great adventure to forget the terrible incidents of the first; if anything, however, the events depicted in \\"The Metal Monster\\" are at least as mindblowing as those in the earlier tale. While Goodwin had encountered underground civilizations, frogmen, battling priestesses and a living-light entity in the earlier tale, this time around he discovers, in the Trans-Himalayan wastes of Tibet, a surviving Persian city, a half-human priestess, AND an entire civilization made up of living, metallic, geometric forms; an entire city of sentient cubes, globes and tetrahedrons, capable of joining together and forming colossal shapes, and wielding death rays and other armaments of destruction. As in the earlier tale, Goodwin is joined in his epic adventure by a small group of can-do individuals that he meets in the most unlikely, godforsaken areas of the world. This time around, it's a brother-and-sister team of scientists, as well as the son of one of Goodwin's old science buddies.<BR>    The sense of awe and wonder so crucial to good adventure fantasy is of a very high order in this book. Goodwin & Co., in one of the book's best set pieces, explore the living city of metal, and witness  the life forms feeding off the sun, reproducing, and preparing for war. Later on, Merrittt treats us to a titanic battle between the metal folk and the lost Persians, as well as an hallucinatory cataclysm at the novel's end. Indeed, much of the book IS hallucinatory, with the metal shapes coalescing and morphing like crazy Transformers gone wild. A book by A. Merritt would be nothing without his hyperstylized, lush purple prose, and in this tale, his gift for somewhat prolix prose is given full vent. At times these incessant descriptions wear a bit thin, and at others they paradoxically fail to stir up pictures in the reader's mind eye. (I defy anyone, for example, to say that he/she was able to fully visualize Goodwin & Co.'s initial nighttime entry into the city of the metal people.) For the most part, though, these descriptions are amazing. Just take this one small sample. Whereas other writers might simply say that Goodwin entered a chamber with multicolored lights, here's what Merritt gives us:<BR>    \\"...a limitless temple of light. High up in it, strewn manifold, danced and shone soft orbs like tender suns. No pale gilt luminaries of frozen rays were these. Effulgent, jubilant, they flamed--orbs red as wine of rubies that Djinns of Al Shiraz press from his enchanted vineyards of jewels; twin orbs rose white as breasts of pampered Babylonian maids; orbs of pulsing opalescences and orbs of the murmuring green of bursting buds of spring, crocused orbs and orbs of royal coral; suns that throbbed with singing rays of wedded rose and pearl and of sapphires and topazes amorous; orbs born of  cool virginal dawns and of imperial sunsets and orbs that were the tuliped fruit of mating rainbows of fire....\\"<BR>    Almost like prose poetry, isn't it? With writing like this, a well-thought-out plot, exotic settings and some great action sequences, \\"The Metal Monster\\" does indeed live up to its rep as a fantasy classic. There ARE some unanswered questions by the book's end, but that only adds to the aura of cosmic mystery that Merritt has built up. The book is a winner, indeed.	2004-03-08
US	49963565	RIGW97E5BB01R	0803282680	505152693	The Moon Pool (Bison Frontiers of Imagination)	Books	5	19	20	N	N	A MASTERFUL FIRST NOVEL	A. Merritt's masterful first novel, &quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; originally appeared in the magazine &quot;All-Story Weekly,&quot; as a short story entitled &quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; in 1918. Its full-length sequel, &quot;The Conquest of the Moon Pool,&quot; followed in that pub the following year. The first book publication, later in 1919, combined these two works into a unified whole, and the result is an astonishing piece of fantastic fiction. And it would seem that Orson Welles' radio rendition of H.G. Wells' &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; on 10/30/38 was not the first piece of fantasy to dupe the public, either. Readers of &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; in 1918 were so convinced of the book's veracity that they wrote to &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot; wanting more information. I can easily understand their confusion, as this novel is told in a very realistic style, purportedly from notes that the famous botanist Dr. Walter Goodwin had submitted to the International Association of Science. Goodwin had been en route from Port Moresby, New Guinea to Melbourne when he encountered an old associate, Dr. Throckmartin, who told him a remarkable story. It seems that Throckmartin's entire scientific party had been abducted by a being of light, while they were exploring the (actual) Nan-Matal ruins off Panape, in the Caroline Islands. Throckmartin himself is abducted before Goodwin's eyes, leading to Goodwin's exploration of those same ruins. Throckmartin's tale is eerie and quite suspenseful; indeed, those first 30 pages of the book are so very intense that the reader will be amazed to realize that there's another 250 pages in this novel yet to go! En route to Panape to effect his investigation, Goodwin, through a series of somewhat forced coincidences, encounters a Norwegian captain whose family had been abducted by the strange light entity; a visionary, somewhat fey, Irish fighter pilot; and a duplicitous Russian (German in the original magazine version!) scientist, all of whom accompany him on his adventures. And this is just the introductory setup in what turns out to be a long, involving, at times hallucinatory, and all in all quite remarkable tale. Underground civilizations, invisibility cloaks, giant jellyfish, disintegrating beams, good and evil priestesses, battles involving thousands, frogmen, shell-shaped flying cars...Merritt's imagination seems to be bursting loose in this, his first work. Much has been said regarding the fact that Merritt, a newspaperman for the most part (for many years on &quot;The American Weekly&quot;), could switch so easily from dry journalese to the florid, purple prose that soon became his trademark. This book would not be what it is without his dense, adjective-heavy, hyperimaginative prose, with its wide range of reference and yearning lyricism. Just take this example, in which the author describes the flora of the underground world that Goodwin &amp; Co. discover:<BR>     &quot;...moss veils like banners of a marching host of Titans; pennons and bannerets of the sunset; gonfalons of the Jinn; webs of faery; oriflammes of elfland! Springing up through that polychromatic flood myriads of pedicles--slender and straight as spears, or soaring in spirals, or curving with undulations gracile as the white serpents of Tanit in ancient Carthaginian groves--and all surmounted by a fantasy of spore cases in shapes of minaret and turret, domes and spires and cones, caps of Phrygia and bishops' mitres, shapes grotesque and unnameable--shapes delicate and lovely! They hung high poised, nodding and swaying--like goblins hovering over Titania's court; cacophony of Cathay accenting the &quot;Flower Maiden&quot; music of &quot;Parsifal&quot;; bizarrerie of the angled, fantastic beings that people the Javan pantheon watching a bacchanal of houris in Mohammed's paradise!&quot;<BR>    Despite the reader's desire to flip through the pages breathlessly to see what happens next, prose such as this almost demands a more leisurely pace. I found myself rereading many such passages, just reveling in Merritt's ability to conjure up dreamlike word pictures. But strangely enough, although he is extraordinarily good with these descriptions, sometimes Merritt overreaches himself, and then his attempts to picture things fall flat. I defy any reader to fully visualize Goodwin &amp; Co.'s means of descent into the Murian underworld, for instance, or the geography of the bridge leading to the Portal. But for the most part, Merritt's prose is extremely effective at conveying a sense of alien wonder, and &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; does indeed live up to its reputation as a fantasy classic. I recommend it wholeheartedly to all amazon.com readers.	2004-02-11
US	49963565	R16MD0HM5JX1VN	0899684378	591216736	Burnt Offerings	Books	5	47	49	N	N	A GREAT, SCARY, FIRST NOVEL	For all those folks who have at times felt that their home and possessions owned them, rather than the other way around; for those folks who love a good haunted house/possession tale; and even for those readers who simply enjoy a well-told thriller of a pageturner, Robert Marasco's 1973 novel &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; will be a real find. This was Marasco's first novel in a sadly unprolific career; he came out with only two more titles--&quot;Child's Play,&quot; a drama, in 1970, and &quot;Parlor Games,&quot; a Gothic-style mystery, in 1979--before succumbing to lung cancer in 1998, at the age of 62. A real loss, if &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; is any indication of the man's skills. In this work, we meet Ben and Marian Rolfe, a nice, ordinary couple from Queens, who, with 8-year-old son David and elderly Aunt Elizabeth in tow, rent an aging mansion on Long Island's North Fork. This property is let for the unbelievably low price of $900 for the entire summer, with one proviso: The renters' mother will remain in her room for the duration, but will stay out of sight and quite low maintenance. Marasco then begins to gently turn the screws, and before long, but insidiously, horrible things start to transpire. Marian becomes obsessed with keeping house, while her hair quickly grays; Ben starts to physically abuse his son uncontrollably and to suffer morbid hallucinations; and Elizabeth, once spry, starts to age at an alarming rate. It soon becomes obvious to the reader that the house is leeching the life out of its occupants, while in the process of revivifying itself. And that is just the start of this amazing story.<BR>    Marasco writes extremely well; it is hard for me to believe that this was his first novel. Yes, he is sometimes guilty of the faults of a beginning writer, such as an occasional bit of fuzzy writing and some instances of poor grammar and punctuation (granted, those latter are more the fault of Marasco's editor). But what he excels at is beautifully rendered, realistic dialogue; I've seldom read better. His descriptions of Queens are also dead on the money (I should know; I live there); one can tell that Marasco was a native New Yorker. Perhaps I should also mention here that this book was chosen by no less a luminary than Stephen King for inclusion in Jones and Newman's excellent overview volume &quot;Horror: 100 Best Books.&quot; It is easy to see the influence that &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; had on King's similarly themed &quot;The Shining,&quot; which came out four years later. But &quot;The Shining&quot; has always struck me as an excellent exercise in suspense, rather than being really scary (that bathtub scene excepted, natch), whereas &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; has more scenes guaranteed to send shivers coursing down the spine. Every time Marian goes into mother's sitting room, and looks at the eerie photos on the table, and at that strangely carved door, and listens to the weird hum coming from mother's bedroom...well, it just keeps getting freakier and freakier. Although perhaps not as chilling as Shirley Jackson's classic &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; (but then again, how many books are?), &quot;Burnt Offerings&quot; can even hold its own in that august company. The folks in Richard Matheson's &quot;Hell House&quot; go through no greater horrors than the Rolfes do, either. The Rolfes are a sweet couple, and the reader roots for them, and hopes that they come through their ordeals okay. But with the creeping, living forces of the Allardyce mansion ranged against them, the odds are certainly not in their favor! Anyway, let me just say that I more than highly recommend this book to all amazon.com readers.	2003-12-09

The book consists of short stories that, for the most part, first appeared in the classic pulp magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in the early 1950s; indeed, the book is dedicated to that great magazine, which ended its 31-year run in 1954. Prospective readers of Brennan's collection should be advised that this is NOT an easy book to acquire. It's been out of print for many years, and it took me a half dozen attempts at Ebay auction before I could get my hands on a decently priced copy. But it was worth the trouble. This is an extremely enjoyable bunch of scary stories, and Brennan turns out to be an exceptionally readable author, writing in a clean and forthright style. The 10 stories in this collection run the gamut from the monstrous to the macabre, with many of them of the ghostly variety. <BR>    The book kicks off with a tremendous start with the longest tale, &quot;Slime.&quot; In this story, a monstrous blob of submarine goop gets thrown onto land and starts doing what it does best: devouring things. This is one fun story, almost on a par with H.G. Wells' 1896 tale of submarine monsters invading the English coast, &quot;The Sea Raiders&quot; (and if you knew what high esteem I have for Wells, you would realize that this is high praise indeed!). Next up is a short piece on hypnotism gone awry, &quot;Levitation&quot;; it leaves a vivid impression, despite its brevity. In &quot;The Calamander Chest,&quot; a man discovers that inexpensive furniture may indeed carry a higher price. This is an excellent ghostly tale; I could easily picture it as an EC comic book! In &quot;Death in Peru,&quot; we learn that the practice of voodoo is not confined to Africa and Haiti. This short story leads to an appropriately grisly conclusion. &quot;On the Elevator&quot; and &quot;The Green Parrot&quot; are up next; both are tales of spirits coming back to either harass or perplex the living, and both are finely done. The highly regarded &quot;Canavan's Back Yard&quot; follows, and this story of an accursed piece of real estate is perhaps the creepiest tale in the bunch. Brennan creates a malignant atmosphere with seeming ease in this marvelous piece of sinister witchery. &quot;I'm Murdering Mr. Massington&quot; tells of a man who will do practically anything to be remembered after his death, and the narrator of the tale is, apparently, Brennan himself. This is a simple but clever little story. In &quot;The Hunt,&quot; a man finds himself being pursued for no apparent reason by another man. We only learn the tracker's reason at the very end, and it does come as something of a shock. To wind up the collection, there's &quot;The Mail for Juniper Hill,&quot; in which a postal worker in turn-of-the-century Connecticut does anything to make sure that the mail does indeed get through. I'm not sure whether this is a ghostly tale or not; it's somewhat ambiguous, but still mighty enjoyable reading. All in all, my only complaint with &quot;Nine Horrors and a Dream&quot; is its length. At a mere 121 pages, it can hardly be called a generous collection. Most readers will wish, at the book's conclusion, that it were more like &quot;Twenty Horrors and a Dream.&quot; The book has been chosen for inclusion in Jones and Newman's excellent overview volume &quot;Horror: 100 Best Books,&quot; and I have no problem with that inclusion. It's on the slender side and pulpy as anything, but horror stories don't come much more fun.	2003-12-01

Ron Hubbard's \\"Slaves of Sleep\\" who might be put off by the author's association with the cult of Dianetics and Scientology need not be concerned here. This novel first appeared in \\"Unknown\\" magazine in 1939, more than a decade before Hubbard's first Dianetics article was published (in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\") in May 1950. Thus, in \\"Slaves of Sleep,\\" there's not a mention of \\"auditors,\\" \\"clears\\" or E-meters to be found. Rather, this is an extremely fast-moving and colorful fantasy tale, told with much brio and panache. In it, we meet Seattle shipping magnate Jan Palmer, a rather pusillanimous young man who is falsely accused of the murder of a visiting professor. I'm not giving anything away by saying that this murder was actually the work of the hairy, fanged and 15-foot-tall jinni Zongri, who's not at all grateful after being released from his bottle. (Barbara Eden he ain't!) Jan, the innocent bystander, is cursed by Zongri with \\"eternal wakefulness.\\" Thus, whenever he nods off in his jail cell, his \\"sleep spirit\\" is tranported to an Arabian Nights-style empire, where humans are slaves and jinnis rule, and where he is the swashbuckling pirate Tiger.<br />  This reader has always been fond of any book or film that dishes out two exciting parallel story lines. You know the kind I mean: Just as things come to a head with one of the stories, the scene jumps to the other, and back and forth. Well, \\"Slaves of Sleep\\" does this to a turn, alternating between Jan's plight in his earthly jail cell and his adventures as Tiger the pirate. While back on Earth, Jan faces that murder charge and tries to prevent himself from being locked away in a sanatorium; in the otherworldly Tarbuton, he is captured by the jinni queen and must somehow escape. He is aided in his latter task when he comes to acquire the mystical Seal of Sulayman, and when the personalities of Jan and Tiger start to meld. Yes, this is all pretty way-out stuff, but as I mentioned up top, Hubbard carries it off with great flair.<br />  There are, however, some problems that pop up and prevent me from giving the book a top grade. Hubbard was a notoriously rapid writer, and there are scenes in the book that would have benefitted from some more detail. For example, the descriptions of the Rani temple, which Tiger infiltrates, are very vague, at best; most readers will have to tax their imaginations to adequately picture this stuff. And as the reader below quite accurately points out, the book's conclusion IS rather rushed. In addition, once Jan acquires that Seal of Sulayman, his tasks are waaaay too easily accomplished. When all our hero has to do to sink a ship is say, in so many words, \\"Seal of Sulayman, sink that ship,\\" much of the dramatic tension is removed, although the reader still gets a kick out of this vicarious wish fulfillment. It is easy to tell that Hubbard greatly enjoyed writing this tale, and that enjoyment IS communicated to the reader, but still, this reader was somehow left wanting more. I originally picked up this out-of-print book because of the glowing review in Cawthorn and Moorcock's excellent overview volume entitled \\"Fantasy: The 100 Best Books.\\" Well, I'm not sure that \\"Slaves of Sleep\\" deserves to be on that top 100 list, but I did have fun reading it, and marginally recommend it to all lovers of fast-moving, swashbuckling fantasy fare.top, Hubbard carries it off with great flair.<BR>    There are, however, some problems that pop up and prevent me from giving the book a top grade.

This reader picked up an out-of-print copy recently, after seeing that it had been included in Jones and Newman's excellent overview volume, \\"Horror: 100 Best Books.\\" Well, I don't know if I would place it on MY personal top 100 list, but this book certainly is a unique collection of shuddery, gruesome little tales. Readers looking for horror stories depicting monsters, ghosts, demons and other manifestations of the supernatural would be best advised to look elsewhere; the only monsters in this volume are of the human kind, and the only demons are those found in the minds of the assorted oddball characters. These are all very much (post)modernistic stories, and there are no crumbling castles or Carpathian villages to be found. Some of the tales even take place in the not-too-distant future, and have a decidedly sci-fi overtone. Without exception, every story herein is a distinct little gem, but like gems, some of them are flawed.<BR>    For me, these flaws take the form of either too much or not enough information. In some of these tales, such as \\"You Can Go Now,\\"  Etchison gives us loads of detail, and at the story's end, it all seemingly doesn't add up to very much. In others, such as \\"Today's Special,\\" one feels that not enough has been supplied to fully \\"get\\" the story. Etchison is a very stylish writer--sometimes almost too stylish--and that flashy style often comes at the expense of clarity. Often, these stories must be reread in order to pick up on hints missed on the first go-round. Or perhaps one will feel compelled to reread lines, just to revel in the frequent beauty of the writing. Etchison certainly does have a handy way with a simile; for instance, when he writes \\"...the sky...was turning a soft, tropical orange of the kind one expects to see only on foreign postage stamps.\\" Or when he writes \\"The river smelled like dead stars.\\" Yes, the ol' boy certainly does know how to write descriptive and imaginative prose, and in MOST of the cases here, that prose is in the service of tales that do hit the reader squarely. <BR>    One of my favorite tales in the collection is one of the most straightforward: \\"Daughter of the Golden West.\\" It concerns a bunch of gals who are decidedly, um, man hungry. There is a loosely linked trilogy of tales concerning organ transplants (these are the tales that tend to sci-fi) that are also very well done. Other tales in the book will make readers never look at butcher shops, or salesmen, or clairvoyants, or oral sex, or laugh tracks, or late-night convenience store clerks in quite the same way ever again. For every head scratcher of a story in the book, there are two killers. So yes, the book is a mixed bag of sorts, but even the problematic tales hold one's interest and invite reexamination. After finishing these 16 morbid little stories, I was sorry to see the book end. Etchison's is certainly a unique voice in the horror field, and if other readers have a similar reaction to mine, they will feel compelled to read more of him. This is, as I mentioned up top, an unusual collection, and I do recommend it.	2003-10-23

The literary critic and scholar S.T. Joshi has called this book \\"perhaps the greatest weird collection of all time,\\" and while I do not pretend to be well read enough to concur in that evaluation, I will say that the book is beautifully written...and certainly weird, in Blackwood's best manner. The five pieces in \\"Incredible Adventures\\" are almost impossible to categorize. They're not exactly horror or fantasy tales, but they all share one thing in common: In all of them, Algernon Blackwood--lover of Nature (with a capital \\"N\\") and ever one to seek for the ultimate reality behind the surfaces of what we seem to know--gives us characters who are bettered for their glimpses behind \\"reality's\\" curtain. This is not an easy book to write about, nor are the stories in it by any means light reading. Blackwood was trying to elucidate important points with these tales; to help readers understand their true relation to Nature, and time and space. Sounds like heavy going, I know, but for all lovers of finely crafted albeit unusual tales, this book will be a godsend.<br />  The collection starts off with a bang with one of the novellas, \\"The Regeneration of Lord Ernie.\\" In this tale, a tutor tries to breathe some much-needed spirit into his young ward by exposing him to a pagan ceremony in the Jura Mountains. But things get a little out of control in this very atmospheric tale. Next up is \\"The Sacrifice,\\" one of the shorter pieces, in which a mountaineer who has just undergone some severe life setbacks goes climbing. This story is the most symbolic, surrealistic and ambiguous of the bunch. I don't want to ruin the tale for any prospective readers, so just let me say that I have never read a story quite like it. \\"The Damned\\" is next up, and it is the longest novella in the collection. At first glance a traditional haunted-house story, the tale is soon revealed to gomuch deeper than that. As the author tells us repeatedly, \\"nothing happens\\" in this tale per se; atmosphere is everything, and nobody conveys atmosphere better than Blackwood (as a reading of his classic tale \\"The Willows\\" will surely demonstrate). But it really is remarkable how Blackwood maintains and magnifies this ominous atmosphere over the length of this novella; a really bravura performance. The last of the three long tales, \\"A Descent Into Egypt,\\" immediately follows. In this tale, a group of men in modern-day Egypt find themselves being helplessly drawn back in time (spiritually, at least) by the glamour of that ancient land. This tale just keeps getting weirder and weirder. It is hallucinatory in the extreme; so much so that it makes me wonder why Blackwood was never championed in the 1960s by the same hippie college kids who took so wholeheartedly to Carlos Castaneda and P.K. Dick. Like Dick, Blackwood was very concerned with the reality that underlies our so-called reality. In this Egyptian tale, the land and time of the ancients is the reality; the present day is only the skin on the surface. This really is some amazing work. The book ends on a lovely note with the short story entitled \\"Wayfarers.\\" Here, a man awakens after an auto accident and finds himself in bed a full hundred years earlier! It is a tale of eternal love and reincarnation; the type of tale that H. Rider Haggard would probably have loved, and another beautifully written winner. I should add here that these stories are probably best read and savored slowly, both for their exquisite atmospheres as well as for their deeper meanings. There is a lady here at amazon.com who, at the moment, is the #1 reviewer. She claims to be a speed reader who goes through two books a day! Well, I would like to advise her, and anyone else lucky enough to read this collection, to SLOW DOWN! Savor the language that Blackwood commands, and lines such as this one: \\"The stars turned a shade less brilliant, a softness in them as of human eyes that say farewell.\\" You can't sprint through a botanical garden and expect to appreciate all the wonders therein!<br />  I should also mention that, while I am grateful to Stark House for making this classic, long-out-of-print collection available again, I deplore the sloppiness with which this edition has been put together. I have never read a book with more typographical errors of every description. Besides the run-of-the-mill typos, hyphens and M dashes are routinely intermixed throughout; margins are fouled up; words are omitted from sentences; changes in font size occur; British pound symbols are substituted for the letter \\"f\\"; words are repeated; boldface words appear for no reason; accent marks are at times used for apostrophes; and on and on. I myself am a copy editor and proofreader, and find it amazing that this edition was proofed at all. And yet, uncommonly enough, a credit for the proofreader is given at the front of the book!!! If it were me, I would have had my name deleted, out of professional pride! Stark House has a lot of chutzpah charging $17 for this remarkably messy work. Still, the book IS a collection of wonders, and Blackwood's vision does  shine through. But potential readers would be well advised to do themselves a favor and splurge for an older copy!	2003-10-07
US	49963565	R1HBHL18OH19H	0671656120	993888074	Land of Unreason	Books	3	9	11	N	N	ONE STRANGE RIDE	\\"Land of Unreason\\" first saw the light of day in 1941, in a shorter form, in \\"Unknown\\" magazine; it was later expanded to novel length. Just as there is a genre of science fiction known as \\"hard\\" sci-fi, as typified by the works of Hal Clement and Larry Niven, this novel impresses me as a \\"hard\\" fantasy novel. Not only do authors deCamp and Pratt usher us into Fairyland, and show us the court of Oberon and Titania, but we are also shown all manner of elves, sprites, nymphs, fairies, ogres, kobolds and the like; even a leprechaun and a unicorn are thrown into the mix. <BR>    This journey into the fantastic begins when Fred Barber--an American vice-consul in Spain who has been injured during World War II and who is convalescing on the Yorkshire moors--impulsively drinks the milk that his hostess has superstitiously left for the fairies on St. John's Eve. He is kidnapped by a fairy named Sneckett and brought to Oberon's palace, where he is given the task of going to the Kobold Hills and preventing the kobolds from making metallic swords (a substance that no fairy can touch). Thus, Barber begins his picaresque wanderings, and the reader is propelled into a very strange world indeed. Fairyland has been going through a series of so-called \\"shapings\\"; even the normally bizarre physical laws of the realm don't apply anymore. In his travels, Barber encounters a talking whirlwind, an apple-tree sprite, a monster from a plum tree, and two-headed eagles. He resides for a while with a marooned, 19th century farmer from New England, and is transformed into a frog and, later, a batlike creature, all leading to his ultimate transformation. The reader will never be able to guess where the story is going next; it's one darn thing after another for poor Fred Barber, as he tries to find his way back home. <BR>    Perhaps I have not adequately suggested, in this capsule description, what a very strange book \\"Land of Unreason\\" is. At times I was reminded of Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"; at others, of David Lindsay's weird-in-the-extreme \\"A Voyage to Arcturus.\\" All feature crazy worlds where the physical laws of our reality are in abeyance; all feature strange characters and even stranger events. \\"Land of Unreason\\" even pays homage to Carroll's work, in making Titania's footmen liveried frogs. This is one very bizarre book indeed.<BR>    I should also point out to prospective readers of \\"Land of Unreason\\" that both deCamp and Pratt were history buffs, and that perhaps the most impressive single aspect of this novel is the seemingly authentic medieval manner in which the characters converse. The authors have obviously done their homework, to say the least. Readers of this book will run into many obscure Scottish words and archaic language, as well as loads of unusual English. This reader is a professional copy editor, and even I had to resort to an UNabridged dictionary repeatedly to look up words such as \\"nympholept,\\" \\"strappado,\\" \\"rounce,\\" \\"jobbernowl,\\" \\"equerry,\\" \\"yataghan,\\" \\"lambrequin,\\" \\"armet,\\" \\"thill,\\" \\"armigerous,\\" \\"anlace,\\" \\"cousin-german,\\" \\"alate,\\" \\"oriflamme,\\" \\"crapulous,\\" \\"catenary,\\" \\"pule,\\" \\"thrip,\\" \\"gramercy,\\" \\"widdershins,\\" \\"adossed,\\" \\"barry-wavy,\\" \\"stirk,\\" \\"wight,\\" \\"springald,\\" \\"bedad\\" and \\"metic,\\" among others. The book is a challenge in this respect, but, as always, a little research on the part of the reader will be repaid with a deeper appreciation. On the down side, \\"Land of Unreason\\" contains many plot points that lead nowhere, and the denouement--for me, anyway--is something of a letdown. This reader was thoroughly entertained while reading the book, but was ultimately left with the feeling that he'd read a piece of well-crafted piffle. I should perhaps also mention that this novel has been included in James Cawthorn and Michael Moorcock's overview volume \\"Fantasy: The 100 Best Books.\\" I'm not sure that it deserves inclusion, but it certainly does make for one strange ride.	2003-09-16
US	49963565	R1MRCSN6G0BDZN	0425064255	186333220	Susan Hayward	Books	4	21	21	N	N	A WELL-DONE BUT SLIGHTLY FLAWED BIOGRAPHY OF A GREAT ACTRESS	Brooklyn-born Susan Hayward possessed what was arguably the greatest combination of drop-dead good looks and sheer acting ability that the silver screen has ever known. She has long been a favorite of mine, having starred in quite a few true cinema classics, as well as any number of admirable lesser films. I had wanted to read a biography of the woman for some time, and am happy to report that Beverly Linet's 1980 work, &quot;Susan Hayward: Portrait of a Survivor,&quot; suited my needs quite well. Ms. Linet was a professional acquaintance of Susan's, having worked in Hollywood as a journalist and a publicist in the 1950s and '60s. She was able to interview not only Susan's two twin sons, but also her first husband, Susan's nurse of later days, many of Susan's coworkers, her neighbors and her priest. Many of these interviews were exclusives. Ms. Linet clearly knows and admires her subject, but when she comes to an area that her research has not been able to delve into, she quite rightly admits it. Her biography of this great Hollywood star is written in a seemingly offhand, chatty manner, almost as if the author were telling you Susan's story over drinks in a sitting room. The reader is not burdened down with unnecessary trivia, and the book, at a little over 300 pages in length, moves along briskly. Indeed, there were times when I wished Ms. Linet would linger a while over one or another of my personal favorite Hayward films (such as &quot;Smash-Up,&quot; for instance) for some in-depth treatment. Still, I, a Hayward fan of some 25+ years, learned a large amount from Linet's work. <BR>    We are told the story of Susan's Brooklyn youth, of her early modeling career, her arrival in Hollywood in 1937, and her slow but steady climb to the top, culminating in her Oscar win (for &quot;I Want to Live&quot;) in 1959. But what was most interesting for me was the little-told story of Susan's later years: her second marriage (to a Georgia businessman), her short-lived theatrical career, and her sad final days. Ms. Linet tells Susan's story well; she is a good writer, and arranges her chapters in cliffhanger fashion. She is not averse to telling tales that depict Susan as a prima donna and as a moody recluse. Susan, pro that she was, had her quirks and problems, as do we all, and Linet manages to make her emerge as a well-rounded, complex, but ultimately admirable person. Indeed, Hayward's 27-month fight against cancer will inspire anyone who reads of it. This is one moving biography, indeed.<BR>    That being said, I must also report that Ms. Linet and her editors are guilty of some occasional sloppiness and/or poor fact checking throughout this book. I feel a bit churlish in pointing these things out, but feel I must, as they undermine what is otherwise a very well-researched piece of work. To start with, there are sporadic problems concerning dates. Linet tells us in passing that Warner Baxter won his acting Oscar in 1931; that date should be 1929. She tells us that Lex Barker passed away in 1974, whereas he really died in '73. She mentions a Barbara Stanwyck movie called &quot;The Night Walker&quot; and gives its date as 1968; that should be 1964. She says that January 21, 1971 (the date Susan's Ft. Lauderdale apartment caught fire) was a Friday; in reality, 1/21/71 was a Thursday. Susan's first wedding date is said to be July 24, 1944, but later in the book it is said to be July 23, and elsewhere it is said that &quot;July 16, 1953 [was] six days short of her ninth wedding anniversary.&quot; HUH? Is it the 24th, 23rd or 22nd? Who knows? Or, if Susan was really born on 6/30/17, wouldn't she be approaching 49 when her second husband died on 1/9/66, not 48, as Ms. Linet tells us? Also, we're told that the March 1975 Georgia funeral march for Susan took place 17 years after the parade for her 1959 Oscar win; shouldn't that be 16? Slips like these can really distract a sharp-eyed reader. There are other goofs, as well. The author tells us that the actress Franciska Gaal was Norwegian, whereas in truth she was born in Budapest. She mentions a &quot;Clausen Ave.&quot; near the Brooklyn Museum; that should be Classon Ave. She tells us that the star of the 1924 movie &quot;He Who Gets Slapped&quot; is Lon Chaney, Jr., whereas the date alone should indicate Lon Chaney, Sr.! Hayward's second husband's farm is said to be 40 acres in size; elsewhere, it is said to be 450 acres. An Ellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas is mentioned in the book; that should be Nellis Air Force Base. I could go on, but you get the idea. This book could surely have benefitted from another thorough going-over during the editorial process. Still, it unquestionably reveals much about Susan Hayward that has never been revealed before, and for that reason alone, I highly recommend it to all fans of this great actress, as well as to fans of old-timey movies in general.	2003-09-02
US	49963565	R1YHAOO6W6BRP9	0803273320	538524186	The Lost Continent: The Story of Atlantis (Bison Frontiers of Imagination)	Books	5	21	21	N	N	A WONDERFUL FANTASY	&quot;The Lost Continent&quot; first appeared serially in the English publication &quot;Pearson's Magazine&quot; in 1899, and in book form the following year. The author, C.J. Cutcliffe Hyne, is not exactly a household name today, but, back when, was an extremely popular and prolific writer. His serialized tales of Captain Kettle, also in &quot;Pearson's,&quot; were supposedly only second in popularity to the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot;'s Sherlock Holmes stories, as submitted by Conan Doyle. But today, Hyne's reputation seems to rest solely on this wonderful novel of the last years of the continent of Atlantis. <BR>    The history of these final years is told by the soldier-priest Deucalion, who, at the book's opening, has just been recalled from his 20-year viceroyalty of the Atlantean province of Yucatan. On his return to his homeland, after that two-decade absence, he finds that much has changed. The upstart Phorenice has seized power and declared herself Empress; the capital city boasts many new pyramids but also many new slums; the people are starving and in revolt; the priest clan is challenging the Empress to amend her ways or face the wrath of the High Gods. Yes, it is quite a mess that Deucalion returns home to, and things only get worse when Phorenice takes a hot-blooded fancy to him and decides to take him to husband. Before all is said and done in this fast-moving tale, the reader has been treated to a four-way love triangle (or is that square?), a runaway mammoth, fights with sea monsters and giant cave tigers, pyramid intrigue, a gigantic battle between Phorenice's army and the High Priests (a battle perhaps inspired by those in H. Rider Haggard's lost-world novels), the use of arcane magic and, of course, the final destruction of the continent of Atlantis itself. Hyne writes marvelously, and uses language that is archaic enough to sound authentic but still remains eminently readable. The character of Deucalion is well drawn and quite likeable, despitehis initial aloofness and rigidity; I suppose Hyne would have us believe that this character is the inspiration for the Deucalion of Greek myth. Phorenice makes for a terrific villainess, being beautiful, quite ruthless, lustful, remarkably intelligent, and ambitious. Unfortunately, these very qualities of the Empress lead directly to the downfall of her empire. Besides well-drawn principal and secondary characters, &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; also boasts marvelous detail and color. The capital of Atlantis, as well as its wilder volcanic outer districts, are well depicted, and Hyne tells us something of the lives of the people, the politics and religion of the Atlantean realm. All in all, this truly is a wonderful fantasy, and great escapist entertainment. The University of Nebraska Press, with its Bison Frontiers of Imagination series, is to be commended for making this lost manuscript available again to modern-day readers. I heartily recommend it to all.	2003-08-04
US	49963565	RI49Y8VVKJ3JL	0803298315	685022494	The War in the Air (Bison Frontiers of Imagination)	Books	5	59	64	N	N	A LESSER-KNOWN WELLS MASTERPIECE	&quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; wasn't the only masterpiece that H.G. Wells wrote with the words &quot;The War&quot; in the title. &quot;The War in the Air,&quot; which came out 10 years later, in 1908, is surely a lesser-known title by this great author, but most certainly, in my humble opinion, a masterpiece nonetheless. In this prophetic book, Wells not only predicts World War I--which wouldn't start for another six years--but also prophesies how the advent of navigable balloons and heavier-than-air flying craft would make that war inevitable. Mind you, this book was written in 1907, only four years after the Wright Brothers' historic flights at Kitty Hawk, and two years BEFORE their airplane design was sold to the U.S. Army for military purposes. In &quot;The War in the Air,&quot; Wells also foresees air battles, as well as engagements between naval and aerial armadas. His gift of peering into the future is at times uncanny.<BR>    We see this worldwide war through the eyes of Bert Smallways, a not terribly bright Cockney Everyman who is accidentally whisked away in a balloon and lands in Germany right on the eve of that country's departure for war. Bert is brought on board one of the German airships, and so personally witnesses a titanic battle in the North Atlantic; the Battle of New York (in which the length of Broadway is destroyed and many buildings near downtown City Hall Park are levelled, looooong before 9/11); and the huge fight between the German and Asiatic forces over Niagara Falls. And these are just the start of Smallways' adventures. Wells throws quite a bit into this wonderful tale, and the detail, pace and characterizations are all marvelous. But this isn't just an entertaining piece of futuristic fiction; it's a highly moral one as well. The author, in several beautifully written passages, tells us of the terrible waste of war, and the horrors that it always entails. In this aspect, it would seem to be a more important work of fiction than even &quot;The War of the Worlds.&quot; While that earlier work might be more seminal, this latter tale certainly raises more pressing issues. And those issues are just as worrisome today as they were nearly a century ago. In his preface to the 1941 edition of this book, Wells wrote: &quot;I told you so. You damned fools...&quot; As well he might! And it would seem that we STILL haven't learned the lessons that Wells tried to teach us so many years ago.<BR>    Perhaps, at this point, I should mention that readers of this novel will be faced with many geographical, historical and vocabulary/slang terms that they may not be familiar with. If those readers are like me, they will take the time to research all those obscure terms; it will make for a richer reading experience, as always.<BR>    I said before that this novel is a masterpiece, and yet, at the same time, it is not perfect. Wells does make some small booboos in prediction, for example. Zeppelins were not more important than airplanes in war; civilization did not collapse after World War I. He tells us that the distance from Union Square to City Hall Park is under a mile, whereas any New Yorker could tell you that it's more like two. Wells mentions that the Biddle Stairs (which were built in 1827, led from Goat Island to the base of Niagara Falls, and were demolished in 1927) were made of wood, while in fact they were made of metal and encased in a wooden shaft. But these are quibbles, and in no way detract from the quality of the work. Indeed, this is a novel that should be  mandatory reading for all politicians, not to mention all thinking adults.	2003-07-14
US	49963565	R1W2KPH95P4BPY	1588277682	638473030	Beatrice	Books	4	17	17	N	N	A DIFFERENT TYPE OF HAGGARD NOVEL	&quot;Beatrice&quot; was first published in 1890, and was H. Rider Haggard's 10th novel, out of 58 titles. Unlike so many of his other books, &quot;Beatrice&quot; is one that features almost no action scenes whatsoever; no lost races, no adventure, no battles, no supernatural elements. What it IS, is a beautifully written romance novel; indeed, is is one of Haggard's most emotional works. It tells the story of the ill-fated love affair between Beatrice Granger, an unmarried Welsh school teacher, and Geoffrey Bingham, an unhappily married barrister who lives in London. This all starts after Beatrice saves Geoffrey's life in a canoeing accident during a tremendous storm (in the book's only true action set piece), and the two become interested in one another. Trouble awaits, in the form of Bingham's wife Honoria (who's only interested in money and social climbing), Owen Davies (one of the richest men in Wales, who is morbidly obsessed with marrying Beatrice), and Elizabeth (Beatrice's older sister, who will do just about anything to marry Davies herself). So where in other books we might encounter a three-way love triangle, here we have what might be called a love...pentagon? <BR>    I said before that this book contains no supernatural elements, but this is not quite true. Beatrice and Geoffrey do seem to have some kind of psychic link with one another, so that at times they can sense each other's thoughts and feelings, even when separated. Haggard's recurring theme of eternal love--of a love that survives beyond the grave--is very much in evidence in &quot;Beatrice.&quot; This is a theme that was given play in his very first novel, &quot;Dawn&quot;; was much stressed in the four &quot;She&quot; novels; and appears in so many of his other works. Another theme that &quot;Beatrice&quot; seems to stress is the undesirability of the Victorian marriage state. Apparently, back in the late 19th century, divorce was seen to be a scandalous option, even for the most unhappilymarried couples. Haggard here shows us one such couple, and the problems that arise when this unfortunate union continues. Strangely, the author seems to have no sympathy for the problems that afflict Beatrice and Geoffrey as their romance continues. He even says so, in so many words. One must read between the lines to realize that Haggard does indeed feel for these poor unfortunates.<BR>    Of all the Haggard novels that I have read (two dozen or so), this one seemed to me the most dated. It is hard to believe that so much scandal could attach to a couple because of a love affair. But hold on a moment! Didn't our 42nd president get himself into major &quot;mishegas&quot; as a result of his dalliance with an unmarried woman? Indeed, wouldn't a single school teacher in a small town TODAY find herself embarrassed if her affair with a married man of prominence were to come to light? Perhaps things haven't changed so much after all! (Although it is doubtful that a scandalized woman of today would go to the extremes that Beatrice goes to to put matters right!)<BR>    &quot;Beatrice,&quot; then, is NOT a novel for those looking for an action and adventure spectacle. But for those wishing a deliciously written novel with characters you can really care for, this might be just the ticket. At one point in this tale, Geoffrey thinks about sitting down one night with a good novel, and Haggard tells us that Bingham was &quot;not above this frivolous occupation.&quot; Reading Haggard's &quot;Beatrice,&quot; however, does not strike me as a &quot;frivolous occupation.&quot; It is a serious-minded novel that the author obviously felt deeply about, and one that I do recommend highly.	2003-06-16

Rider Haggard's rarer titles. The idea for this short novel came to Haggard, he states in the book's preface, after he had read a newspaper account of a hare that had swum out to sea to avoid being captured by pursuing hounds. In Haggard's story, the self-called mahatma--a spiritual man who is able, when asleep, to view \\"The Great White Road\\" on which the souls of those recently departed enter heaven--encounters the hare of the title after that animal's death. The hare tells the mahatma of the hardships and cruelties of his recent life: of how his entire family had been hunted to extinction; of his narrow escapes from hunters, greyhounds, and other hunting dogs; and, finally, of how he met his end. The hare also gets to debate the issue of animal rights with his chief hunter/enemy, near the book's end. This hunter is given time to plead his case, but Haggard's sympathies (and the reader's) are certainly with the poor, oppressed hare. This is a book that animal-rights activists will just adore, not to mention those readers who loved Richard Adams' \\"Watership Down.\\" It is simply but beautifully written by Mr. Haggard; his only piece of fiction from the period 1910-11. Haggard, who himself had been an ardent hunter all his life, supposedly gave up the sport after writing this book. But strangely, despite Rider's future abstinence from hunting after this time, he continued to write of this sport in his future novels, especially those dealing with Allan Quatermain. But then again, Quatermain's profession WAS big-game hunting. <BR>    \\"The Mahatma and the Hare\\" is short enough to be easily read in one or two sittings and, with its fablelike quality, is even suitable for the kiddies. Although it shares many of the concerns found in other Haggard novels (spiritualism, afterlife, game hunting), the presentation here is quite different. The author is decidedly trying to alter readers' outlooks and morals with this book, but somehow, the light, simple tone prevents things from getting too preachy. <BR>    This may be a harder Haggard title to find in its original form, but the copy that I recently read, from Ayer Publishers, is a reprint edition that came out in 2000. It is a facsimile copy of the original Longmans, Green edition, and includes a dozen beautiful illustrations by W.T. Horton and H.M. Brock. For those not willing to shell out major bucks for a first edition, the Ayer volume is a great deal. The book is a real charmer, and I do recommend it.	2003-05-27
US	49963565	R1O2QDMTQ49C3K	1587154986	32520334	Mr. Meeson's Will	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A LESSER BUT STILL MIGHTY FUN HAGGARD	\\"Mr. Meeson's Will\\" was first printed in book form in October 1888, after having first appeared earlier that year in \\"The Illustrated London News.\\" It was H. Rider Haggard's 11th novel (out of 58), and one in which his experiences as both a writer and aspiring lawyer were given vent. The novel is at once a tale of adventure, a critique of the publishing industry in late 19th century England, and a satire on the English legal system. In the book's first half, Augusta Smithers--our heroine and a successful author, who has unwittingly entered into an unfair contract with Meeson's publishing firm--takes passage on board a steamship bound for New Zealand, where she hopes to make a fresh start. Her enemy, Mr. Meeson himself, is on board the same boat, coincidentally, and when the ship sinks after a catastrophic collision with a whaler (in a disaster scene that predates a similar, fictional shipwreck in Haggard's 1905 novel, \\"The Spirit of Bambatse,\\" not to mention the real-life Titanic disaster of 1912), Augusta, Meeson and several others are washed up on one of the lonely Kerguelen Islands, in the south Indian Ocean. Before his death, Meeson decides to alter his will and, having no other means of doing so, has that testament tattooed upon Augusta's back! This sets up the story for the book's second half, in which a huge court battle takes place regarding the validity of this document. What might have turned out to be a dry exposition of legal procedures in another author's hands is handled quite entertainingly by H. Rider, and the result is a book of adventure in the first half--the shipwreck and marooning scenes are especially fun--and interesting court battles in the second. Haggard must have greatly enjoyed exposing the unfair practices of the publishing system that had tried to cheat him during his early career, much as Meeson & Co. had cheated Augusta. The book, though a lesser title in Haggard's bibliography--and probably a seldom-read one today, at least as compared to such other Haggard titles as \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" and \\"She\\"--offers ample entertainment value for the modern-day reader, and I do unreservedly recommend it. This book was, by the way, made into a film starring Lon Chaney in 1916, and called \\"The Grasp of Greed.\\" If it's half as good as its source novel, I would love to see it one day.	2003-05-21
US	49963565	R159GHE7XZE21M	158715112X	386381700	Jess	Books	5	18	18	N	N	A LESSER-KNOWN HAGGARD MASTERPIECE	\\"Jess\\" was first published in the UK in March 1887, and was H. Rider Haggard's 5th novel out of 58. Haggard wrote this book toward the end of 1885...and, remarkably, in just nine weeks! But then again, this is the same man who, earlier in 1885, was able to write the astounding sequel to \\"King Solomon's Mines,\\" \\"Allan Quatermain,\\" in just 10 weeks, and who, in 1886, wrote the seminal fantasy \\"She\\" in just six! Haggard has been accused of being a careless writer, but that is certainly not the case with \\"Jess.\\" It is an elegantly written novel, sometimes even poetically written. <BR>    The story takes place during the time of the first Boer War, in 1880-81. Captain John Niel comes to work on the Transvaal farm of a fellow Englishman, Silas Croft, and becomes involved in a love triangle of sorts with Croft's two nieces. One of them, Bessie, is a pretty, hardworking blond; the other, Jess, is plainer looking, intellectual, and deep thinking. Niel becomes engaged to Bessie, but after being trapped with Jess in the siege at Pretoria, realizes that he is in love with her. This makes for quite a mess for these people of high honor. To add to the problems, Haggard throws in one of his best villains, Frank Muller, an Anglo-Boer who has designs on Bessie himself and who wants to kill off the rest of her family, steal their farm, become a great Boer leader and ultimately rule all of South Africa as some kind of monarch. Muller is a truly memorable and hissable villain; extremely handsome, and with a flowing blond beard, full of contradictions and yet quite intelligent, he really does impress. \\"Jess\\" contains none of the supernatural or lost-race elements that many Haggard fans have come to expect from his novels. It is rather an extremely believable adventure and love story. This is not to say that the book is short in the action department, however. It does take place, after all, in the middle of a war, and features many scenes of fighting, attempted murder by that hissable Muller, a deadly fight with an ostrich (sounds funny, I know, but it's not), wild-game hunting, and so on. Haggard himself lived in South Africa during the time of that first Boer War, and was also an ostrich farmer for a short while, and those six years that he spent in the country (from 1875-1881) really gave him the tools with which to authentically depict his stories. It might be a good idea for a reader going into this book to do some minor research on that first Boer War--nothing too serious; just a little background work--for a fuller appreciation of the authenticity of this novel, but it isn't absolutely necessary. <BR>    Besides showing Haggard's great gift for adventure, action, romance and historical retelling, \\"Jess\\" also amply displays the author's gift for what I guess might be called poetic metaphor. Consider this paragraph, in the book's first chapter, in which Captain Niel watches a small whirlwind on the African veldt and compares it to his own life: \\"It's just like a man's life...coming from nobody knows where, nobody knows why, and making a little column of dust on the world's highway, and then passing away and leaving the dust to fall to the ground again, and be trodden under foot and forgotten.\\" \\"Jess\\" is full of beautifully written passages like this one, as well as many of the author's side comments on life and death. The book really does have something in it for everyone, and it is no mystery why the book was a huge best-seller in its day. Now, the book is all but forgotten, and even many fans of H. Rider Haggard have not had a chance to discover its many fine qualities. But it is a book that will amply reward anyone who takes the trouble to seek it out. I more than highly recommend it.	2003-05-08

The first, \\"John Carter and the Giant of Mars,\\" first appeared in \\"Amazing Stories Magazine\\" in January 1941; the second, \\"Skeleton Men of Jupiter,\\" first appeared in that same publication in February 1943. (For full details on the complicated publishing histories of these tales, I refer all interested parties to the ERB List, one of the best Burroughs Websites on the Net.) As most people seem to know by now, the first of these tales was NOT written by ERB himself, but rather by his son, John Coleman Burroughs, who illustrated 13 of his father's books and drew the John Carter comic strip from 1941-43. In this tale, Carter is captured by Pew Mogel, a synthetic man who is bent on conquering Barsoom with his intelligent apemen and flying malagors. The tale is an important one in the Carter saga, in that his city of Helium is almost sacked and captured at the end of a tremendous battle. Sad to say, however, Burroughs Jr.'s writing style is not up to the task of depicting such colossal doings. So this pastiche of a tale comes off like the work of a talented amateur, even though Burroughs Sr. supposedly did assist in the writing. Burroughs Jr. makes many mistakes in his writing; internal inconsistencies and inconsistencies with previous Carter books abound. For example, the characters refer to Barsoom as \\"Mars\\" in this book, and the two moons, Thuria and Cluros, are for the first time given their Earth names of Deimos and Phobos. These moons are said to travel quickly across the sky, whereas in every other Carter book, it has been said that Cluros is a very slow mover. Pew Mogel slaps Tars Tarkas, Carter's Tharkian buddy, in one scene, yet in previous books, it has been established that Tarkas is around 15 feet tall! One of the intelligent apemen falls out of a high window to his death in a courtyard in one scene, even though the characters are in an underground laboratory! The Martian rats that play such a central role in this story are made to appear similar in size to the Earth variety, whereas in previous volumes, they were said to be as big as Airedale terriers! For the first time in the entire series, the men of Barsoom are shown using radios, TV sets and visiscreens; a rather surprising advent, given all that has come before. I could go on, but you get the point. Anyone who has read the previous 10 Carter books will immediately notice the difference in style and content, and that difference is very jarring. Still, the story moves along very briskly, and the action IS relentless.<BR> The \\"Skeleton Men...\\" tale is much better. This novella was written by ERB himself, and is a real return to form. In this one, Carter and his mate are kidnapped by the Morgors of the planet Jupiter, who intend to study them preparatory to their invasion of the Red Planet. This is the first Carter tale to take place on a planet other than Earth or Mars, and so Burroughs is given free rein to let his imagination fly. This story features some good scientific speculation on what that giant world might be like, and for once Burroughs makes no slips as far as inconsistencies are concerned. However, the story ends right in the middle of Carter's adventure; apparently, Burroughs intended this to be a multipart saga, but never did get around to finishing it. Talk about leaving the reader wanting more! But at least the story of John Carter ends on a high note here, bringing to a conclusion one of the best swashbuckling fantasy series of all time.<BR> Perhaps this is as good a place as any to note that the 11 Carter books that I have just read were the Ballantine/DelRey paperbacks of the late '70s to early '80s. These are the ones that feature beautifully imaginative yet faithful-to-the-story cover art by Michael Whelan. Sad to say, these paperbacks are quite a mess. I have never seen books with more typographical errors in my life. It is painfully obvious that these books were never proofread. This is surprising, given the sterling job that Ballantine/DelRey did with their \\"Best of\\" series of 21 great sci-fi authors around that same time. Still, the power of Edgar Rice Burroughs' vision shines through, so that even in these poorly put-together editions, the saga of John Carter on the planet Barsoom manages to captivate the reader, even after all these years.	2003-04-24

US	49963565	R3DTOD2XXYKAFU	0345235878	488459627	Llana of Gathol (Mars #10)	Books	4	6	7	N	N	A LIGHTHEARTED PACKET OF WONDERS	\\"Llana of Gathol\\" is the 10th of 11 John Carter of Mars books that Edgar Rice Burroughs left to the world. This book is comprised of four linked short tales that first appeared in \\"Amazing Stories Magazine\\" from March to October 1941. Each of these stories is around 50 pages in length and is made up of 13 very short chapters. In the first tale, \\"The Ancient Dead,\\" John Carter goes for a spin in his flier to get away from it all, and winds up in the ancient Barsoomian city of Horz. This long-dead city, however, turns out to be anything but. In \\"The Black Pirates of Barsoom,\\" Carter discovers an enclave of the First Born (last seen in book 2, \\"The Gods of Mars\\") and is forced to fight in their gladiator-style games. In \\"Escape on Mars,\\" Carter goes to the aid of the besieged city of Gathol, and winds up stealing a battleship and putting together an untrustworthy crew of mercenaries and assassins. Finally, in \\"Invisible Men of Mars,\\" Carter and his granddaughter, the eponymous Llana, come upon the lost city of Invar, and its invisible inhabitants. Space does not permit me to go into the remarkable plot twists and surprises that this book offers. Each of the tales is a little gem of swift-moving action, but this time presented with a decidedly lighthearted touch. For all the serious goings-on, this Carter volume features the most humor yet seen in the series. This combination of deadly action, presented with a light tone, is a very appealing one. The book is also something of a nostalgia piece; of all the books in the series, this one refers back to events in previous volumes more than any of the others. Indeed, I can hardly see how a reader could really enjoy this collection without a thorough knowledge of ALL the previous entries in the series. And in addition to previous events being referred to, we also see, in \\"Llana of Gathol,\\" the return of several characters from earlier volumes: Ptor Fak from \\"A Princess of Mars,\\" Tan Hadron from \\"A Fighting Man of Mars,\\" Zithad from \\"The Gods of Mars\\" and so on. This harking back to old events and characters strikes me as being not repetitive, as some readers have claimed, but a nice, almost nostalgic tribute to past events. The book also features one of the longest and nastiest sword fights that Carter has ever engaged in; the one with Motus, in the city of Invar. This is one memorable sequence, indeed. Carter is told several times during the course of this novel, by one or another of his many enemies, that \\"Resistance is futile.\\" I can't help wondering whether the creators of Star Trek's Borg menace were Burroughs fans! Anyway, these short-story gems will certainly entertain any lover of fast-moving sci-fi/fantasy.<BR>    All of which is not to say that the book contains no problems, however. Like ALL the previous books in the Carter series, this one contains some doozies. For example, the use of outrageous coincidence, while frequent in past volumes, is waaay overused in this book. I refer here to the coincidence of bumping into Llana in Horz and the coincidence of meeting the brother of Janai (heroine of book 9, \\"Synthetic Men of Mars\\"), not to mention the coincidence of meeting all the other \\"old friends\\" mentioned above. Worse still is the fact that by the book's end, the fate of several of the main characters remains unknown; e.g., the fate of Hin Abtol, the main villain of the saga, and of Tan Hadron and Fo-Nar. We are told by Carter at one point that he will soon explain how the First Born have come to be in the lost rift valley, but he never gets around to it. There are the usual inconsistencies that pop up, too: Why do the CLOTHES of the invisible inhabitants of Invar become invisible also? Why haven't  the CLOTHES of the living dead in Horz not long since disintegrated? How is Carter able to read the hieroglyphs on the king's crown in Invar, when in previous books Burroughs has told us that each city has its own written symbols? Why is it necessary for Hin Abtol's ships to drop men with equilibrimotors (flying belts) into the besieged city of Gathol, when these soldiers could just fly in themselves? I should perhaps add at this point that I have been told by one of the founders of the ERB List (the best Burroughs Website that any fan could ever hope for) that many of these errors and discrepancies are absent from the original versions of the Carter books, but only added later by addle-brained copy editors. I can only speak of what I have read (the Ballantine/DelRey paperbacks from the early '80s), and these books are something of a mess. Still, the vision of Burroughs does manage to shine through, and despite the glitches, this book is a veritable packet of wonders.	2003-04-11

It first appeared serially in \\"Argosy Magazine\\" in early 1939, and is one of the most way-out entries in the Carter series. The book may be seen as a sequel of sorts to book #6, \\"The Master Mind of Mars,\\" in that Ras Thavas, the eponymous superbrain of that earlier work, here makes a return, and the bulk of the action once again takes place in the dismal and forbidding Toonolian Marshes of Barsoom (Mars, to you and me). In \\"Synthetic Men,\\" Carter and one of his lieutenants, Vor Daj, go in search of Ras Thavas, to enlist his aid when Carter's wife is critically injured in a midair collision. Thavas is engaged in creating an army of synthetic men (the so-called hormads), who have taken over an island in the Toonolian Marshes, made an unwilling slave of Ras Thavas himself,  and are now plotting to take over all of Barsoom. Things get pretty wild when Vor Daj has his brain put into one of the hormad's bodies, so that he might better protect a pretty female prisoner who is being held on the island also. Then things go over the top completely, as one of the vats in which the hormads are created goes blooey, and a giant blob of living tissue spreads and spreads and threatens to envelop the entire planet! This blob is comprised of living heads and hands and other body parts; it feeds on itself and seemingly cannot be stopped. All this takes place in the first half of the novel; things get even hairier, if possible, in the final stages of the tale. Before all is said and done, we have been treated to a civil war amongst the hormads, an escape through the swamps of Toonol, encounters with giant insects and reptiles, a marsupial society, wild swamp savages, a Martian zoo, a tense little air battle, and the final confrontation with that living blob mass. It's as if Burroughs ate a headcheese and Fluffernutter sandwich before going to bed one night, had the wildest dream, and thenext morning put it down on paper. The book has nice touches of incidental humor, and Vor Daj's predicament of being trapped in the body of a monstrous hormad while trying to win the affection of the girl of his dreams is an involving one. This leads to John Carter delivering one of his most touching lines: \\"It is the character that makes the man...not the clay which is its abode.\\" So what we have here is a fantastic tale of wild imagination, with some touching passages and incessant action. <BR>    So why, then, have I only given this novel three stars? Well, as with most Carter novels, there are problems of inconsistency, and this novel contains one of the worst in the entire series. During the swamp escape, Vor Daj is accompanied by a party of five others, including a man named Gan Had, who later deserts him. Later in the book, it is stated that this deserter was named Pandar, one of the others of the five. The two characters are mixed up and confused by Burroughs for the remainder of the book, to the point that the reader doesn't know who Burroughs is talking about. This is a terrible and egregious error, I feel. I have discussed it with the founder of the ERB List, a really fine Burroughs Website, and he has told me that he and others have concocted some explanations for this seemingly incredible screwup, while admitting that the reader must read between the lines and do some mythmaking of his/her own to explain it. This giant problem aside, there is also the inconsistency of a character named Ur Raj, who is said to hail from the Barsoomian nation of Ptarth, and four pages later is said to be from the nation of Helium. This is the kind of sloppiness that I, as a copy editor, find especially deplorable. I also regret the fact that the ultimate fate of some of the book's main characters (Sytor, Gan Had and Ay-mad) is never mentioned. Another example of careless writing, I feel. \\"Synthetic Men of Mars\\" is a wonderful entertainment, but could have been made so muchbetter by the exercise of just a little more care on the part of the author and his editors. Still, I quite enjoyed it, and do recommend it to any lover of fantastic literature.	2003-04-03
US	49963565	R3C9CME2SUIFOW	0345329562	73961624	Swords of Mars: (#8) (Martian Tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	AS FUN AS THEY GET	\\"Swords of Mars\\" is the 8th of 11 John Carter of Mars books that Edgar Rice Burroughs gave to the world. It first appeared serially in the \\"Blue Book Magazine\\" in six parts, from November 1934 to April 1935, and is one of the best in the Carter series. For the first time since book 3, \\"The Warlord of Mars,\\" Carter himself takes center stage, rather than making a brief cameo appearance, and his return as the lead character is perhaps the best single element of this book. This time around, Carter goes to the Barsoomian city of Zodanga to put an end to the assassins guild that is thriving there. In the first half of the novel, Carter goes undercover to infiltrate this Murder Inc.-type of organization, and this segment is extremely tense and exciting. In the second half, Carter's wife, Dejah Thoris, in what to any reader of this series must come as an instance of Dejah vu (sorry...couldn't resist!), is abducted again, and Carter follows her kidnappers to one of the Martian moons, using one of that planet's first spaceships. His subsequent adventures on the moon propel the reader into the realm of pure fantasy. Both parts of the novel are as fun as can be, although very much different in tone. <BR>    This novel features very few of the inconsistencies--both internal and with other books in the series--that mar every previous Carter novel. There are some, however. For example, the great Scarlet Tower of Greater Helium is referred to in this book, whereas in previous novels, this tower was referred to as being in Lesser Helium, and besides which, was destroyed in book 5, \\"The Chessmen of Mars.\\" More of a problem in the current volume are the book's implausibilities. For example, Carter & company jump out of their spaceship on that Martian moon, without bothering to check on the moon's breathable air. Fortunately, the air is just fine, thank you, although Burroughs makes nothing of this...surprising, given the pains he had taken in previous books to explain the breathableair on Mars itself. The invisibility-inducing hypnosis that the moon people use against Carter is a bit much to buy, but that's alright; it's all in good fun. But Burroughs' theory that a person who lands on this 7-mile-wide moon would be the same relative size that he would be on Mars--in other words, that he would shrink in proportion to the planetoid's mass; his so-called \\"compensatory adjustment of masses\\"--is, as Carter puts it, \\"preposterous,\\" though, as it turns out, such is the case in the book. Like I said, it's all in good fun. And this book IS as fun as they get. <BR>    Oh...one other nice touch. As pointed out in the ERB List, a fine Burroughs Website, if you take the first letter of each first word of each chapter in this book, you will find a secret message that Burroughs incorporated for his new bride. A nice touch.	2003-03-25
US	49963565	R3SYX7CEXDUNBJ	9994442562	249061612	Fighting Man of Mars	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A BIG ENTRY IN THE CARTER SERIES	\\"A Fighting Man of Mars\\" is book 7 of 11 John Carter novels that Edgar Rice Burroughs gave to the world. It first appeared serially in \\"The Blue Book Magazine\\" from April-September 1930, and, at almost 250 pages, is the longest of all the Carter novels. As in the previous three books in the series, Carter himself only makes a few token appearances, the action mantle this time falling on a distant relation of his, Tan Hadron. As Carter did for Dejah Thoris in books 1-3, and Carthoris did for Thuvia in book 4, and Gahan did for Tara in book 5, Hadron in book 7 goes on a quest to save a woman who has initially spurned him. This IS a big book in the Carter series, as I have said, and Burroughs throws in everything but the proverbial kitchen sink to entertain the reader. Whereas previous books generally featured two or three enemy nations and their leaders, this book has a full six: the dead city of Xanator, with its fierce green warriors; the city of Tjanath, with its despotic ruler Haj Osis; the volcanic realm of Ghasta, with its bestial ruler Ghron; the castle of Jhama, home of the mad scientist Phor Tak; the province of U-Gor, with its cannibal inhabitants; and last but certainly not least, the nation of Jahar, led by the power-crazy Tul Axtar. Instead of one woman that needs saving, and one romantic subplot, this book offers up a full three. The book also lays claim to being the most sci-fi oriented of the lot so far, what with the use of metal-, wood- and flesh-disintegrating weapons, invisibility paint, guided ground-to-air torpedoes and so on. Throw in a scene with a crazed white ape on top of a tower, a humongous killer albino lizard, poison spiders, mucho swordplay, and the mother of all air battles at the book's end and you've got quite a hefty load of fantastic entertainment in your hands. Burroughs certainly gives the reader value for [money] in this one, no doubt. The novel moves breathlessly along from one set piece to the next, never pausing for breath. There are even nice touches of humor to be had; for example, the fact that the scientist, Jason Gridley, at the novel's opening, is from TARZANa, California, of all places! Much as I enjoyed the book, however, I did have some problems with it; numerous problems, actually....<BR>    By now, any reader of this series will be resigned to the unwelcome intrusion of what I like to call I&I: inconsistencies and implausibilities. Like what inconsistencies? In one scene, Burroughs tells us that the distance from Jhama to Jahar is 4,000 haads; a little later on, this distance is said to be 2,500 haads. Things like this can drive an alert reader to distraction! In another scene, it is said that Phor Tak had invented the paint that renders the metal-disintegrating ray useless; but previously in the book, it was stated that that paint was a product of one of his assistants, AFTER Phor Tak had gone into exile! Hadron and his buddy, Nur An, are forced to swim through some underground rapids in one scene, and yet in previous books it had been established that Barsoomians don't, as a rule, know how to swim, due to the dearth of water on their planet! In another scene, Hadron is led to the green warriors' encampment by the loud sounds of their squealing thoats (beasts of burden); so why is he so worried when they start squealing as he makes off with one of them? As far as implausibilities: Hadron and Nur An's balloon escape from Ghasta is extremely hard to swallow. Even harder to buy is the fact that this balloon drifts across the planet and coincidentally lands them right on the roof of the person that they are looking for! As in book 3, it is extremely hard for me to believe that a man can climb up or down the side of a tower at night by grasping onto slight protuberances. It is never explained to the reader how Hadron's invisible ship floated away in Tjanath, and that ship's miraculous reappearance in U-Gor is just totally unlikely in the extreme. Also never explained is how Tul Axtar manages to track down Phor Tak at the book's conclusion; this one really had me scratching my head! The \\"surprise\\" regarding Tavia at the book's end is so very obvious that only the most obtuse of readers will not see it coming; it is so obvious that I wonder if Burroughs really meant it to be a surprise at all. <BR>    Despite all this grousing, I do NOT want to give the impression that I didn't enjoy this book. It fully deserves the four stars that I give it, if only for its great show of imagination and superb pace. Oh yes...there is one other thing that I loved. In one portion of the book, it is said that it is the boast of John Carter--leader of Mars' most powerful army--that he will never fire the first [time] in a war, even though--as in this book--he is faced with a power-mad thug who has accumulated weapons of mass destruction. I have to wonder what Dubya would make of this!	2003-03-14
US	49963565	R15AM6ZT1A9TMP	1400100216	527489366	The Chessmen of Mars	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A NEAR MASTERPIECE	\\"The Chessmen of Mars,\\" Edgar Rice Burroughs' 5th John Carter novel out of 11, first appeared in serial form in the magazine \\"Argosy All Story Weekly\\" from February to April 1922. It is easily the best of the Carter lot to this point; the most detailed, the most imaginative, and the best written. Carter himself only appears at the beginning and end of the tale. Instead, our action heroes are his daughter, Tara, who gets lost in a rare Barsoomian storm while joyriding in her flier and blown halfway across the surface of the planet, and the Gatholian jed Gahan, who goes in search of her. In the first half of this novel, Tara and Gahan wind up in the clutches of the kaldanes--bodiless brains who live in a symbiotic relationship with their headless \\"rykors.\\" One of these brains, Ghek, befriends the couple and tags along with them for the remainder of their odyssey. Ghek is a wonderful character, touching and fascinating and amusing all at once. In one passage, Ghek gives us some very interesting philosophy regarding the relationship between mind and body. In the second half of the book, the trio is captured by the hordes of Manator, and Gahan winds up fighting for Tara in a game of Martian chess, or jetan, a game in which real men are used in lieu of pieces and fight to the death for possession of squares. The jetan sequence is extremely exciting and detailed, and a knowledge of chess is not necessary for full enjoyment. One need not be a chess buff to appreciate the detailed moves that Burroughs gives us. \\"Chessmen\\" is, as I mentioned, very well written for a Burroughs novel; even, dare I say it, poetically written in spots. The action is relentless, the standard of imagination very high, and the denouement extremely satisfying. It is a near masterpiece. Why only \\"near\\"? Well, as is usual with these books, there are some problems....<BR>    As in the previous Carter novels, these problems take the form of inconsistencies and implausibilities. At the book's beginning, Burroughs, who has just been told this tale by Carter himself, writes that \\"if there be inconsistencies and errors, let the blame fall not upon John Carter, but rather upon my faulty memory, where it belongs.\\" He is excusing himself in advance for any mistakes that he might make, and well he should, because there are many such in this book. I, however, cannot excuse an author for laziness and sloppy writing. Saying \\"excuse me\\" doesn't make for good writing. Just what am I referring to here? Let's see.... Tara, in several spots in the book, refers to Tardos Mors as her grandfather, when in actuality he is her great-grandfather. The Martian word \\"sofad\\" is said to be a foot; but in the previous book, \\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars,\\" an \\"ad\\" was said to be a foot. Tara, in one scene, smites Ghek on the back of the head. Gahan is watching this fight from a distance, and sees her hit Ghek in the face! In the game of jetan, the thoat pieces are said to wear three feathers; but in the Rules for Jetan at the book's end, they are said to wear two. This book is based on events told to John Carter, conceivably by Tara, Gahan and/or Ghek, and yet scenes are described in which none of those characters appear; thus, they could have had no knowledge of these events described. This, I feel, is a basic problem with the book's structure. Besides these inconsistencies, there are some things that are a bit hard to swallow. For instance, that Gahan could fall 3,000 feet from a flier in the middle of a cyclone and, freakishly, survive. It's also hard to believe that Tara does not recognize Gahan when he comes to her rescue, and fails to remember where they have met, until the very end of the book. In addition, I feel that the character of Ghek is underutilized in the book's second half. It might have been nice to see the old boy loosening up a bit, as he got more in touch with his emotions, Spockstyle. Anyway, all quibbles aside, \\"Chessmen\\" is a wonderful piece of fantasy, one that had me tearingthrough the pages as quickly as I possibly could. It is an exceptionally fine entry in the John Carter series.	2003-03-07

It first appeared in the magazine \\"Amazing Stories Annual\\" in July 1927, and John Carter himself only puts in a cameo appearance near the book's end. Instead, our hero is another Earthman, Ulysses Paxton, who mysteriously gets transported to Barsoom (Mars) after being critically wounded on the battlefields of WW1. Paxton becomes an apprentice of the eponymous mastermind Ras Thavas, and from him learns all manner of surgical miracles, including brain transplantation. Paxton falls in love with a young woman, Valla Dia, whose body has been sold to an old empress, so that that empress can now live on in her new hotty body. Paxton vows to travel across Mars, kidnap the empress, and restore his beloved's body to her. He enlists the aid of some of Ras Thavas' medical subjects: a Barsoomian white ape with a half-human mind; a professional assassin; and another Martian who has had his body bought/stolen by another. This is a short but extremely entertaining and fast-moving fantasy novel. In it, Burroughs gives us some interesting philosophy on the correlation of mind and body (as he did with the kaldanes in \\"Chessmen of Mars\\"), as well as some interesting speculations on the necessity of war in any culture. He also pokes fun at the mumbo-jumbo aspects of organized religion. So there is some actual food for thought, in addition to the fun. And that equilibrimotor chase and scene in the Temple of Tur ARE very much fun! The heart, lung and other assorted transplants that Ras Thavas is engaged in must have seemed like real sci-fi improbabilities back in 1927, although these things are fairly commonplace today. The brain transplants are another matter, of course. (Perhaps one day...)<br />  \\"Master Mind\\" seems to be slightly better written than some of the earlier Barsoomian novels; Burroughs DID improve with age, at least as far as technique is concerned. Still, there are the usual inconsistencies that crop up. For example, in one scene Thavas complains of the new young blood in his new young body, when it has been established that recipients of new bodies receive their old blood back. I was confused by this. In another scene, the 15-foot-tall ape/man puts on the leather harness of a regular-sized man. Does this seem possible? Clouds are said to obscure the moon in another scene, yet in earlier books, Burroughs has told us that clouds exist on Barsoom only at the poles. A body of a dozen Toonolian soldiers at one point mysteriously turns into 20, and the great scarlet tower of Lesser Helium, which was destroyed in \\"Chessmen,\\" is inexplicably back again in this book. (I grant that it may have been rebuilt, but Burroughs might have said something to this effect.) The surprise regarding Valla Dia at the book's conclusion was one that was so obvious to me that I don't even think it was really meant to be a surprise after all. And here's another quibble: Paxton falls in love with Valla Dia only after he has seen what her actual body looks like. It might have been more effective had he fallen in love with her only AFTER she was trapped in the haggish body of the empress. A young, strapping American male falling in love with an old ugly woman, based solely on her gracious personality. Now THAT would have been a REAL fantasy!are the usual inconsistencies that crop up.

US	49963565	R32VSLXJ4LR51Q	1576466221	527489366	Thuvia, Maid of Mars	Books	4	15	16	N	N	A FAST-MOVING FANTASY	\\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\\" is the 4th of 11 John Carter novels from the pen of Edgar Rice Burroughs. It first appeared in April 1916, as a three-part serial in the magazine \\"All Story Weekly.\\" This is the first Carter novel that does not feature John Carter himself as the central character; he only makes a brief cameo appearance early on. Instead, the action mantle is taken up by Carthoris, Carter's son, but fortunately, Carter Junior turns out to be just as good a swashbuckler as the old man. In this installment, Princess Thuvia of Ptarth has been kidnapped by the spineless Prince Astok of Dusar, which abduction almost causes a world war on Barsoom (Mars). Young Carthoris, in his quest to free his beloved princess, runs across deserted cities, a forgotten kingdom, banths (10-legged Barsoomian lions), ethereal warriors, mucho swordplay, giant white apes, and on and on. As is usual for these books, the amount of action that Burroughs packs into a small compass is quite surprising. Whereas previous Carter books seem to read more like fantasy/fairy tales than science fiction, this installment veers even more to the fantastic, mainly in the use of those phantom warriors just mentioned. These bowmen are called up from the minds of the remaining members of the lost city of Lothar, and have no \\"real\\" concrete existence. However, their arrows can still kill. In this book we also get, for the first time, a nice, detailed look at life in Helium; what the people do, how they live and the like. We also receive a biological explanation of how Carthoris, who was 10 years old but a seeming adult in the previous books, got to be that way. The worldwide peace that apparently prevails at the end of book 3, \\"The Warlord of Mars,\\" is shown in this volume to be not as widespread as was inferred, which makes for some nice tense situations. So this is a good, fast-moving, detailed entry in the series.<BR>    There are some minor problems of inconsistency and fuzzy writing, however, although not as prevalent as in previous entries. For example, in one scene, Carthoris is said to be fighting a force of a dozen Dusarians; three of these are killed, and so three are left. Huh? Carthoris seems to know exactly where to find water in the dead city of Aaanthor, despite the fact that he has never been there before. Wha? Vas Kor, one of Carthoris' chief enemies, fails to recognize him merely because Carthoris is dirty, tired and covered with blood; this is just a bit hard to swallow. Perhaps worst of all, the book ends extremely abruptly, just as all of Barsoom is about to be plunged into that world war. We never learn the fate of several of the main villains, nor do we see the end of hostilities as the realization of the true facts becomes known. This is a short book, and would not have suffered by the addition of such scenes to make it more satisfying. Still, this is a fun entry in the John Carter series, one that all lovers of fast-moving fantasy should enjoy.	2003-02-18
US	49963565	R2B2BSBDN58Z0N	0345324536	73961624	The Warlord of Mars	Books	3	0	1	N	N	AS THRILLING AS THEY COME, BUT...	\\"The Warlord of Mars\\" (1914) is the 3rd of ll John Carter novels from the pen of Edgar Rice Burroughs. It is a direct continuation of the first two in the series--\\"A Princess of Mars\\" and \\"The Gods of Mars\\"--and a reading of those earlier titles is absolutely essential before going into this one. Here, Carter tries to rescue his princess, Dejah Thoris, from the clutches of some particularly nasty villains. In his relentless pursuit, one that makes Indiana Jones look like a slacker, Carter travels from the south pole of Mars to the forbidden lands of the north. He encounters many varieties of monster, such as the apt and the sith, and gets into more fights and cliffhanging situations than a reader would believe could be packed into a mere 160 pages. The pace of the book is furious, never pausing for breath, and the final battle in the north polar city of Kadabra, in which the combined armies of Barsoomian green, red and black men attack the yellow tribes of the north, is thrilling in the extreme. What amazing films these first three John Carter novels would make, if done faithfully and with the requisite ... million thrown into each one!<BR>    So why the 3-star rating? Well, there are numerous problems with the book that prevent me from giving it top grades, despite the fun I had reading it. For one, there are countless inconsistencies and implausibilities. For example, it is difficult for the reader to accept that Carter's enemies cannot recognize him, just because he has smeared some red tint over his skin. Difficult to believe that Carter is able to scale the side of a tower in the pitch black of night. Difficult to believe that Carter (or any  man) could live in a pit for nine days without food and especially water. Verrry hard to believe that Thurid, Carter's archenemy, could carry the struggling captive princess over a foot-wide ledge without toppling into the abyss beneath. Impossible to believe that Dejah Thoris couldn't recognize Carter by his voice alone,despite his yellow-man disguise. All these are hard to swallow in the extreme. As for the inconsistencies: It is stated that Carter saved Thuvia from the Warhoons in book 2, when in actuality it was Carthoris, Carter's son. The city of Kaol is said to be rendered invisible by the forest that surrounds and tops it, but later it is stated that this forest is cut back from the city. Huh? Worst of all is the aforementioned tower-scaling scene, in which dusk becomes early afternoon in a matter of minutes. Here's something that Ed Wood would have appreciated! This day/night confusion is straight out of \\"Plan 9,\\" but for me is the hallmark of incredibly sloppy writing and even poorer copyediting. Further, Burroughs' descriptions of the Valley of the Therns, and its geographic proximity to the land of the First Born, are simply impossible to visualize. Throw in a bunch of misplaced modifiers and some awkward turns of phrase and you've got a real mess of a manuscript. So why did I have a tear in my eye by the book's end, when Carter gets his rewards and the entire city of Helium turns out to greet him? I guess that the power of storytelling can outweigh petty matters of consistency and grammar. And Burroughs WAS a great teller of tales, and this book IS as thrilling as they come.	2003-02-11
US	49963565	R3SBKD8JLQ1WF0	1400100208	355303983	The Gods of Mars	Books	4	9	10	N	N	A TREMENDOUS FEAT OF IMAGINATION	This book, #2 of 11 in Burroughs' John Carter series, is a direct sequel to the classic \\"A Princess of Mars,\\" and a reading of that earlier volume is fairly essential before going into this one. \\"Gods...\\" was first published in serial form in \\"All-Story Magazine\\" in 1913, and comprises one of Burroughs' earliest works. It is amazing how much action the author manages to cram into the book's 190 pages; on just about EVERY page there is some kind of incredible happening or colorful bit. The book really is hard to put down, and yet, at the same time, the end of just about every paragraph could serve as a cliffhanger! The pace of the book is brisk and relentless, and really carries the reader along to another great cliffhanger at the conclusion. In this volume, our hero, John Carter, returns to Barsoom after a decade's absence, and goes to that planet's \\"heaven.\\" But heaven turns out to be anything but, and our man gets caught up in  battles with plant men and white apes, lost civilizations, religious taboos, the plots of an evil \\"goddess,\\" duels in the arena and on and on. There are two action set pieces that Burroughs really puts over well. One is the slave revolt that takes place halfway through the tale; the other, a bravura, four-way air battle between the forces of the black, white, red and green men of Barsoom. Both of these sections are thrilling in the extreme; better than anything in the first Barsoom novel. It's also nice that Carter, an Earthman on Mars, fights alongside men and women of varied races, colors, and religious beliefs in a common cause; there's some kind of message there--one for tolerance and brotherhood--that we could all avail ourselves of today.<BR>    Having said all this, however, I must admit that there are problems in this novel that prevent me from giving it a top grade. These problems mainly take the form of fuzzy writing and internal inconsistencies. Burroughs, in this novel, does not do well in describing geography; his depictions ofthe Valley of the Therns, for example, are almost impossible to visualize (for me, anyway). A map of this planet (such as the one provided in LeGuin's Earthsea books) would have greatly helped, given Burroughs' inability to clearly set out his world. As for the inconsistencies: Burroughs, the \\"editor\\" of the novel, says he first read Carter's manuscript (for Book #1) 12 years previously; but if he had really obeyed Carter's will (that the manuscript not be opened for 11 years), then he would have only first seen the text of \\"A Princess of Mars\\" ONE year before! Tars Tarkas is said to be grieving over his kidnapped daughter in one section of this book; then, a few scenes later, he learns of this kidnapping for the first time. Huh?!?! The scene with Carter on the black-pirate cruiser contains many inconsistencies. Carter is said to be fighting five of these men; he kills three of them, and then three are left. Huh?!?! Six pirates are killed, all told, but later in the book, the number is said to be seven. Carter is said to have killed all these men single-handed, although the Thern princess, Phaidor, had helped him. These pirates are all asleep in the cruiser when Carter comes upon them, although they had been sacking the Thern temple scant minutes before. Does this seem likely? Inconsistencies such as  this can drive an alert reader crazy. And don't even get me started on the redundant expressions such as \\"haven of refuge\\" and \\"craven cowards\\" that pop up all the time.  Burroughs improved with age, but these early books are rife with problems that a good copyediting should have weeded out. Still, these minor problems are easily overlooked when one is caught up in the sweep of the story, and this story is as exciting as they come. It really is a tremendous feat of imagination, and one that any lover of swashbuckling fantasy should hugely enjoy.	2003-02-03
US	49963565	R2W1ZLH1HAQXOR	0345331389	286299382	A Princess of Mars	Books	4	6	7	N	N	A GREAT STORY, BUT WITH CARELESS WRITING	As most of the world already knows, \\"A Princess of Mars\\" is the first of 11 Burroughs novels that tell of John Carter's adventures on the planet Barsoom (Mars, to we Earthlings). This was Burroughs' very first novel, and one of the first books in the swashbuckling space-opera vein; perhaps the very first. It is a marvel of fast-moving action and imagination; indeed, practically every page offers some new marvel or piece of outrageous spectacle. Unfortunately, the book also displays some of the weaknesses of the novice author, but these weaknesses are more than counterbalanced by the pace, color and detail of the story. Burroughs' imagination seemed to be working overtime in this first book. The descriptions of alien life-forms, dead cities, Barsoomian customs and battles are very well drawn, although those battle scenes could have lasted a little longer, for me. (Burroughs might have learned a thing or two from, say, H. Rider Haggard about presenting detailed battle scenes.) There are occasional flashes of strangeness, too; e.g., the ability of Barsoomian psychologists to read the minds of murdered soldiers, and the celibate tax imposed by the Barsoomian government on confirmed bachelors! The book reads more like a fantasy/fairy tale than sci-fi, and the characters are pulpy in the extreme. There are hissable villains, noble warriors, a beautiful princess who needs saving, good and bad monsters, and the like. This book has been so influential that it is amusing, while reading it, to think of all the modern variations. For example, has anybody else been reminded of Princess Leia trapped by Jabba the Hutt of \\"Star Wars\\" fame, when reading of the beautiful Princess Dejah Thoris being leered at by the monstrously huge Thark jeddak, Tal Hajus? So many scenes resonate like that, and the book is almost prototypical in this respect. This is a true classic of the genre.<BR>    However, like I said at the beginning, there are some problems. Besides the outrageous pseudoscience (I refer here to the \\"8th and 9th rays\\" that make possible antigravitation and oxygen manufacture), which I don't mind at all, there are some real discrepancies. For example, in one scene, Carter is said to be riding in his assigned position at the rear of a troop of Tharks; then he is mentioned as being at the very front! Carter is on Barsoom for only a few days before he picks up the Barsoomian vocabulary, which is said to be a simple one. However, he speaks very grandiloquently, as in this sentence: \\"I understand that you belittle all sentiments of generosity and kindliness, but I do not, and I can convince your most doughty warrior that these characteristics are not incompatible with an ability to fight.\\" Pretty good talking, for one who has just learned \\"simple\\" Barsoomian a few days before!!! Another problem I had was the scene in which a body of 150,000 Tharks sneak up on the city of Zodanga, unnoticed and unheard. Does this seem possible? As for the scene in which Carter and Kantos Kan fight in the arena...doesn't all the fighting seem a wee bit too easily accomplished? And then there is the matter of Burroughs' writing itself. I mentioned the common mistakes of a tyro writer. By this, I mean repetitive phrases such as \\"I stole stealthily\\" and \\"essayed...to attempt,\\" as well as endless mistakes of punctuation. I wonder if anybody ever copyedited this book. \\"A Princess of Mars\\" first appeared with the title \\"Under the Moons of Mars\\" in \\"All-Story Magazine\\" in 1912, and I'm not sure whether these magazine stories were edited and proofread or what. The book would not have suffered for a professional once-over. But you know what? In the end, all these little nitpickings matter not a whit, because all the minor problems, as I said, are swept away in the drive and excitement of the great story. And that story is as compelling as they come.	2003-01-24
US	49963565	R1WYCZP3WSCXIP	0786709804	837192300	The Collected Ghost Stories of E. F. Benson	Books	5	11	11	N	N	A GENEROUS AND EXCEPTIONAL VOLUME OF SPOOKY TALES	I had read E.F. Benson's \\"The Horror Horn\\" to start with (a collection of 13 of his best ghost stories), after seeing that it was considered one of the Top 100 Horror Books of all time in Newman & Jones' excellent overview volume. Each of those 13 stories was so good that I just had to have more, and so picked up this collection of every single one of Benson's spooky tales, 54 in all. This collection certainly did not disappoint; I loved every single one of these ghost stories, and was riveted for the full 640-page length of this generous book.<BR>    The tales in this volume are extremely varied. Most deal with ghosts of the conventional kind: the spirits of the deceased with grudges against the living or unfinished business here on the material plane. Unlike the ghosts of Oliver Onions--another great English supernatural writer of the early 20th century, whose ghosts can often be seen more as the mental aberrations of the protagonist--the ghosts of E.F. Benson are decidedly and objectively REAL. There's no question that these occult manifestations are really happening, and not just in the mind of the main character. This--for me, anyway--makes for a more chilling experience. Other tales in this volume deal with vampires, cancer-inducing caterpillars, devil worship, elementals, ghostly slugs, witches and seances. The fact that a character is sympathetic is no guarantee of his or her survival in these Benson stories; anyone is capable of being offed! Indeed, in \\"The Face,\\" one of the scarier stories of the bunch, a kindly woman, a mother of two and a good wife, meets a pretty horrible end for no particular reason. Benson never married, and may have been something of a misogynist; the women in his stories, anyway, are usually given a rough time, or are presented as rather repellent creatures. Take the levitating lead character in \\"Mrs. Amworth,\\" a nice English biddy who just happens to be a blood-sucking vampire; or the bloated and horrible husband killer of \\"The Corner House\\"; or the female, yetilike creature of \\"The Horror Horn\\"; or the sadistic Sybil Rorke of \\"Inscrutable Decrees\\"; or Bertha Acres of \\"The Outcast,\\" a woman so vile that the very earth spits out her coffin. Then there are the dueling witches of \\"The Wishing-Well\\" and the vampire witch of \\"The Room in the Tower.\\" Yes, Mr. Benson surely didn't have too much use for the ladies. However, in the bulk of these stories, the main characters are single, unattached, scholarly, middle-aged men--like Benson himself--who go on long summer holidays to Cornwall, Norfolk or Sussex, rent homes and get involved with all sorts of ghostly mishegas. (Modern-day readers will no doubt feel twinges of envy at the extended summer vacations that all these characters seem able to take!) Of course, space doesn't permit me to rave about each of the wonderful 54 tales in this volume, but I would like to single out for special mention a few of my favorites. \\"Pirates,\\" for example, is an incredibly beautifully written tale of a man who is haunted by the spirits of his youth when he revisits his old home. \\"Mr. Tilly's Seance\\" is a very unique story, in that it is a seance tale told from the point of view of the spirit. I've never read another one like it. \\"The Man Who Went Too Far\\" tells of a man who gets just a wee bit too close to Mother Nature; fans of Algernon Blackwood should especially like this one. \\"And the Dead Spake--\\" deals with a scientist who invents a device that enables him to play the brain cells of a corpse like a phonograph! It's a story that H. G. Wells himself might have written. And then there's \\"How Fear Departed From the Long Gallery,\\" Benson's favorite tale of the bunch, and one of mine, too. In this one, a house is haunted by the spirits of three-year-old twins; just to see these ghostly children spells sickness and death for the viewer. It is a lovely story, actually, well told and suspenseful. But then again, all the tales herein are well told and suspenseful, and elegantly written. Benson certainly deserves his place in that pantheon of great English supernaturalists that includes M.R. James, Sheridan LeFanu, Oliver Onions and Algernon Blackwood. Read this book, and you'll see that he was indeed one of the greats.	2003-01-02
US	49963565	R2UPQCDC6ZUJYE	0312957955	721205438	Falling Angel (Dead Letter Mystery)	Books	5	5	7	N	N	AN EXCELLENT THRILLER THAT WORKS ON MANY LEVELS	At one point in William Hjortsberg's masterful horror novel, Epiphany Proudfoot, 17-year-old voodoo priestess, tells our detective hero Harry Angel &quot;you sure know a lot about the city.&quot; The city in question is the New York of 1959, and if Angel knows a lot about this crazy burg, then Hjortsberg, in the course of this tale, demonstrates that he knows even more. While much has been said of this book's scary elements--its voodoo ceremonies and Black Mass meeting and horrible murders--what impressed me most about this tale is the incredible attention to realistic detail that the author invests it with. I don't know if the author grew up in this town in the '50s or just did a remarkable research job, but the reader really does get the impression that this book (which came out in 1978) was written a few decades earlier. Roosevelt Island is called Welfare Island, quite correctly; street names are given the names they had 45 years ago; subway ads are described that I can dimly recall from my youth at the time; one-cent peanut-vending machines are in the subways (boy, does that bring me back!); and on and on. This is the type of book in which if something is described, you can bet your bottom buck that it really existed. For example, at one point our hero walks into a 42nd St. theatre called Hubert's Museum and Flea Circus. I checked it out; it was really there in the late '50s! You can really learn a lot about the city as it was by reading this fast-moving tale; it's almost like a history lesson wrapped up in a hardboiled voodoo thriller.<BR>    And what a thriller this is! Even without the incredible attention to detail, this book would be a winner. In it, Harry Angel is hired by Lou Cyphre (get it?) to track down '40s crooner Johnny Favorite, and by the time Angel is through with his quest, we have been treated to all sorts of oddball NYC characters and grisly doings. Many scenes impress, most notably the late-night Central Park voodoo ceremony, the Black Mass in the abandoned subway station, and an off-season walk through the Coney Island midway. The book is justifiably included in Jones' and Newman's excellent overview volume, &quot;Horror: The Hundred Best Books.&quot; It works on many levels--as a thriller, as a scarifier, as a Faustian object lesson--and succeeds on all of them. I haven't seen the &quot;Angel Heart&quot; movie that was made from this wonderful book, but can't imagine it being any better. This volume deserves all the praise that's been heaped on it. Fortunately, it's still in print, as it well should be. I highly recommend it.	2002-11-11

Onions was supposedly a meticulous writer, writing and rewriting and rerewriting, changing words repeatedly until he felt that things were just right. And his attention to detail does indeed show. All the stories in this volume are impeccably written, with wonderful attention to detail, sensuous mood, and finely modulated suspense. None of the tales in this book are what I would call especially scary, especially by modern standards of violence and shock and grue, but all are fascinating and eminently readable. The main feature of all eight creepy little tales in this collection is that the supernatural element in each of them can be otherwise explained; that is, the ghosts or other strange happenings that we read of can be seen as being merely mental aberrations of the protaganist.<BR>    The collection starts off with a bang with \\"The Beckoning Fair One,\\" one of the most oft-anthologized horror tales. This ghost story has been called one of the best in the English language by such luminaries as Algernon Blackwood and H. P. Lovecraft, and who am I to argue with them? The tale is certainly the best in the \\"Widdershins\\" collection, and concerns an author who moves into a deserted house and starts to become influenced by its ghostly female occupant? Or...is it just in his mind? In \\"Phantas,\\" one of the survivors of an 18th century sinking galleon sees a vision of a 20th century ship as his own boat slips beneath the waves. Or...does he really? \\"Rooum\\" is the tale of an old engineer who complains of a phantom that constantly races up behind him and then THROUGH him, taking a bit more of himself with each passage. Is this really happening...or is the old guy just going barmy? In \\"Benlian,\\" a sculptor decides to really put ALL OF HIMSELFinto his last great project...soul and all. Does he really, or is the old bloke just slightly off his chump? \\"The Accident\\" involves no ghosts at all; just two men, enemies from their youth, who meet in a restaurant for dinner 40 years later. It's a tale of cosmic fate and what might have been. In \\"The Lost Thyrsus,\\" we're back to the spooky region, and a convalescent woman who, after reading Keats' \\"Endymion,\\" is visited by a horde of Grecian bacchanals. Does she really...or is it all in her sick mind? \\"Hic Jacet,\\" a longish tale, tells of a hack writer who attempts to pen the biography of his recently deceased artist friend, and the major problems he has with this task. Is the deceased artist really haunting him...or is it, again, all in his mind? Finally, in \\"The Cigarette Case,\\" two Englishmen on a walking tour in Provence encounter two strange women. Or do they really? When reading \\"Widdershins,\\" the reader must answer all these questions for him/herself. I prefer to tend toward the more ghostly explanations myself, but that's just me.<BR>    I should perhaps warn potential readers of this volume that \\"Widdershins\\" is NOT an easy read. I can't imagine anyone of average intelligence going into this book without the aid of an UNabridged dictionary, an atlas, an encyclopedia and the use of the Internet as research tools. There are lots of 100-year-old British slang words and expressions, and even I--a copy editor with what I feel to be an above-average vocabulary--was thrown many times. Still, for those willing to take the time and effort to read this book with the care and attention it deserves--the same care and attention, I might add, that Oliver Onions obviously invested in his writing of this volume--\\"Widdershins\\" will repay their efforts.	2002-10-28
US	49963565	RYLP14YKU8CX9	0881840386	379683468	The Citadel of Fear	Books	5	12	12	N	N	A WILD RIDE	The name of Francis Stevens may be little known today, but from 1916-1920, she was very well known to the readers of such magazines as &quot;The Argosy&quot; and &quot;All-Story Weekly,&quot; and had fans that included H.P. Lovecraft and A. Merritt. In the introduction to the 1970 Paperback Library edition, Sam Moscowitz refers to her as &quot;the most gifted woman writer of science fiction and science-fantasy between Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and C.L. Moore.&quot; Pretty high praise indeed, but having read what is considered to be Stevens' masterpiece, &quot;The Citadel of Fear,&quot; one will be tempted to agree with this assessment. This novel originally appeared in &quot;The Argosy&quot; between September and October of 1918, and is as exciting and fascinating a read as any  modern-day reader could hope for. <BR>    It tells the tale of an Irishman and an American who come upon the lost Aztec city of Tlapallan, in the wilds of Mexico. After witnessing many fantastic sights there, the Irishman is kicked out for inadvertently stirring up a civil war, and the American is held prisoner. Flash forward 15 years. At the home of the Irishman's sister, a rampaging monster trashes the house one night, and that is only the beginning of one incredibly wild ride. I don't want to give too much away here, and spoil the book's many breathtaking surprises, but let me just say that by the novel's incredibly hallucinatory conclusion, we have been treated to a whole slew of nightmare creatures, battling Aztec gods, indoor swamps and on and on. Ms. Stevens sure did have one active imagination, AND the technical prowess to make her wildest  plot devices come alive and seem plausible. The book is beautifully written, despite an occasional dangling modifier here and there, and there is no way that any reader will be able to guess what lies next in this amazing tale. What a shame that this package of wonders has been out of print for the last 30 years or so, in addition to all of Ms.Stevens' other work. Having read &quot;Citadel,&quot; I would love to read some of Francis Stevens' other tales. So will you.	2002-10-07
US	49963565	R1MAJ832KF1CU9	0345286022	437966003	Edge of Running Water	Books	5	23	23	N	N	A BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN, LITERATE HORROR MASTERPIECE	William Sloane wrote only two novels, but they were both doozies. The first, \\"To Walk the Night\\" (1937), is a combination sci-fi/horror/fantasy/mystery tale concerning a mysterious, otherworldly woman. Two years later, Mr. Sloane came out with \\"The Edge of Running Water,\\" and this one, I feel, is even better. It concerns an electrophysicist, Dr. Julian Blair, who is attempting to construct an apparatus that will enable him to communicate with his dead wife. The book takes place on a promontory on the Kennebec River in a lonely part of Maine (hence, I suppose, the title). Like the first book, this one is beautifully written, with a few sharply drawn characters, great pacing and suspense, and a tremendous windup. Given the fantastic nature of the central premise, it may come as a surprise how realistic and believable the presentation is. The story is told by Richard Sayles, an ex-student of Dr. Blair's, who has come to visit the professor and assist him in his work. The gradually unfolding horror is seen through his eyes, and he makes for a very creditable eyewitness of the amazing events. <BR>    I really can't say enough about this terrific novel. It seems to have everything: an intriguing murder mystery; a great and well-described setting; appealing and interesting characters; suspenseful action; and a unique premise. In the book's terrific conclusion, all the characters get exactly what they deserve. It is an extremely satisfying denouement. Sloane, as I mentioned, writes wonderfully. What a pity that he only produced these two great books. There are so many passages that one will want to read over. For example, this one, in which Dr. Sayles reflects on his love for Blair's deceased wife: \\"A love that is true to living persons and existing realities is steadfast and fine. But I saw then, for the first time, that a love which has fastened upon the dead and true to nothing but a past that was finished, is not a good nor true emotion. If it went on too long, it couldbecome an incubus, throttling a man from the real life of the present, which is the life that we were fashioned to meet and experience.\\"  This book, despite the horror theme and eerie developments, is nonetheless a quite literate experience. It was, incidentally,  made into a Boris Karloff movie in 1941 called \\"The Devil Commands.\\" I have not seen the film, but, despite its good reputation, I don't see how it could hope to compare to this fine novel. I would advise all Amazon.com readers to seek it out as a unique experience.	2002-09-18

If it weren't for James Cawthorn and Michael Moorcock's indispensable overview volume entitled \\"Fantasy: The 100 Best Books,\\" I probably would never have heard of \\"To Walk the Night\\" (1937), and would thus have been deprived of a wonderful read. Having read it, though, it seems to me that this, William Sloane's first novel, could just as easily have gone on someone's Top 100 Horror, Mystery OR Sci-Fi list, as this terrific book has elements of all those categories mixed in. <BR>    The tale concerns two young men who visit their alma mater and discover one of their old professors murdered...burnt to a crisp by some mysterious flame. One of the two ex-students falls in love with the dead professor's widow, a very mysterious woman with cold and emotionless qualities. They eventually marry, and this is the point where the book really takes off. The reader will never guess the background of the lady in question, or why she evinces such unusual mental powers, and why she seems to be an outsider everywhere she goes. This is certainly NOT your traditional murder mystery! The novel is beautifully written by Mr. Sloane; it's hard to believe that this is his first book. It's an extremely suspenseful page-turner that does not disappoint. Once the reader finishes this book, he/she will doubtless feel compelled to seek out William Sloane's only other book, \\"The Edge of Running Water,\\" which, sadly enough, like \\"To Walk the Night,\\" is also inexplicably out of print. Anyway, my thanks to Cawthorn and Moorcock for turning me on to a really excellent book. I advise others to seek it out.	2002-09-04
US	49963565	R17VJI4SID7LIT	0879100907	406944080	Jean Arthur: The Actress Nobody Knew	Books	5	126	139	N	N	TO JOHN OLLER WE GIVE THANKS	I had waited impatiently for almost 30 years for someone to tackle a biography of Jean Arthur, one of my favorite actresses and one of the brightest comediennes of the '30s and '40s. In my youthful naivete, seeing that nobody seemed interested in the project, I thought about taking on the job myself. Thank goodness I waited for John Oller to write his book instead! There's no way that anyone could have done a better job with this most reclusive and challenging of subjects. Even during her heyday, Ms. Arthur was an extremely private person--\\"America's Garbo,\\" as she was called--and in the final decades of her life, snubbed all efforts from outsiders seeking autographs or interviews about her glorious past. It may seem faint praise to call Mr. Oller's book a definitive biography when it is the ONLY one to have ever been written, but I just don't see how anyone will ever gain more access to Jean Arthur information than he has presented here. Oller has taken the time to interview dozens of Arthur's friends and family members, as well as associates from her film and stage careers and from her various teaching posts. The book is remarkably evenhanded. Arthur was apparently a very complex person, with lots of insecurities and neuroses that made her somewhat of a problem to work with. (I'm trying to be kind here.) Oller clearly thinks the world of the actress, but at the same time doesn't shrink from telling us when a producer or neighbor had something rotten to say of her. And when Oller runs into an area where the evidence leads to no clear result (such as the case of Arthur's possible bisexuality), he gives us the facts as well as can be known and leaves it at that. The book is anything but sensationalistic.<BR>    This biography traces Arthur's roots all the way back to the 13th century (!) but at the same time does not get bogged down in needless verbiage. It moves swiftly along; indeed, I almost found myself wishing that Oller would devote more space to some of my favorite Arthur movies. One would think that the most interesting segment of this actress' story would be the great Hollywood years, but as it turned out, the latter portion of the book, dealing with Arthur's life after Hollywood, was even more interesting. Oller takes us on a trip through Arthur's stage career, her life as a student and teacher, and her reclusive final years in Carmel, CA. It's all fascinating material, especially for fans of the actress who were never privy to any of this stuff before. The author writes well; it's hard to believe that this biography is his first book. By reading closely and looking at the notes at the rear of this work, one deduces that Mr. Oller spent the better part of a decade on this project...and the results have paid off extremely well.<BR>    That said, I should also note that there ARE some small problems with the book; some minor mistakes that a close reading reveals. For example, there are some errors as regards dates. Oller writes that Arthur's play \\"The Freaking Out of Stephanie Blake\\" had a preview on Wednesday, 11/2/67. However, in reality, that date was a Thursday. He writes that Arthur's brother Robert was born in March 1892 and died in November 1955 at age 61. Shouldn't that be 63? He writes that at the time of Arthur's death in 1991, she hadn't appeared in a film \\"in more than forty  years.\\" But if \\"Shane\\" came out in 1953, wouldn't that be \\"a mere\\" 38 years? Mr. Oller tells us that Dee Hoty--the actress who took over briefly for Ms. Arthur in \\"First Monday in October\\"-- was \\"barely twenty\\" that year (1975), although the Internet Broadway Database gives her birth date as 8/16/52, making her over 23 at the time. He writes of an Oscar ceremony in February 1935 as being in the \\"spring\\"; shouldn't that be \\"winter\\"? He tells us that the movie \\"The Stripper,\\" in which Arthur was reportedly going to make a comeback, was based on the William Inge play \\"Celebration.\\" I have always thought the play in question to be called \\"ALoss of Roses.\\" Does it go by another name? To end this nitpicking, Mr. Oller tells us that \\"Shane\\" was the \\"third highest-grossing film of 1953.\\" But as reported in the book \\"Box Office Hits,\\" \\"Shane\\" came in fourth at $9 million, behind \\"Peter Pan\\" ($24 million), \\"The Robe\\" ($17.5 million) and \\"From Here To Eternity\\" ($12.2 million).<BR>    I feel that these oversights need to be pointed out, as they tend to undermine an otherwise meticulously researched volume, but at the same time feel a bit churlish for seeming ungrateful for Mr. Oller's hard work. The fact of the matter is that he has done the world, and fans of Ms. Arthur in particular and old-timey movies in general, a terrific service, and I am very grateful to him. I have read his book twice already, and will continue to refer to it for many years.	2002-08-26
US	49963565	RVRGQTVDO8EE3	0441781942	43650023	Star Hunter/Voodoo Planet	Books	2	3	6	N	N	TWO NORTON TALES...BOTH UNSATISFYING	This book collects two of Andre Norton's novellas in one package.  Both have to do with planets where safaris are conducted for the pleasure of wealthy offworlders, and both leave the reader wanting more in terms of either explanation or detail. <BR>    The first, \\"Star Hunter\\" (1961), is the better of the two. In this one, the safari leader on the planet Jumala has cooked up a scheme whereby he can exact revenge on the space syndicate that has done him dirty. His scheme involves planting a young man on the planet with a set of conditioned memories, and passing the young man off as a lost heir. The scheme goes awry when unsuspected native life on the planet rises up and starts setting traps for the safari men. The story certainly moves quickly, and there is no dearth of action and monsters and color. But in the end, there is also no explanation for any of the mysteries we have witnessed--only a vague hinting at best--and this reader was left extremely disappointed. Rather than being left with that \\"wonder of space\\" and the mystery-of-the-cosmos feeling that Norton might have been trying to convey, all that most readers will be left with, I feel, is a sense of being gypped.<BR>    \\"Voodoo Planet\\" (1959), at 62 pages, might not even be considered a novella; more like a long short story. This tale constitutes the third installment of the Dane Thorson/Solar Queen series, and is a rather weak entry in this otherwise terrific bunch of books. Here, Dane, Captain Jellico, and Medic Tau are stranded on Khatka, a planet that had been settled many years ago by Africans after the Second Atomic War. Our boys fight off many alien creatures in the wilds of Khatka--the fight with the rock apes is a highlight of the story--and help conquer the evil witch doctor who is trying to overthrow the legitimate government. Magic is thrown about left and right with only a superficial, mumbo-jumbo explanation of how things are done; something about ancestral memories. When all is said and done, the reader has enjoyed the sequences with the alien monsters but is left shaking his/her head at the implausibility of the magical elements. What might have worked in a tale of the \\"Witch World\\" somehow doesn't fly in this tale of hard sci-fi survival. <BR>    And let's not even go into how Norton makes up words such as \\"discordinate,\\" constantly uses the word \\"turgid\\" instead of \\"turbid\\" (as in \\"the water was turgid\\"), and constantly uses expressions such as [the other figure was] \\"still very still.\\" Her early works certainly did lack polish, but even here, in some of her lesser early work, the Norton flair for telling an exciting tale with color and drive comes through.	2002-08-08

This time around, Thorson and his 11 shipmates on the galactic trader Solar Queen... <BR>    It's a very fast-moving and suspenseful tale, full of unusual detail and unexpected turns. There are several highlights that make the book really shine, such as the gorp hunt early in the story. (And when I say \\"gorp,\\" I'm not talking about high-energy nut-and-raisin trail mix, but rather reptilian, crablike monsters!) This gorp hunt takes place at sunset on the reefs of an oily sea, and is a highly atmospheric and exciting segment. Other great sections include a raid on an asteroid's emergency station; a landing in the Big Burn...  and the viewing of the mutant life-forms therein; and the battle... near the book's end, where our heroes make a desperate bid to make their plea for justice to the citizens of the solar system. Like I said, this is a slam-bang sequel, that will leave few readers unsatisfied.<BR>    That having been said, I need to also mention that there are a few inconsistencies in the book. At one point, Norton tells us that Dane has been in the trading service for a few months; somewhere else, she says that it has been a full year. Huh? And I feel that I must chastise Ace Books for the deplorable job with which this book has been put together. Now don't get me wrong: I LOVE these little Ace paperbacks from the 1950s, especially those 2-in-1 Ace doubles. But there are so many typos--not to mention punctuational and grammatical errors--in this book that the reading thereof is made a labor. Should we blame Norton or thepublishers for a sentence such as this: \\"His hands, blundering within the metallic claws of the gloves, Dane buckled two safety belts about him.\\" How could any copy editor or proofreader let such an egregious line such as this get through, when just the simple deletion of that first comma would have made all the difference?! Apparently, these little Ace books were never proofed or edited. They're wonderful volumes, with marvelously pulpy covers, but sadly, the contents were not given their due.      But enough about Ace's carelessness. \\"Plague Ship,\\" despite the occasional blunder, is still a marvelous entertainment, and I do highly recommend it.	2002-07-19
US	49963565	RKCYYQCA4JJYL	0441749860	607616178	Sargasso of Space	Books	4	3	3	N	N	OLD-FASHIONED SCI-FI FUN	&quot;Sargasso of Space&quot; is the opening novel in Andre Norton's so-called &quot;Dane Thorson series,&quot; and is a fine introduction to the books that follow. In this first volume we meet Dane Thorson, a young cargo-apprentice who is assigned (by mechanical Psycho selection) to the trader ship Solar Queen. The crew of the Queen pools its earnings and wins an entire planet, sight unseen, at auction. (Perhaps Ebay will be conducting auctions such as this in 50 or so years!) The crew then explores this strange planet, called Limbo, and discovers the remnants of a lost civilization, as well as globular natives, space pirates, mysterious artifacts and so on. <BR>    Ostensibly written for juveniles and &quot;young adults,&quot; this novel has a strong appeal for &quot;grown-ups&quot; as well. Not for nothing has Ms. Norton become one of the most popular of all sci-fi/fantasy writers, selling kajillions of books and endearing herself to the hearts of millions. She writes simply but directly, and her characters are always sharply drawn and easy to identify with. Her early sci-fi works (this one was written in 1955) are in the true Golden Age pulp spirit, with no symbolism or literary tricks to gussy up the pleasure of an exciting story well told. By the end of this short but exciting novel, we feel that we know a lot about the 12 crewmembers of the Solar Queen, yet want to know more. In that, the book is an unqualified success.<BR>    As a matter of fact, I only had one small problem with this Norton novel. At one point in the story, our trader heroes set out to explore some alien ruins located around 20 miles from their ship. They walk to the ruins in a heavy fog, look around, and then decide to walk back! Now, I don't care how tough these guys are (and truth to tell, they seem more like average Joes than Stallone-type action figures, to the author's credit)...nobody walks 40 miles in a day--not even the Marines--on a gravity-normal planet! But beyond this stretching of credulity, &quot;Sargasso of Space&quot; is a marvelous entertainment that I do recommend highly to all lovers of old-fashioned sci-fi fun.	2002-07-09

Rider Haggard wrote that deals with the life of Allan Quatermain, an English hunter in South Africa. This is a stand-alone novel. Unlike the first two novels in the series, \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" and its sequel, \\"Allan Quatermain\\"; the so-called Zulu trilogy (\\"Marie,\\" \\"Child of Storm\\" and \\"Finished\\"); and the loosely linked series of books that I call the Taduki quartet (\\"Allan and the Holy Flower,\\" \\"The Ivory Child,\\" \\"The Ancient Allan\\" and \\"Allan and the Ice Gods\\"), \\"Heu-Heu\\" can be read all by itself, and without any previous knowledge of the Quatermain universe. Yes, references are made to previous adventures and characters, but they are passing references at best, explained as they are brought up, and would in no way unduly confuse a reader new to the Quatermain cycle.<br />  This time around, Allan and his sidekick, the faithful and always amusing Hottentot Hans, go on a mission for the Zulu wizard Zikali (himself featured in many of the previous Quatermain books) and endeavor to bring back some leaves from the rare Tree of Illusions. They also attempt to delve into the mystery of Heu-Heu, a monstrous, 12-foot-tall, clawed and red-bearded semigorilla god who may or may not exist. As is usual with Haggard, the novel starts off with a great action set piece (the mother of all storms, in which our heroes are forced to seek shelter in a creepy Bushman cave), and from there moves swiftly and excitingly. Haggard was a master storyteller, even in his twilight years (this book was written in 1923, two years before his death), and this novel gives fans all the goods that they've come to expect from him. Before all is said and done, we have been treated to an exciting desert crossing (not as harrowing as the one depicted in \\"King Solomon's Mines,\\" perhaps, but still fun...for the reader, that is), a petrified ancient civilization, a monster flood, a volcanic eruption, and a canoe chase on a raging river. Haggard was also the master (if not the originator) of the \\"lost civilization\\" tale, and in \\"Heu-Heu\\" we are treated to two such: the Walloos,  a people on the decline who worship the giant ape god, and the Hairy Ones, who are more ape than man and may even constitute the fabled Missing Link. Typically, the Hottentot Hans provides most of the comedic relief, and saves the day on more than one occasion. Allan Quatermain, no slouch himself in the action department, admits in this book that he would long since have expired without the resourcefulness of this amusing little character. The two combined make for one of the best action duos in the history of adventure-fantasy literature. All in all, \\"Heu-Heu,\\" while perhaps not on a par with some of the other Quatermains mentioned above, is still an exciting tale that should provide most red-blooded readers with a few nights of thrills and laughs. Like ALL the other books in the Quatermain cycle, I heartily recommend it.	2002-06-27
US	49963565	R34DA5T35VVQJF	0749005203	670796651	The Fu Manchu Omnibus: Volume 5	Books	3	10	11	N	N	FINAL AND FUN FOOTNOTES OF FU	\\"The Wrath of Fu Manchu\\" is the 14th and final book in Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu series. I refer here to the original DAW publication of 1976, which included four short stories dealing with the good doctor, as well as some other Sax Rohmer stories not related to the series but interesting in their own right. The four Fu stories serve as mere footnotes or codas to the previous 13 novels, but all are interesting, and a must for Fu completists. <BR>    Before going on, I would like to say a thing or two about the final Fu Manchu NOVEL, \\"Emperor Fu Manchu,\\" as there is nowhere else on Amazon to do so. This 13th and final Fu novel is unique in that it is the only one in the series that actually takes place in China. In this one, Nayland Smith and American agent Tony McKay try to rescue an entomologist from Fu's lair; stop the kidnapping of a German physicist; AND destroy a Russian germ warfare research station in the jungles of the Chinese wilderness. The book is kind of a half and half affair, as in the first part of the novel, all Smith and McKay seem to do is traipse back and forth around Szechuan province, from one rendezvous to another. But then the book really gets going, as our heroes penetrate Fu's lair and are shown the secret of the doctor's \\"Cold Men\\": the zombie army that Fu Manchu has resurrected from the dead. The finale of the book is actually quite suspenseful. However, the book does contain the usual Rohmeresque errors. For example, Fu's referring to the rat torture of book 2 (\\"The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu\\") as \\"the Seven  Gates of Wisdom\\" instead of \\"the Six Gates of Wisdom\\"; Fu's comment that the goal of the Si-Fan is to overthrow Communism, when in previous books it was to overthrow the West in general and restore China to its former glory; the use of a peach tree as a landmark in one section of the book later turning into a pear tree(!); the ability of a character to discern another's eye color and skin color in a dark room; and so on. And howzabout thisfor a sentence: \\"...presently, she said, 'Were you angry with me for being such a liar?' she asked.\\" Things like this can drive a reader to distraction. Sax Rohmer was a terrific writer of thrillers but, like most writers, his work needed copyediting, and I don't think it ever received such attention. His descriptions of geography throughout the entire series are problematic at best. In this book, for example, we are asked to picture a river that becomes a creek, joining up with a streamlike brook that becomes a miniature bay. Whew! Anyway, quibbles aside, this is a fun ending for the 13 Fu Manchu novels, a series that I highly recommend being read in consecutive order for maximum impact.<BR>    But to return to the final BOOK, \\"The Wrath of Fu Manchu\\": The first two stories in the book, \\"The Wrath of Fu Manchu\\" and \\"The Eyes of Fu Manchu,\\" fill in the gaps between the last novels of the series. \\"Wrath\\" is certainly the best of the bunch, and features the final appearance of Fah Lo Suee, Fu's daughter. In this one, Fu threatens to contaminate the gold supply of Fort Knox (years before Auric Goldfinger hatched a similar scheme!), and Nayland Smith infiltrates a meeting of the Council of Seven to stop him. It is a pretty suspenseful tale. The high point of \\"Eyes\\" is a cameo appearance by Dr. Petrie, the narrator of the earliest Fu novels. In this story, Fu kidnaps a scientist and tries to make him work on Fu's life-prolongation experiments. It is a short but satisfying tale. The remaining two Fu stories in the book are \\"The Word of Fu Manchu,\\" in which freelance journalist Malcolm Forbes (!!!) accompanies Smith as he tries to find out how a CID agent has been killed, and \\"The Mind of Fu Manchu,\\" in which the good doctor steals the plans for a flying saucer. These last two stories are short shorts and are over very quickly; sadly, they are anticlimaxes to a wonderful series of books.<BR>     The other, non-Fu stories in the collection are a mixed bag, some in the supernatural vein, many tales of Egyptian adventure. In \\"Nightmare House,\\" a curse from the Middle Ages afflicts a lonely  estate in Cornwall. \\"The Leopard-Couch\\" tells of an ancient Egyptian curio that houses the spirit of a dead priestess. \\"The Mystery of the Fabulous Lamp\\" is a sweet little O. Henryish story of a couple that buys a lamp that changes that couple's life. \\"A Date at Shepheard's\\" treats of modern-day (i.e., 1950) Egypt and how the harem customs have persisted. \\"The Mark of Maat\\" is also a tale of modern-day (1944) Egypt, and deals with the strange vengeance that that ancient deity seems to exact on a tomb raider. \\"The Treasure of Taia\\" is a beautifully written--almost poetically written--story of the plot against a struggling archeologist, again in 20th century Egypt. \\"Crime Takes a Cruise\\" is a delightful thriller set in Port Said, in which a young American girl and an Irish secret serviceman join forces to flush out a dealer in Nazi treasures. Finally, there is the supernatural tale \\"A House Possessed,\\" in which an English estate is cursed by a student of Nostradamus himself. This tale does elicit some nice shuddery moments. Many of the stories just mentioned are unsatisfying, in that mundane explanations are presented for events that the reader would probably prefer to remain unexplained or supernatural. As usual, Rohmeresque anachronisms and inconsistencies are present. For example, in \\"Nightmare House,\\" events are described that supposedly took place around the time of the second Plantagenet (the early 1200s). However, harquebusses (a type of musket) are being used, and they didn't come in until around the 1400s! These harquebusses are also said to shoot arrows. Did muskets shoot arrows back then? Somehow, I doubt it! In \\"A House Possessed,\\" the house is supposed to have been built before 1640, based on designs by English architect John Vanbrugh. But Vanbrugh wasn't born until 1664! Like I said, Rohmer was in critical need of a good copy editor, and, sadly, never seemed to get one. Still, the book has ample charms, and I do recommend it.	2002-06-18

This book, the 12th of 14 in the Fu Manchu series, is, like number 11 (\\"The Shadow of Fu Manchu\\"), a short, minor but nevertheless compact entry in the Fu saga. This time, the Fu man attempts to wrest control of his native China from the pesky Communists who have taken his country over. The book features one of the most complex plots of any Fu Manchu novel; indeed, it can be accused of being overplotted! But what makes this book so interesting, and sets it apart from all the other books in the series, is that we don't know until the very end whether or not Nayland Smith, our eternal Fu fighter from all the previous novels, is indeed Nayland Smith OR, as has been subtly hinted, a DOUBLE that Fu Manchu has concocted via plastic surgery. Brian Merrick, the young grad student who is enlisted by Smith to help him, is in a similar quandary, never knowing what the heck is going on, and the reader shares his puzzlement. Without knowing for sure whether Smith is indeed Smith, all stability is pulled out from under us, and all characters become suspect. The book is a true mystery that keeps you guessing, the action jumping from London to Cairo to the Big Apple. <BR> This time around, there are practically no internal inconsistencies or inconsistencies with previous volumes. Nevertheless, there are one or two goofs. At one point, FBI man Harkness tells Smith that he has 11 men on the case: 4 FBI and 9 police. Does something not add up here or is it just me? Also, the description of one of Fu Manchu's agents, Nadia Narovska, with amethyst eyes and auburn hair, sounds exactly like the character of Ardatha in several of the previous volumes. Perhaps Sax Rohmer just had a thing for red-headed women with violet eyes. In any case, this is yet another fun thriller in the Fu Manchu saga.	2002-05-21

This book, the 11th of 14 in the Fu Manchu series, is a short and minor entry in the Fu saga, but nonetheless a compact and suspenseful one. In many of the previous books, the Fu man sets his sights on a scientific genius and designs to either kidnap him, steal his invention or kill him in a macabre manner. This action is usually given a chapter or two and takes the form of an unusual episode in the larger scheme of the plot. This time around, the entire book is concerned with Fu's plans regarding Dr. Morris Craig's new energy weapon. While the weapon's ultimate use is never really spelled out, it seems to be some kind of disintegrator that can also be used as a potential source of limitless energy. This is the type of book that can be called a whodunnit,as well as a howdunnit and a whydunnit; all of the characters can be viewed as suspects. Even the characters that we  are pretty sure are \\"good guys\\" can be guilty of misdeeds, given the Fu man's powers of hypnosis and mind control. Thus, the reader is unsure till the very end of the book why people do what they do and act the way they act. Who is the British agent? Who is the Russian agent? Who is the secret FBI agent? You get the idea. The Fu man's main goal in this book seems to be to thwart the Communists from getting control of Dr. Craig's energy weapon; thus, he comes off a little more sympathetically than in some of the other entries in the series. The action this time takes place in the Big Apple and in a country estate in the Connecticut countryside. The estate scene is a very suspenseful sequence indeed. The book also features a memorable character named M'goyna, a Turkish zombie who is more gorilla than man. He is one  of Fu's more remarkable henchmen. Also featured is a Sevillian torture chair that lowers a skull-crushing canopy onto the occupant; one of the Dr.'s more grisly inducements.<BR>    The book contains fewer inconsistencies than others in the series. I did notice some things that bothered me,however. The author often refers to Fu Manchu speaking sibilantly, but often this will happen when the sentence Fu has just spoken contains no \\"s\\" or \\"sh\\" sounds at all! How can this be? Also, in one point of the book, Nayland Smith, our eternal Fu fighter, says that Fu's drug for paralyzing the speech muscles wears off with time. He says that Fu told this to him. However, we are never shown Fu saying this, and indeed, when Smith was thus paralyzed, he needed an antidote injection to counteract the effects of the drug! It also doesn't make sense that {WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD} Fu Manchu has already possessed the prototype of Craig's invention for many years. Why hasn't he taken over the world decades ago, with an invention such as this? But quibbles aside, I feel that any fan of fast-paced action, with a tinge of sci-fi and mystery thrown in, will enjoy this short but fun entry in the Fu series.	2002-05-13

This book, the 10th of 14 in the Fu Manchu series, is a direct continuation of the previous installment, \\"The Drums of Fu Manchu.\\" Hence, a reading of that previous volume is fairly essential before going into this one. In the present volume, Sir Dennis Nayland Smith continues his ongoing battle against the evil doctor, aided again by narrator Bart Kerrigan and by Europe's foremost archeologist, Sir Lionel Barton, who figured so prominently in books 1, 4 and 5 (\\"The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu,\\" \\"The Daughter of Fu Manchu\\" and \\"The Mask of Fu Manchu\\"). This book is the wartime entry in the Fu series, and takes place in blackout London; it then hops over the pond for action in the Big Apple, the Panama Canal Zone and in Haiti. This time around, the Fu man has completed his air and naval forces and has concentrated them in a base hidden in an extinct Haitian volcano. His goal seems to be to stymie America's naval forces from his Carribean base. This Fu novel is the most sci-fi-oriented in the series thus far, what with Ericksen disintegrators, the Vortland (invisibility) lamp, antigravity devices, futuristic planes and ships and so on. The volcano lair is reminiscent of Ayesha's home in the great great Haggard novel \\"She,\\" while the showdown at the end of this book, in that volcanic hideaway, would in turn seem to be the inspiration for Dahl's screenplay for the James Bond film \\"You Only Live Twice.\\" As in book 6, \\"The Bride of Fu Manchu,\\" the high point of this book occurs when Fu takes our narrator on a tour of his laboratory grounds, showing off his assorted experiments and biological creations. The book also boasts one of the most suspenseful sequences in the entire Fu series thus far, that in which Smith and Kerrigan infiltrate a voodoo ceremony high atop a Haitian mountain. This sequence is genuinely creepy and exciting. The book also offers Snapping Finger deaths, a treasure map, a mysterious floating green hand, zombies AND a featured role by Peko, Fu's pet marmoset from previous volumes. The reader is always kept engaged by the fast-moving shenanigans, par for the course for a Fu Manchu novel.<br />  I did have some quibbles with this installment, however; these quibbles mainly take the form of internal inconsistencies and inconsistencies with previous books in the series. For example, at one point, Smith refers to his adventure in Khorassan with Lionel Barton. However, in book 5 it is clearly stated that Smith teamed up with Barton in Isfahan, Iran AFTER Barton returned from Khorassan! In another section of this book, Kerrigan refers to his second meeting with Ardatha (in book 9) by a river in Norfolk. However, it was on the Essex marshes that this meeting took place. Kerrigan elsewhere thinks to himself how a street in Panama reminds him of Clovelly in Cornwall; however, a look at a map will show that Clovelly is really in nearby Devonshire. Shall I go on? At one point in the book, Kerrigan is locked in Fu's warehouse and is looking DOWN at the Thames far below. Later on, it is said that he was locked BELOW the warehouse, under water level. HUH!?!? In the Panama scenes, Flammario the dancer is described as wearing a sable cloak. This, after the author speaks of how hot the tropical night was. Does this make sense? Howzabout this: In London, Smith & Co. follow up a clue at 39B Pelling St. A few days later, in New York City, they follow up some clues at 39B Sutton Place! Is this just a crazy kozmik coincidence in the wild wild world of Fu Manchu, or just lazy forgetfulness on the part of the author? Who knows? I might also go on to add that the antigravitic substance in this novel, swainsten, is a bit too similar to the Cavorite in H.G. Wells' wonderful \\"First Men in the Moon\\" novel, or that the resolution of the Snapping Fingers deaths doesn't really hang together logically, or that the ending of this book comes too suddenly, but I think you get the idea. The book is certainly flawed. But you know what? Even with all that,Rohmer carries it off, due to his great imagination, wonderful characters and rat-a-tat-tat pacing. The man could have used a better editor, but as far as telling a thriller of a tale goes, the man was tops. And this is yet another fine entry in the Fu Manchu series.Rohmer carries it off, due to his great imagination, wonderful characters and rat-a-tat-tat pacing.

Actually, it isn't so much genuine world peace that the good doctor is interested in, but rather a state that is more conducive to the eventual takeover by his Si-Fan organization. While the book does seem to make the case that Nazi and Fascist dictators are preferable to the \\"yellow menace\\" as represented by the Manchu man, it still shows those men to be overbearing, arrogant and ripe for being brought down. The book is certainly racist (to a degree, all the other entries in the series are, too), as the reviewers below mention, but at the same time it does make a plea for peace and sanity in the year before WW2 broke out...and that's not too bad a message for any novel.<BR>    In this book we have a new narrator, the journalist Bart Kerrigan, who joins Nayland Smith on his seemingly endless quest to foil the Doctor's plans. The action hops around quite a bit in this installment, from Essex and Suffolk to London, from Venice back to London, and finally off to (not so) gay Paree. The action is fairly relentless, the book's real saving grace. What with Green Deaths, a run-in with the Doctor on the Essex marshes, brainwashing via television, a new kind of superrifle, the Ericksen disintegration tube, torture chambers under creepy Venetian palazzos, a yacht trap on the Adriatic, killer pygmies and on and on, this book really keeps the reader glued to the page. One of our old friends from previous volumes makes a return in this book, and it's a real stunner when this character does reappear. So despite the racist elements, the book entertains.<BR>    I did, however, have more serious problems with the book than just the racial comments. There are numerous inconsistencies with previous entries that just bug the bejeebers out of me. For example, in one scene of this volume, Fu Manchu refers to \\"the Seven Gates,\\" a grisly rat torture used on Nayland Smith in book 2, \\"The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu.\\" But in that earlier volume, it was called \\"the Six Gates.\\" Grrrrr. In the current book, Smith is referred to as a \\"deep, silent sleeper,\\" while in the previous book, #8 (\\"President Fu Manchu\\"), he is referred to as a light, \\"hair trigger\\" sleeper. Huh?!?!? Fey, Smith's manservant, in previous volumes, has had a rather normal pattern of speech. In this volume, his speech is telegraphic and robotlike all of a sudden. What!?!?!? These kinds of inconsistencies can and do drive alert readers bonkers. But the worst thing of all in this book is when Smith tells someone that a description of a Japanese suspect is not necessary, as all descriptions of his \\"countrymen sound identical.\\" Jeeeeezzzzz!!!!! Get past these groaners, though, and you'll have a fun time. I did.	2002-04-17

This book marks yet another departure in the Fu Manchu series: It is the longest of the books, the most detailed, possibly the best written, takes place in the U.S. for the first time, and is the most political book in the series thus far. In this one, the Fu-man, through \\"the League of Good Americans,\\" backs a presidential candidate who will, in time, become his puppet dictator.  Our old friend Sir Nayland Smith is back, trying to stop this conquest; he is aided by Federal agent Mark Hepburn. For the first time in the series, Dr. Petrie does not make even a token appearance. This book features the typical fast pacing and grotesque action that have become familiar at this point in the series. We encounter numerous killings with poisonous spiders, a raid on a NYC Chinatown catacomb lair... a \\"Manchurian Candidate\\"-style assassination of a presidential hopeful (almost 30 years before that classic movie), a boat chase down the Niagara rapids, and much more. As I said, there is a great wealth of detail and incident in this installment. Fu, at one point, even takes time out of his busy agenda to operate on adying, diphtheritic boy; just Sax Rohmer's way of showing us that there is some good in the old doctor, after all.<BR>    I did have some minor problems with this Fu installment, however, good as it is. There really is no reason for there to be two characters named Wu Chang; this just leads to confusion for the reader! Also, at one point in the book, Fu Manchu tries to brainwash Hepburn from a hotel window one floor below where Hepburn's room is. A few pages later, it is said that Fu was TWO floors below! Also, the description of Wu King's underground Chinatown lair was, for me anyway, a bit hard to follow. But all in all, this is a mighty fun and involving book. And I just love the line thatFu Manchu delivers to Nayland Smith, right before attempting to blow him up with that bomb on top of the skyscraper (remember that this line comes after eight books' worth of chases and incredible adventure): \\"Our association, if at times tedious, has never been dishonorable.\\"	2002-04-08

This book is something of a radical departure from the previous six in that there is no first-person narrator, but at the same time hearkens back to the tone of the first three volumes in the series, in that the action takes place in the Surrey and Limehouse regions of London. Nayland Smith, Dr. Petrie and Alan Sterling are all back, as are Fleurette and Fah Lo Suee. This book introduces the character of Inspector Gallaho from Scotland Yard, as cool and tough an ally as any bunch of Fu fighters could hope for. The story this time concerns Fu Manchu's kidnapping of Fleurette Petrie away from her father. There is also a wonderful side plot in which it is discovered that Fu has been making his own gold, alchemist style, in an abandoned tunnel under the Thames River. The raiding of this factory takes up fully 1/4 of the book, and is a very well done and suspenseful set piece. Multiple narrative strands converge here in bravura manner; a first-person narrative could not have allowed for these wonderful scenes. One of the long-standing characters in the series meets an end here, and it is a shocking moment when it comes. There are, however, several instances of inconsistency and fuzziness in the book that prevent me from giving it a top grade. For instance, in one scene Smith and Co. visit the doctor who bought Petrie's practice many years before. His name is Dr. Norton. However, in book #3, &quot;The Hand of Fu Manchu,&quot; we were told that this man's name was Dr. Murray! Inconsistencies like this can drive an alert reader crazy! There is also no reason why there had to be two completely unrelated characters named Preston in the current novel; itonly leads to reader confusion. Also, and this is a small but annoying thing, Rohmer uses words like &quot;settee&quot; and &quot;divan&quot; interchangeably in the same scene, so we never know which he is talking about. But these are quibbles. Minor cavils aside, this is a very suspenseful and memorable entry in the Fu saga.	2002-03-20
US	49963565	RORGSDBMQBP8G	0891908013	933298545	Bride of Fu Manchu	Books	5	6	6	N	N	MORE FU FOR YOUR $$$	This novel, volume 6 of Sax Rohmer's 14 Fu Manchu books, is perhaps the best of the lot so far for the simple reason that we see more of the good Dr. in this tale than in any of the others. The best parts of any Fu Manchu novel are always when Fu himself is present, talking and scheming and gloating and explaining, and in this book we see a LOT of him. This book marks another departure in the series, in that we have a new narrator (the third so far in the series): Alan Sterling, a botanist buddy of our old friend Dr. Petrie. The setting of the book is unique, too--the French Riviera. As the reader below has astutely observed, the plot of this book--spreading biological plague throughout the world--does seem to have influenced Ian Fleming in his later Bond novel, O.H.M.S.S. But there are other parallels as well. Fu Manchu's garden of deadly plants could be seen as a precursor to Blofeld's suicide gardens in \\"You Only Live Twice,\\" and the character of Fu Manchu himself, as has been pointed out elsewhere, would seem to be an inspiration for the later Dr. No. Does anybody out there know whether or not Fleming was a Rohmer fan? Anyway, this is a terrific and fast-moving tale. The high point of the book occurs when Fu Manchu takes Sterling on a tour of his laboratory, showing him all the plant and animal monstrosities that he has created. This section takes up fully 1/4 of the novel, and is a real showstopper. We are also treated to the usual array of Burmese thugs, knockout drugs, opium use, hypnotism, \\"the Blessing of the Celestial Vision,\\" a sea chase, and even (finally!) the arrest of Fu Manchu himself. Does Fu Manchu get convicted and serve a kajillion years in the slammer, as he deserves? With eight more books in the series to go, what do you think?!?!?!? Anyway, this is an exceptional entry in the Fu Manchu series.	2002-03-11

This book, #5 of 14 in the Fu Manchu series, is a direct continuation of the previous entry, \\"The Daughter of Fu Manchu.\\" Thus, a reading of that earlier story is fairly essential when going into this one. Shan Greville again narrates, and all our old friends are back: Nayland Smith, Dr. Petrie, Orientalist Lionel Barton and his niece, Rima. Comm. Weymouth and Karameneh make only token appearances in this work. Thanks to the essential oil of a rare Burmese orchid, Dr. Fu has attained a new lease on life in this book, and is both stronger and more active than ever. You might call him a brand-new Fu! Fah Lo Suee, his evil but hot-blooded daughter, makes some nice eerie appearances in this tale, as well.<BR>    The story this time concerns Fu's attempts to steal the so-called relics of El Mokanna from Sir Lionel. These relics will enable him to foster an Islamic uprising that will sweep the world. The action jumps from Persia to Cairo, to adventure on the high seas and then back to jolly old London. Mixed in with the usual fast pace we are treated to Ogboni killers, mind-control drugs, dervishes, metal dissolvers, a \\"ghost mosque,\\" and amnesia. One of the high points of the novel is a midnight ransom meeting with Dr. Fu Manchu in the heart of the Great Pyramid; a very memorable sequence indeed. Rohmer even manages to throw in a nice sentimental ending of sorts to this story, in which Fu gets to show what a classy dude he is capable of being. I am docking the book a star because several of the events are not explained (how did Fu get out of the Great Pyramid, anyway?), and because the writing in one or two scenes was a bit fuzzy (I still can't figure out that Ogboni spider-thread pendulum trick). Still, these are minor quibbles. This is essentially a mighty fun read, and a worthy addition to the Fu saga.	2002-03-01

This is book #4 of the 14 Fu Manchu books that Sax Rohmer gave us, and represents something of a departure from the previous three. For one thing, we have a new narrator in this book. Shan Greville, assistant of the Orientalist Sir Lionel Barton (who figured prominently in books 1 and 3), has taken over the narrating duties from Dr. Petrie. For another thing, a good deal of the book's action takes place in Egypt, as opposed to England. AND, this book seems to hold together more as a novel, rather than as a group of linked stories. Fu Manchu himself, believed to be dead after the events of book 3, barely appears in this volume, but his daughter, a chip(py) off the old block if ever there were one, has picked up were Pops left off, and makes things pretty hot for Nayland Smith, Petrie, Inspector Weymouth and some of our other old friends. As usual, the pace is swift, with some outstanding set pieces, including the infiltration of the Si-Fan council in the el-Kharga oasis, and the ultimate appearance of Pops Manchu himself. We are also treated to mummy tombs, zombie drugs, assassins of various sorts, hypnosis, poison sprays and so on. All in all, this is a very good entry in the Fu series.	2002-02-20

In this, the third of 14 Fu Manchu books that Sax Rohmer gave the world, Comm. Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie continue to battle the evil genius Fu Manchu. This book introduces the Si-Fan, a mysterious Eastern organization dedicated to conquering the Western world. The book follows directly from the previous two volumes, and includes several familiar characters. Thus, a reading of the previous books is recommended before going into this one. I'd give this book one star less than the previous two, if only because, as good a writer as Rohmer is, some of the sections of the book are, for me anyway, too vaguely drawn. The geography of the Si-Fan house and of the chapel of Monkswell, for example, are quite hard to picture; your imagination will be working overtime in these sections. (Perhaps this is deliberate on the part of the author?) Several plot points (Hale's mysterious chest, a woman who may or may not be a supreme Empress of sorts) are left in the air, possibly to be resolved in future volumes. There ARE some outstanding set pieces in the book, including the forced operation on Fu-Manchu's bullet-ridden skull and the insect-guarded labyrinth under Graywater Park. The book also features poisonous flowers, an opium den, mysterious codes, a hashish house, kidnappings, fires, leopards, storms and on and on. The pace, as usual for the Fu books, is quite breathless. There's no way that a reader will be bored.	2002-02-12

A reading of the previous book WOULD be helpful for a full enjoyment of this volume, but is not absolutely necessary. Like the first book, this one is jam-packed with fast-moving action and bizarre adventure. It is surprisingly well written; sometimes even elegantly written. Just note the description of the seedy East End in Chapter 11 and you may want to upgrade your assessment of Rohmer as a wordsmith. Anyway, this particular installment of Nayland Smith and Dr. Petrie's war against the evil genius Fu Manchu includes kidnappings, wire-jacket torture, poisonous cats, snake murders, albino peacocks, killer apes, quicksand, a haunted house, rat torture, mummy attacks and on and on.

Like I said, Rohmer throws a lot into this one, all for the pleasure of the adventure-loving reader. Who cares if it's not PC?

This is a terrific, beautifully written, literate sci-fi novel, with dozens of passages so quotable that you may feel the need to underline or highlight them. In this book, Martians have been living on Earth for thousands of years in hidden underground cities. For the most part, they are benevolent observers of human affairs, but there are some, the so-called Abdicators, who seek to overthrow and do away with mankind. This novel deals with the attempt of one of these Abdicators to corrupt a gifted human boy, and the attempt of one of the other observers to prevent it. Before the novel ends, the earth has gone through a major disaster, but there is still hope for man's ultimate fate. The author, Edgar Pangborn, takes his time with the story, and the characters are well drawn and believable. There's lots of poetic imagery and quasi-religious symbolism, as well as a good number of startling surprises. Seek this book out...it's a winner!	2001-08-16

This is the last of the 14 Allan Quatermain novels that H.

In this final book, Quatermain again partakes of the taduki drug, as he did in the previous two novels, and gets to see a previous incarnation of his--when he was Wi, the leader of a small tribe during one of the Ice Ages. The story is simply written but zips along at a brisk pace. There are several terrific action set pieces: Wi's fight with Henga, the previous chief of the tribe; the trapping of the wolf pack; the fight with the sabertooth; the battle with the Redbeards; the showdown with the aurochs; and the final cataclysm. The members of the tribe are sharply and sometimes humorously drawn. (Rudyard Kipling helped Haggard with the planning of this novel.)

Lady Ragnall returns in this one, and shares Quatermain's drug-induced vision. While not as battle intensive as other books in the series, this novel is always interesting, and does feature, amongst other things, a lion hunt, a blind wizard in a cave, a visit to Ethiopia, a fight with a crocodile, and a rousing climactic battle between the forces of the Persians and the allied Egyptian/Ethiopian armies.

Also referenced are other Quatermain novels such as \\"Marie,\\" \\"Child of Storm\\" and  \\"Allan's Wife,\\" and while a knowledge of these earlier books will make for a richer experience, \\"Ivory Child\\" can certainly be read on its own. In this one, Quatermain goes on a quest to find his buddy's kidnapped wife (in that respect, it is similar to \\"Holy Flower\\"), but also gets involved in a lost tribe's civil war. Thrown into the mix are a gigantic and evil elephant god, a monster snake guardian (the possible inspiration for all those snake gods in Robert E. Howard's Conan tales), several great battle scenes, psychic visions, drug use, a hailstorm, Egyptology, a shooting competition, a sandstorm, etc. Haggard throws quite a bit into this one to ensure a good time. And for fans of Hans, Quatermain's heroic and amusing Hottentot sidekick, this one provides quite a little tearjerker ending. It's all wonderfully pulpy and quite amusing; a ripping good yarn, as they used to say. So seek this one out on Amazon it'll reward your efforts!	2001-06-04

Rider Haggard wrote (starting with &quot;King Solomon's Mines&quot;) depicting the adventures of Allan Quatermain, great English hunter in the wilds of mysterious Africa. I was a little worried when I started this book, as it took around 1 1/2 whole pages to get going, but then the next 394 pages proved just as action-packed, fast-moving and entertaining as can be. The story concerns an expedition for a very rare orchid, and the search for the kidnapped wife of one of Quatermain's friends. There are any number of tremendous battle scenes, and before all is said and done, we have run up against a giant gorilla god, cannibals, slave traders, a very suspenseful lake chase, evil wizards, a hidden volcanic sanctuary...and on and on. And for fans of Quatermain's Hottentot sidekick, Hans, let me add that this great character has rarely been shown in a more humorous or heroic light. Haggard's imagination seemed to be working overtime on this book, and despite an occasional inconsistency here and there (e.g., in one spot he writes that the Mother of the Flower is always eaten by her followers, and later on he writes that they are buried), the result is one tremendously entertaining yarn. What an incredible movie this would make, if done faithfully! It is a real shame that this book has been out of print for so long and is so hard to find now. It is well worth searching out.	2001-05-30
US	49963565	R1YMTLXOD5710W	0486203077	38671841	Tales of Terror and the Supernatural	Books	4	12	12	N	N	A MISLEADING TITLE	A very entertaining bunch of short stories, with a misleading title. Of the dozen stories in this book, only two could possibly be deemed supernatural, and even those two might have more mundane explanations for the events described. Two other stories in this collection might be called action/suspense tales. But the others have nothing to do with terror or the supernatural at all. Rather, they are mysteries, or tales of false identity, or tales of blackmail, or of suspicion. All eminently readable, and all good fun. My favorite story in the book is &quot;Mad Monkton,&quot; one of the tales with a more supernatural cast. This longish story takes its time but builds to a very satisfying conclusion. The mystery tales show Collins developing the type of format he would later perfect in &quot;The Woman in White&quot; and &quot;The Moonstone.&quot; I feel that any fan of Collins would enjoy these varied stories. Just don't go in expecting a really scary time.	2000-10-10

Happily, I found the comparison to be a  fair one, and the rating to be just. This is one terrific science fiction  novel, as fast paced and colorful as the Bester novel, and featuring a  similar use of colorful characters and extravagant imagination. It is  really quite impressive how Charles Harness manages to incorporate some  fantastic surprise or bit of mind-blowing scientific hypothesizing into  every single chapter. Einsteinian theories of the universe, Toynbeean  history and non-Aristotelian philosophy are all mixed into a swashbuckling  and fast-moving pulp story, with a backdrop of a technologically advanced  society on the decline. The story jumps from the Earth to the moon to  Mercury and finally to a &quot;solarion,&quot; a station that hovers over a  sunspot to process the energy of the sun itself. It's all wild and  improbable and quite irresistible stuff, if you're game. I highly recommend  it.	2000-07-25

Rider Haggard's so-called Zulu trilogy, the first two novels being &quot;Marie&quot; and &quot;Child of Storm.&quot; This is a magnificent set of books that deals  with the downfall of the Zulu people, as personally witnessed by Allan  Quatermain, the hero of 14 of Haggard's novels, including &quot;King  Solomon's Mines.&quot; &quot;Finished&quot; has all the elements that  Haggard's fans have come to expect from him: a great and fast-moving story,  scenes of big-game hunting, interesting and amusing characters, bloody and  well-described battles, all with a dash of mysticism and some supernatural  elements thrown into the mix. It is a real rouser. In the first half of  this book, our hero Quatermain gets personally involved in the problems of  a young couple in the bush veld in Africa, but the entire second half of  the book details his stay with the Zulus, their war councils, and the great  battles that the Zulus fought against the English in the late 1870s. The  tone of the book is suitably elegiac, mourning the passing of a proud  people and culture. This is a magnificent trilogy of books, and it is a  real shame that they are all out of print. But I heartily recommend that  you seek them out.	2000-05-22
US	49963565	RYTZ2XLOS7VJ5	158715028X	335009470	Marie: An Episode in the Life of the Late Allan Quatermain	Books	5	39	39	N	N	ONE OF THE BEST OF THE QUATERMAINS	This is one of the best works by H. Rider Haggard that I've read, and I've read a good number of them. This is the tale of how Allan Quatermain, hero of 14 of Haggard's books, including &quot;King Solomon's Mines,&quot; met  his first wife. It is set against the time of the Great Trek in the 1830s,  and is jammed with action, adventure and romance. There are two terrific  villains, Dingaan (brother of Chaka) and a Portuguese who's trying to not  only kill our hero, but rob him of his wife in the bargain. The book starts  out with a thrilling battle scene, and ends with a scene of tremendous  emotional intensity. In between there is so much colorful action and  movement that you find yourself zipping through the chapters as quickly as  you can. The book is a true &quot;page turner,&quot; with great sweep and  drive. The supporting characters are either colorful, comedic or memorable.  Hans--Quatermain's Hottentot sidekick from many of the other books--is  featured here, too, and his is always a welcome presence. What a shame that  this book has been out of print for so many years, along with the great  preponderance of the other works of this wonderful writer. Haggard has been  called the greatest adventure fantasist of all time, and I would tend to  agree with that assessment. So do yourself a favor and go to the trouble of  seeking this book out. It will reward your efforts!	2000-03-01
