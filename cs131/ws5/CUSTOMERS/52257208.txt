Who exactly was the man who had the plastic surgery and jumped off the building? Why would Klara claim to be the wolf? What pressing business did Patterson have that kept him from re-writing this pitiful ending?	2004-11-27

It's not Lindsey's best work, but it's a good read and worth the money. This is an engaging series and should be expanded to include the experiences of the women abducted from Kystran in the first book...hint, hint.	2001-05-01

Perhaps he is forgetting that half the voters in this country voted for each candidate, or perhaps he doesn't mind alienating half his readers. The fact is, Mr. King is an author, not a national leader or opinion maker or policy setter and if the public wants to know his political views, we'll ask. As for me, I've bought my last King novel.	2001-04-04

Ms. Cullman begins with a tender, touching story of two likeable interesting people, carries the tale almost to the end, and then inserts a grating, stupid episode with witchcraft and magic that completely destroys the mood and the tempo. This element of fantasy is completely out of character for the story, badly written, and totally annoying. Anne McCaffrey she is not! The final few pages get back to the tone characterizing the first portion of the book, but my goodness, it's as if two authors,one of whom is an inept clown, wrote this book....	2001-02-18

I snapped it up, thinking I'd be getting the same quality book from this author as The Abduction, and finding her new effort to be draggy, long, boring, and uninspired. The heroine is a nitwit and the hero is unlikeable. The other characters are tired cliches. I cannot recommend this book to anyone, for any reason.	2001-01-13

Shame on them and shame on me! This book is too wordy, too convoluted, completely unbelievable, and hasn't a likeable character in it - not a single one.You'll die of boredom waiting to get to an interesting page.

Every page is packed with information about the times, the mores, the texture and taste of the characters.  Thorfinn MacBeth and Gruoch are so clearly illustrated that it becomes painful to finish the book, knowing from history's tale exactly what end they both meet. This author is the equivalent - in this novel, anyway - of the aesthete's Diana Gabaldon. A very interesting minor character is Luloecen, and I sincerely wish the author had written a separate volume on him.	2000-10-14

I read approximately one book each day and tend to be forgiving of authors' faults but this one...what a stinker! It seems like one long run-on sentence. And frankly, a lot of what it says is just plain offensive. I am not a Catholic, nor a crusader, nor a Moslem but this book is just revolting in the things said about all three of those categories. For that matter, I am not a cannibal either, and even cannibals would be offended by this author's claims.	2000-10-04

The story dances along entertainingly, and then, just at the end, loses its steam, poops out, falls through, whatever you want to call it. I do think this book holds up better than her first book, Potent Pleasures. I am hoping that she overcomes this failing by her third book.	2000-10-04

I have seldom read a weaker, more disorganized conclusion to a book. Somebody should spank her editor.	2000-10-04

It is not believable, in that Civil War era ladies never swore and no civil  war era hero would tolerate profanity of the sort spouted by this crude  heroine. Nor are the heroine's interactions with her long lost daughter  believable! The writer certainly shows promise, but she has a long way to  go. Entire passages of this novel just make the reader wince. I can't  believe that the other reader reviews are so enthusiastic. I read an  average of one romance novel a day, and this book is NOT a five star  effort.	2000-09-01

Yevgenia Ginzberg has authored the moving books of the  &quot;whirlwind&quot; saga, but they are pale and boring compared to her  son's books: Generations of Winter and The Winter's Hero. There was a lot  more to the Stalin era than the gulag, and her son, Vasily Aksoyonov, who  grew up in the gulag, tells the story of Russia much more movingly.

The leading lady is intelligent and practical, and it is enjoyable watching her turn from a mousy frump into a heartstopping temptress. Alex's responses to her are also believable and entertaining.

I read two pages of it at home and I realized I had paraded all over the store with \\"PORNOGRAPHY\\" snuggled in my  arms! I was mortified! (Also electrified - I then read it cover to cover in  one sitting...)What a joke on me! My reputation will never be the same -  but now I'm at Amazon, searching for everything else she's ever  written...and I'll take it home in a plain brown wrapper, hee hee. The  writing is very similar to Anne Rice's erotica. I wish, however, that the  book had been fleshed out a little more - Ms. Schone gives us teasing  glimpses of &quot;the rest of the story&quot;...I want to know what Anne  thought as she watched him dance at her come-out. I want to know about all  his other lovers. I want to know about Michel's education in the brothel. I  want more!	2000-04-07

It is not a romance, nor is it purely ahistorical novel. It reads like someone's rejected master's thesis dressed up to look like romance.  The author manages to offend nearly every religion, slandering catholics and protestants and muslims alike. Usually I resell my books when I've finished with them, but this one went straight into the trash can. If Ms. Kyle wants to write some New Age exploration of spirituality, she should make her subject clear from the beginning. This is a truly awful assault on all religions.  END	2000-04-04

I think he is an unlucky man  who has lost his great love.  Revelations about the suspicious death of  Diana's bodyguard (and previous lover) as well as quotes from her about the  bodyguard's death make the book worth the purchase price.  All the problems  with his career and personal life after the exposure of their affair  certainly don't paint the Palace in a flattering light.  This is a moving  account of a doomed relationship and the painful consequences that  followed. I hope Major Hewitt is able to find happiness in his life, and I  hope M6 and Buckingham Palace leave him alone.	2000-01-07
