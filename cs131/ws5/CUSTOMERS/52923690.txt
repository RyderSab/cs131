The action ranges from China to Washington, D.C. to the Olympic rain forest and points in between, and the story is told in several voices which are as distinct and characteristic as they are engaging.  The characterization is strong, the pace is brisk without being rushed, the surprises are neither telegraphed or short-changed, and the whole thing is an absolute hoot from start to finish (in the sense of being great fun).  Penz resists the temptation to tie everything up in too tidy a bundle at the end of the novel, so that the intrigue lives on when the last page is turned -- in other words, it delivers (grin).  I particularly enjoyed the integration of long-dead voices into the living narrative, phonetic spelling and all.  Recommended for a fun read, but maybe not to take camping with you if you're going to the woods!	2005-10-09

At the World Science Fiction convention the next year I bought a subscription to a little zine called &quot;Speculations,&quot; and found in it an advice column called &quot;Ask Bwana.&quot;<br />I didn't know who Bwana was or why people would be asking him questions.  What I found out immediately was that he had informed, thoughtful answers to questions that were uppermost in my mind.  What does it mean when.  Do you think that I should.  Is it a good idea to.  Why do you advise against.  This was good grounding, centering advice that made a real difference to me as I struggled to figure out where I was and what I was supposed to be doing next.<br />This book, The Science Fiction Professional:  Seven Years of &quot;Ask Bwana&quot; Columns, is a collection of that material from the zine &quot;Speculations.&quot;  I bought it this year at the World Science Fiction Convention in San Jose, took it home, sat down to read it, and remembered how nourishing and informative Bwana's columns can be.<br />Bwana covers all sorts of topics of interest from response times, appropriate markets, reprint rights, and workshopping.  His advice is always cogent and easy to understand.  He doesn't talk around subjects; some people find him too blunt, on some topics.<br />This is ultimately a very useful, supportive, positive book for the use of beginning and intermediate writers as they sort out the requirements of their situation and make that all-important decision on what to do next.  As a beginning writer on the road to intermediate, I recommend &quot;The Science Fiction Professional&quot; without reservation!	2003-02-03

Why were Scott's people wearing fabric clothing?  Because fur clothing would have been too hot for manhauling.  This is an entirely reasonable answer to the wrong question.  The expedition had ponies, dogs, and motor-sledges, and yet the expedition was dressed for man-hauling; and why was that?  That underlying decision process may have been a good one, but it is not touched on, leaving us with a good answer to the wrong question.<br />The author's election of a frame-story puts me in mind of that used by Josephine Tey for her wonderful &quot;The Daughter of Time.&quot;  I enjoyed reading the real-time comparisions but quickly got tired of being preached at, and I find remarks such as &quot;The visitor shakes his head at his own ignorant failure to truly grasp . . . the enormity of the task that Scott and his men faced&quot; (p. 264) to be unnecessarily confrontational.<br />Susan Solomon writes well; I have no doubt that she is very intelligent, highly educated, passionate about her subject, and persuaded that an historical injustice has been committed.  This book earns three stars well and truly for the shocking implications of the final chapter, &quot;The Winds of Chance and Choice.&quot;  <br />Her book sheds interesting light on what was going on during the Scott expedition, and I fully empathize with her desire to right what clearly seems to her to be a grotesque wrong done in the court of public opinion to Captain Scott's memory.  She vigorously defends Scott on several issues raised about his decisions and conduct, frequently by shifting the blame to his subordinates -- a tactic distasteful to people with a military background.  But her answers are to the wrong questions, and the book provides no grounds for defense of Captain Scott against many of the pertinent questions raised about avoidable errors of judgment contributory to the failure of the Scott polar expedition beyond that of &quot;He made a mistake.&quot;	2001-12-28

As a [homosexual] woman I'm always a little bit concerned about how convincingly a flaming heterosexual can write [homosexual] and bi women; but Sanders hooked me from page 1.<br />This is a seemingly simple story:  girl meets girl meets girl, and she is them.  There's action and adventure, violence, nudity,... experimentation, chase scenes, post-nuclear dystopia, and quantum mechanics, not to mention a woman so butch she defines her type -- the boots, the eyepatch, the heavy artillery . . . is it just me, or is it getting warm in here?  But nothing is as simple as it looks, and the structural and psychological resonances of this book only start with Sanders' provocative choice of a title that invokes some of the most famous linear narrative issues of our time.<br />Will Sanders' ferocious technical discipline is all but invisible beneath the ease and mastery of his story-telling.  This novel moves like a late model German import luxury car on a freeway in Montana -- smooth, persuasive, and when it pulls up in front of your doorstep to let you back out into your life again you'll be surprised that you're there already . . . sorry that the ride's over . . . and ready to do it all over again.<br />I know you'll enjoy the ride.

This book is a treasure.  There is honestly no predicting where Ray is going to go from moment to moment, but it's all perfectly in character within the context of the story, and the closest I can come to expressing what's going on with Vukcevich's prose is to tell you that it's genuinely original.  He'll take you by surprise time and again, but delight you while he's doing it.<br />Many times when one is reading a book of short stories one begins to predict the endings of stories, or at least the style and tone of stories, three-quarters of the way through the collection.  I couldn't begin to get there with this book:  it was fresh from start to finish.<br />So:  buy this book if you want something that is fresh, innovative, original, imaginative, intelligent, and diverting.  I think that once you read Ray Vukcevich you'll want to read everything you can find by Ray Vukcevich.  Give him a try!  You won't be sorry!	2001-08-10

This is great fun.  You're gonna like Phil, you're gonna  emphathize with his problems, you're going to be glad it's him -- and not  you -- running from one end of Hades to the other in pursuit of and being  pursued by the Ungodly.  <br />A fun book, engagingly presented in a prose  style perfectly matched to its subject matter, &quot;Darkers&quot; is a  great way to spend a few hours when you need to get away from it all.

I would  emphatically read it in concert with David Woodman's &quot;Strangers Among  Us,&quot; a careful analysis of the Inuit testimony received by Hall that  provides what may be the last word on the fate of the Franklin expedition  from the descendants of people who made periodic contact with the men from  the Erebus and Terror at various points during the painful deterioration of  ships and crew.<br />This book, now back in print, should not be missed by  people with an interest in nineteenth century British and U.S. experiences  in the Arctic.  It has drama and human interest all its own, and deserves  its place in the literature of Polar exploration in general, John  Franklin's last expedition in particular.	2000-06-12

Years after Hall, David Woodman's careful  analysis of Inuit narratives does much to separate lines of history from  complex story-telling.  This book describes the ways in which the Inuit  testimony can be validated and what things it has to report to us about  what may have happened to the Franklin expedition.  As such it contains  what may be the first real &quot;new&quot; information about the Franklin  expedition that we are likely to obtain absent startling new finds in the  region.<br />Though Scott Cookman's new study &quot;Ice Blink&quot; has  genuine insights to offer on the possible reasons for the evident  deterioration of the Franklin expedition after its first year in the ice,  Woodman's &quot;Strangers Among Us&quot; ultimately provides more  information on exactly what happened -- and invaluable information from  Inuit hunting peoples about why it might have happened at that time and in  that place.<br />If you are interested in the historical mysteries of the  third Franklin expedition this book should not be missed.	2000-06-12

Vukcevich avoids that trap, however.  <br />The  technical underpinnings of his novel are flawless, and each and every  potential &quot;gimmick&quot; fully supports its piece of the plot  mechanics.  Nothing is thrown away here, nothing is wasted, and it all  comes together in the end without straining credulity or over-burdening  one's suspension of disbelief.<br />I haven't had so much fun with a novel  since I read Daniel Pinkwater's books about the Snark-out Boys.	2000-06-03

The most  pleasant surprise for me, however, was reading about the African  expeditions; new information for me, and engagingly presented as  well.<br />You will find it well written and striking a nice balance between  presenting sufficient information to communicate the gravity of the issues  faced by &quot;Barrow's boys,&quot; and overwhelming the casual reader with  too much information.  <br />The history of the interactions between Barrow  and those Rosses is particularly engaging, and tempts me to revisit M.J.  Ross' very thorough joint biography of Captain John Ross and Sir James  Clark Ross (Polar Pioneers : John Ross and James Clark Ross).<br />An  interesting book, beautifully written, and full of unexpected wry humor,  light but not light-weight; I enthusiastically recommend this book to  persons interested in British polar exploration, the Franklin expeditions,  and the decades-long animosity between Barrow and Captain John Ross.	2000-05-04

(Captain John Ross' operant procedure for  the prevention of scurvy deserves respect and praise.)  At the same time  neither of these gents was perfect in every respect, and Captain John Ross'  career may be said never to have recovered from a premature decision he  made to abandon a search for the Northwest Passage based on a disputed  sighting of a mountain chain (later found to be non-existant) that would  have made northerly progress impossible.<br />This book presents the  accomplishments, and errors, of uncle and nephew in full recognition of  their human failings and failures of judgment; but appropriately credits  them for their accomplishments -- which are unexpectedly significant when  seen as a whole.<br />It also traces the history of the animosity that existed  between Captain John Ross and Secretary of the Admiralty John Barrow -- a  relationship characterized by sometimes truly puzzling venom.  It seems  pretty funny now to read about the violence and vitriol with which the two  of them spoke of each other in print, and there is probably something to be  said about the cultural environment then versus now; but the conflict was  very real, and had very real -- sometimes tragic -- repercussions.<br />This  book may be very profitably read either by itself -- for the entertainment  and interest it provides -- or in conjunction with Fergus Fleming's  &quot;Barrow's Boys,&quot; which also provides a window on the tension  between Barrow and Captain John Ross (one is tempted to say, sometimes  between Captain John Ross and the world).<br />It is a biography that covers a  remarkable span of Polar exploration during the glory years of Royal Navy  expeditions.

This book tells all about orchard mason bees (and some other native pollinators), what they look like, what they do, why they're particularly good at it, and most of all how we can help.<br />Orchard mason bees are not  honeybees but a small, modest, hard-working, solitary little bee native to  the New World.  They mind their own business and do a whale of a job  pollinating.  My blueberry bushes have doubled and tripled their yields  since I started putting homes out for the orchard mason bees.<br />The  pictures of the bee-faces in the section on telling the difference between  the boy bees and the lady bees are cute.  But the text, while not heavy in  the least, is serious.  Here is a man who believes in his bees and in ways  in which we can acknowledge our part in the natural order by helping offset  the pernicious effects of excess urbanization.  The text is written at the  layman's level; no technical knowledge is required to read and understand,  but there are references for people who want to get more deeply involved  with technical issues.<br />Here is everything you will need to know to decide  whether you would like to harbor orchard mason bees and how to go about it  if you do.<br />I got my first bee block from Knox Farms several years ago and  upgraded to a bee condo last year.  This year I took my courage in my hands  and carefully changed my bee-full nesting tubes for clean ones to wait for  spring.  It was fascinating handling those tubes stuffed with beneficient  bee life!  I think this would be a great thing for kids to get involved  with. (I'm fourty-something, and I think it's great).<br />If you are  interested in giving a hard-working native bee a hand, and benefitting all  of the fruit and berry plants in your neighborhood, I cannot recommend this  book highly enough.

Existing references were  out of print or otherwise unavailable . . . until now!  <br />The Ghosts of  Cape Sabine tells the complete story of the Greely expedition to Lady Jane  Franklin Bay.  The ghastly mismanagement of the relief and rescue  expeditions must be read to be believed, but it is all true.  Guttridge's  research uses previously unconsulted archival information to present a  deeply affecting picture of the emotions and aspirations of the men of the  expedition.  Of particular interest to me was his exploration of the ways  in which Greely's own perhaps over-careful instructions for relief and  reprovisioning can be said to have contributed to the disaster that befell  the expedition.<br />Under conditions of appalling stress and privation  Greely's leadership was tested more severely than it had been even under  fire, and it can be said that it was found wanting to an extent.  Not every  man can be a Shackleton.  And still he brought every man in his command  alive to Cape Sabine, and could have brought them all back home again -- if  only, if only.<br />Guttridge is a fair and sympathetic historian who declines  to either idolize or demonize, treating the personalities involved with  compassion and respect.  This book is an invaluable contribution to the  literature of polar exploration.  He writes well and with persuasive  conviction, and does an altogether too effective job of communicating the  horrors of Cape Sabine without stooping to sensationalism.<br />My thanks to  Leonard Guttridge for making this story available one again -- and now I  have to go look up his story about the Jeanette!	2000-02-07

I found the book easy to read, well researched, convincing,  and more than adequately documented for anyone who might wish to explore  some of the author's conclusions further.  <br />  Most poignantly, the book  ends with an anxious eye to North Korea.  The author's anguished conviction  that &quot;it will happen/is happening, all over again&quot; has been all  too persuasively supported by evidence from humanitarian organizations that  is all too easy to ignore by those of us who enjoy the standard of living  made possible by a modern capitalistic state.  <br />There will always be  apologists and wishful thinkers who attack from a baseline ideology  divorced from historical fact.

There is no  better source for information on Scott's career, Amundsen's life and  exploration, or the polar bids of either man available in English today.   Mr. Huntford's research and presentation are remarkable.  This is a  wonderful book and great fun to read, and you will be the richer for the  time you spend with the people who populate its pages.  My greatest regret  on completing the book was that there were not another five chapters for me  to read yet (and fortunately for me there are the author's biographies of  Shackleton and Nansen to be had).  <br />  Truly one of the cornerstones of  the modern literature of Antarctic exploration!	2000-01-12

Engagingly written and well researched, its perspective casts an interesting light on aspects of  Scott's first Antarctic expedition that have been passed over in general  works on Scott in favor of the drama of the second expedition.  The first  expedition had ample drama of its own, and the author's take on such  personalities as Clements Markham, Shackleton, and Scott himself is  different enough from &quot;standard received&quot; to merit reading.  I  was particularly interested in the author's description of the interplay  between Scott's orders as he received them and perceived them and  subsequent criticism of the expedition for its failure to maximize the  results obtained for the resources invested.<br /><br />  All in all, readable,  informative, interesting, and well worth a read.  You will find the point  of view rather different from that so persuasively presented by Roland  Huntford in his recently re-released &quot;Scott and Amundsen,&quot; but  partisanship -- if so strong a term may be used -- intrudes only  occasionally, and then only in instances in which the author feels unfair  misrepresentation may have done violence to the historical record.<br /><br />  I  enjoyed this book!	1999-12-26

One is not really surprised to find the bulk of  the text taken up with following Dr. Cook's career in light of the fact  that his has been the more controversial vita.<br /><br />My previous exposure to  this controversy has been all on the Peary side and I found this narrative  to be a real eye-opener in multiple respects.  My understanding of the  issues, and my sympathies for both men, are quite altered as a result of  having read this book.<br /><br />The partisan passion that Cook versus Peary  still arouses in the hearts and minds of intelligent and otherwise rational  people is astounding.  This book is a real gem on multiple levels:  not  just for its careful assembly of facts, claims, and suppositions, but for  what it has to say about media -- mass communications -- and the psychology  of explorers and the people who support them.<br />Finally, I found this to be  an amazingly graceful read for a book of its size -- so absorbing that I  found myself regretfully approaching the end of the book in half the time  expected.  Well written, well researched, carefully presented -- a great  book to have in the library!	1999-12-26

Kurt's &quot;married to the mountain&quot; prose and his personal  honesty make this a genuine monument in the literature.	1999-08-30

I found the book a  well-written survey of popular opinion and response to polar exploration in  England that presents an interesting thought:  the idea that the ultimate  source of Scott's disaster in the Antarctic may not have been stupidity,  ego, arrogance, or any of the character flaws with which Robert F. Scott  has been charged so much as hopeless romanticism (a character flaw all its  own, true enough, which may contain elements of All Of The Above).	1999-07-22

Conrad is surely one of the top ten  masters of the narrative form in English for all time.  If you can get away  from your own ego for long enough to listen to his voice you will see  things and learn things you cannot otherwise imagine . . . and you will get  away from your own ego, which is a positive good in itself.<br />Please read  Conrad.  Never stop reading Conrad.  If I believed that I could write one  work like Heart of Darkness I would believe my entire existance justified  by that alone.	1999-04-23

In light of more recent understanding about altitude sickness and the  pernicious effects of &quot;thin air&quot; on rational function the  description of this expedition's strategy for summitting and the sheer  number of days members of this party spent at what we would now call  killing altitudes boggles the mind.  <br />The 1939 K2 expedition remains a  milestone in the mountaineering literature for the cautionary tale it  represents.  Reading about the differences between challenging a mountain  then versus challenging a mountain now is fascinating.  Especially  interesting to me was the discussion of how only newly available  information illuminates one of the critical controversies surrounding the  expedition.	1998-09-16

The discussion of the information available  about the rape of Nanking and how political considerations militated  against full public acknowledgment of the horrific event was for me the  most involving portion of the book.	1998-09-16

The story-line, however, is in the end conventional to the point of becoming a bit of a disappointment.	1998-09-16

It contains wonderful  excerpts from the literature of mountaineering/alpinism/rock climbing,  people who take themselves seriously, people who don't take themselves  seriously, moments from the history of mountaineering that form alps of  their own (you should pardon the cliche) in the literature.<br />I would  consider this to be an excellent volume for anyone who has just finished  =Into Thin Air= or =The Climb= and who would like to find more to read in  the genre.  Harvesting the citation list alone is going to keep my reading  pile fat and happy for months!<br />Disclaimer:  I'm not a mountain-climber,  and I don't play one on TV; I'm just an average wage slug who enjoys a good  story well told.	1998-09-16

The author's participatory study is illuminating and her subject matter interesting, but one thing I remember above all -- her prose style, the manner in which she communicates, is of the highest order for a study of this sort.  This author is worth reading wherever you find her for her literary value alone, let alone the light she sheds on an important and little-understood aspect of Korean life.  Go read!!	1998-05-29

I recommend for maximum enjoyment that one read Helldorado, Triggernometry, and Myers' (?) Outlaws and Desperados of the West (maybe also some of Jahn's book on Doc Holliday) prior to this book in order for fullest appreciation of the author's points.  Well-researched and well-written, as well as being a hoot.	1998-04-07

I can understand how earlier reviewers taking Lake's claim to have received 100% of his facts from Earp, only from Earp, and entirely from Earp might have prejudiced people against Wyatt Earp, because there is a certain amount of &quot;The tall lean figure of the fearless . . . &quot; etc.  The introduction puts this into context excellently well and I have no hesitation in recommending this book to people who are interested in the man and his era, with the proviso that they also read other texts (Sadie is referred two once or twice, never by name, during the portion of the narrative that covers Tombstone; Earp's marriage to and subsequent life with Josie (Sadie) Marcus Earp turns up only in the very last chapter -- on the next-to-last page, if I recall correctly).  An excellent summarization of the Wyatt Earp mythos -- perhaps obviously so, since it is created with in large part creating that mythos (g).  Still and all, not a book to be scorned, but to be read with a cross-reference or two at hand.  The prose style holds up very well indeed.	1998-03-23

This is a lovely story with a sweet and compelling romance that comes from unexpected directions and continues into wonder.  Few authors communicate passion so convincingly!	1998-03-01

What I found most interesting was the author's &quot;take&quot; on what he sees as the far-reaching implications of the meaning behind the mindset that enabled the famous Tombstone confrontation.  All in all I quite liked the author's characterization of Wyatt Earp, especially in his concluding remarks.	1998-02-08

This is a lovely little book of engaging discourse by an author whose conversational style is an absolute delight to read.  I expect to be sub-specializing in this author just for the pleasure of listening to him write.	1998-02-08
