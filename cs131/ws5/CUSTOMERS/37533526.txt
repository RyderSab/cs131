The triple alliance was formed by Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy aided by the sick man of Europe, the Ottoman empire. The Allies was formed of the French British and Russians. <br /> <br />The German desire for dominance with Austria's vacillation exacerbated by a lack of diplomatic infrastructure led to mobilization. <br /> <br />The exuberance of patriotism was soon to be replaced by the doleful laments of despair and the checked hopes of a decisive victory. <br /> <br />Within one year the Western front was scarred by a network of trenches pervaded only by the interminable ennui of trench warfare. <br /> <br />That year saw the collapse of the Austrians on the Eastern Front balanced by the victory of the Germans at Gorlice-Tarnow against the Tsar's armies. The Austrians were eventually buttressed by the Germans averting a Russian invasion. <br /> <br />Smaller fronts presented themselves in the German colonies in Africa and the middle east governed by the Ottoman Caliphate. The former were occupied to no great effect and the latter repelled an invasion which did little to deter another. <br /> <br />1916 saw the Jutland and the Somme which the author brings to life with photo and words alike. <br /> <br />By 1917 both France and Russia were experiencing inflation, food shortages and insurrection. The french patriotism waned clenching desperately to an empheral sense of the homeland thus refusing to attack but agreeing to defend. The Russian situation was ripe for the Bolshevik revolution whichamputated a dying limb of the Allied force later replaced by the arms of America. <br /> <br />The Americans entered the war spurred by the German U boat campaign and interference with Mexican American affairs. <br /> <br />1918 saw the collapse of the house of Hollenzorn, Hapsburgs and Ottomans. <br /> <br />The author's penchant for description is delightfully balanced by his analytical prowess giving the reader an incomparable understanding of this apocalyptic event. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-08

White is generally where most of us are...oblivious. When driving be relaxed but constantly aware in code yellow. Code orange is a specific threat such as being cut off. Code red is danger such as impending impact or carjacking. <br />2) Adjust your mirrors properly and ALWAYS be aware of who is behind and to your sides. If you are being followed switch to code orange and make 3 right turns to confirm that you are being followed. Go to a fire or police station. Never go home. <br />3) Practice threshold braking and understand that it is much better to brake fast and hard initially then ease off on braking then the reverse. <br />4) Wear seatbelts <br />5) Avoid the use of cellular phones but keep one with you in case of emergencies. <br />6) RELAX! Never succumb to road rage. This is not only foolish but could get you killed. If someone cuts you off or engages in offensive driving habits let it go. Don't try to get even. Try to be invisible. <br />7) Basic habits to avoid carjacking are elucidated: <br />a) Situational awareness. Use your instincts. If something feels wrong it probably is. <br />b) Lock your call and roll up the windows <br />c) Have your keys out and ready to use <br />d) Be extra vigilant at gas stations <br />e) Be extra vigilant if rear ended. It may not be an \\"accident\\" rather a felony in progress. <br />f) Be extra vigilant approaching your home and in your garage <br />g) Keep your vehicle in good repair <br /> <br />The author also suggests items that should be in your emergency car kit like flashlights, knives, hammer tools, handcuff keys, etc. <br /> <br />Various car maneuvers are described, however, these are best learned by experience and training. <br />	2005-09-20

In my limited mind I see two extremes with a continuum between which has not been fully explored.  <br /> <br />One can believe, as most neuroscientists do, that the mind is nothing more than a consequence of purely physical process'. In it's most extreme form we have functionalism which repudiates any concept of mind outside the physical realm. As we move away from this concept we see various \\"isms\\" rear their head depending upon what modifications one can make to this thesis. If you believe that mind exists but has no influence on brain then you believe in epiphenomalism. Of course if you believe in the functionalist viewpoint and state that you truly do not know if mind exists outside body you subscribe to agnostic physicalism.  Alternatively, if you concede that mind emerges from the brain and can affect the brain but cannot be wholly explained by physical phenomena  then you are an emergent materialist. Going a bit further if you subsribe to the notion that the mind and brain are seperate entities and can affect one another then you hold on to dualistic interactionism. <br /> <br />The discovery of newtonian mechanics was a revolution which explained the unexplainable. Newtonian physics let to various deterministic outlooks in every field including biology and neuroscience. The discovery of quantum physics shattered the belief in deterministic systems and replaced it with probabilistic systems. Here we see a paradigm shift in physics from studying what \\"is\\" to what we can know about what \\"is\\". In the authors words a shift from ontology to epistimology. It is the inertia of newtonian thinking which persists in neuroscience today. <br /> <br />Like the author I subscribe to a mind independent of brain which can influence the brain. Whether quantum mechanics can explain this is an exciting question. <br /> <br />The author uses research in OCD, stroke patients, and the Silver Monkey debacle to argue that directed attention/mental force can alter brain circuitry/processing and that this mental force is not simply a physical process or byproduct of the brain itself. <br /> <br />He clearly explains basic concepts of neurophysiology, neuroanatomy and basic quantum mechanics so the unseasoned reader requires no background knowledge. <br /> <br />He incorporates the ideas of non-locality, quantum zeno effect, anti-realist implications of quantum mechanics and the mysterious collapse of the wave funtion during observation into a theory of mind over brain. <br /> <br />His thinking is that the choice of what to focus on ( Heisenberg choice ) leads to many outcomes of a probabilistic nature ( anti-realist implications of QM ) and that by directing attention one is able to select one possibility from the many ( quantum zeno effect ) which is then actualized ( collapse of the wave function ). <br /> <br />This new way of viewing the brain has many implications not just in philosophy but in clinical medicine, economics, sociology and in fact any science in which one has thinking participants. This has been alluded to in the past by George Soros in applications to market trends. <br /> <br />The main dilemma of course is: who or what is directing the attention in the first place? The author holds that it is free will/soul.  <br /> <br />The author argues pesuasively for abandoning Newtonian explanations for brain function in favour of quantum mechanical explanations. However, the argument provides a mechanism for showing how such a mind-brain interface may work but assumes a priori that there is a distinction between mind and brain.  <br /> <br />The materialists could argue that the quantum mechanical explanation of brain function and functionalism/materialism are not mutually exclusive. They could simply argue that quantum mechanics is simply another physical process, probabilistic not deterministic, but this does not imply there is a will or soul. <br /> <br />Like other great mysteries ( existence of god, life after death, etc )free will remains an enigma and you either believe in it or you don't. <br /> <br />Unlike like our predecessors we now have an explanation of how such a mind-brain interface may work. <br />	2005-08-07

Indians against English. Indians against Indians. <br /> <br />The story has a simple plot consisting of a repetition of capture and escape with frequent role reversals punctuated by brief reprieves serving to build tension. <br /> <br />Although truly an action story, complete with a mythic hero ( Hawkeye ) who will serve as the foundation for the modern day cowboy, the tale touches on deeper issues in a subtle way. <br /> <br />The friction of interracial amour is personified in Uncas and Cora. Their demise perhaps reflecting the authors views on transcultural relationships. <br /> <br />The  stereotyping of blonde women is brought into sharp focus in Alice's helplessness which seems never to leave her. Her character undergoes little development beyond a cardboard cutout  set on a richly detailed stage adding to the effect. In contrast the dark haired Cora is seen to be a courageous practical woman embodying the frontierswoman. <br /> <br />The struggle between civilization and savagery in the frontier is continually brought out in the conflicts with Magua, although Cooper is careful to balance his character avoiding simple dichotomous categorization into evil and good . Magua is cruel spiteful and villainous from the protagonist's perspective yet we are allowed access to Magua's thoughts and realize he wishes to live a good life in his own way and earn the respect of his people. His unslaked vengeance is his ultimate downfall. <br /> <br />I wasnt particularly fond of the movie which is two dimensional ( literally and figuratively ) and strongly suggest reading the book.	2005-08-02

I must say I am not overly taken to reading romantic novels but I made an exception in this case.<br /><br />It was singularly refreshing to read about a female heroine, especially one as well developed as Elizabeth, written at a time when women were seen as nothing more than a means to wealth or progeny through the institution of marriage.<br /><br />We see in this novel the undercurrents of societal bias and the expectations put on women to marry in light of their limited role in society at the time. The novel comments on a wide variety of marital arrangements ranging from those of pure convenience to those based on love each with amusing consequences.<br /><br />In reading this one is rewarded with a wide variety of well developed characters written by an author who has an eerie command of the english language.<br /><br />I was so impressed with the attention to detail and psychological commentary ( hence the title pride and prejudice ) that I have resolved to read the other 5 novels written by Jane Austen.	2005-08-02

Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits are introduced. <br /> <br />Chapter 4 -  so far the book has dealt with passive circuits. The authors now turn to active circuits. Transistors and OP amps are introduced with 4 basic signalling functions namely inverting/noninverting amps, diff amp and inverting summer. These are combined in different ways to give different signal processing properties. Analysis of op amp circuits is presented using nodal analysis techniques. <br /> <br />Chapter 5-  now the authors deal with signal waveforms in particular step functions, exponential waveforms and sinusoidal waveforms. <br /> <br />Chapter 6 introduces the capacitor and inductor along with their I-V relationships and parallel and series reductions. These are then applied to active circuits and we obtain two other basic op amp circuits namely the integrator and differentiator. <br /> <br />Chapter 7 deals with 1st and 2nd order circuits so named since they are described by first and second order diff eq. RC and RL circuits are discussed followed by step and sinusoidal responses of 1st order circuits. RLC series and parallel circuits are next followed by step and sinusoidal responses of 2nd order circuits. <br /> <br />Chapter 8 is of a mathematical nature dealing with the use of phasors and sinusoidal steady state response. Phasor analysis is introduced with corresponding KVL and KCL laws and various circuit theorems. The concept of impedence is explained clearly.   <br /> <br />Chapter 9 deals with Laplace transforms and their mathematical properties. One learnshow to write them and to use the inverse transform to get back to the time domain from the \\"s\\" domain. <br />Simple circuit analysis using Laplace transforms is shown. One writes the diff eq for the circuit, converts it to s domain using laplace transform, you solve it using algebraic techniques and then use the inverse transform. <br /> <br />Chapter 10 gives you more theorems to use in s-domain analysis. The equivalent circuit theorems nodal and mesh analysis theorems are presented. We see that s-domain analysis is more than a mathematical trick rather it gives one deeper insight into the circuit. The natural poles allow one to determine the form, stability and observability of the circuits response. <br /> <br />Chapter 11 introduces the concept of network functions ( zero state response to input response in s domain ) in particular transfer ( different ports ) and driving point impedance ( same port ) functions and their use in circuit analysis. We also see how the use of transfer functions allows one to find a steady state response of circuit directly from the transfer function. <br /> <br />Chapter 12 deals with frequency response. Low pass, high pass, passband, and stopband concepts are introduced. Bode plots are explained. <br /> <br />Chapter 13 introduces fourier series and chapter 14 analog filter design <br /> <br />I did not read chapter 15 or 16 <br /> <br />The book is replete with simple exercises progressing to more difficult ones with plenty of worked out examples. <br /> <br />A mature student can cover the material in most of the book in a few weeks . There are really very few basic concepts ( charge, voltage, current, I-V relationships in resistors, inductors, capacitors, natural generalization to impedance, Equivalent circuits with methods of reduction including KCL, KVL, parallel, series, Norton, Thevinen equivalents, nodal and mesh analysis concepts, active components and their properties, types of signal waveforms, steady state responses, phasor analysis, s-domain analysis using Laplace transform, network functions, frequency response principals of filter design and fourier series) numbering 30 or so that are combined in a straightforward way to solving circuit design and analysis problems. <br /> <br />This by no means indicates that circuit analysis and design is easy but rather like most other fields, the concepts are basic but their possible combinations and interactions are almost limitless. Often finding A solution is not enough. One must find a solution that meets several other criteria as well including multi-purpose use, cost efficiency, construction feasibility, etc.	2005-08-01

Perhaps he would not have died from a coronary doubtless related to his depression and alcoholism.<br /><br />The book is told through the impressions of Nick, a middle class fellow, and revolves around Mr. Gatsby. A man who has replaced the fortitude of spirituality with the frailty of materialism in the hopes of acquiring a woman, Daisy, hardly worth his disdain let alone his life.<br /><br />The story reflects the deeper truth that rationality and science alone cannot solve our problems and certainly cannot supplant the need for a higher purpose in life or belief in a higher power. To do so leaves a void too often filled with materialism which is a cheap substitute.<br /><br />This is exemplified in the characters of Tom Daisy and Jordan, souless wraiths who drift aimlessly from place to place  draining the life of everything they touch. Even Tom, who has every conceivable material possession, betrays a longing for days gone by when he was revered as a football hero presumably since this was the only title he ever earned.<br /><br />Gatsby is a compromised and tragic figure partially redeemed only by his solitary quest to fulfull an adolescent meaningless fantasy. Unlike  \\"old money\\" he has a goal however trivial.<br /><br />The fulfillment of his goal is anti-climactic as with all  objects pursued solely for possession and display. The empheral joy of possession is replaced with the enduring meaninglessness of his life and the eventual ignomy of losing Daisy.<br /><br />The end of the story shows the illusion of Gatsby, a young wealthy eccentric enigmatic gentleman, dissipated by the reality of Gatsby, a hollow common criminal consumed by the desire for a used mindless woman.<br /><br />With the contemporary obssession with materialism, in the form of youth, beauty and wealth, to the exclusion of all else the book is more relevant today than it was then.	2005-08-01

We are forced to take part in his stories, filling in details from our own experiences, making the story unique from each individual's perspective. <br /> <br />The heart of darkness is a comment on the darkness of man's soul symbolized by the descent into a foreboding thick jungle.  <br /> <br />The story is rich with alternating sequences of light/ dark and clarity/ambiguity creating a mood of mystery and uncertainty which never leaves you. <br /> <br />The story has several narrators creating a bewildering effect perhaps to symbolize our own inner struggle with existence and it's meaning. <br /> <br />We are introduced to Marlowe, one of the narrators, and indirectly told about Kurtz, a legendary ivory trader. <br /> <br />As Marlowe enters the depths of the jungle in hopes of meeting Kurtz, Marlowe undergoes a psychological transformation as civilization is stripped around him. We see how man reverts to his true inner state when material possessions, titles and other superficialities are removed. This is highlighted when we finally meet Kurtz who turns out to be a hollow sickly figure physically and morally despite his accolades. This is contrasted with Marlowe, who possess some depth of character, and survives the ordeal albeit a changed man. <br /> <br />Succinctly, the story presages a modern tenet of psychology which states that relocating physically does little to improve your mental state since the latter is taken with you. In fact, it may exacerbate the situation when all social norms are discarded unbridling your deepest darkest desires. <br /> <br />Conrad also uses the story to comment on materialism and it's corrupting influence on one's soul replacing character development with material acquisition. This is symbolized by describing London as the land of the living dead.<br /> <br />A fantastic compact psychological thriller we all can relate to.	2005-07-31

The irony is striking.<br /><br />Humanity is personified in the Lilliputians who are small, weak, corrupt, cruel and proud even in the presence of the giant, Gulliver. Here Swift also draws parallels to  political strife in England and he is especially scathing of PM Walpole who is embodied in the character Flimnap.<br /><br />In the second book, Swift, reverses the role of Gulliver who is now diminutive. This sudden shift is a literary tactic which enables us to understand just how frail humanity is and the gulf between what we are ( Lilliputian ) and what we aspire to be ( Brobdignagian ).<br /><br />Swift uses the opportunity to show that with great power there is great responsibility which must be distributed justly. These qualities are what truly elevate humanity and are exemplified in the Brobdignagian King. We see that in the land of giants, a people free of pride, there is unity and peace free from corruption.<br /><br />The third books is a collection of tales poorly conceived yet powerful enough to yet again empasize man's pride as his downfall. This time it is in the form of Laputians who represent a parody on the notion that rationality alone is the  means to our salvation.<br /><br />In the final book we see man compared to the idealized Houyhynhynms and the bestial and odious Yahoo's. This literary chiaroscuro shows what humanity is and will become when completely devoid of rationality and civility, a brute, juxtaposed with what potential humanity has to become.<br/><br />Of course we are not on either extreme but somewhere in the middle. Gulliver's fails to realize this and sits as a judge on humanity thereby becoming what he despises the most.	2005-07-31

Students will need a flare for the abstract in tackling the contents of the book. <br />It is not suggested for applied sciences such as engineering or the faint of heart. <br /> <br />However, for those wishing an introduction to differential manifolds at a basic level the book is recommended. <br /> <br />Spivak recasts notions of differentiability and integration in a more general setting still in Rn ( limits continuity higher dimensional derivatives measure theory partitions of unity etc) and then introduces the concepts of forms and tensors and associated properties and operations. He now gets to the good stuff by introducing manifolds ( structures with patches that look locally like Rn and are sewed together the right way ) and applying the more abstract theory developed earlier to these structures. One learns how to integrate forms on manifolds. <br /> <br />Stokes theorem is the result. Some other useful ideas like orientation are introduced as well. <br /> <br />A very nice compact book useful for time immemorial.	2005-07-13

No pun intended. <br /> <br />It has a good introductory section on the symptoms of neurological conditions. <br /> <br />However, it fails to provide the reader with an approach to diagnosis which is a pitfall for most clerks, interns and neurology and internal medicine residents. <br /> <br />Remember always ask yourself WHERE is lesion ( brain spinal cord nerve NM junction or muscle ) and WHAT is lesion ( pathological process with respective differential diagnosis ). <br /> <br />This book fails to do this which is inconceivable. <br /> <br />As a reference it falls on more than occasion. The sections are incomplete and not comprehensive. <br /> <br />There is little on entrapment neuropathy or spinal root problems. <br /> <br />I do NOT recommend this text to any medical students ( get lindsay/bone/callender text on neurology and neurosurgery ). <br /> <br />Neurology and medical residents should get a subscription to medlink neurology and not waste their time or money on the text.	2005-07-12

If you are looking for abstraction with little in the way of intuition I suggest Conlan \\" differential manifolds\\" <br /> <br />If you are an applied mathematician or physicist this book is for you. <br /> <br />I have always beleived that to truly grasp mathematics one must be provided with a reason for WHY things are the way they are and WHAT IDEAS the expression must express. This is best done with examples and exercises. <br /> <br />I digress. <br /> <br />The book restricts is exposition to two and three dimensions. Some of the topics can readily be bootstrapped to higher dimensions. <br /> <br />The book starts with basic ideas of curve, directional derivative and tangent vector in Euclidean space with a sprinkling of differential forms to wet the appetite. <br /> <br />It then moves into the notion of frame fields along curves resulting in the Frenet formulas which express how the frame fields change along the curve. These are expressed in terms of the frame field themselves giving ideas of curvature and torsion. <br /> <br />The book then abstracts these concepts to show how we can talk about change of frame fields along arbritrary directions not just along the curve. The tools used to do this are the covariant derivative and connection forms which can then be used to develop connection equations ( abstracted analogue of frenet formulas ) and then the cartan structural equations. <br /> <br />The book talks about isometries and defines euclidean geometry as those properties preserved by isometries. It then abstracts once again to surfaces in R3 using patches and appropriate conditions on the overlap without introducing manifolds although these are briefly mentioned later. <br /> <br />We then see how calculus in euclidean space can be adapted to surfaces using these patches. The corresponding concepts of function, differentiability and tangent vectors on these objects is introduced. Forms on these surfaces are introduced and their application to integrationtheory on these surfaces is developed showing how forms on the surface are \\" pulled back\\" to euclidean space using the idea of differential of a map and integrated there. The integration gives the volume ( area ) of that surface. Stokes theorem is introduced. <br /> <br />We now move into the idea of shape operators on the surface and show how these describe how the normal vector on the surface move in various directions giving ideas of mean and gaussian curvature . We see a very nice interplay of algebraic analysis leading to a geometric analysis. <br /> <br />The book then deals with studying geometrical properties on surfaces using the Cartan methods described earlier. <br /> <br />We then see how to define intrinsic geometry of any surface. Namely those properties of the surface that are preserved by isometries. From the definition of isometry we see that these rely on on the concepts of tangent vector and inner products. Shape operators and mean curvature are not intrinsic. <br /> <br />We now study the geometry of surfaces specifically the intrinsic geometry without reference to an imbedding space ( R3). An abstract \\"surface\\" is endowed with an inner product. A different inner product gives a different geometry. We talk about gaussian curvature and covariant derivative which are intrinsic. <br /> <br />Geodesics are introduced as is the gauss bonnet theorem which relates a geometric property to a topological one. <br /> <br />The book concludes with a chapter on global properties ( 2 d surfaces ) especially how gaussian curvature influences geodesics and how the two completely determine the geometry of the surface.	2005-07-10

As a result each individual is incapable of sustaining his basic needs and thus must purchase these using his labour which Smith views as the source of all value. As a result demand and supply is created for such labour.<br /><br />He makes the natural assumption that each individual pursues their best interests.<br /><br />He foreshadows the concepts of marginal utility and scarcity in determining the shapes of demand curves for commodities. ( He never actually mentions curves ).<br /><br />Similarly, he describes the three factors determining supply prices for commodities ( rent of land, wages and capital costs ) and the various factors which influence them ( the equivalent of modern supply/demand curves for each factor ).<br /><br />He puts these together under ideal circumstances to show how supply and demand meet to clear markets ( equilibrium in modern language ).<br /><br />He then turns to macroeconomics laying the foundations for GDP and shows how capital can be distributed to \\"unproductive labour\\" ( that labour used to maintain productive labour ) such as doctors lawyer entertainers etc and \\"productive labour\\" ( that labour used in the manufacture and distribution of raw and finished products ). He explores the consequences of various distribution of each from both the micro and macroeconomic perspective.<br /><br />He concludes by emphasizing the importance of government in providing international and domestic security as well as providing public works and institutions especially education.<br /><br />Naturally this requires state revenue and he devotes almost one entire \\"book\\" to taxes.<br /><br />He delves briefly into political economy especially merchantilism and it's detrimental effects to society at large.<br /><br />A great introduction to modern economics that is often missed in didactic lectures.

The level of mathematical rigour is adequate with appendices as needed. A degree of vector calculus and linear algebra is presumed but more advanced topics in hilbert space, operator theory, dirac notation and tensor products are developed as needed. <br />  <br />However, most importantly the ideas of quantum mechanics and assumptions are explicitly stated, in fact listed which was refreshing. Often introductory texts fail to bring together all the assumptions and then derive the theory leaving one bewildered. This probably has much to do with the history of quantum mechanics rather than poor literary skills. Regardless it was nice to see and much appreciated. <br /> <br />The problems range from very easy to difficult but solvable with some effort and thought. Most importantly the problems highlight important ideas and basic calculations which serve as models to approach more difficult problems. <br /> <br />The books cannot be read as novels and I suggest completing or at least attempting all the problems if you wish to have a solid understanding of nonrelativitic quantum mechanics. <br /> <br />After reading the book and solving the problems you should be able to state the assumptions of quantum mechanics with experimental proof for such and be fluent in it's mathematical foundations. Consequently, you should be able to approach a solution to most problems encountered in introductory quantum mechanics.  <br /> <br />For example you should be able to quantize the appropriate classical quantity ( energy for example in the case of the harmonic oscillator ), find it's eigenvalues and eigenstates and corresponding wave equations ( where appropriate ) and then derive the mean values for various quantities and derive their time evolution etc etc. <br /> <br />I found the book indispensable for further personal study in quantum field theory and a very useful reference for refreshing forgotten ideas. <br /> <br />For those of you with no physics background, like myself, I suggest reading Fenymann lectures in physics vol 1-3 for a brief non-technical overview of the IDEAS of physics. I then suggest reading intro to mechanics by kleppner ( do all the problems ) and then electromagnetism by purcell ( do all the problems ). You should then delve into quantum mechanics ( you may wish to brush up on wave mechanics as well ). <br /> <br />For those of you who disdain mathematics there are a number of quantum mechanics books \\" for the masses\\" you can read but none will give a grasp of the topic. You must overcome your fear and learn the basic ideas of mathematics.  <br /> <br />The difference is between seeing the sunset and having one described to you.	2005-07-06

A true understanding of physics requires not only the ideas of physics but how these ideas are formulated in mathematical terminology and most importantly it's applications. <br /> <br />This text is for the beginner in physics or the physics buff like myself who has no background in the field. <br /> <br />Starting with basic principles, and presupposing highschool math only, the author begins with a study of linear motion in the form of Newton's law reformulating them into the concept of momentum and eventually the work energy theorem and conservation of energy laws. He then adds the complication of extended bodies and center of mass concepts. Rotation is duly added and the appropriate rotational analogs of angular momentum and torque are introduced in an intuitive yet mathematical format using simple vector operations. He starts with fixed axis rotation and then adds linear motion and then considers non-fixed axis rotation adding some tensor concepts as he goes. <br /> <br />Nice examples of fictitious forces are added in non-inertial reference frames concluding with a chapter on special relativity. <br /> <br />A very well written concise and easy to understand intoduction to mechanics.

He then shows that unlike electricity the net flux of the magnetic field is zero and expresses it in differential form ( maxwells third equation ).  By now you should know he is going to talk about line integrals as with electricity and shows that this is proportional to the current enclosed by the path ( static version of maxwell equation ) <br /> <br />A nice digression on AC currents is explored and he then introduces induction as a prerequisite for modifying maxwells equations. <br /> <br />He then shows that something is wrong with 2 of the equations above by showing that conservation of electric charge ( written in differential form ) leads to a contradiction in the above equations. He then shows how \\"adding\\" the term from the induction phenomena completes maxwells equations in a vacuum. <br /> <br />A solution to maxwells equations is found resulting in the electromagnetic wave we hear so much about. <br /> <br />The text concludes with chapters on electric and magnetic fields in matter. <br /> <br />There is also a nice intro to special relativity. <br /> <br />As with any text to gain understanding you must attempt a majority of the problems which range from very easy to interesting. <br /> <br />A definite must for any physics buff. <br />	2005-07-06

The body of scientific literature suggests that stretching before a workout is actually detrimental and he is astute in pointing this out.<br /><br />Some have argued that he does not provide sport specific routines, however, if you read carefully he points you to the correct chapters based upon your interests and allows you to decide which routines would be best for your interests. For example a martial artist who does alot of kicking would want to focus on lower body stretches whereas a wrestler would want to spend some time on upper body flexibility.<br /><br />In other words he wants you to think about what your goals are and use the routines accordingly.
