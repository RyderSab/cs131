This was just the kind of romance novel I love. Wonderful characters. Characters that seem real because they are not perfect-something most novels like this lack. There are interesting plot twists and we get to know several secondary characters well. The secondary characters are not boring. The chemistry between Brianna and Michael was very sensual and immediate. The heroine is the perfect foil for the hero's cynicism and intellect. It was written with an amazing level of intensity and feeling that my heart was pumping furiously with both the palatable passion and the keen sense of danger infused in the story. Brianna and Michael were both wounded, intriguing, complex, wonderful characters. The action/suspense was fast-paced and thrilling. The setting was beautiful and exotic. The sex was HOT and perfect for the story. Melody Thomas stories are humorous, romantic and interesting - and she is excellent and creating characters that are real, interesting people - and that you remember vividly from book to book throughout the series. You want to know them better! I love the Donally family. This is the second book I have read from Melody Thomas and I love them both. I'm looking forward to reading more about the Donally family. All I can say in conclusion is if you like a good, emotional, heart-tugging historical, with characters that leap off the pages, buy  Must Have Been The Moonlight.	2005-10-14

His Lady Mistress starts off slow. It wasn't a real intense book but it was very enjoyable. I loved Verity. She had a very hard life. Her father took his life.  Max helps her (she was only 15 at the time) Max thinks Verity will be talking care by her uncle. So he leaves her.<br /><br />When the story picks up again. 5 years later Max comes to check up on her. He's told Verity killed herself by her uncle. He sees what he thinks is a servant being abused by the son. Max comes to her recue. I don't want to go into to much detail but Max asks Verity mistress. Then he finds out she is her friends daughter and thinks he's been trick into marriage. He demands she marry him and then the story truely begins. Max can be the rudest most crude man and then other times he is the sweetest man ever. You learn way Max is the way he is near the end of the book and truely understand him and like him. Verity is bright, capable, compassionate, strong and very womanly. She is a woman to admire. The love scenes are ample & steamy, and the plot is a fair one. From page one the characters in this book reached out and grabbed me. This book had its good moments and some flashes of good writing, but I kept thinking, while I was reading it, how much better it could have been. The characters had a lot going for them, but the plot & its resolution just didn't jell into a really good read.<br /><br />His Lady Mistress is a formula romance but as far as formula romance this one is really pretty good.	2005-10-10

The drama that unfolds between the hero, Phillip, and the heroine, Eloise, is emotional, believable, and very well written. This isn't my favorite book of Julia Quinn but it still is wonderful. The author has a great gift in her ability to develop characters. This was another terrific romance from an author who has the ability to break down her characters souls and feed their emotional struggles onto the pages. I absolutely couldn't put the book down until I was finished. The reader will feel the despair, the heartbreak, passion and the joy of Philip and Eloise in this very excellent character driven romance. I must say that the last quarter of the book was quite emotional, poignant and romantic. I even shed a few tears!	2005-10-09

Kell so call rescues Raven from his brother. I really don't see at that way. Kell doesn't give Raven back to her family right away. Kell's brother drugs Raven with aphrodisiac. Kell takes advantage of her. To relieve her of her sexual desires he fingers her and more. To take advandage of a girl when she is drugged is sick. I kept thinking it was like those men you drug girls with that date night drug and rape them. It's NOT SEXY. His excuse is lame at best. He claimed that it would be torture if he didn't relieve her of sexual desires. That she would go nuts and try to have sex with any man she would see. 1st I don't know of any aphrodisiac this strong. 2nd Don't tell me he couldn't have her lock in a room alone until the drug wear off. He is a total jerk after she wakes up and really rude to her. He treats her like it it was her fault that she was drugged by his brother. I couldn't read after chapter 4 Completely tasteless<br /><br />I will NEVER read Nicole Jordan again. What a waste of money.	2005-10-07

It drags on and on. It took me a week and a half to finish it. It usably read a book in 2 to 3 days. I really didn't like Princess Tatiana and really couldn't see what Matt saw in her expect for lust. They really didn't have much in common. She was bitchy to him when he brought up any of her past bad behavior or her lies. I would have like to slap her. Matt took her back rather quick after she treated him badly. As for the mystery and plot twists I like a good mystery and plot twists in my books romance or other wise but I need more romance than this book gave. I need to believe the hero and heroine belong together to enjoy a book. The hero is wonderful but that wasn't enough to hold this book together.<br /><br />Try When We Meet Again by Victoria Alexander it a much better written book.	2005-10-05

I'm really looking forward to the next book in the series.<br /><br />Thea is my kinda girl - outspoken, unafraid to speak her piece, even if it's not the most popular opinion, and willing to take care of herself. She doesn't need a man to protect her. Her relatives have already taught her all she needs to know, maybe even more than they realized. But she eventually finds out that a girl sometimes needs a man, for reasons other than protection. And she finds out that even tough girls like her, need a little tender care.	2005-10-02

This was a fine effort on the part of this author and I highly applaud it this book and sincerely recommend it to any and all. One of the things I liked best about this book is the way the author wove the emotional storyline with such a light touch -- I was engrossed with the relationship between the hero and heroine and truly felt as if I knew them both.

Benedict and Sophie are such dynamic characters in their own right that it's only a matter of time before the sparks fly. If you long to be swept into the lives of two enchanting people, I highly recommend this one. This book had everything you need to create a good romance: a dashing hero, a beautiful heroine, a person who always seems to interfere with the hero and heroine, and most of all...PASSION! From page one the characters in this charming book reached out and grabbed me. Page after page I just got sucked in deeper until I closed the book with a happy sigh.<br /><br />The plot moved along at a great pace. Full of enjoyable supporting characters and stories. An Offer From a Gentleman was an emotional roller coaster, and I felt all the pain and joy they did. It was written with an amazing level of intensity and feeling that my heart was pumping furiously with the palatable passion in the story. The relationship between the leads is endearing. The secondary characters are enjoyable as well. I was so engrossed, I read it in a day. Wonderfully written! And very sexy historical romance book. An Offer From a Gentleman is a book I know I will be reading for years to come. It's a keeper.	2005-09-14

I can't really explain why it didn't work for me -- which is going to make this a pitiful review.<br /><br />In a princes bed didn't have the same hot sizzling heat as the last to books in this series had To Pleasure a Prince and One Night With a Prince. The drama was so so. Nothing that dazzled me. I found myself bored in scenes without Katherine & Alec. I like the main characters but that was all I liked. It does start picking up the pace around the middle in end but it's still not up to the standard that 2nd and 3rd book have in this series.<br /><br />I really was looking forward to this book and I was sadly disappointed by it. I only finished In the Prince's Bed because I read the other two books in this series. Sad to say but true.	2005-09-12

US	31130822	R2Z3QN8WXUQ31I	0671739727	635712327	Highland Velvet	Books	5	2	3	N	N	GREAT BOOK!	This book had everything you need to create a good romance: a dashing hero, a beautiful heroine, a person who always seems to interfere with the hero and heroine, and, most of all...PASSION! The relationship between the leads is endearing. The secondary characters are enjoyable as well. The interaction between the leads was great. They really enjoyed smarting off to each other because they did not like a lot about each other in the beginning. But their disagreements were often very funny. This was a very entertaining book. This book was a pleasure to read and I couldn't put it down until it was finished. I loved watching Steven and Bronwyn grow as people. And where able to see that there is good and bad in all kinds of people. You can't judge someone for their race but who that are as a person. I know there are a lot of people who didn't like Bronwyn. I really don't understand why. Steven screwed up big time in the beginning coming 3 days late for the wedding. He had not even come to see her before that. Steven was arrogant and disrespectful. Steven changes as he sees Bronwyn as a true and great leader. It took Bronwyn awhile to forgive and trust Steven. Plus Bronwyn was forced to marry Steven after father and three men she was choose from to be her husband. Bronwyn had a lot to get over before she could fall head over heels in love with Steven.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the characters, as they were very likeable.<br /><br />This story was honest about how women were thought of at that time.<br /><br />Some people hate this book. Some people love this book. I'm in the camp that love this book.	2005-09-10

Both the hero and the heroine have secrets of their own, which are slowly brought to light by the author, like layers being peeled from a (very good) onion....<br /><br />Also You need to To Catch an Heiress it's the wonder 1st book to this series.	2005-08-28

I found the characters to be multi-dimensional and the author weaves a mystery into the story without slowing it down or interrupting the romantic flow. I loved that were too lost souls who found each other. They healed each others wounds. Marcus is handsome, sexy, intelligent, but embittered by life. I am always a sucker for stories with \\"heartless\\" heroes who find their souls through the love of a good woman. The dialogue that ensues between Marus and Regina is just fast paced and very enjoyable. The plot and characters seemed fresh, the pace was quick, and it was a totally engrossing read. This was an awfully good and original read! It was written with an amazing level of intensity and feeling that my heart was pumping furiously with palatable passion. This was just the kind of romance novel I love. Wonderful characters. Characters that seems real because they are not perfect-something most novels like this lack. I absolutely loved this book.

The reader will feel the despair, the heartbreak, passion and the joy of Gareth and Hyacinth in this very excellent character driven romance. Gareth and Hyacinth were both wounded, intriguing, complex, wonderful characters. The action/suspense was fast-paced and thrilling. The setting was beautiful and exotic.

I was bored through the first half. I really didn't like Miranda Cameron. She was wishy washy, crabby and self centered. She didn't go with Alex after he was whipped and almost didn't die for her 10 yrs early. I just wanted to slap her. She was such a female dog to Alex when they meet again. Telling everyone he was part Indian and having people turn against him. And it was Just to be spiteful. I didn't like Miranda sisters pushing her to marry for a title and money.<br /><br />The second part of the book it picked up the pace but I want to slap Alex. He screwed up BIG time. He kidnaps Miranda and has sex with her. Miranda gets sick. She nearly dies. She talks in her sickness saying White White White.  Alex thinks she talking about needing a white man. So he leaves her with his family in England. Then Alex refuses to see Miranda and telling his brother to marry off to any man rich man with a title. Miranda wants to see him and tell him she loves him but he doesn't see her until the Duke wants Miranda. He screwed everyone by doing that Alex's friends & Miranda's sister's. The duke is a VERY powerful man and gets revenge for Miranda backing out of the wedding. I really liked the Duke (the annother man in this story.) I felt really sorry for him. He got shafted the biggest in this book.<br /><br />I HATED Lady Overstreet. Lady Overstreet job in the begining of the books was to help Miranda find a rich and titled husband. Lady Overstreet was a hustler and I really couldn't see why the heck she was back with Miranda at the end of the book. Miranda now had Alex's brother and sister in law to help. Lady Overstreet was unless in helping Miranda so why was she there. She was a HORRIBLE person.<br /><br />I don't know about you but I want to at least like the hero and heroine. I JUST couldn't in this book. I don't like feeling sorry for the so called villain of the story. I felt empty at the end of this book. I don't know what this author was going for but it didn't work for me. Don't waste your money on this book. I will not be reading the next books in this series because I really could care less about Miranda's sisters.didn't work for me. Don't waste your money on this book.

One of the things I liked best about this book is the way the author wove the emotional storyline with such a light touch -- I was engrossed with the relationship between the hero and heroine and truly felt as if I knew them both. The Maiden was an emotional roller coaster, and I felt all the pain and joy they did. I was so engrossed, I read it in a day. The love scenes are ample & steamy, and the plot is a good one. A fast paced book with an intricate plot that I cannot help but enjoy. The Maiden has a strong heroine who is in no way ordinary, a back story which is compelling but doesn't get in the way of the love story, and of course a wonderful hero. This a must read!<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book. The author has a great gift in her ability to develop characters. I must have laughed a hundred times and I absolutely couldn't put the book down until I was finished.	2005-07-13

In the awaking Hank Montgomery of rescues Amanda from a life were she is being controled by her father & husband to be and shows  her what passion is. He helps her become the woman she was meant to be. You need to read the Princess to see how free she becomes. I love this book. I love the background characters as well.<br /><br />Jude Deveraux developed Amanda and Hank's personalities and motivations very convincingly, to the point where you feel as though you know them well enough to be friends by the time you finish the book.

I love that this book is connected to both the awaking and a knight in shining armor. Both J.T. Montgomery and Hank Montgomery fall in love with uptight women. In the The Princess  J.T. Montgomery rescues spoiled Aria and shows what passion is. He helps her become the woman she was meant to be. The reader will feel the despair, the heartbreak, passion and the joy of Hank and Aria in this very excellent character driven romance. I found the characters to be multi-dimensional and the author weaves a mystery into the story without slowing it down or interrupting the romantic flow. The plot and characters seemed fresh, the pace was quick, and it was a totally engrossing read. Full of enjoyable supporting characters and stories. This was just the kind of romance novel I love. Wonderful characters. Characters that seems real because they are not perfect-something most novels like this lack.<br /><br />Jude Deveraux developed Aria and J.T.

It petered out and could have been better done. Douglas went back to get Nicholas soul. Not believeable. I love the beginning and middle of the book. I loved Nicholas and Douglas and how they fall in love. I love that you learn how many kids J.T. Montgomery & Aria from thee Princess and that they are very happy. But the ending of this book was VERY sappy. I would of like a ton better if  Douglas went back in time so her soul mate could be born. Douglas saved Nicholas' son from dying as a baby. Having it be that Nicholas soul in is Nicholas heir was just stupid. And That because Douglas was kind to her ex boyfriend and his daughter in the pasted life made them kinder to her in the present was lame. What did she do in the past before that made them so rude to her now. It just wasn't believeable.	2005-07-08

This book is the first of the Montgomery clan where it all started! If you love the Montgomery's like I do then this is a must have for you,such a classic!!! I love how Jude Deveraux tells the story of the pain of Ranulf De Warbrooke who was deeply hurt by his first wife and how true love was able to heal that pain.  Ranulf is handsome, sexy, intelligent, but embittered by life. I am always a sucker for stories with \\"heartless\\" heroes who find their souls through the love of a good woman. The dialogue that ensues between Ranulf and Lyonene is just fast paced and very enjoyable. The plot and characters seemed fresh, the pace was quick, and it was a totally engrossing read. It was written with an amazing level of intensity and feeling that my heart was pumping furiously with palatable passion. This book has lots of drama and the  characters are colorful and unforgettable. The reader will feel the despair, the heartbreak, passion and the joy of  Ranulf De Warbrooke and Lyonene in this very excellent character driven romance.<br /><br />This book is a MOST if you have read Velvet Song. A truly remarkable book that is a must read for any fan of Jude Deveraux or any fan historical romance.	2005-07-08

This series is Jude at her best. I believe this is my favorite. I love that the lady's man of the brothers falls in love with a woman that curses like a sailor. LOL The series is a must. I love seeing the sister in laws getting together to save Miles.<br /><br />Page after page I just got sucked in deeper until I closed the book with a happy sigh. This book had everything you need to create a good romance: a dashing hero, a beautiful feisty heroine, someone who always seems to interfere with the hero and heroine, and, most of all...PASSION! It was written with an amazing level of intensity and feeling that my heart was pumping furiously with the palatable passion in the story. This book is sharp and fast-moving. Filled with Lovable and exciting characters. This was a very entertaining book. This book was a pleasure to read and I couldn't put it down until it was finished. Jude Deveraux has found a perfect match for the notorious Miles Montgomery  with feisty Elizabeth Chatworth. They are well matched in temperament, intelligence and in their loyalty to their families. It was an interesting. There is enough conflict to make the story line interesting and not so much that your left wondering why they ever got together.	2005-07-08
