It's not that the story itself is so very unusual - reminds me a little of *Them* by Joyce Carol Oates or with her clipped, terse sentences, Williams is somewhat like a female Hemmingway, but after reading this book, as well as a short story by Theresa Williams called \\"Blue Velvis\\" published in *The Sun Magazine*, I guarantee that you could hand me a pile of manuscripts, all by different unnamed authors, and after reading them, I could pick out hers as soon as I got to it.  She's that unusual.  I mean, as my 8th grade English teacher used to say, she has a \\"voice.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"I like to be able to reach out and feel life's edges,\\" says Pearl, (the main character), and that's what this book does - plumbs the edges.  The whole narrative is a dialogue with Pearl's unborn daughter (Pearl just KNOWS her child will be female). <br /> <br />The voice of Pearl Starling, is authentic and unique.  Pearl would be dubbed \\"trailer trash\\" by many in our society and she knows it, but she doesn't let that kill her soul.  She is, as Shakespeare mused, - \\"a lady more sinned against than sinning.\\"  Her narrative isn't a litany of sins against her, however; they're only noted.  What she went through changed, shaped and informed her life - but that's all.  She hasn't been snuffed out mentally, physically or emotionally.  Her pregnancy at the age of 45 is a personal triumph and source of delight for her, and she especially relishes the unsatisfied curiosity of her neighbors as to the identity of the father of her child. <br /> <br />The Pentecostals tried to pry the info out of her in the guise of a witnessing call.  Pearl had been involved with them when she was 16 and suddenly alone in the world but for an abusive father and a next-door neighbor, father of three daughters in her age range, who gave her guidance and attention when she needed it. <br /> <br />In Pearl's memory, a woman of the Pentecostals that she already knew, \\"...put her hand on my back, raised her other hand, tilted her face heavenward.  The old man touched my shoulder and prayed in tongues, that obscure language.  I stayed, let them beseach, but told myself, `After this, no more of this touching.'  I felt no comfort in it.  Just a vast emptiness.  Like the daytime sky was inside me.  Limitless.  Blank.  `Just leave me,' I was thinking.  `Leave me to this vacancy'\\". <br /> <br />Talking to this unborn daughter, she tells her that \\"One night, not long ago, I dreamed about your birth.  You were a red moon slipped out from some dark corner of the sky.  A real piece of sky I could hold.  It made me want to forgive the sky.  For both its calm betrayal and for its frightful storms.  My dream made me want to forgive the sky.  A little.  `That's right,' I said, `Drink it in.  Your life.  The air.  Use your own mouth to tell the world what you want.' \\" <br /> <br />Why does she need to forgive the sky, you may wonder?  Read the book and find out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-12
US	49869538	R21S7S4389X663	0826333958	160493119	New Buffalo: Journals from a Taos Commune (Counterculture Series)	Books	5	24	25	N	N	Threads of Gold	This book is unique.  It is like nothing else you are likely to read.  There are incidents, anecdotes, and life situations that have much in common with other chronicles of the times, most especially, *Scrapbook of a Taos Hippie* by Iris Keltz.  Indeed, the latter work makes a splendid companion volume to this one because it mentions many of the same people, places and events of the time.  Does it with engaging interviews and an overvoice that glues it all together. <br /> <br />Arthur Kopecky's faithful recording of life at the New Buffalo commune from 1971 to 1976, however, is unique in that it is a true journal with the energy and immediacy of real-time events. <br /> <br />The commune itself is the narrative voice.  During the times when Kopecky left to visit other communes or to go hunting with other communards or to bring his own mother from New York, other people took up the journal and filled in the gaps of day-to-day existence on the scene.  Sometimes they left their names, sometimes not.  Sometimes they agreed with Arty (or An Swei as he called himself then), and sometimes they struck chords of dissent and argument.  But it's all here. <br /> <br />Here you will find accounts of making adobe bricks to add on more rooms to the pueblo, accounts of their problems and successes with their many farm animals - cows, pigs, chickens, goats, mules - their craft activity to make money on the side - jewelry-making, candle-making, weaving, carpentry, bee-keeping, cooking, canning, drying, storing and harvesting their crops, stories of their wild parties with music and dancing, chronicles of the peyote meetings at and around Buffalo, accounts of cooperating with locals for their water rights for irrigation, their relationship with other communes in the area (Morningstar, Reality, Lama, Five Star) their struggles with taxes and with making New Buffalo a legal corporation (finally successful), diaries of their children and home birthing, their famous hospitality to so many visitors from all over this country and other countries, their problems with outdated machinery and vehicles.  All this and still there are introspective passages about their lives, the war in Viet Nam, and their marriages, love affairs, births, and deaths. <br /> <br />Various entries speak for themselves of the life and flavor of New Buffalo. <br /> <br />\\"We got a refrigerator out of the dump for a smoke house.  Pepe taught me to cut a hole in the bottom, connect with stovepipe to a covered fruit wood fire twelve feet away.  This provides cold smoke for best taste.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Larry started hooking up the new hot water tank to run off the wood cook stove.  He worked all day on it.  The thirty-gallon tank sits behind the firebox, the smoke goes where the insulation used to be, and a water pipe goes right in the fire and back out.  If you were on a colony spaceship, you'd want this guy with you.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Full moon.  Wild party here started in the afternoon.  Mick butchered five chickens.  Jason from the Hog Farm helped do the cooking. We had cars, trucks, longhaired hippies, dark-skinned gypsies and big-chested, long-legged dancing girls getting it on in the front yard.  Guitars, a banjo, three or four drums, a saxophone, a clarinet, and perhaps 80 people here.  Fire in the courtyard at night.  Joseph Cruz from the Pueblo came with Phil, Joe, Henry and Benjamin, all local Indians.  They sing really fine.  I went to bed early in the moonlight, under a cedar tree on the hill, listening to their ancient songs.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Yesterday we stepped into a Van Gogh painting and cut the golden wheat field.  Five sickles and two stackers worked much of the day.  Incredibly beautiful.  Also weeded and watered the cornfield.  We have a pretty good harvest.\\" <br /> <br />\\"County Fair tomorrow!  Carol baked coffeecakes for the contest, and she's really got a chance to produce the best.  Kim is bringing fresh carrots, beets, onions, yellow squash, and lettuce.  He isalready putting carrots away - colors so lush in the humid air - beautiful produce.  John intends to enter cheese, butter and maybe some goats.\\" <br /> <br />\\"This mudding we can do.  Old way good way.  Basically grab a handful with the straw and some sand mixed in, and slap it on the wall.  Next smooth it out a bit.  To keep the clothes clean, it's best to take them off.\\" <br /> <br />\\"We live in such abundance.  A bunch of poor people, we are still able to scrape up what we need to patch and glue this scene together.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Recommended: Don't store the apples and rutabagas in the same cellar.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Mercy mission to Lama; they have some sick ones.  We gave them a five-pound cheese, elk meat, candles...\\" <br /> <br />\\"The huge teepee is up and the floor is covered with sheepskins, blankets and rugs.  Tonight we go in to pray for a good spring and for this place.  New buffalo was started with a peyote meeting. The ceremony joins the spirit of the new arrivals and the Indians, and gives thanks to mother earth, father sky and Jesus, for our life.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The commune is a natural alternative to the lifestyle of consumption.  I've still got a notion in the back of my head that this may play a role in the future of this country's economics.  With roots in the soil, with people being close to some essentials, there would be less insecurity about the often-slipping number of jobs.  With more working people not so dependent on the jobs offered by the big corporations, we would perhaps be able to depose those people who guide our economy into such conspicuous consumption.\\" <br /> <br />Even though New Buffalo is no longer a commune, its legacy and vision continue. In my experience, it takes a long time to read a journal.  It's different from a story, since there's no narrative thread per se.  But the time is well worth it.  The threads you do find are of solid gold. <br />	2004-09-01

He includes a quote from Hermann Goering, president of the Reichstag, Nazi Party, and the Luftwaffe Commander in Chief that has been making the rounds on the internet ever since the events of 9/11.<br />\\"Naturally the common people don't want war.  Neither in Russa, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany.  That is understood.  But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship.  Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.  That is easy.  All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.  It works the same in any country.\\"<br />Watson chronicles the history of this practice, from the Romans, through both our World Wars, our first Pearl Habor, Operation Northwoods and on in an attempt to install police state conditions all over the world and to establish a New World Order of repression and control of all peoples.<br />The author details all the evidence of our government's complicity in ordering the air force to stand down on September 11, 2001 and on that day only, how the Bush Administration protected the terrorists (letting them into our flight schools, issuing them visas, allowing them to leave and enter the country at will), the cover-up of evidence of the demolition of the towers, the lack of evidence that a 757 had flown into the Pentagon (there were no bodies, no 757 debris, the hole made was much smaller than a 757, and there were witnesses who claimed that what they saw was a military aircraft).  The refusal of the Administration to relinquish tapes, transponder recordings, recordings of calls they claimed were made from the hijacked planes - all in the name of national security - obviates the official story.  If they have nothing to hide, why are they hiding it?<br />A major smoking gun was the \\"fireman's video.\\"  Two French filmmakers, who were making a documentary about the New York Fire Service were in New York on September 11 and they filmed the first crash into the North Tower (supposedly American Airlines Flight 11).  This video was shown on all the networks, and if you slow down the footage, frame by frame, you can see that not only is the aircraft not a 757 but that a missile is fired from it a split second before it hits the tower.  Says this author, \\"The true Flights 11, 175, 77 and 93 were indeed substituted with other planes when the transponders were switched off.  Someone hijacked the hijackers to make sure the job was done properly.\\"<br />Among the countries that warned that an attack was immanent (including specific information of the intention to fly planes into the world trade center) were Italy, Britain, the Philippines, Germany, Israel, France, Egypt, Russia, Afghanistan and the Sudan.<br />President George W. Bush threatened FBI agents with arrest if they didn't cease investigation of Al-Qaeda two months prior to September 11.  A secret FBI document, 1991 WF213589, was leaked by disgruntled FBI agents.  It details how the FBI were ordered to discontinue investigation into members of the bin Laden family and WAMY (World Association of Muslim Youth) even though both networks had direct links to terrorism. <br />The book also reports on how the Bush Administration has benefited financially from this war.  Cheney's Halburton (that had contracts on Iraq BEFORE 9/11) have made hundreds of billions of dollars already. <br />The LA Times reported on November 2002 on P20G, the Proactive Pre-emptive Operations Group that was set up to \\"launch secret operations aimed at stimulating reactions\\" among terrorists and states possessing weapons of mass destruction.\\"  Journalist Chris Floyd, outraged by P20G, said, \\"Let's say this plainly, clearly and soberly, so that no one can mistake the intention of Rumsfeld's plan - the United States government is planning to use `cover and deception' and secret military operations to provoke murderous terrorist attacks on innocent people.  Let's say it again: Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, George W. Bush, and the other members of the unelected regime in Washington plan to deliberately foment the murder of innocent people - your family, your friends, your lovers, you - in order to further their geopolitical ambitions. They will plot \\"imaginary terror attacks' on the U.S. and then thwart them, \\"...reassuring you that they will protect you by taking your rights away.\\"<br />I had only a couple nit picking problems with this book.  It's annoying that there's no index and there are grammatical errors (confusion of \\"affect\\" and \\"effect\\", use of the possessive for a simple plural, but alas, this seems to be rampant in American letters of late).  These are piddly problems compared to the main thrust of this work, which is to warn the American people that we are being vastly lied to and manipulated.  All the facts are documented in this book.  Ignore them at your own peril.  Read it.	2004-06-17
US	49869538	R30HDCAZ0KKFF1	1566565529	462605189	The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration and 9/11	Books	5	31	37	N	N	Makes Watergate Look like a Walk in the Park	This is indeed, in my opinion, the book of the century about the crime of the century.  Since other reviewers have pretty well covered the major anomalies in the government's official story compared with the facts of the non-hijackings and the controlled demolitions of the towers, etc., I'll just mention things that particularly reached out and bit me.<br />Griffin reminds us that there are several U.S. precedents for fabricating a pretext for war, \\"...most notoriously for the wars against Mexico Cuba and Vietnam\\" and it is widely known that FDR allowed the original Pearl Harbor strike to happen to get us into WW II, but I'd not known before reading this book about \\"Operation Northwoods.\\"  Seems President Eisenhower asked the CIA to come up with a pretext to invade Cuba.  So they came up with a plan of covert operations \\"...in such a manner as to avoid any appearance of U.S. intervention.\\"  But after the Bay of Pigs \\"fiasco\\", JFK took responsibility for Cuba away from the CIA and assigned it to the Department of Defense.  Kennedy was then given a plan, signed by all the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that described \\"...pretexts which would provide justification for U.S. military intervention in Cuba.\\"  It was important, the memorandum said, \\"to camouflage the ultimate objective.\\"  The plan listed possible scenarios:  \\"We could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area...we could sink a boatload of Cubans en route to Florida (real or simulated)\\" or [says the plan], \\"It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner...\\"  Gosh, doesn't this have a familiar ring to it?  And Operation Northwoods was proposed way back in 1962!  There's more:  \\"An aircraft at Elgin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplication for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area.  At a designated time, the duplication would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases.  The actual registered aircraft would be converted to a drone.\\"  Then the drone and actual aircraft would rendezvous and the passengers evacuated.  \\"When over Cuba, the drone will transmit on the international distress frequency a \\"MAY DAY\\" message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft.  The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal.\\"<br />The above gives me some small hope that the passengers of Flight 77 may still be alive - somewhere.<br />Fortunately, Kennedy rejected Operation Northwoods .  There is also a precedent for this.  A heinous plan to annex Hawaii through subterfuge was rejected by President Grover Cleveland but was accepted by the next president William McKinley (who was also the one who used the Maine incident to justify entering the war against Spain in order to take control of Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines).<br />So if anyone, after reading about these precedents can still say they find it unbelievable that our beloved government could possibly fabricate information which would result in the deaths of innocent people, all I can say is, \\"Stay as sweet as you are.\\"<br />Another thing that jumped out at me was that if there was mere incompetence in the events of 9/11, as our government claims, why were there no reprimands?  Some honest whistleblowers in the FBI, for instance and others who were zealous in pointing out discrepancies (including reporters) subsequently lost their jobs and some died under mysterious circumstances, but those who went with the program and at the very least could rightfully be accused of gross incompetence were not reprimanded, but in many cases promoted.  Why?<br />And the lies - by Bush, by Condoleezza Rice, by Cheney, by Ashcroft - caught redhanded they were - a matter of public record, and the American public doesn't even seem to notice.<br />I believe that we in this country are in the throes of a mass psychosis brought on by an orchestrated fear.  Griffin points out that the Bush Administration has repeatedly stonewalled all attempts at an investigation into 9/11 and Bush insisted on picking the investigators while instructing them to focus on how to prevent a recurrence of the tragedy and not to even look into the causes and participate in the \\"blame game.\\"  We are told that we must move on.<br /> For anybody who still believes that our government was not complicit in the events of 9/11, I challenge you to read this book.  Read all the footnotes.  Check all the facts for yourselves.  Just read it and then tell me:  Is this the crime of the century or what?	2004-04-30
US	49869538	R2OHVRE69E6FH2	0974575003	763710473	The Designer Revolution	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A NEW CANON	From her unique perspective as a high school teacher, Valerie Kirschenbaum has made some stunning discoveries about learning - that children learn much better when teachers use body language, that body language can be brought into writing with color and image which excite different groups of cells in the brain, that emotional arousal amplifies memory, that there is such a thing as visual thinking, and that word and image used simultaneously integrates brain operations and allows the student to come to a higher level of understanding more quickly.  \\"Especially today,\\" says the author, \\"if we don't immediately grab them, we too often lose them.  Colorful visuals are a way of grabbing their attention, arousing their emotions and of sustaining their interest.\\" <br />In researching the subject, Ms. Kirschenbaum discovered, for example, that \\"...the image of a Buddha can trigger the release of hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, causing them to interact with nerves in the body and travel to the brain.  Literally, the image opens the mind and heart of the reader.\\"  And in Tibet, the sight of an image that the viewer perceives as sacred can trigger electrochemical responses in the brain, i.e. readers could SEE concepts.  \\"With the designer word,\\" Valerie maintains, \\"we can transform traditionally verbal techniques into visual techniques.  Rhyme, repetition, metaphor, figures of speech, characterization, tone, simile and symbolism can all be visual.  We can foreshadow, change moods, express irony or sarcasm and allude and alliterate visually.  The possibilities are endless...\\"If we cannot always make this exquisite avalanche of consciousness sayable, then we can at least make it showable.\\"  Amen to that.<br />It's not exactly rocket science to realize that this could be an incredible aid to reading and therefore to learning in our technological society, but as far as I am aware, nobody has connected these particular dots before this particular young woman came on the scene and pointed them out.<br />Before the advent of Gutenberg, Medieval illuminators used ornament and decoration to create \\"multiple simultaneous meanings.\\"  After Gutenberg, when block black-and-white printing became the norm, \\"...writers couldn't synthesize their verbal and visual innovations.  They couldn't write outside the box and think outside the box simultaneously.  They were stuck between word and image, seeing and thinking, left brain and right brain.\\"  And while Medieval denial may have been rooted in religion, our modern denial is rooted in an antiquated technology that insists that black and white blocks of texts are the only proper form for serious scholarship and that images, different fonts and color should be relegated to children's books.<br />As Leonard Shlain observed in his groundbreaking work, *The Alphabet Versus the Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image*, our era is evolving toward a new integration of left and right brain functions with keyboards, computers, TV, movies, etc.  Why cannot that integration be extended to the printed word?<br />This book realizes left and right-brain integration in a most delightful way.  I especially enjoyed the color graphics where Medieval, Greek and Renaissance characters are shown to be writing and on closer inspection, you see that they're using computers.  I would have liked a snappier title for the book but have to admit that upon this writing, I haven't thought of any.<br />\\"First a new theory is attacked as absurd,\\" says William James in *Pragmatism's conception of Truth.*  \\"Then it is admitted to be true but insignificant.  Finally it is seen to be so important that its adversaries claim that they themselves discovered it.\\"  One can only hope that Valerie Kirschenbaum's name will still be remembered long after her thesis has become a new canon. But as she herself admits, in the long run it doesn't matter as long as the new canon is adopted, because \\"...no matter how much I may have blossomed, I could never stand up before other teachers and writers and designers and not invite every one of them to surpass me.\\"<br />\\"We will not join the ranks of the Old Canon.  We will create a new Canon....\\"We will seek the rose in the prose.  We will find the light in delight.\\"  And finally \\"incipit liberi besti\\" -\\"begin beautiful books.\\"  I believe this is an idea whose time has come. Bravo!	2004-03-14

Insert \\"Hammond Guthrie\\" as Zelig in all these places from LA to London, from Amsterdam to Tangier and you'll get an idea of the scope of this memoir.  In reviewing it, the temptation is to reel off lists of the famous people that the author has known.  But one has only to glance at the well-appointed index to see the illustrious names.  The spectrum of his contacts - artists, architects, cartoonists, writers, musicians, film-makers and even scientists - boggles the mind.  He has a talent for schmooozing with people from diverse cultures and persuasions, famous and infamous.  He can be the hipster extraordinaire in L.A, the proper gentleman in London, the cutting edge artiste in Amsterdam, as well as the flamboyant \\"European with two wives\\" in Tangier. His adventures there read like a page from Tennessee Williams' *Suddenly Last Summer* or Lawrence Durrell's *Alexandria Quartet* (but with a more engaging spin). <br />Being all things to all people, he had his finger in every pie and his hand on the pulse of everything artistically innovative in the `60s and early `70s.  In addition to being a painter, writer, musician and film-maker, he experimented with \\"...cinematic dissolve and juxtaposition of genre\\" in his \\"event rituals,\\" tone poems and overdubbed happenings.<br />There are hilarious episodes, from getting a fake marine ID in Mexico to his elaborate and ultimately successful ruse to avoid the draft.  Once he jumped out of a car he'd hitched a ride in when the driver told him it was stolen.  He ditched the \\"supposed narcosi\\" the driver had given him behind the first bush he came to and \\"...to avoid the obvious, I ducked into the darkened courtyard of a quasi-subterranean establishment called the Fifth Estate...\\" where he met some people he would know for the rest of his life.<br />I most enjoyed the odd little serendipitous scenes such as the time when, <BR>still in school, but working for the summer with his high school band buddies at a Lake near Tahoe, Hammond met three Angels who had descended on the town café, much to the perplexity of the waitress who made noises about closing at 9:30 a.m. When a smooth Latin voice intervened on his behalf, Hammond turned around to see \\"...three of the most ominous-looking human beings I had ever laid eyes on.\\"  After inviting them politely (he \\"knew enough to be very polite) to his band's evening at the local lodge, one of them asked Hammond if he \\"...drank beer or smoked dope.\\"  Says Guthrie, \\"I told him I certainly drank beer and had `tripped out on LSD once,\\" but hadn't smoked any dope, which was the truth.  (Never tell an Angel anything but the truth.\\")  His \\"outlaw companions\\" cracked up at this.  Then Hammond's benefactor handed him his \\"senior member of the Hell's Angels\\" club card saying that \\"...it might come in handy some day.\\"  It was signed, \\"Zorro.\\"<br />Two years later, Guthrie saw a news article that identified the three \\"modern-day gladiators\\" that he'd met in his youth.  More years later, flat broke in Barstow, CA \\"...where tumbleweeds go to die...\\" a biker wearing Angel colors roared up and Guthrie's \\"speed-drenched brain\\" remembered Zorro's \\"well-worn wallet card.\\"  He \\"...stumbled up beside the hairy behemoth\\" presented him with the card and asked politely for assistance.  Whereupon, \\"...he sized me up for just a second, smiled as only an Angel from Hell can, and said, \\"Hop on little buddy and I'll take you anywhere in the country you want to go.\\"<br />Or how about the time that Lawrence Ferlinghetti handed him the original hand-written pages of Jack Kerouac's *Scriptures of the Golden Eternity* or when Ginserg handed him a Tibetan Dorje and \\"...a numbing energy surged through my arm and my hand spasmed out in front of me like a humanoid dowser's wand!\\" <br />Guthrie met with William Burroughs in London, who helped in publishing his *Belfast Insert* which was an experiment in \\"cut/up writing.\\"  \\"Cut/up writing\\" explains the author, \\"is an extension of Tristan Tzara's early Dada prose taken to a painter's point of view and then reapplied to the written word.  The resulting texts of combined structure and newly formed contents offer an unusual approach to the written space/time continuum.\\"  (There is a picture of the cover of Belfast Insert in the very interesting photo section of the book). <br />Of Emmett Grogan, Guthrie says:  \\"I was especially enamored by his consciously plagiaristic use of Adolph Hitler's Mein Kamphian Diabologue at the Roundhouse in London, during the \\"Dialectics of Liberation\\" event, a counter-conference of hip dignitaries. At first he was vigorously applauded for his oration and then people cried out in staunch indignation when he revealed the origin of the words.\\"<br />And although Guthrie's heartbreak at the loss of his wife to a drug smuggler was obviously real and excruciating, perhaps the subtext of his reaction was that the event served as an excuse NOT to take the plum of artistic success offered him by Willem Sandberg (his mentor and friend in Amsterdam) and limit himself to painting alone but to remain free and flexible.  <br />All these experiences are liberally laced with copious amounts of pharmacopoeia of every kind from grass and hash to hallucinogens to amphetamines so these pages are compressed life.  Elegant as champagne and caviar, rich as eggnog and cheesecake, the memoir runs cinematic-like reels through the imagination. Since the author's life is not over yet (his book begins and ends with his decision to kill himself) it's fitting that the very last words on the last page are \\"to be continued.\\"  <br />One can only hope that the words mean just that and that in the fullness of time, we will be treated to the rest of the story.  It will be well worth waiting for.	2003-10-27

The best thing about it is the cover picture(taken from *Aquarian Odyssey* by Don Synder).  But its all down hill from there.  The author, it seems, has an agenda.  Hes supposedly showing and telling the nitty gritty of hippie communal life in the 60s and 70s as if it were an historical novel, which it isnt.  Instead, his creation is a condemnatory cartoon from hell - the Zap comix version. The author takes snippets of actual lifestyles and happenings of the period and weaves it into a complete fabrication and caricature, not readily apparent to anyone who has not lived through and participated of the communal life of the era.  Nowhere is there mention of the new social order attempted or the continuation of that social order in hundreds of communes that survive to the present time.<br />Boyle takes the name Drop City from an actual commune in Colorado by that name, famous for its geodesic Buckminster Fuller domes, but this fictional commune is nothing like the original Drop City.  There is never any mention of spiritual values and practices observed at the time.  Instead, the people portrayed are uniformly stupid, immature and degenerate.<BR> <BR>Boyle pulls in worst-case scenarios from several different communes and makes up the rest.  Its true that there were drugs used (but not the endless supply of marijuana, hallucinogens, uppers and downers that Boyles Drop City folks always have).  Its true that love was free (what kind of love isnt free anyway?) but not the mandate to ball anyone and everyone as in Boyles Drop City.  Incidentally, the words cat, chicks and ball are all East Coast words of the late 50s and early 60s.  Boyle shows that hes 10 years behind the times and geographically unhip when he insists on using these words so frequently in referring to a West Coast commune.  Sounds like hes imitating Tommy Chongs stoner spoofs.  Hes similarly sloppy throughout.  He has communards gathering peyote buds in the hills of California where peyote doesnt grow and never did, and he has rattlesnakes appearing where there are no rattlesnakes and never were.<br />Its ludicrous when he talks about voluntary poverty in one breath and then has the hippies eating eggs, toast and juice for breakfast, tahini casseroles and baloney sandwiches for lunch, home-canned goods and three-course dinners for supper with plenty of cookies and brownies all the time.  Three meals a day, when the most that any truly poor commune manages is two meals a day.<BR> <BR>And its downright silly when he has everybody puffing away on tailor-made cigarettes.  Most people in communes dont smoke tobacco (too expensive), but when they do, theyre always roll-your-owns.  And how about all that underwear?  Nobody that I know of wore underwear in rural communes of the times.<br />So then he has these supposedly poor but actually rich hippies moving to Alaska, after Drop City is bulldozed by the health department. Ive never been to Alaska and dont know the country or people, but its a safe bet from the inaccuracies of his portrayal of Northern California that he also misrepresented the Native Americans of Alaska.  There is no mention here of their ancient culture and values.  Here, he says that theyre all drunken, debauched, savage and filthy.<br />Its a shame that Boyle couldnt have turned his considerable narrative talents to another genre.  I say this because he does know his craft.  If he had a science background, he would probably be an excellent science fiction writer.  As it is, the characters in this novel are purposely shallow and two-dimensional because of his hidden agenda.  If you didnt know anything about his subject, youd think it was a good read.<br />Actually, its a stunt and a disappointment.  After all the glowing reviews, I want to add this note of dissent.  It could have been better a LOT better.  For openers, it could have been REAL.	2003-04-23

You don't have to read his previous three, *Secrets of the Talking Jaguar,* *Long Life, Honey in the Heart,* and *The Disobedience of the Daughter of the Sun* to understand and appreciate the message of *The Toe Bone and the Tooth* - but it helps.<br />This is a story about keeping the Great Story alive - \\"An Ancient Mayan Story Relived in Modern Times: Leaving Home to Come Home.\\"<br />It starts out with Martin's return to Guatamala in 1992 after many years in exile from his adopted country, where his village of Santiago Atitlan had been destroyed and 1800 of his friends and villagers slaughtered by American-backed death squads in the 1980s.  He was picked up at the airport by three teenage boys (who had been small children when the devastation took place) and smuggled back to the village under a truckload of Mayan squashes. Along the way, the boys were eager to hear the story of the Toe Bone and Tooth that had been outlawed (as well as their language) by the various and many invaders of their country. Landmarks of the Story were everywhere (much as Australian Dreamtime stories are dependent on the land for the telling).<br />Martin was welcomed in Santiago Atitlan as the Shaman and healer that he was for many years. He had had a Mayan wife and three sons there (one son died) and his little family had barely escaped with their lives.<br />The ancient story of the Toe Bone and Tooth is inserted here - the Story of a mortal, Raggedy Boy, who fell in love with the Water Goddess, the story of her death after bearing him two corn children and being forgotten when her husband returned to the mortal world. When he did remember her through dreams, he had to re-member her, gathering her bones with the help of Coyote (who had the toe bone and tooth) and descendinginto the underworld to retrieve her heart. He was helped by an old magical couple. Re-membered, she became an ordinary woman and he became an ordinary man, and from them, all humans are descended.<br />The next few chapters chronicle the story of Martin's first arrival in Santiago Atitlan - how he'd been lost in a blizzard in his American homeland of Northern New Mexico in his youth, and how he was saved by a mare named Morningstar and an old Spanish lady who cured him of an almost fatal fever with bear grease and herbs. During his convalescence, he had 11 dreams of Santiago Atitlan and Nicolas Chiviliu Tacaxoy, who was to become his teacher, friend and mentor and who had called him through dreams for three years before he finally arrived in the village. Says Prechtel, \\"Though I was blond and born far away, we were the old and young generation of throwbacks from other times and layers of existence in which a humble dynasty of people in service to the remembrance of the Dismembered Goddess was continued from century to century.\\"<br />Another chapter tells of Martin's defense of a young Mayan seminary student, Gaspar Culan, who was accused of worshipping idols because he had participated in an ancient Mayan sacred ceremony involving Holy Boy, whom the Catholic Church had branded as a devil but is actually a Christ figure. Martin (who speaks English, Spanish, and Mayan fluently) was to be Gaspar's advocate. Holy Boy had been called a Jew by the Church. Martin pointed out that they had dubbed the deity a Jew (and a devil) because Jews were at least considered to be human and therefore were subject to the 16th Century Inquisition. Mayans hadn't been considered people before that, so if their God was a Jew, the Inquisition could persecute and prosecute them. Martin won his case, and Culan was ordained as the first Mayan Catholic priest.<br />Several chapters are devoted to the Prechtel family's nothing-short-of-miraculous escape from Guatamala. Martin's teacher had ordered Martin to stay alive at all costs so that he might carry the seed of the story to the U.S. and preserve it for the Mayans whose history and culture had been outlawed.<br />When Martin got back to the U.S. and his old homeland in New Mexico, he and his family lived in poverty and difficulties for several years, but in Santa Fe he met a homeless couple who were like the old couple in the Story.  Here, the narrative goes into the third person as the old couple tell Martin's story and do for him what he had done for countless people in his life - re-membered him for the holy amnesiacs (all of us). Martin's story mirrors the Great Story - \\"the story of ordinary people, extraordinarily in love and the story of the struggle of what it takes to be graced with such love is the story from which all humans are descended.\\"<br />The author dedicates this book to the \\"deer-eyed daughter of the mountain, the mother of the great diversity\\" and to \\"all those peoples, plants and animals who have been and continue to be forcibly uprooted, rerouted, relocated, corralled, cut, branded, burnt out, burned down, burnt up, crushed, eradicated or driven from their homes in infinite diasporas of all types, to live where they may be unwelcome, while still trying to keep alive their seed capsules of cultural memory in hopes to regrow a home again. May their descendants be carved by the inherited grief of their ancestral loss to become feeders of what is holy in the ground, dedicated to something bigger than their need for justice and the pursuit of revenge.\\"<br />This is a fantastic, exciting but true story, and in my opinion, this is a life-changing book. Read it!	2003-03-27
US	49869538	RJ4R2MAIWQXE	0441519253	880345430	Maori	Books	5	55	58	N	N	An Epic Historical NOVEL	Ever since I saw the movie \\"The Piano\\", I've been curious about the Maori of New Zealand.  It is assumed that they are descendents of Polynesians, but their culture and character are unique.  They are a most intelligent and beautiful people.  When the English moved in to colonize, they were much quicker to learn the language and customs of the intruders than the British, Irish, Australians and Germas were to learn about them.  So they had a distinct advantage.  They had heard what happened to the indigenous peoples of the Americas, Australia, Africa and Asia when European Imperialists took over, enslaving and killing the natives and appropriating their land. Inevitably, the same thing happened to the Maoris too but not to such an extent.  Forewarned is forearmed.<br />The story starts in 1839 and spans more than 50 years.  It concerns an English sea captain of his times (who nevertheless learned the Maori language), and his sons by his English wife, his Irish mistress and the Maori love of his life.<br />What bothers me about *Maori* is that it's called an \\"epic historical fantasy.\\"  This is a misnomer since the fantastic elements in it are a matter of historical record.  After his epilogue, the author states that,<br />\\"Although real and fictional personages mix freely in this tale, the sighting of the death canoe by two separate parties of travelers and the entombment and subsequent rescue and death of the 104-year-old Maori, Tohunga [a shaman] known as Tuhoto, are a matter of historical record.\\"<br />As is the eruption in 1886 of the volcano Tarawera and the burying of the \\"eighth wonder of the world\\", the pink and white limestone terraces that drew sight-seers from all over the 19th century world.<br />Alan Dean Foster is known primarily as a science fiction writer, so his publishers probably assumed it had to be \\"historical fantasy.\\"  It's an historical novel.  Period.  I'm amazed that it has received no other Amazon reviews because it's quite simply the best historical novel I've ever read.istorical novel I've ever read.	2003-02-19

Nasdijj's writing style, to be sure, is unusual, but he has proved that he's a good writer with his previous book.  So what happened here?  The temptation is to blame it on his editor, or lack thereof.  A good editor would have told him that, first of all, about 100 pages need to be lopped off the work, that the clipped Hemmingway-type sentences and sentence fragments work in some cases, but they don't work here, that they sound contrived and phony.  A good editor would have told the author not to go on and on, paragraph after paragraph, rhyming in narrative form.<br />\\"The same stinking motel beds of sadness flare with our eyes and bleed.  To lean our weight against the curb.  The father and son are drenched and heard.  Or worse. The morning dogs await. The touch, the end, the kiss of fate. Sending us reeling over mountains to the sea. Stars back home break in ecstasy.\\"<br />It just gets worse and worse, meaning less and less.  It sounds like the author thinks he's being paid by the word, so he dug up some of his old adolescent attempts at poetry (all dreadful) and tortured them into fitting the narrative of the memoir.  They don't.  A good editor, in other words, would have saved him from himself.  It's especially disappointing because the Nasdijj has some important things to say and these devices distract and detract from the message, which is vital and urgent.<br />One of Nasdijj's missions in life seems to be finding and loving hopeless cases, lost boys.  In his first book, it was Tommy Nothing Fancy who had fetal alcohol syndrome; in this one, it's Awee, who is dying of AIDS.  One of Nasdijj's \\"sons\\" who didn't die but has a hearing impediment calls him on this when Nasdijj shuts Crow Dog out of helping him care for Awee.<br />\\"How am I going to know you through this?\\" he says. 'Now that there's a new one who will sort of take my place as your new lost cause.  You DO do that. Don't tell me you don't. For once, just SHUT UP.  It's done. Bring him over to my trailer and we'll play cards when you get over yourself, okay,' Crow said.  Then he left.\\"<br />In this book, the author calls attention to the deplorable state of Western medicine that ignores the pain of children with AIDS, denying already dying kids the relief of pain medication under the rationale that they might become addicted, when it's the stress and trauma of that excruciating pain that is shortening their lives even more.<br />There are no hilarious episodes such as the case of Onate's foot as in the previous book, but Nasdjii says some things here that you probably won't find anywhere else - things that need to be said.<br />\\"There is no consistency to AIDS treatment in America. That is a fact. The only concrete thing these medical systems share is that you have to fight to get anything from them. The good ones and the bad ones. You fight to get in and get treated.\\"<br />Then, to get pain medication, you have to resort to illegal sources, or else watch these innocents writhe in agony.<br />Nasdijj also draws attention to the way Uranium mines are killing Indian peoples with cancer.  Church Rock, near Gallup, New Mexico is a case in point.  \\"There is more yellowcake in this area than anywhere else on earth.\\"<br />\\"Some of the largest corporations in America simply declared brankruptcy in the early 1990s and walked away. If you're brankrupt, you're not liable for environmental damage, nor can you be sued.  So they just packed up and left the reservation.<BR>With the mess still there.<BR>It is all still there.\\"<br />\\"The Russians have Chernobyl. We have Church Rock, but you've never heard about Church Rock or the radioactive accident that occurred there.  An accidental spill released more radioactivity in the water table, and into the land, than was released at Three Mile Island.<BR>It was a nonevent.<BR>That is because to this day it is not considered to be NEWSWORTHY.They were only Indians.<BR>It is, however, a matter of public record.\\"<br />Nasdijj is right. I didn't know about this until I read it here and I live fewer than 30 miles away from the site of the spill.<br />Nasdijj has a heart bigger than all these wretched circumstances and enough love to wake up the world. If his editor hadn't been sleeping, *The Boy and the Dog are Sleeping* would have been one long howl as it was, I think, meant to be, without the detracting whine. But with all its faults, this memoir is well worth reading.	2003-02-17

The prehistoric pueblo Indian time frame is from the 6th to the 13th Centuries and the conquering Spanish overlays are investigated up to the 17th Century.  Archeological discovery times covered are from the 1930s to the 1960s.<br />College students, Native American helpers, and professional archeologists uncovered scores of embellished walls, different kinds of pottery and evidence of agricultural practices of the pueblo peoples, but conserving the finds was tricky at best and impossible at worst.  Some of the most stunning finds were at Pottery Mound in the Rio Puerco in New Mexico.  Wall paintings were startlingly abstract, complex and sophisticated.  Shells, pottery, and gemstones not found in the area evidenced trade with Mesoamerica while pictures of fish and bison indicated exchanges with plains Indians.<br />The downside of these finds, the inside story of how archeologist Frank Hibben fudged on and suppressed some of the data at Pottery Mound for instance, is also chronicled by the author.  At the end of her chapter on the subject, she states that \\"It is a pity that they are beclouded by controversy and that the original records are today beyond the reach of further scientific study.\\"<br />Photos in this book are clear and intriguing.  An excellent beginning and in my opinion a must-read for anyone interested in any or all of these five sites.<BR>...	2002-09-14

They both last.  They both tell part of the human story.  Somewhat in the tradition of Osa Johnson's famous chronicle, *I Married Adventure* of the previous generation, Florence Lister takes the reader along with her family through five continents and many years in search of ceramics, ancient and colonial.<br />Florence and her husband Bob, both archeologists, with their two young sons in tow, pursued pothunting in such diverse places as Glen Canyon in the American Southwest before it was inundated by Lake Powell and the Aswan High Dam area in Africa before it also went underwater.  From the 1940s to the 1990s, they did a great deal of contract archeology, i.e. investigating areas such as dams, highways, pipelines and the like that contain historical debris such as potsherds, bones, tools and tiles before they are swept away by modern civilization. The Listers contributed considerably to the body of knowledge about connections between pueblo Indians of the American Southwest and those of Mexico and Mesoamerica as well as trade routes that brought colonial pottery from Spain and Italy to the Americas.  The hard science is made more lively and interesting by the personal details.<br />For example, the JFK assassination occurred when the family was in Wadi Halfa in Africa.  Their Nubian servants insisted on sending a cable of condolences to Mrs. Kennedy, who had played an active role in the &quot;Save the Monuments of Nubia&quot; campaign.  Near Escalante in Utah, they uncovered more evidence about the disappearance of Everett Ruess.  They discovered dishes Cortez used and roofing erected by Columbus' party.  They found Genoese pots in Spanish ports, investigated porcelain in Japan (at the &quot;climbing kilns&quot;), T'ang pottery in China, amphorae in Greece and, like detectives, discovered old paintings depicting pottery that had found its way from Seville in Spain to the Americas.<br />This book sort of grows on you.  At the beginning, the language is a bit stilted and self-conscious, but after the author gets into the groove and finds her zone, you begin to participate in the exciting life the family led (not without some danger; they got mugged in Jamaica and got into another tight spot in Morocco).<br />If you're at all interested in archeology (incidentally, the American spelling is &quot;archeology&quot; and the British is &quot;archaeology&quot;) you'll relish this account and remember both scientific conclusions and personal anecdotes.  If you're not at all interested in the subject, you won't even be reading this review anyway.  But for the former group of people, it's a good, informative, and exciting read.	2002-08-25

The essays complement one another to present a more complete and cogent view of the antecedents and realities of the counterculture than any other volume I have yet seen on the subject.<br />Counterculture names, say Braunstein and Doyle, \\"...hippies, freaks, Flower Children, urban guerillas, orphans of Amerikka - underscores the degree to which Sixties cultural radicals had a revolving-door approach to identity, appropriating and shedding roles and personas at a dizzying pace.\\"  In these pages, the roles and personas in cultural politics, race, sex, the media (especially music, film and fashion), drugs, feminism, environmentalism and alternative visions of community and technology are thoroughly investigated.<br />\\"Unlike subcultures,\\" says Marilyn Young in the foreword, \\"...a contraculture aspires to transform values and mores of its host culture.  If it is successful...it BECOMES the dominant culture.\\"  I don't believe anyone would maintain that the counterculture of the '60s has become dominant, but its influence on our present culture is more vast and all-encompassing than much of the media would have us believe.<br />\\"The Sixties were centrally about the recognition on the part of an ever-growing number of Americans, that the country in which they thought they lived - peaceful, generous, honorable - did not exist and never had.\\"  The society they found themselves in was instead, \\"...morally bankrupt, racist, militaristic, and culturally stultifying.\\"<br />Against the climate of the VietNam war and race riots in the South, these essays note that the era was one of post-scarcity abundance.  Intentional poverty was adopted consciously by a generation that was appalled by the waste of human and material resources.  They wanted to figure out how to \\"...live a completely new life as far outside the boundaries of the State and commercial marketplace as they could get.\\"  Dropouts could live on the leftovers of this affluent society.<br />The San Francisco Diggers' motto was \\"create the condition you describe.\\"  Says Doyle, \\"For the Diggers, the word \\"free\\" was as much an imperative as it was an adjective.  They realized it with free housing, legal services, a medical clinic, film screenings, concerts, free [open]churches, and free stores with food, clothes and household utensils - all donated and gathered from the surrounding community.  The Mime Troupe and other street theater groups drew people in to create \\"happenings,\\" freaking freely on the streets and in public parks, de-legitimizing violence and racism, while the White Panthers staged a \\"total assault on the culture.\\"  Peacefully.<br />\\"If we make peaceful revolution impossible, we make violent revolution inevitable,\\" said JFK, and his words reverberate across cultural boundaries today.  But hippies didn't WANT to become the next coercive power structure in some kind of psychedelic fascism.  They wanted a \\"free frame of reference.\\"<br />Braunstein observes that the post-scarcity abundance of the era fueled a new drive toward leisure and play.  Against a system of \\"...lifelong competitiveness, materialism and avarice\\"...LSD and other mind-expanding drugs \\"...incapacitated the discriminating faculties of the brain that placed objects and images in hierachcies of value.\\"  David Farber adds that LSD and other hallucinogens were used as \\"...an agent in the production of cultural reorientation...a new set of cultural coordinates.\\"<br />My only beef with the book is in Philip Deloria's \\"Counterculture Indians and the New Age\\" and it's not even a criticism of the essay (which I found among the most brilliant and absorbing) but of scholarly research in general.  From personal knowledge, I know that there are egregious errors in what Deloria's sources reported about New Buffalo and Lorian.  Scholarly research breaks down when such sources are trusted, and Deloria gives an excellent example of this in the much-repeated death speech of Chief Seattle - who never uttered it.  It was written by a white screenwriter from Texas for a 1972 TV script on pollution.  Hippies and New Agers reinvented Indians without careful reference to the source.  And of course the image became marketable.<br />\\"Playing Indian,\\" says Deloria, \\"...had a tendency to lead one into, rather than out of, contradiction and irony\\" and \\"...people are simultaneously granted a platform and rendered voiceless.\\"<br />In his excellent essay on communes, Timothy Miller notes that they were \\"...enormously, endlessly diverse.\\"  \\"The ultimate culprit, perhaps, was that sacred American icon, individualism.  The time had come, communitarians believed, to give up the endless pursuit of self-interest and begin thinking about the common good.  They wanted the country to start moving from I to we.  It all added up to a vision of nothing less than a new society.  The new communitarians were out to save the world and made no bones about it.\\"<br />Miller's essay segues nicely into the last - on alternative technolgy, environment and the counterculture by Andrew Kirk.  Buckminster Fuller's geodescic domes were used extensively in the Drop City commune in Colorado as well as \\"...composting toilets, afforadble greenhouses, and organic gardening techniques along with alternative energy technologies.\\"  And don't forget that the first computer hackers, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, were longhairs who smoked grass.<br />It's not that there were no mistakes, ineptitudes and downright stupidities in this deliberately unorganized \\"happening\\" of the '60s and '70s, but that what was good about it is still good.  We're still out there.  Here.  Hippies didn't disappear and they didn't become corporate CEO's either.  Instead, nearly all became teachers, health care workers, artists, organic farmers, social works and the like.  \\"Cultural creatives\\" of the present, for instance, are either hippies of yesteryear or their heirs in some way.<br />\\"They are still out there, well into a third generation, coming together by the tens of thousands once a year at the Rainbow Gatherings.  The hallucinogenic age, while tamed in some respects, has survived and mutated and reproduced.\\"<br />This is the closest thing to the WHOLE STORY\\" that I've seen yet.

Frances Wilson has connected the dots and produced a unique and astonishing study of this perhaps unholy alliance.<br />Beginning with the famous courtship of Elizabeth Barrett by Robert Browning as a kind of contrast/control because of its relative wholesomeness, Wilson goes on to explore the more pathological literary seductions of Anais Nin and Henry Miller, Laura Riding and Robert Graves, Osip and Nadzheda Mandelstam, and W.B. and Georgie Yeats.  The Brownings were more normal and sane, according to this author, because they achieved the \\"...transition from a love of one another's words to a broader love beyond the literary.\\"<br />But the dynamic of the more pathological literary seductions are different for all.  Anais Nin and Henry Miller were possessed by words.  \\"Henry saw the English language as a part of his body\\" while Anais \\"...believed words were speaking HER rather than the other way around.\\"  They both wrote constantly and compulsively and their sexual involvement with each other was defined by their writing.<br />Laura Riding, on the other hand, was \\"la belle dam sans merci.\\"  She and Robert Graves together created this mythic persona of Laura and they both fed upon and nurtured it in their writing.  They did not \\"...live to tell the tale so much as tell the tale in order to find a way of living.\\"  In other words, they wrote themselves into existence.<br />For the Russian husband and wife team, Osip and Nadzheda Mandelstam, life was a Gulag Archipelago.  Osip was tormented by the poems that he heard as a buzzing in his brain until he wrote them down.  But he had to memorize them rather than write them because he was so constantly subject to arrest and imprisonment.  So his wife, Nadzheda, contained them within herself, committing them to memory much as Brandbury's characters in *Fahrenheit 451* memorized whole books because the written word had become illegal.  Osip and Nadzheda completed one another to such an extent that their separations were torture to both.<br />W.B. Yeats and his wife, Georgie, also wrote together on an intimate level, but in this case, Georgie received her husband's creative thoughts by automatic writing.  She was his conduit; his writing hand was her hand.  She wrote constantly and feverishly to such an extent that their authorship was blurred and defined by one another.<br />In all these latter cases, there was at least one third party in the equation.  For Miller and Nin, there was June (Miller's wife).  Geoffrey Phibbs and Nancy Graves were present in the Graves-Riding duo.  Laura Riding was \\"...endlessly getting rid of the third party in the way of her relationship, whilst she needed this third party in order to have the relationship in the first place.\\"  For the Mandelstams, there was the poetess, Anna Akhnatova, and for W.B. and Georgie Yeats, there was Anne Hyde (who had died in the 17th Century but who appeared in Georgie's automatic writing).<br />If you're not a reader of literature, you probably won't be reading this review anyway, but if you're an inveterate reader and all of your heroes are writers (not cowboys), this book will absorb and fascinate you with its engaging style, scholarly research and in-depth psychological profiles.	2002-03-21

A recurring theme of the novel, like a drumbeat through all of its pages, is Taos Pueblo's concern with the return of their sacred Blue Lake, which was taken away from them, without recompense, by the U.S. government in 1906.<br />Taos Pueblo, nestled in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of Northern New Mexico, is the oldest continually occupied pueblo in North America, reputed to have been the refuge of the ancient Anasazi who fled a drought in the 13th Century.  This lake is the site of emergence in the Taos religion.<br />In 1906, Teddy Roosevelt established the Carson National Forest, taking the 50,000 acres of Taos land, the watershed of the Rio Lucero and Rio Pueblo that runs through Taos Pueblo as government land. The Taos Indians waived their right to the town of Taos and surrounding areas, asking only for the return of their sacred lake. They refused money for it.  Instead, the U.S. Forest Service cut roads into the area, made it available to campers and tourists, built cabins and corrals, allowed fishing in the sacred lake itself, allowed grazing of herd animals into the area, allowed illegal clear cutting of some 2,000 acres of timber, and threatened to mine the area immediately adjoining Blue Lake.  To the Indians, this was comparable to developers taking over the Washington Cathedral and turning it into a strip mall or a camping site.<br />The Pueblo had formidable opponents - the Forest Service, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Budget Committee, the BIA, and New Mexico Senator Clinton P. Anderson, who at first persuaded the Indians that he was on their side.  But white man spoke with forked tongue and viciously opposed the bill to give back the land that Taos Indians had held since time immemorial.  He refused to believe that these Native Americans didn't want to exploittheir own land (as all true-blooded Americans do), with timbering grazing and mining.  He had an underground deal with a mill owner who had already illegally clear cut a huge chunk of it.<br />In 1921, using the Religious Crimes Act as its chief weapon, the U.S. government made the practice of Indian religious ceremonies a punishable offense.  Government officials invaded the Tribal Council, stole and destroyed religious objects in their kivas and had the old Indian elders arrested and put in jail in Santa Fe.  In other words, everyone in America had religious freedom except for its oldest inhabitants - the Indians.<br />But the Pueblo people also had formidable friends throughout the 64 years of their struggle - writers and artists of Taos such as Mabel Dodge Luhan, Olivar La Farge, Frank Waters - and into the '50s and '60s when politicos got into the fray - Interior Secretary of the Interior under Johnson, Stuart Udall, his brother, Morris Udall, Senator from Arizona, Senators Edward and Robert Kennedy, Barry Goldwater, Corrine Locker (secretary to Oliver La Farge) and many others including hippies all over the country who took up the cause of Native Americans as their own.  The struggle for Blue Lake made strange bedfellows indeed.<br />Taos Pueblo Indians flew on an airplane for the first itme in their lives to Washington to attend hearings before the Senate Subcommittee.  Several times.  But the culmination of the hearings happened when Nixon was President and the venerated 93-year-old Cacique, the spiritual leader of Taos Pueblo, Juan de Jesus Romero, spoke to Congress so movingly and with such spiritual presence (bringing his three canes of office from the King of Spain, President Abraham Lincoln and President Nixon with him) that Washington was stunned, and on December 15, 1970, Bill HR 471 was signed by Nixon into Law and Taos Pueblo got back 48,000 acres of their sacred space including their beloved Blue Lake.<br />This book is tedious at times, only because the whole process of American justice is tedious, agonizing and incredibly difficult. The Pueblo went into great debt to pay legal fees.  But it is a story of victory.  I don't know whether Nixon did other good services for the American people, but this is certainly the best thing he ever did.  And he had both bipartisan opposition and bipartisan support for this amazing action.  It has set a precedent for self-determination (not assimilation) for Native American peoples throughout the country.<br />This is not a coffee table book with glossy pictorials but a chronicle of the complete story of Blue Lake, replete with historical photographs of the area and the people who were involved in the struggle.  If you're not at all interested in this period of our history as a nation, this work will bore you and you won't bother to read it.  But if you are interested in the whole scoop about the return of Blue Lake, the last chapters, especially, will leave you mesmerized - and hopeful.  Hopeful about American justice and the future of our society.	2002-01-27
US	49869538	R2R5QDM1CGAIYQ	0938756605	700618682	The Disobedience of The Daughter of The Sun	Books	5	48	53	N	N	Of Time and Water - an Ecology of Spirit	We in the West have at least a nodding acquaintance with the coded language of various mythic traditions - the Greco-Roman, the Norse, the Celtic - but here is something unique.  It is a centuries-old story to live by - an ecology of the spirit - told by an ancient people, recorded and interpreted by Martin Prechtel.<br />Prechtel gathered the Story over years of living among the Tzutujil Maya in Guatemala where he learned their language.  Since these people were almost totally wiped out by American-backed death squads in the '80s, this a treasure book.<br />The Story, then, is of the beautiful Tall Daughter of the Sun (a workaholic) and his wife, the Moon (somewhat of a shrew).  Their daughter weaves the world alive on her loom - a womb of creation.  She is a being too elevated in her parents' eyes to have a mate because, of course, no man is good enough for her.  [Sound familiar?]<br />Enter the Short Boy - a little man shining with &quot;...a green brilliance, which in the right light sparkled iridescent...&quot;  He comes in the morning after her parents have gone to work.  They recognize each other immediately as the Beloved.  Turns out that he is the son of Hurricane and Ocean (but she doesn't find that out until she is running away with him). When their liaison is inevitably discovered, the Daughter, in her own defense, truly maintains that they never touched.  &quot;What they did do for hours was lose each other fast and far inside the other's eyes.&quot;  [Remember that?] She loves him.<br />Mother Moon, in a hissy fit and a twirling rage, says..&quot;Love him!  Him!  How can you love something that can only lick your knees?  Well?!!  And the Daughter is &quot;...chilled by the winds of her mother's hatred and by the shock of being hated for the first time.&quot;  [Been there, done that - yet?]<br />How their arch-enemy, the Northwind, blows all their hopes to smithereens and how the Beloved Daughter of all creation is re-membered into a new form, is the substance of the rest of the story.  It has elements of other world myths in it (the gathering of her parts somewhat like Isis gathering Osiris, for instance), but unlike the Norse Baldar myth where all present pass the buck for the god's demise, or the compromise cyclic disappearance and return myth of the Greek Eleusinian Mysteries, all creatures in the Mayan world accept responsibility for their complicity in either precipitating the tragedy or letting it happen.  And they all cooperate, with grief, repentance and hope, in an effort to bring the Daughter, who is life itself, back to life in any form.<br />Told with humor, compassion, mystery and understanding, I wouldn't call this story a myth set in granite.  It's an interactive live Story of Life reverberating through time.  I read the entire book with the author's five levels of commentaries (aloud in parts.  The entire narrative reads like a prose poem).  And then I went back and read the Story again, and its world view began to enter my dreams. [No kidding!]<br />Prechtel's commentaries add layers of understanding.  In the first layer, he observes that, &quot;To punish or trivialize the youth for having subtlety of vision is what makes depression an epidemic in modern culture.&quot;<br />&quot;So often the artist is sacrificed for the art and the art is what lives.  This story tells us that our art must be sacrificed, turned into a magic that puts us back together in a new way and hatches the world back to life&quot; and that &quot;...living the life of an artist is not as useful as living our lives as a work of art.&quot;<br />In the second layer, he notes that:  &quot;In this story-method of learning, we humans become part of the geography of nature, important not because of our inventories or conquests, or chronicles of having been victimized, or our labor-saving inventions that kill this geography, or our egalitarianism or our capacity to get to heaven, but just for having been born and showing up for work, the work of living out our part of the story.&quot;<br />In the third layer, the author talks about indigenous languages that eliminate the verb &quot;to be.&quot;  I'm still having trouble wrapping my mind around this concept, but as I understand it, &quot;to be&quot; is an abstraction and indigenous people don't distance themselves from the rest of creation by abstractions.<br />&quot;The brilliant ingenuity of Indigenous language...though often mounted on rails of metaphor, is the way they zoom way past metaphor into realms of undertandings that have metaphor looking rather naive,&quot; says Prechtel.<br />&quot;A ritual can &quot;be&quot; the universe, because the ritual and the universe can be the same thing.  In this way our bodies are not metaphors of the Earth; they are the Earth.&quot;<br />Unlike her future in-law, the Sun, whose Time only lives now, the Ocean is nonsequential time, time already done, time to come, time that will never happen, time that could have happened and more, all mixed into one large matrix of Gathered Time.&quot;  Time and water.  &quot;To the Tzutujil there is only one water which rushes, puddles or is captured in a multitude of diverse forms like plant leaves, hot springs, rivers, lakes, ponds, ice, tears and streams, and like the amniotic flood at our births, all this water is trying to get back home to the original mother of life, the Great Grandmother Ocean, the great dream pool.&quot;<br />The fourth layer is a true story in present time that puts it all on the palm of your hand like a Hummingbird and the fifth layer is a perfect round waterdrop - a distillation like brandy from the wine of the Story.<br />I wish I could give this work 8 stars.  Eight would be just about right.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2001-12-01
US	49869538	R396WK7HN50HUT	1588204995	789124151	The Shill	Books	2	1	2	N	N	Shill is a Shuck	There are so many things wrong with this book that it's surprising that there could be anything good about it. Heavy-handed and contrived, it seems to have been written with an axe instead of a pen. The author's narrative voice careens all over the place between characters, and most of the situations and circumstances are not believable. It is easier to suspend disbelief while reading most science fiction than it is for this story. The tale is supposed to be about a hard-as-nails Shaolin monk, but the cover pictures a wimp in an orange toga.<br />Some characters are undoubtedly modeled on real people, but even they are not fleshed out to resemble actual human beings. I'm guessing that O'Bannon is Emmet Grogan, The Poet is Allen Ginsberg, and the Riggers are most probably the Diggers. Tahiti was allowed to keep his own name but not developed as a character. I did recognize the man who lives near Silver City and makes his own beer but only because the author says the beer tastes like champagne, and there could be only one such person. Otherwise, the characters are cardboard with gimmicks to give them a pseudo-depth, including the main character who is annoyingly dubbed John Stuart Bradley O'Boogey, which becomes even more annoying when the author spells it four different ways - O'Boogey, O'Boogie, O&quot;Boogey and O'Boogy. Fritz' spelling and grammar are consistently atrocious with &quot;fiercesome&quot; for fearsome, &quot;ceremnoy&quot; for ceremony and the constant confusion of &quot;affect&quot; and &quot;effect.&quot;<br />There are some pretty ghastly sentences that are almost funny in their muddle-headedness. Sentences such as &quot;The only dangerous quality it possesses is to carve a power perogative of the raw stone of worship and force it on the user, to insist beyond human endurance&quot; do appear to be written in English (as Alice in Wonderland would say) but wouldn't make a particle of sense in any language. Or how about, &quot;Jean Louis continued hissilence, his feelings now bordering the paranoid side of life.&quot; And then there's this gem: &quot;Since not eating or getting the calories from grains to the measure of a tradeoff with meat is generally considered life threatening, some of these men became skilled hunters, whalers, trackers on land and sea. O&quot;Boogey had taken his turn at these functions and thereby shaving the last hair off the body of his mind.&quot;<br />This is, of course, extremely bad writing. Nevertheless, the peyote meeting sections were not only entertaining but sounded real. The author has obviously been to meetings and had medicine (although in my experience, women DO sing after midnight and the peyote hippies I know DO know the Indian songs). Fritz does have a fair amount of political insight, some good raw material and a sense of humor, so the book could have been at least much better after a complete rewrite with a literate copyeditor. But as it stands now, I don't believe this work should have seen print before these matters had been addressed.	2001-07-19
US	49869538	R37FQL3TLE9TKT	0743202031	140386806	Juniper Tree Burning: A Novel	Books	5	18	21	N	N	A Splendid Debut	I don't believe we really know what we were all about as a generation until our children tell us what it was like for them.  Why did we choose voluntary poverty?  Why did we choose to live among and be instructed by Indians?  Why did we bake our own bread, learn about herbal medicine, and live with outhouses, without running water?  Why did we give birth to our children at home and why did we name them after the flora and fauna of the places where we were?  Names like Cedar, Sage, Juniper, Coyote, Sunflower, Chamisa?  Names like Goldberry?  Lady Goldberry was a golden girl in the Tolkein Trilogy, *Lord of the Rings* which we had all read.  We were living in a fantasy, to be sure, but who is to say that our fantasy was not lovelier, lighter, and more compassionate than the fantasies of the '50s in which we'd grown up - except our children.<br />*JUniper Tree Burning* is in novel form, but it tells the truth about our generation as well as the author's generation.  &quot;You need not tell all the truth, unless to those who have a right to know it all,&quot; said Horace Mann, &quot;but let all you tell be truth.&quot;  Ms. Long has succeeded admirably in telling the truth about her own slice of space-time from the '60s on to the present.<br />The book is deeply psychological and intensely autobiographical even though circumstances, events and characters are altered by the magic of a sure novelist's art.  The author changes only the closest geographical names, for instance, but accurately portrays the life and landscape of Arroyo Hondo, Taos, Santa Fe and Albuquerque.  She changes names and edits events, but you hear Goldberry being told that &quot;you don't think - you just barge ahead like the Capricorn you are&quot; - her mom's self-fulfilling prophecy.  You can see her hiding beind her own face.  &quot;It's a good trick to have.  You turn your face into a mask and then you are safe behind it, especially when your mother calls you a stupid name which is not yours, and which you hate.&quot;<br />And you look into the eyes of Juniper/Jennifer/Goldberry's father and brother - &quot;pale green, so light they almost seem transparent.  See-through eyes I've always called them.&quot;  But you could easily read the whole book and not have a clue that the god-medicine, the sacred host of the Meeting Way - is peyote.  The word is never mentioned, because it does not need to be mentioned in the interests of truth.<br />The truth is, &quot;That's how to be a woman.  You cook for a hundred people on Christmas Day.&quot;  The truth is in &quot;the confusion of loving and hating, leaving and arriving, leaving and arriving, like the ocean, the tide, the waves.&quot;  The truth is that &quot;...he'll never be a woodsman in the forest who saves the children.  That is why he is so sad.&quot;  The truth is contained in the very real problems and persecution the little hippie kids experienced from both teachers and students in Northern New Mexico at the time.  (I know.  My own children suffered similarly.)  <br />The truth is in Ms. Long's self-awareness.  Her alter-ego, Juniper, got into a private school on scholarship, &quot;by hawking my sordid past, making it seem tragic and lovely, and painting big idealisitc plans for the future...because you tell the part of the truth that gets you what you need.  You make them believe they should be astonished.&quot;  And she knows what she's doing.  &quot;You can't have it both ways, you teenage monsters.  You don't get to act like you know everything and then cry, But I didn't know!&quot;<br />Reading the first half of this book, I was struck by how the author skillfully uses various literary devices - moving fluidly between third and first person for instance (you never have to go back as you do in a Russian novel to figure out who is saying what).  I marveled at the lyricism, the true voices in her dialogue, and the penetrating psychological insights.  I felt a fair amount of generational pride.  This girl - this incredible young woman - can really write!  Having been so dismayed by so many children-of-the-'60s and children-of-the-children-of-the-'60s stories that capitaize on half-truths and downright lies - this was a breath of fresh air.  And not only that - it's honest-to-god literature!<br />But then, I became caught up in the STORY - and read it in immense gulps right through to the very moving and redemptive end.  It made me cry (and I'm a tough old bird - not much can make me tear up like this).  Goldberry was able to appreciate her family - the parents who taught her how to live on the land.  &quot;I will say to my father and mother, I think I understand.  You did your best.  You loved this valley, nestled into the mesa.&quot;  They taught her so much and gave her so much of themselves, and the love that shines through all this is dazzling. Redemptive.  The fact that she kept her name, Goldberry, speaks volumes.<br />This is a splendid first novel by a mature and insightful young woman who knows whereof she speaks and doesn't tell lies to pander to any literary styles or expectations.  Critics have said that it's too long, but I maintain that not a single word is wasted.  Even if you're going into it cold - not knowing anything at all about the space-time coordinates of the story - its appeal is universal.  That's the mark of great writing by a master craftsman and artist.  Bravo Goldberry!  Keep on keeping on. May you live LONG and prosper.<br />...	2001-06-25
US	49869538	R202HHL0PFMVXH	0816520526	48505618	Killing Time with Strangers (Sun Tracks: An American Indian Literary Series, Vol. 45)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Dreaming your reality	After reading this book, I think that Magical Realism, Native American style, may catch on as a distinct genre.  The author, an \\"urban mixblood Nex Perce\\" is an English professor and it shows through in echoes from classical literature, but Penn also includes the classics of the Americas (such as the Popul Vuh) which makes this work unique and why I think that Penn may have opened up a whole new genre (if anybody can follow this act).<br />\\"Without storytelling, human beings don't exist\\" says Penn's narrator (a \\"Wyekin\\" or spirit guide, who, in his comic incopetence reminds me of Ed's Indian spirit guide in TV's \\"Northern Exposure\\").<br />This is the story of Palimony Blue Larue, son of Mary Blue and La Vent Larue, misnamed in the hospital becuase a nurse couldn't imagine anybody naming thier kid \\"Palomino\\" after a horse!  So Pal goes through life trying to please and be liked as his father before him did, while his mother and her Weyekin spirit guide try to prevent him from making his father's mistakes and teach him how to dream his way out of the white world.  His mother didn't want him in their world. Says Mary Blue, \\"I want him to envision and make a world of his own in which they are not foolish but all their knowledge and instinct don't matter because they don't have any effect.\\"  <br />This must have been the spirit that prompted the famous Ghost Dance.<br />Pal's mother, Mary Blue, is the spider woman on the set, goddess of wisdom and time, endlessly beading and feeding strangers and friends the way Penelope did - or one of the Fates.  She has \\"...years of her Dreamer's practice at harmony, at the balance that comes from not judging until it's time and even when it became time, ususally not judging the person but maybe the results, and not harshly, which came full circle from the balance achieved by not judging, but putting the thing itself in perspective, by connecting it to five hundred years of human activity and thought, by seeing that very little aboutreal human beings really changes.  Once you realize that, once you learn to dream, which helps to create that realization, you gain humor - sometimes, outright laughter - but always the humor that is the resilience of survival.\\"<br />How much of this is like the Australian aboriginal dreamtime, I wonder?<br />Pal gradually catches on, but with his own spin.  His yellow butterflies become post-it notes by which he dreams his ideal woman, Amanda, into existence.  But Amanda does declare towards the end of the book that \\"I'm real.\\"  Not something Pal dreamed.  \\"Dreaming is an imaginative act.  But it's very real,\\" he says.  \\"Like telling stories.  The Navajo beleive that by articulating something, putting it into words, you actually make it exist.  You bring it into being.  Dreaming's like that.  It makes things exist by imagining them with power.  It makes them exist by imagining a world in which they mean a lot.\\"  <br />Pal's epiphany comes when he burns his post-it notes and says they're \\"dead lectures...names and dates and questions that have to mean what people have already decided they have to mean.  Not a single hidden meaning in one of them.  Nothing that lets you glimpse the other side of things or look for what's behind or between the words, like stories.\\"<br />Besides the classical references, there are echoes of other authors in this work - Erdrich and Silko, Anaya and even Alexie - but Penn still has his own voice.  He could have used a better editor who would have weeded out sentences such as, \\"Odd how they don't want their listeners to take part in how their stories make the world, though, isn't it?\\" which is simplistic at best and patronizing at worst.  And you have to connect the dots and pay attention or else you have to go back and check the author's definition of terms.  But it's worth it for the world view.<br />I'm making this work sound like a literary exercise - which it isn't.  It's an entertaining story, but you have to pay attention or miss the point.  You have to read it to the end to get to the beginning.  So it's not light reading.  But again, it's worth it.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2001-05-16

For one thing, they operate inNew York and Chicago - gangster towns.  But they differ from the Mafiain that they pare primarily con artists and thieves - not murderers(unless cornered) and their women are never prostitutes.<br />SinceGypsies have begun traveling in cars instead of horses and coveredwagon caravans, they've become even more invisible.  There are Gypsiesnow on all of the continents of the Earth with many tribes - theKalderasha, the Lowara, Tshurana, Muchwaya, among others.  Mostanciently, they were musicians, fortune tellers, coppersmiths - butnever farmers.  Now they are all of the above as well as con artistsextraordinaire.<br />&quot;The success of any good con hinges on takingthe victim where he wants to go,&quot; quotes the author from a policereporter.  &quot;These women are very, very good.  You can even go inthere knowing it's a setup, and they'll have you unstrung in minutes.Sometimes when they're operating like that, I think they believe itthemselves.&quot;<br />Popular wisdom says they came from India sincetheir Romany language has Sanskrit roots, but they all count in Greek(probably beginning from the time when Alexander the Great brought atroupe of Gypsey musicians, actors, fortune tellers, and metelsmithsto Macedonia).  They have intermarried and absorbed cultural practicesfrom every country they have traveled through, but the Roma remaindistinct and independent - and obstinately illiterate.  They refuse tosend their children to &quot;Gadje&quot; schools (a Sanskrit wordmeaning warrior - or 'non-gypsey').  If pressure by the local populaceto put their children in school becomes too great - they move on.  Butthey didn't move fast enough during the holocaust because almost asmany Gypsies as Jews went to the gas chambers.<br />This book chroniclesthe true story of King Tene and Queen Mary Bimbo - the King and queenof the Gypsies in New York, where they rented store fronts and thewomen practiced the Boojo - an elaborate con game designed to separatewealthy Gadje from their money.  In an interview with an old Gypseymatriarch, Aunt Hazel, Maas recorded her statement that, &quot;Allright, she said with a massive shrug, &quot;it's true that we stealwith the hands, but you Gadje - you Americans - YOU steal with thepencils.&quot; Her voice rose.  &quot;And how many Gypsies you seegoing to jail for 20, 50 years for murderings and rapings andmuggings?&quot;<br />King Tene Bimbo and Queeen Mary had a son, CarranzaTene, an alcoholic, who was disliked by other Gypsies and wasparticularly brutal with his own family.  He forced his daughters tomarry while he pocketed the large bride prices (women are veryvaluable to Gypsey cultures as they are ususally the primarybreadwinners - especially now in modern society).  Carranza's son,Steve Tene, freed one of his sisters from a hateful marriage, therebyincurring the wrath of his father.  But then the old Granfather died -King Tene - and bypassed Carranza, his eldest son, and on hisdeathbed, gave the gold ring and medallion of Gypsey Kingship to hisgrandson, Steve Tene, who is the subject of this book<br />Carranza putan uncharacteristically Gypsey contract on his son's head - attemptingto kill him many times - but the Gypsies honored the old man's lastwishes and gave Steve Tene his grandfather's gold medallion and ring.(There is a picture in the book of the handsome Steve - he looks likeOmar Sherif) wearing the ring and holding the medallion with a bemusedexpression on his face.  He didn't WANT to be King of the Gypsies.His only pronoucements as King have been to encourage Gypsieseverywhere to become educated and get into the legitmate professions.They are a very intelligent people.  Steve has his champions and hisdetractors.  All this stuff is still going on and last I've heard,Steve Tene is still alive and still King.<br />I can't imagine why thisbook is out of print.  Theauthor is also the author of *Serpico*.  Anexcellent movie was made by the same title and is still available onamazon.com.  It stars such notables as Susan Sarandon, Eric Roberts, ayoung Brooke Shields, and even Shelly Winters.  The film takes someliberties (has Steve throwing the ring and medallion into hisgrandfather's grave.  Didn't happen).  But for the most part, themovie follows the book, which is a true story, and yet many are underthe impression that the movie is wholly fiction.  It's not.<br />Foranyone who has become as fascinated as I have with this most ancientculture (and I believe their origins are much more ancient than India)this is a must-read.  These are real interviews with real people and anumber of interesting photographs of real Gypsies are included - notsome scholarly tome to be moldering away on the shelves of theunread.<br />Peter Maas put all the the investigatory power and insightthat went into *Serpico* into this book, and I think it should see asecond printing...	2001-03-25

They are arranged chronologically by order of publication, so you can see the maturation of the artist in these pages.<br />&quot;Semley's Necklace&quot; was the germ of the later novel *Rocanon's World.*  In this story, Rocanon was a minor character who just wouldn't &quot;sink obediently into obscurity&quot; as the author says in her introduction, and &quot;you really can't argue with these people.&quot;<br />&quot;April in Paris&quot; is an entertaining time travel story in which characters from past and future travel to 1463 to join a literature professor from our time in his quest to investigate the mysterious disappearance of the poet Francois Villon.<br />&quot;The Masters&quot; is, in the author's words, her first &quot;genuine authentic real virgin wool SF story.&quot;  But it's also a psychomyth, set in a future time when math had become one of the &quot;black arts&quot; and its rediscovery becomes most costly for the hero.<br />&quot;Darkness Box&quot; is a magical tale set in no-time - a sort of fable - one of Le Guin's fortes.<br />&quot;The Word of Unbinding,&quot; like &quot;Semley's Necklace&quot; later grew into a book - four actually - *The Earthsea Trilogy* and a sequel.  It lays the groundwork for the most consistent essential element of how magic works in Earthsea.<br />&quot;The Rule of Names&quot; is a sword and sorcery tale, but with an interesting little twist.<br />&quot;Winter's King&quot; is another seminal story, the beginning idea for Le Guin's masterpiece, *The Left Hand of Darkness.*  Since the novel came out, she has written another short story (in a Dozois collection) about the planet Winter, Karhide, and the androgynous Gethenians.  I hope she writes more of these.<br />&quot;The Good Trip&quot; is a whimsical psychological tale, set in the '60s, of a trip that never happened - except that it did.<br />&quot;Nine Lives&quot; is one of the best clone stories I've ever read.  It's right up there with Kate Wilhelm's excellent *Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang.*<br />&quot;Things&quot; is another parable-like tale of the strangeness and daring of human ingenuity.<br />&quot;A Trip to the Head&quot; reminds me of the episode in *Alice in Wonderland* when Alice found herself in a wood where there were no names - for anything.<br />&quot;Vaster Than Empires and More Slow&quot; (based on the Hainish series) is hard science fiction with strong psychological observations, and here you can see the maturation of the writer.  In the exploration of another planet, astrophysics, biology and human and alien psychology come into play with a peculiarly satisfying ending.<br />What happens to the creative mind (in this case, an astronomer) when it is driven underground?  The next story, &quot;The Stars Below&quot; answers that question.<br />&quot;The Field of Vision&quot; is another true nuts-and-bolts SF story about the exploration of an alien planet, but with the author's usual psychological depth and insights, this time about the nature of human perception.<br />&quot;Direction of the Road&quot; is also about perception, of humans and - trees (there are an uncommon number of trees in Le Guin's stories, not only in her excellent *The Word for World is Forest* but also in her short stories).<br />&quot;The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas&quot; should have been, in my opinion, the last story in the book because it is a parable, or a psychomyth if you will, on the theme of sacrifice (although I don't believe the word &quot;sacrifice&quot; is ever used in the story) and would have been a more fitting ending to the collection.  &quot;This is the treason of the artist:&quot; says Le Guin, &quot;a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain.&quot;<br />However, I do understand the author's reasoning in putting &quot;The Day Before the Revolution&quot; last because the heroine of this story is one of those who walked away from Omelas.  This one is a spinoff from her story about the planet of *The Dispossessed* which is a novel about anarchism.  Real anarchism.  &quot;Not the bomb-in-the-pocket stuff, which is terrorism, whatever name it tries to dignify itself with; not the social-Darwinist economic 'libertarianism' of the far right; but anarchism as prefigured in early Taoist thought...its principal moral-practical theme is cooperation (solidarity, mutual aid).&quot;<br />This is a fine collection and its author, in my opinion, is one of the most influential writers of the genre responsible for bringing science fiction up to the caliber of true literature.<br />pamhan99@aol.comast because the heroine of this story is one of those who walked away from Omelas.

The ancient Anasazi settled around Taos in 1000 A.D. and Taos Pueblo (dating from about 1350) is the oldest continually occupied pueblo in the Southwest.  When the Spanish arrived in 1540, they set their seal on the ancient community, building churches and missions and farming the land.  Then Mabel Dodge Luhan &quot;discovered&quot; this magical place (it is said that Taos Mountain draws people) and an influx of Anglo artists and writers began, among them D.H. Lawrence, Andrew Dasburg, Georgia O'Keeffe, Ernest Blumenschein, Micolai Fechin...the list is too long to mention all of them here.  Later, R.C. Gorman, John Nichols, Natalie Goldberg and many others who have achieved fame in the outside world made their home in Taos (which means, &quot;place of the red willow&quot;).<br />Chapters are devoted to Kit Carson, Padre Martinez, the Penitentes, the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge and even the influx of hippies with a chapter on the New Buffalo commune in Arroyo Hondo north of Taos.  There are maps, portraits, landscapes, architecture, quotes, reminiscences, stories of ghosts, little-known facts and even recipes (one for green chile stew) in this rich, very readable and delightful work.  I found no inaccuracies but did find a great deal of information that I hadn't known about before.  Highly recommended.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2001-02-28
US	49869538	R2PNFTRIR9ENHR	0688144322	223192825	Orange Rhymes With Everything	Books	3	5	7	N	N	Orangemen had difficult Irish childhoods too!	At first I thought this was an *Angela's Ashes* clone, beginning as it did with a grim Irish childhood.  But no.  Adrian McKinty speaks with an Irish voice, to be sure, but it is his own voice.  Like Joyce Carol Oates, he refrains from using quotes in his dialogue, to good advantage.  The device brings his characters closer.  After some confusion about who is talking when and where, the reader adjusts, understands and gets with the flow.  It's &quot;wee&quot; for &quot;little,&quot; &quot;arse&quot; for &quot;ass&quot; and sentence construction contains somewhat of the brogue, &quot;Black and voracious are the lines between us&quot; says he.  Toward the end it all pulls together philosophically.<br />&quot;This whole society was sick.  He could see that now.  Sick and indifferent to it all.  They had their hard wee God; white and dour and manifest.  Their country crawling with believers.  The homogeneity of it was crippling.&quot;  And later,<br />&quot;Couldn't they see?  How could they?  With their pariah eyes and the schizophrenic noose of their allegiance.  Split between loving England and hating it.  Booing the English at football games and mourning when their soldiers died.  These people who didn't even know if they wanted to be called Irish or not.  Stateless.  Orphans of history with only their mad religion to give them any identity at all.&quot;<br />I don't enjoy violence in novels or movies, but this is not gratuitous violence.  The author is telling it like it is.  My only problem is with the female protagonist.  She's not convincingly female - not because she's precocious and perceptive, not because of the nose-picking or scatological references. It's a &quot;je ne sais quoi&quot;. I hear a young boy talking - not a young girl.  McKinty's other female characters are believable enough, but then, they are all in the background.<br />This is, in my opinion, a stunning first novel with a great deal of promise.  I will be looking forward to future contributions by Adrian McKinty.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2001-01-05
US	49869538	R1D58UEQ7O7C42	0872863344	14406430	The Continual Pilgrimage: American Writers in Paris, 1944-1960	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Tale of Two Cities:  New York and Paris	More broadly, this is a tale of two countries: France and America, and how artists are perceived in each.<br />American expatriates living in France, especially Paris, between the great wars, are well known - Hemingway, Pound, Wolfe, Stein, Miller, Fitzgerald, Cummings, Elliot - just to name a few.  What is not as well known or realized is that the exodus continued well into the '60s with Black writers Wright, Baldwin, and Himes, with the Beats, Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti, Corso, Burroughs, with mainstream writers, James Jones, Irwin Shaw, Terry Southern, and William Styron, and with academics such as W.H. Auden, Ashbery, Mathews, Brion Gysin, and many many others.  What brought them all to France, especially Paris?<br />Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno's account of American expatriates in France reads like a novel.  He enters the minds and hearts of the various authors - their inner thoughts and motivations - in a seemingly effortless narrative, drawing on a vast scholarship.  He has read all of their works and letters as well as news and magazine articles of the times.  Gertrude Stein was thought to be peculiarly anti-semitic as she sided with the Vichy government, the irascible Hemingway had a vendetta against James Jones (author of *From Here to Eternity*) and Richard Wright noted that &quot;I've learned more about America in one month in Paris than I could in one year in New York.&quot;  In addition to chronicling little-known facts and anecdotes about the first wave, the author continues the saga with later writers.<br />He covers all kinds of writing.  A most interesting chapter deals with an obscure (in America) experimental French author, Roussel, and the American writers influenced by him - Ashbery, Mathews, Burroughs, Koch.  They reinvented what the Dadaists had begun 40 years earlier, a turning of images in cinematic variation, a &quot;systematic derangement of the senses.&quot;<br />Paris is &quot;artistically electric&quot; they agree.  Racial prejudice isn't afactor in France (except for the French treatment of the Algerians) but only Baldwin seems to have been upset by this.  Where but in France could Ferlinghetti wander into a cafe and find a paper tablecloth with a poem written on it, (signed by Jacques Prevert).  &quot;For Ferlinghetti, this was the France of which the legends had been made.  On leaving the cafe, he took the tablecloth with him.  The incident was prophetic.  Fourteen years later, City Lights [in San Francisco] would issue Ferlinghetti's translation of Prevert's 'Paroles'&quot;.<br />Where but in France would landlords lower the rent when they discovered that their tenants were writers or artists?  &quot;In short,&quot; says this author, &quot;Paris empowered, granted permission to be an artist in a way the United States never had.  In the accounts of almost all of the writers profiled in this book, Paris was equated with artistic freedom, with the ability to experiment, to succeed, even to fail, without feeling oneself to be a social deviant [while] In America, they felt, one was more often measured by how financially successful one was, not by what one actually did.  Status accrued to those who made money, and the writer, generally not so able to generate an enviable income, was rarely accorded a position of importance in the eyes of the general public.&quot;<br />Said Ginsberg, &quot;You can't escape the past in Paris, and yet what's so wonderful about it is that the past and present intermingle so intangibly that it doesn't seem a burden.&quot;  Indeed, Paris allowed &quot;la grande permission&quot; for writers &quot;to work out their own aesthetic directions without being unduly swayed by convention, anti-convention or fashion.&quot;<br />This is not, in my opinion, one of those books that you can't put down.  There is so much material here to digest and ponder.  But if you're interested in the subject, even though it may take you weeks or even months, you will keep picking it up.  The only question I have on finishing it is - the continual pilgrimage -is it still continuing?  And if not, why not?<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-12-19
US	49869538	R3TGTFROF4WBBL	0938317504	209985364	Scrapbook of a Taos Hippie: Tribal Tales from the Heart of a Cultural Revolution	Books	5	34	37	N	N	A Valuable Historical Chronicle	About half way through this book, I got the bright idea of listing all the people mentioned in it that I knew personally, had met, or knew of.  When the number reached 50, I stopped counting.  It's easier to count the people in it that I DON'T know - on the fingers of one hand.  Three of my oldest and dearest friends are featured here, one pictured on the cover.  So I can't be unbiased and objective about these &quot;tribal tales from the heart of a cultural revolution.&quot;  I've lived them and loved them, so for me, it's a manifesto.<br />It enters you into a movie of life in those days around Taos.  A rainbow of different voices speak.  And the voiceover of the narrator is sure and true.  Most delightful to me was remembering things I'd all but forgotten - like the Oriental Blue Streaks (a band), Da Nahazli (a hip school), Old Martinez Hall (a place, and the summer solstice at New Buffalo (a happening).  Here in these pages, I've found people and places I haven't thought about for a long time - Feather, Preacher, Pabla, Teddy the Juggler, Hotsy Totsy, the Stragecoach Hot Springs, the General Store, peyote meetings on the mesa, Little Joe and Henry Gomez.  It all comes back in color and glory and story and song, and it's food for the heart.<br />&quot;I was always on the hunt for a mythological explanation of the world,&quot; says Keltz.  &quot;We were reverting to an old form - tribalism - but in a very new way.  We would not be a tribe because of lineage, race, language, or tradition.  We were a rainbow of people becoming a tribe because we had a collective belief in an alternative to materialism, greed, military power and an unpopular war fought using our brothers, schoolmates and boyfriends.&quot;<br />Not that there weren't some down times, hard times, foolish mistakes and even dangerous blunders.  The author makes that clear.  We were feeling our way, making it up as we went along.   It was colored funny and fun and scary and serious.  We knew that the onlyway to change the world was to change ourselves first.  And we did that.  None of us who lived through those times are the same people today.  <br />I did catch some inaccuracies - but those are all in the memories of individual voices here.  None of them are egregious errors or deliberate slights or misrepresentations as those often found in other chronicles of this time.  Somebody said, &quot;If you remember the '60s, you weren't there.&quot;<br />When you're living the life from day to day, it can seem ordinary.  You chop wood and haul water, you cook oatmeal for the kids, you gather watercress and rose hips by the rio, but when you step into the world of this book, and the author does her magic for you, the patina of years transforms it into a whole round thing - like a soap bubble in the sun.<br />I learned a lot about what I'd missed - the hippie New Mexico oracle, &quot;Fountain of Light&quot; and the hippie-made Bicentennial silver and gold concha belt that was worth many thousands (but priceless really) and destined for the Bicentennial 1978 exhibit at the Smithsonian - but was stolen.  I slept through all that but sure am glad to know about it now.  <br />There's no index in this, so you can't look up any nouns, but after reading the whole thing, I think I understand why Iris didn't do an index.  The story, the saga, is greater than its individual parts and greater than the sum of its parts.<br />Says Keltz, &quot;We were the critical mass that could change the direction of our capitalistic society&quot; and, &quot;...we were unafraid of our inconsistencies, a people who embraced paradox as the slippery road to a glorious future.&quot;<br />Friends who have this scrapbook have told me that they skipped around, reading only about themselves and their friends, but I recommend doing as the White King advises.  &quot;Begin at the beginning; go right on until you come to the end; then stop.&quot;  That way, you know what to go back to and look at again - photos, drawings, dialogue - whatever.  Even if you don't know a single person, place or idea in this book, I believe the work stands on its own merits as a valuable historical chronicle.  Sounds like marbles rolling, doesn't it?  Rolling through this scrapbook, this album, this experience.  Splendid stuff.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-12-15
US	49869538	R21BHS52DWG4ZD	0812551613	891882719	Earth Made of Glass (Giraut)	Books	4	2	5	N	N	Isosemiotic Epistemes	Even though some of us SF fans (myself included) believe the genre is coming into its own as a true literary form, I think most of us mainly read the stuff because it's our favorite escape literature, and we think it's the best.  That's why it's somewhat peculiar (and somewhat funny) that *Earth Made of Glass* sent me to the dictionary to look up &quot;isosemiotic episteme.&quot;  Sounds too much like WORK!  It takes effort just to say isosemiotic episteme three times in a row. Repeat after me...<br />Barnes says, &quot;In that era of formalization and intensification, it had been thought that all cultures would want to develop separately, each in its own isosemiotic episteme.&quot;  Well &quot;isosemiotic&quot; is not in the dictionary, but the &quot;iso&quot; prefix refers to isolation (duh!) &quot;semiotic&quot; pertains to the study of signs and symbols (or symptoms of diseases), and &quot;episteme&quot; is a piece of knowledge - a piece of valid information.  So, um, I guess that means tending toward an isolationist collection of the memes of culture and getting stuck in the amber of rigid thought forms.<br />Some of those memes are totally bogus for both the Tamils and Mayas since both were &quot;created&quot; cultures sent out from Earth (not the originals).  The new Maya prophet, Ix, gives them both three principles, namely, stop taking your sacred texts literally and hurting other people over them; secondly, &quot;...exclude nothing, bring all things in&quot; and thirdly &quot;set a boundary now and forever between what is true everywhere and for everyone, and what is true for our time and place,&quot; i.e. they are to give up their strangle hold on their isosemiotic epistemes.<br />I like a lot of things about this book.  I liked it that in Ix, we get a whiff of the true prophets down through the ages.  He's a maverick, a wild card.  They all are.  Everybody knows that Jesus wouldn't be considered &quot;respectable&quot; around here.<br />I like it that Giraut's wife, Margaret, is extremely unattractive, yet he loves her. He marries her. (I kept expecting Margaret to get a workover, but she never did.)  Nowhere have I ever heard of a female protagonist who is altogether ugly, yet beloved.  This has got to be a first.<br />I like the way the author switches voices from narrative to dialogue.  Very smooth.  I like it that he describes what a different planet looks and feels like.  The blinding dot of their sun &quot;was ringed by a circle of blue that quickly faded into the uniform deep indigo.&quot;  The black sky created deep shadows and sharper contrasts.  I love to picture stuff like this, and there's quite a bit of it here.  Real science fiction.<br />I like the little cultural anthropological pointers scattered throughout the novel, such as &quot;...you had to learn a culture until you knew whether the person on the other side of the table was following a cultural norm different from yours, or just an asshole.&quot;<br />And I like it that Barnes reminds me of Chad Oliver, an old timey SF writer who dealt with anthropological/archeological themes.  Wasn't really disappointed with the ending - merely surprised - which is in itself food for thought.<br />Absolutely the only thing I didn't like (other than Margaret's non-makeover and not understanding the title) was the author's grammatical gaffs, such as, &quot;...things that don't matter at all to you or I&quot; instead of &quot;you or me.&quot;  The first reviewer on this site noticed it, so I'm not the lone ranger.  A good copyeditor would have picked that up in a hot New York second.<br />These two books cry out to be a trilogy.  We want to know about the ancient aliens who left archeological traces of themselves all over the galaxy and produced a high technology but no books.  And how about a makeover for Margaret?<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-11-20
US	49869538	R2HJXPY1SJLHFV	0878422099	919996263	Roadside Geology of New Mexico (Roadside Geology Series)	Books	5	39	40	N	N	Answers to all your questions	Over the years, I have been saving up pictures and memories of geologic curiosities in New Mexico. I had meant to ask a geologist and/or look up books on the subject, but never quite got around to it.  When we lived in Taos, I wanted to know more about the geological ages evidenced in the rock layers at the Rio Grande Gorge bridge.  When we lived in Los Alamos, I was fascinated by the sculptured sandstone pinnacles in the canyon lands that look man made (but are not).  When we lived in Santa Fe and environs, I wanted to know how climate and human interaction had altered the land and what the countryside must have looked like to ancient Indian peoples in that place.  And now that we're living between Grants and Gallup, I'm most interested in the lava flow of the Malpais region.  This author says that &quot;The youngest flow is less than 1,000 years old and may figure in Indian legends as 'fire rock' that buried the fields of Indian ancestors.&quot;  To the East is Mt. Taylor, an &quot;eroded composite volcano.&quot;<br />So it's all here - the answers to all my questions and more - with photographs and diagrams and history.  It covers all of New Mexico and into the states it touches - Arizona, Colorado and Texas (as well as the four corners region going into Utah).  From Precambrian to Quarternary ages, from ancient flood plains and the Rio Grande rift to mountain rock glaciers and the Palisades, it's all here in this little gem of a book.<br />A perfect resource to accompany you when you're touring New Mexico either on the main highways or off the beaten track, you can go as deeply into the geology of the area you're seeing as you want or simply check out what type of rock you're looking at.  *Roadside Geology of New Mexico* by Halka Chronic is exactly what I was looking for in one compact volume, and I'm most please to have discovered it.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-11-19
US	49869538	RQCW9SF953X5L	0812516338	550073564	A Million Open Doors	Books	4	1	2	N	N	A Meeting of Minds	In its early years, science fiction used to be mostly &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; clearly distinguishing it from &quot;sword and sorcery,&quot; but increasingly, we see SF novels that have all but abandoned the hard-science base as a focus.  The physics and engineering of space travel, for example, is merely a given; the culture of other planets and species are the focus instead.  Thus the &quot;soft&quot; sciences, such as archeology, anthropology and sociology come into play, but these novels are clearly real science fiction.<br />In this book, two planetary cultures meet.  One is terraformed and one is not (but it turns out in an interesting little twist, that both have been terraformed, one anciently, so this segues nicely into the sequel).  One is romantic, flamboyant, but violent, while the other is peaceful, but ideologically restrictive.  In other words, there is a great deal that is wrong with each culture, but there is also a great deal that is right about each.  The coming together of these two cultures and the way both are improved by the contact is the theme of this novel.  The parallels between *A Million Open Doors* and Heinlein's *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress* are obvious, but I don't think this author is as heavy-handed and didactic as Heinlein (although the latter is funnier and, it may be argued, more entertaining than Barnes).  I am more reminded in this work, because of its subtlety and in-depth psychological observations, of Ursula LeGuin's *The Dispossessed.*<br />This is the first Barnes novel I've read, and I'm pleased to have discovered him and looking forward to the sequel, *Earth Made of Glass.*  A good read.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-11-12

They had a sustainable traditional economy based on trade and cooperation - not money.  One person's gain was not another person's loss.  There was plenty of leisure, no hunger or poverty, very little sickness or disease, everyone was valued, there was no pollution and nothing was wasted.  They got along fine with their Muslim neighbors and they kept their population stable through marriage customs based on land use.  Almost every family had a celibate monk or nun.  Buddhist monasteries and people had a mutually beneficial economic, social and spiritual relationship.  Ladakhis are a naturally contemplative people with a great deal of spiritual awareness.  &quot;Schon chan&quot; (one who angers easily) is about the only insult in the Ladakhi lnaguage.  &quot;Lack of pride is a virtue, for pride, born of ego, has nothing to do with self-respect among these Buddhist people.&quot;  The author says that it took her two years of living among them to realize that the people were genuinely and joyfully HAPPY.  Then the world beat a path to their door and all that changed - in fewer than two decades.<br />It's like a little piece of cultural time-lapse photography.  What took western culture more than four centuries to do to the Native-Americans took only twenty years here.  Ladakh has become a cautionary tale and a monument to western greed and stupidity.<br />Now there is poverty and unemployment, stress-related disease, women are devalued, the people are ashamed of their &quot;backward&quot; culture, there is little leisure but a great deal of pollution and waste as well as dispute between Muslims and Buddhists and the population had increased markedly.  (&quot;Interestingly, a number of Ladakhis have linked the rise of birth rates to the advent of modern democracy.  &quot;Power is a question of votes&quot; is a current slogan, meaning that, in the modern sector, the larger your group, the greater your access to power.  Competition for jobs and political representation within the new centralized structures is increasingly dividing Ladakhis.&quot;)<br />Chiildren are trained to become specialists in a technological rather than an ecological society.  They no longer have time to learn the superb survival techniques of their families.  Western culture is creating artificial scarsity and inducing competition.<br />Now I understand the mechanism better.  A culture that has a heavily subsidized infrastructure invades a traditional self-sustaining culture and creates artificial &quot;needs.&quot;  So they go to the city to earn money which they never needed before, leaving their farms and women, who are immediately devalued because they're not wage earners.  The people are no longer planting, irrigating, spinning wool, gathering seeds, harvesting, playing music and singing and telling stories, having seasonal parties, marriage parties or funeral watches - together.<br />Time has become a commodity.  It has become uneconomical to grow one's own food, make one's own clothes and build one's own house.  You have to pay your neighbors for the work that the whole community used to do for free.<br />The men are in the cities earning money and the women are producing tourist commodities with the wool they used to spin for their own use and the food they used to grow for their own families.  Now they grow cash crops for strangers so they can make enough money to buy polyester clothes and walkmans and jeans for their kids and food grown hundreds of miles away and fuel trucked in from afar.<br />The Yak and the Dzo, uniquely suited for high altitudes of Ladakh gave rich milk but not as much as western cattle.  So what did the conquering culture do?  They imported cattle that can't make it at such altitudes, so more land has to be relegated to planting crops to feed the cattle, thereby upsetting the balance.  And they call this progress.<br />Why can't we just leave people alone - especially when they're doing FINE without us?<br />&quot;When one-third of the world's population consumes two-thirds of the world's resources,&quot; says Norberg-Hodge, &quot;and then in effect turns around and tells the others to do as they do, it is little short of a hoax.  Development is all too often a euphemism for exploitation, a new colonialism.&quot;<br />All this would be a dismal tragedy comparable to Columbus's complete genocide of the Tainos if not for a &quot;counter development&quot; movement generated in part by this author.  Since the Ladakhis can't go back, they can at least go forward.  Instead of importing expensive fossil fuels (previously they had used yak dung and kept warm) they can have solar houses and greenhouses, which have worked very well and given them one benefit that they have previously not had.  That's something.  Information is another plus.  The people are being made aware that westerners pay more for whole grains, organic vegetables, pure water, natural fibers, and natural building materials - things these people have had for a thousand years without money.  This is something so-called third-world people are generally not told about.<br />Once in a while a book comes along that changes one's perspective forever.  *Ancient Futures* is such a book.  I haven't been the same since.<br />One of the reviewers on this site said he ended up buy copies for his friends.  So have I.  This book is a must-read for every person who is concerned about the preservation of our planet and our species.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-10-24
US	49869538	R2VCB22UCAYUZ5	0698101340	590705141	Getting Back Together.	Books	1	5	8	N	N	Sloppy, Inaccurate and Misleading	Had I had no previous knowledge or personal experience with the communes and people mentioned in this book, I would have thought the author had done a fine job of not only reporting on but also participating in communal life.  Houriet has impressive narrative skills and some of his personal observations (both positive and negative) seem valid and interesting.  But since I do have knowledge and experience of many of these communes and people, I am dismayed and disappointed with this &quot;off the bus&quot; report.<br />Houriet devotes considerable space to his stay at New Buffalo (in New Mexico) and right from the beginning the inaccuracies are evident.  He says the elevation of Santa Fe is 1,000 feet when in fact it is 7,000 ft. (the capital city with the highest elevation in the country; Denver is only 5,000 ft.).  He calls vigas &quot;vertigas&quot; and latillas &quot;lotillas&quot; and says the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are west of Arroyo Hondo (near New Buffalo) when in fact, they are in the East.  He says that Santo Domingo Pueblo was one of the few inhabited pueblos left in the state.  Not true.  There's Taos, Isleta, Santa Clara, Laguna, Zuni, Acoma...just to name a few.  A quick check of an encyclopedia would have set him straight, but he didn't bother.  Irritatingly, he repeats these sloppy mistakes over and over.  Unlike Tim Miller in *The 60s Communes* and *Hippies and American Values*, Houriet hasn't done his homework.<br />He shouldn't have changed some names and not others.  He should have either changed them all or reported them accurately.  Jane became &quot;Mary&quot; and her child, Sarah, became &quot;Nancy.&quot;  Joanne became Joanna while George and Joyce Robinson and Cowboy Bob at Buffalo, Byron and Jason at Morningstar and Jasper and Max at Reality Construction Co. retained their true names.  Cave Dave became &quot;Cave David.&quot;  Apparently Houriet didn't get it that Dave was called &quot;Cave Dave&quot; because it rhymes.<br />These inaccuracies may seem unimportant, but when this author makes up incidents of violence out of whole cloth (like something from &quot;Easy Rider&quot;), the falsities become more seriously misleading. He has a reporter's instinct about what kind of material sells books but he doesn't seem to worry overmuch about telling the truth.  When you find fabrications and inaccuracies in the parts you know about, how can you trust the rest of it?<br />Reporting on his one peyote meeting (at Morningstar - a couple miles from New Buffalo) he got his facts hopelessly confused.  The water bird became a &quot;mourning dove&quot; and the dried cedar used as an incense sacrament became &quot;cedar berries.&quot;  He misreported the Indians and Hippies there and what they said (I know; I was there).  The mistakes and misrepresentations involving Buffalo, Morningstar and Reality are too numerous to mention further.<br />Houriet's interview with Lou Gottlieb at the California Morningstar, however, as well as his conversations with Justin at Buffalo, sound authentic, but that was probably due to the unique personalities of these men coming through despite the author's embellishments and falsifications.<br />Similarly, I don't find as many breathtaking fabrications in his accounts of Libre and Lama (but that may be because I didn't live at either of these places - just visited and knew people from them).<br />Houriet only mentions The Farm (at Summertown Tennessee) in a footnote and he makes three mistakes in that footnote.  This omission is odd because in his travels, the author was fairly near The Farm.  It's one of the oldest and most successful of the Hippie communes and in fact, it is still going on today.  It has produced doctors, lawyers, a school, a publishing company and several businesses and charitable organizations.  Perhaps Farmies saw Houriet coming, knew he was likely to misrepresent them, and gave his his walking papers.  We'll never know.<br />Most people I've talked to who have read *Getting Back Together* clearly recognize that the author had his own agenda.  What they may not have realized is that the book has been through at least two editions and thousands of people must have read it and believed it.<br />In my opinion, this book is worse than worthless because it can't be trusted.

The jacket blurb says &quot;nature/Southwest literature&quot;.  But Annie Dillard did this in the Northeast and Edward Abbey did it all over the Southwest and down rivers.  Everett Ruess and Ann Zwinger did it in SE Utah with superb sketches and wood cuts.  C.L. Rawlins and Gretel Ehrlich do it in Wyoming with sketches and photographs.  Stanley Crawford did it with *Mayordomo* and *A Garlic Testament* a few miles SE of Tom Ireland in the Embudo Valley between Taos and Santa Fe (or halfway to Los Alamos - whichever way your crow flies).<br />&quot;People who bond with 'place' and then write about it with philosophical comments and profound/funny/zen-like observations along the way&quot; is a bit cumbersome.  These people out-Thoreau Thoreau (and I'm from Thoreau, New Mexico [heh heh]; I ought to know).  All these authors (and more) do this thing superbly well, in their own unique voices, but all the same, the genre deserves a better name than &quot;nature/Southwest&quot; or &quot;nature/Northeast.&quot;<br />Ireland has added a new dimension with Angie Coleman's joyful paintings of exactly this same country round about.  [I've debated about extracting and framing these paintings - still debating.  Think I'll have to buy another copy of the book.]<br />This author reproduces his encounters with his Spanish and Indian neighbors (sometimes poignant, somtimes frustrating, always funny).  These little essays/vignettes stand by themselves, but at the very end, the writer includes a story about La Pascualita - a real person who sweeps the roads with her broom and is housed and adopted by the entire community of La Madera.  Ireland weaves her into a story that is reminiscent of Rudolfo Anaya, but very much his own.<br />And his piece about Magdalena, the magpie he adopted, is an original for sure.<br />&quot;Walking around with a bird on your head is like watching life from a tenement window.&quot; &quot;What's the collective noun for magpies?  How about 'complaint'?  There's a complaint of magpies in a cottonwood on the hillside across the river.&quot;<br />He watches the ravens of La Junta:  &quot;I was still standing there when the raven blew up over the cliff and almost into my face.  It must have scared him almost as much as it scared me, to be riding the blast sixty feet off the ground and then all of a sudden to be facing a man.  He shat, climbed up over the reach of harm, and held there at the closest safe distance to look again, reassembling his world into the kind of order he trusted it to have.  (Ravens up.  Men down.)  Then he spoke.  It was a sort of rattle, as much from the bowel as from the throat, and in it there was both fear and outrage:  'This cliff is taken.  You are not wanted here.'  He drifted north, riding the thermal, checking to see if there were any more of me around, then fell up and away into the bottomless sky.&quot;<br />About roosters:  &quot;...their voices make me think of the smell of joss sticks because *things mean things:&quot; the rooster means incense, and the helicopter means searching the river for the body of a dead man, and I deceive myself that at eight o'clock this morning the real work will begin.  Things mean things: the substance of faith, what we live for, those meanings, those coincidences of sky &amp; rain &amp; thought that jump at us.&quot;<br />He makes you feel like you're perching on his shoulder, looking through his eyes, seeing what he sees, hearing what he hears, and understanding through his mind and heart.<br />&quot;Towards evening, the sun dropped into a corridor between the clouds and the little valley was filled with pink light.  I put down my shovel and stood under a juniper to witness the change.  It was like being in an aquarium: immersed, the bare cottonwoods, the hillside, the vacant house across the river, the fence posts, my own hands acquired a light of their own.  The air filled with sugary spines of ice, and a rainbow appeared, its northern pole planted in the willows of a neighbor's cow pasture.  I could see impossible distances in every direction; up the valley to La Zorra, down the crooked Valleciros, up the canada behind Vigil's store - as if I could see around corners.&quot;<br />All through these reflections are little personal musings:<br />&quot;What is it about the presence of parents that makes us feel something less than alive, when they're the ones responsible for bringing us here in the first place?&quot;<br />About dreams and water:  &quot;To wake in the dark and peel off the skin of your dream:  to go out in the dark in the wet yard where drops of water hang from the asparagus berries and the night sounds are swamp sounds, sounds of water.  And this our dry land smells like water and the creek runs brown.&quot;<br />And about work:  &quot;Ulceration of the spirit.  It seems that when I have a job, my life becomes the job and not much else.  There is no true rest and no true work until it's over.&quot;<br />&quot;...we have made our joy depend on our work, and having come this far, we can't renounce it, can't be free from it, but only look for freedom in it.&quot;<br />&quot;When I stand outside watching the clouds and the birds, I'm doing my work.  These things need to be studied and praised, at least reported on.&quot;<br />And report he does.  The title of the book comes from a quote by Malcolm Lowry, &quot;You cannot prevent the birds of sorrow from flying over your head, but you can prevent them from building a nest in your hair.&quot;<br />This is a beautiful little gem of a book with lovely paintings, anecdotes and musings - the kind of book to keep by your bed and pick up and read at random.  It's also a book to read all the way through from the beginning - more than once.  In a word - delight.  Five stars - easy.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-09-22

They are right up there with Ursula LeGuin, Orson Scott Card,  Theodore Sturgeon and Robert Silverberg.  But while I've always loved  Zelazny, I've had an almost visceral reaction to the works of Philip K.  Dick.  His stuff strikes me as a particularly bad acid trip and it's  usually so depressing that it's hard to get through (even though I do  recognize his merits as a writer).  But Zelazny seems to have tempered this  tendency in Dick and Dick has added some depth, spice and kick to the  Zelazny passages. They're both funny writers, and I sure would like to have  been a fly on the wall when they cooked this one up.  I'm frankly puzzled  as to how these two even got the idea of collaborating, but nevertheless,  *Deus Irae* seems to have been a marriage made in heaven - and consummated  in hell.  <br />I won't reiterate the plot except to note that in this  post-holocaust world of mutants and cyborgs, the man who gave the bomb  order, instead of being vilified, is deified.  It is he who is the Deus  Irae.<br />There's a fair amount of theological banter that was probably the  fruit of the authors' conversations, such as this passage where the Deus  Irae himself (in disguise) is talking.   &quot;I see.  Aquinas cleaned up  the Greeks for you, so Plato is okay.  Hell, you even baptized Aristotle's  bones, for that matter, once you found a use for his thoughts.  Take away  the Greek logicians and the Jewish mystics and you wouldn't have much  left.&quot;<br />I'm sure that the gut-wrenching, stomach-turning parts were  Dick's brainchild, while the lyrical human-interaction passages were  written by Zelazny.  But somehow it all bakes into a cake, is witty and  entertaining, and even has a happy ending - sort of.<br />You may like it; you  may hate it, but it's NOT a pot boiler and it IS well  written.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-09-18
US	49869538	R3HWLT9Z6XJGAO	081120586X	815352086	My Argument with the Gestapo: Autobiographical novel	Books	4	25	26	N	N	Gonzo Journalism of the '40s	The jacket blurb and publisher's note call this a macaronic journal.  The  word &quot;macaronic&quot; sent me to the dictionary where I found that it  refers to a mixture of languages usually to comic effect (now I finally  understand the lyrics of &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;).  So if you read this  novel, don't make the mistake of skipping over the French, Spanish, German  and Italian passages.  They're jumbled up with English phrases in a kind of  comic patois so that you can get the gist.<br />*My Argument With the  Gestapo*, originally entitled, *My Escape from the Nazis* is about an  imaginary trip to London and France when WW II was just getting started  (before Pearl Harbor).  The Nazi atrocities had not yet come to light when  Merton wrote it, but the book was oddly prophetic.  It is dreamlike and  playful, sophisticated and airy, but the message is serious.  We can't  blame any one person or people for war.  War is a condition in our own  individual hearts.  The book reminds me a bit of the French  existentialists, Camus and Sartre, and reads at times like an avant garde  play by Albee or Ionesco with its surreal dialogue.  But it's too socially  conscious to be Kafkaesque.  It presages Merton's deep commitment to and  involvement with the peace movement of the '60s.  In fact, it must be the  gonzo journalism of the '40s.<br />Merton was so intelligent and talented that  he could have written the score, lyrics and dialogue for a Broadway musical  (and drawn the posters for it into the bargain - I've seen some of his  drawings) but soon after he wrote this piece, he became a Trappist monk for  30 years.  It's amazing that such a hip and sophisticated work could have  come from the pen of a 26-year-old postulant.<br />If you've ever read  Merton's autobiography, *The Seven Storey Mountain*, you will recognize the  autobiographical material here.  In fact, the author names himself as the  main protagonist.<br />I doubt if I would have read this book were it notfor  the fact that Thomas Merton wrote it.  As far as I know, this is his only  published novel written before he entered the Abbey of Gethsemani in 1941  and only published after his death in 1968.  Merton says it was &quot;...a  kind of sardonic meditation on the world in which I then found myself: an  attempt to define its predicament and my own place in it.&quot;<br />Maybe  someday somebody will write an annotated version of *Gestapo*, but until  then, the novel stands on its own merits and is, in my opinion, well worth  reading.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-09-13

These are on Religious Experience and Social Concerns.   Merton was truly all things to all people, but through it all, he is still  completely himself.  His unique voice is evident in all his correspondence  where he is by turns serious and funny, kind and generous.  Some of these  letters read like essays.  Some are anecdotal.  All are entertaining.   <br />His correspondents included Dorothy Day and Daniel Berrigan, Erich Fromm  and Aldous Huxley, two Popes, Ethel Kennedy, Coretta King - the list is  staggering.  He wrote to Christians and Jews, Buddhists and Hindus and  Sufis, social activits and theologians, men and women.  He wrote about  contemplation and pacifism, literature and psychology.  He had friends in  all walks of life, and he was beloved by all.<br />This is a book to browse in  and/or study, highly recommended to all admirers and students of Merton's  thought and life.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-09-06
US	49869538	RJE8ML9KEM7V6	0802803040	92329213	The Parables of Grace	Books	5	10	10	N	N	The Modus Operandi of Grace	So you thought you knew and understood the parables of Jesus? Take another look - specifically at Robert Farrar Capon's superb trilogy on the parables  of the Kingdom, Grace and Judgment.  Guaranteed to rattle your theological  bird cage.  In this volume on the Grace parables (in which the author again  deals with lastness, leastness, lostness, littleness, left-handed images,  death and resurrection, in such parables as the Lost Sheep, the Prodigal  Son, and the Good Samaritan, among others), he tackles the hardest parable  of all - the Unjust Steward in Luke 16.<br />I've always checked every book of  Bible commentary to see what the author has to say about this parable, and  so far, only Father Capon has come up with anything that makes sense to me.   He says the unjust steward was wasting (diaskorpizon) his Lord's money.   &quot;Diaskorpizon&quot; is the same Greek word used for the Prodigal Son's  wasting of his &quot;substance.&quot;  That's a clue, according to Capon,  that this is a grace and not a morality parable.  This is also like the  parable of the Unforgiving Servant except that it's reversed.  Forgiveness  starts from the bottom up instead of from the top down.  It's the Steward  who forgives the debt, and so he is a &quot;dead ringer for Jesus  himself.&quot;  <br />He dies (to his bookkeeping) raises others (forgives  their debts), but most important of all, &quot;...the unjust steward is the  Christ-figure because he is a crook, like Jesus.  The unique contribution  of this parable to our understanding of Jesus is its insistence that grace  cannot come to the world through respectability.  Respectability regards  only life, success, winning; it will have no truck with the grace that  works by death and losing - which is the only kind of grace there is.&quot;   Jesus was &quot;...not respectable.  He broke the sabbath.  He consorted  with crooks.  And he dies as a criminal.&quot;  He did it to &quot;...catch  a world that respectability could only terrify and condemn.  He became sin  for us sinners, weak for us weaklings, lost for us losers, and dead for us  dead.&quot;<br />For my money, Father Capon is the only Christian writer since  C.S. Lewis and Thomas Merton who has a clue about the true dynamics of the  faith.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-08-26
US	49869538	R13MKAE3REUQY6	0877935769	136381821	Merton: An Enneagram Profile	Books	4	24	24	N	N	An Epiphany for 4s	Recently, I became interested in enneagram theory.  Briefly, it is a  sophisticated ancient system for identifying the nine basic life scripts -  your practical/psychological/spiritual stance in life - how you cope - your  perceptions - what you tell yourself about reality.  There are nine of them  (like the nine muses) - nine kinds of human energy (a 9 isn't better or  higher than a 1.  The numbers form triads of interrelationship).  So after  investigating the system, I had decided I must be a 4, but pretty much lost  interest in the whole thing.  It can nail down your personality type all  right, but for the most part, what I had read didn't tell me what to do  about it, i.e. how to grow and improve.<br />Since Thomas Merton is one of my  all-time favorite authors, I was surprised and pleased to discover this  book that claims that Merton was also a 4, especially since, as the author  claims, &quot;Spiritual mentors come, of course, from all nine of these  gestures in life.  This being so, it can prove helpful along the way of  conversion and more contemplative living for us to find guides who  emphasize what is relevant for our own worldview or life stance.  In some  ways we all do just that through trial and error.  What enneagram study can  facilitate is a more informed search.  If it accomplishes this, then people  who want to live their life more fully...will avoid the cul-de-sacs that  contradict their personalities and slow down spiritual  transformation.&quot;<br />Zuercher points out that Merton's theme of human  journey was moving from a false to a true self.  &quot;We need to get off  our personal stage and stay out of our personal audience.  This is a theme  2/3/4s can readily identify with.  That being so, they are probably the  ones who most find Merton a helpful mentor.&quot;  Exactly so.<br />If you are  a Thomas Merton fan, you'll enjoy this book whether or not you've ever  heard of enneagrams.  If you're interested in an in-depth study of  enneagrams but have never heard of Merton, you'll be edified by this  investigation.  If you're a 4 and also a Merton fan, you'll love it.  If  you couldn't care less about any of this, you're probably not reading this  review anyway.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-08-22
US	49869538	R35GMJOAJWV12U	0786223251	198870493	Pilgrim at Tinker Creek	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Reverence in Irreverence	This book is a fine liqueur to be cherished and savored and relished and  sipped.  Like Annie Dillard, I am a creekside person, and *Pilgrim* lived  in my backpack for many months.  But since that old paperback is dogeared  and thermos-coffee stained, it's nice to have a new large-print edition  that is easier on eyes that are no longer quite as sharp but just as hungry  for these words.  <br />It seems to me that this is a book about being a  witness to creation.  &quot;...[B]eauty and grace are performed whether or  not we will or sense them.  The least we can do is try to be there.&quot;   Ah yes.  The very least that we can do is show up for the show, que  no?<br />From the author's discovery of the &quot;tree with lights&quot; to  her realization that &quot;Everything that has already happened is  particles, everything in the future is waves&quot; she treks up and down  Tinker Creek looking for evidence of his presence.  But absence of evidence  is not evidence of absence.  In fact, he is everywhere.  &quot;...this is  it, this is it&quot; she crows, &quot;praise the lord; praise the land.   Experiencing the present purely is being emptied and hollow; you catch  grace as a man fills his cup under a waterfall.&quot;  but, on the other  hand, &quot;You don't run down the present, pursue it with baited hooks and  nets.  You wait for it, empty-handed, and you are filled.  You'll have fish  left over.  The creek is the one great giver...This old rock planet gets  the present for a present on its birthday every day.&quot;<br />The author  inductively reasons from the biological, psychological and artistic real  world to what God must be like.  She treks around the creek, examining the  flora and fauna of the creator's creation and the flora and fauna of human  consciousness looking for him - looking for clues to his actual character.   &quot;The question from agnosticism,&quot; says Annie, &quot;is, Who turned  on the lights?  The question from faith is, Whatever  for?&quot;<br />&quot;Look again at the horsehair worm,&quot; she says,  describing each form in more intricacy than I'm quoting here, &quot;...an  overwintering ball of fuzzing bees...a turtle under ice...the fruit of the  Osage orange tree...convoluted as any human brain...at a rotifer...Look in  short, at practically anything - the coot's feet, the mantis's face, a  banana, the human ear - and see that not only did the creator create  everything but that he is apt to create ANYTHING.  He'll stop at  nothing.<br />&quot;There is no one standing over evolution with a blue pencil  to say, 'Now that one, there, is absolutely ridiculous, and I won't have  it.'  If the creature makes it, it gets a 'stet.'  Is our taste so much  better than the creator's?  Utility to the creature is evolution's only  aesthetic consideration.  Form follows function in the created word, so far  as I know, and the creature that functions, however bizarre, survives to  perpetuate its form.  Of the intricacy of form, I know some answers and not  others:  I know why the barbules on a feather hook together, and why the  Henle's loop loops, but not why the elm tree's leaves zigzag, or why  butterfly scales and pollen are shaped just so.  but of the VARIETY of form  itself, of the multiplicity of forms, I know nothing.  Except that,  apparently, anything goes.  This holds for forms of behavior as well as  design - the mantis munching her mate, the frog wintering in mud, the  spider wrapping a hummingbird, the pin processionary straddling a thread.   Welcome aboard.  A generous spirit signs on this motley  crew.&quot;<br />&quot;...the creator creates.  Does he stoop, does he speak,  does he save, succor, prevail?  Maybe.  But he creates:  he creates  everything and anything.&quot; &quot;...Why so many forms?...The creator  goes off on one wild, specific tangent after another, or millions  simultaneously, with an exuberance that would seem to be unwarranted, and  with an abandoned energy sprung from an unfathomable font.  What is going  on here?&quot;  ...Freedom is the world's water and weather, the world's  nourishment freely given, its soil and sap:  the creator loves  pizzaz.&quot;<br />*Pilgrim at Tinker Creek* is exultant, exuberant, erudite  and elegant.  I'd call the whole thing a prose poem.  Dillard lets the left  brain know what the right brain is doing.  You can open the pages at any  point, read a passage, and CELEBRATE!  Not everyone can or wants to grok  it, but if it's food for you, it's a rare gem of a book for you.  You know  who you are.  I'd give it eight stars if eight were an  option.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-08-19

Lawyer, congressman from Minnesota, entrepreneur,  music and art lover - he may have been the only Congressman at the time to  use all his spare hours in Washington to explore the Library of Congress.   He was a prodigious, voracious and consummate scholar.  As a writer, he  became an instant success with *Atlantis:  The Antediluvian World*.  This  book was not, despite its title, some pseudo mystical bit of fluff.  He had  discovered physical evidence for the existence of the Golden Age (plants we  now call tropical flourished within the present Arctic Circle for instance)  as well as physical evidence for prehistoric cataclysm.  He theorized that  the earth's great deposits of sand, gravel and clay were not the result of  glacial movements but were produced by the debris of a comet passing close  to or striking the earth.  The Golden Age as well as the Great Cataclysm  (known in Scandinavia as Ragnarok) was remembered in myth and legend all  over the world.<br />Donnelly uncovered evidence that the drift was sudden,  the poles were not as they are now (&quot;some terrible shock displaced  them&quot;) and heat meeting cold caused a thick world-wide cloud cover   (which caused the subsequent ice age).  Modern science corroborates this -  the mammoths and all flora and fauna perished suddenly.  The sea boiled in  great fjords, rocks melted, and clay and gravel rained down from the sky.   A recent PBS documentary claimed it was either due to a comet or a  volcano.<br />Donnelly theorized that it was a comet.  He devotes a whole  chapter to comets and their nature, particularly the Biela comet as it  related to the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.  At the same moment in three  different states (Wisconsin, Michigan and Illinois) it was recorded that  peculiar and devastating fires broke out. Even though history books STILL  stick like fly paper to the Mrs.-O'Leary's-cow-kicked-a-lantern-in-the-barn  story, heat intense enough to melt tons of pig iron couldn't have been  caused by a barn fire.<br />Among other interesting conjectures, Donnelly  thought that the Americas were the true ancient world (which ties in nicely  with recent anthropological findings in North America proving quite  conclusively that paleoindians didn't all come over the Bering Strait from  Mongolia and Asia).  He dug up Indian legends about a great conflagration  and there is a fascinating passage about the book of Job being a chronicle  of the great catastrophe.<br />As Paul Allen says in his 1971 introduction to  the book, &quot;He took no 'leads' from other authors or authorities in his  investigation of these themes; he was a pioneer in the fullest and best  sense of the word.&quot;  This book is out of print now, but I bought it  from Amazon.com only three or four years ago.  Originally published in  1883, it is still worth reading in the 21st Century.  I vote for yet  another reprint.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-08-18
US	49869538	R3CDKU7H4E7ZW3	0802808522	708065431	Health, Money, and Love: And Why We Don't Enjoy Them	Books	5	20	20	N	N	Lightfully Enlightening	After reading the entire Bible more than once and almost all of Robert  Farrar Capon's books (a handful of those more than once), I have come to  the conclusion that Jesus and Father Capon have at least one salient  personalitiy trait in common - they both love to shock people - jar us out  of our complacency.<br />In this book, Capon's opening gambit is to declare  religion &quot;no fun&quot; (it's all creed, cult and conduct after all),  and that its bailiwick is a false parallel universe, that you can make a  religion of anything (especially health, money and love) and that  Christianity isn't a religion.  It's the end of religion because of free  grace and besides, &quot;...there is not a properly religious act in the  Christian 'religion'&quot;<br />&quot;Our confessions do not earn us  forgiveness:  we had it all along by Jesus' gift.  Our prayers do not con  God into being gracious:  he conned himself on the cross.  Our Eucharists  do not cause Jesus to show up in a place from which he was absent:  he is  already everywhere - in all the fullness of his reconciling work - before  the service starts.&quot;  And our baptisms!  Oh man, our baptisms  &quot;...do not divide the world into the saved (us, inside) and the lost  (them, outside).&quot;<br />But I'll try to just let you turn that corner of  this fertile valley yourself and not give away the punchline.  You should  get it from the Capon's mouth (definitely worth the ride).<br />But I could  give you a clue on the infrastructure.  Religion, you see,  &quot;...operates in a self-originated, parallel world rather than in the  world as originated by God&quot; (and as the author always reminds us,  there is no ontological evil).  Not only that, but the principal device by  which original sin works is religion.  If you think this is outrageous,  read the book and see what an open and shut case it really is.  Although  the author's style is light, bantering, direct and engaging all at once, he  doesn't say anything he says lightly.  Lightfully, but  not lightly.<br />My  favorite little crosshatch is his interpretation of the Book of Job.  Like  his take on Luke 16, the unjust steward, I think Capon's cake that he bakes  on his take is where it's at.<br />&quot;But the fact is,&quot; says Capon of  Job, &quot;...it is God in person who finally confronts Job - and that Job  is finally able to fall in love with God rather than with religion - is  what makes all the difference.&quot;<br />At the beginning, everybody (Job  included) is religious.  As a result of Job's afflictions, he falls out of  love with the system of control.  He loses his religion.  His so-called  friends spend 34 chapters pushing religion.  When God shows up, he speaks  only to Job, &quot;...because Job alone has finally gotten out of the  false, parallel universe and into the real one that God himself has  made.&quot;  And Job is vindicated.  And he gets sort of reimbursed  &quot;...just for accepting the real God of the real world rather than  conjuring with the gods of the parallel universe.&quot;<br />&quot;Do you  see?&quot; says the author, &quot;Job starts out in religion, but he ends  up in love...Getting rid of religion, therefore, is always the first step  back to love!  Given that, the love that draws everything home does all the  rest.&quot;<br />Vintage Capon.  This is the second time I've read this book,  and it's much mellowed from the first time around.  Highly recommended.  Read it.  You just might like it.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-08-13

Take a look  at Robert Farrar Capon's superb trilogy on the parables of the Kingdom,  Grace and Judgment and see if they don't rattle your theological bird cage  just a little.  This volume is on the parables of Grace.  The author again  deals with lastness, leastness, lostness, littleness, left-handed images,  death and resurrection, this time in such parables as the Lost Sheep, the  Prodigal Son, and the Good Samaritan, among others.  And he includes the  hardest parable of all - the Unjust Steward of Luke 16.<br />I've always  checked every book of Bible commentary to see what the author has to say  about this parable, and so far, only Father Capon has come up with anything  that makes sense to me.  He says the unjust steward was wasting  (diaskorpizon) his Lord's money.  &quot;Diaskorpizon&quot; is the same word  used for the Prodigal Son's wasting of his &quot;substance.&quot;  That's a  clue, according to Capon, that this is a grace and not a morality parable.   This is also like the parable of the Unforgiving Servant except that it's  reversed.  Forgiveness starts from the botom up instead of from the top  down.  It's the steward who forgives the debt (not the rich man or the  Lord), and so he is a &quot;dead ringer for Jesus Himself.&quot;  He dies  (to his bookkeeping) rises others (forgives their debts), but most  important of all, &quot;...the unjust steward is the Christ-figure because  he is a crook, like Jesus.&quot;<br />&quot;The unique contribution of this  parable to our understanding of Jesus,&quot; says Capon, &quot;is its  insistence that grace cannot come to the world through respectability.   Respectability regards only life, success, winning; it will have no truck  with the grace that works by death and losing - which is the only kind of  grace there is.&quot;  Jesus was &quot;...not respectable. He broke the  sabbath.  He consorted with crooks.  And he dies as a criminal.&quot;And  he did all this to &quot;...catch a world that respectability could only  terrify and condemn.  He became sin for us sinners, weak for us weaklings,  lost for us losers, and dead for us dead.&quot;<br />For my money, Father  Capon is the only writer since C.S. Lewis and Thomas Merton who has even a  clue about the true dynamics of the Christian Faith.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-08-08
US	49869538	RWQRB4K02SYP	0802847684	898719645	The Fingerprints of God: Tracking the Divine Suspect Through a History of Images	Books	4	49	52	N	N	Re-forming the Reformation	Father Capon has done it again!  He has given us food for thought with his own unique spin.  True, he makes points that he's already made in preceding  books - but in this one, he zeros in on the mistakes of some of the church  fathers and puts a name to it - &quot;transactionalism&quot; - the old  left-brain idea that one must contribute some kind of coin - sacrifice,  repentance, good works - whatever - to deserve the free gift of forgiveness  and grace given by God from the get-go to humanity.  The Reformation kicked  transactionalism out the front door, proclaiming salvation by grace,  through faith, (not works), but let it right back in the back door by  stipulating that faith was the current coin of the realm. <br />In his own  inimitable style, Father Capon has the Holy Spirit saying (in a dialogue  among the Trinity at the beginning of the book), &quot;They're going to  paint themselves into a corner and say that the unbaptized go to hell or  even that sins after Baptism make forgiveness flake off like a bad paint  job, and that unless Christians go to confession for a second coat before  they die, they'll go to hell too.  Oh sure.  We've also agreed on this  Reformation business where I convince them that nobody has to do anything  to be forgiven except trust the grace that Jesus has already given  everybody.  But give them a hundred years after that and they'll manage to  turn faith itself into a requirement for grace:  no faith, no forgiveness.   Out the window again goes the free gift we've given them once and for all;  and back in comes forgiveness as a deal that's good only as long as they  behave themselves.&quot;<br />The author goes on to explain how the great  church reformers such as Irenaeus, Athanasius. Luther, Calvin and  Melanchthon, while contributing invaluable insights essential to a true  reformation, still slipped in this pernicious transactionalism.   &quot;Human beings aren't afraid of accountability,&quot; says Capon's Holy  Spirit, &quot;they're crazy about it.  If they can't get credit for  themselves or dish out blame to others, they cry, 'Unfair!'&quot;<br />Father  Capon says he was originally planning to call the book *Re-forming the  Reformation* and I think that may have been a better title for it (a worthy  double entendre) because the book seems to hang together on the explication  of these wrong turns in Christendom better than it does on an exploration  of images.  The only time images take center stage is when the author is  talking about Literalism/Fundamentalism vs. Liberalism (turning the Bible  into a book of ethics and denying the mystery) and he says both views are  mistakes.  God can jolly well use any device he wants to tell the STORY of  scripture - images in poetry, hyperbole, allegory, parables, and yes, even  literalism - even though the latter is seldom employed.  So literalism is  madness and deconstructivist liberalism takes all the vital juice out of it  and who needs that?<br />The history of church thought that the author covers  is most valuable and enlightening, but I thought that the imaginary  dialogue with the church fathers toward the end of the book was a bit  pedantic and tedious. Most of the same points were made in an earlier  chapter.<br />But the burning question, to my mind, is - isn't the atonement  itself a transaction no matter how you slice it?  Just as C.S. Lewis says  that the fall of man didn't HAVE to happen, did the atonement HAVE to take  place?  What dark necessity required it?  Was it a god above and beyond or  behind the Father as the god of Destiny was behind and beyond and above  Zeus?  We find out what the atonement is NOT.  It's not a  &quot;ransom&quot; - a transaction between God and the devil; it's not a  task - a &quot;what&quot; that Jesus accomplished by fulfilling a  transactional bill of particulars; it's not even a &quot;bait and switch  scam perpetrated by God himself&quot; where &quot;the cross is a mousetrap  for the devil&quot; (although Capon seems to favor this interpretation  above the other two because it has a sense of humor).  But I'm still  scratching my head.  How ELSE to see the atonement except as SOME kind of  transaction?<br />To be fair to Capon, this was a burning question with me  long before I read *The Fingerprints of God*, but since his earlier books  (that little gem of Theodicy) *The Third Peacock* and the Parable books  (Parables of the Kingdom, Judgment and Grace) changed my life and outlook,  I was hoping this one would answer that question.  Who knows?  Maybe the  next one will.  In any case, Robert Farrar Capon's books are all and always  worth reading, in my opinion.  Read this one.  Read his others.  You won't  be disappointed.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-08-07

Mankind had been reduced to a fraction of its  population when the polar ice caps melted (the greenhouse effect bore  fruit).  The technological world was wiped out and became a legend that  only a few believed (the magic mirrors - TV; the self-propelled carriages  and flying machines - cars and airplanes).  But part of the legend is that  at every new millennium, mankind gets another chance, and there are rumors  of the Forthcoming of the White Bird of Dawning that will conquer the  Blackbird of Fear.  The Church Militant, however, is bent on keeping the  Blackbirds (the Falcons) in power. Hope arrives in the form of a young boy,  Tom, who has the power to stir the human mind with his magical music.   &quot;It was as though all the promise of life was twinkling inside him  like sunshine in a waterdrop...&quot; says a witness.  Asked what it is  that he does when he plays his pipes, Tom says, &quot;I join myself to  them.  I build a bridge and walk to them over it.  I take their thoughts  and give them back my own.&quot;  He makes people see the White Bird -  until he is martyred at York and there is nothing left but a lost testament  telling of the mysterious Bride of Time, the Bird of Dawning and the Creed  of Kinship.  <br />Now segue 1,000 years into the PAST (before the great  &quot;Drowning&quot;) into a world of cathode ray encephalographs, sine  wave frequency, and O.O.B.E.'s (out of body experiences).  Seems some  British scientists have made contact with Thomas of Norwitch, who is  floating in the Somersea (which used to be Somerset) thrown overboard and  left for dead because he's a kinsman. The scientist Carver finds himself in  Thomas' consciousness.  Carver wouldn't be detected at all if not for Jane,  the Kinfolk girl with e.s.p. powers who knows he is there and reaches back  1,000 years to contact the Bride of Time in his reality.<br />At first you  mightget the impression that this is sword and sorcery at worst or fantasy  at best until you get to the second book and you know it's true science  fiction.  I know of few writers who can pull this off - Ursula LeGuin comes  to mind.  This novel, because of the &quot;Church Militant&quot;, has been  compared to *A Canticle for Libowitz*, but for sheer lyricism and  philosophical depth, it reminds me most of *Engine Summer* by John Crowley.   Cowper made this into a trilogy - the kinship novels - all well worth  reading, but this first one, with its sense of wonder and delight, is, in  my opinion, his best.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-07-27

What we consider  &quot;givens&quot; today may appear puerile and outmoded in the scientific  thought of tomorrow.<br />Strickling charges that Darwinism, as originally  promulgated and currently perceived, is the Great Lie, &quot;...and it  engulfs us&quot; whereas Creationist interpretation is the &quot;Great  Mistake.&quot;  We would appear, therefore, to be between a rock and a hard  place because, as the author declares, &quot;...[I]t is dogma in both  religion and science that appears to be at the very heart of the ongoing  controversy surrounding our origins.&quot;<br />I hesitate to go too deeply  into Strickling's unique resolution of this dilemma.  It would be like  revealing who did it in a &quot;who done it&quot;, but the author begins  with the uniformitarianism vs. catastrophism controversy.  In our  present-day emerging scientific paradigm, uniformitarianism - the assertion  that nothing has happened in the earth's past that is not happening now, is  increasingly being beaten out by Catastrophism - the idea that in times  past the earth has suffered numerous disruptions from the nearby presence  of other planet-sized bodies.  &quot;Such disturbances,&quot; says  Strickling, &quot;would impact not only the earth itself, but all the  life-forms residing on it.  Evidence of these disturbances  abounds.&quot;<br />Strickling cites the work of Immanuel Velikovsky whose  research &quot;cuts across the fields of physics, astronomy, geology,  archeology, paleontology, history and mythology&quot; to assert that the  universe is electrical in nature and that &quot;the structure of the solar  system has changed in historical times.&quot;  Velikovsky made numerous  successful predictions (suchas the radio noise emanating from Jupiter) but  he was so thoroughly and unfairly maligned by the scientific establishment  that few of those predictions are remembered and credited to him.   (Einstein, who initially discountenanced his findings, changed his mind and  began a dialogue with Velikovsky just before his [Einstein's]  death.)<br />Strickling also cites the work of major Catastrophist authors  David Talbott and Dwardu Cardona to suggest that the planetary arrangement  the ancients saw was quite different from what we now see in the sky and  that creation myths described not creation, but the new order observed by  humans when the planetary arrangement changed.<br />Perhaps the author's most  tantalizing speculations are about the role of Extremely Low Frequency  electromagnetic fields (ELF's) in the ancient world and their importance in  such stories as the Tower of Babel (that the interruption of the  understanding of language may have been electromagnetic in nature), the Ark  of the Covenant (an electrical capacitor - all that copper, gold and  silver) halos (coronas - discharges resulting from the ionization of atoms  in an electric field) and other electrical phenomena that would have seemed  miraculous to ancient man.<br />In any case, as Dwardu Cardona has stated in  his Foreword to the first edition of this book, &quot;...the best weapon  against biblical fundamentalists is the Bible itself.  But by the same  token, science remains the best weapon against scientific  uniformitarians.&quot;<br />This is an exciting book in that the questions it  poses are as intriguing as its conclusions and for the sheer intellectual  delight in trying new ideas on for size.  I highly recommend  it.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-07-21

You just have to plow through the notes and appendix to find the author's sources - whether he has read Marija Gumbutas or Gerda  Lerner or Rene Eisler or Merle Stone.  And you can't look up words or place  names.  Much of the material in the notes could, I think, have been  incorporated into the text so that the reader doesn't have to keep flipping  back and forth from notes to text.  Also, the beginning chapter was verbose  and repetitive compared to what follows.  But all that aside, *Helen* is a  splendid and scholarly book worthy of being read and reread, mainly for its  psychological depth and sophisticated scholarship.  It's like champagne and  caviar.  Elegant.<br />Drawing on a vast and impressive classical base,  Meagher explores the question of Helen and by extension of Pandora,  Ariadne, Aphrodite, Eve and Mary - in other words - all the goddesses and  mortals who epitomize womankind.  They are woman's &quot;eikon&quot; or  &quot;eidos&quot;, not individuals.  Moreover, they are men's projection of  womankind, not the reality.<br />Meagher doesn't spend much time on  sociological answers to the problem of misogyny such as that males stamped  out the goddess religion so that they could take over the property owned by  females (as Merlin Stone has charged in *When God Was a Woman*) or that  virulent gender persecution was due to left-brain unbalance brought on by  literacy (as Leonard Shlain has suggested in *The Alphabet vs. the  Goddess*) or even that misogyny is a reflection of man's jealousy of  woman's procreative powers as numerous scholars have declared.  Instead, he  explores the deep psychological depths of man's hatred for woman through  the centuries and comes up with man's experience of powerlessness over his  desire.  Desire turns to hate and rage over that powerlessness until he  wants to control and punish the object of his desire.  That is why, in his  mind, the victim (woman) is always to blame.  &quot;Constitutionally out of  control, [man's] thirst for control is seemingly insatiable.&quot;  Love  and war are eternally linked.  &quot;Kredemna&quot; in Greek means both a  city's battlements and women's veils and eros has thanatos as an  overtone.<br />Meagher draws on history, literature, and archeology to make  his case that Helen and all her sisters throughout time have gotten a raw  deal.  Helen was just part of the process of simultaneously deifying and  demoninzing woman.  She was &quot;sundered, disempowered and  eroticized.&quot;<br />In his conclusion, Meagher says that &quot;...when  history is murdered and the past is forgotten, a great many things are  lost.  This volume has focused on two:  the humanity and the divinity of  woman.&quot;  I believe that anybody interested in the subject will want to  read this book.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-07-10
US	49869538	R33OSC4G5VHGJC	1881025063	404537898	Cancer Therapy: The Independent Consumer's Guide to Non-Toxic Treatment & Prevention	Books	5	62	64	N	N	Consider the Alternative	In his preface, Ralph Moss tells us that &quot;...the hub of the cancer establishment is a highly profitable drug development system, led by chemical, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.&quot;  I have seen  this claim corroborated by reputable medical people such as Dr. Samuel  Epstein in *The Politics of Cancer* and in Dr. John Robbins' *Reclaiming  Our Health.*<br />Moss points out that the major components of the cancer  establishment are the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the American Cancer  Society (ACS), grantees at major universities, the leading pharmaceutical  houses, and the FDA (Federal Drug Administration) &quot;...which regulates  the marketplace on behalf of the very industries it is supposed to  oversee.&quot;  Non-toxic cures, on the other hand, are called  &quot;questionable, unproven and unscientific&quot; (i.e. unprofitable to  the Cancer Industry).  Only orthodox cancer treatments - surgery, radiation  and chemotherapy -(cutting, burning and poisoning) are  &quot;scientific&quot; and presumably not to be questioned.  But there is  hope.  With the formation of the Office of Alernative Medicine (OAM) in  1992, there are now centers of alternative medicine at the medical schools  of Harvard, Stanford and Columbia, and a special center to study such  treatment has been established at the University of Texas.<br />As yet, I  don't have cancer myself, but I have watched beloved family members and  friends go brankrupt and die after undergoing these toxic treatments  without ever having had the knowledge to seek alternative cures.  That is  why this book, in my opinion, is such a valuable resource. Moss includes  information on cancer prevention as well as alternative treatments with  well-documented proof that they have worked for thousands of people all  over the world.  After each section, the author provides references and  resources.<br />Since cancer has increased to epidemic proportions in the  industrialized nations, I believe everyone would benefit from owning and  reading this book.<br />pamhan99@aol.com	2000-06-29
US	49869538	R24CYDIAEY0RTA	0870496948	211080554	The Hippies and American Values	Books	5	53	55	N	N	A Suprising Legacy	Although it has become fashionable to denigrate the whole hippie era as ineffective and counterproductive, Timothy Miller does much in this book to set the record straight about the considerable legacy of the Counter Culture -- for better or for worse.<br />From the ethics of sex, dope and rock  and roll, to the questioning of property rights and  greater latitude in  daily speech, from New Age spirituality to more ethical investments in the  market place - to the very food we eat - hippie culture has had a  tremendous and continuing impact on American society.<br />*The Hippies and  American Values*  appears to  pick up where Theodore Roszak's book, *The  Making of a Counter Culture* left off.  More than 20 years ago, Roszak  showed how an alienated generation undermined the foundations of the  prevailing technocracy.  Miller acknowledges this but goes on to point out  how the Counter Culture  gave free press and credence to right-brain values  that they saw as much neglected -- this before &quot;right-brain,  left-brain&quot; became buzz words.<br />&quot;Peace, love and flower power  are no longer standard argot,&quot; observes Miller, &quot;...Hip culture  has bloomed and died like a centuryplant...&quot;  But  the &quot;new  ethics&quot; of the hippies are here to stay nevertheless.  They are a  potpourri of traditional values, untried social experiments, and a few  truly original ideas for an American setting.  Hippies attacked new icons  such as technocracy while honoring agrarian values coupled with a new hip  Eco-consciousness.  The Counter Culture dropped out, disaffiliated from the  prevailing society and changed themselves in order to change the  world.<br />What I like most  about this book is that it is a resource.  It  belongs right up there on my bookshelf with Roszak's classic study and with  *Sleeping Where I Fall* by Peter Coyote, for starters.  It's no dry old  bone, however.  There are marvelous pictures of Be-Ins and Drop City, and  rock groupsand posters.  There is a bibliography of both well-known and  obscure underground newspapers (from which the author quotes extensively).   Where and when was the first Earth Day, the first Human Be-In, that  Death-of-Hip coffin?  They're all here.  And more.  Miller points us to  where and how the legacy continues even to this day.  If you never read  another book about hippies, read this one. pamhan99@aol.com	2000-04-25
US	49869538	R2EMQOM7P26EJP	081560601X	648743194	The 60s Communes: Hippies and Beyond (Syracuse Studies on Peace and Conflict Resolution)	Books	5	45	46	N	N	Arks to Lighthouses	If you've ever lived on a commune or if you're interested in studying intentional communities from roughly 1967 to 1975, this book is a page turner.<br />Having lived through the '60s era and having participated in the  communal scene, I often find myself irritated by inaccurate reporting by  authors who only seem interested in sensationalism (such as Robert  Houriet's *Getting Back Together*, 1971), but Timothy Miller does his  homework carefully, and I don't find such inaccuracies or biases in his  work.<br />*The 60s Communes:  Hippies and Beyond* is not a glib dismissal of  a blip on the screen of American community.  Miller makes it clear that  this is an ongoing phenomenon.  Many of these communities still exist (such  as The Farm in Tennessee) even though many have gone through  countless  evolutions and restructuring.<br />Miller compares land and food arrangements,  architecture, parenting, and social interaction of diverse communities  across this country along with their philosophies, ideologies and spiritual  perspectives.  He doesn't unrealistically romanticize and neither does he  condemn.  He just tells it like it is--and was.  And he bakes it into a  cake.<br />The book illustrates the profound effect that these communities  have had on our society.  It doesn't pretend to include in-depth personal  reminiscences or ideological transformations (such as those chronicled in  Peter Coyote's excellent *Sleeping Where I Fall*), but it brings all  elements together in an informative Big Picture of what was, what is, and  what may follow from this movement.  While the communes of the American  past were primarily arks, says Miller, those of the 60s were lighthouses.   I agree.  This is one good read.  I recommend it. pamhan99@aol.com	2000-04-18
