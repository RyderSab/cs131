Call me strangely incurious, but I never wondered about the life stories of the witches from the Land of Oz. After all, we generally think we know a lot about Dorothy and her gang, but I found that I didn't really know much at all until I read \\"Wicked.\\"    First, I found that appearances are deceiving. The \\"goodness\\" of a Witch may not be absolute or substantive. A Wicked Witch may be strangely soft hearted and altruistic. Thus, Maguire sets off to consider the conundrum of good and evil. All the while he entertains with a lively tale that reveals everything that you may have wanted to know, but didn't know who to ask, about Oz and all of its inhabitants.    Maguire's writing is delicious. Very simply, he uses big words and interesting sentences. The narrator is both an earnest reporter of Oz history and a clever satirist sharing an inside joke. Themes focus on the meanings of good, evil, family, religion, appearance, and substance. He explores the politics of power, civil rights, and repression. The characters and symbols are varied, unusual and complex. There is plenty to entertain the casual reader, and there is more than enough to occupy the mind of the most ambitious literary analyst.    My complaints are few. There are a couple of places that I think that Maguire REALLY stretches to make his plot fit back into the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" story in order to wrap things up (sort of) neatly. The conversation between the Wicked Witch of the West and the Wizard feels forced and less than true to the rest of the story. So, I give this book 4 stars for a bit of unevenness and a few rough spots in the plot.    I highly recommend this for readers who are interested in knowing more about what really happened in Oz and for readers who care about how well the story is told.	2005-09-26

Since I grew up in a house where the \\"Washington Post\\" was devoured daily, I was always aware of Katherine Graham.  I read this book shortly after she passed away, and I was knocked off my feet.      She was blessed by the accident of her birth into a family of extreme wealth and ultimate social position.  Her family's advantages - sadly compounded by her husband's untimely death - gave her inumerable opportunities.  At the same time, she was brilliant, capable, focused, and a gifted communicator. This combination of traits and circumstances allowed her to live a most enthralling, significant life.       Throughout, I marveled at her \\"realness.\\"  Her family had more money and servants and things than anyone I am ever likely to meet, but she describes her challenges, insecurities, and fears in a way that allow me to appreciate how she faced and succeeded in life.       This is a compelling read despite its length and detailed content.  It is well documented and beautifully written - without the aid of a ghostwriter.  It does not suffer from spurious melodrama, myopia, or vanity to which so many autobiographers fall victim.      I highly recommend both the form and substance of this book.	2005-09-16

The premise of this book is fascinating, and it gives the plot enough energy to keep you interested.     However:    1)  It is hard to write a novel with first person narration because the author often can't tell a compelling story while tied to that one, limited point of view. Fergus does not use this device to his advantage.  Additionally, I don't think that he gets inside the female mind.  Male thinking shows through too often.    2)  The historical setting is weak. Many of the events just don't ring true for the time. The women seem to have very modern expectations and sensibilities. Many events are thinly contrived to move the story.  Significant historical elements like slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction, the slaughter of Native Americans, repression of women, and poor treatment of the mentally ill, all receive shallow treatment.     3)  Furthermore, the characters are stereotypes including the scamming Irish immigrants, the fallen Southern Bell, the self-righteous Christian missionary, and the priest that molests little boys.  They  are not transformed by living their lives. The dialogue is uninspired, predictable, and trite.    The saving grace is, of course, the \\"interesting enough\\" plot.  I don't recommend this book, especially for readers who want to be challenged or inspired, because of its lack of dimensionality.  However, it may be fine for the beach.	2005-09-02
US	52102819	RIT2UV39FCLJX	0060800984	391561251	Maggie-Now	Books	3	8	9	N	Y	Interesting, but not her best novel.	\\"Maggie Now\\" has many of the very compelling aspects of Betty Smith's novels - all of which are worth reading.  Her sense of the time and the place makes me feel like I am there.  I always feel like I understand Brooklyn at the turn of the century while I am immersed in one of her stories.  She has a beautiful way with words that allows me to see things like she did as a young girl.  All in all, she is one of my favorite authors.    However, I got the feeling in this book that she must have written it a bit at a time.  It seemed like parts flowed, but there were also gaps in the stream of the prose.  There are a couple of places where I could imagine her returning to a manuscipt after not having written for awhile and having to get reacclimated to the plot and characters.      Furthermore, I found the characters to be uncharacteristically shallow and unappealing.  The \\"Claude\\" story line was weak and very unbelievable.  When he finally revealed the truth about his life, it was anti-climactic.  The ensuing resolution was trite.    So, if you are a Betty Smith fan, read this.  If you want to read her best - go for \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.\\" \\"Joy in the Morning\\" is almost a sequel to \\"A Tree,\\" and is probably the next best written.  \\"Tomorrow Will be Better\\" is also good reading.	2005-08-10

I am not a Mormon - probably because my paternal Grandfather \\"left the Saints\\" in 1936.  I am not a psychiatrist, but I have plenty of crazy relatives.  Based on this tangential life experience, I have come to see that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is based on fictional stories created by an opportunistic and randy Joseph Smith.  Furthermore, I think that Martha Beck is a superb writer, MAY be a survivor of abuse, and MAY have a psychiatric disorder.   <br /> <br />I needed to set the context for this review because so many reviewers seem to think that Martha is crazy OR the Mormon church is incredibly weird.  I, on the other hand, happen to believe that both things are true - which has a lot to do with my perception of Martha Beck's books.   <br /> <br />In \\"Expecting Adam\\" Beck's extreme emotions seemed odd and scary.   I kept thinking that if she was REALLY near death every other day of her pregnancy, wouldn't her husband, her doctor, a relative, somebody on the street, have tried to help?  While the story was admittedly gripping, I found it hard to accept that her life played out in the way she told it.  With \\"Leaving the Saints,\\" I found similar problems.    <br /> <br />If these books were written as fiction, I would give them stellar reviews.  Beck's writing is pleasing and quirky.  She weaves fascinating, emotionally gripping stories.   In a work of literary fiction, her histrionics would have been called hyperbole.  Her painful life situations would have been seen as symbolic of the universal \\"every woman\\"/\\"LDS incest survivor.\\"  The arc of the storyline would have been praised for the way that it built to a feverish peak and how the denoument was palpably appropriate and thought provoking. <br /> <br />So, my recommendation is that you read Beck's books for the sheer enjoyment of stories well told.  Pretend that she acknowledged that each of them is \\"based on a true story.\\"	2005-05-09

I say \\"her life\\" because we are getting slices of her life in each of her novels.  {\\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" and \\"Joy in the Morning\\" are the most directly autobiographical.} Even though her prose are direct and her stories are  deceptively simple, I cannot put her books down.  I am there with her characters, inside their lives as they are living them.      Like in \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" the Irish/American impoverished desperation and the raw immediacy of young life are stark and vivid in \\"Tomorrow will be Better.\\"  Parents who never had a chance to develop emotional and physical resources themselves, are brutal toward their children.    The children have not lost hope for a better life, but they see people who have given up all around them.  As a prejudiced on-looker, I am driven to hope that they get the opportunity to be loved and loving and rise above their parents' frightening existence.       This is just as riveting as the rest of her books.  I only wish that there were more!	2005-04-05

It is very striking to me that when I read each of these books, my mental images of the characters and settings were in black and white. Well, really, I saw it all play out in shades of gray. The people and places in this book are dark, often dirty, lowly, depressed, depressing and teetering on the verge of hopelessness. <br /> <br />The title aptly states the novel's theme; the overriding feeling of the book is stark loneliness. The characters cannot connect with one another - even when they are trying very hard to do so. They don't have authentic relationships even when they think that they have found a soul mate. Each of them wants to share his or her inner-most truths, and without exception they are impotent in their attempts. They each have things that they want to do, talents that they want to express. In each case, they can't or don't overcome their personal burdens to reach their goals or to achieve any sort of success. In the end, they are each alone with little hope for a more fullfilling life. <br /> <br />The book is very well written. Each chapter is written as a stream of consciousness of one of 4 main characters who each move the story forward a (very tiny) bit. This book is all about characters. It is definitely NOT about plot. McCullers remains stylistically consistent throughout, which seems to be quite an accomplishment in this very ambitious first novel. <br /> <br />For me, reading this book is a literary accomplishment. I can check off another classic from my list of books to read. However, it was not a book that I found enjoyable. I would suggest that ambitious readers should tackle it. Its style, mood and characters are very effectively created and sustained. On the other hand, if you prefer plot, uplifting or hopeful themes, happy endings or characters that grow or overcome their limitations, you may not want to spend your reading efforts on this book.	2005-03-18

I remember that I commented in class that the book was unbelievable because the main character seemed to meet lesbians every place that she went. Surely there weren't that many gay women in the world!  So, lesson one for me was that I had been living a (very) sheltered existence.  <br /> <br />The other lesson turned out to be that we all have our own \\"coming of age\\" story.  Almost no one gets to adulthood without bumps and bruises.  We are driven to explore who and why we are.  Our evolution is tumultuous and inexorable.  Growing up is filled with joy and pain despite orientation - or any of the other descriptive details of life.   Brown makes this point beautifully in this novel. <br /> <br />This novel is instructive and enthralling.  HIGHLY recommended!	2005-03-03

With that sallient point out of the way, I will say that I found this book to be enlightening and heartwarming but not riveting.  Luckily for me, the mystery is unraveled while allowing the characters to unfold.  So, I looked at this book as a character study, and found that the people in the book are very interesting and, on occasion, achieve \\"almost fascinating\\" status.      I believe that the main character's disability is accurately portrayed.  Because he is presented in such an intimate, first person way, I got a new, fresh, \\"in my face\\" perspective on what it must be like to live with autism.  I found it to be exhausting.  My analogy is that it felt like being required to count and examine and understand an endless supply of tooth picks without ever being able to realize that it doesn't matter if you have a hundred, a thousand or a million tooth picks.  You just have a lot of tooth picks.  Additionally, these tooth picks have rules and characteristics that must be examined in great detail within each new situation that arises. Most profoundly, this adherence to known \\"tooth pick logic\\" is as important to the boy as anything else - including his relationships with his parents.  The ability to use judgement to prioritize information in order to reduce the number of details that must be faced each day is absent.  The process is maddening.       The parents are also very interesting to me.  They obviously had made many adjustments because of their love for their son.  It was easy to see that marital problems could arise because of the stress that he brings into their lives.  The twist about the mother's \\"death\\" seemed too contrived, but I guess it was required to satisfy the mystery.        I liked the book because it gave me a new way to see autism.  I enjoyed seeing parents loving their disabled child even though he seemed to revel in his own \\"unlovableness.\\" Read this for the character development and for the opportunity to see into themind of a very bright autistic young man.  See how he learns to make his way in the world.	2005-02-28

I remember crying when I finished it because I wanted the story to go on and on.  I pushed and prodded my Mom to get the rest of the books.  As quickly as they appeared as birthday and Christmas presents, I devoured them.  Almost 35 years later, I can say that I have read almost every book that has been written by or about Laura.     Many other reviewers have pointed out the especially wonderful aspects of the books.  The narrator ages as Laura grows up.  (What a cool concept!)  The story of 4 year old Laura's Christmas in Wisconsin is as real and moving as the description of 18 year old Laura falling in love with Almanzo in Dakota Territory.  The images are always fresh, and the stories always epitomize wholesomeness.  There is a consistency all the way through \\"These Happy Golden Years\\" that shows that great care and skill were employed to make the series unwaveringly good.    The real life of Laura was strenuous and uncertain.  She was poor most of her young life.  She and Almanzo faced great loss and always worked very hard to run their farm.  The many moves made by the Ingalls and Wilder families were made to escape difficulties like failed crops or to improve bad situations like poor health.  According to available accounts, Laura did not stay in close contact with her family after she left Dakota.  Her relationship with Almanzo does not seem to have been remarkable, and her relationship with her only child, Rose, was strained.      However, all of these mundane details coalesced to create some of the best books ever written.  Many readers do not know that Rose was the impetus for the Little House phenomenon.  She became a writer first, and she saw how she could help her mother to take the story of her life and turn it into beautiful literature.  There is controversy about how much Rose helped.  Some say that she was a full fledged ghost writer.  In any case, it is safe to say that the Little House series was a mother/daughter collaborative effort.       A talented mother and daughter turned the memories of a difficult, pioneering life into books that I could not put down.  I read and re-read them until they became part of my life experience.  I know that I am one of many for whom the experience made me love reading more, made me wonder more about how other people in other times lived, made me see how good people lived in the world, and made me more alive in some way.  I cannot say enough good things about these books.        Every child should read them, and every adult should read them again!	2004-12-02

Buck novel, \\"Peony.\\"  I adored it!  So, when  saw that Oprah had chosen, \\"The Good Earth,\\" I was excited because so many people would be exposed to such wonderful literature with so much to teach Americans in the 21st Century.<br /><br />I have to guiltily admit that I was a bit disappointed by this book.  I know that I should have loved it best, but \\"Peony\\" is still so alive in my mind.  \\"Peony\\"'s characters, male and female as well as servant and master, make me feel their angst.  I feel the very deep and personal effects of cultural dissolution.  I can climb into the characters' skins and imagine how they were experiencing a life quite unlike mine.  I can feel how their time and space were lived diferently.  Their priorities and their sacred seem both unfamiliar and illuminating.  A life so strange to me - became part of my own experience as I read \\"Peony.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Good Earth\\", on the other hand, presents a more linear, cogent record of the life of Wang Lung's family. It has an inexorable, unavoidable cadence in its words and events.  In some way Buck forces the reader to observe from a distance.  We are not invited to partake of the characters' pain and joy in a personal way. I remained a spectator rather than a participant.<br /><br />Perhaps this shade of difference is important only to me.  In the end, I believe that \\"Peony\\" and \\"The Good Earth\\" are wonderful novels with much to teach with their unusual setting and point of view.  However, \\"Peony\\" will always be much more of an experiencial event than just a very good book.<br /><br />I recommend that you read both.  It is hard to pass up a book that led to a Nobel Prize in literature, but it would seem a great loss to miss the full experience that \\"Peony\\" provides.	2004-10-21

This is a science fiction love story in which the sci fi aspects are central to the plot and themes.  However, the science fiction is sublimely overshadowed by the wonderful development of the characters.<br /><br />Because we (ostensibly) live linearly, it is very hard to write about time travel and not introduce logistical issues that can't be handled cleanly.  This book seems to have carried it all off quite nicely.  I didn't notice any problems with consistancy, and, as a result, I was totally able to suspend disbelief.  Kudos for good time travel!!<br /><br />Furthermore, the characters and their relationships are deep, wide, convoluted, and enthralling.  Their angst was believable and familiar.  Because the characters were so vivid, this book turned out to be a tear jerker.  Which I mean in a good way.<br /><br />Most important are the ideas that this book explores about the nature of time.  The characters tell us that we exist continuously, perhaps infinitely, at all moments of our lives.  Time is really nothing.  We just \\"are\\" without regard to the calendar or the clock.  Very thought provoking stuff!<br /><br />This is a very good book, with excellent characterization and themes.  It is slow in the middle, but it kept my attention so that I was able to enjoy the emotional whirlwind ending.<br /><br />I recommend this for those who like to read about relationships with a little sci fi thrown in.  It probably will not appeal very strongly to the hard core sci fi crowd.	2004-08-28

I am very open to many forms of spirituality, spiritualism, and mysticism, and I thought that this book would at least give me food for thought about relationships in general and about the specific relationships in my life.         Unfortunately, I did not resonate with the descriptions in the book. I think the main reason is that the prognosis was almost always negative. I know that all relationships are a complex mixture of positive and difficult elements. However, most relationships are not mostly bad. Furthermore, I do not want to dwell, almost exclusively, on the reasons that relationships won't work. I would rather know about how to make them better.

The title, the topic and Buck's reputation helped me decide to read it.  I am so glad that I did.    Other reviewers have told of the understated, beautiful use of language.  They have spoken of the interesting juxtaposition of the Jewish and Chinese cultures, the gentleness of the story, and Buck's decision not to satisfy our need for a Hollywood ending.     All of these wonderful aspects allowed me to focus on other layers of the novel.  The fact that the Jewish community in Kaifeng eventually allowed themselves to forget their own culture was fascinating.  Their acceptance of and integration into the Chinese culture is portrayed as inexorable.  Most slipped away easily; others faced the loss with overwhelming grief.  Buck describes the Chinese characters in this book as being accepting of others while being a bit hedonistic themselves.  They choose to seek pleasure and temporal fullfillment while the Jews focus on the horror of oppression, complex ritual and the absolute truth of their history and destiny.  In other words, it seemed that the Jews were willing to give up their faith because it was difficult to maintain personally and for the community as a whole.      The final destruction of the core of the Jewish community is, ironically, a product of being a \\"chosen people.\\"  Kao Lien (a business associate of the Ezra family) tells David ben Ezra (Peony's young master) that the Jews, \\"were hated because they separated themselves from the rest of mankind.  They called themselves chosen of God.\\"  This is David's first inkling that the world has alternate views of the Jewish people. This is a pivotable moment in the novel.  This conversation gives David enough distance from his own culture to allow him to choose a Chinese wife and to move farther from the religion of his mother.  Because he chooses not to become a leader of the Jews in his city, the Temple andthe culture eventually fall into ruin.    More than most novels, this one is a rare combination of attributes.  It is entertaining, informative, thought provoking and good literature.  I will certainly read more of Buck's work and urge others to read this novel.	2004-07-13

However, this is a minor shift away from what I think is a gripping, unique, well thought out, well written tale.  It has fascinating characters that grow and develop while remaining consistent enough over the years covered by the plot. <br />The premise of a murder victim viewing her familiy, friends and murderer from &quot;her heaven&quot; works amazingly well for me.  This is a book about characters.  The people, their relationships, and their transformation over time is the focus throughout.  This is where Sebold's brilliance shines.  In this context, it could be O.K. that Susie inhabits Ruth's body for awhile.  Perhaps crossing over in both directions could happen.....  But, I think that it is cool to think that both girls/women need to experience the other side.<br />I would like to have known more about Sebold's vision of heaven and what happens to the souls who inhabit it.  What is the relationship between the two sides of existence?  There were hints, but I stayed curious - not in a thoroughly thought provoking way.   <br />The story is a bit gory in spots.  It also has some cleverly developed suspense.   I consider myself pretty sensitive to negativity in books, but I was more than O.K. with this one.<br />Highly recommended!	2004-07-07

She dribbles out details at a delightful pace.  Best of all, it is difficult to see through to the end of the story, and this story made me want to get there.   <br />Unfortunately, I can't read a novel without paying attention to the literary elements like imagery and character development.  While the book contains more good stuff than problematic stuff, it does have a few issues that frequently jarred me out of the story's flow.  Clearly, her intentions were good and right, and I usually thought that I knew where she wanted to go.  However, the words - and therefore her pictures - often missed the mark.<br />Additionally, there are multiple occasions where the characters do or say things that are out of line with what is developed earlier in the book.  The instances that I can recall, seem to happen at times where McFadden wants to move the plot more quickly or in a different direction and just doesn't take the time to do it more elegantly.  <br />Maybe the things that I see as negative are due to this being a first novel.  However, it seems to me that a good editor could have caught and helped to fix some of the difficult passages.  I also think that this book could have been longer which would have given her more room to make graceful transitions and more words to develop her characters.  <br />[McFadden is clearly very talented.  She actually made me think of a Steinbeck wanna-be.  She tries, in this book, to use words in a similar way, but just wasn't there yet.  I'll have to check out her later writing to see if she gets there.]	2004-04-11

The photos appear to be photo-copies of originals.  <br />One of the reasons that this book is significant is because of personal clues that it reveals.  For example, Annie had a ferocious temper - even with Helen.  She was a perfectionist who pushed Helen to do or try to do many very difficult things. She wanted Helen to speak like a hearing person and pushed her to practice extensively.  Helen tried, but because of her severe hearing loss, was never able to cultivate a voice that was as clear and \\"sweet\\" as Annie wanted it to be.  Annie also was determined that Helen should be the best at everything she attempted including the best scholar at Radcliffe College.  She forbade Helen to read books that were of questionable literary value.  Helen, however, did not seem to suffer from these pressures in a lasting way - maybe due to her naturally accepting and gentle nature.       <br />Another reason that this book is important is that it shows how and what Helen thought about her life and Annie.  Both Annie and Helen were very gifted in the use of language.  This shared modality fostered and colored their communications and their vision of life.  It became their means of earning a living in the forms of lectures and writing.  <br />Helen's writings about her \\"Teacher\\" show that she adored, respected, worried about and loved Annie.  She mourned the fact that Annie did not receive more of the credit for Helen's success.   This book makes clear, on the other hand, that the teacher had an extremely apt student.  It was a partnership between two women who loved one another, who were both very bright, who had very different temperments, and who became a family.<br />There are two other must reads for the Annie Sullivan/Helen Keller scholar.  Both have more and better photos of Helen and Annie.  One is \\"Anne Sullivan Macy\\" by Nella Braddy Henney.  Braddy was a contemporary and friend of Helen and Annie.  This book provides a very sympathetic version of their lives.  \\"Helen and Teacher\\" by Peter Lash is probably more objective.  It shows them in a somewhat less heroic way.  Together these two biographies provide a rather complete picture of Annie and Helen as they were.	2004-03-14

Miss Julia's character is wildly inconsistent throughout.  It seemed, for instance, that the author could not decide if Julia knew that her pastor was a creep or not.  On one page she knew that clearly, on the next she was starting over at the bottom of that learning curve.  The scene in which she is accused of being a nymphomaniac is unbelievable and just plain weird.<br />It seemed like a really bad \\"I Love Lucy\\" episode where people that you have seen to be smart and of good judgement did really odd, stupid things.  The resulting situations required more unwieldy events to get back to a reasonable, and predictable, ending.  <br />On the other hand, the overall plot provided enough interest to ensure that I finished the novel.  It is easy, mostly positive reading for times when you need pure, low stress escape.  I don't have much interest in the sequels, but I can concede that Miss Julia may have a place in the world of light reading.	2004-03-08
US	52102819	R1BD8RRR3VK6CH	0142004235	974134151	East of Eden, John Steinbeck Centennial Edition	Books	5	7	7	N	Y	Rich language, beautiful imagery and heavy symbolism	By the time Steinbeck wrote \\"East of Eden,\\" (EOE) he had already written several American classics including \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" and \\"Cannery Row\\" to mention only a few.  By then, he was a recognized master of the use of language.  He could and did create complex images that evoked a wide range of thoughts and emotions.  The first chapter of EOE  - where he describes the setting of the Salinas Valley - lets any doubter know that they are reading the product of a magnificent writer.<br />I have sampled a few scholarly reviews of EOE, and I was dumbfounded by the negative tone that critics have used in reference to this novel.  Their problem seems to be with the heavy-handed use of symbolism.  There are one-sided characters that can be nothing more or less than the idea that they are representing.  Cathy is probably the clearest example of this, evil and nothing but evil.  Steinbeck also portrays two sets of \\"Cain and Abel\\" brothers who act out variations of the themes of brotherly murder and being a \\"brother's keeper.\\"   So, this is an interesting and valid observation.  <br />However, the wonders of the book clearly overshadow all else.  In addition to the imagery, which is arguably unsurpassed in American writing, he has used the story of his mother's family, the Hamiltons of Salinas Valley, to serve as an historical backdrop for the story of the symbolically challenged Trasks.  He has painted a picture of his own beginnings with flair and insight while interweaving the morality tale that creates the tension and vehicle that moves the plot along.  This feat is handled seamlessly.  Each family is colorful and interesting.   Each individual is fully developed.  As a result, each page is anticipated and savored.  <br />In the end I would say that the \\"scholars\\" need to be careful.  Like all subjective evaluations, the judgement of the quality of John Steinbeck's work is relative.  Perhaps he did not surpass his greatest accomplishments with EOE.On the other hand, very few novelists have come close to the artistry that flows through this book from beginning to end.	2004-01-16

As other reviewers point out, this trilogy is exceedingly readable.  In my opinion, Gulland deserves more than the usual accolades for this accomplishment.  The style in which she writes is very difficult to use successfully.  Because the entire text is in the format of Rose/Josephine's journal entries, Gulland limits the tools that she can use to tell the story of her heroine.  First, everything is necessarily written in first person.  The only time the reader gets a glimpse of the points of view of other characters is through the conversations that Josephine reports.   Additionally, everything is strictly in time order - no flash back or foreshadowing.  Finally, Gulland does not permit herself to use omniscience in the form of a character or narrator.  We must be fully satisfied by hearing about Josephine's life in Josephine's words.  What a feat!<br />Within the confines set for herself, Gulland creates a wonderful work of fiction and of history.  The characters are big and real and riveting.  The pain felt today and the tension felt about the future are palpable.  The many facets of each individual are described in glorious detail.  The story line is terrifying because it is one woman's harrowing life, and it is one nation's journey through unspeakable trial.  I was left wondering if Josephine had been in another time, in safer environs, would her beauty have shown so brightly?  She is clearly a pearl before and amongst the swine of her era and situation.  I definitely want to read more about her!   <br />Other nice touches provided by Gulland include family trees for Rose/Josephine and Napoleone's families, a glossary of characters and a historical time line of events.    These details help the reader to stay grounded in the reality of history.  My only, very small, criticism is that the language and context seem very modern.  Perhaps there are striking similarities between now and then, but it seemed a bit jarring when I began reading the first novel.  <br />Ihighly recommend these books to anyone who is interested in the lives of women whether or not you are a true history buff.  They also provide a great primer of the French Revolution.	2003-08-31

When the people of this town are threatened by disease, death and isolation, their actions in the throes of terror is enthralling.<br />Some become selfless.  Some go crazy.  Most re-interpret their religion.  Some become mean, spiteful, violent.  Many look for a scapegoat.  A very few keep their heads, and just try to do the right thing.<br />I will say that the ending seems to go beyond the reasonable story that leads up to it.  However, this book is well worth the emotional angst and the eventual skepticism that it evokes.	2003-07-21

It is amazing what a violent reaction some readers have had.  I am not sure why these \\"negative reviewers\\" are afraid to  consider different ways of thinking and experiencing life.<br /><br />For me, this book expresses profound ideas about the nature of life.  Basically, it shows that we can choose to experience events and people in a loving, positive way or in a fearful, negative way.  Therefore, we can shift our point of view to see the love that is there in any situation.  This is the miracle.<br /><br />Since I have been filled with anxiety most of my life, this approach to life has been freeing and calming.  You REALLY do not need to feel afraid.  You can choose to see life, people, and situations in a positive, uplifting way.  It REALLY is about perception.  The choice to move toward peace by seeing the love in my life is worth at least 5 stars!<br /><br />The \\"Course\\" does not claim to be all things to all people.  It clearly states that it is not necessary for anyone to read it in order to be \\"saved\\" or enlightened or good or right.  It simply presents, in a rather unique style, a way to think about the nature of life and spirituality.  The writing style is bulky, because it presents each point using several different literary styles - didactic, metaphorical, allegorical - so that whatever your learning style, you will be able to ingest the ideas.<br /><br />If you are firmly anchored in one religion or are a fundamentalist of any kind, you probably will not see value in this book.  However, as a young adult, traditional Christianity disenchanted me.  Even as I am moving into middle age, it still seem limiting.  I cannot accept that there is only one \\"right\\" life path - or that you must believe any particular theology.  God must be more encompassing and more loving than that.<br /><br />The \\"Course\\" has given me a sense of peace about our reason for being.  For me, it has never been about making sure everyone \\"gets religion.\\"  I believe that it is all about love and peace, and the \\"Course\\" helped me to give form to my beliefs.<br /><br />I am not a dramatic person by any means.  However, I will tell anyone that \\"A Course In Miracles\\" has been life altering.  It has helped me to focus on the love in my life and in the world.  And there can't be anything wrong with that!<br /><br />I highly recommend that if you consider yourself a spiritual seeker, that you give the \\"Course\\" a try.s religion.\\"  I believe that it is all about love and peace, and the \\"Course\\" helped me to give form to my beliefs.

This book covers a niche of personality type - types at work - almost perfectly.  It provides just the right amount and type of information to help anyone use Myers Briggs (MB) theory effectively in the work place.  While it has a brief discussion about personality type theory in general and self assessment, there are many books that cover that in more depth, detail and with greater clarity.  This book is probably best suited to those who are already somewhat familiar with the MB 16 types.  For detailed background, see my favorite: Keirsey's &quot;Please Understand Me II.&quot;  <br />Where &quot;Working Together&quot; really rises above the rest is in the focused way that it addresses types at work.  It provides a detailed description about how each type functions in both leadership and worker roles with the goal of maximizing performance through understanding varying traits, values and motivations that are present in each type.  It even has thumb tabs to help you go right to the information that you want.  It is a self proclaimed reference book that hits the mark.  The format is superb.  The content is exceptional.     <br />This is a must have for the personality type obsessed and those who want to understand how and why people perform and interact the way that they do at work.	2003-06-18

Since I was a child I have been fascinated by them and have read everything that I could get my hands on. Lash goes beyond their heroism and describes Annie and Helen as real people with \\"feet of clay.\\"<br /><br />He relies heavily on voluminous correspondence to show the many facets of Helen and those in her life. Many of these details are not explained in other biographies.  For example, Helen's father tried to shore up his finances with loans (often defaulted) from Helen's patrons.  The \\"Frost King\\" incident caused many people to doubt Annie's veracity and credibility as a teacher for the rest of her life.  Mr.Sandborn and Mr. Anagnos used the controversy to divert attention from Annie's role as Teacher to Helen and to re-focus attention on the role that the Perkins Institute played in her education.  Lash also shows that John Macy had a complex relationship (for the good and the bad) with both Annie and with Helen.  Helen was a radical Socialist and often risked her popularity and, therefore, their income by speaking out in support of Socialist leaders and causes. In the end the reader sees that Helen and many of those around her did great things, but they were not perfect. Insecurity, jealousy, money and a desire for love and fame caused all of them to act ugly sometimes.<br /><br />The other point that was never clear to me before, is that Helen and Annie spent their lives marketing themselves in order to generate an income. Helen's father faced a serious financial downturn that prevented him from supporting them from Helen's young womanhood on. Therefore, to continue Helen's formal education and to maintain a home away from Alabama, they had to cultivate sponsors, write publishable material, and earn money speaking at a myriad of functions. In many ways, this was an uncertain life that dictated that they remain in good standing with public opinion at all times.<br /><br />The other connection that Lash made for me concerns the complexity, the depth and the breadth of Annie and Helen's relationship. Because Annie suffered through a harrowing childhood, she desperately needed to create a loving family. Helen presented the perfect opportunity for Annie to be needed and to love and be loved unconditionally. While some people construed their relationship to be unhealthy or manipulative, it seems that it was a natural outgrowth of their particular situation. Once again, it was not perfect, but it served a huge need for them both.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to see a more realistic view of the lives of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan.	2003-06-07

First, in some sections it is clear that Miller does not have enough documented sources of information.  In these chapters, his writing jumps around, back and forth in time, and is very repetitive within and among paragraphs. Secondly, he provides almost no information that I have not seen before. Despite these complaints, this book seems to be very well researched and is readable throughout.<br />The focus on the \\"Rose Story,\\" that many other reviewers complain about, is actually the most cleanly written part of the book. No doubt, this can be attributed to the fact that there are MANY extant primary sources that depict the relationship between Laura and her daughter.  They apparently wrote to each other constantly.  Therefore, Miller does not need to stretch his material regarding this part of Laura's life.<br />On the other hand, readers who love Laura and her stories want to know more about the family and other people described in the novels. We want to know about Laura's relationships with her parents and adult sisters and with the Wilder in-laws. We want to know what happened to Mary, Carrie and Grace after \\"These Happy Golden Years.\\" We want to know what Almanzo was really like. These topics are not explored in depth. <br />In the end, my disappointment is not in Miller and his writing. It is rooted in two inescapable facts. First, most of Laura's adult life was quite ordinary. She and Almanzo, like the Ingalls family before them, were poor most of the time.  The magical Laura and \\"Manly\\" of \\"Little House\\" fame did not heroically rise above circumstances and make a great success of farming.  Their married relationship does not appear to have been remarkable.  Their relationship with Rose seems to have been tense due to the usual  generational differences.  My second and most depressing disappointment is that there are no sources that have preserved the more personal aspects of the Ingalls and Wilder legacy. So, while I would like to know more of the family details, no one knows for sure what they are. <br />All in all, if you are a real Laura fan, you will want to read this book.  However, do not expect much excitement or new information.	2003-03-31

The story and characters remain recognizable nonetheless. <br />So, if you have read \\"A Tree..\\" this is a satisfying novel because you feel like you have read about the next chapter in the lives of familiar people. The best part of this book is something that it has in common with \\"A Tree..\\" They are both heavily autobiographical; therefore, they really give you the flavor of Betty Smith's life in the U.S. around the turn of the century. In the end, however, this book is much less interesting than its antecedant.	2003-03-29

Both books are beautifully and imaginatively illustrated by Lynn Munsinger in their 1995 & 1996 publications.  As with other works by Nash, the verse and illustrations vie for significance and importance.  His couplets are cute with his tongue in cheek.  The words and images carry a slightly archaic, old fashioned overtone that is pleasing.    <br />This is not the greatest children's book ever published.  However, the nuanced language is intriguing.  It has a meaningful moral - that true bravery is not always recognized or rewarded but is a wonderful thing nonetheless.  As a result, the \\"Custard\\" books have a rather timeless appeal.	2003-02-17

My purchases included work by Dr. Spock, Dr. Sears, Penelope Leach, and Dr. Brazelton. \\"Your Child's Health\\" is the only one that I still have. <br />First, this book is organized in a VERY useful way. For each type of issue/illness, there is a quick summary that leads you quickly to an understanding of what you probably should do for your child right now, tomorrow or at your next doctor's appointment. <br />This book also helps to calm nervous parents. The section about fevers is a great example of this. Barton acknowledges that fevers are scary for parents. He then provides calming words, clear facts and direction about when you really need to worry.<br />This book does break down when it comes to issues that I consider cultural or social in nature. I do not think that this author is an expert about family beds, breast feeding or feeding schedules. I think that he is simply expressing views that were in vogue when he was in med school. I would strongly reccomend Dr. Sears or the La Leche League for more thorough and thoughtful information on these subjects. <br />Despite this small weakness, I think that this is a book that every family with babies and small children MUST have.	2003-01-05

Thompson delves into how Myers-Briggs (MB) typology dove-tails with Jungian theory from the top down.  She begins in familiar territory with a high level overview of the 4 MB parameters and a test.  She then quickly moves into a very detailed discussion of each type's dominant, secondary, tertiary and inferior functions.  Further explanation is dedicated to functions that are ruled by the right or left brain. <br />This is a thorough treatment of the topic.  However, this is not  a very helpful or intuitive explanation of personality type.  The root of my disatisfaction is as follows.  Keirsey, in &quot;Please Understand Me II&quot; groups the 16 MB types into 4 sub-groups:  NF, NT, SP &amp; SJ.  These sub-groups are clearly mutually exclusive.  Thompson (Jung) divides the 16 MB types into 8 sub-groups:  ES, IS, EN, IN, ET, IT, EF, &amp; IF.    These groupings become mutually exclusive only when you understand and accept that every MB type has a prescribed dominant, secondary, tertiary and inferior function.  I don't accept this caviat.  <br />In my experience the Keirsey groupings hold up in practice.  They are easily understood, and most people clearly fit into one of the four classes.  Thompson's 8 groupings are complex, and there is no intuitively obvious way to categorize people into the the 8 classes - without giving everyone the test. <br />Despite my crititicism, I should point out that Myers and Briggs themselves use Jung's 8 categories in &quot;Gifts Differing.&quot;  They do not dwell on it or provide lengthy explanations, but it clearly is how they approach the task of typing.     <br />To summarize:  This is a wonderful explanation of Jung's personality theory explained through a MB lens.   However, it does not provide the most effective tools for applying MB theory in practice.	2002-12-31

I think that my children would love him now as much as I did in the '60s!	2002-12-23

Unlike many historical volumes, the information is accessible to the more casual reader.  <br />Perhaps the best part of this book is that the historical figures are shown to be real people.  The effects of personality, personal values and relationships are made evident.  Because of Ellis' chosen point of view, a fuller view of the events and people of that era  is presented.     Highly recommended.  A fast read.	2002-11-29

First, readers can see that the theory has very practical origins. It was born out of observing personalities of MANY people. It was meant to be used in a very hands-on way. It was not designed to be a tool for psychologists only.  It was meant to be used by anyone who wants to understand self and others.    Another key point that emerges from this book is that differences are good. The theory does not treat personality traits as pathological, needing repair. On the contrary, the authors recognize that the varied types of personalities add unique, valuable qualities to the world.     There are other sources that explore this topic in a more detailed, scholarly way. However, this book sets the context for the origin and the intended use of the theory. Therefore, it is a must read for any student of personality.	2002-11-29

Keirsey ties personality theories of the past to current thinking and theory.<br />Second, he focuses the reader on the four temperments - NF, NT, SJ & SP. This \\"short cut\\" allows people to easily see the major groupings of temperment, values and style. It also helps to determine an individual's type quickly without understanding all the details of all 16 types.<br />Some people don't like categorizing people at all. This book does a good job of explaining that the types are just tools to use in a quest for understanding. Well-rounded people will be able to use the strengths of all of the types. There is nothing restrictive about the theory.<br />I highly recommend this book for students of personality theory.	2002-11-28

While many people don't agree with all of the tenets of LLL, EVERY new mom will benefit from reading this book. It lets readers know that with very few exceptions, every woman can successfully breastfeed her baby. The bias is, of course, that every mom should breastfeed. After reading this book, it is hard to argue with this premise. <br />The book provides information on the technical aspects of nursing as well as the physical, medical and emotional benefits. They provide details that show that no formula can even come close to copying the contents of breast milk. <br />The authors make it clear that they believe that breastfeeding is THE best thing that moms can do for their babies. No matter how the reader feels about LLL, parents can benefit from their message. They want moms to relax and know that they CAN breastfeed while giving their children a wonderful gift.	2000-02-25
