You'll need some reading stamina, because it's long and parts of it are uninteresting.  Hall's facts are wrong in a couple of places (just a few examples: his chapter on Islam is pretty much worthless, and since when was Thor's hammer made of ram's horns?) and he seems to have an axe to grind, in terms of linking Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism to Pythagoreanism, Alchemy, etc etc to the shadowy Illuminati pulling the strings behind the formation of the United States and its model of government.  America supposedly has some sort of Mystical Destiny that was predetermined by a group of Immortal Magi, the true initiates of the Elysian and Hermetic mysteries, and so on.  Please .. tone down the crazy just a bit, Mr. Hall! <br />You'll have to read with a slightly critical eye to pick out which parts of this book are useful to you and which parts are not, but overall it is definitely worth the effort.  I was introduced to a lot of new ideas.  One of the benefits of mysticism is the new perspective it can give you, a new way of perceiving the same old things you've been looking at all your life.  There are profound secrets everywhere which will reveal themselves to the one who makes the EFFORT to discover them. <br />As far as this book being \\"evil,\\" it just plain isn't.  It may pose a challenge to the dogmatic status-quo of the current dominant religion (which incidentally, is failing to meet the needs of modern civilization) ... but that religion itself was regarded as a threatening evil 2000 years ago when it encroached on the very Mysteries which Hall elucidates in this book.  The only \\"evil\\" being perpetrated is by those who would - for their own selfish reasons - keep humanity in spiritual darkness.  So there.	2005-10-14
US	30163399	RUD02C5XD0UT9	1582344167	481973042	Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell	Books	3	41	51	N	N	Enjoyed it, but...	At 782 pages, there's a definite level of commitment here.  Once you start a book this size, you should understand that you'll be reading it for a WHILE.  Nobody should expect this will be a \\"quick read.\\"  The chapters average about 12 pages each, which is a nice bite-size chunk; handy for reading in stages.  I finished it in 10 days, one of which was my day off from work so I spent the entire afternoon devouring the last 200 pages in one long rush.  Yeah, the action picks up around page 500 or so, and suddenly this lazy, plodding brick of a book you've been strolling through, admiring the sites and stopping occasionally for lunch, becomes an intense page-turner which absolutley DEMANDS that you find out what happens next.  The action escalates to a crazy, hectic climax.  But it takes a really long time to do so. <br />Other reviewers have lamented how boring this book is, and yes, I'll have to admit there's not a lot going on in the first 1 or 2 HUNDRED pages.  Ms Clarke takes her time establishing setting and characters.  I was prepared for this.  I have been reading the dullest nonfiction for the past 2 months, so it was a treat for me to read something that has characters and a plot.  This story COULD have been told in 400 pages, but the author has stretched it out with her languid, meandering storytelling style.  If you're not patient - if you're addicted to adrenaline and demand constant action, stay away from this book; go watch TV instead.  I don't understand why these people bought an 800 page book in the first place...  Expecting to be captivated in the first 10 pages?  Come on. <br />Anyway, Ms Clarke's narrative style could best be described as \\"whimsical.\\"  It borders on \\"cutesy\\" at times, and occasionally I felt like I was reading a children's book.  At one point early on, the narrative voice breaks character and addresses the reader directly, stepping out of the story and referring to itself as \\"I.\\"  This is all the more disconcerting because it onlyhappens once - which makes it seem like a mistake.  But the whimsy gradually melts away, and by page 400 the narrator has become invisible.  You've forgotten that she is there and you're just following the story.  It looks like Ms Clarke may have written this book in chronological order, so the first chapters, where the writing is weakest, are the first ones she wrote, and as the novel progresses she actually becomes a better writer (as I understand it, this book was more than 10 years in the making.) She is in much fuller posession of her powers by the time she reaches the end.  It's just that the reader has to slog along with her while she learns to master her craft. <br />The archaic spelling of some words seemed unnecessarily cute.  (\\"Scissars\\" and \\"chuze\\" spring to mind.  There were others.)  These words annoyed me every time I saw one.   <br />So much time has been taken developing the characters that you begin to feel that you know them.  You will identify with them.  (I realize, somewhat shamefully, that I am more like Norrell than Strange.)  By the end, you will care a great deal what happens to them.  But unfortunately the end, the _very end_ of the book, was a disappointing fizzle.  It was sappy.  The final impression I was left with upon closing the book was not a good one.  Probably could've done without the last chapter; the story was already over by then anyway. <br />Everybody has mentioned the footnotes scattered throughout the story.  They were quaint, usually funny, entertaining, and utterly pointless.  I liked them, but they weren't necessary and they made the book longer. <br />So, to sum up:  you need to have some reading stamina to get you through the first half because the story doesn't get really interesting (by Hollywood standards) til then.  The story itself feels like it should be only about half the size of the book, which tells me there was a lot of fat in it, bulking it up to 800-page proportions (but fat makes things taste good, right?)  Though I was entertained and occasionally amazed by this novel, I still can't say that it was GREAT.  3 stars.  Recommended if you have a lot of time to kill.	2005-08-26

Imagine the most boring person in the world telling you about this \\"erotic\\" dream he had.  As soon as he starts, you realize that to this guy \\"erotic\\" means \\"sensual\\" and he has a Medeival dread of his own sexuality.  He spends hours meticulously describing every pebble, every stone, every crack in the architecture, every flower in the gardens, every thread of the costumes worn by the armies of lovely (but \\"virginal\\") nymphs he encounters along the way. <br />Out of the 466 pages of the hardcover 2nd edition, there is action on approximately 75 of them.  The rest is lengthy and uninteresting description of the marvels Poliphilo sees in his dream.  Everything is described in superlative terms, and the figure is repeated so often you can almost sing along with Poliphilo:  \\"X such that was never seen/made/matched by Y.\\"  Where X is the thing described and Y is an obscure allusion to classical mythology or European lore of a person or place famous for its association with X or items like it.  The classical allusions are so frequent and so obscure, the reader will need a guidebook probably twice as thick as the Hypnerotomachia itself in order to understand them all. <br />People prate of the beauty of this book, but ...  I won't deny that the book itself, as a physical object, is quite beautiful, and the illustrations are interesting (however the women who are described in the text as \\"beautiful\\" are drawn sort of doughy with double chins and chubby baby-fat limbs.)  But the average modern reader will not be able to slog through what must have been considered in the Renaissance to be an enchanting pageant of loveliness.  The ceaseless barrage of adjectives and the narrator's simpering reluctance to ever take any sort of action will frustrate most members of a 21st-century audience. <br />This book is not without its merits, which are the reason I awarded it two stars.  The first 150 pages are quite delightful, because things are actually happening in the story, the experience is still new, and the interminable tedium of the next 300 pages has not yet beaten the reader's brain into a catatonic state.  The sumptuous banquet at the court of Queen Eleuterylida is a memorable highlight.  There's an interesting scene right in the middle of the book, in which Poliphilo explores a ruined cemetery and reads epitaphs of unfortunate wights who died of love.  Numerous descriptions of pagan rituals are interesting, if not accurate.  The book is completely saturated with Greco-Roman paganism, which was a fad at the time it was written. <br />The act of reading the Hypnerotomachia can be rewarding in spite of, or perhaps because of its tedium.  I forged onward with the grim determination that I would finish this book, no matter what ... my eyes rolled in my head as I fought off sleep, hypnotic streams of uninteresting adjectives reducing my awareness to a dreamlike state.  I would read pages and afterwards have no memory whatsoever of what they had contained.  Strange ideas and mental pictures emerged which seemed to come, not from the book, but from somewhere behind it.  I found myself titllated by vivid erotic fantasies which seemed totally unrelated to what I was reading.  Was this some sort of magic, intentionally worked by the author of the Hypnerotomachia, or was it my subconscious mind desperately trying to entertain itself in the face of such monumental dullness? <br />I recommend this book for anyone interested in a non-chemical psychedelic experience.  But try to find it at the library, don't spend your hard-earned money.	2005-06-22

It is set in an \\"Egyptian\\" square-serif font that almost looks like it was typed on a typewriter.  The cover seems to be the same as the new edition:  a rough-looking woodcut of the black hen with some eggs, a gleaming sun with rays that fill the sky and \\"LA POULE NOIRE\\" written inside it. <br />I'm very skeptical of this as a serious magickal resource.  The text is in the form of a narrative, supposedly written by a French officer in Napoleon's army (though he never mentions Napoleon by name) during the Egyptian expedition.  While surveying the Pyramids, his unit is attacked by Bedouins and all are killed except him.  He is badly wounded, almost dead, when he is rescued by a little old man who comes out of a secret door on the side of the pyramid.  Our hero convalesces in the old man's sumptuous pyramid apartment.  The old fellow adopts him as his son and teaches him the secrets of ancient magic from documents rescued from \\"the burning of Ptolemy's library.\\" <br />This story is fun to read and it was probably an influence for HP Lovecraft.  The magical amulets, rings, and words of power all have the air of being completely made up by a clever and inventive writer. <br />Despite what the back-cover copy says, complete instructions for the manufacture of the Black Pullet, the wondrous gold-finding bird, are NOT included.  Certain aspects of the bird's training are mentioned but not discussed.  I would certainly not trust these instructions well enough to ever try them myself.	2005-06-22

Undeservedly Obscure	Written by a Jesuit priest and teacher of moral theology in Rinteln, Germany, the year 1631.  Witch trials had reached almost epidemic proportions; madness and burnings were going on everywhere.  Friedrich Spee dared to speak out against the injustice he had personally witnessed as a confessor ministering to accused witches in prison.  He used the ruse of having the publisher take his manuscript and publish it \\"without the author's knowledge\\" to get it past the review of his superiors in the Jesuit order.  A second edition was published the following year by a printer thought by historians to be fictitious.  It was met with disapproval by the authorities and was recommended to be put on the Papal list of banned books, but it never was.  All of this is from the translator's informative introduction. <br />The book itself is a monument of rational thought in a world seemingly gone mad.  It is addressed to \\"the princes of Germany\\" though Spee pessimistically states that he doubts those who should read it, ever will.  His plea for justice, mercy, and basic human rights is nothing short of brilliant and has much to offer to us today.  Many of the principles and ideals which are the Constitutional foundation of the American judicial system are expressed here.  Hellyer's English translation sparkles, bringing Spee's relentless logic, passion, and occasional biting sarcasm into an immensely readable form for modern audiences. <br />Spee makes no attempt to refute the existence of witchcraft.  He admits that it is a horrible crime which should be punished severely.  However, he must bring to the princes' attention that trials are being conducted in such a way that innocent people are being burned.  \\"Out of fifty\\" he says, \\"I doubt that five, or even TWO are guilty.\\"  Point by point, question by question, he demolishes every argument used to justify the arbitrary and brutal practices of judges and Inquisitors.  He demonstrates clearly from a Biblical standpoint, from the authority of learned doctors of theology and law, and from the perspective of natural law and simple common sense, that trials conducted in this manner CANNOT continue, since putting innocents to death is a great sin and places the princes themselves in moral danger. <br />I can't adequately express how enjoyable, uplifting, and inspiring this book is.  Definitely a must-have for anybody interested in history, witchcraft / witch trials, law, religion, and human rights.	2005-06-01
US	30163399	R2DMQNH4G5GFXN	0801492890	96031313	Witchcraft in the Middle Ages	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Interesting but Dry	It's a historical overview on the evolution of witchcraft through the middle ages, from the perspective of a historian who doesn't seem to believe in magic, yet nevertheless admits there was _something_ going on.  The style is dry and academic, with lots of big words from sociological and psychological jargon.  At times it reads like a doctorial thesis. <br />The first two chapters are a sort of preperatory overview of the subject, with brief mentions of the ancient middle-Eastern and Egyptian origins of magic and the belief in good-vs-evil Dualism.  The next 7 chapters present a chronological evolution of witchcraft and how it was perceived (and dealt with) by the Church and secular authorities.  The time span is from 300 to 1480 a.d. meaning this book stops short just before the classic \\"witch craze\\" of the Renaissance began.  The final chapter is a summation of the significance of witchcraft in medeival thought. <br />Keeping in mind that the only records regarding witchcraft were written by it opponents, Russell carefully presents the information and offers a fairly objective assessment of it.  His overall thesis is that witchcraft was largely an invention of the Church, and that from ancient pagan roots, withcraft evolved alongside heresy.  He clearly demonstrates that the crime of witchcraft was regarded as distinct from simple heresy, and also distinct from sorcery and natural magic or herbalism.  He has pinpointed almost the exact moment when the notion of the \\"Devil's pact\\" was introduced.  He presents information about a number of medeival heresies, and shows how ideas crossed over into witchcraft - and even how some heresies later began to be prosecuted AS witchcraft.  He argues strongly against Margaret Murray's \\"witch cult\\" theory, suggesting instead that the apparent consistency of witch practices across Europe may be attributable to the consistency of Inquisitors' questioning.  (Again keep in mind _who_ was writing the records.  No sources of information from the witches themselves are known to exist.)  It was interesting to see that the early Church was quite skeptical about witchcraft, and had even declared it was wrong to believe that witches flew around at night and so forth.  That attitude was to change... <br />This book takes you up to a point just before the insanity and slaughter of the 14th and 15th centuries, and leaves you with a good background to continue research into the subject.	2005-06-01
US	30163399	R3Q5BXNBU2YYOF	0460876163	488597298	Edda (Everyman's Library)	Books	2	81	115	N	Y	Boring	I wanted to like this book.  I love Sagas of Icelanders.  I was ecstatic over the Poetic Edda.  Snorri's \\"Prose Edda\\" was frequently mentioned in my other reading, and I decided I would have to check it out.  What a disappointment. <br />I must clarify that by saying that the Prose Edda is an EXTREMELY important book of immense value to students of Medeival literature (specifically Scandinavian / Norse / Icelandic.)  It is the single most complete record of  Norse mythology which we have today, and along with the Poetic Edda, constitutes practically the sole source of material for all books which re-tell the mythological stories.  But the Edda is, unfortunately, a book to be read only for the value of the information it contains; not for entertainment.  All of the interesting material in the Edda is re-told (in much more readable ways) elsewhere.  Snorri himself, in the course of this book, re-tells \\"Voluspa\\" (from the Poetic Edda) and gives a brief synopsis of the Volsunga Saga. <br />Edda was written as a handbook for poets and scholars, to aid in understanding ancient Scandinavian poetry, which was thick with mythological allusions. Edda also provides guidelines for composing new poems using traditional forms.  It was written two or three centuries into the Christian era of northern Europe, when old pagan lore was already nearly forgotten.  Snorri's book kept his ancestor's cultural heritage from disappearing completely.  He treats the old myths very kindly, but is careful to throw in the obligatory Christian warnings about \\"false religion.\\"  According to \\"Gylfaginning,\\" (the first and most interesting part of the Edda) the Norse gods - the Aesir - were originally a tribe of people who migrated to the North from Turkey.  They were veterans of the Trojan War (!) so cultured and technologically advanced that they were regarded as gods by the ignorant folk in the lands they conquered and settled.  According to Snorri, most of the mythological stories are analogous to episodes from the Iliad. <br />The second section of the Edda is called \\"Skaldskaparmal\\" and it is very tedious.  It consists of a mythological discussion between Aegir (the sea god) and Bragi (the god of poetry) in which Bragi explains various kinds of kennings.  A kenning is a poetic figure of speech in which a person or object is referred to by describing it in terms of another person or object.  Then that secondary person or object can be referred to by yet another substitute, down to 4 or 5 levels of circumlocution, all of which has to be figured out by the listener to determine exactly what the poet is talking about.  Kennings are like riddles, allegories, metaphors, and allusions rolled all into one.  A fairly detailed myhtological background is required to make sense of them - thus, the reason for the Edda.  A few stories are told which explain some kennings, but gradually Snorri loses track of the \\"conversation\\" that initially provided structure for this section, and the reader gets mired amidst interminable lists of poetic synonyms for swords, ships, gold, and so on.  Quotes from old poems illustrate the use of many of the kennings. <br />The translator - for reasons which are certainly valid - opted to render all of the verse as prose, preserving its literal meaning [with allegorical meanings choppily inserted in square brackets,] but utterly detroying its power as POETRY. <br />The final section is called \\"Hattatal\\" and it consists of a few verse quotations and three original poems composed by Snorri himself in a different style for each verse, with sections of prose in between stanzas to explain the technical details (rhyme, meter, alliteration, etc) of each style.  There's a total of 102 verses in the Hattatal, and the poetry here is actually somewhat interesting; more so, at least, than the nuts-and-bolts discussion of the fine points of skaldic composition.  In this section, each verse is presented in the original Old Icelandic (with modernized spelling) with English translation underneath. <br />At the end of this volume, the translator has provided a handy eight-page summary that will tell you what you missed and/or forgot as you slogged in a bleary-eyed daze through Skaldskaparmal and Hattatal.  There's also an alphabetical index of names so you can look up things and use the Edda for what it was intended to be: a reference book. <br />I'm glad I read it, I guess, since I am pretty \\"into\\" this kind of thing ... but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is just curious about Norse mythology.  Sure, this book is \\"the Source\\" but you'll have more fun reading one of the dozens of more recent re-tellings.	2005-05-20

There's definitely more of the supernatural in the Eyrbyggja Saga than in the dozen or so others I have read.  Angry ghosts, sinister omens, strange goings-on.  This is the \\"Amityville Horror\\" of Medeival Literature.  It's a short, quick read (the saga itself is 140 pages, set with relatively large type.)  Some passages are smooth-flowing, very intense page-turners, and some sections seem choppy and confusing.  I'll agree with another reviewer who said that the family relationships and intricate web of who's-fighting-who-for-what-reason are extremely hard to follow, especially in the first third of the story.  The action is very violent; there's a lot of fighting for such a short saga.  The main character, Snorri the Priest, is a mysterious enigma - he's intelligent, sly, and crafty.  He plays \\"close to the vest\\" so nobody is ever quite sure what he's up to.  Even the author is unsure of Snorri's motives.<br /><br />I have a few minor complaints with the editorial handling of this saga.  The chapters have headings which tend to give away what happens.  The introduction should have been an afterword, since it contained far too many spoilers which gave away all the surprises in the story.  If you've read any sagas before, then I recommend skipping the intro and reading it AFTER you've read Eyrbyggja Saga.  If you've never read any sagas, the first 4 pages of the intro will give you a bit of general background, but the rest of it is a plot synopsis and discussion of the saga in sections - best saved til afterwards, when it will be of more help in gaining closure and filling in some of the details of what you've read.	2005-05-11
US	30163399	R22HWCD5QIXJV3	0140447717	27807630	Sagas of Warrior-Poets	Books	4	3	4	N	N	The Title Says it All	It's a collection of five Icelandic Sagas which share thematic similarities:  the main character of each is a skald (poet) and each story contains a troubled love affair.  They were written in the 1200s about semi-historical people and events of the 900s and 1000s (around the time Christianity was adopted in Iceland and Scandinavia.)  One of the sagas (Gunnlaug Serpent-Tongue) is also included in the massive \\"Sagas of Icelanders,\\" which I recommend highly.  However, if you're curious about Icelandic Sagas and are leery of investing in such a huge book, this volume of \\"Warrior-Poets\\" is a good one to start with.  The five sagas are all of manageable length and the plots are neatly focused around the main character of each, which makes for easy reading.  The plain-spoken, efficient saga style of narration can be compared to Hemingway or Hammett and feels quite modern. <br />Sagas were unique in the Middle Ages for being prose narratives in a vernacular language about people who were NOT of the nobility (during a time when literature was dominated by Latin, and by epic poetry whose main characters were of noble blood.)  Though the stories are told in prose, these being sagas of warrior POETS, they are sprinkled generously throughout with verses of skaldic poetry.  The skaldic style was very formal and consisted of lots of \\"kennings\\" which are ways of describing something by allusion and metaphor, without naming the thing itself.  Some kennings are almost like riddles and have to be carefully deciphered (surely listeners in the cultural context of the Viking age understood them much more readily than we do today.)  The translators have opted to render the verses as literally as possible, to preserve their integrity as Poetry.  Explanations of the kennings are printed alongside the verses, to aid in comprehension. <br />The five sagas in this book all share similar themes, although they have differences enough to make each one uniquely enjoyable.  The characters are generally unruly and violent.  Their talent as poets gains them recognition and rewards from kings, but it also gets them into trouble when they can't refrain from composing an insulting verse about their rival.  In each saga, the main character in his youth falls in love with a woman, but for one reason or another he can't marry her right away.   This unfulfilled love, along with the hero's sharp tongue, drives the conflict and provides motivation for an endless series of escalating feuds.  One hero immaturely drags his feet until the girl is married off to someone else, then spends the rest of the story psychotically badgering her and her husband, depriving her of happiness.  In another saga, the hero can't escape the bullying of another man who has hated him (for no apparent reason) since childhood and is constantly hatching cowardly plots against him - including the stealing of his betrothed.  One hero, who is regarded around the neighborhood as a good-for-nothing, makes a deal with his beloved's father to go abroad and make a name for himself, then return to marry the girl after a set period of time.  Of course, he comes home late to find she has been given to another... but he sleeps with her anyway, which sets the husband's vengeance in motion. <br />Even with their melodramatic-sounding plots, these stories don't come across as romances.  \\"Viglund's Saga,\\" the latest one in this collection, has a fairy-tale ambience to it which reflects a Continental influence, but even so it still radiates a stark \\"manliness\\" which is a central trait of the Icelandic Sagas.  The sagas are the most entertaining of Medeival literature, and readers definitely cannot go wrong with this little collection.	2005-05-11

Every kind of trashy, sleazy, paranoid Whitebread-American fantasy is presented here.  Hunky guys in torn shirts being attacked by everything the editors could think of:  giant ants, rabid weasels, Nazis, Japs, native savages, Leopard Women of the Congo, Commie dominatrixes, you name it.  Then there are semi-nude damsels popping out of their tops while being threatened by a similar list of aggressors.  Possibly the best one in terms of ridiculousness shows a chuckling Fidel Castro about to burn a tied-up blonde with his cigar.  These pictures are so outrageous they go beyond offensive into a strange realm of ironic hilariousness.  The only thing more amazing than the subject matter is the fine execution of these paintings.  Every page took my breath away as I marveled at the masterful compositions, the deft use of color and lighting, the absolute mastery of anatomy and proportion.  I doubt there are any illustrators working today who would be capable of producing work of this calibre, regardless of subject matter. <br />My one complaint is that the editor, Adam Parfrey, in his introductions to each section, seems to be defending these covers as a sociological document to be examined from a contemporary Politically-Correct feminist cosmopolitan perspective.  (One reviewer here called it \\"Looney-Left commentary,\\" and I feel that needs clarification.)  Sorry Mr. Parfrey, but there is no defense for this material.  It is what it is, it's horribly Bad and Offensive and Wrong, but it's _SO_ bad it can't be taken seriously.  It's so bad it has become good and can only be enjoyed in the way one enjoys B-movies - by laughing at them, because Now We Know Better. <br />Most of the introductory material in the front of the book was interesting and informative:  a few interviews and reminescences of what it was like to work on the magazines in their heyday.  But Parfrey's article was mostly the kind of art critic / social critic mumbo-jumbo which hides a lack of ideas behind a fog of contemporary academic jargon.  As I read it, I suspected I was actually reading nothing ... and in the final paragraph, when he used \\"traction\\" as a verb, my suspicions were confirmed.  Mr. Parfrey has nothing of value to say, but he did put together a really great collection of jaw-dropping cover art, and I thank him for that.  This book is worth getting.	2005-05-11

Far too many symbols (about a dozen) have \\"meaning uncertain\\" in their definitions.  What's the purpose of including symbols in a dictionary if you don't know what they mean?  That's unhelpful.  Several modern symbols are missing from the book.  This may be due to its original Swedish publication date of 1974.  The most glaring omission is the famous \\"NO\\" sign (circle with diagonal line across it) which is not mentioned at all in the section with symbols of similar construction.   It's obvious the author's major interests were in astrology, alchemy, and mysticism.  Many definitions are shallow and incomplete, but the astrological symbol definitions contain an overabundance of information far beyond what is pertinent to the meaning of the symbol.  It's not necessary to describe the personality traits of Aries and list which planets are auspicious and which are unfortunate in that sign.  All Liungman needed to do was say \\"astrological symbol for Aries\\" and perhaps give the dates when the sun is in that part of the sky.  His ramblings are interesting at times - I did not know that the five-pointed star was discovered by plotting the recurrent appearances of Venus, and that information does add to my understanding of the symbol and its use.  But in the same definition (which is 5 1/2 pages long) Liungman goes into a rant about Judeo-Christian patriarchal society as opposed to ancient Mesopotamian goddess-cults, all of which is impertinent to the use and meaning of the symbol supposedly under discussion.  Many other definitions contain seemingly anti-Christian criticism which is not relevant, not objective, and not professional.  Those of us familiar with history are aware of the crimes perpetrated by the Church.  As a Christian, I'm justly embarrased by my faith's ignoble past, but Liungman's opinions about it seem out-of-place in what is supposed to be a factual dictionary of the meanings of symbols. <br />Complaints aside, the book was- overall - quite informative and interesting to read.  Information about the basic elements of symbols really makes it possible to use this book to create new symbol combinations.  A chapter of the introduction discusses the possibility of an international ideographic language.  The method of organization in the dictionary itself was ingenious, and easy to use once you figure out Liungman's system.  Symbols are organized into groups depending on whether they are symmetric, are open or closed, contain straight or curved lines, and contain crossing lines.  There are 54 possible combinations of these variables, which make up the 54 \\"groups\\" of symbols in the Dictionary.  Most are extensively cross-referenced to other signs with similar meanings or structures.  There's a word index in the back, so you can find symbols based on their meaning.  There's also a symbol index and a chart which you can use to analyze a symbol and figure out which group it will be in.  A few symbols seemed mis-classified but overall I found the system to be very useful.  Out of the 5 or 6 symbol dictionaries I've looked at, this is the one most useful for actually \\"looking up\\" an unknown symbol - which brings this one out of the class of \\"coffee-table book for casual browsing\\" and into the realm of \\"working reference book.\\"	2005-05-05

Its simple prose flows along, following the action without a lot of chivalric fluff.  There's much more detail in the story and the characters are more believably defined, with motivations slightly different than in the Nibelungenlied.  The Volsung Saga is still sketchy at times and contains some abrupt jumps and spots where it seems something is \\"missing\\" but overall this is a MUCH more coherent telling of the Nibelung legend.  And it's the version most people expect when they turn to the medeival sources:  Wagner drew more from the Volsung Saga than he did from the Nibelungenlied for his Ring Cycle of operas.  It's a slim book, a very fast & easy read, and I'd recommend it for anyone who's interested in  medeival literature and European folklore.  The intro is interesting and provides some useful and thought-provoking information about the possible history of the saga.  What were the momentous events that passed into collective memory to become the popular Nibelung legend which was known and re-told all over northern Europe?  The translator suggests some possibilities which make the saga an even more tantalizing read.	2005-03-23

Subject - verb relationships are sometimes confusing.  Word order is not a major issue in an inflected language like Old Norse, but in English it makes a huge difference.  Hollander's literal translation requires very close reading at times in order to make sense of it.  He also uses a LOT of archaisms, some of which are defined in a very brief glossary at the end, but some of which he apparently expects his reader to look up in an unabridged dictionary.  This translation sounds good read aloud, but often I got the feeling that I needed to translate the translation!  I already own the recent (2004) Dover reprint of the 1923 Bellows translation, which is much more readable, but it's only the first half of the Edda (the mythological poems.)  I wanted to read the REST of the Edda, so when I spotted this at the bookstore I grabbed it. <br />There's a general introduction at the beginning, a brief introduction before each poem, and extensive footnotes running at the bottom of each page.  You will need to read all of this in order to fully understand the poems.  The first half consists of stories of the Norse gods and some of their doings.  Probably the most famous Eddic poem is the \\"Voluspa\\" which relates a prophetic vision of the doom of the gods.  The second half of the Edda contains poems about the deeds of legendary heroes.  Most of them center around the Niflung/Nibelung legend.  The Edda is a much more satisfying read than the Nibelungenlied (which I found to be a major disappointment.) <br />All in all, I would recommend the Poetic Edda to anyone with an interest in medeival literature (or an interest in Wagner or Tolkien) ... but I don't think this particular translation is the best one to get.	2005-03-16

In my early days I was haunted by the feeling that underneath Lovecraft's fiction were hints of something horribly TRUE, that his work has endured not only because of its artistic merits, but because he had somehow synthesized his voracious reading and vivid dreaming into content that tapped into archetypal sources of human fear.  I spent a lot of time hunting for books he mentioned in his stories on his occultist characters' shelves - to ascertain for myself how much of what Lovecraft told was the \\"truth\\" and how much he made up - and I found, much to my relief, that many of those books do not exist. <br />But a few of them do:  The Golden Bough, The Witch Cult in Western Europe ... and the Necronomicon.  I actually own a number of published books claiming to be \\"the Necronomicon.\\"  There's a list of them in The Necronomicon Files, and I was amused to note that I own most of the publications on that list.  I realized early on that none of these books are actually THE Necronomicon from Lovecraft's stories.  That book isn't real, never was, and never will be.  The question that remained for me was:  how \\"real\\" are the various Necronomicons that are floating around out there? <br />The answer to that question, (at least as far as regards the notorious \\"Simon\\" edition - now published by Avon,) according to Harms and Gonce, is \\"real enough to be dangerous in the hands of the foolish.\\"  Gonce's section of this book is a wealth of information on the history and theory of Magick.  Even if I hadn't been interested in the Necronomicon, this section would still be fascinating to read.  I learned a lot of things I never would have even thought about before.  The Necronomicon legend is lovingly debunked, but the mystical allure and spiritual danger of the book, whatever it is, are still preserved after reading The Necronomicon Files. <br />The listing of movies and TV shows was amusing but not useful from my perspective.  I've seen more than a few \\"Lovecraft-inspired\\" movies and was so disappointed by each and every one of them that I have given up on the celluloid version of the HPL mythos.	2005-02-26

The quality and coherence of the tales varies.  Some of them are well-told with good narrative flow and consisent, well-defined characters.  Others are a confused jumble of seemingly random incidents which end abruptly with major conflicts still unresolved.  Jeffrey Gatz's translation is plain and readable; nowhere near as murky or as dry as some translated \\"classics\\" I have struggled through. I noticed a slight change in tone from the gentle Celtic lilt in the first half of the book, to frequent use of Beowulf-like compounds (\\"ferocious-bold\\" \\"venomous-painful\\" \\"fierce-powerful\\" etc) in the Arthurian tales of the second half.  Could it be that in the Arthurian romances, an intentionally archaic style was used by the writer?  Dr. Gantz doesn't specifically mention this, though he does say that some of the vocabulary in the Mabinogion was obsolete even at the time it was written.  An air of mystery and magic pervades all the stories.<br /><br />The tales of the Mabinogion were paraphrased by T.W. Rolleston in his _Celtic Myths and Legends_, 1917 (still available from Dover,) so I was already somewhat familiar with them when I read them.  The full versions are much better, and being already familiar with the plot did not diminish my enjoyment at all.  The Mabinogion has many parallels with Irish myth and legend.  It also contains some of the earliest versions of tales from the King Arthur mythos (even a primitive, very understated version of the Grail legend!)  \\"The Dream of Rhonabwy\\" (placed by Gantz in the middle of the book to serve as a transition from the mythological tales to the Arthurian tales) contains one of the best contemporary descriptions of Medeival squalor I have ever read.  You can almost smell the filth and feel the discomfort of Rhonabwy and his companions as you read the opening passages of this tale.<br /><br />Gantz's introductory materials are brief and to the point.  He provides a general introduction at the beginning which gives the historical background of the Mabinogion and puts it into its literary perspective alongside the French romances.  There are a few paragraphs before each tale which provide background information pertinent to that particular story.are brief and to the point.

I'd never read a saga before, but the Poetic Edda had convinced me that I would enjoy anything Norse or Icelandic.  Sagas of Icelanders is a huge, bulky book.  To get a book that size at such a reasonable price was a bargain I could not pass up.  The introductory material helps put a historical perspective on the sagas and prepares you for what to expect ... then the fun starts with Egil's Saga, which is the longest and possibly best in this collection.  Other reviewers have lamented the absence of Njal's Saga here - it is published seperately and was probably too long to include in this collection.  (Based on what folks have said though, I'm going to have to get Njal's Saga.) <br />I am now a saga addict!  I devoured this book with amazing eagerness; each story is an engrossing page-turner.  I just couldn't stop reading them.  The style is intentionally simple with an economy of words and an emotional starkness that reminds me of Dashiell Hammett.  There's no chivalric nonsense or courtly fanciness to be found here.  The storytellers do not attempt to flatter their audience or paint their characters in a more positive light.  Characters are tragically stubborn, stupid, violent, irrational, sometimes even psychotic.  They can also be strong, noble, just, independent, faithful, practical, and hardy.  The sagas have a \\"just the facts\\" attitude that is unique in Medeival literature.  They are also unique in being epic-length prose instead of poetry, and having secular subject matter.  I have to wonder - these monumental works, produced in the Christian era but portraying semi-historical pagan characters in a sympathetic light - how did they get written?  Who wrote them and why?  Who was the intended audience?  This is the mystery of the sagas when the indroduction refers to them as a \\"literary Stonehenge.\\" <br />The world of the sagas is violent.  There's plenty of killing - sometimes for no apparent reason, but usually it's an act of revenge for a wrong, real or perceived.  One reviewer with an axe to grind has condemned this book as a \\"distorted view\\" of Icelandic history, but I think he misses the point of the collection.  It's not meant to be an accurate history; it's a sampler of Medeival sagas.  Consider how \\"accurate\\" a collection of two-fisted detective novels would be as history of early 20th-century America.  Literature is supposed to entertain.  Who wants to read about Grimwald the Meek who just stays on his farm and lives peacefully for 50 years?  That's not interesting.  The sagas are about interesting people who did remarkable things. <br />But - again, strange for Medeival literature - most of the saga characters are NOT of noble blood.  They are often members of wealthy and influential families, but seldom are they royalty.  People in the sagas are not afraid to get their hands dirty.  They make their fortunes by working, trading (and going on Viking raids.)  You won't find Romance cliche's of idle kings and queens and knights here.  King Harald of Norway shows up often, but he's certainly not presented as much more than a successful warlord, and usually a tyrant. <br />I was surprised but not especially disappointed to find a lack of \\"mythology\\" in the sagas.  There's a little bit of magic here and there, and a ghost or two, but little is said of the gods and even less of nature spirits, dragons, fairies, etc.  Compared to Celtic tales (like the ones in the Mabinogion, for instance) the sagas are firmly grounded in reality. <br />One other caution:  I found myself sometimes bewildered by the Icelandic names and I had difficulty keeping track of who was who.  Most sagas tell a story of several generations of a family, and sons are named after grandfathers, and neighbors have the same names, and after a while you're floundering in a sea of Thorvalds and Thorgrims and Thorsteins and Snorris, etc etc ... and each one of them is a son of another Thorvald, Thorgrim, Thorstein, or Snorri and you lose track of who is who.  I had to do some page-flipping sometimes to look back and re-establish who a character was and what he had done earlier.  But other than that this was a quick and enjoyable read. <br />It's interesting, it's huge, it's affordable:  If you don't buy it there's something wrong with you!	2005-02-24

The real Nibelungenlied, for the most part, lacks the \\"balls\\" of Wagner.  However, the amazingly bloody fight scene at the end is memorable and masterfully composed. <br />Hatto's prose translation is readable but sort of flat.  It has a fairy-tale lilt to it at times, which more often than not comes across sounding juvenile. <br />The story consists of two distinct sections with decidedly different flavors, indicating that the poet composed it out of two pre-existing stories that didn't exactly fit together.  The first part deals with the wooing of Brunhilde and the death of Sigfried.  A wealth of detail from other versions of this story is unfortunately left out, and Sigfried's earlier career is completely skipped over.  We're simply told in a few lines that he slew a dragon and conquered the Nibelungs, gaining posession of their vast treasure along with a magic cloak and impenetrable skin.  Brunhilde is consumed with jealousy when Sigfried marries Kriemhild, but because of the poet's ham-fisted tampering with his sources, the \\"real\\" reason of her jealousy has to be substituted with something lame and irrational. <br />The second half of the Nibelungenlied tells of Kriemheld's grisly revenge for the murder of Sigfried.  This part is well written, but oddly the characters metamorphose so that the villain of the first half (Sigfried's muderer) is the hero in the second half (a stalwart victim of a woman's treachery.) <br />The story is bogged down throughout with chivalric courtly nonsense, undoubtedly thrown in for the gratification of the poet's royal patron.  After reading some Icelandic sagas, the characters' behaviour in the Nibelungenlied seems painfully artificial. <br />I'm also puzzled as to why this work bears the title \\"Nibelungenlied\\" since it really isn't about the Nibelungs at all.  It doesn't tell the story of Sigfried's conquest of Nibelungland and the winning of the legendary treasure.  The Nibelungs show up briefly in the story as an army which Sigfried has at his disposal, and nothing more.  In the second half, the Burgundians are inexplicably referred to as \\"Nibelungs\\" but this just doesn't make sense after referring in the first half to the Nibelungs as a seperate people in a seperate land (a seemingly otherworldly land.  There's a dim sense that the Nibelungs might be \\"fairy folk,\\" perhaps like the Tuatha De Danann in Celtic myth.)  The title is a cheat, and I think it's misleading.  But it is the traditional title of this epic. <br />The afterword provides in-depth critical analysis and profuse apologies for the epic's many flaws.  Reading this helps greatly towards better understanding of the poem, and also puts you on the track of parallel sources of the Nibelung legend, some of which Prof. Hatto briefly summarizes.  I need to find the Norse \\"Thidrekssaga\\" which fills in many exciting details of Sigfried's early career and the truth about his relationship with Brunhilde. <br />I've also heard that the Volsung Saga is a much better telling of the story.  Though I haven't yet read it, based on what I know of sagas I'm willing to bet it will be a much more satisfying experience. <br />All in all, I can't recommend the Nibelungenlied to anyone unless they have a real serious thirst for Medeival literature.	2005-02-24

Something about HPL's writing strikes a chord - even though it's cheesy, something about it feels TRUE, and that's scary ... so I started chasing down his sources, to read what he had read, in order to make sense of the feelings his writing evokes.  The Golden Bough was the first one I found, probably because it is still widely available and can be found in most bookstores.  HPL always put it on his doomed occultist characters' bookshelves alongside the Necronomicon, \\"The Witch Cult in Western Europe\\" (which does exist and can be bought here at Amazon!), and the \\"Unausprechlichen Kulten\\" of Von Juntz. <br />In the \\"Golden Bough\\" Sir Frazer takes the basic premise of explaining the strange rite of succession of the priest at Nemi, and uses it as a launch-pad to go into a long, drawn-out discussion of the roots of magic and superstition, and how so-called \\"primitive\\" beliefs have been common to all cultures in a certain stage of their development, all over the world. <br />The subject matter is fascinating, but Frazer's writing style is very dry, very British, very turn-of-the-(20th)century academic ... and he rambles.  Some chapters he seems to be lost on a sidetrack, distracted by the unending cascade of interesting facts and anecdotes, but ultimately he returns to the main idea just when you thought he had lost it forever.  The contrast between the \\"holy crap\\" amazement of what he's telling you and the soothing, hypnotic monotone of his written voice actually gives me a strangely pleasant tingling  sensation along my spine after about 15 minutes of reading. <br />Of course I don't expect everyone (or anyone at all, for that matter) to have such a visceral reaction, but most readers with any interest in the shadowy depths of human thought and spirituality will enjoy this book immensely.	2005-01-17

Readers will realize early on that this book was an inspiration to Lovecraft.  Undoubtedly this is where he got the idea for the international Cthulhu cult in \\"Call of Cthulhu,\\" and he probably turned to it often as a reference to give an air of authenticity to witchcraft rituals and 17th-century pastiches in his stories. <br />However, even to the obsessive fan hellbent on tracking down HPL's sources, this book has limited appeal.  Unlike the \\"Golden Bough,\\" \\"Witch Cult\\" does not have a strong thesis and doesn't seem to have any purpose beyond presenting fragments of court records from witch trials and grouping them together in chapters based on their thematic content.  Many of Ms. Murray's sources are French, and she presents them in French, without any translation.  You get the feeling that you just missed something potentially interesting, in some spots probably someting salacious or naughty, unless you can read French.  I can't, so I wound up frustrated a lot. <br />The rest of Ms. Murray's sources are in \\"English,\\" but they were written in the glorious days of the 1600s, before standardized spelling, and apparently before grammar had been invented.  One example that pops into my mind:  \\"quohome\\" as a way to spell \\"whom.\\"  If you have trouble reading the King James Bible, if Shakespeare leaves you shrugging your shoulders in pure bafflement, then avoid this book like the plague.  You won't comprehend 50 percent of it. <br />For some reason Ms. Murray could not paraphrase, translate, or modernize her source material like Sir Frazer did; she presents it always \\"as is\\" in the original language and leaves the reader to puzzle out the meaning.  Thankfully she assails us with numerous examples for each point.  If one piece of evidence will do, then 25pieces all saying the same thing, will do even better!  So after you've slogged through all of them, you kinda can get the gist. <br />Much of the information presented here (the part of it that can be deciphered, anyway) is really quite fascinating despite Murray's attempt to make it bland and boring, and if you have a serious interest in the subject of Witchcraft and its history, this book is worth having.  All of the information in it can be found elsewhere, but not all in one place. <br />I'm also taking away a star for the physical presentation of this particular volume from Kessinger Publishing.  It looks like it was made on the cheap, at Kinko's.  The cover is generic, and the pages are obviously scanned from an old edition and printed on sheets that are too big for it, leaving the text floating awkwardly on the page, and making the book too big, floppy, and ungainly.  Plus it was too expensive.  Dover can print this kind of thing (and even cut the pages to the right size) and sell it for about half the price.  Why are Kessinger editions so costly?	2005-01-17

I must also confess that at this moment I have only made my way through half of volume 1.  I feel it necessary to give potential buyers a \\"heads up\\" about this set:  it is, as described, a massive work of mid-1800s scholarship.  It was assumed at that time that anyone who would be reading such a work would be able to read Latin as well as Old High German, Old Norse, Anglo-Saxon, and a smattering of other medeival languages. <br />The author spends most of his time NOT telling mythical stories as the curious dabbler might expect, but instead chasing down obscure linguistic clues imbedded in medeival texts, place names, and quaint figures of speech in an attempt to reconstruct some sort of Germanic mythology (for which documentation is lacking) from its hypothetical parallels in Norse mythology (for which documentation is abundant) and the mythologies / religious beliefs / superstitions of surrounding races such as the Saxons, the Gauls, even the Greeks and Romans.  This process is dull, dry, tedious, and to someone not fluent in Classical and Germanic languages, incomprehensible.  If you love philology you will love these books, but if you want to be thrilled by tales of the Old Gods, stay away!!  Herr Grimm does not tell many stories; all the cool stuff is quoted from his sources, and whatever of that isn't in Old High German is in Latin.  _Untranslated_ Latin.  BEWARE!! <br />Don't get me wrong; I do not regret owning this set, and I have every intention of finishing it - I'm just saying it's going to be unexpectedly difficult for me, and I can only recommend it for those with a Serious Interest in the subject.  The information Grimm presents here is dense and staggeringly thorough - and it is, in a way, a very enjoyable read:  the book has its own soporific charm which provides an almost physical pleasure from reading it.  An entire mysterious world of unknown language and dimly-comprehended episodes from Latin chroniclers yawns before me.  Should be a fun trip. <br />Nevertheless, my review must bear a mere 3 stars as a warning to those who only want to be thrilled by the mighty adventures of Thor:  look elsewhere.  This is not the right book for you to start.	2005-01-17

This is not a \\"Tarot\\" deck.  It is an \\"Encyclopedic\\" deck representing a model of the universe.  The number of cards, their symbolism, their organisation, and the way they are used are all very different from a standard Tarot.  This deck consists of 50 cards, in 5 groups of 10, and they gradually go up in rank, from #1, \\"The Wretch,\\" all the way  to #50 \\"The Divine Light,\\" the Source of All Things.  Group 1 (cards 1-10) are the \\"Human Conditions\\" which depict various strata of rank & prestige in late Medeival society.  Next (cards 11-19) are the \\"Muses\\" representing forms of artistic expression, ruled by #19, Apollo, the Prince of Knowledge.  Cards 21-30 are the \\"Arts and Sciences\\" the general fields of study in Medeival academia.  31-40 are \\"Geniuses and Virtues,\\" which starts with Intellect, Senses, Vital Functions, and the seven virtues.  The last 10 cards are the seven Planets, the Upper Heavens, Prime Mover, and Divine Light. <br /> <br />The artwork is excellent, the symbolism is valid, the deck is actually quite fascinating, but I can't give it any more than 3 stars because the publishers have insisted on calling it a \\"Tarot\\" when it isn't.

Ring-bound so it lies open flat.  Thumb tabs for each chapter (though perhaps tabs for each suit would have been even MORE useful.)  It has full-color pictures from dozens of different decks, which enables you to see how the same card has been depicted by various artists - something very handy which I have not seen in any other book.  Card descriptions are thorough and accurate.  You really couldn't go wrong with this book. <br />The reason I took away a star, though, is this:  the interpretations are just a bit too \\"positive, self-affirming, upbeat\\" even for the gloomiest cards, like in the suit of swords.  It's almost as if the author has intentionally shied away from telling us anything unpleasant or scary ... but sometimes the cards do have grim warnings to give.  Also, I incorporate inversions into my readings (if a card appears upside-down in a spread, that changes its meaning) which is a subject Ms Lionnet does not even touch. <br /> <br />So, I give this one 4 stars because it's handy, well-designed, useful ... but not _quite_ complete.	2004-12-25

All the other reviewers have already said it:  this book is absoluteley amazing and the price .. I feel almost guilty paying so little for it.  This book is a treasure of the ages.  I didn't know much about alchemy when I bought it (though the subject is one that has always interested me.)  Reading it was a long, slow, contemplative journey.  There's a vast wealth of information there, between the glorious pictures and the intelligent captions, the thoughtful text at the beginning of each section ... It seems alchemy is not merely a materialistic quest for profit by turning cheap metals into gold; the true goal of \\"philosophical\\" alchemy was to turn the alchemist himself into spiritual gold, in other words, to obtain enlightenment.  It's a quest to find God, and many of its principles cannot be explained in words.  Many of its secrets cannot be told except in cryptic hints and mysterious symbols, because discovering the key for yourself is part of the journey.  Reading this book feels almost like taking a few steps down that road, and glimpsing from far away the great Light waiting at the end of it ... <br />This is definitely a \\"must read\\" if you have any interest in metaphysical subjects.	2004-12-25

Deals only with the Major Arcana which is less than half of a full Tarot deck.  Uses a 4-card spread divided in half with a 5th card in the center.  The main body of the book is a list of every possible 2-card combination and what they mean.  It might be useful for somebody totally unfamiliar with the Tarot to sit down and do little fortune-telling, but with this approach you don't even really need cards - you could roll dice to generate random numbers and look them up in the book. <br /> <br />I wouldn't recommend this one to anybody who wants to learn the symbolism of the Tarot (using a full deck, perhaps) and be able to actually interpret them in a reading.	2004-12-25

(He stole the name and vague concept of Hastur from it.)  The frustrating thing about RW Chambers is that he COULD write very well, but for some reason he usually didn't.  At his best he could weave an atmosphere of terrifying hallucinatory brilliance.  At his worst he was hokey, sentimental, sappy, and tiresome.  Half of his original _The King in Yellow_ consists of dopey romance stories that will infuriate the wierd fiction fan.  Not so here.  This Dover collection has only the best tales from _The King in Yellow_, as well as a number of other chilling morsels picked from Chambers' large body of later (mostly forgettable) work. <br />You should get hold of this collection just for \\"The Repairer of Reputations,\\" which ranks as a superior masterpiece of surreal paranoid delirium.  It's one of the top 5 wierd stories of all time, and actually BETTER than anything by Lovecraft.	2004-12-25

This book is NOT the one to get. <br /> <br />Though I have found the Rider-Waite deck to be the most accurate and useful, A.E. Waite's explanation of it leaves much to be desired.  One gets the impression from leafing through this volume, that Mr. Waite knew very well what he was talking about, but was frustratingly unable to convey it in plain language for the layman.  The card descriptions are loaded down with mystical mumbo-jumbo that perhaps made sense to an initiate of the Golden Dawn, but is going to leave a modern Tarot dabbler scratching his head in perplexity.  Even in the chapters where Waite presents simple divinatory meanings for each card (the same as what's printed in the little booklet that comes with the Rider deck) the interpretations seem arbitrary since Waite does not sufficiently explain WHY the card would mean that.  Many of the possible interpretations are wildly contradictory, and I have found some of them to be inaccurate and misleading.  Overall not a very helpful book.	2004-12-25

The authorities included are:  Angeles Arrien, Norma Cowie, Aliester Crowley, Pamela Eakins, Gail Fairfield, Mary Greer, Vicki Noble, Rachel Pollack, Jana Riley, Juliet Shurman-Burke, RJ Stewart, AE Waite, Barbara Walker, Dr James Wanless, and Oswald Wirth.  I have found that Fairfield tends to be way out in left field, and Wanless & Riley are sometimes questionable, but overall this book is an invaluable reference and should be part of any Tarot student's library.  ...Because it _IS_ an entire Tarot library, digested in one volume.	2004-12-25

You don't need to read these chapters; they are unimportant.  The section about the Grail Hallows was completely irrelevant and sounded made-up.  The real meat of this book is the individual card descriptions.  The black&white illustrations of the cards are pretty atrocious, but they get the idea across ... more importantly, you get 1 to 3 pages of info about each card, describing what is traditionally depicted on it, magickal & astrological correspondences, and what the symbols are supposed to mean.  He also gives a basic divinatory interpretation for each card (with a seperate interpretation for the \\"inversed\\" or upside-down card, which I use.)  Dee's writing is very straightforward and easy to understand.  I have checked his correspondences and his interpretations against other sources, and they are correct.  In actual practice I have found Dee's interpretations to be more useful and accurate than Waite or Crowley, and thus _Tarot Mysteries_ has become THE book I turn to first if I have a question.	2004-12-25

Now that my tastes have matured somewhat I've gotten interested in Medeival legendry and epic poems.  The Rebsamen translation is a good choice - it has an authentic rythm to it and begs to be read aloud.  The translator has made up odd compound words to convey the meaning and the flavor of the Old English original (\\"woodsong\\" for the sound of a harp is a good example.)  Following the form of Old English poetry, lines are divided into somewhat disjointed phrases presenting a series of vivid, tersely described images rather than a coherent narrative flow.  Nevertheless, the poem rolls right along and I was delighted by the aptness of the language at times:  wierd off-kilter phrases that somehow perfectly convey the action in tiny glimpses.  This is powerful epic poetry. <br />Beowulf purists will be upset because Rebsamen drifts quite a bit from the Old English original (he admits in the Introduction that he had to move phrases around, sometimes placing a half-line 4 or 6 lines away from where it was, and swapping pieces here and there in order to accomplish the proper alliteration and still retain some logical sense.)  He has taken liberties with the poem, but I think that's forgivable considering the results.  This translation is not for academics and Beowulf scholars.  It's for everyday shmoes like you and me who want something exciting to read.	2004-12-24

The style is charming and readable, and there's a wealth of information to pursue.  Guearber does some editorializing here and there, and the final chapter which attempts to draw parallels to Greco-Roman mythology was a waste of time.  One clue that Guerber did not spend much time doing actual research is that she used Roman names for the \\"Greek\\" gods in that final chapter.  I'm not familiar enough with Norse mythology to point out errors there, but several reviewers here on Amazon were outraged by Guerber's inaccuracy ... I consider this a good book to start a study of Norse mythology;  it's an easy read, and if nothing else at least it tells you what to look for as you continue your reading elsewhere.  This should NOT be your _only_ book about Norse myth.  Definitely further research is needed since Guerber is not a completely reliable source herself.	2004-12-24

First published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1923.  It's a slow read, primarily because almost every page is crammed with footnotes.  The translation seems pretty good - it attempts to imitate the form of the Old Norse poetry, and the language at times is very moving with vivid imagery and sonic resonance.  The abundant footnotes bog down the reading, but they are necessary since the Eddic poems were originally composed for an audience already familiar with Norse mythology.  I went into this book knowing nothing about the subject, and by the time I had finished, with the help of Mr. Bellows' notes along the way, I had developed a real thirst for more.  Somewhat difficult reading, but for somebody with a literary bent this is an excellent introduction to the world of Norse legendry.  It certainly begs a second reading, ignoring the footnotes and just enjoying the poetry.	2004-12-24

In 1917 certainly he meant no harm, but in hindsight that kind of talk makes a modern reader shudder.  Other than that, I found the book to be a useful, workmanlike overview of Celtic history and legendry.  Most surprising and enlightening to me were the Invasion legend cycles and a chapter discussing the \\"megalith people\\" and the mysterious dolmens, henges, and barrows that dot the countryside.  Nice also to see authentic Celtic and Cymric names in the text, and a pronunciation guide at the back of the book.  The writing style is dry and elegant, like most scholarly works of that time period ... I've struggled through much duller material, so I did not find it difficult.  I noticed however, that Rolleston has a tendency to change verb tenses between paragraphs while telling a story, which really distracted me every time it happened:  \\"Finn went here, did this, was ready for battle,\\" and then suddenly to present tense \\"Finn is standing alone looking across the river.  He challenges whoever.\\"  Tense changes are jarring, and that's something they taught us NOT TO DO in elementary school.  I'm surprised an academic writer in the early 20th century could get away with it.  Where was his editor? <br />The tales in this book are told very briefly, with much of the interesting detail stripped away or skipped over (\\"here a long passage of curious adventures brings the characters to the gates of the dun...\\")  Sometimes I got the feeling Rolleston was writing for an audience that was already familiar with the material he was presenting.  Frequently names pop up with no explanation of who they are, leaving you to flip frantically back to see if you missed something. <br />Overall, this is a pleasant introduction to get you started on an exploration of Celtic lore.  It'll whet the appetite of the merely curious but you will need to seek out other sources to flesh out the bare-bones version of the tales Rolleston presents here.	2004-12-24

However, the actual \\"Demoniality\\" is easy reading.  It's fairly short and a motivated reader could finish it in the space of an afternoon.  Sinistrari covers his topic clearly and concisely, using logic and precedents of Catholic Doctrine to make his case.  At the very beginning he clarifies the meaning of the title:  as opposed to \\"bestiality\\" which is sexual intercourse with animals, \\"demoniality\\" refers to sexual intercourse with demons.  This topic would have been an important one for Sinistrari, as a Consultator to the Supreme Tribunal of the Holy Inquisition, to elucidate.  In many cases, fornication with demons was part of the witches' sabbats and alleged dealings with the Devil, and this was a heinous crime - consisting as it did not only of sexual aberration, but also of \\"offence against religion.\\"  However, in many instances men and women were visited noctournally (and sometimes even harrassed in broad daylight) by Incubi and Succubi who were just interested in sex and did not demand any oath of allegiance or abandonment of the Church.  These cases would still carry the stigma of a sexual offence, but not the taint of heresy.  Sinistrari then goes on to postulate the existence of demons (in the sense of the original Greek word \\"daimon,\\" meaning \\"wise one\\") which are not diabolical or intrinsically evil, but are instead a race of mortal, semi-corporeal, intelligent beings who exist alongside man but are generally invisible to us.  Sinistrari proves this theory is not contrary to established Church doctrine and clarifies how  crimes of fornication with these demons, or \\"lutins,\\" should be defined.<br /><br />A few complaints:  apparently Kessinger Publishing only prints in one size.  This is a facsimile edition, meaning they photographed (or probably scanned) the 1927 Summers edition and printed it as-is without resetting the type.  It looks like it may have been enlarged to fill the 8.25 x 11 inch page, but those dimensions do not match the shape of the original page, which leaves the block of text floating awkwardly in a page that's too big for it.  I have another one of Kessinger's reprints; it's the same size and it was laid-out the same way.  From a design standpoint, this just looks cheap and I feel it detracts from the reading experience.  Too bad Kessinger books are not as cheap as they look!  The price was a bit high, considering how thin this book is, and how poorly designed.  I'd have to say Dover Publishing does a better job with this kind of thing.<br /><br />I'm also not entirely convinced that this book was actually written by Ludovico Maria Sinistrari.  Aside from doing an in-depth textual analysis, there's  no way to prove the authorship.  Sinistrari died in 1701.  According to Montague Summers' introduction, \\"Demoniality\\" was not published until 1875, in a French translation by Isidore Liseux, from the original Latin manuscript which Liseux found in a London bookshop in 1872.  Something about this story sounds fishy.  I'm skeptical, even though this book's theology holds together pretty well, it would take a better scholar than myself to determine whether Sinistrari himself could have actually written it.s-is without resetting the type.
