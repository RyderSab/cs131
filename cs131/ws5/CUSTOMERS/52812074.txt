Maybe.<br />It depends on what it was about _Good in Bed_ that grabbed you. Was it the scathingly witty dialogue? If so, there's less of that here, though _In Her Shoes_ has its moments. But if it was the story of how Cannie learned to love herself and the relationships in her life, you'll go for _In Her Shoes_, which focuses more relationships between the characters. There's a lot more pain in _In Her Shoes_ than in _Good in Bed_ -- a grandmother who hasn't seen her granddaughters since they were children, one sister who's successful at work but unsuccessful in love, the other beautiful but branded stupid, a stepmother who always feels like she's second best. The ending is happy, but there are twists and turns galore in between.<br />Cannie, her daughter, and Nifkin make a brief appearance in the center of the novel, for those who are interested.<br />_In Her Shoes_ is a richer, but in some ways less fun, read than its predecessor -- where _Good in Bed_ was one of the better beach reads in existence, _In Her Shoes_ is for curling up on a couch with on a rainy day.	2002-10-02

Like a collection of bedtime tales, you needn't start at the beginning and go to the end -- you can pick any element you like and enjoy the delicious nuggets of information.<br />The book suffers from a disturbing number of awkward sentences -- it deserves a much better copy editor for the next edition!<br />This won't replace a chemist's CRC Handbook for sheer amounts of data, but unlike CRC it's a heck of a lot of fun to read.	2002-04-19

Back then they were pretty hard to find, and I couldn't find the other two books until six or seven years later.<br />Since then, I've tried Pierce's other series, and they just don't stand up to an adult's reading. _First Test_, like the Daine series, suffers from a distinct lack of subtlety, and I never felt drawn into the story the way I was with Alanna. Nothing much really *happens* to Keladry in her first year as a page. Which might be okay if we were given a deeper, more subtle look into her feelings, but instead it's mostly a repetitive, &quot;She tried to be stone, like a Yamani.&quot; It gets old very fast.<br />While this book may well charm younger readers, unlike the Harry Potter books or Robin McKinley's body of work, they won't stand up to reading by adults.	2001-11-28

For those who merely dabble in cruciverbalism, this book is best left on the shelf. But for those who've done enough crosswords to know Cathy Millhauser from Nancy Salomon, Merl Reagle from Rich Norris, and especially for the budding constructor, &quot;The Crossword Obsession&quot; is a must-have. Constructors and editors from Will Shortz to Trip Payne to Merl Reagle discuss what they love about crosswords, the favorite themes they've done, editors of the past, and more. Though only one chapter is actually labeled as one on tips for constructors, the entire book -- with the exception of the first few pages, which tell the fascinating history of crosswords -- is a mine of ideas and information for aspiring crossword constructors. Those who are hoping for deep insight into just *why* crosswords are such a popular phenomenon -- after all, why do we solvers enjoy frustration so much as to want to do it again? -- will be disappointed. Those who are fascinated with the business of creating and solving crosswords and wonder how it's done will be more than satisfied.	2001-10-21

After going through the first half of it, I am actually beginning to conclude that programming is relatively painless...<br />Schwartz and Phoenix start slow. *Really* slow. I knew a very few Unix commands before opening this book, but that's it. No other programming languages, nothin'. Despite my lack of background, I found &quot;Learning Perl&quot; easy to read, the examples doable, thus keeping me from giving up. (Which, I assure you, I would've done had this been difficult.)<br />So, my guess is that if you already have a smattering of programming, this book may progress too slowly for your taste. But for the absolute beginner, it's great.	2001-10-04

I used this guide when I applied to colleges six years ago.<br />Guess what: the quotes have not changed since then! And now that I have a diploma from one of the colleges profiled in the book, I can see that some of the information (not the opinions, the information) is inaccurate and outdated. The face of a college can change a lot in six years (and who knows if the information was even fresh then?); I would use this as a jumping off point only. I have no idea if the other guides are more frequently updated; seems like a visit is the only way to tell.	2001-09-05

I heartily enjoyed this series of four fairy tales with a twist, though I think the $10 price for each is a bit steep -- don't see why they couldn't have been bound into a single $20 volume. This is my favorite of the four -- a delightfully smart heroine who ends up with her perfect, inquisitive prince. If you love Robin McKinley, you'll enjoy these tales -- lighter and funnier than any of her tales retold, though with less depth.	2001-06-08

Like Weiner's heroine, I am from Philadelphia, went to Princeton, and am a size sixteen, though fortunately I've never had the experience of having my ex-boyfriend write about me in a magazine column. Weiner's novel -- characters, places, and actions -- is absolutely spot on. I felt for Cannie as she took the ...from the skinny girls in high school, had a bad first foray into being single again, and cheered her on as she sold her screenplay and started giving it back to the people who dump on fat people.<br />Her portrayals of Princeton and Philadelphia are ringingly familiar. It is indeed hard to be a fat girl at Princeton, and Weiner portrays the experience with candor and honesty. She obviously knows Philadelphia like the back of her hand, too -- while not a focus of the novel, it's always there, and this Philly girl found the setting quite refreshing.<br />I have not lost sleep over a book -- any book -- in a long time. Thank you, Jennifer Weiner, for reminding me what that feels like.	2001-05-22

I admit that I only got through two and a half chapters or so of this book before tossing it in the garbage. For starters, in the Christianity section Flower misquotes the Lord's Prayer. While &quot;For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever&quot; is part of the prayer for many Christians, it's not in the Bible. Flower, however, cites the add-on as a quote from the Bible! While your average Joe on the street might be excused for the error, I can't see how the same allowance can be made for an author of a book on religions. She also writes on Christianity, &quot;In countries like Africa it is one of the fastest growing of all religions.&quot; The last time I checked, Africa was a continent. Such a quote should not be tolerated in a high school term paper, much less a published book. I'm circular-filing this one.	2001-04-26

Though this is easily the meatiest of the Harry Potter series at over 700 pages, I ripped through it in about six hours -- this is keep-you-up-at-night, extraordinarily engrossing reading. The excitement extends from the fact that Ron and Harry are beginning to notice girls to Harry's vision of his parents (I'll try not to say more for fear of spoiling).<br />My favorite part of this series -- which I began reading on a lark at Christmas to see what all the fuss was about -- is watching Harry Potter *grow up*. I'm 22, and I can remember reading series like *The Baby-Sitter's Club* and *Sweet Valley High* where the characters were eternally eighth graders and high school juniors, respectively. It's completely refreshing to see Harry mature and confront ever more difficult aspects of his past as he gets farther through Hogwarts, yet the fun of the series is absolutely not lost.<br />I'll be first in line, or at least fighting for that position, the day we get to see Harry turn fifteen and start another year.	2001-01-14

This history of Berlin from its time as the Prussian capital to today covers such varied topics as music under the Nazis (I learned some things about Richard Strauss and Herbert von Karajan I hadn't known before!), Wall escape attempts, and the problems of reunification, among others. It's liberally sprinkled with examples of the famous Berliner sense of humor. A great read for the novice or the experienced Berlinophile. My one major grumble: the Cold War era section covers the western half of the city far more extensively than the eastern half. I would have liked to see more about life on the &quot;other side&quot;. Minor quibble: being a first edition, it suffers from a very noticeable number of typos. Still a fantastic introduction -- or reintroduction -- to the city on the Spree.	2000-12-10

From the get-go, this book beats _The Path of Daggers_ hands down, but, perhaps inevitably in a series this long, a few things begin to grind on the nerves. Jordan is a better storyteller than he is a writer (&quot;writer&quot; defined in this sense as &quot;creator of good prose&quot;). He has used certain analogies and metaphors enough now that they wear on the nerves. How many times have we heard Aes Sedai spoken of in superlatives in the earlier books...and then how many times do we hear things like &quot;[Insert name of member of newly introduced social/ethnic group here] could make an Aes Sedai look slovenly/foolish/etc.&quot;? I definitely noticed this in the first few chapters. Which woman or group of women is really the strongest in character? Do we really care by now?<br />This book has more action than TPoD, and yet it still feels strangely anticlimactic, perhaps because so many of the questions that have been plaguing readers for eight books now are answered, with fewer new mysteries to theorize about. Of course, the end of this book is suitably un-put-down-able, as a long-awaited event takes place with RJ's best nail-bitingly tense writing.<br />The story is pretty damn engrossing, and there are some truly stellar scenes, especially Elayne's and Aviendha's first-sister bonding ceremony and another that I won't spoil for you :)<br />I'd put this installment overall on a level somewhere above _Lord of Chaos_ and below _The Great Hunt_.<br />One big quibble: there are way, way too many typos in this book. Makes it look like a rush job, when a few hours with a spell-checker would have fixed many of the problems. (Quite a few simple grammatical errors too.) Was there *really* no time to proofread?	2000-11-09

It might be entertaining for young readers, but this was on the adult fantasy shelves at my bookstore and I picked it up hoping to be enchanted. Unfortunately, unlike _Watership_, the characters are way too one-dimensional, which makes _Redwall_ rather unsatisfying.<br />I might have liked this book better had I not read it right on the heels of _Watership_, or had I read it when I was younger. However, this, unlike the Chronicles of Narnia and other classics, is a book that doesn't satisfy adults as well as children.	2000-10-03

Amy Tan is better known for The Joy Luck Club than this book, but I will always love The Kitchen God's Wife - it is so beautifully realistic in its depiction of both the surroundings and the emotions.  Simply move the  locale from China to Malaysia and you have the story of a close female  relative of mine, so the book really hit home.  The sketches of  Chinese-American families were just close enough to stereotype to be funny,  but so real that I had tears in my eyes along with the laughter.  This is  one of the few books I bothered to buy in hardcover - it certainly takes a  beating from repeated readings.	1999-04-21

But as a text for intro p-chem students...ugh!  Please, can we have some more explanations instead of jumping from place to place without  doing the math in between that really confuses those of us who've never had  it before?

That is, if it weren't so liberally punctuated with the bad humor that has become Eddings' trademark.  We don't really get to know the characters, with the exception of only a  few scenes, and the story is just one rehashing of Belgarath and Polgara  being Great Sorcerers after another.  Boring.  The more he extends a  series, the worse it gets (same with Sparhawk).  So stick with the books  from the beginning.	1998-11-14

The villains really are very one-dimensional, and even the two protagonists are  sometimes shallow and artificial.  I think the dialogue between them is  often stilted and could have flowed a little better.  An interesting  retelling of Beauty and the Beast, but go to Robin McKinley for more depth.	1998-11-14

Why does it seem like this whole series has so many gratuitous moments, like the monster vs. Zalasta scene?  The characters start evidencing the not-that-funny one-liners that plague Eddings, but in this book they're not  so bad - the rest of the series, however, will make your teeth ache with  them.  If you've read the Elenium (which was way better), you might want to  read this just to find out what happens to Sparhawk and company.  Don't.   You can probably imagine a better sequel yourself.	1998-11-11

Meaning, why does he start with a decent &quot;let's find the blue rock&quot; story (the Elenium, the Belgariad), and then follow it up with what seems like an exercise in being as  farfetched as possible (the Tamuli, the Malloreon)?!  He just tries to pull  more ideas out and they're just TOO fanciful, even for fantasy.  And, of  course, all the characters have to deliver their dialogue as one-liners  that really aren't that funny.  In particular I would LOVE to have Caalador  killed off to get rid of that ridiculous dialect (and all the characters  who decide to imitate it).  And the ending just wasn't that convincing.   Stick with the Elenium - the best series Eddings has written, in my  opinion.  The one-liners are there, but not as many of them, and there are  some serious characters to balance the overly witty ones.  Plus the story  is fantasy, yet not the totally farfetched stuff of the Tamuli.	1998-11-11

It does still manage to hold my attention more than just about every other fantasy novel I've read.  But it's not as good as the beginning.  In the first two or three books, Nynaeve was a character to admire for her courage and complexity - her silent love affair with Lan and the way she dispensed justice to the Seanchan sul'dam made her my favorite character of the series.  But now she has been reduced to a squabbling, annoying whiner.  Of course arguing makes her more human, but over and over again?  It just gets on my nerves.  Give me back the pre-White Tower flight Nynaeve, please!	1998-08-10

Well, this isn't one of them.  I read it for the first time when I was maybe 14 and loved it, but since then have moved on to more involved fantasy.  This book should have been extended to a  short series maybe - then Anthony might have developed his characters more thoroughly and, as another reviewer pointed out, had them use their gifts more.  And the ending seemed like so much proselytizing - yes, I believe the Holocaust was horrible and of course I don't like to see a dead deer in the street, but I also don't need to have that preached at me when I'm reading a fantasy novel.  Aren't they called fantasy because they're an escape from the real world?  Oh, and I think Piers Anthony should keep his Author's Notes to himself.  Some of us I think would like his writing better if he didn't feel the need to be so explicit about his motives.  When he writes about the q! ! uestion of getting paid on this - the collaboration with a dead teenager - well, sure, we know authors like to get paid.  But when he puts it in the author's note, it's, like, cry me a river!  The boy is dead!  You're alive!  And all you're worrying about is getting paid?!  And I'm sure his collaborator's family loved reading that.  All in all, an average book.   Save your time and go read something like Ann Marston's Rune Blade trilogy.	1998-07-16

I'm not sure why that is. I would have preferred to get more deeply inside the heads of the characters than I did.

It seemed like the author thought that by adding a few spells to the French Revolution, she would have a great story.  But give me a real French Revolution novel any day - the characters didn't come to life for me in this one.  Magic is great, but only if the characters have substance - it can't carry a novel.

And this book is no exception.  I've seen much better from both Lackey and Anthony.  OK, I agree, I have read much worse fantasy than this, but I expected better from authors of their caliber.  I also found Anthony's Author's Note particularly obnoxious - he describes how he basically had Lackey write a book on his idea, then finished it off by adding a beginning and ending and polishing it to his usual standards.  But it's NOT up to his usual standards.  Stick with either author by him/herself, you'll enjoy the reading a lot more.	1998-07-01

Anthony didn't mean to write this one when he began the series, and it shows.  To me this seemed more like a disjointed collection of anecdotes meant to show how Satan was behaving during all the other books rather than a flowing story.

Terrible because, like way too many pop songbooks, it falls apart almost immediately.  Spiral binding is ugly, but I wish they would use it - then these books would last longer.  And isn't that what you want them to do?	1998-06-30

I think it would have worked better as a series of 3 books or so - I didn't think enough time went into developing the characters, especially Matthiall, because things were moving so fast.  But all in all it was quite enjoyable reading.	1998-06-12

The characters just didn't seem to come to life the way they did in Mists (exception - Viviane), and the story did seem to repeat itself.  Bottom line: read this one before you read Mists, and you'll like it better.  Save the best for last!	1998-06-12

I have no disagreement with this book on the grounds that it doesn't do justice to the original ballad, which, after all, I wasn't especially familiar with until after I read the Dean version.  But am I the only person who finds the characters cold and difficult to really believe in?  I was hoping that this book would sweep me into fantasy right away, and when it didn't, I tried to become engrossed in the lives of these college students in the seventies.  But I just couldn't do it.  They just aren't believable enough to be interesting and aren't fantastic enough to grab your attention until the very end.	1998-05-13

OK, if you are an Arthurian scholar you should skip this - it will annoy you.  But if you're somewhat less erudite and just want to be captured by a stirring tale of the women surrounding the legend, you can do no better than this book.  You will fall in love!	1998-05-13

I'm almost to the finish and am finding it enthralling.  The characters are flawed, yes, but it makes them believable, not plastic.  A very good read.	1998-02-10

Sigh...if only they made a calendar for people like me who like the Disney animated features but not the short cartoons, life would be perfect. :)  Just kidding, but it would be closer.  Still, this is a beautiful calendar, and you can cut the prettiest pictures out after you're done with them and put them up somewhere nice!  ESPECIALLY not to be missed if you're a fan of Sleeping Beauty, but if you're looking for Hercules shots, you'll be puzzled by the complete absence of Megara in this calendar.	1997-12-06

But it's more fluffy than substantial.  If you're looking for a &quot;think&quot; novel, this is not the one.	1997-12-03
US	52812074	RJ15XGZFWJH4Z	0786861584	88545618	The Art of Pocahontas	Books	5	1	4	N	N	Very beautiful!	First of all, I assume that these reviews are supposed to refer to the large hardcover edition, which was published in 1995, and not the smaller 1996 edition.  The large one is gorgeous, allowing a look into the world of how the artists develop a film from start to finish.  Some of the concept art is so beautiful that you wonder why it didn't make it into the film.  My only gripe with this book is that, like Rebello's other books, it deals  almost entirely with the visual aspect of the films and, although it talks about how songs developed the movie (the Colors of the Wind section is especially well done), what about the voices?  In The Art of Animation: From Mickey Mouse to Beauty and the Beast, descriptions and photos are included of the actors who voiced the characters.  While you might say that this sort of thing doesn't belong in an &quot;Art of&quot; book, I think it does, because the actor who voices a character often has a tremendous influence on the visual development of that character.  For example, Belle in Beauty and the Beast would not have had the lock of hair that kept falling into her face - an endearing gesture that helped make her more real to the audience - if Paige O'Hara, her voice, had not had it first.  The Art of Pocahontas would be perfect if it offered similar insights. But it's definitely worth reading or just looking at, to bask in the sheer beauty of the artwork.	1997-11-25
US	52812074	R2G2J0EIPPL6X9	0786862084	16639782	The Art of The Hunchback of Notre Dame	Books	5	9	10	N	N	A must for Disney worshippers	Like Rebello's previous &quot;Art of&quot; books (Lion King and Pocahontas), this one is a joy to look at, but it's missing one thing.  I wish it had more about the characters' voices.  Often the actor or actress who voices a character influences the visual development of that character.  The animator may model the character after the actor, or he or she may take one particular gesture from the actor and incorporate it into the character (like Belle - she kept brushing that lock of hair away from her face because her voice, Paige O'Hara, did the same thing).  So including some information about the voices behind the characters would provide even more insight for those of us clamoring to know about how an animated film is made.  But even with this one flaw, the book is gorgeous, especially the production stills of the interior of Notre Dame.  And the concept art is great - sometimes it's wildly different from what actually shows up on screen, so you get a look at the evolution process.  Oh - don't skip the index.  The illustrations of how animators let off steam are hysterical!  My favorite - &quot;Quasi and Harriet&quot;.  So, if you're a fan of Disney animation, get this!	1997-11-25
US	52812074	RNE6DNSVX0OND	1562828924	699437399	Disney's Aladdin: The Making of an Animated Film	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A good read, but not perfect	I collect the Disney &quot;art of&quot; books, and I think that although this one provides some interesting looks into the world of animation, the Art of the Lion King, Pocahontas, and Hunchback are much more comprehensive and better put together.  I was also puzzled by the refusal of the author to mention Robin Williams' name - he was always referred to as &quot;the actor who portrayed the Genie&quot;.  Did he refuse to give an interview and thus annoy the author?  After all, he did a bit on Linda Larkin, who in my opinion was much less vital to the success of the movie than Williams was.	1997-11-25

I got this as a gift from someone who'd never read it (if he had read it and had given it to me anyway, I would have killed him)...the first clue to how bad it is is in the little tear-out cards in the front that say &quot;Name, weight, height, how we met,etc.&quot; to give out to prospective dates.  Are they serious?  The rest of the book is similarly ridiculous.  It's good for a laugh if nothing else.	1997-11-23
