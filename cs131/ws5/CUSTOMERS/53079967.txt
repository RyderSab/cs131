US	53079967	R1I9I5QURU9NDZ	0226062465	788489815	Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction	Books	4	0	1	N	Y	Two sides explained	Norberto Bobbio wrote this book during the first half of the 90's, while Italy was going through an unprecedented election whose winner was Berlusconi. <br />Back then, and I would say that ten years later it's still the same, the difference between left and right was not very clear for most of the people.  <br />With this in mind, Bobbio starts his analysis by studying the political spectrum implications in society. He points out that the main distinction between left and right are related mainly to the notions of equality and inequality. He also explains why the extreme versions of both are more likely to come together as it happened during World War 2. <br />I think the book is very useful to understand the ideologies behind the political parties. However, it might not be 100% applicable to explain US politics.	2005-09-14

I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in languages.	2005-09-01

A group of boys ends up in a desert island after a plane crash and they have to struggle to survive. The battle of leadership begins shortly and two styles arrise. One is a symbol of order and civilization. The other is the opposite: anarchy and barbarism. Everything happens through the eyes of these boys, whose hope is to rescued. Highly recommendable if you liked Animal Farm for example.	2005-08-22

The 9/11 attacks brought this book to the media which was regarded as a visionary explanation of what happened back then. <br />Samuel Huntington divides the world in many civilizations, that are in tension among them due to many reasons. I think he should have called them simply \\"religions\\" because that is mainly what he uses to identify each of them. Thus, what he calls the \\"Western Civilization\\" is the Christian World, the \\"Sinic Civilization\\" is primarily Confucian, and we must not forget Islam or Muslim. Under those labels, he does a world segmentation with minor attention to the differences within each civilization. That is too much simplification for me. <br />Despite of that, I found his theories very interesting and his model appears to explain many of today's conflicts. It was OK until the final chapter. That's when his quest against multicultural societies begin. He not only thinks that the US should stop its trend towards what he calls a \\"torn\\" country due to immigration (which, by the way, is in relative terms lower that the waves observed at the beginning of the 20th century). He also believes that the threat of violence is directly related to the Muslim civilization, making a clearly intolerant statement. My question to Mr. Hungtigton is: what is the role of poverty and neglect in the clash of Civilizations? Is it really all a consequence of religion? Or should I say, are people so desperate that find in religion an escape from their daily struggle, and sometimes, listening to the prophets of terrorism? I'm not blaming anyone for that. I'm saying that at least, he should have spoken about it.	2005-07-26

This group was formed many centuries ago by men of science who were threatened and punished by the church due to their discoveries, most of them against the catholic paradigm. In this novel, the group was far from being extinct and they return for their final revenge: to use their ultimate weapon to destroy their enemy. <br />The novel is highly entertaining.

That \\"secret\\" is written in 10 ancient rolls who were given to him by another rich merchant before he died. These tips to accumulate wealth are nothing but cheap self-improvement-new-age advice that have nothing to do with business. For example, in the roll marked 1, you can read: \\"Today I will savor the taste of grapes from these vines and verily I will swallow the seed of success buried in each and new life will sprout within me\\". The roll marked 2 starts with this sentence: \\"I will greet this day with love in my heart\\" and number 4 begins with \\"I am nature's greatest miracle\\".<br /><br />This is the kind of insights you may expect from any book but a one called \\"The greatest salesman in the world\\". And it is so short: only 111 pages of really big print.<br /><br />If you want to read these kind of books, but written by good authors, please refer to Paulo Coelho.	2005-06-05

It is written as a novel, in plain language, and it gives you a good starting point for further reading.  <br />The story itself is weak: a young girl starts receiving letters from an unknown philosopher who starts to teach her the most important ideas of the main thinkers. But don't let this fact discourage you as the author tries hard not to send you to sleep and, in my opinion, he succeeds. Be also aware that philosophy keeps your brain pretty busy so it's a good point that the story doesn't require an \\"intellectual effort\\" to be understood. <br />Being a young adult myself, I recommend it for all ages, although some higher instruction is welcome in order to better grasp the concepts. <br />	2004-10-26

He points out that there is a lot of dead capital in these countries that could be easily used to produce wealth. To achieve that, he says, property must be registred and legalized in order to allow capital to flow. The idea is at first sight interesting, but De Soto couldn't prove his theory in his book. He repeats the same ideas several times throughout the chapters as trying to convince himself of his beliefs. He tries to minimize the role of culture, for example, which undoubtedly plays a key factor in a society's progress, and especially in Latin America where we inherited the culture of the Spaniards who only wanted to get rich without working. From my point of view, the extra legal sector is not the cause of underdevelopment, but rather a consequence of it. As a country's economy grows, so does the need for property rights to be assured. You can't start by the end of the process, or De Soto really thinks that by giving each Peruvian (or any other citizen of Latin America) a legal title for his property he will turn Peru into an economic success? But that is not all, he also blames lawyers for the economic failure of countries!! My final words are: don't buy this book. If you read the beginning of my review then you got De Soto's theory, further reading, for me, is not necessary.	2001-08-25
