Although I love a chilling psychological mystery (Ruth Rendell rules), sometimes nothing hits the spot like a good old-fashioned British cozy with characters suitable for a game of \\"Clue\\" and a victim who's usually unbereavble by all -including the reader. I picked up this book because a blurb said the author was a master of the genre. What I found was a crime that simply cannot make the transition to \\"entertainment\\" in my mind(child abduction/pronography/molestation/murder)along with uniformly cold, unlikeable characters and a cynical attitude that must have Agatha Christie twirling in her grave. <br />Not a pleasant read.	2004-08-28

Once again Cornwell brings us a slew of over-the-top characters, all of whom are prickly, selfish, amoral, irritating, paranoid, depressing, self-pitying and hateful to those closest to them - and that's just the good guys! It almost seems the author's running some kind of experiment. \\"How long will it take readers to figure out I'm putting them on?\\" Will anyone notice that the emperor is buck-naked?  <br />A wolf-man, his gorgeous twin, scions of a family that tries to (dare I say it?) rule the world, their lawyer who just happens to be the son of the determinedly obnoxious policeman who worships the brilliant but always persecuted Scarpetta who worships Superniece and on and on it goes. None of the relationships bear the slightest resemblance to any between real people or between any fictional characters you'd actually want to know.<br />The whole thing reminded me of some gory comic book aimed at the lowest common denominator lurking in pre-teen boys. Or a child who's story gets more and more fantastic as he warms to the subject until he's exhausted the wildest limits of his imagination and winds down to the anti-climatic \\"and then the good guys killed the bad guys and that's the end.\\" <br />Would that it were so, but Wolfie's still out there (dang, it's easy to get out of prison these days) and he'll probably meet up with Frankenstein in the next book. I just hope one of them scares me away from the library before I fall for the \\"surely, the next one will be better\\" thing again.	2004-04-01

She's written a lot of books I admired, a few that seemed lacking, and at least one that struck me as a total disaster (see &quot;Bite the Moon&quot;), but here she dispels all fears that her skills as a writer have atrophied. <br />There is scarcely a paragraph in this book that doesn't contain a gem of humor, poignancy, or simply character observation worth savoring. It's especially interesting that the theme is similar to the one in the much maligned effort mentioned above - a lonely and resourceful kid tackling some very adult problems. But here there's something very genuine about the emotions. The characters are wonderfully realized and their interaction is often hilarious. It's a coming-of-age story as well as a mystery, evocative and lyrical and clearly the work of a master.	2001-12-05

With typical restraint the rest of the media, not to mention law enforcement, have chosen to ignore the red flags waving all over this potential scoop, so she's pretty much on her own. <br />Along the way she meets several highly suspicious people in whom she instantly places all her considerable trust. (It's hard to imagine this innocent navigating the local mall, much less a war zone in Sarajevo.) In her favor she has really nice bosses at the network who don't mind if she blows off her duties as a news anchor to stumble around the world interviewing highly placed officials, all of whom seem eager to answer her na√Øve queries. (The exotic locales are established by a few lines of travel-guide dialogue in genuine foreign languages.)<br />Her boyfriend (we know they're in love cause they call each other &quot;darling&quot;) is supposed to be covering sports on the same TV show, but he's too busy helping his Supermodel ex-wife race through history's fastest cancer treatment. There must be a lot of dead air on that newscast. <br />Our heroine has also &quot;rescued&quot; a one-armed war orphan upon whom she bestows much benign neglect. (Can't help thinking this kid would have been better off on his own. And has anybody asked where he was the night the fugitive's wife got killed?) Anyhow, it turns out intelligent people worldwide have all been fooled into thinking that the personification of Satan was a saint, and it's up to our heroine to set them straight and save the world. <br />Sheldon keeps the plot twists coming and the pages turning into a compulsive one-night read, even if I was giggling all the way.	2001-12-05

For sheer chaotic bloodletting nothing beats the reality of the French Revolution, and Perry does a good job of conveying the paranoia of the times in a few short pages. The story relies on the main character's leap to a conclusion, a life-and-death decision based on nothing more than a few words of gossip. This is not the first time Perry has resorted to such a flimsy plot device, but it's easier to swallow when it's not the foundation for an entire novel. Here, the action barely begins before we cut to the chase, and with danger closing in on all sides, who's got time to quibble?	2001-11-19

She couldn't simply ignore it, as she's always most meticulous in describing the events and attitudes that shaped the times. On the other hand, she couldn't very well have one of her detectives collaring the perpetrator when we all know his identity is still up for grabs.<BR> <BR>In &quot;The Whitechapel Conspiracy&quot; she solves the problem neatly by involving Pitt in a related case. This allows her to use the climate of fear, as well as some of the more fanciful theories, surrounding the Ripper and still give Pitt and company an interesting case to solve. One of her best in recent years.	2001-11-19

Maybe if I'd read the earlier entries in the series I'd have felt some affection for the main couple, but none developed during &quot;Suspicion of Deceit.&quot; They, along with a large cast of unappealing characters, never tell the same story twice, so it's hard to know where the truth lies - or to care.

Not that there weren't the same improbabilities and grating personalities as before. Maybe I've just stopped expecting logical plotting and likeable characters.  <br />While a lot of readers didn't care for the probing into Scarpetta's psyche, I've always enjoyed that sort of thing, and frankly, it was refreshing to seek some excuse for her self-obsessed, paranoid attitude. Never mind that everyone IS actually after her. How did a woman who's so universally distrusted keep her job this long?<br />It also probably helped my enjoyment that Superniece made only limited appearances, flying in for the rescue, of course, but pulling off her usual stunning accomplishment per book (this time becoming a millionaire) off stage. <br />What I liked was the forensic clues, some sharp writing, the plot twists and finally finding out things we should have learned in the last book. Since Cornwell's obviously into bringing back characters from the past, my vote goes to Mr. Peanut. As one of the few sympathetic players in the story, I'd like to see a sequel in which she returns to nip at the ankles of Scarpetta and her whining posse and then finds a loving home with some well-adjusted person who would obviously have to be created by another author.	2001-10-30

But I for one find it harder to enjoy the guilty pleasures of the genre when the targets are by their nature totally helpless. It's not fun; it's not sporting.

No one seems more surprised than Catherine Saylor, childless career-woman that she is, when her gut reactions to her niece's wild behavior result in far more effective parenting than the girl gets from her own mother.<br />The characters, even while most are involved in the same line of work, are carefully delineated. There's enough information about genetic research to indicate Grant's really done her homework, enough to help readers understand the issues behind the crimes without drifting off.

While her exploration of the psychological and spiritual issues central to human behavior is skillful and thought provoking as usual, &quot;The High Flyer&quot; left me with a feeling of distaste. Maybe it was the lily-gilding of her central malevolent figure. I couldn't help thinking the insights into the nature of evil would have seemed more relevant had he not been portrayed in almost cartoonish proportions. Pick a sin, any sin, and he's committed it. Most ethical battles are fought in a gray area without the benefit of such a clearly delineated enemy.<br />Or maybe it was the grating repetition of cloying phrases like nutterguff, fruity-loops, tiger-thumper, fluffette, etc.<br />Most likely, it was the reduction of the strong female character to a quivering mass of uncertainty, an empty vessel needing to be filled with the beliefs of others - primarily men of varying degrees of sexual attractiveness - in order to find peace. Forcing her heroine to examine and reorder her priorities is one thing, but Howatch seems to condemn her basic strength and independence as well, and - for me - that just didn't fly.	2001-09-22

Any of these ingredients might be a good core for a thriller, but they don't come together in any meaningful way. Throw in a well-adjusted child turned instantly neurotic, a maladjusted dad, whose fragile psyche could never have survived medical school, and an ineffectual mother and you've got motives as murky as the fog that heralds the ghost's arrival. The plot revolves around &quot;little children&quot; who - at 12 - inexplicably speak and act like eight-year-olds. There isn't enough reality here to make the supernatural aspects effective.	2001-09-15

On the other hand, if you like English village mysteries - with the implied promise that the villain can be found among the residents described and won't turn out to be a passing serial killer - you'll appreciate this story. Granger gives us plenty of players with motives and doesn't make it easy to spot the crucial one.  Unfortunately, her leading characters have come to an &quot;awkward&quot; point in their relationship and aren't a lot of fun to be with.

The central characters in &quot;Grasshopper&quot; might appear to be slackers, aimless and uninteresting, but under her penetrating gaze they reveal virtues and fatal flaws of almost Shakespearean proportions. <br />Despite widely differing backgrounds and personalities, several young people have united in their determination to make their own rules. One way they rise above conventional society - literally - is by running around on rooftops (an activity that while no doubt exhilarating for the participants is not all that engaging for readers.) Their bids for freedom meet with varying success, for as Vine always shows us, the real world has a way of insinuating itself and its rules into even the most exclusive social circles. And then there are those pesky hang-ups that tend to stay with us wherever we go.<br />It's impossible to guess how Vine's novels are going to end despite her frequent use of foreshadowing. Sometimes it's just a hint; sometimes it's a startling fact about the future or the yet undiscovered past. Far from spoiling the suspense, these tidbits tend to pique the reader's interest. &quot;Now, how does that person wind up doing that?&quot; When it comes to absorbing characters and psychological suspense, nobody does it better.	2001-08-31

That youthful sense of invulnerability helps coax us out of our cribs and into battle with the real world. But when a life-altering tragedy does occur, we're pushed into a different realm of awareness. All bets are off and anything can happen. Dave Eggers captures the landscape of that realm perfectly.<br />Since something unthinkable has taken place, his most horrifying fantasies seem not only possible but probable. He'll be murdered, his little brother kidnapped and molested. One minute he feels doomed; the next he's grasping at life with manic determination. Is the loss of his parents a tragedy, a cosmic joke or just something that happened? Eggers hurtles through the confusion like a runaway train by turns romanticizing his situation and regarding it with a detached irony more befitting his Gen-X sensibilities.<br />It's sad that someone so young has this kind of story to tell, but lucky for us that he's articulate enough to express so much sorrow, humor and truth.	2001-08-31

Their different interpretations of situations and even words are depicted with compassion and a great deal of humor as they try to find common ground. Even when they clash, we can understand where each is coming from.<br />As if navigating the waters of racial sensitivity weren't daunting enough, the characters are also faced with tough choices about career, dating, family, office politics and other ethical dilemmas that often seem to demand conflicting solutions. There are lots of other well-drawn characters, some with good intentions, some with bad and some caught up in a confusion of both.

Some parts were repetitive, as if the author just needed to fill a few more pages, and the nearly unanimous placing of blame by the townspeople was a little hard to swallow, but it served to isolate the protagonist in his desperation. Such mechanisms seem forgivable when the purpose is to give readers goosebumps. If the characters were to stay away from forbidden rooms, refuse to follow apparitions in the night or just get the hell out of the creepy house it would be more logical, but a lot less fun. Overall, the author played fair and kept me guessing. I'll try him again soon.	2001-08-21

I enjoyed it and wasn't so disappointed that I don't look forward to his next one. Still, I was a little perplexed by the glowing reviews that introduce the book, since it's not nearly as good as his others.<br />As many reviewers have pointed out, the real villain is pretty apparent from the get-go. Given two blatantly obvious suspects and a writer who knows his way around a twist and turn, what reader of thrillers isn't going to pick out the culprit early on? The choice seems particularly arbitrary as the extreme nature of the crimes makes it hard to believe that no one saw through the good-guy image over such a long period of time. On the other hand, his coworkers are such an unsavory lot that he may have blended in. That hospital should seriously consider replacing its Human Resources personnel.	2001-08-21

His tough-guy protagonist can hold his own with the best of them, doggedly pursuing his brand of maverick justice, meeting and beating the low-lifes on their own level. At the same time he's a smart man whose passion for book collecting provides lots of insights bound to intrigue the avid reader. <br />I recently read Julie Kaewert's &quot;Un&quot; series, which also involves the acquisition of rare books but with an emphasis on secret societies and arcane messages that give it an &quot;Indiana Jonesish&quot; quality. Dunning's tidbits about what makes a book valuable are more accessible and interesting, and his hero's brushes with violence arise logically from who he is. Kaewert's Alex Plumtree is beaten, stabbed, shot and otherwise assualted with a regularity that seems a tad excessive in the publishing industry. Besides, you've got to love a mystery that reveals one of its secrets in the very last line of the book.	2001-08-21

Her writing falls into the category of  \\"good things I can't get enough of,\\" and very little of it turned out to be extraneous. <br />The story requires a gradual unfolding of the characters' histories in order to understand their perceptions and motivations. Ultimately, the most bizarre behavior makes perfect sense in the context of each character's limitations. And just when you think one of them has succeeded in transcending those limitations there's an ironic - and inevitable - twist.<br />George's ongoing characters take a backseat here, and that seems like a wise decision. Their presence gives us a touchstone in a story of people trying to come to terms with the past. We already know them as the good guys, yet their shared history haunts the present with enough angst to fuel a melodrama. Is it any wonder then that the less stable characters in the book have trouble escaping the events that shaped them? Altogether a satisfying foray into the psychological mystery genre.	2001-08-21

Without the trappings that usually define them, they're compelled to get down to basics and discover important things about themselves.<br />While some of Lurie's earlier books are richer, the broad strokes seem appropriate here. A world pared down to sea and sand, where everyone's at the end of the line, is drawn with an economy worthy of that other Key West writer. If only Papa had been this funny.	2001-07-20

What did bowl me over was his ability to perceive the world through the eyes of a female growing up in the last half of the 20th century. Having weathered the same treacherous journey, I can vouch for his accuracy in evoking each era, particularly the 50s and 60s - not just with references to popular culture (music, TV shows, etc.) but with small details about everyday life and the attitudes of the times. <br />Delores may be unique and larger-than-life, but there's something of her in anyone who's ever felt unsure of themselves or frustrated with the refusal of loved ones to fill the idealized roles we've written for them. She doesn't just resist the notion that life isn't fair; she wrestles with it - almost to the death.  Ultimately, hers is a story of looking for love in all the wrong places, of learning to recognize it in its many unlikely guises and to thrive on its imperfect gifts. <br />A depressing story? Actually, it's wickedly funny. And I was glad the heroine didn't turn out to be a significant artist  or world-renowned humanitarian. She could, but it would be beside the point.  Delores isn't an ugly duckling on her way to swanhood; she's a woman with more defects than virtues and more bad breaks than lucky one who learns to appreciate people for who they are - including herself - and to open up to the delightful surprises that every life has in store.  She's Wally Lamb's assurance that there's hope for us all.	2001-07-10

First, it's guaranteed that I'll like the writing and the central characters, because I always have. But sometimes Hill throws in a bonus - an element you wouldn't expect to find that weaves through the main plot with illuminating results. This time it's shades of Homer.  (Not Simpson - the other guy, although the prospect of Andy hoisting a few Duffs with Bart's dad has definite appeal.) The story begins with glimpses into several unidentified characters' minds. Who are these people? What are they going on about? It's confusing but not frustrating because we know Hill will ultimately lock all the puzzle pieces into place and show us the big picture. This time it's downright epic with the raging sea playing one of its most pivotal roles since the Odyssey, and the women finding resources  that would have made Aeschylus proud. Not that Dalziel and Pascal are ever far away. When they're not on stage as themselves, they're there in the characters of Odysseus and Aeneas, as written by Ellie with perception, humor and surprising (in one case) affection. Hill can get inside the minds of not only his heroes - but women, children, Greeks, cats, killers, and thankfully readers.	2001-06-25
US	51298501	RTVR8ICQPDR5A	0451409361	202394023	The Lamorna Wink	Books	4	5	7	N	N	Getting there is ALL the fun	&quot;The Lamorna Wink\\" is proof that the journey can outshine the destination. I thoroughly enjoyed this book while I was reading it - interesting cast of characters, humor, classic Cornwall cliff-top setting, several intriguing mysteries. One of the author's attempts to distract the reader from the truth was particularly clever and satisfying. I couldn't wait to pick it up again. So it came as a surprise when, having finished the novel, I felt bleak, disgruntled and reluctant to recommend it to anyone else. Never mind that there were loopholes in plot and motivation big enough to accommodate your average lorry. No, I think the operative word for the book's ultimate negative impact is \\"gratuitous.\\" Other readers have already pointed to the focus on the children's suffering (now that's entertainment!) which seems out of place given the tone of the book. Then one of the main mysteries is resolved only to take a tragic turn for no discernible reason other than to provide a downer of an ending. This isn't a police procedural, after all, or the evening news. It's a British whodunit featuring eccentric characters and an eerie house on a windswept sea. I'm still glad I read it; I'm just sorry I read it all.	2001-06-25

There are too many intriguing questions waiting to be answered. Yes, there are some potentially implausible turns and amnesia is always a tough sell, but those factors only demonstrate what a terrific story-teller Mercer is. I raced merrily through the pages (with my suspended disbelief stumbling along behind), eager to find out what was really going on. A fun read.	2000-10-25

Even her protagonists are irrasible and paranoid to the point that they can't get along with each other for more than five minutes without blowing up, storming out or otherwise behaving like emotionally stunted two-year-olds. It's unusual to enjoy a mystery and its solution without experiencing the slightest affinity for the people involved, but that's the way I feel reading Cornwell's books. Given the choice of hanging out with the good doctor, Superniece, and their friends or the unfortunate victims in the morgue, I'd choose the latter; at least they know how to stay calm and cool under pressure.	2000-09-27

Amnesia qualifies for this category, along with the notion of two young orphaned girls hitting the road on an heroic odyssey. Instead of seeking help, the assault victim allows herself to be picked up again - by the same attacker! She doesn't recognize him, but that's okay cause he pretends not to recognize her either and simply gives her a ride. How many kids have both a wild animal as a pet and a scientific genius for a sidekick? Why river rafting, murder, pornography? While the mistreatment of animals is a worthwhile subject, it's oddly placed in this hodgepodge. I got the feeling the author had a file full of ideas that she decided to get rid of in one fell swoop. The result is an unnecessarily hard-to-swallow mishmash that does justice neither to Grimes' abilities as a writer nor to the issue of animal abuse. I've enjoyed her books in the past, but I'm not getting near the next one without a whip and a chair.	2000-09-27

Still, I wish Perry would realize that  it's also difficult for loyal fans to plow through yet another rehashing of  nurses' plight in the Crimea and 19th-century England. I find myself  skimming an author whose every word I used to savor. Also detracting from  this book was the way characters - even whole courtrooms - kept jumping to  ridiculous conclusions with scant provocation. Despite these complaints, I  still enjoy the characters and the world that Perry has so carefully  created. She's a skilled enough writer that it's fun watching how she gets  from A to Z even when it's pretty obvious what Z's going to be.	2000-02-23

How much can you expect from a story built around a famous event when neither the writer nor the editors have bothered to learn when it happened? On the off chance that the author was playing with time for some surreal purpose yet to be revealed I  kept reading. No surrealism here - just a straightforward mystery yarn,  notable for its humor, interesting characters and very successful evocation  of the &quot;late fifties.&quot; I'm glad I read it, and that's disturbing  because sloppy editing almost scared me away. Dare we hope for a sequel -  &quot;The Day Camelot Died, Nov. 22, 1962&quot;?	2000-01-26

In &quot;Pictures of Perfection&quot; Reginald Hill gives us both the terrific Daziel/Pascoe mystery we've come to expect and something totally unexpected as well. <br />The village of Enscombe has changed only  superficially since the days of Jane Austen whose words just happen to  introduce each chapter. One of the residents, Caddy Scudamore, is a  talented artist given to painting over much of her crowded canvases. This  is done, we are told, not so much to obliterate as to &quot;relegate it to  a kind of misty otherworld where it still continued to exert its  existence.&quot; <br />Hill, too, offers us one thing - a contemporary mystery  - beneath which lie all the sense and sensibilities of Austen. Social  dynamics and entailments. Misunderstandings and love matches (at least one  of which in its `90s incarnation might take even Jane by surprise!) But  most of all, insight and humor and a joyous way with words that can make a  reader laugh out loud. Austen could do it and so can Reginald Hill. <br />He  leads us into the story through a scenario that we find all too easy to  accept and ushers us out again with a reminder that appearances can be  deceiving. Jane would have agreed.	1999-08-25
