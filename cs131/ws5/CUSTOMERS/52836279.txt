I tore through the book and recommend it highly for anyone who loves the game and wants to swim in the lore and detail of it.  It's a great job of reporting and a wonderful appreciation of how the game should be approached.  I could nitpick about some of the moments that annoyed me, but they are miniscule, a pop fly in a 10-9 slugfest.  I loved this book.	2005-06-20

This is taut, believable urban crime drama from someone batting .1000 right out of the box on his first two novels.  It's not plot-crazed Grisham.  It's a story and characters to think about and a protagonist you can actually buy.  I loved it, just as I loved Hollowpoint, his first.  The second is more enjoyable if you read HP and got the setup but Semiautomatic also stands on its own as a first-rate urban crime novel.  Very good stuff.Can't waint for the next one.	2004-06-30

God, I'm glad she did.  It's a wonderful story, well written, funny, touching, from the heart.  I haven't been this moved by a novel since &quot;The Corrections.&quot;  Some critics said some of the characters were cliche or stereotypes, but they missed the point.  The book rings true and touches your heart.  Can you ask for anything more? Buy it, read it, commend it to your friends.  They'll be glad you did.	2004-04-29

The story is believable and accurate in tone and detail.  The characters seem real and the plot is not some far-fetched Grisham-like fantasy that could never happen in a million years.

US	52836279	R19CC80IKQ9ULZ	0316154601	239093791	Lost Light	Books	5	2	2	N	N	nobody does this better	The brooding, dark, [angry] character of Harry Bosch is so fully developed and flshed-out that after finishng one of Connelly's books you find yourself wondering what's Harry up to now.  What's he doing today?  The plots are tightly drawn and don't suffer from what so many books in this genre are afflicted with: grandiosity that renders them unbelievable.  You can't stop reading, but not because Connelly writes page turners in the traditional sense of the word.  You want to see how Harry, with his self-destructive tendencies and high sense of integity, is going to get out of his latest mess.  These books are so enjoyable one gets the idea Connelly doesn't labor over them too much but he must.  Writing this good doesn't come easy.  It's like watching Hank Aaron in his prime.  He never seemed to be working all that hard.  He just hit more than 750 home runs.  I can't wait for another Bosch bomb.	2003-04-24

If you think you're getting the real story by watching the media play the brilliantly manipulative and cynical Pentagon game of \\"embedded with the troops\\" -- we'll show them everything, that way they'll see nothing -- you have to read this book. It's painful, disturbing, profane, twisted, ugly, offensive, insulting, macabre, gruesome, chauvunistic, jingoistic, obnoxious and utterly brilliant.  Swofford was a marine sniper in the first gulf war and he writes with the laser accuracy of the weapons he was trained on.  this is war reporting from the hearts and minds of the young men sent across the world to fight -- for what?  It's hard to say for sure but as we learn from this instant masterpiece of war reporting, the jarhead cares nothing about politics, oil or united nations posturing.  he spends every second in the desert fighting, scheming and praying to stay alive and keep his buddies alive, too -- even the ones he can't stand.  Our president -- make that your president, not mine -- knows nothing about war or the men doing his bidding.  He's the first person who should read this book. He can read, can't he?  All the rest of us should follow.  Anthony Swofford has done his nation much more genuine good than he did by serving in Gulf War I.  He deserves every bit of success and good fortune that comes his way.  He has a great story to tell and he writes like his heart is plugged into an amplifier.  A thrilling, fantastic and important piece of work. Thank you, Jarhead Swofford. I can't get this book out of my mind.  It will haunt you as you watch the absurd television coverage brought to you by the cheerleaders at the networks.  I'm especially proud to know Swofford grew up where I now live and took a writing class at the junior college up the street from me.	2003-03-28

I worked for a newspaper in Little Rock, Arkansas a number of years back and never fully believed the myth of a new South.  Racism and hate are alive and well in places like Jaspar, just as they are alive and well in places all over this country.  By going in directions that took her off the well-marked path of the pack of reporters who descended on the town after Mr. Byrd was dragged to death by the back of a pickup truck, the author succeeds in getting at the essence of a small Southern town that remains a place of venom and poison for people of color or different sexual orientation -- even if the affront to liberty and choice are not acted out on a daily basis.  She helps expose one of the great myths in America: that somehow racism and hatred are less of a problem today because laws have been passed and we like to think of ourselves as more tolerant and open than the generations that came before us.  This is an important book, well researched and written and one that deserves a wide audience.	2003-03-12

Erik Larson has a knack for coming up with great ideas and then executing them masterfully.  I'm not sure this top's Isaac's Storm, his last gem, for sheer interest, but it comes awfully close.  The 1893 World's Fair was one of the seminal events ever held in this country and to have a mass murderer like the mad Mr. Holmes running around its edges provides -- in the hands of a master like Larson -- page-turning suspense and interest.  The men who staged the fair are important historical figures most Americans never heard of and Larson writes about them with great skill and appreciation.  I loved this book and can't wait for Larson's next effort.	2003-03-01

I can't recall being this absorbed in a novel in ages.  The characters are so wonderful and wondferfully drawn that you can't stand to be away from them for too long.  Look no farther for the Great American Novel.  This is it.  Most other books suffer woefully by comparison.  This will make you want to saddle up and ride the range for sure, even as it scares the living daylights out of you.  Fantastic epic by a brilliant writer and storyteller.

This is as much of an appreciation of the former Dodger great as it is revealing biography, but it's a wonderful book that I recommend highly.  There is a great deal of insight into Koufax and what made him such a pitching marvel. Without saying so directy, we see how even Dodger management didn't know what to make of his being Jewish and I conclude from reading this book that Walt Alston and the Dodgers didn't deserve Koufax. ....  Sandy was a tough, competitive as hell pitching God who simply was a nice guy and valued his privacy and ordinariness as much as his career, if not more. He really was and is a class guy who stands out among our star ball players almost as much for that characteristic -- and I say almost -- a he did for his awesome abilities.  Organizing the book around his perfect game aganst the Cubs was a masterstroke and if you're a baseball fan and would like to read about an athlete who was also a truly good guy, you'll love this book.  The writer did an excellent job with a very difficult subject.  Along with Hank Greenberg, Sandy is the Jewish Jackie Robinson and you'll enjoy reading this as much for social commentary as you will for the baseball it captures.	2002-11-04

This is a riveting piece of narrative non-fiction, one of the truly appalling miscarriages of justice in modern times excellently told by a master of true crime writing.  geronimo pratt was framed by the fbi, LA police and LA district attorney's office for a murder he wouldn't -- and didn't -- commit.  \\"Last Man Standing\\" doesn't just capture the case, it brings the reader inside the maddeningly constructed cover-up and heroic attempts to finally achieve justice. You know how it ends but still can't put it down and don't want it to end.  what higher compliment can be said of a piece of writing?  it's a masterpiece.	2002-05-25

It is impossible to put down wheile you're reading it and just as hard to let go of once you've finished.  It is an insult to call this a true-crime book, despite the fact its central story is about a man who snaps and murders his wife and three children.  Like real life, this is about so much more: expectations not reached, pain, sacrifice, love, fear, redemption, the limits of forgiveness and how none of us are the sum of any one thing we have done, no matter how noble or horrific.  Julie Salamon is a wonderful writer and storyteller and while the utter darkness of the book's cetral story will no doubt scare away many potential readers, this is one I would heartily recommend to anyone who is brave enough to tackle it.  The rewards are many, about as much as one can possibly expect from a riveting piece of non-fiction masterfully told.	2001-04-27

US	52836279	R2ES20RAVRP4PS	0316834033	730331750	American Pharaoh: Mayor Richard J. Daley - His Battle for Chicago and the Nation	Books	5	2	3	N	N	as big and controversial as the man it portrays	I grew up in Chicago during the Daley years and he was the man we all loved to hate.  He could be brutal, scheming, bigoted, small-minded and about as inarticulate as a 4th grader, but, man, was he ever in charge.  He  was one of the strongest and in many ways most effective mayors in American  history.  Had he been alive and serving today, after the successes of the  civil rights and women's movements, Daley would undoubtedly have been a  different man.  But he was a product of his tumultuous and explosive times,  and he did better at managing Chicago and its various constituencies than  any 10 politicians of the time could have imagined.  This book, which  views the Daley life and career through the prism of the nascent civil  rights era and Chicago's historic patterns of machine rule and segregation  so well planned and thought out that its remnants remain incredibly strong  today, does a masterful job of bringing Daley the man and politician to  life.  Perhaps it is heavy on detail for someone who didn't live in  Chicago, but it is political biography at its best.  It is a welcome and  long overdue companion piece to Mike Royko's &quot;Boss,&quot; which  remains must reading more than 25 years after it was published. You have to  read it just to learn how one man was able to be mayor for as long as he  was and chairman of the Democratic party, a position that allowed him to  virtually single-handedly determine every Democratic candidate for office  in Chicago and the Northern part of the state, including governor.  Imagine  someone having that kind of power, with his vast patronage powers, today.  Of course, it is impossible, so read American Pharoah and step back in  time.  This is an utterly fascinating book.  I couldn't put it down and  how can one ask anything more from a 550-page biography of a mayor?  Great  book!	2000-07-24

This is not quite as impressive as &quot;American Pastoral,&quot; the first work in this Roth trilogy that  to my mind is one of the truly great novels I have ever read, but it's  powerful nonetheless.  There are so many secrets and contradictions built  upon one another that at the end you're left to wonder whether all the  deceit was necessary.  By the characters, not the author.  And in this era  of self-righteousness, where everyone seems to know just exactly how  everyone else should live his or her life,  Roth constructs a powerful and  furiously angry polemic that illustrates the enormous cost of all this  piousness and hypocrisy.  Read it and weep.  And marvel at his insight and  extraordinary command of the language.  I only hope he can continue to  produce such art for many more years.	2000-07-03

It is as much about the hubris of the age, a hubris we still cling to far more than we should, as it is about the devastating storm and how a city almost was  washed away by it.  Larson is a wonderful writer who is willing to take  risks.  Some reviewers have said there is stoo much speculation in the book  but I disagree.  Larson was diligent and smart enough to choose a story  that was amazingly well documented through journals, memoirs, news  accounts, federal weather service records, etc.  And he treats the story as  a skilled novelist would.  The result is a true page turner in which the  reader continues to be amazed at the sheer magnitude and destruction of the  storm and the human ignorance and arrogance that made the people who were  hit by it so vulnerable.  This is a book that is hard to get out of your  mind after you've finished it.	2000-04-15

I loved this book, but as  in other of his novels he once again demonstrates a willingness to take a  highly appealing story and set of characters and have them engage in all  sorts of bizarre plot twists to pull it all together.  I almost expect him  to eventually write: &quot;And then a spaceship came down from Mars and  killed everyone.  The End.&quot;  It must be hard to outdo your own  success.  Like Carl Hiassen, who seems to keep writing the same book,  Connelly has trouble coming up with solid plot lines.  The stories are  absorbing and engaging until you can almost hear him say, &quot;Oh My God,  I've got to end this and tie it all together.&quot;  As a reader, you feel  offended.  You've been taken for a ride, but with Connelly, at least the  ride is a lot of fun until the horse throws you off at the end and you feel  as if you've been had again.	2000-03-30
US	52836279	R35KUV7LAYZM78	0679455884	90097754	Home Town	Books	5	33	34	N	N	another kidder gem	Tracy Kidder is the best non-fiction writer in America since John McPhee went off the deep end and became fixated on rocks.  Kidder takes seemingly small subjects, in this case a nice little town in Massachusetts that works  pretty well for most of the people who live there, and manages to tell us a  great deal about a great many things: cops, friends, yearning for family,  homelessness, a single woman's dreams and even obsessive-compulsive  disorder.  The writing seems effortless but only because the book is so  well crafted.  This is one of those books where you feel you have more life  inside you simply for having read it.  He manages to bring real people to  life in a way that makes us truly care about what happens to them.  A less  talented writer might tell his or her publisher I want to spend a year  watching what happens in a small town and the publisher might say forget  about it.  In Kidder's hands it works beautifully, as we've come to expect.  I loved this book.	2000-02-29

There is so much here.  Any book by one of the Cheevers merits a look and this is one I have waited for  for a long time.  It could have been much longer but Susan Cheever cuts out  all the extraneous matter and gets to the core of her struggle with  alcohol.  We all struggle with something and reading such an honest account  not only entertains and informs, it helps to lighten our own load and put  it in some clearer perspective.  If I had any complaints about the book,  she drops a few too many names for my taste.  We know the author knows and  is friends with a lot of famous people.  To be reminded as often as we are  slows us down and is a tad annoying.  But just when you think there is no  way to turn an old subject into something fresh and alive, pick up this  book and be surprised.	1999-01-04

Slater did write a great book, her first one, &quot;Welcome to My  Country,&quot; and this follow-up seems a calculated attempt to capitalize  on the first bit of acclaim she won with something sexy like Prozac.

This is a wonderful book, painful and redemptive at the same time, plus  interesting as hell.  If you thought of James Dickey only as the author of  Deliverance, we are made aware here of what a remarkable poet he was and  how pathetically ill-equipped he was for fame, marriage or fatherhood.  It's far more than just another story of wretched excess, though.  Christopher Dickey writes extremely well and honestly about his father and  his feelings for him, and at the end you kind of like the old man, which  sure seemed impossible for much of the book.  But how many of us, if we had  his brilliance or prestige that he gained from it, would have been any  better at resisting all the trappings that come along?  I'm still thinking  about this book long after I finished and the end, where James Dickey is  quoted at length on what it means to be a poet, is spellbinding and  inspirational, worth the price of the book and the time it took to get to  the end.	1998-10-22

I have read literally dozens of memoirs the past few years and this book is as good as any of them.  In addition to being so well written, its unflinching honesty and pain make it impossible to put out of your thoughts long after you've finished.  The author doesn't try to excuse or exaggerate her own shortcomings and weakness and the picture she paints of her lawyer lover is so slimy and ugly the only question one asks is how possibly could she have fallen for him.  of course, we know the answer: money, insecurity, fame, romance, etc.  Growing up in a Jewish family with all the attendant confused feelings about God, observance and the family feuds that seem to accompany it all, I could easily relate to what Shapiro experienced with her family.  This is not a prurient or self-pitying book and it's almost hard to pinpoint its attraction other than to settle on its honesty, integrity and the drama attached to a life when one finally matures and realizes there are more pre! ssing reasons to live than simply in pursuit of one's own pleasure and respite from pain.  People depend on us, sometimes too much, and the sacrifices we make for family can be suffocating.  As the author points out, what kind of person would we be if we didn't at least try to live up to some of the expectations.  I loved this book.	1998-07-21

This is the type of book you hate to leave home for work because it means you have to stop reading for a few hours.  Price writes with such clarity and truth you expect to run into the characters on the street.  You kind of know the story since it's a fictionalization of the Susan Smith story -- the crazy woman who drowned her two kids because she was in love with some jerk and then claimed a black man hijacked her car and the kids -- but there is still plenty of suspense and intrigue.  I have two nits to pick with the author: some of the characters become so articulate and wise when they have their epiphanies, especially the mom, that it's a little hard to swallow.  And the last 100 pages feels like a bit of a burden after the climactic event and we see the community deal with what has happened.  But this is a great book, a masterpiece I would say, of reality based fiction.  You will not be able to put it town.	1998-07-05

Irving can be annoying and ponderous -- thank God no bears in this one -- but the story is a good one and we care about its characters.  I'm not a prude but the preoccupation with sex and juvenile fascination with women gets a little old and you wonder if it's needed or just Irving's way of staving off his own fears of getting old.  You feel a little stupid and annoyed at the end for caring so much about these people but you do care.  Clearly his best and most readable book since Garp.	1998-06-23

Bragg is a wonderful writer and the honesty and emotion be brings to this story are extremely touching.  Instead of being someone who is ashamed of where he came from, it's clear his background is what has made him so empathic and human.  It was hard, but you know he feels lucky to have been born into the circumstances he was born into.  You fall in love with his mother from the moment you meet her and can't help but feel her pride and inner strength.  There are great stories about working at various newspapers and covering the big news of the day but the real appeal here is the little stuff, the stories no one sees or hears that take place in houses all over this country.  This is great literature and to the one review I read that said Bragg was a little self-centered, get a clue.  It's a memoir.  One of the best, a book that will hold up a long time.	1997-12-31

In the end, I think it's about God and how God acts and reaches us through other people.  In teaching a lesson, the teacher in the book becomes the student and learns that we all need one another, that is why we are here on this earth and only in treating one another with dignity and love can we ever hope to find our own salvation.  I started out thinking the book was a bit of a soap opera, overly simplistic and pat in structure and tone.  But it's designed to move quickly so the reader can reach the bigger truth without a lot of obstacles along the way.  It is a book that stays with you long after it's finished and should be read by everyone.  I rate it a 9 instead of a 10 only because some of the writing is a little too simplistic.	1997-11-03

Some fool reviewer fed up with too many memoirs (are there too many novels being published, too, or just the bad ones?) said this was self-serving.  No s--- Sherlock.  It is after all his life story.  But just like every time I see a Rick Bragg byline in the NY Times I know the story under it is going to be something special, so, too this book.  It is a heart-warming and honest story, a story of a woman who loved her sons and desperately wanted them to have more than she did, which was a damaged drunk husband and poverty, to use Bragg's phrase, as big as God.  It's the story of a man who, despite the insecurity that is so human and appealing, belongs up there with the best of them. You almost feel envy that you grew up so privileged by comparison.  You want some of his character. The anecdotes about newspapering are great but this book is so much more than that.  I loved it.  My only complaint: at least a dozen typos some editor should have caught. They're disconcerting. But the	1997-09-22

It is a cliche found in too many reviews, but in this case it is true: Greene tells a story with the skills of a great novelist and without realizing it we are being told an awful lot of very important history and information here.  This books says so much about america and particularly the relationship betweens blacks and jews that it is a truly remarkable and valuable piece of work.  its the kind of book you wish you could write and would recommend to friends of all persuasions	1997-08-22

Roth had become so hard to read in recent years that I was reluctant to pick this up but I found it as enjoyable as anything he has ever done.  A pentrating look into the lives of my father's generation, men of limitless ambition but limited abilities.  It chilled me to the bone.  It said so much about being Jewish in America in the 20th century and about being american post world war 2 that it should be required reading in college history classes.  Of course, it is written in the typical roth prose, shining like a gem throghout.  I recommend this to everyone I know and even though it was slow in parts -- why is that such a crime?  isn't real life slow in parts, too? -- i was very sorry when it ended.  Mazeltov to Roth but this is a book for non-jews as well.  The Swede is one of the great characters of modern american fiction.  fantastic	1997-08-22

It makes one wonder about the overall veracity, but I still found the book extremely gripping and think it stands up for what it tries to do, tell a compelling story of a very difficult livelihood and the perils of commercial fishing.  The bottom line of the book cannot be questioned: it tells a harrowing story of being lost in a killer storm. I agree with some reader comments that comparing it to &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; is a disservice to both works.  &quot;Thin Air&quot; is extraordinary for the personal anguish of the author and the message it conveys loud and clear about the insanity of treating the mountain as if it were some personal playground for the macho and adventurous.  Both books are marvelously written and were among the best I read this summer but I would have to say Thin Air, like the mountain, towers over everything else I've read in the genre	1997-08-22
