Ian, a minister, is bothered more than he can admit of the seductive nude model - only he knows this woman could never fit into his conservative lifestyle.  When these two people fall in love, you expect a lot of problems and even humorous encounters.  Sandra Brown is a very good author, but I always believe she doesn't develop her stories to their full potential.  It seems obvious that this book could have been much longer than the 229 pages, and filled with more conflicts due to the very unusual pair.  If you are looking for a light simple romance, than this is it.  It is a very simple romance story.	2003-06-28

The police procedures are not researched very thoroughly, and the timing of events are seriously flawed.  The mystery was easily discovered, even though the facts didn't always add up, and there were a lot of unncessary information included while reading.<br />In addition, the story starts with a character list and description when some of them are merely mentioned and never take stage in the story.<br />I also found the romance to be a bit too flowery and unbelievable.<br />This is a light one or two day read, that I would not recommend.  Since the characters were not fully developed, the mystery pretty much ridiculous, and the read felt more like a chore.  I don't think I'll give this author another try anytime soon.	2003-06-27

This would have been an excellent book, if the author worked a little more on the contemporary language, developing the future/past relationship of the characters, and just plain given the story more attention.<br />Betty Brooks created some wonderful characters here, but didn't fully develop all of them... some had such tiny parts in the story, I wondered why they were created in the first place.<br />When Anne travelled a century into the past, she was somehow able to adapt easily to the new surroundings... stretching into her memories of camping with her grandmother.  However, camping in modern times is never that similar to travelling into the 1800s.<br />Ms. Brooks would have created a better story, had she shown the readers the differences in the modern and past communication styles.  Anne used modern language, that was easily understood by the characters in the past... even though some of these words meant other things in that time.  For example a kid, would be goats... not a child.  When Anne called herself an offensive curse word, the characters from the past didn't wonder why she was calling herself a female dog... but instead responded with &quot;you said it!&quot;<br />The disappointing thing about this is that it was such a good story, that had such promise... if only a little more care and attention would have been given to the differences to the past/present time frame.<br />In addition to the other problems I listed about the book, the ending wasn't complete.... there were so many loose ends.  When reading, I can see how talented Ms. Brooks is, however, a little more development of the story needs to take place... regardless of how long the story would become.  This could have been a wonderful romantic story, about some very warm and caring characters.	2003-05-23

The tale, although obviously unbelievable, takes one on a fun fantasy ride.  Elizabeth's travel to the past are created with a lot of humor and unusual circumstances.  The fact that she has no family or friends, gives you a strong indication of where she will make her final choice to remain when the choice becomes hers.

Chances Are is a wondeful story, filled with heartwarming characters, that will tug at your heart and make you eager to turn the next page.  This story is truly hard to put down.<br />Faith Butler somehow, through all her own trials, manages to be a shining light to all those around her.  Only can she get through to her new boss, Drake, who hides his scarred face behind dark curtains and unlit rooms.. who only chooses to show his disfigurement when attempting to scare others away from him.  Only Faith realizes that, although he attempts to scare everyone around him, a man that gives a desperate woman a job when turing her away would mean certain death for her daughter and probably starvation for her son and herself... must have a heart of gold.  Determined to find that heart of gold that he keeps locked away so tightly, Faith sets a direct path to thaw out the cold surface of her boss.<br />This story is truly wonderful, and I highly recommend it to others that have enjoyed historical romance tales.  Robin Lee Hatcher is truly a talented storywriter.	2003-05-11

This story is quite unusual, with what appears to be a rather ridiculous account of the India culture.

This is a very warm and entertaining story, with characters that are very endearing.

However, my two daughters (ages 5 & 6) found it a little long.  I have to admit, I even found it a bit too long.  All in all, it is a good story with a good lesson to teach your child... and one probably best for bedtime, since you may find your child asleep by the end.	2003-03-02

If your child reads this book by themselves, they may understand and follow it better... I'm not quite sure.  However, this is not a great book to read TO your children, unless you want to spend a lot more time discussing what is happening.  My girls were quick to say, \\"let's read something else next time.\\"  So, I'm afraid it wasn't enough for them.

I purchased the audio version of this book, and found it more rewarding.  The first time I played it, I picked up on the concept of the new discipline theory.  The audio provided many examples, and basically seems to be a simple theory.  I've tried using the positive discipline plan with my two daughters, and surprisingly it worked very well in many situations.  Very seldom did I have to resort to my old disciplinary behaviors.  My children prefer the new methods, and have become more verbal about their own punishments, and what they believe is fair and unfair.  Though we don't see eye to eye on these, we have the communication, and they do seem to be behaving a lot better and we are able to spend more time enjoying each other, instead of arguing or separated into different rooms.  When I replayed this tape after several months later, I was encouraged to continue this plan, and also to fine tune it with a few additional recommendations that were discussed.  I highly recommend this to all parents who wish to develop a stronger relationship with their children, and who wish to gain a little more respect from them as well.	2002-12-09

Though the book had a good plot, it seemed too rushed at times and way too slow at others.  When Bronwyn is betrothed to Adam Keane, she only hopes he is a nice man... not even her one request could be fulfilled here, when she meets him and sees how shunned he is by the woman he describes as &quot;ugly&quot; and plain.  As Bronwyn turns from the ugly duckling she once was, she begins to gain his attention... only who would want the attention from such a cruel and insensitve man?  The only time Adam Keane is kind is when his whole world falls apart, and he is vulnerable and needs help from others.  I found the characters quite shallow, with very little changes in their characters by the last page.  Also it was a little overdone on the topic that it is shameful for a woman of this time frame to be intelligent or clever - and the author's continuous examples just got tiresome.  Although I finished this book, it took great effort and I'm not real sure I can sit through another Christina Dodd book in the future.	2002-10-31

The characters were a bit too needy and petty.  There was a decent plot that I felt wasn't explored well enough.  The potential was definitely there, but the end result was as weak as the characters.  The idea that a man would be pining away for ten years after one failed romance, just seemed too far out there.  It would have been more believable if the past emotions came flowing back after they danced together in the high school during the reunion.<br />The anger that Logan held in for ten years, surely would have given him a heart attack or someting by now... and Dani's victim behavior just got plain old... for God sakes, stand up for yourself!!!  The ending was still a bit lacking, and the fact that the author's descriptions and supporting characters comments stressed these are the most perfect and most desirable people ever... just added to the unbelievable nature of the entire story.  I've seen many mixed reviews on Sandra Brown books, and will be willing to try another one since many other reviewers that I like stress how well some of her other books are... but this story was definitely a loser as far as I'm concerned.	2002-10-21

My 4 and 5 year old daughters said it was \\"boring\\" and didn't want me to finish... however, I insisted we finish what we started... and they constantly looked around the room and even sat on their hands trying to sit still until we did.  I even tried to ask a lot of questions and make it as interesting as I could... but truthfully this book would be better for children a little older than my own... or maybe a good book to read when your child is learning about this topic in school.

When the handsome Nick comes to town, insisting on calling on Tibbie - even when she so humorously demands his attention is unwanted.

Tibbie must then decide who is the right man for her, if any...<br />Although the story could easily have been told in about half as many pages, the writer does provide some entertaining communications and unique characters along the way.  At times, Tibbie's confusion gets a bit tedious... sometimes you just want to yell &quot;enough already!&quot;  But all in all, it was an enjoyable read, and quite funny at times.  The characters are all charming, and the urgency at the final outcome, is quite entertaining.

It's a simple book that can be read in a day or two, but it just didn't keep me long enough to do that.  Instead it took me almost a week to finish, because I just didn't care if I read it or not.  Unfortunately, I have to finish a book that I start... whether I like it or not... so in this case it was difficult.<br />The storyline is pretty good, however, just a little too detailed at times about thoughts and surroundings... just became a little too much.  I couldn't really care about the characters much, because although I knew all their thoughts and feelings, I never really understood their motivations for some of their actions.<br />The characters continuously contradicted themselves... which isn't a big issue, since real life people act that way many times while they are undergoing change - which these characters were.  There were too many details left unanswered or unresolved by the end of the story, and it seemed there should have been one more chapter to at least throw it all together.<br />The author constantly went back and forth with the hero and heroine's point-of-view so that the reader relived some events and moments repeatedly... becoming a bit too much.<br />This wasn't really awful, but I just didn't feel much for the characters or feel that I had to finish quickly to find out what's going to happen.  There were some moments that I found quite charming, but not enough to recommend or carry this book.  The moment when Sarah Ross Harris confronts Wesley Powell's father is almost ridiculous and quite impossible to believe that one could pull off such a scheme.  I'm not looking for reality in these books, but sometimes they do get a little to far out there... such as this one.	2002-09-23

My daughter brought this one home from the school library and found it quite easy to read on her own, needing very little help from me.  This is a very good book for early readers, as there are few words on each page... and they are rather simple.  I read this to my daughter first, then she read it back to me... and I found she was memorizing it... since there is only a sentence on each page, don't read it to the new reader but have them read it to you.  The hardest word is ladybug, but they'll know that one just by the pictures.  Otherwise, this book provides some simple facts about the insect that my child remembered much later when I asked about it again.	2002-09-23

When my daughter brought this home from her school library, I really dreaded reading it to her and seeing all the pictures.  I think that's why she got it, cause she always laughs at my reaction when I see any kind of insect.  However, this book was good for new readers, and she was quickly able to read me the entire book with ease.  There were not many challenging words for my 5 year old daughter.	2002-09-14

Very warm story about a woman and a man that find love together through the orphaned brothers, they both dearly love.  Both of them have their own issues of self-worth they must deal with, and the two children give them that reason to live and to deal with the issues they have spent so much time running from.  Each time it appears the family has found happiness, something else threatens the family that so desperately needs each other.<br />This is an very good story, that sometimes becomes a little tedious in all the complications.  The romance was a little to easy and perfect, but Rosalyn Alsobrook's books are usually this way.  However, it's a very good story that I do recommend.  I always enjoy Alsobrook's ties in with actual historical events and/or issues, this time it was tied into the historical Orphan Trains.	2002-09-14

With their house in shambles and getting worse every day, not to mention no heirs for the brothers to leave their ranch to if something should happen to them... it just seems like the logical choice for one of the brothers to get married.  Only Luke isn't going to buy his younger brothers belief of the oldest should marry first... so the brothers decide to draw straws to find out who the groom is going to be.<br />When the brothers show up at church, with Luke searching for the \\"biddable\\" bride to cater his every whim, the town is shocked to see the two brothers taking more of an interest in the town and church activites, and realize they must be ready to find wives.  Considering they are the most attractive men in town, and maybe the wealthiest ranch in the area as well, the single women are actively seeking their attentions.<br />When Luke spots the quiet and sweet Eleanor, he thinks he's found the perfect wife.  Since her parents have passed away, Eleanor is living with her Aunt and Uncle, and horrible cousin.  Simular to the old Cinderella story, Eleanor is nothing more than a free housekeeper to the family, and treated somewhat similar to the treatment Cinderella had to deal with.  Needless to say, Eleanor jumped at the chance to marry Luke - knowing it was not a marriage based on love.<br />From the moment Eleanor and Luke are married, you'll be laughing at the two, as they quickly begin to fall in love.  This is simply a historical romance of the old fairy tale, with a few twists.  The sensuality of this book is very low-key, but the humor and the unusual predicament the characters find themselves in - to their own making - is quite an entertaining read.	2002-09-03

The Tender Texan is an excellent historical romance that starts with the German immigrants arrival in Galveston, Texas, and their travels to claim land in Fredericksburg.  When Anna arrives in Galveston, after losing her cruel husband during the passage to America, she realizes that she will be unable to claim land as a widow.  Wanting nothing more than a home and land of her own, but realizing a woman won't be given land at the settlement, she must find a husband - and fast!  Holding her head high, she walks in the middle of a campsite full of rough Texans and offers to pay $100 to any man that will be her husband in name only for one year, until she can gain the land... with a promise to leave after the year is up.  Only one man is willing to take Anna up on the offer... and for the next twelve months the tension these two create when they are near each other is bound to keep anyone glued to the pages of this book!  There are many more conflicts that keep things interesting... such as the reason Anna fears all men, the conflicts of her past, the name Chance keeps calling in his sleep, and the reason he's seeking revenge, along with many other daily factors that continue to build up in their one year long relationship.  There isn't a dull moment in this story.  I would have given it five stars except for the words Chance whispers in Anna's ears of love.  These words are a little too flowery, and they just don't fit the character, in my opinion.  Otherwise, its the perfect historical love story, with a Texan flare.<br />There are little things that hint to a future book, as some major details are never resolved, and one villain continues to roam free from his sins.	2002-09-02

Captain Wade Williams of the Union Army is searching for Perry in order to try her as a traitor.  Wade is always a close step behind her, and Perry must take some daring moves in order to protect herself.  One of which is to pose as a boy in dirty clothes and a filthy hat.

While attempting to save the Captain and find him the medical care he desperately needs, Perry is taken directly into the hands of the Union Army and her enemy, Wade Williams - also Hunter's hated cousin.  Amoung these conflicts, Perry manages to remove her boyish costume at times, and Hunter starts to believe the woman he sees is merely a wonderful dream.  As he continues to dream and think of this beautiful angel, the two become closer and closer, and Hunter soon believes he's going insane with this impossible fantasy.  As his health returns, he tries to continue life without thinking of this angel of his dreams, but she's always in his thoughts.<br />There are many twists and turns, and unforgettable characters along the way that will keep anyone entertained from the first page to the last.

This was my introduction into the works of Fay Robinson, the 2001 RITA Award-Winning author, and it will definitely not be the last book I read from her.  She found a wonderfully new topic with this story, dipping into the world of deception within a very unique family, and presenting surprisingly warm characters that were enjoyable to read.<br />The other reviewers provided very detailed descriptions of what this book is about, however, I would like to add a few comments on the content of this book.  The details Ms. Robinson provided about the unusual career of scam artists, from the very simple to the very elaborate ways they \\"earn\\" their money, is alone a fascinating read.  However, add a little romance and a scam artist on the run from her own family, and then the father of her child, and you have a real winner!<br />I highly recommend this book, and find it refreshingly different and very entertaining.	2002-08-21

Of the 524 pages, the flood doesn't actually occur until you finish the first 400 pages.  Just where most romance stories would be ending, this one adds the tragic twist of the massive flood, taking the reader on a new journey of the tragic event that actually took place.  The writer describes the destruction with such detail and tragic fear, that I shudder to think what the actual people went through when this event actually occurred.  Especially when I think that my ancestors were living in Uniontown during this time, not far from Johnstown - but luckily out of harm's way of this floods' path.<br />Nevertheless, this is an excellent story with a great deal of sadness.  As you meet a variety of characters, as they experience a tremendous amount of normal day to day trials and successes, you soon realize that not all of them will make it through when the flood occurs.  Which of these fascinating characters will survive?  Who will perish in the massive currents of the enormous flood?<br />This is not a relaxed read... you know that these are fictional characters, but you also know the tragedy is real... so you cannot help but be moved by the mass destruction that is described, and the tremendous loss of life.<br />The romance is this story is a little too flowery, otherwise I would have given this a five star rating.  The main characters fall in love to easily, and too perfectly.  Otherwise this is an excellent story and historical romance.	2002-07-25

This is my third pregnancy and I just wanted to learn a little more about all the options and numerous tests I have been taking, and learn anything that is new from the last pregnancy.<br />This book took care of all that for me, and gave me things to watch out for... with the strong statement that if I do notice these symptoms, they could be nothing... better safe than sorry, and check them out.  I was happy to see the features that described all the different labor techniques, emergencies, choices, and more.  I didn't find this book frightening, as some of the other reviewers did.  Perhaps because I've had other children.  Nevertheless, I think it is an excellent book and reference book for the ever changing topic of pregnancy.  What others need to understand is that while childbirth and pregnancy is a natural event, there are still some dangers involved and it's important to know about them, and know the symptoms, as well as know how to take care of yourself during your pregnancy.  Don't let this book scare you, if you are not the kind of person that likes to know your risks, than don't read this book.  If you are a person that likes to take control of your pregnancy, knowing the risks and rewards, and understanding every aspect of your pregnancy and body changes, than this book is perfect for you.  It all comes down to how much information you really want.  Also, this book is not all about the risks... there is much information about the joys and wonderful experiences of pregnancy, as well.  Take this information into consideration and make your own choice.  The mixture of these reviews varies tremendously, from one star ratings to five, and the reason is the level of knowledge some of these people want to know about.  Pregnancy is a joyous moment, and if you cannot learn the risks and still be happy throughout your pregnancy, select a doctor that will take over your worrying, and tell you only what you need to know.  Otherwise, I believe this book to be very thorough and comprehensive.ke over your worrying, and tell you only what you need to know.

Suzanna Blackwell returns home for her father's celebration of his military service promotion, but this time maybe for good.  In her return, she is reminded of her distance from her father, and vows to strengthen that bond... but still living in the memory of her own mother, who died when she was a child.  In addition, Suzanna meets and begins a relationship with Michael - a member of the press, much to her father's disgust.  Michael and Mr. Blackwell have their own deep rooted feelings for each other, that cannot be hidden, due to their own painful past experiences.  All consequences and relationships of the current characters are influenced by past wars, and their actions in those wars.  If the relationship struggles were not enough to make an interesting story... the ghostly encounters will definitely intrigue you and pull you in.  While the living are trying to forget the past, the dead have their own agenda, and are not ready to be forgotten.  I found this book very interesting, however, it did drag on for most of the book.  Towards the end, it accelerated at a very fast pace, that proved exciting and frightening.  The closing was excellent, but left me with a few minor questions that were not quite cleared up.  Richard Setlowe proved to be an excellent writer, and my only complaint would be to spend a little more time on the characters emotions and thoughts... but I find most male authors provide more adventure and intrigue, and female authors tend to provide more emotions and deeper thought processes... not that I haven't found authors that were capable of both.  I would recommend this book to anyone that finds the topic of ghosts a little intriguing... there's no technical mumbo-jumbo here... well maybe a tiny bit in some explanations, but you won't notice as they are fit in perfectly.  If you give this a try... finish it!  You'll be glad you did... when you find it a little long and tiresome, stay with it.. it DOES get better!  I'll be keeping an eye out for other books by this author.with it.. it DOES get better!  I'll be keeping an eye out for other books by this author.	2002-06-22

If you are looking for a sweet story to curl up with, of about 180 pages, this is the perfect one for you.<br />Beth is a nurse that discovers her sister is suffering from MS, when her deceased brother-in-law's brother comes for her in order to bring her to her sister and help care for her.  Only Beth is distraught to discover that the presence of Thomas is still unsettling to her, ever since the short romance they had following her sister's wedding.  The memory of getting over him was still with her, and she saw his flirting as nothing more than an opportunity for more hurt.  Now here he was again, whisking her off to his house, where his sister has lived since her husband's death, and thinking the three of them could live happily together under one roof.<br />The flirting in this story is very enjoyable to read, especially the witty comebacks that Beth has for everything Thomas tries to say or do.  There was not a great deal of conflict, other than the stress Beth put on herself by analyzing everything Thomas said or did, and trying to prevent another heartbreak.  However, this is a wonderfully sweet and warm romance, that I really enjoyed.  I especially loved the sweet surprise ending.	2002-05-21

Danielle Steel is not your author... she understand that there is a lot of good in different people, and you can fall in love with many of them... and each one will give you a different direction of your life... not necessarily better or worse.	2002-05-13

Charles and Marielle seemed the perfect couple, but when tested with tragedy, Charles turns his anger and distress on his wife, and their marriage ultimately falls apart.  Many years later, Charles sees Marielle with her young son, then soon after he is kidnapped... is this a coincidence... does Charles have something to do with this?  All clues point to Charles, but we all know that is too easy... what's the real secret behind this story?  It's full of devious characters, and lots of tear jerking moments... a must read for all Steel fans.	2002-05-13
US	41934110	R2OMVN894LMDDN	0440214114	341522717	Mixed Blessings	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Wonderful and heartwarming stories	Danielle Steel created three couples that must make decisions of whether or not to have children, and how far they are willing to go to have, or not to have them.  Each story has sacrifices they must make, and each sacrifice comes with it's own reward or problem.  Danielle Steel is a wonderful writer, always providing unique conflicts and struggles, and not always the best ending.  This story is a bit unusual, as the characters are more everyday people and dealing with their inner conflict of defining their family, whether it be with or without children, to determine their lifestyle.  Very interesting and warm story.	2002-05-13

I really enjoy her early works the best, and the characters seem to be more realistic, though their struggles are heartwrenching and devastating.  This one is no exception.  It's hard enough to lose a spouse or a child, but to lose both... then have to raise a handicapped child that will never meet his father or sister... and to do this all alone... well, all I can say is Danielle Steel takes real life tragedies, and pushes them to find out how much her characters can take... then pushes them a little more.  This one will have you crying for the devastating loss, then crying for the heartwarming mother-son relationship.  There is so much more to this story, and anyone that has ever read Danielle Steel will know that her stories take you on a roller coaster ride, and make you walk away a different person than the one you were before.	2002-05-13

Danielle Steel put a different spin on this one, showing us the life through the eyes of the man... and showing what a dedicated father can accomplish, when his own world falls apart.  When his wife goes back to school, Oliver must take care of the house and children, as well as his own career.  Unfortunately, his wife continues to pull away... leaving us a great deal of emotions to read through of the children and the parents.  Pulling the family together may be an impossible feat, however, Oliver does his best and finds an outcome he can live with.  Danielle Steel is very talented, and in this story she dug deep into a problem that has routinely been made into stories about mothers... but this time the story is told about the father.	2002-05-13

I don't want to give too much away, so I'll make this review short and sweet.  This story will excite you, and warm your heart, then take a tear-jerking turn!!!  You'll feel sadness in ways you've never felt before.  The movie was just as good as the book in this one.  I never quite got over this book.  Don't read if you've dealt with a loss of a loved one, or a tragic illness in the recent past!!!  But save it... it's a wonderful story.	2002-05-13

Slowly her whole world slips away, and she realizes how alone she really is in her vigil for her daughters life... except for the strong handsome Trygve, who also has an injured daughter.<br />This is a very powerful and dramatic story, which will leave you a different person than when you started this book.

I loved every word of it, and was thrilled to discover it was the story of the wonderful twins, Trellis and Travor, first introduced in Midnight Blue by Dorothy Garlock.  Pack and Shannon Mara Gallagher are mentioned throughout the book, and my only complaint is that we didn't get to read about their arrival at the end - since we knew they were on their way to meet the twins' new wives!  After reading some of these reviews, I wondered if this book would be as good as the other books I've read of Ms. Garlock's... it was as good or better than any of them that I've read!!  The arrival of Travor, Trell's twin, did not arrive as corny as another reviewer mentioned... he arrived before Jenny and Trell spoke their love for each other.  This was an excellent book!!!	2002-05-13

Edwina is an amazing character, that literally gives up her hopes and dreams to take care of her siblings - after being orphaned from the Titanic disaster.  The character does what every big sister would probably do in the situation, but Danielle Steel puts it in words that makes us all face this.  As the youngest sibling in my family, it made me look at my oldest sister in a different light... would she make the same sacrifices for her crazy siblings?  I think so.  This is an excellent book... and one Danielle Steel's best!	2002-05-13

It's also my first Jude Deveraux, and I'll definitely be looking for more of both this author and this genre.  This story is so unique, and so heartwarming, that it's hard to imagine that someone could even make this stuff up... what an imagination!!!  It was a little difficult to follow at times, when the time travel switched back and forth... but even though it took me awhile to finish this book... it was well worth it.  This isn't the kind of book that you can rush through... each word takes you on a unique and welcome adventure.  Jude Deveraux did an amazing job with this book!	2002-05-13

Only he must fight his attraction to the golden-haired woman, that her father brought to the ranch to marry his son... even though Johanna was under the impression it was to only act as housekeeper on the ranch.  This tale is full of unpredictable twists and turns, that will keep you reading until you get to the last word.  I loved this story, and am anxious to read more of Ms. Garlock's books.	2002-05-13

The family she joins up with, lends her clothing... so not even owning the clothing on her body, she is thrust into the hard life of a wagon trail.

Kilkenny is working to bring the old town to life again.  Jane, as many of the other women, are almost running from their past lives, but each will learn you can't run and instead must face them head-on.  This story is full of interesting characters... from the sweet and scared Polly that is pregnant from a recent rape... Sunday, the strong and beautiful woman with a mouth like a man, and is just as strong as one too... and Jane Love, who is carrying the burden of a terrible secret, that she is sure will shame her if discovered.  From the very beginning, Jane begins receiving threatening notes... \\"I know who yu are.\\"... which make her desperate to leave the town of Timbertown, Wyoming.  However, T.C. is determined to keep her in the town, until he's ready for her to leave for his homestead ranch.<br />Also making their presence in this wonderful story is Colin Tallman - the son of Addie and John Tallman from \\"Yesteryear.\\"<br />Readers will also learn the fates of Amy and Rain Tallman from \\"Dream River\\" - the grandparents of Colin Tallman.  If you recognize the name Kilkenny, it is from \\"Midnight Blue.\\"  Moose Kilkenny was the bare-knuckle fighter that lost his title to Pack Gallagher... Moose is T.C.'s uncle.  Milo Callahan returns to Garlock's stories from a villain in \\"Sins of Summer\\" to a villain in this story.  Also mentioned in this book is Gerrick and Katy Rowe from \\"Nightrose.\\"<br />Now for those of you that haven't read all these other books by Dorothy Garlock, you are in luck.  You don't have to read any of them to follow along and understand everything that is happening.

Dorothy Garlock is an excellent writer, that always satisfies... and exceeds your expectations, with each and every book she writes.  This story was no exception.<br />If you take a look at all the reviews that I've written so far, you'll see that most of the books are Dorothy Garlock books.  When I picked up With Hope for the first time, I never even heard of her.  I just found the book in a box of books at my mother's house, and I was looking for something different to read.  I never imagined what effect it would have on me.<br />Now I probably read about twenty-five of the thirty plus books she has written... and this was since August 2001!!!  For a person that doesn't read about two to three books a year, that should say a lot!!!<br />I've been passing each and every one of Ms. Garlock's books to my sisters, mother, and grandmother - after I finish each one.  They like them as much as me, and the stories that I thought were great, but not her best, they liked even more.  We all have different tastes, but we all love Ms. Garlock's stories!<br />Nevertheless, this story is just as action-packed, and romantic as all of her stories.  You'll feel for the stress and terror that Dory felt each and every day of her life... finding relief only in her daughter and brother, James.  Dory and James are up against the world, or so it seems, as they try and survive their day to day life, at the hands of their step-brothers, Louis and Milo.  James, never really realizing how dangerous their lives were, until Ben comes to work at the logging mill run by Louis, Milo, and James.<br />Then the story is just like a ball of yarn coming unravelled, as it is rolled.  Each event that occurs brings Dory and Ben closer together, as well as makes their lives more dangerous in the process.<br />There is also a mystery of the Ben's deaf daughter, and then the love she discovers in James.  These two characters were so strong, and so enjoyable to read.... and easily could have been main characters in another story, without losing an ounce of charm.<br />This story is full of gunshots, murderers, a rapist, a questionable marshall, a mystery behind the mills accountant, and the strange family relationships and complications.  Everything comes to a head, and you feel the tension of the family, then it slowly unravels leaving you in awe over the truths that are discovered.aracters in another story, without losing an ounce of charm.<br />This story is full of gunshots, murderers, a rapist, a questionable marshall, a mystery behind the mills accountant, and the strange family relationships and complications.

There is not a wasted word or unnecessary character in this entire book!  I'd have to say this story is as close to perfect as possible!<br />The three romances that form during the wagon train are spicy, sweet, and intriguing!  Tucker and Lucas just set off firecrackers and sparks with every meeting.  Buck and Laura are sweet and endearing... a beautiful tale of a blind woman and a rough trail man.  Rafe and Marie were intriguing and mysteriously delicious.  Amazing to read about a woman of that strength and knowledge... although Ms. Garlock doesn't seem to write about weak women.  But of all things, the way the women managed to bond together and survive the hardships of a wagon trail, was endearing and very enjoyable to read.  Ms. Garlock is a genius, and it's hard to believe she wasn't actually there during the era she writes about, as the detail and the path she makes to your own imagination are superb.	2002-05-01

Rowe and Katy are a charming combination, as are Mary and Hank.<br />In the hard times of the frontier era, what would happen to two women and a little girl that are abandoned in a town, when all the treasure-seeking gold miners desert in search of more riches?  With only a small derringer, how can the women protect themselves?  They won't be able to stay in the abandoned town forever, and they are sure to face problems trying to get to another town.<br />When the mysterious bearded stranger comes into the abandoned town, along with his dog, the girls are not sure what to think of him at first.  The stranger, Rowe, bought the town, with plans to bring it back to life... and a mysterious connection with Katy, knocks him off his feet.<br />When some drifters come into town, and Rowe witnesses them murder one of their riders, it's up to him to protect the women.  From this moment on, Ms. Garlock creates one hurdle after another for these characters, and they get closer and closer as they overcome each and every one of them.<br />If you read Ms. Garlock's story, Midnight Blue, then you'll be pleased to read about the appearance of Pack and Mara Shannon Gallagher, and get an update on their lives.  Also from Midnight Blue, is a short appearance of Mara Shannon's villain cousin, Cullen McCall.  Nevertheless, if you haven't read Midnight Blue, you won't be missing anything, as Ms. Garlock provided everything you needed to know about these people, for the short appearance they made in this book.	2002-04-27

I just couldn't put this book down!!!<br />Mason purchases Victoria's ranch from her brother, while in England.  However, the ranch was not for her brother to sell, as it was left in a last minute will to Victoria.  Nevertheless, Mason shows up with the right paperwork, and deed of sale - and the will Victoria has that her father made out before he died, hasn't been recorded until she brings it in to her lawyer's office.  The will was witnessed by an employee at the ranch, and although it appears to be valid as well... Victoria and Mason must wait out the lawyer's research to find out who actually has the right to the property.  Only both Victoria and Mason understand that possession is nine-tenths of the law, so Mason refuses to stay anywhere but the ranch until things are settled.<br />In the meantime, Mason brings his two sisters and three brothers to the ranch... which further upsets Victoria, watching her home be taken over by this big family.  The family, determined to be together, and Victoria determined to be alone... all have some sacrifices to make.<br />It's a fun story to read, with these strangers being forced on each other... all trying to claim their legal property, but finding much more than a new home.  That's not all to the story, like classic Garlock quality, the story is full of gunshot wounds, villians and outlaws, and danger lurking from all corners.	2002-04-16

I really enjoyed reading of their escapades together.<br />Kain, the stepson of the vicious Adam Clayhill, meets Vanessa and her Aunt Ellie, and cousin Henry. The threesome are determined to travel to Junction City, and meet the brother of Ellie's dead husband (whom she was only married about a month to before his death) in order to locate kinfolk for her son, Henry. With no travel sense the trio are sure for some major problems, if not to lose their lives. Kain sees no other choice then to escort them to Junction City himself... although he's already discovered his strong attraction to the red-headed, Vanessa.<br />Ellie's son, Henry, is a simple-minded man and one of the main reasons the trio was taking this trip were because her fear of who would take care of him after she was gone, and not wanting to burden Vanessa with his care if she ever marries. She hoped they would find some kin, that would ease this fear for her. Ellie and Henry were not prepared for what they actually did find in Junction City. It seems there is no limit to the lives Adam Clayhill has destroyed... but you'll be pleased at the outcome of this story.<br />The double wedding that takes place in Junction City, will reunite the wonderful characters from the previous two books of this trilogy. You'll discover what has been occuring in the lives of Logan and Rosalee Horn, Cooper and Lorna Parnell, Arnie and Syliva Henderson, and many more. This reunion is perfect for the last of the trilogy... and what happens to the two villians, Adam and Della Clayhill, will give you satisfaction as well.<br />Along the way, you'll love the variety of characters from the two Texan brothers - Jeb and Clay, to John Wisner, and Mary Ben - the love of Henry Hill!	2002-04-12

Poor Logan spent his entire life being shunned by the white people, because of his Indian blood.  Labeled a half-breed, he's constantly given a cruel reception everywhere he goes.  Then one rainy night he shows up at Rosalee's home, needing shelter for his dying mother.<br />From then on, the two are drawn to each other... and Logan finds the one person in his life that didn't even consider his heritage or the consequences of their romance.<br />As much as Logan wants to give into the love he has for Rosalee, he doesn't want her to live to resent him, when she is surely shunned by the white people.  Rosalee must fight through the stubborness of Logan, and show him he does want to give into his feelings.<br />In addition, Logan and Rosalee - along with Rosalee's siblings and father, are suddenly facing serious danger by the huge landowner of the town.  Logan has his own reasons for taunting this landowner and purchasing the land bordering his, that he so desperately wants for himself.  Mr. Clayhill, the landowner, will stop at nothing to get what he wants... and the townspeople simply look away, not wanting to get involved and endanger their own family.<br />From beginning to end, it's almost impossible to see a way out for Logan and Rosalee... each small victory is overshadowed by a much bigger price.  Along the way, they make some unlikely friends... including Cooper Parnell, who will prove to be much more to them by the end.<br />Rosalee and Logan are wonderful characters, and I loved reading this story.

If you read other Garlock books, you'll be thrilled to find out the true identify of Emily and Charlie Rivers.  I loved reading about Zachary Quill, the son of Farrway and Liberty Quill, and hearing what's happening to others from Quills Station.	2002-03-22

I keep reading Dorothy Garlock, and I keep ending up surprised and thrilled at the end of each and every novel.  This one is absolutely wonderful!<br />Summer Kuykendahl, with her young brother, travel to west Texas in order to search for a safe haven for themselves, and hoping Sam McLean is the answer to that hope.  On her deathbed, Summers' mother pleads for her daughter to send a letter to Sam, promising that he will want to take care of them.<br />Only Sam has previously been killed, so his son, Slater, answers the email indicating she and her brother owned a plot of land with a cabin on it.  However, he signs it S. McLean - worried that Summer and John Austin won't come if they know Sam is dead.<br />Slater McLean is a tough Texan cowboy with a deep grudge, but a soft spot for the girl he knew for a short time as a child.  His face scarred from the attack that killed Sam, and swearing his cousin Travis is the cause of all this tragedy - leaves Slater hard and fearful of how Summer will treat him when she sees his scarred face, chest and back.<br />This story brings out some surprisingly shocking twists, and deeply hidden family secrets.  You'll be surprised at some of the events.  Keep in mind, every single woman in this story is stronger than they first appear.	2002-03-19
US	41934110	R10NJ1LEFSXGC4	0445203668	332912077	River of Tomorrow	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Another excellent tale from Dorothy Garlock!	Another excellent Garlock book.  Ms. Garlock is a master of including people from other stories and interweaving them through the lives she writes about, and this one was definitely no exception.  Mercy and Daniel are charming characters, with many of the traits of Liberty and Farr - the couple that raised them, and were featured in a previous book of this trilogy.  I was not ready for this story to end, and would also have liked to read about Farr and George, and Amy and Rain coming home.  However, Ms. Garlock made it very clear they were in route.  Nevertheless, I would have enjoyed the homecoming.<br />Mercy is not quite as strong as Liberty or Amy, from the previous books in this trilogy.  She did seem pretty dependent on Daniel, however, she was going through quite a lot, and that seemed only natural.  She held herself together very well, with her chin high and the same quick temper of Liberty Quill.<br />Their love story was so sweet and warm, and very enjoyable to read.  With the involvement of the family rival, Hammond Perry, still bent on revenge after all these years... the story keeps moving at a fast pace.  I found it hard to put down, like the others in this trilogy.	2002-03-14
US	41934110	R5ZYKWIZO0BPG	0445206764	779694118	Dream River	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Excellent... the best of this trilogy!!	I loved Liberty and Farr in the first of this trilogy - Lonesome River.  However, it ended without resolution of Amy and Rain together and in love.  This book will put the two together, and sure there was nothing keeping the two apart (like the other reviewer stated), except for a frenchman determined to have Amy for himself and several other dangerous encounters throughout the story.<br />The story begins eight years later from the first in this trilogy... with Liberty and Farr in complete happiness and with a growing family.... only Farr longs for a homestead that isn't quite as crowded as the booming town enclosing them.  Liberty senses Farr's edginess... and when Rain returns to the homestead, speaking of the virtually untouched land beyond the mountains, Liberty encourages the family to relocate.  Rain is excited that his extended family is anxious to move to the land he longs for, bringing the woman he craves along with them... as Amy has changed a lot and Rain's unsure of her feelings towards him... and still seems to make her so darn mad at him everytime they speak.<br />Rain volunteers to take a woman to her fiance, on his way to the new land.  For this reason, he must leave earlier than Farr and Liberty... but he manages to convince them that he needs Amy to come along... &quot;for appearances sake&quot;... while he and a rough riverman escort the spoiled and helpless woman.  Amy agrees to go along, mostly because the woman's eyes are on Rain.... while the rough riverman keeps his on the spoiled little rich girl.<br />Villans Hull Dexter and Hammond Perry return in this story, to add constant chaos and conflict for Rain and Amy, and Eleanor and Gavin during their travels.  Though Rain and Amy expressed their love shortly after their travels began, and stayed together to the end... there were numerous conflicts trying to pull them away from each other.	2002-03-10

Spectacular... intriguing... suspenseful... romantic... touching... fun, and more!  This is now one of my favorite Dorothy Garlock stories.  Liberty is the perfect main character... feisty, defiant, and bold!  I loved reading along as her temper gets the best of her... frequently!!!  Farrway Quill is the typical strong woodsman that Ms. Garlock tends to write about... but with much more substance (though I still haven't found a better male character than Johnny Henry from Garlock's With Hope series).<br />Characters from \\"Love and Cherish\\" appear (Juicy, Rain Tallman... and Sloan and Cherish Carroll's son, Colby Carroll) appear throughout the book.  Rain and Colby being Farrway's closest friends.<br />Though the time and location of the setting of this story is surrounded by the struggle of land between the indian and white man... this story tackles another danger, the struggle of the white man and what he will do for power.  All of Ms. Garlock's books include a high respect for the indians, but also shows savages in both the indians and the white man.  This book is no exception... and you'll be amazed at the strength of Liberty Carroll and the strength others find in themselves when near her.<br />This story thought ended beautifully, left some interesting untied ends of revenge and love, knowing they will be settled in the next book - Dream River.  I'm anxious to read this book, and excited that it is about Rain Tallman... as every time he appeared in this story, his character just stood out among all others.	2002-03-06
US	41934110	RPFGYS1VR6XHK	0446363723	174449207	Almost Eden	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Not bad... but...	I didn't enjoy this Dorothy Garlock story as much as her others. I really liked Light when I was first introduced to this character in Annie Lash... but didn't find Maggie very memorable or appealing to carry off as a main character. She was interesting as a supporting character in Annie Lash, however.  My mother and sister thought otherwise and loved this story... so if you were intrigued by Maggie and Light in Annie Lash, you will really enjoy this one.<br />Eli and Aee were a charming character, and would have made a perfect main pair of characters. There were many interesting conflicts in the story, including river pirates and hostile indians... and a couple surprises along the way. The conflicts seemed to take quite a long time to reach their conclusion... with little substance in between.<br />I found it very difficult to relate to either Maggie or Light, however, some of the supporting characters surrounding them were quite charming and intriguing. Light was, however, intriguing and fun to read. Maggie, on the other hand, was not much more than a spoiled child... though with strong dedication to Light, she had little other substance. It was exciting to hear more about other characters that I read about in Annie Lash.<br />As much a fan I am of Dorothy Garlock, I have to say this is the only one that I was capable of putting down each night. Ms. Garlock is an excellent writer, and this is a good story with some interesting characters.... it's just not her best.<br />I still gave her three stars, cause it was good reading... and I find even her worst stories are better than all other historical romance writers.<br />I will be reading Lonesome River next, and will post my review soon.	2002-03-01

This story is full of exciting twists and turns, with a very spirited and independent female character.<br />There are two very touching and emotional love stories within these pages, that will keep you intrigued to find out what's happening next.

However, although Sharli was ill, I felt her character wasn't strong enough in mind.  With her life basically being taken away from her, I would expect her to be more headstrong and independent in having the best kind of life she could.  She seemed easily pushed down into the direction her parents would put her in.  When she has a chance to really live, she barely fights for it.  Good story, and believable... however, I would have liked to find a stronger character in mind to more actively go after what she wanted, or needed.  In addition, I felt her parents were unreasonably hard, and almost unloving.  I had to force myself to finish this book, and then was very disappointed when I did.	2002-02-20

This is a sweet and action-packed story, with the love story of Berry and Simon and Rachel and Fain.  Dorothy Garlock is a master of creating memorable characters.... and this is one of her best.<br />Berry and Rachel are two strong female characters, that overcome numerous hardships, but always help each other through them.  Their troubles seem to grow and grow, and even the strong characters of Simon and Fain get drawn into their bad luck.<br />This book is full of romance, intense action, and lots of suspense.

No, this is not Ms. Garlock's best... and no, there is not quite enough emotional conflict to carry the story for the 343 pages.  However, it is a sweet story.  If you're looking for a simple story without too much conflict, this is it!<br />Cherish spends the entire book letting Sloan determine the route of the relationship, and giving into his every whim.  Unlike most of Ms. Garlock female characters, Cherish is quite dependent on Sloan.  Otherwise, it's a good story.	2002-02-13

Although I feel her writing is very well, I did not feel a desperation for Maxi's (main character) success in saving her father's magazine business.  Maxi is a spoiled girl, that will be worth millions whether or not she saves the magazine or not.  The only desire she has to save the business, is to continue her father's legacy - but even that doesn't seem urgent.  However, it seems from the story that her father put his business well above his children.  To me, I believe the story was shallow and none of the characters were worthy enough for me to feel emotions on their success or failure.  Quite a bore for me, but well written.	2002-02-10

I couldn't put this book down, and am now anxious for my next Dorothy Garlock book!<br />Tension and excitement are found on every page, as Letty and Mike fall in love, then lose each other due to Letty's father.  When Letty - fifteen, pregnant, and terrified - seeks out her grandparents that she doesn't even know, in hopes they will take her in until Mike finds her, you can feel the fear with every word Ms. Garlock writes.  Throughout the story, you feel all the growing pains of Letty as she becomes a woman and mother.<br />Mike Dolan comes home from working in the logging camp to hearing that Letty has become ill and died at her grandparent's farm.  Mike begins a reckless life when joining the war, and when he finally gets out... decides to visit Letty's gravesite, hoping he'll be able to move on.  Only instead of a gravesite for his dear Letty, he finds out she is alive... and with another last name... could she actually be alive??  ... and is she married???<br />In addition, the story includes murder and threats from Letty's family after many years... these items will keep you turning the pages!<br />This is a touching story, and if the romance doesn't draw you in... the relationship of Mike Dolan with his son, Patrick, will.  Great story... and as always with Ms. Garlock, great selection of characters!!!	2002-02-08

This story is a tale of deception, kidnapping, and love.  Devlin Hawke is a charming character, and I would be interested in reading more of this family.  The story is good, with complex twists and turns that are not overwhelming.  However, there are many turns of the story that are too outstanding, and just not believable.  I enjoyed this story, but found much of it far-fetched.  Nevertheless, the characters are genuinely interesting and charming... as is the basis of the story.	2002-02-06

The story of Nathan and Shelby, best friends as young children until the mystery of the river monster creates circumstances that ultimately causes Shelby and Nathan to part.  When they are reunited in the same small town many years later, they rediscover each other, as well as the mystery of the river monster, the suspicious activities of the lab by the river, conflict from Shelby's uncle, and the secrets each of them carry about the lives they led since their early departure.<br />The romance between Nathan and Shelby is sweet and innocent from the beginning to the end.  My only complaint is the emotional connection of the two never seem very climatic, no desperation or urgency to be together.<br />This is a touching story of friendship, love and loyalty.  Most of all, danger and very unpredictable mystery.  Any hopeless romantics will love the surprise ending!!!	2002-02-06

This book consists of three complete novels, one each from Dorothy Glenn, Joan Hohl, and Dixie Browning all with a connection of making the hero &quot;a Daddy again.&quot;<br />The first, &quot;Sunshine Every Morning&quot; from Dorothy Glenn (also known as Dorothy Garlock) is a sweet love story that begins with heartbreak that quickly turns to a sweet love story.  When Gaye loses her baby during birth, she is swept into the life of Jim Trumbull and his newborn grandson from her own sister.  Jim drives Gaye crazy, as she quickly falls in love with this big man and his dear grandson.<br />The second, &quot;Forever Spring&quot; from Joan Hohl is another sweet love story of a millionaire that falls deeply in love with the owner of a small bed and breakfast.  The couple quickly develop a dear sweet bond and passionate relationship, however her ex-husband quickly attempts to sabatoge the relationship, even using their two sons to do it.<br />Finally, &quot;Hazards of the Heart&quot; by author Dixie Browning is a love story of two former high school classmates.  Jake Hatcher doesn't even remember Libby, however slowly becomes dependent on her, until he can think of nothing else.<br />All three stories are sweet and loving, the first story is definitely the best... and the final story, &quot;Hazards of the Heart&quot; really drags on a bit and the author seems to try hard to make Libby undesirable by all means... and Jake Hatcher the perfect catch... got a little tiring - not my favorite by any means.<br />Dorothy Glenn was very unique and loving.  It's a very sweet story, one that shouldn't be missed.  If you enjoy this, read Dorothy Glenn's stories under the name Dorothy Garlock.  She definitely improved upon changing her pen name, but this is a very good story.  I love the unique storyline!	2002-02-01

The chemistry between Nelda and Lute is electric... as are the fights they are almost guaranteed to get into with every meeting.<br />Nelda, a stubborn woman forced to grow up too early when her strict father tears her away from the man she so desperately loves, when she becomse pregnant as a teenager.  Obviously the relationship Nelda had with her parents has left her with a low self esteem, that when Lute tries to court her, she picks up and twists every word he's ever said to her disadvantage... too scared to again feel the pain of the first time she lost him.  She quickly decides she would be inadequate as a farmer's wife, and Lute will quickly tire of her anyways... so she is determined to make a clean break, only after she's already too far gone and with a broken heart.  Will Lute come after here?  Of course!  But the twists and turns of this story, and the emotional chemistry between the two are sure to start a fire at every meeting.<br />Lute, a charming farmer... terrified to feel the pain of a broken heart, and knowing the sophisticated career city girl that returns to her grandparents farm will surely bring to surface the unbearable pain that has been quietly lingering since the day he first lost Nelda.  He's drawn to her, and cannot help but get close to her again... but each time he crosses the line, he reminds himself that Nelda is a city girl, and would never be satisfied as a farmers wife.  Too scared to get hurt again, he lashes out at her with words that play like a tape recorder in her head, after every encounter.<br />Everyone of the friends they make see how much the couple are in love, but their own pride and misunderstandings keep getting in the way.  It will take one thing to break the vicious cycle, and maybe a little intervention from a good friend.<br />This is an excellent story, and I was surprised to read the other reviews on this site.  Towards the end, I do think it dragged a little too much, however, it still supplied great memories that added to the final result of the story.  I would have given this five stars, however, I've read other Dorothy Garlock books and seen how talented she truly is... this is an excellent story... not her best, but still one of the best I ever read.  If you are a first time Dorothy Garlock reader, grab the With Song series.  It's my favorite series.  This is not a series, as many of her books are... but very good!<br />Enjoy!he end, I do think it dragged a little too much, however, it still supplied great memories that added to the final result of the story.

The nearby farm houses the town bully, that leaves many of the residents of Fertile, Missouri in fear.  What happens when his son, Evan Johnson, returns from the war to care for the family farm so his father doesn't drive it into the ground, and then finds himself falling in love with Julie, and desperately trying to prove he is not like his father.  Julie, believing she is nothing more than an old spinster, permanently tied to the care of her siblings, that doesn't have the heart to ever marry and leave them - feels confident that her place will never be as a mother or wife.  When that dream actually seems like a possibility to Julie, she must face her deepest and darkest secret to the love of her life, and await his reaction.<br />There are many more twists, including a new police chief in town with his own secret agenda - who also has his eyes set on Julie, a spoiled widow set on finding a new husband that sets her eyes on Evan Johnson and then on Julie's father.  When she manages to become a guest of Julie's father in the Jones family farm - she creates tons of chaos, fears in the hearts of Julie and her siblings, and stress deep enough to break ties of the strong and loving Jones family forever.  Among other problems, the town must face there is a rapist among them, and all eyes are pointing at Evan Johnson and his father.<br />This is an explosive and loving family story, with dark secrets and deep passions that are threatened to go without relief.  Dorothy Garlock is a genius in character development, and this book is no different.  Within the entire story, you'll also experience the effects the family must endure, due to the sign of the times of the 1920's.<br />I'm sure you will love this historical romance, and if so... check out other Dorothy Garlock historical romance books - this is one of my favorite... but not her best!!!

Why this series hasn't been grabbed for a mini series is beyond me... it has all the best qualities!!!!<br />The romance is so powerful and strong, I couldn't put the book down.  I read this one in two days, and was left breathless for more!  Luckily, &quot;After The Parade&quot; was waiting for me!  You won't be disappointed.  If you read any of Ms. Garlock's books, read this one!!!  You do not have to read the series in order, there is enough information cleverly included so that you don't miss a beat!	2001-11-18

I don't think Ms. Garlock could get enough of Johnny and Kathleen Henry either, as she created another masterpiece centered around this couple!  I read this book in 2 days, and found it to be just as good or maybe better than the previous book, &quot;With Heart.&quot;  I don't know what I'll do without reading about the people in this family... It was really easy to grow to love these fictional characters, and I long for more!!  I hope Ms. Garlock continues with some of the other characters in this book.  READ THIS BOOK... YOU'LL BE IN LOVE WITH JOHNNY AND KATHLEEN HENRY, TOO!!!	2001-11-18

Dr. Seuss is a favorite in our house... always fun and silly, and the kids always want to make up their own Dr. Seuss-style phrases or stories (which is a good game for the imagination).  Dr. Seuss has never been a great choice for us on bedtime stories, gets my kids acting a little too silly at times.  But it's a fun one for us to read any other time.  You can't go wrong with Dr. Seuss... a guaranteed good time!  This one is one of the best!!!  Funny, captivating, unusual, with a good solid message that you'll be proud for your children to learn - accepting the differences in others!  This is the classic way to teach children that reading can be a lot of fun!!! You'll find yourself reading this one over and over again!	2001-11-16

Our family enjoyed looking for other items of similar shapes in our own home, while we sat and read this book together.  That became a very enjoyable game for even my older toddler, who was no longer interested in board books.  The one reference to &quot;fat&quot; and &quot;thin&quot; will actually make a good time to discuss how some words can be hurtful to others, and how to avoid them.  My toddler surprised me with her sensitivity and ability to understand this complex matter.	2001-11-15

The idea of the story (picky eater) is definitely an issue that children can understand, as well as parents.  The story is clever, but some of the writing leaves a little to be desired.  The phrases &quot;...said Max's sister, Ruby&quot;, &quot;said Ruby&quot; is said seven times in the storybook... there are only ten pages... and &quot;said Max&quot; is written three times.  Those phrases are always the ones that distract my child away from the story... and this one was no exception.	2001-11-15

We counted the books on the bookshelf, the flowers in the vase, the marbles in a bowl, etc.  The book started an enjoyably simple and educational game.  Go ahead and get this book for your young toddler, it's simple, however enjoyable if you take it a little further.	2001-11-15

My daughters (ages 4 &amp; 5) really enjoyed this story, and I found it refreshingly charming and very enjoyable to read over and over again!  I'll be looking for more books from Ms. Southwell, that's for sure!<br />You can almost hear the sights and smell the scents of the countryside, when reading this wonderful book.  Most importantly, it's simplicity reconfirms the ideals of the country.  I highly recommend this for all young children, both boys and girls!	2001-11-15

It provided not only the entertainment of being spooked, when reading in a dark room, with only a light bright enough to read the pages, however it also provided a great deal of historical information about the area/house/building/etc. that is believed to be haunted.  The author writes about haunted locations that she's actually experienced.  However, the majority of the book is written about the experiences of others.  I think you'll truly enjoy this book, I'm planning on purchasing the author's book about hauntings in the Gulf Coast Region of Texas - a little closer to home!	2001-10-24

This was my favorite when I was a child, and I can happily recall my mother so sick and tired of reading this book to me, that she actually tried skipping a page or two.  But I always caught her, and made her go back and read it!!<br />Now, I read it to my kids... it doesn't help get them to sleep though.  In fact, it only gets them more and more excited and silly.  But it's a family favorite, and I'm sure it will be a family favorite for your child.  What educational value does it have for children??  Well, it does help teach children to rhyme.  The silly rhymes of the story, encourage the children to start making up their own.  And it's all in fun!!	2001-10-17

This book is small enough for toddlers to hold with ease, and is made with heavy cardboard, instead of the normal pages of other books - easier for kids to turn the pages.  My daughters loved this when they were two years old, and occasionally they like to read it again just for memories.  The illustrations are great, and entertaining for young readers.  The book is an excellent book for new readers to start with, as it has few words, and easy for them to build their confidence.	2001-10-17

Dorothy Garlock created a wonderful collection of characters in this novel based in the 1930s.  The only bad thing about this book, was closing it and letting go of these characters.  I've fallen in love with the main characters - Henry Ann Henry and Tom Dolan... but most of all, for her step-brother, Johnny.  I so hope, as I believe the other readers will too, that Ms. Garlock will write a novel with Johnny as the main character someday.  He's simply charming and easy to fall in love with.<br />The main characters provided a spectacular chemistry of emotion, while the world around them suffered with the hardships of the time.  However, they were not completely unaffected, they did suffer as well, along with witnessing the suffering of those around them they cared about.<br />The one thing that Ms. Garlock did create was characters that were obviously bad... when sometimes actually there is a fine line between bad and good within a person.  The story would have been even more emotional if those characters showed more of their good, along with some of their evil.<br />Overall, a very good book with wonderful characters, that you are sure to enjoy!	2001-10-17

The book gives as much detail as possible, while telling the stories that were told to the author.  There are some pictures, and those in the San Antonio area should be able to locate many of the locations with just the information in the book.  The historical information, including the information about who the ghosts are believed to be at each location, add even more excitement to this already mysterious and intriguing topic.  Do I believe in ghosts?  I don't think so, but it's still fun to read about others imagination - or maybe their experiences ---- how would I know?  Nevertheless, give it a try - especially if you are in Texas - and most definitely if you are in or near San Antonio!  I think you'll enjoy it!	2001-10-16

One word can describe this story, \\"Excellent.\\" It was suspensful and unique from the first to the last page. The author has a unique writing style that intrigues me to search for more of her stories.  This particular story will make you think from beginning to end... and I bet you'll be surprised at the conclusion!  The emotions are high, and the storyline is terribly frightening... even the name of the book is downright scary!!!  Read this one... you'll be glad you did!!!!	2001-10-10

The storyline was easy to follow, right to the mystery person!  There were details dropped in a much too obvious way, that put a spotlight on the mystery.  So for half of the story, you are reading for the romance factor of the characters, and wondering when they will see the obvious trail that you've already seen.<br />Also, some of the reasoning wasn't very believable... but like I said... this is light reading, and the characters are charming to read about.<br />The romance was a bit too corny, but the characters were charming and easy to like.  The authors writing is very well actually, and I would be interested in reading more from her.	2001-09-17

It was very depressing, with all the characters having these horrible lives and turn of events.  No real personal growth, just more and more tragedy.  I sure don't remember people in high school with that attitude or filled with that much hate.  It takes those points WAY out of the realm of reality.  Not something I'd recommend for anyone.	2001-09-17

It's been a couple years since I've read this one, but reading some of these reviews, reminded me just how much I loved this book!  I'm going to purchase more of her books right now, I've really missed her style of writing.  I found this book unpredictable, but then this book was one of my introductions into mystery books.  This is the only Tami Hoag book I've read, and I am anxious to see some more.  If you have not read any of her books, I'd highly recommend you pick this one up.  I can definitely vouch for this one, as being a keeper... and highly entertaining mystery!	2001-09-17

Some very interesting facts are in this book. However, the book is dry and boring. So much work went into putting this book together, that it's a shame there wasn't a ghostwriter working with Mr. Garrett to capture the emotions and the urgency in what could have been a fascinating book. I'm afraid I only got halfway through this book, before I gave up. I hate to walk away from a book without finishing it... but there was no way I could finish this story.	2001-09-17

I'm afraid that I just didn't enjoy this book at all... found it too filled with facts that did not interest me, or add to the storyline.  Perhaps knowing the fate of the fishing boat and crew did not help.  In many ways it was more like reading a book report about an event in history.  If you are interested in the lifestyles of fisherman, and the job... maybe you'll find it more interesting than I did.  Otherwise, the writing was very good and informative... but not very entertaining.	2001-09-17

This was really good. It's about various women that helped shape the Civil War, whether by being Spies, Soldiers, Journalists, Angels of Mercy, or whatever. You'll be surprised how far some of these women went for their cause, and how much they accomplished in that time frame that provided them with so little independent resources.  This book is a good introduction into these women, that may trigger your interest to learn more about them.  I wish it provided even more information on these people, but basically it seemed to be a book to introduce you to these women and tell of their actions, then go locate more information about them.	2001-09-17
