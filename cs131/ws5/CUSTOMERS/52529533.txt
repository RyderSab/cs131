Dick. The themes treated in NOW WAIT FOR LAST YEAR are not a surprise for those of us who have read the precedent books of the american writer. But, in this book, Philip K. Dick succeeds perfectly in the alchemy of the plot.<br />An alien invasion that is never happening, a commander in chief of the Earth population who could be a simulacra, a dangerous drug that is altering time and reality, an average character who has to act as an hero in order to save the humanity : all these themes have already been treated by Philip K. Dick. But not with so much empathy - a fundamental word in PKD vocabulary - in the description of the feelings of his characters.<br />In my opinion, the relation between Eric and Katharine Sweetscent, the doctor and his drug-addicted wife, marks a turning point in the evolution of Dick's literary skills. Hate, Love, Regrets and Empathy hadn't been until then so masterfully painted under Dick's pen.<br />NOW WAIT FOR LAST YEAR is one of PKD's books that could let you enter the unique imaginary world of this american writer. Don't hesitate to open the door.<br />A book for your library.	2001-09-10
US	52529533	R388FQ021IAAKB	9993534382	22746149	Because the Night	Books	4	9	10	N	N	OPUS  FOUR	Second novel of the Lloyd Hopkins saga, BECAUSE OF THE NIGHT has been published in 1984. Like in BLOOD ON THE MOON, James Ellroy has adopted in this book two points of view, Lloyd's and John Havilland's, the killer.<br />Even if the twists of BECAUSE OF THE NIGHT are highly improbable, the novel still stays as intense as it was when I first read it seventeen years ago (gasp!). Ellroy was then one of the first writers to introduce serial killers in his books and was already a master in describing the psychology of his characters.<br />What strikes me the most now is the evident relation between the mad psychiatrist Havilland and the writer Ellroy. The symptoms of Havilland's madness are very similar to the creative process of the writer. Havilland tries to recreate traumatic scenes of his childhood by directing &quot;live&quot; the poor souls that have fallen in his trap. How not to recognize here the endless efforts of James Ellroy in order to exorcize his mother's murder books after books ?<br />So if you have the curiosity to go beyond the main argument of BECAUSE OF THE NIGHT, you will soon find out that this book is not only a unique opportunity given to the reader to analyze Lloyd Hopkins thanks John Havilland's psychological skill but is also a terrifying trip through James Ellroy's own obsessions.<br />A book to rediscover.	2001-09-05

One will find in it good ideas but scarcely developed.<br />Later in the 21st century, the world population can decide to be cryogenized in order to quit for a while a society dealing with an endemic unemployment. Those who choose this solution are stocked in piles waiting for a better day. In the meantime, Jim Briskin, the black candidate to the U.S. presidential election, needs desperately new political ideas to gather votes. Incidentally, a little hole that has appeared in a translator seems to lead into a new world and could be the long-awaited solution to the cryogenized people problem.<br />Well, one recognizes in CRACK IN SPACE some of Dick's themes as the emergence of an unknown world that defies the intelligence of politicians and scientists. But don't forget that a &quot;new world&quot; in Philip K. Dick's terminology is not a world that suddenly appears light years away from the Earth, it's rather a world that is close to us, so close in fact that this world often exists in the mind of the characters only.<br />In short, if you want to make an agreeable trip through Philip K. Dick's main obsessions, you may enjoy CRACK IN SPACE but if you still don't know this writer , try UBIK or BLADE RUNNER first.<br />A book for Dick's fans only.	2001-08-14

Both men have suffered a traumatic sexual experience in their teen days. Lloyd Hopkins has become the best criminal investigator of the Los Angeles Police Department and spends his life protecting &quot;the Innocence&quot;. On the contrary, &quot;The Poet&quot; has developed a serial killer syndrome and murders young women, repeating indefinitely the same vengeance scheme.<br />Unlike Fred Underhill, the main character of CLANDESTINE, Ellroy's precedent book, Lloyd Hopkins doesn't consider his job as redemptive, he simply sees it as the most important thing in his life and will therefore lose his wife. He is a missionary to whom to be the best means to  be alone, in his job and in his life.<br />I've liked a lot the way James Ellroy compares the psychology of his protagonists who have to react in front of the same situations. I also remember very well the shock I had when I discovered BLOOD ON THE MOON in 1985 ; it was the first time in my life as a reader that I had the feeling that a thriller could be also literature.<br />A book for your library.	2001-08-08

New experiences, long conversations with his neighbour Doc Evans, the contact with nature will replace the tranquillizers. It's an healthy story.<br />The themes treated in FARMER are universal : love, death, friendship, regrets.

Fred Underhill is a young talented cop who believes he has found some clues proving that a serial killer is at work in the Los Angeles area. We are in 1951, in the middle of the Korea war, and the americans see communists everywhere.<br />In his mystical quest, Fred Underhill will meet Dudley Smith, a L.A.P.D. lieutenant who'll have the career we know under James Ellroy's pen. Smith or/and the author does have an obsession : the &quot;Black Dahlia&quot; mystery he has been unable to solve. It's the second time in two books that Ellroy evokes this affair that will give a few years later its name to one of James Ellroy's most known novels. Another recurrent Ellroy theme appearing in CLANDESTINE is the description of the death of one of the serial killer's victim, similar to the circumstances of the death of the writer's own mother.<br />Fred Underhill is also a golf addict and a tormented human being who'll seek redemption during the five years he'll pass in order to solve the case he has discovered. I must confess that the last fifty pages of CLANDESTINE are so gripping that I couldn't leave the book for one minute before its ending.<br />A book to rediscover.	2001-07-15

Dick's THE THREE STIGMATA OF PALMER ELDRITCH has been  published in 1965 and belongs to the masterpieces written by the american author. As in MARTIAN TIME-SLIP, another PKD first-class book of the same period, Dick gives here a tremendous life to the inner visions of his characters.<br />It's the first time in his literary career that PKD develops religious issues in a book. Only maybe the 1957 EYE IN THE SKY, a book which could be considered as a prelude to THE THREE STIGMATA OF PALMER ELDRITCH had such mystical considerations in its plot. In TSPE, Dick clearly suggests that the illusions provoked by the drugs are similar to the Holy Mysteries revealed during religious celebrations.<br />Important themes developed in a magistral manner, inner visions described in the unique PKD style and, more important, the ability to create a novel with three or four novelettes linked tightly together, everything indicates that Philip K. Dick, in 1965, is at the beginning of the sumptuous literary career he will develop from the mid-sixties until his death.<br />A book for your library.	2001-07-11

A certain number of themes one will find in later novels are already present in BROWN'S REQUIEM : the &quot;Black Dahlia&quot; mystery, corruption in the L.A.P.D., a fascinating serial killer or the main character searching for redemption.<br />I liked a lot the unusual descriptions of the world of the golf's caddies or the immoderate love of Fritz Brown for classical music. For a first novel, it's clearly a winner and I recommend it to those of you who want to discover the venomous world of James Ellroy.<br />A book for Tiger.	2001-07-09

BLOODMONEY. In both novels, one can find material for at least four or five other books but infortunately the different themes don't get along very well in the same novel.<br />In THE ZAP GUN, the main theme is political and has already been treated the year before in THE PENULTIMATE TRUTH : humanity is clearly separated in two fractions, people who know the Truth and people who don't know it. If you happen to know it, you will be extracted from the common masses and belong to the ruling class. Another themes treated are a treacherous alien invasion, Empathy that will maybe save the world and cause the alien to depart, tragic romances and pharmaceutics. In fact, nothing very new for the PKD faithful fan. But remember ! an under-average book from Philip K. Dick is still better than the majority of today SF production and always offers 4 or 5 hours of sheer intellectual pleasure.<br />A book for ultra-hard PKD fans. Like me.	2001-06-30

Dick, by the sole power of his words, was describing books after books virtual mental universes that were a lot more frightful than those our beloved techno-directors try vainly to shape nowadays. Among the four novels he published in 1964, MARTIAN TIME-SLIP and CLANS OF THE ALPHANE MOON were treating this Dickian theme by essence.<br />After an interstellar war that ended 15 years ago, the world has forgotten this alphane moon and its inhabitants. Alpha III was considered as a giant hospital for mentally ill people by the Earth; now maniaco-depressives, schizophrenics and obsessive have founded cities and try to leave peacefully. But Alphans and Earth want to retake possession of this forgotten moon for obscure political reasons.<br />If you liked EYE IN THE SKY, a novel published 7 years before by PKD, you will appreciate CLANS OF THE ALPHANE MOON and its numerous points of views. The same events are described and analyzed by the different characters and one is lead to understand very soon that there is no objectiveness in Reality and that the actions of so-called sane people often obey to rather perverse motivations. Anyway, if you're a Philip K. Dick fan, you already know by now that there is no such thing as Reality !<br />A book to discover if you are lucky enough to find it.	2001-06-12

Pete Marino and Lucy were also well described second roles and the serial killers involved in the stories very disturbing. I was then pretty sure that Patricia Cornwell would become one of the major crime stories writers of the years to come. But with books and years passing by, I realized that I was wrong : Patricia Cornwell is a one-and-only idea writer. And the soup, more and more salted, isn't digestible anymore.<br />So, like in the precedent Cornwell books, we have in BLACK NOTICE a serial killer on the loose, Lucy with a new girl-friend, rain and snow in Virginia ( is there such a season as spring downthere anyway ? ),  a bad guy among Scarpetta employees ( this is not a spoiler, it is a recurrent theme in Cornwell's books ), pizzas and soups cooked by Kay, a deficient alarm system, Mercedes, three showers a day for Kay, a computer related subplot and a lot of scientific terms in order to remind us that Scarpetta is a doctor after all.<br />So, if you are interested in discovering what is all the fuss about Patricia Cornwell, I strongly suggest that you read her first books and leave this one for later if you are still curious.<br />A book zone the Return of the Son of the Mummy.	2001-05-28

I must confess that this book didn't create in me such passionate feelings. This novel, in my opinion, is an above average science-fiction book but doesn't deserve so much praise nor so much hate.<br />Descriptions of the arctic deserts of Gethen and of the different cities of the planet are well written and made me believe in this strange world. If one excepts the special sexual status of its inhabitants and its urban architecture, Gethen is not so strange for the common Earthly reader. That is the reason why we care a lot about the love-friendship story of the two main characters which is the principal plot of the novel. But THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS is way too short in pages and in analysis to be considered as a masterpiece.<br />A book to read. Once.	2001-05-06

Dick in some of his former books : the struggle for power. Each of the main characters of the PENULTIMATE TRUTH symbolizes a political force. Runcible has the power that wealth can give, Stanton Brose can reign thanks to his absolute control over an army of robots, the passive Adams would belong nowadays to a leftist government and, at last, the Cherokee born Lantano does have the paradoxal task to impersonate the fascist political solution.<br />So THE PENULTIMATE TRUTH is more a political book than a science-fiction novel although one can find some good sci-fi ideas in it like for instance the ever changing aspect of Lantano resulting from a default of his time machine. But this idea and a few others are not deeply developed in THE PENULTIMATE TRUTH by Philip K. Dick. One feels that  he was more concerned by the accurate paintings of his political archetypes. There are nonetheless superb moments in this book, in particular the last pages which denounce the manipulations people like you and me must, alas, expect from our authorities.<br />In short, THE PENULTIMATE TRUTH is not an essential book for the common reader but will certainly please Philip K. Dick fans.<br />I liked it.	2001-04-20

Since I'm not particularly good at physics and astral mathematics, I'm ready to believe anything Joe Haldeman wants me to take for granted.<br />So let's admit that extraterrestrials exist and look ugly, let's admit that our military authorities won't become smarter in the centuries to come and that war will become the main interest of our posterity.  In short, THE FOREVER WAR is the story of a soldier of the future. Thanks to the laws of relativity, William Mandella loses - or gains, I'm not totally sure of this - decades of objective time every time he has to fly.<br />THE FOREVER WAR is the kind of book you cannot leave until it is finished. It has suspense, excellent descriptions of the psychology of soldiers - after all, Joe Haldeman was also a member of the U.S. army - and a realistic love story. It's an example of above average science-fiction deserving to stay in your library if you're a fan of this literary genre.<br />A book that could have been a masterpiece.	2001-04-03

Dick published only one novel THE GAME-PLAYERS OF TITAN, a novel you will enjoy very much if you are already familiar with Dick's imaginary world or dislike if it's the first novel of PKD you read. Why ? Because Philip K. Dick, in this novel, was more interested in the psychological torments of THE GAME-PLAYERS OF TITAN's main character - Pete Garden - than in giving a solid literary structure to this novel.<br />In fact, behind every Pete Garden move, you can recognize the shadow of the personal life of PKD. Garden has problems with women, so does PKD, Pete Garden is an expert in pharmacology and drugs, so is PKD. At last, Pete Garden is always oscillating between psychosis and neurosis like Philip K. Dick in the early sixties.<br />The Titan invaders had already been partly described by PKD in 1957, in THE WORLD JONES MADE. Now these creatures rule the Earth and have brought to the few humans left their hobby, the Game. The story is not very interesting but one of the most important themes treated by Philip K. Dick - the Simulacra - makes a famous first apparition in THE GAME-PLAYERS OF TITAN. Are you for real ? Are you what you seem to be ? Am I what I think I am ? Those questions torture the characters of the novel. For our pleasure.<br />A CD to..  No! A DVD for..  NO!! A book for those of you who deserve Philip K. Dick.	2001-03-28

Simmons develops original themes pages after pages and each of the stories of the pilgrims could have been published as an independent novel of its own.<br />Father L&eacute;nar Hoyt's story is the favorite of mine because it's a variation of the main theme of CARRION COMFORT, Dan Simmon's precedent novel. How men can fight evil that is corrupting the soul - in CARRION COMFORT - and the body, in HYPERION. The final of this peculiar story is a very impressive moment, even for the reader used to morbid descriptions.<br />One is a little bit puzzled at the beginning of the book because Dan Simmons, in the first 30 pages, is refering to such characters or places as The Gritch, the Time Tombs, the Extros or the City of the Poets without a single explanation for the reader. Don't give up, these themes will be extremely well developed in the different stories told by the Pilgrims. At the end of the novel, the whole universe conceived by Dan Simmons is literally living in front of our eyes. That's obviously the mark of the great writer. Even in the despised science-fiction literary genre.<br />A book which is already in your library.	2001-03-10

Dick books published in 1960 - the first one being the already forgotten DR. FUTURITY -, can be found in a 1956 novelette presented in Satellite n° 20. Such borrowings were then common, authors developing a novelette to the length of a novel even years after the first publication. A.E. Van Vogt and Isaac Isamov for instance used this innocent literary trick in numerous occasions.<br />VULCAN'S HAMMER reminded me of another PKD novel, also published in 1956, THE WORLD JONES MADE. In the two novels, the established government is threatened by a democratic revolution. Father Fields, the leader of the &quot; Healers &quot;, must fight not only the Nomenklatura of the sole ruling party but also the Vulcan computers to which a trusting world has left years before the entire responsibility in political matters. Soon Vulcan III will defend itself against those who want its death by producing little &quot;hammers&quot; that kill, observe and communicate with a Vulcan deeply hidden in the ground. One could consider these hammers as the first cellulars ever mentioned in a literary text.<br />Some of the novels Philip K. Dick has published in the late fifties-early sixties period stand very well the test of time thanks to the originality of the themes treated - as in EYE IN THE SKY - but others like VULCAN'S HAMMER are very dated. The idea of a fight between computers and humans for supremacy is not, in my opinion, the most original idea found in a sci-fi book.<br />Nevertheless, if you can find a copy of VULCAN'S HAMMER, don't hesitate to buy it because a book that is not read is a dead book and Philip K. Dick deserves to stay alive in our libraries.<br />A book for PKD ultra-fans only.	2001-02-20

It's an unfinished novel that is nonetheless magistral. The novel describes some events that shook the life of the Boiakine family during the 1925-1943 period approximately. This period was marked by the irresistible political rise of Joseph Staline and the first purges organized by the communist party of the late Soviet Union.<br />But these tragic political events are seen through the eyes of members of the Boiakine family, losing all their historical impact but gaining an emotional dimension one would hardly find in socio-political studies. When a friend of the Boiakine family is arrested in the middle of the night, everybody try to remember on which occasion this friend has betrayed the political line of the communist party. Soon even the old 1917 revolutionaries are arrested and Nicolai Grigori&eacute;vitch, the head of the Boiakine family, is beginning to have some doubts about the reality of the guiltiness of his friends.<br />Most of the events described in DISAPPEARANCE are told by Goric, the youngest child of the Boiakine family, from his school days to his arrival in Moscow in the middle of the german invasion. He has a privileged relation with old people who, by explaining to him how was the past, let him have a rather objective opinion about what happens in his life.<br />DISAPPEARANCE has this melancholic tone one admires so much in the russian literature of the XXth century and I strongly recommend this novel to those of you who still believe that russian literature has died with Boulgakov.<br />A book for your library.	2001-02-11

Dick's TIME OUT OF JOINT has greatly inspired the authors of the screenplay of Peter Weir's THE TRUMAN SHOW. Ragle Gumm, the hero of TIME OUT OF JOINT, is questioning the reality he is living in, like in fact the majority of the characters created by Philip K. Dick during his literary career.<br />Ragle Gumm's efforts to discover the &quot;hidden&quot; side of the world he has been thrown into is, in my opinion, the most interesting aspect of the novel. The science-fictional explanation of the reasons why Ragle Gumm has to play everyday is not very convincing and the analysis of the origin of the war between Lunatics and Terrians way too simple for an author such as PKD.<br />However, TIME OUT OF JOINT provides the kind of pleasure the Philip K. Dick fan searches in vain in today sci-fi production. So don't hesitate to add this book to your collection if you are already familiar with the world of this writer.	2001-01-22

Dick's books you should read if you still don't know this american writer. If I'm not mistaken, it was the first time that Philip K. Dick, in a novel, was treating the theme of the virtual realities.<br />Eight persons, while visiting the Bevatron, the only pure science-fiction element of the novel, are trapped in a time hole after having accidentally been hit by the Bevatron ray. They wake up in a world that at first is pretty much the same than the one they have just left but they soon realize that they are caught in a world entirely created by the phantasms of one of them.<br />One can like THE EYE OF THE SKY for numerous good reasons such, for instance, as the slight favour of Agatha Christie's &quot; and then they were none &quot; in it, the reader waiting anxiously for the next imaginary world to appear and the clues that will lead him to the identity of the new dreamer's name. One can also appreciate this book for its critique of the late fifties's american society : The Mc Carthy syndrome, the anti-communism paranoïa or the wave of the evangelism don't have the slightest chance under Philip K.

Dick, the 1955 SOLAR LOTTERY has very well stood the test of time and provides a peculiar pleasure to the sci-fi amateur or the PKD fan. In the mid-fifties, Dick had already written dozens of first rate novelettes and developed a certain number of themes one will encounter in his novels.<br />In the year 2203, a new political philosophy rules the world ; to avoid dictatorship, scientists have proposed that the world leader should be chosen by the hazard. So, an atomic kind of clock moves at random and decides who will be the next master. This ideal form of democracy presents advantages but also danger. The world leader is protected by telepaths whose role is to stop and kill those who want to murder him.<br />The action of SOLAR LOTTERY begins when Reese Verrick, the leader in charge, has just been evicted from his charge by a sudden move of the atomic clock. He wants his job back and sends an android to kill the new Master. This last idea lets Philip K. Dick develop one of his favorite themes ; the android is controlled by a dozen men who enter its mind at random and so are going to fool the poor telepaths. One of SOLAR LOTTERY heroes is Benteley, chosen with a few others to control the android and Dick plays masterfully with objective and subjective points of view when Benteley is &quot;in&quot; or &quot;out&quot; the mind of the android.<br />SOLAR LOTTERY, apart of the pleasure to discover an already great PKD in his first novel, presents accurate theories about politics, morals or sociology. Furthermore, you can also consider the novel as a subtle variation of Isaac Asimov's FONDATION.<br />A book deserving to be rediscovered.	2000-12-30

As often in sci-fi novels written in that period, the danger has come from Asia ; China has attacked and the americans must learn to rebuild by themselves their hyper-technical society. But the atomic war has produced genetical mutations among the humans and the animals and soon the mutants become a danger to the human species.<br />I never had the feeling that DR. BLOODMONEY was a coherent novel, it was rather a collection of several novelettes to me. The story of Hoppy, the phocomel without arms nor legs, developing paranormal powers, the story of Dr. Bluthgeld or Bloodmoney, the paranoid scientist, who thinks that he can destroy his enemies (in fact, everyone) by will alone, the story of Walt Dangerfield who, condemned to live in a satellite, has the responsibility to try to unify a population lost in a no-car world, and so on. Each one of these novelettes is excellent but the novel in itself is not at the level of UBIK or NOW WAIT FOR LAST YEAR.<br />A book for Philip K. Dick's aficionados only.	2000-12-23

Simulacra, schizophreny and autism, time breaches, Dick's favorite themes, become mingled in this nightmarish novel you are going either to reject violently either to be hypnotized by. Because, in 1964, Philip K. Dick, books after books, was creating new standards for modern science-fiction.<br />Philip K. Dick has always read a lot, classic as well as modern literature. He rapidly felt that he had to adapt the classical structure of his first novels to a more deconstructed one in order to be able to treat his main themes like virtual realities or time gaps with the virtuosity we know. Some would say that most of the disturbing descriptions found in MARTIAN TIME-SLIP are the result of both a sick mind and the abuse of illegal substances. Maybe, maybe not. What is sure is that Philip K. Dick has written some of the most innovative pages of the literature of the sixties.<br />The description of the mental universe of Manfred Steiner, the schizophrenic boy, will leave you psychologically exhausted and with the urge to buy the whole literary production of this under-appreciated Master of american science-fiction.<br />A book for your library.	2000-12-03

Dick's books every three or four years in order not to forget what an adult sci-fi book looks like. Of course, one has to be careful because Philip K. Dick, amidst a dozen masterpieces, also wrote a certain number of books to pay his rent, books which could deceive the curious reader.<br />THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE won the 1964 Hugo award and gave to Philip K. Dick the opportunity to write his best novels without being worried by financial problems. It's not my favorite Dick novel but I nevertheless read it on a regular basis because this writer, in my opinion, is one of the most important american writers of the XXth century and each of his books is way better than the 99 % of today sci-fi production.<br />Numerous Dick's obsessions can be found in THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE like his fear in front of any kind of totalitarism or his intimate belief that reality is only a mask hiding another reality which could hide... and so on. His problems with the F.B.I. have also inspired the scenes describing how innocent people are hunted and arrested by members of the german secret police.<br />I should say that THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE is a good introduction to Philip K. Dick's universe for those of you who want to discover this writer. It's adult science-fiction at its best.<br />A book to read again. And again. And again.	2000-11-13
US	52529533	R26Q2ASQPLG83I	067172066X	676031600	The Warrior's Apprentice	Books	4	4	5	N	N	MILES  FROM  HOME	Books after books, Lois McMaster Bujold is creating a unique world involving different planets coping with the same problems than we have today on planet Earth : wars, dictatures and struggles for the power. The inhabitants of Barrayar or Beta are extra-terrestrials but their preoccupations are very earthly so we can identify very easily with the heroes of Mrs Bujold. Even with Miles Vorkosigan and his strange complexion.<br />THE WARRIOR'S APPRENTICE , as in the other books of Mrs Bujold, is more a psychological study than a pure sci-fi book. That's not a critique, in fact I really appreciate this manner to translate in a far future our today problems. The author is obviously talented.<br />Once in a while, it's really a pleasure to read such books as THE WARRIOR'S APPRENTICE. They are not of the serious kind but you never have the feeling to lose your time by reading them. That's a compliment.<br />Recommended.	2000-10-11

According to  this writer, the world is threatened by evil forces hidden to the common  people but well known by the heroes of these novels. The bloody ritual of  the indian goddess, Kali, is one of the roots of the Tree of Evil.<br />The  philosophical theory of Manicheism that presents the world as the gigantic  battlefield between the Forces of Evil and those of the Good is a theory  used, openly or not, by thousands of writers for centuries now. Dan Simmons  adds to this pyramidal construction of books his own personal version by  associating the Forces of Evil with a city : Calcutta.<br />The descriptions  of Calcutta and of its people, strange rites and Kafkaïan administrations  are, as far as I can judge, accurate and are certainly not sponsored by the  Indian Tourist Office. The story is interesting and you won't leave THE  SONG OF KALI before its ending. But there are a lot of weak pages in it ;  characters disappearing and leaving the reader unaware of their destinies,  multiple hesitations between the social thriller and the pure Fantastic  genre, a rather simple explanation of the system of classes and religions  ruling the indian society.<br />So I would recommend THE SONG OF KALI only to  the readers already familiar with the world of Dan Simmons. The other  readers can go directly to CARRION COMFORT.<br />A -stay at home- book.	2000-08-27

It's not a book destined solely to science-fiction aficionados, the  near-future presented being a future that a reader of the year 2000 is able  to accept without an intense intellectual effort. The characters of THE  SPARROW are well developed and one cares about the fears, the hopes and the  disillusions of the passengers of the STELLA MARIS.<br />The structure of the  book is also to be praised ; THE SPARROW is a long confession of a jesuit  priest to his superior, the reader waiting impatiently that Emilio Sandoz  regains enough forces to explain what has happened during his interstellar  trip.<br />One can also appreciate this book for its political study of an  extraterrestrial society or for the subtle analysis of the moral crisis of  a mystic priest. In fact, THE SPARROW is so dense (for a science-fiction  book, I mean) that each one of us will find in it pages that are going to  ravish him. That's the best compliment that I can pay to this novel.	2000-08-02

The sex revolution is over, drugs are part of everyday life and &quot; no taboo &quot; is the motto. Charles Highway, the hero of RACHEL'S PAPERS, is a  child of the sixties who desperately needs something to believe in. His  father cannot give him lessons of ethics and his mother is more interested  in social activities than in the education of Charles.<br />Furthermore, girls  cannot sustain the romantic standards hundreds of writers have described in  thousand of books. Just read the chapter dedicated to Rachel's underwear  and you will understand Charles Highway's trauma.<br />In order to give a  sense to his life, Charles has to get rid of the past. Let's observe the  numerous pages containing descriptions of the butterfly's birth : diarrhea,  gonorrhea and expectorations mark Charles's journey to adulthood.<br />This  powerful first novel of Martin Amis has the flavour of dead flowers and is  an interesting documental book about this period, childhood or the 70's,  that has marked a great number among us.<br />A book for my generation.	2000-07-16
US	52529533	RW0Q63OMSHPBT	0446359203	629572192	Carrion Comfort	Books	4	5	7	N	N	DREAM  DREAM  DREAM...	Everyone has had once this phantasm or dream : to be able to control others to make them do everything we want them to do. This phantasm is generally produced by a sexual pulsion or aggressivity ; who could say that  he hasn't mentally murdered a rather important number of people in his life  ? At least, not I.<br />The heroes of Dan Simmons's CARRION COMFORT do have  this power. And not during their sleep. They really do what you have always  dreamt to do. Without an ounce of shame or guiltiness because it appears  that they haven't read Sigmund Freud's THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS !<br />But  Willy, Nina and Melanie are quickly bored by their first essays and are now  attracted and blinded by the power conferred to them by their gift. Then  begins the Game.<br />The first part of CARRION COMFORT is really scary with  the description of the mind manipulations invented by these new vampires.  The uneasiness you're about to feel is aggravated by the fact that Dan  Simmons chose to present, every 50 pages, the point of view of Melanie, one  of the actors of the game. Through these pages, you will feel like entering  the mind of a psychopath ; every murder committed by the old lady is  justified by numerous reasons Melanie exposes patiently to the hypnotized  reader. Soon, you are going to pray for the chapter to end so that you can  return to the objective point of view of the good heroes of CARRION  COMFORT.<br />The second part of the book was, in my opinion, not at the level  of the first part, Dan Simmons using too many pages to give scientific  explanations in order to give CARRION COMFORT the status of a violent  thriller rather than a fantastic book.<br />Anyway, I warmly recommend this  900 pages production.	2000-06-17
US	52529533	RX4FI9ARYAIF9	0449002632	479109259	London: The Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	GENERATIONS	I didn't know Edward Rutherfurd before buying LONDON. I was attracted by the subject - a city, heroine of a novel - and by the desire to learn something without being bored by another historical book I would surely  abandon in my library after the first 50 pages.<br />And I've certainly  learned something. Now I have a notion a little bit more accurate of what  is hidden behind such great names as TUDORS, STUARTS or PLANTAGENETS. It  has been such an interesting experience that I've already bought RUSSKA  !<br />Of course, it's not literature at its best, one often feels that the  little stories invented by Rutherfurd are no more than a - good - pretext  to present to the reader an historical fact and that they could have been  more profound.<br />In short, I don't regret the numerous hours dedicated to  LONDON.	2000-05-19
