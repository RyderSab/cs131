This book is great. It tells me everything I need to know.<br />I recommend this book more for a reference book rather then a tutorial or guide on learning WebLogic chapter by chapter.	2004-01-24
US	52037794	R3XIUVK0XGZV8	0072465638	829422216	Database Management Systems, 3rd Edition	Books	5	2	6	N	N	Great Book	I just stumbled across this on Amazon. Thinking back to my undergrad days - I used a earlier edition (1998-9) of this book. It was a ABSOLUTELY great book. Even when I took a graduate level class in Database systems, I saw myself flipping back to this book very often. <br />I am definitely going to buy this edition, as I lost my old copy. It will serve as a good reference book even as you prepare for interviews or actually use databases in your job. Key definitions and concepts are well explained. I recommend marking them, so that it is easy to refer back as you see yourself getting rusty with them, over the years.<br />Absolutely the highest recommended database book! <br />The only gotcha on this book is the price. I wish it was 20-30 bucks cheaper :(.. regardless it is well worth the high sticker price.	2003-10-02

It does an excellent job on covering the WebLogic Server, but not these other components. It also doesn't really cover Liquid Data or JRockit.<br />Is this then truly a &quot;platform book&quot; ? Seems to be better titled as &quot;WebLogic Server&quot;. I must say though that it does a good job at what it does cover, and thus the 3 stars.	2003-09-09

It covers all the nitty-gritty in configuring the WLS Server - and all the different options such as clustering, security, failover, etc. <br />It absolutely does not talk about development. So if you are a pure developer then don't buy the book, because you will not benefit much.<br />I give it 3 stars only, because I think it is good, but not perfect. There are better ways to explain tough concepts such as clustering.	2003-04-12

It covers the practical issues of developing Web Services, through the age old patterns approach. Paul Monday takes the standard Gang of Four and J2EE Design Patterns and shows developers and architects how these patterns would be applied in a Web Services world.<br />The book is targeted at developers and architects who have alreadt have a solid understanding of Web Services and Design Patterns. <br />The code samples are based on Apache Axis and work great. I strongly recommend that you go through them in detail to get full value from this book.	2003-04-08

Dude this book was not to make you a master at EJBs. The book meets its purpose quite well. It gives you a good rundown on how to get started with Weblogic 7.0 and points you to material (such as the BEA docs) for in depth stuff on advanced topics.<br />This is a good beginners guide. It is not, and not intended to be an advanced guide. Look at the BEA Weblogic 7.0 Bible for advanced stuff (coming out soon). You can look at the 6.1 Bible in the mean time.	2003-01-06

Very detailed and explanatory	A lot of public review work went into writing this book. Even though this book will be available as a freely downloadable PDF, it is recommended that you buy it - in support of all the work that went in. <br />It details a lot that you thought you new about EJBs, and don't. Also watch for the EJB Design Patterns book, to supplement this. This book also has some good examples and best practices. It comes with a EJB poster, that is quite impressive.<br />It is absolutely a must have for any EJB 2.0 Developer/Architect and a great treat to start the new year.	2002-01-02

The Case Study at the end of the book is very detailed and by following through it, you can gain a solid understanding of SOAP, XML and how to use it.<br />The only drawback is that it doesn't describe in detail the use of SOAP by multiple programming languages.

Clever use of &lt;B&gt;bold&lt;/B&gt; text formatting and a terse set of symbols  representing modifiers and OO concepts make this a very &quot;dense&quot;  reference in a relatively small volume. <br />The printing and paper quality  is good too.

Detailed explanation of various algorithms. Uses a fictional MIX assembly language machine to show code examples. This is unusual, but turned about to be very very helpful. The excerises at the end are have a rating of how difficult they are to solve, so you can choose which ones u want to tackle.

I am graduate  student in Computer Science and a E-Commerce Consultant by profession. This  book is more detailed than the Sedweick (I can't spell his name) in the  sense that it has some more of a mathematical approach. It lacks the level  of explanation that the Sedweick book provided. It has some math, but  overlooks some steps thus targeting someone with a pretty solid math  background, not someone with sophomore level undergraduate math background.  <br />Overall.. if you're a student taking an algorithms or advanced  algorithms class (especially a graduate class), you might want to invest in  this book.	2000-03-30
