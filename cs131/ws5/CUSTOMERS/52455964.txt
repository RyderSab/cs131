The biggest advantage to his book is that it concisely draws together the general facts about stars, planets, and atmospheres that one needs to design the physicality of worlds for hard-science fiction. Though not all encompassing or exhaustive of the subject, there's enough data to enable one to make choices for a world and then research those choices to the depth necessary to meet one's needs without having to become an expert in astrophysics and/or biochemistry.	2004-07-05

This is probably one of the most enlightening and honest books on adolescent sexuality to be released in decades, and any loving parent should read it. The author relies on facts and research to dispel the currently trendy bogeymen too often encountered today as a tool of the puritanical minded in the USA. It will without question be unjustifiably vilified by the Religious Right for this.	2003-09-19

The first was that the author honestly & truthfully deals with his grief as an extremely personal & individualized experience - the anguish, the depression, the ache, the doubt, the inconsistency; the unwanted & unhelpful push by society, friends, religion which really want us to not remind them of grief; the moments of relief, forgetfulness & grace, etc. The second was that, in his honesty, I was found a very many of passages which echoed exactly my own grief even though the author lost his long-time friend, lover & wife but I lost my friend, gay lover, soul- & life-mate.	2003-03-23

While an interesting read to anyone familar with sadomasochism from the inside, this book realy offers more to those who are curious from either a psychological or a sexual interest. Far from being scary or unrealistic fantasy, it's frank and honest about a subject still too often considered taboo by a part of &quot;polite&quot; society which then goes on to ineptly try to practice it.	2001-10-26

If you are seeking a prettied-up Bunnies&amp;Light approach with Victorian gossimer-winged creatures, you'll be disappointed with this book; but if you are seeking really practical &amp; usable information which you can apply within your own prafctice, this is one of the best books currently available on Faerie.

The known characters are true to their natures as presented in TNG, and the story itself is far more interesting than some of the others under the TNG moniker. There are few mistakes re: our current understanding of physics, but then the entire StarTrek genre is rife with such things. A few reviewers have pointed out the naivete of some Sec. 31 officers, but to my mind, this happens in any such groups when they occassionally become a bit too self assured &amp; cocky.<br />One reason I picked up this specific book was because of the outlandish homophobic comments made by a minority of reviewers (one of whom read less than 40 pages) - I'm always intrigued when a reviewer focuses one only one minor aspect of a book for his/her post. Frankly, if you think this is a work of Gay fiction, you'll be disappointed: the 2 Gay characters are no more Gay than Julian &amp; Neils (surely I'm not the only one who noticed the amount of quality time they spent together on Deep Space Nine or the near-tearful goodbyes they exchanged at the end of the series). As for TNG not dealing with Gays, the original discussions of the series implied that they did intend to do so (but the station soon capped that); in fact, in the first season, if you watch carefully, a crewMAN occassionally appears in the background wearing a dress (yeah, I know, a stereotype, but that's TV for you).<br />As for the author having an agenda, the only agenda I've seen is totally in the mind of a couple of reviewers.	2001-07-15

This book is an interesting study of the structure of Hixkaryana, one of the extremely rare OVS (object-verb-subject) languages. The author covers the inflectional and derivational morphologies of noun, verb, adverb and adjective forms; phenomena particular to discourse; and correlations and major differences between Hixkaryana and the typology of SVO, SOV and VSO languages, along with providing many examples of different types of clauses and compound sentences. The reader will benefit from either an understanding of, or access to, a book explaining some of the less often encountered symbols used in phonology.	2001-01-30

Far too many pages are devoted to trying to prove that Nordic (or Asatru) &amp; Finnish are closely related due to archetype-overlap (Ukko &amp; Odin), and far too few are devoted to the qualities of Finnish magic which would make its practice unique. The suggested trancing methods in the book, while viable, are associated with Finnish belief by weak inference rather than by historical precedence. The suggestions on how to pronounce Finnish words are grossly inaccurate &amp; inadequate.	2000-12-11

Considering  the reference to &quot;a sometimes hostile world&quot; in the book's  subtitle, one is unprepared for the author's hostility toward others'  traditions.<br />That said, the book is well-written by an articulate author,  and is still worth a read by mature Pagans who are able to ignore  unnecessarily inflammatory material: it offers a brief reminder of the  origins of NeoPaganism  and of the pervasive influences of JudeoChristian  thought within it; and pulls together some helpful concepts which  here-to-fore were scattered across different philosophies (e.g. that  everyone is ultimately responsible for his/her own behavior, that strength  comes from knowing who we are, that every attendant at a ritual should  participate fully in that ritual regardless of gender or sexual preference,  that male mysteries are best learned from men just as female mysteries are  best learned from women, that at heart of NeoPaganism lies not just the  quest but also questioning and reasoning).	2000-06-12
