I first heard of Dr.Porter through Positive Changes Hypnosis, and I picked up his book. It was wonderful. Dr.Porter and his wife use stories to convey different ideas. I've read it to my kids and they love it too, although some of the concepts are a bit much for them. Definetly recommended!	2003-04-24

But i found myself presently surprized at this book which is actually a book of shadows. if you like scott cunningham, and i am hard pressed to find any wiccan who doesn't, youw ill find this to be a valuable resource. If you just watch the show for the heck of it. this will enlighten you to the reality of wicca, which is something i wish i could do more, either way, wiccan or not, there is stuff about charmed all the way through, and you'll learn a lot about the most controversial part of the fastest growing religion in america also, magick. Definetly reccomended.	2003-02-20

I love this book, yes, as a Wiccan, there are not a lot of books written about the God, but there are some, and this is by far the best. It has stories, tells you whos who and what's what. if you are a Wiccan, you need this book. Yes, I came into the Craft because the Goddess spoke to me as a woman, but the God has been masked and his many guises denied or branded evil. This book sets it straight. Please get your hands on a copy if you are Wiccan or wish to adore the many faces of God.	2003-02-12

Wicca is not ancient, it is 50 years old, and this is book is based on teachings from the man who introduced the religion to the world. if you want a look at how the origional Wiccans did it, buy this book. I value it, but it is an intense peice of work. Definetly worth owning for any serious student or practitioner of Wicca.	2003-02-12

No matter how many villans he kills, no matter how dead he is, he is not dead from his pain. I dont' have the book in fromt of me currently but here's a quote as best I can remember it:<br />\\"Eric screams and pounds his head against the wall as the phantom fire truck paces across his vision, all he wants is pain, pain and hate. Yes, hate, but never ever fear, fear is for the enemy, fear and bullets.\\"<br />I loved this comic, it got me though some hard times in life. It;'s an amazing story of life and loss, but it's not all lessons and appriciating life. Deep down all eric wants is death.<br />Blessed be	2002-09-23

I own this book. But I have to say that reading it left me feeling disenchanted. I have read many books by male wiccan authors and none of them have ever come close to the sexism that I encountered in this book. I am a woman, and i was offended. My boyfriend is pagan, I have more male pagan friends than female ones, (which I realize is unusual.) This book makes me sad because I, personally, have seen more men passionatly dedicated to the Goddess than women. This book, and ones like it, made a few of my pagan friends just not want to be pagan anymore. They said that they felt there was no room for them in Goddess religions. It's on my shelf, but it will never have a place in my heart.	2001-10-31

I love this book. It is mostly a big dictionary with the magickal properties of different plants, but in addition to this, the first 22 pages is an introduction to the art. It talks about what a magickal herbalist is, The use of timing (if you choose), tools, visualization, an altar, ect. It also has &quot;spells and procedures&quot; which includes enchanting the herbs, making satchets, infusions, baths, teas, ect. I was over all very impressed with the entire book. Also included is the folk names of many herbs, (adder's fork, wool of bat, ect.) It was all very interesting and put into an easy to read format.	2001-08-17

I have been looking for a book on handfastings since I discovered the religion of wicca. I finally found one, and I was pretty impressed with the information and ideas given in it. The only problem is, becaus i have read so little ont eh subject, I have no idea how well researched this book is. But all in all it has excellent ideas and it shows that there are different degrees of handfastings. A simple handfasting, for example, can be as long or as short a commitment as two  people want, whereas the more &quot;serious&quot; handfastings are &quot;as long as the love shall last&quot;. Her opinions can help you form your own but remember, as she says, IT IS YOUR HANDFASTING, no one should be able to tell you what you can and cannot do in your own ritual of love.	2001-08-09

Much like people's reactions to he film &quot;The Craft,&quot; you have to take this for what it is, fiction. Parts of it actually DO focus on teachings of wicca, but like Nancy's role in &quot;The Craft,&quot; it shows how the main chericter, Bethany, gets so angry that she is willing to mistrust and manipulate the people that she should trust most- Her coven. I think that the outcome should have been that there was a horrible accident, and bethany realized it, the way the book ended didn't do the book justice. It made it seem like using Wicca for negative, selfish ways was o.k. But overall it was a good read.	2001-01-09
