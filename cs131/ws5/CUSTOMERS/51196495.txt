US	51196495	R3MZBBRASSITJZ	0801491304	196566281	The Complete Poems of Stephen Crane	Books	5	6	6	N	Y	for lovers of poetry, old or modern	this collection of crane's complete poetry is divided into four sections. the two most important sections are the two volumes of poetry crane published, which were -the black riders and other lines- and -war is kind-. the third section consists of &quot;uncollected poems&quot;, i.e. poems that were published in magazines but did not appear in the two collections, and posthumously published poems. <br />as the other reviewers have stated, crane was not and is not known for his poetry, but it is quite magnificent. in general his poetry is surprisingly modern. they tend to be more prose-oriented although he often uses literal or loosely repeated sections (i.e. refrains) to good effect. his poetry also tends to be didactic (often taking the form of a parable with such &quot;characters&quot; as mountains, angels, and philosophers), morbid, and direct. which is certainly not to say that they aren't also emotional, masterful, and engaging.<br />-the black riders- as a whole is more straightforward than the poems in -war is kind-. in general the poems in -black riders- center around the metaphysical, with themes such as religion, ethics, and philosphy appearing often. although -war is kind- contains many of the same themes, it also includes more concrete themes, such as war, the many facets of a man's relationship with a woman, and specific occurrences and objects such as the printing of newspapers. the uncollected and posthumous poetry is varied, but just as excellent if not better than the poems in the two collections.<br />this edition is quite attractive, a nice size with a mostly competent introductory essay that sheds light on the background of the publishing of crane's two collections. the print itself is generally clean and attractive, although occasionally there are some notable flaws in the printing where a line is too dark or too light. all in all, though, this collection is highly recommended as it is complete and crane's poetry is well worth reading and timelessly relevant.	2003-11-20

US	51196495	R1T1RDUW9FOS38	0793572290	777194814	Rent: Vocal Selections	Books	4	40	41	N	N	generally good, although not complete	The selections in this collection match the selections featured on the RENT - selections album. Unfortunately, this means that many of the best songs in the full score are cut out (including: Light my Candle, La Vie Boheme... I Should Tell You, etc.), because they involve sung dialogue rather than &quot;liftable&quot; songs (songs that work out of context). Another drawback is that in general, songs written for a rock band (featuring extensive guitar) do not transcribe well to solo piano (guitar chords are included in this book, though). With this in mind, however, there is still a lot of good things about this collection. Larson's great ballad-esque songs, like &quot;I'll cover you,&quot; &quot;Your eyes,&quot; &quot;Without You,&quot; and &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; work very well as piano/vocal. Other, more rock-sounding songs such as &quot;Rent,&quot; &quot;Out tonight,&quot; and &quot;What you own&quot; are still doable. As written they may sound a little awkward, but people who have had experience playing rock piano may find that with a little fiddling with the written notes a decent version can be produced. Even if you don't have experience playing rock piano, if you have more experience playing other Broadway music you can still learn a lot from working with these songs and trying out different things. Other songs included are: &quot;Take me or Leave me,&quot; &quot;Another Day,&quot; &quot;Halloween,&quot; and &quot;Santa Fe.&quot; &quot;Take me&quot; didn't transcribe well (esp. the vocal line) due to the bluesy pitches of the song, but the main riff and the chords are accurate. &quot;Another day&quot; contains both the rock elements and the balladesque elements, but the rock elements do not require many changes.&quot;Halloween&quot; transcribes faithfully and works well; &quot;Santa Fe&quot; is transcribed well, but since much of it is spoken it is also a little odd. Overall this book is well done. The songs are all faithful in spirit to the album, although at times a pitch is written differently from the orig. broadway cast recording. The song where this is most apparent is in &quot;Seasons of Love&quot; where it appears that the two soloists' lines were mostly improvised. Although I usually prefer for a song's accompaniment to reflect the actual full score, in the case of these songs such accompaniment is repetitive and adding the vocal line (which is actually a very standard practice for vocal selections) was very welcome. RENT has become a part of the modern musical theater canon, and so this book has become necessary for any Broadway-lover's sheet music collection.	2003-08-18

(by basic patterns i mean the few rows or stitches that provide the repeating pattern for a full piece.) it's great that there are so many basic patterns, but there are only about 25 actual full patterns. it would've been nice if they had put together some sort of template for making, say a sweater or a hat, w/ some of the basic patterns, instead of just providing a few examples of a hat or sweater and expecting you to be able to come up w/ the correct way to adapt the basic pattern for the piece you want to make.  still it's a very informative book, w/ loads of extra info like the history of crocheting, diff. types of yarns, crocheting w/ wire, and a veritable cornucopia of pictures and diagrams.	2003-03-07

It's a great improvement on the poor job that was done on the Hello Again book and includes the great songs  &quot;Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Way Back to Paradise&quot;, and &quot;I Don't  Hear the Ocean&quot; in generally ideal piano/voice arrangements. It also  includes some versions of songs which are different from the original cast  recording of the show, which leads me to wonder what the extent of the  music not included on the album was and whether or not some of the  selections date back to before the final version of the show was made. The  most notable of these songs is one called &quot;The Adventure Never  Ends&quot; (a song which includes the music titled &quot;The Storm&quot; on  the cast album along with an entire section of music I'd never heard before  and is interesting although not particularly moving) which is lumped  together with the songs &quot;Nothing Beats Chicago&quot;, &quot;Ocean is  Different&quot;, and &quot;Danced with a Girl&quot; under the title  &quot;Dante&quot; (a puzzling conglomeration, but perhaps an earlier  version of the show had these songs together). Likewise puzzling is the  segue from &quot;The Scorpion&quot; (a song the folio could have done well  without, likewise the long-winded &quot;Cincinatti&quot;) into a duet  version of the lovely &quot;I Will Love You&quot;. &quot;No Turning  Back&quot;  another selection that is fairly uninteresting, and the  haunting, harrowing &quot;Tell Me&quot; round out the book. The latter is  notable because so many of the notes are different than the ones Audra  McDonald sings on the recording, making me wonder if the notes were changed  later because they are so different that they seem more than just an  artist's liberties. Also, although there are a good number of songs, it's a  pity that some superior songs were not included such as &quot;Miracles and  Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Paradise is Burning Down&quot;, and &quot;Prison in  a Prison.&quot; All in all this is definitely worth getting since the  actual score is unavailable.	2000-06-15
