Rollo and Juliet Forever by Margery Weinman Sharmat with brilliant pastel pictures by Marylin Hafner was one of my all time favorite books when I was little.  In this book Rollo and Juliet Cats played tag together, skipped  rope together and were always nice to each other.  Until one day, when  Rollo forgot to come to Juliet's house, Juliet got mad at him and threw  tomato juice on him.  Rollo didn't like it a bit.  So he threw buttermilk  on Juliet.  From that day on they hated each other.  At long last they made  up.  So far they had only 34 fights but they made up every time.  I loved  the page with Rollo and Juliet at the beach.  I even brought this book in  for show and tell in the second grade.  My teacher still remembers and  loves it.  She is on my back to get her a copy for her class, and I am now  18 years 3 months and still read the book often.  Please encourage the  publisher to Bring it Back.  The lessons it teaches are sorely needed in  todays hateful society.  Through it's pages children who can't even walk  yet can walk into a much better world.	1999-12-10

There are other fine books by her, but this is certainly the best.  This book talks about all the things that you would find around a big city, especially New York.  There are 27 poems  including a parody on East Side West Side.  Then they talk about different  things from A to Z that you would see especially around a big city.  For  Example E is for Escalator, and S is for Subway.  We checked it out of the  library and really thought of not returning it but just paying for the  book, but we didn't want to deny other children the joy of reading it.  We  just got back from New York City, and recited most of the book to them.   We're going to try to get it with your search, but we don't think you will  ever find a good copy.  Most of them are probably falling apart from so  much love and use.  Please encourage the publisher to reprint it.  The  lessons it teaches are desperately needed in todays violent society.   Through the pages children can visit a much better place.	1999-12-06

Richard Scarry's Busy Busy World was one of my favorite books when I was little.  My whole family loved it and we still quote it all the time.

I highlited them in my copy.  Back to  basics, this magical book is about occupations of animal charachters from  all over the globe.  Children can learn wonderful things from the book.   But it never has to seem like learning, that's part of the magic.  As you  read, you will probably feel like you are part of the book yourself.  I  felt that way too.  I bought two copies of Busy, Busy World the last time  it was in Print, and gave them as gifts to friends who were having  children.  I'd buy another million today.

This is one of my favorite children's books to read aloud to the preschool lab at My High School.  The children love it so much and have begged me to read it again and again.  There are other great Silverstein Books, but this  is certainly one of the best.   My friend Miss Elliott, hates this book  because she feels that the boy took everything from the tree to be selfish.   She has dubbed it &quot;The Taking Boy.&quot;  I totally disagree with her  because the tree was happy to give.  When the boy wants money, the tree  gave him her apples to sell in the city for a living.  When the boy needs a  house, the tree gave him her branches to build one with.  Although a tree  can't live without her branches, a person can't live very easily without a  house.  Even after the tree is nothing but a dead stump, she tells the boy  to sit on her when he is tired.  I am writing this review in memory of Shel  Silverstein, who was just as generous as the tree itself.	1999-10-17

Jack Prelutsky did a good job of it.  Even though the book is about as long as a novel, my baby cousin (now nine and a half) sat through the whole book. When she got up to  Anna Banana, she would hold her hands up in the air like she was walking on  them.  The poems, (some based on familiar nursery rhymes) others totally  original, are still staples around our household.  I would reccomend it to  any child. --Robert Metz	1999-08-20

It has been almost six months since our High School Business Teacher, Mrs June Wang passed away.  When she died, I found a copy of &quot;When Dinosaurs Die&quot; at a bookstore and donated it to the school library in  memory of her.  It was such a good book that it made the librarian cry.  It  has episodes in it like, What does Alive Mean,  and What does Dead mean,  and What Comes after death. My favorite book was when a little girl was  getting her pet hamster ready to be buried and her brother took a piece of  lettuce and said, &quot;Here's a snack in case she gets hungry.&quot; And  the mother said, &quot;Sweetheart dead hamsters don't get hungry.&quot;   That reminds me of when the egyptians put food in the pyramids for the  mummies, for their life after death.
