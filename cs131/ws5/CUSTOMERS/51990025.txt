A wonderful book could be written around that idea, each chapter tracing the impact of a different movie.  _Movies That Changed Us_ is, unfortunately, not that book.<br /><br />Clooney's grasp of historical context--or, to be charitable, his presentation of it--is too narrow and too shallow to do justice to the points he's trying to make.  If you're going to make the case that a movie \\"changed us\\" you have to be able to draw the Before and After pictures in convincing detail.  You also have to be able to show that  the movie itself was a catalyst for change . . . not just an indicator of larger forces that actually brought the change about.  Clooney (especially when writing about changes outside of the movie business) frequently fails to do this,<br /><br />The chapter on _The Graduate_ suggests that Clooney recognizes this problem.  He argues that the movie (with its jaded view of romance, sex, marriage, and social norms) \\"killed the romantic comedy.\\"  It's an interesting argument, but what if the same shift in attitude that made _The Graduate_ incomprehensible to the middle-aged parents of 1967 made the romantic comedies of the 1930s, 40s, and 50s incomprehensible to their kids?  Clooney never even considers the possibility.<br /><br />The same problem sinks the chapter on _The Big Parade_, one of a cluster of films from the twenties and early thirties that painted war as bleak, unheroic, and tragic.  Clooney credits such films with making the West slow to move against Hitler . . . but couldn't the too-fresh memories of 10 million young lives lost in a pointless war have been behind *both* the films and the hesitancy to go to war again?  Clooney never stops to ask.<br /><br />The book also suffers from sins of omission: Connections that seem so obvious and important you can't imagine why Clooney doesn't mention them.  Why argue that the \\"Omaha Beach\\" scene in _Saving Private Ryan_ is powerful because of its realism, and *not* contrast it with the far more \\"Hollywood\\" battle scenes later in the picture?  Why spend a chapter on the 1964 anti-war movie_Dr. Strangelove_ and not connect it to the nuclear-disarmarment movement that had been gaining strength since 1946?  Why write about the impact of _Star Wars_ and talk only about computer-controlled cameras . . . not the \\"summer blockbuster\\" category that it (and _Jaws_) more or less created?<br /><br />I study and write about popular culture for a living, but when I bought this book I *wasn't* expecting a scholarly tome.

The story she tells will be old news to anyone who's spent much time in with their back to a chalkboard, but it will be new to manyu who aren't teachers, and deserves to be read widely.  If your reaction to the publisher's blurb was something like: \\"Good grief!  I had no idea!\\" then add another star to my rating.<br /><br /> If your response to the blurb is something along the lines of \\"So what else is new?\\" then subtract a star from my rating, since you may well share my frustrations . . .<br /><br />The book is frustrating because Ravitch, squaring off against a complex problem that demands careful analysis, chooses to wield a sledgehammer instead than a scalpel.  Her basic position seems to be that *all* attempts to regulate the language used in textbooks (however well-intentioned) are inherently misguided.  She appears to resent the banning of \\"lumberjack\\" (which most people, me included, would regard as silly) with the banning of words like \\"cripple,\\" and \\"retard\\" (which most people, me included, would regard as progress).  The list of \\"banned words and phrases\\" she reprints as an appendix is bloated with outdated, gender-specific terms like \\"authoress\\" and \\"aviatrix,\\" \\"coed\\" and \\"spinster\\" that no modern writer would use in the first place and epithets (\\"biddy,\\" \\"codger\\") that you'd probably object to if some stranger applied them to your favorite relative.<br /><br />It is also frustrating because Ravitch, in reviewing history textbooks, seems determined to do so from the narrowest possible perspective.  Why, she repeatedly asks, do American history textbooks insist on recounting the pre-1500 achivements of Africans and Native Americans, but not those of Europeans?  Most practicing historians would see the answer as obvious: Most Americans *know* that the Europeans were civilized by 1500, but many still cling to 19th century image of Africans and Native Americans as backward \\"savages\\" who were \\"uplifted\\" by contact with Europeans.  The same blindness extends to individual matters of fact.  She pooh-poohs textbook claims that the Anasazi had neither chiefs nor kings, yet undertook impressive ciivl engineering projects.  \\"How could they?\\", she asks, overlooking the fact that 19th century Shaker communities were both technologically sophisticated *and* nonhierarchical.  \\"How do we know about their social structure without written records?\\", she asks, overlooking the fact that archaeologists routinely infer social structures from material traces like exotic grave goods and monuments (or the lack of them).<br /><br />Finally, it is frustrating because her suggestions for reform often seem divorced from reality.  If every school district chose its own textbooks (as she recommends) would not the publishers *still* seek to produce a few one-size-fits-all, least-common-denominator products in each field (in order to lower production and marketing costs)?  If every history teacher *did* choose to use two textbooks with divergent perspectives on the facts, who would keep the outraged parents--shrieking about \\"deconstructionism\\" and \\"relativism\\"--off their backs?  She attacks Paul Boyer and other historians for quoting \\"anonymous sources\\" (\\"a farmer said . . .\\") in textbooks.  What would students gain from knowing that the farmer's name was John Smith?  She approvingly quotes Nat Hentoff (whom I normally admire) when he says that \\"Any writer who tailors his prose to someone else's guidelines belongs in advertising.\\"  Fine rhetoric, but a bit of a shock to journalists and scholars who keep the _AP Stylebook_ or the _MLA Manual of Style_ next to their keyboards.<br /><br />The tragedy of Ravitch's book is that all this nonsense gets in theway of a powerful and important argument: The best way to get students excited is *not* to feed them solely on the intellectual equivalent of thin gruel, but to lay out a banquet of all the varied tastes and textures that exist on the printed page.ense gets in the way of a powerful and important argument: The best way to get students excited is *not* to feed them solely on the intellectual equivalent of thin gruel, but to lay out a banquet of all the varied tastes and textures that exist on the printed page. <br />	2005-07-28

Each sketch includes a clear, non-technical description of what the weapon does and an explanation of its tactical impact, the latter illustrated by an account of the weapon in action.  The fifty entries each stand on their own, but the book as a whole--read from cover to cover--is a good introductory survey of the history of weaponry.<br /><br />Weir has, with this single book, met two important needs.  It is the first introduction to this subject aimed at general readers rather than military professionals, historians, or \\"war buffs.\\"  It is also the first introductory book to attend to hard-to-research topics like the history of land mines, smokeless powder, and recoilless artillery.  The book deserves--for these reasons--wide attention from school, college, and public librarians.  It is a crucial stepping-stone to more sophisticated works like Robert O'Connell's _Arms and Men_, William McNeill's _The Pursuit of Power_, and Martin van Creveld's _Technology and War_.<br /><br />Two persistent flaws diminish the book's value somewhat.  The first is atrocious copyediting.  \\"Theodolite\\" (a surveyor's tool) is rendered as \\"the odolite,\\" the Japanese \\"supercarrier\\" Shinano is referred to three times in two pages as \\"Sinano,\\" and a British soldier is described as being \\"invalidated\\" (rather than \\"invalided\\") out of the army as a result of his injuries.  The second, more serious flaw is the near-total absence of line drawings that would reinforce the text by illustrating *how* specific weapons (or the tactics they spawned) work.  Illustrations abound, but they generally add more atmosphere than enlightenment.<br /><br />If introductory books on the history of weaponry were more numerous, these flaws woudl be more serious.

Epstein has also watched the publishing industry change radically since he entered it in 1950, and thought deeply about it.  A book-length discussion of those changes would also make interesting reading.<br /><br />_Book Business_ reads like condensed versions of both those books, inexpertly woven together.  It jumps frequently and (it seems to me) awkwardly from big-picture analysis to \\"there I was having drinks with Nabokov\\" anecdotes.  Ultimately, neither half of the story is entirely satisfying.<br /><br />The business analysis is interesting as far as it goes, but too narrow.  Epstein dismisses all of popular fiction in a sentence as \\"formulaic melodrama,\\" and (aside from literary criticism) barely mentions serious non-fiction at all.  He seems to make no distinction between \\"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\\" and Harlequin Romances, or between David McCullough's \\"John Adams\\" and the latest diet book.  His ideas about the future role of the internet in publishing are equally narrow.  He spends pages explaining (in 2001!) why Amazon.com can't possibly succeed.  His enthusiasm for print-on-demand \\"book vending machines\\" is infectious . . . but takes little account of the staggering mechanical (not electronic) challenges they would present.<br /><br />The literary-memoir side of the book also feels curiously shallow.  The anecdotes about Nabokov, Edmund Wilson, and the like are fascinating, but the sum of them feels like an after-dinner speech on \\"Great Authors I Have Known\\" rather than a discussion of what it's like to edit great writers.  The stories from Epstein's career are also great reading, but they are so obviously *just* the high points that they give little sense of the texture of his career as a whole.  Did he *never*, in fifty years in the business, suffer a setback?<br /><br />There's much here that's interesting, and Epstein is a graceful writer, but I think in the end I'd have rather read the two separate, longer books he might have written.much here that's interesting, and Epstein is a graceful writer, but I think in the end I'd have rather read the two separate, longer books he might have written.	2005-03-06

He spends a lifetime trying to find out, and _Paradise_ tells the story of that search . . . partly through Breen's eyes and partly through the eyes of the people he interviews.<br /><br />That *sounds* like an less-than-exciting basis for a story, but Resnick (possibly the most underrated science fiction writer working today) makes it absolutely gripping. Matthew Breen is a rather bland hero, and there's almost no action (or even overt conflict) in the present-day story, but it doesn't matter. The supporting characters are fascinating and, without exception, more complex than they seem at first. Peponi is beautifully described, and by the time the book is over you find yourself with the same affection for it that the characters have. Above all, there is the puzzle of Peponi's slow decline: a puzzle that Resnick resolves elegantly in the final chapter.<br /><br />Stories about Galactic Empires are a dime-a-dozen in science fiction, but this is different than most. The first reason is that it focuses on a single planet--one small corner of an empire that includes thousands of worlds. The second reason is that Resnick knows a lot about empire-building on *our* world, and uses that history to keep the story of Peponi \\"real.\\" _Paradise_ is, as a result, full of characters who are neither Good Guys or Bad Guys, and driven by complex problems that don't have simple solutions.<br /><br />Highly recommended for science-fiction fans who like to think while they're being entertained.	2005-03-02

One is a comprehensive production history of \\"Space 1999\\" and a detailed guide to its 48 episodes.  The other is a passionate defense of the series as an influential, high-quality landmark in the history of televised science fiction.  Readers who are fans of the series will welcome both elements of the book, as other reviews on this page make clear.<br /><br />Readers with a deep interest in science fiction but no special love for \\"Space 1999\\" will also  find Muir's history and episode guide invaluable but will likely find his argument unpersuasive.  A lifelong reader and viewer of SF who also writes about it professionally, I fall firmly into this latter category.  Here's why:<br /><br />1) Determined to rehabilitate a series he clearly loves after a quarter-century of savage reviews, Muir overreaches.  He argues, for example, that viewers of \\"Thunderbirds\\" (an earlier series by the same creative team) could almost forget that they were watching puppets rather than live actors.  Even the biggest fan of the earlier series would find this hard to credit.  Elsewhere, Muir reverently describes guest stars Brian Blessed, Roy Dotrice, Ian McShane, and Julian Glover (among others) as \\"famous actors\\" . . . as if they were the likes of Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud rather than established character actors who did such work routinely.<br /><br />2) Assessing the contributions of \\"Space: 1999\\" to the development of televised science fiction, Muir falls into the \\"after X . . . therefore because of X\\" trap far too readily.  He implies, time and again, that this or that element of later series such as \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" and \\"Babylon 5\\" must have been inspired by similar elements in \\"Space 1999\\" simply because they came later.  He is doubtless right about some of them, but never seems to consider the possibility that (for example) the presence of a shape-shifting alien in both \\"Space: 1999\\" and \\"Star Trek: Deep Space 9\\" is simply the result of *both* series drawing on an established science fiction plot device (see, for example, John W. Campbell's story \\"Who Goes There?\\" from 1939).<br /><br />3) Muir fails to come to grips with the series' most frequently cited flaws.  His treatment of its scientific errors is typical.  The concept of \\"Space: 1999\\" depends on the Moon breaking loose from its orbit (propelled by an exploding nuclear waste dump on the far side) and hurtling though space fast enough to encounter a dozens of other planetary systems in 5 or 6 years of story time.  This is purest nonsense, but Muir is undaunted.  Faced with a widespread consensus that his beloved series rests on bogus science he responds that: 1) Every SF series does it; 2) The critics are nitpicking; and 3) The laws of nature might be different \\"out there.\\"  He thus displays a deep misunderstanding of: 1) The nature of televised SF; 2) The nature of SF in general; and 3) The nature of science.<br /><br />I watched nearly every episode of \\"Space: 1999\\" during its run, and remember many of them fondly.  I remember the series as a whole as an interesting failure: full of interesting ideas, but undermined by bad science, a dramatically flawed premise, bland dialogue, and a near-total lack of engaging characters.  I'm willing to be convinced that it was better than that, but Muir has utterly failed to do so.<br /><br />Five stars for devoted fans of the series (who will be predisposed to buy Muir's arguments); three for the (probably few) others deeply enough interested in televised SF to consider buying a copy.sult of *both* series drawing on an established science fiction plot device (see, for example, John W.

Major characters from the first six books (Craig Lowell, Sandy Felter) are supporting characters here, and the focus is on characters that didn't exist (or received limited attention) in the main series.<br /><br />One happy result of this is that, although \\"The New Breed\\" *can* be read as part of the original series (Note: Descriptions of it as a \\"prequel\\" to \\"The Generals\\" notwithstanding, it's really read better *after* that book) it also works perfectly well as a stand-alone novel. Fans of the series will see dimensions in the  Craig Lowell/Geoff Craig relationships that first-timers won't, but those nuances aren't critical to enjoying the story.<br /><br />The story proper is about U. S. Army intervention in the former Belgian Congo during its post-independence civil war . . . an aspect of the Cold War that most Americans know about only from an old Tom Lehrer lyric about making peace \\"the way we did in Stanleyville and Saigon.\\"  Griffin makes good use of the post-colonial setting, and Col. Michael \\"Mad Mike\\" Hoare, a famous leader of mercenaries in the real world, makes a credible supporting character.  The three leading fictional characters, Karl-Heinz Wagner, Geoffrey Craig, and Jacques \\"Jack\\" Portet are all drawn well enough to be interesting, and Griffin uses Wagner (an East German defector) and Portet (a Belgian-American airline pilot who gets drafted) to say some thoughtful things about loyalty and cultural differences.<br /><br />What really makes a novel like this stand or fall, however, is the quality of the plot, and here (perhaps sensing that he's writing a stand-alone story) Griffin does better than usual at creating a story arc that lasts through the whole book, ties the characters together, and comes to a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />This is (like Griffin's other books) more a \\"military procedural\\" than a slam-bang, shoot-em-up \\"war story.\\"  That may disappoint some readers (try Wilbur Smith's \\"Dark of the Sun\\" or \\"Cry Wolf\\") but it's true to the characters and material in a way that extravagant violence wouldn't be.

It digs deeply into the issues at hand, offers carefully measured conclusions, and supports those conclusions with a wealth of evidence.  He makes a persuasive case for the idea that  the technologies that made possible long-range precision bombing and amphibious assault were created by a complex set of forces: some technological, others political, still others institutional.  Moy's treatment of amphibious assault is particularly welcome, since (unlike long-range bombing) it has received little attention from historians.<br /><br />Moy is also a graceful and efficient writer.  His argument flows smoothly, and--even when deeply immersed in details--he never loses sight of the point those details are intended to reinforce.

First, everyone knows (and many have written aboout) the central event of Armstrong's public life: the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon. Second, Armstrong is a fiercely private person who rarely speaks in public and has never (to my knowledge) consented to an interview since leaving NASA.  Third, science writers like Andrew Chaikin (\\"A Man on the Moon\\") and astronauts like Michael Collins (\\"Carrying the Fire\\") and Gene Cernan (\\"Last Man on the Moon\\") have set the bar *very* high for those who have come after them.<br /><br />Leon Wagener's new biography of Armstrong fails on all three counts.  It adds little to what we already know about Armstrong's career, offers minimal insight into Armstrong the person, and is marred throughout by a grating prose style and abominable editing.<br /><br />Wagener's biography is a patchwork of interviews with friends and family members, quotes from newspapers and magazines, and gleanings from NASA records. This works reasonably well in the first and last sections of the book: Wagener is the first writer to deal in detail with Armstrong's life before coming to NASA (in the late 1950s) and after leaving it (in the early 1970s). Few readers, however, would pick up a book-length biography of Neil Armstrong *solely* to learn about those parts of his life.  The method breaks down, however, in the long mid-section of the book, where the subject is Armstrong's years in the space program.  Here, piecing together the facts is not enough: We already know the story.  We *want* to know what Armstrong thought about it all, and that is the one thing that Wagener cannot deliver.<br /><br />Even the relatively effective parts of the book are undone, however, by the quality of the writing.  Writing about some of the most dramatic events of the twentieth century, Wagener tries relentlessly to pump up the drama by adding adjectives to every noun, adverbs to every verb, and extra clauses to every other sentence. There is nothing inherently wrong with this kind of dramatic prose--Norman Mailer used it in \\"Of A Fire On The Moon\\" and Tom Wolfe used it in \\"The Right Stuff\\"--but Mailer and Wolfe are masters of the English language.  Wagener has a tin ear, and it shows on every page.  The difference between the right word and the almost-right word, Mark Twain famously wrote, is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.  This book is infested with lightning bugs.<br /><br />It is also, sadly, infested with factual errors.  Navigation lights twinkle in airless space, the invention of the turbojet engine is attributed to the wrong person (and placed in the wrong year), the X-15 rocket plane is misleadingly described as a hypersonic glider (a description that fits the never-built X-20 far better), and the Ford Trimotor is inexplicably described as a weapon of war (which the later and superficially similar Junkers Ju-52 eventually became, but the Ford never did).<br /><br />Readers have not been well served by Wagener's editors, who should have at least thinned out the factual errors and style-deaf sentences.  Nor have they been well served by the decision (by the author, editors, or both) to omit *any* form of references,  bibliography, or even a complete list of interviewees.  Readers interested in the sources of specific details are left with no way to *find* those sources.  Especially given the numerous factual errors (which would make double-checking essential for anyone wanting to use the book as a reference), this is goes beyond frustrating into outrageous.<br /><br />POSTSCRIPT (December 2005): James R.

Many types are covered by multiple photographs, including a number that I'd never seen in 30+ years of reading about the history of aviation.  The photographs may, depending on your interests, be worth the price of the book.<br /><br />The text is another story entirely<br /><br />There is, to begin with, very little text.  Each aircraft gets a single explanatory paragraph and a small box that lists basic information (where known) about its performance.  The performance information is frequently spotty, and the descriptive paragraphs are frequently interrupted by the author's smirking asides and strained attempts at cuteness.  Even given the one-paragraph-per-plane limit, the descriptions are notable for their shallowness and lack of useful information.<br /><br />The text is also marred by errors.  Some are subtle and ultimately trivial, like the misspelling of \\"Dreidecker,\\" German for \\"triplane,\\" as \\"dridecker.\\"  Others are glaring: To say that the X-15 was the \\"ancestor\\" (rather than \\"descendent\\") of the X-1 is either a ludicrous error of fact or an eighth-grade-level confusion of two words with related (but opposite) meanings.  At times, the author overreaches to make a point, as when he claims that Apollo lunar lander and the sleek silver spaceships of 1950s science-fiction both landed \\"tail first.\\"  At other times, as when discussing the highly corrosive fuel used to power the Me-163 rocket plane, he neglects information that would have reinforced his point.  At least once, he flatly contradicts himself, disparaging the handling characteristics of an airplane that, elsewhere on the same page, he describes test pilots as praising.<br /><br />The most fundamental problem with the book, however, is that it has no unifying theme or organizing principle.  The title suggests a book about aircraft with fatally flawed or ill-conceived designs, and it covers many such machines.  It also, however, includes a generous selection of aircraft that performed adequately but: a) Were designed for roles that turned out to be unnecessary; or b) Failed for reasons unrelated to their design; or even c) Just looked weird.  The Bell RP-63 Kingcobra--a specially armored aircraft *designed* to be shot at in gunnery exercises--apparently makes the list because the concept now seems so outlandish.  The assymetrical Blohm & Voss BV-141 performed well, but is (again, apparently) included to be snickered at.  The famous \\"Vin Fiz,\\" a Wright Model B that made the first flight across the USA in 1911, also gets an entry, but why?  Apparently, because pilot Cal Rodgers crashed a lot along the way.<br /><br />Shallow analysis, excessive cuteness, and nonexistent theme would be less galling if this was the first \\"Bad Aircraft Design\\" book on the market, but it is far from that.  Bill Yenne's oversized \\"The World's Worst Aircraft\\" and James Gilbert's standard-sized book of the same title offer detailed history and serious analysis but *still* contain a great deal of humor.  R. E. G. Davies' \\"Fallacies and Fantasies of Air Transport History\\" takes on a variety of flawed concepts (flying cars, dirigibiles, supersonic transports, commercial flying boats), skewering sacred cows with razor-sharp technical and economic arguments.  Any of the three is a far better investment, and a far better education in bad aircraft design, than \\"The Wrong Stuff.\\"<br /><br />Recommended (and worth two stars) *only* for those deeply interested in the pictures and willing to ignore the text.o, however, includes a generous selection of aircraft that performed adequately but: a) Were designed for roles that turned out to be unnecessary; or b) Failed for reasons unrelated to their design; or even c) Just looked weird.

The underwater scenes are excellent (as always), the descriptions of the Bahamas are vivid, and the wealth of technical details about diving and salvage work never slow the plot down.  Best of all, unlike _Hatteras Blue_, the big plot twist that Poyer springs near the end of the story makes sense and ties together a lot of seemingly loose ends.  Galloway is still a likable character, still wishing he could shake off the past and still unable to do it.<br />As maritime thrillers go, _Bahamas Blue_ isn't quite up to the standards set by Sam Llewellyn, Hammond Innes, and Brian Callison, but its a solid piece of work and an excellent choice for fans of the genre.	2004-06-06

Griffin's &quot;Brotherhood of War&quot; series does just that: always competently, sometimes brilliantly. The flashes of brilliance are fewer and farther between in _The Colonels_ than they were in _The Lieutenants_ and _The Captains_, but they're definitely *there* in a way that they weren't in _The Majors_.<br />The action in _The Colonels_ takes place in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  The central thread of the plot is the establishment of the Green Berets, and most of the book's best scenes revolve around the shaping of the Green Beret program.  The book ends with the disastrous US-backed attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro by landing a force of Cuban exiles at the Bay of Pigs--an operation in which many of the characters play peripheral roles.  Griffin keeps old plotlines in play, but also takes the time to service a number of characters who were in danger of slipping out of the story: notably Barbara Bellmon, Paul Jiggs, and Phil Parker IV.<br />Griffin's ear for soldiers' voices and his familiarity with military routine comes through in many individual scenes: several training exercises, an unauthorized visit to an aircraft graveyard, Mac Macmillan's chance encounter with a young lieutenant, and a running subplot about the Green Berets' distinctive headgear.  The bureaucratic guerilla warfare that took up much of _The Majors_ is back, but it works better in _The Colonels_, perhaps because the outcome will affect the lives, not just the careers, of people we care about.<br />_The Colonels_ ultimately fails, however, to hit the same heights that _The Lieutentants_ and _The Captains_ reached.  Part of the problem may be the time frame it covers.  _The Lieutenants_ had the shift from WWII to the Cold War; _The Captains_ had Korea; _The Colonels_ has the Bay of Pigs, but not yet Vietnam.  Especially when it strays from the &quot;building the Green Berets&quot; thread, it often feels like it's just marking time.trays from the &quot;building the Green Berets&quot; thread, it often feels like it's just marking time.	2004-06-06

Griffin's &quot;The Brotherhood of War&quot; is the second kind of series, and it's virtually impossible (and certainly unfair) to review one of its &quot;middle&quot; books *except* as part of the larger series.  _The Majors_ doesn't match the standard set in _The Lieutenants_ and _The Captains_, but it's a workmanlike entry that keeps the series moving.<br />&quot;Brotherhood of War&quot; is, as another reviewer said of a different volume in the series, a &quot;military soap opera.&quot;  It's concerned, for the most part, not with battles but with the rhythms of Army lives and careers: changes of post, changes of assignment, promotions, decorations, unexpected reunions with old comrades, and so on.  The series has, by now, upwards of three dozen significant continuing characters . . . six or eight of whom qualify as major (in significance, not rank). That's a lot of fictional lives to keep straight and a lot of storylines to keep in motion, but Griffin pulls it off with considerable skill.  _The Majors_ keeps  you abreast of all the main players from the earlier books, and adds several new ones.  Its a fast, satisfying read, and left me eager to pick up _The Colonels_.<br />That said, _The Majors_ is a step down from _The Lieutenants_ and  _The Captains_.  There're a few gunfights, but no big combat scene like the mountain battle in Greece (Bk. 1) or the commando raid into North Korea (Bk. 2). Craig Lowell and Sandy Felter, whose growth as people and as officers gave the first two books much of their depth, are less compelling in _The Majors_.  Felter has become more of a plot device than a person.  Lowell is in danger of becoming what he threatened to be early in _The Lieutenants_: an insufferable twit with more money than brains.  The rest of the main characters fare better, but none of them has the kind of life-changing story arc that Felter got in Book 1 or Lowell got in Book 2.<br />If you loved the first two books in the series, _The Majors_ will have plenty to keep you interested.  If you found yourself wishing that the first two books had more shooting and less soap opera, you'll be even less satisfied this time around.e of them has the kind of life-changing story arc that Felter got in Book 1 or Lowell got in Book 2.<br />If you loved the first two books in the series, _The Majors_ will have plenty to keep you interested.

US	51990025	R78UL2TWU9QRK	0312089260	227598864	Writing Science Fiction & Fantasy: 20 Dynamic Essays by the Field's Top Professionals	Books	3	48	48	N	N	Wildly Uneven, But Worth it For The Good Bits	At the most basic level, this book delivers what the title and subtitle promises: How-to essays by some of the biggest names (as of the mid-1980s) in science fiction writing.  The majority deal with science fiction (rather than fantasy) and with magazine (as  opposed to book-length) pieces.  Would-be fantasy writers should beware, but should also be willing to cut the editors a little slack on the subject.  New writers with no track record and no agent (the book's target audience) have always had an easier time publishing short fiction than novels.  Fantasy is (and has been for decades) almost entirely published as novels, but there's still (if only barely) a market for magazine-length science fiction.<br />The book is not, however, what it clearly *wants* to be: THE book for writers trying to break into the genre. The essays in it were written at different times and for different purposes.  They vary wildly in length, depth, and (most critical) in the amount of knowledge they assume on the part of the reader.  Trying to read the book straight through can give you a severe case of intellectual whiplash.  If you want a unified, coherent book about how to write quality science fiction and fantasy, this is NOT it.  (Try Orson Scott Card's _How To Write Science Fiction and Fantasy_ or Barry Longyear's _Notes to a Science Fiction Writer_ instead.)<br />The real gems of this book include, as other reviewers have noted, Stanley Schmidt on worn-out plot devices and Connie Willis on humor.  IF you want to write hard science fiction (stories where the scientific details are firmly in the foreground and integral to the story), then add Hal Clement's on aliens to that list.  IF you want to write fantasy, then add Jane Yolen's superb essay on using elements from mythology and legend.  Either group could benefit from Poul Anderson's essay on world-building.  (As Diana Wynne Jones pointed out in her hilarious _Tough Guide to Fantasyland_, fantasy writers are notorious for creating worlds that make no ecological sense.)<br />The book is, ironicaly, least useful where it's most closely concerned with the mechanics of writing.  Isaac Asimov's five essays are breezy and genial but offer little in the way of really concrete advice.  Robert Heinlein's single essay (written in the early 1950s, if memory serves) is valuable *only* if you keep in mind that it was written when the market for magazine SF was *much* larger than it is today.  Sheila Williams' essay on &quot;The Mechanics of Submission&quot; is now badly out of date, since it was written before e-mail and inkjet printers.  Many of the markets listed at the end of the book have, sadly, ceased publication years ago.<br />The good bits of this book are very, very good.  The essays by Anderson, Willis, and Yolen alone are worth the price of (paperback) admission.

This book is a refreshing exception to that pattern.  It's subtitled &quot;the story of the family that built the World Trade Center,&quot; and that's *exactly* what you get.  _Men of Steel_ is the story of the rise and fall of a family construction company and the stormy relationships among the men who built it.  Koch treats both sides of the story--family and business--honestly and in detail, and the results are gripping. It hits many of the same notes as John Steinbeck's _East of Eden_, Arthur Miller's _Death of a Salesman_, or Ken Kesey's _Sometimes a Great Notion_... but in _Men of Steel_ you know that the narrator's pain (both physical and emotional) is real.<br />You learn a lot about ironworking in this book: About how the steel frames of buildings are put together, and about how the tools and techniques have changed over time.  You also learn a lot about construction management: Estimating costs, writing bids, dealing with suppliers and unions, and keeping things running smoothly on the building site.  Koch writes from the manager's perspective more than the workers, but there are other books (say, Mike Cherry's _On High Steel_) to give you that.  Even dedicated civil engineering buffs are likely to learn a lot from Koch and Firstman's sure-footed narrative.  The chapter (or so) on &quot;kangaroo cranes&quot; alone is worth the price of the book.<br />Koch and Firstman also give a unique view of *one* aspect of the World Trade Center project: How the framing and flooring was erected and what the process did for (and to) the company.  They reveal things about that aspect of the process that no other book does--much of it critically important.  This is exactly the  right approach to take: ironwork is Koch's (and his family's) business, it's what he knows, and it's what the rest of the book is about.  It means, however, that _Men of Steel_ is *not* a book about &quot;the building of the World Trade Center.&quot;  Rather, it's a book in which the ironwork that went into the World Trade Center is one of several key threads.<br />The epilogue, dealing with the 9/11 attacks and the collapse of the Twin Towers deserves special notice.  It is short, concise, and unflinchingly honest: a model of how we *ought* to learn from the unexpected failures of less-than-perfect structures.  If I could figure out how to do it, I'd make those 15 pages required reading for the engineers-in-training that I teach.  They could have far, far worse role models than Karl Koch III.<br />How much you like this book will depend a great deal on what you want to get out of it.  If you want THE book on the building of  the World Trade Center, you may well be disapprounted.  If you want a great family saga, a great business story, or a gripping insider's history of ironworking in America (including the WTC), you may well have a hard time putting _Men of Steel_ down.t &quot;the building of the World Trade Center.&quot;  Rather, it's a book in which the ironwork that went into the World Trade Center is one of several key threads.<br />The epilogue, dealing with the 9/11 attacks and the collapse of the Twin Towers deserves special notice.

The book's two narrative threads--the histories of the United States and of six generations of Pearl's family--intertwine neatly.  The pictures are a delight, and their folk art style lends a nice sense of continuity to the book.<br />Kids in grades 2-4 who are interested in US history--fans of the Magic Treehouse or American Girl books, say--will enjoy it.  It's also a natural read-aloud for families and a springboard for talking about great events that members of your own family witnessed or lived through.<br />One Warning: Partly to make the narrative work, but partly out of simple carelesseness, Atwell plays a little fast-and-loose with the facts.  The eastern end of the transcontinental railroad was Omaha, not Boston, and though you could probably take the train to Texas in 1869, it wasn't *that* train.  Kitty Hawk was sand dunes, not grass and there was no road access to it in 1903 (even if a family *could* have undertaken an interstate drive in a 1900-era car).  The US was not drawn into WWI for nearly three years after it began in 1914, and then not by treaties with European countries but by German submarine attacks on its ships.  Neither Wilbur nor Orville Wright were still designing airplanes by 1917; Wilbur, in fact, had died in 1912.  WWII began, for the United States, as a war against Hirohito more than Hitler (who'd been gobbling up Europe for 2+ years by December 1941 with only limited, back-door US opposition).  Alan Shepard, the first American in space, blasted off in May 1961, not 1960.<br />Bottom Line: This is a five-star story but a two-star history book.  To paraphrase former President Reagan: \\"Read and enjoy . . . but verify.\\"	2004-04-20

It also, along the way, helps to do for support troops what Ernie Pyle (then) and Stephen Ambrose (lately) did for combat troops . . . record and pass on their stories of &quot;what it was like.&quot;  The fact that many of the soldiers whose stories are told in RTV are African-American addds a third valuable dimension to the book.<br />So why only three stars?  Well . . .<br />David Colley writes like an experienced, and very talented, magazine writer who hasn't developed a feel for how to structure a book-length story.  RTV is a mosaic of brief, topical chapters that are complete in themselves but add up (more or less) to a complete picture of life on the Red Ball.  It *feels* like an extended series of magazine articles rather than a unified book.  I often had the sense that, if I reshuffled the chapters in random order, it would read just as smoothly.  I can accept that in a reference book, but a straight-ahead work of history needs more shape.<br />What I missed, throughout the book, was any sense that Colley had  digested all the (fascinating) information he presents.  So much of the material was new to me that I kept waiting for him to draw conclusions that were equally new and fascinating.  Instead, Colley told me things that I already knew: Mechanized transport was crucial to the Allied victory in Europe, Americans have a talent for improvisation, and overt racism was less prominent in Europe than in the 1940s USA.<br />This book is well worth buying and well worth reading, but the definitive history of the Red Ball has yet to be written.  Any WWII historians out there looking for a great project?	2002-12-10

The pilots of the 332nd fought long and hard in the skies over North Africa, Italy, and Central Europe.  They racked up an impressive record of enemy aircraft shot down, ground targets destroyed and--on the bomber-escort missions they often flew--friendly planes brought home safely.  They also paved the way for the integration of the armed forces, and of American society generally, by showing that blacks could handle the stress of battle  and the demands of high-performance airplanes just as well as whites.  In a world where many (most?) whites saw blacks as innately inferior, the Tuskegee Airmen proved otherwise.<br />This book is a dense, detailed, information-packed history of the 332nd during and immediately after the war.  It's a valuable source on a vital topic, and I'm glad it's out there.<br />That doesn't, however, make it a great book.<br />The style, for close to 400 pages, is choppy and unpolished with only a vague suggestion of a strong narrative line.  Context is spotty at best, and technical terms sometimes go unexplained.  The typography is idiosyncratic, and the inexplicable rendering of nicknames in italics and ranks, abbreviated, in ALL CAPS is distracting in a book where names come thick and fast.  The type face itself is ugly, and the reproduction of many of the pictures  is substandard.  The index consists almost solely of personal names, which makes it intensely frustrating to use if you're not already intimately familiar with the story.  To look up an incident in which two members of the 332nd sank a German destroyer, you have to know what their names were . . . no entry for \\"destroyer,\\" or \\"strafing,\\" or \\"naval vessels.\\"<br />If there were other books out there that provide the sheer volume  of facts about the subject that this one does, I'd give it about a star-and-a-half.  There aren't, but there ought to be.  The 332nd was noted for its professionalism; it deserves a more professionally-done history.

BUY it now (lest it go out of print, as Spider's books have an inexplicable and depressing tendancy to do), but put it away until you've read _Stardance_ and _Starseed_.<br />There, now that's out of the way.  On with the review.<br />This book, especially in the context of the series, is a consistently entertaining, rewarding exploration of the themes that dominate the Robinsons' best work.  Little stuff, like (in no particular order): love, sex, creativity, art, transcendence, home, commitment, and so forth.  It says something about their abilities as a writing team that all this is unfolded through living, breathing characters that you quickly come to care deeply about . . . and want to find happiness (even if it's not at all clear that they will).  Likable, intelligent characters have always been Spider's greatest strength, and this story is no exception.  Whether or not the plot &quot;works&quot; for you is almost beside the point.  Even if it doesn't, the characters and the ways in which they grow and change make the book worth reading.<br />This is *not* a trilogy in the conventional SF sense.  The three books form distinct segments of a long arc, but they have independent casts (for the most part) with their own strengths and weaknesses.  It's one of the delights of _Starmind_ that Rhea is clearly *not* a (literary) clone of Rain M'Cloud or Sharra Drummond, and that Rand is *not* just another Charlie Armstead.<br />One final note: The Robinsons may live in British Columbia, but in the scenes set in Provincetown, MA this Bay State expatriate  could hear the surf, smell the salt, and taste the Portuguese sweet bread again. Craftsmanship even in places where most people won't notice it is a glorious thing.	2001-09-21

Thanks to the staggering success of Dava Sobel's _Longitude_ a few years back, we now have a flourishing subgenre of similar works. It might be called something like: \\"Smallish books about great achievements in the history of science and technology and the amazing people behind them.\\" Bella Bathurst has written a fine example of the subgenre; if you liked _Longitude_ and _The Professor and the Madman_ you'll like this one too.<br /><br />On the good side: Bathurst can write smooth, engaging prose that keeps you turning the pages. She sketches the landscape and her main characters neatly and economically, and has a nice eye for anecdotes. She keeps you interested and gives you a fair sense of what it was like to build lighthouses in the 19th century.<br /><br />On the bad side: The character sketches remain just that--sketches. I don't feel like I know *any* of the Stevensons as rounded human beings; nor do I have a sense for the changing millieu in which they worked. The descriptions of the lighthouses have the same problem. Bathurst clearly doesn't care much about the details of the technology or the construction methods . . . but I *want* her to care, and to explain them to me, because that's a big part of what makes the Stevenson story so extraordinary. How *do* you hoist multi-ton blocks of stone off a pitching barge onto a slippery rock, anyway?<br /><br />Let me be fair: I *enjoyed* the book as I read it. Ultimately, though, it left me feeling unsatisfied. This is history-of-technology lite . . . a pale imitation of modern classics like David McCullough's _The Great Bridge_ and _The Path Between the Seas_ or Stephen Ambrose's _Nothing Like It in the World_. It's a pale imitation, too, of journalistic work about extreme environments, like that of Sebastian Junger, John McPhee, and Jon Krakauer. All those authors give better value for the money than Bathurst: fully rounded characters and total immersion in the details of the events and processes they're writing about.	2001-08-30

I *should* love this book--tried hard to love it, in fact--but in the end I couldn't manage that.<br />Taves knows his historical adventure movies.  He covers all the famous ones and many so obscure that I found myself wondering where he'd found a copy to watch.  He's also studied the contours of the genre, thought a lot about them, and tried hard to explain those thoughts in a series of well organized chapters.  The book certainly fills a niche for people (like me) who study this kind of stuff, and if you're one of them the book is well worth your money.  There is, truly, no other book I know of that does what this one does.  For *that* audience, I'd probably give it a 4-star rather than a 2-star rating.<br />Why, then, the 2-star rating?  Because I think that most readers who *aren't* academics are going to find this pretty dry going.  It seldom stops to consider any particular film in detail, using them instead like stones in a mosaic: bits of color whose real significance comes from their place in the larger pattern.  You learn a lot about the genre as a genre, but little about the films themselves (or the people who made and acted in them).  Once or twice, when the book *does* take on a film in detail (&quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot; or several versions of &quot;The Four Feathers&quot;), its analysis is brilliant . . . but those are isolated episodes rather than a sustained pattern.  The book is solidly done, serious stuff.  It's a sustained, well-supported scholarly argument.  It's just not a lot of fun . . . as the movies it talks about so often are.<br />I will, without question, hang on to my copy.  I'll refer back to it, reference it in my work, and be glad that Brian Taves wrote it.  But I don't think that (as I do with George MacDonald Fraser's _Hollywood History of the World_) I'll pick it up just to  reread a chapter for my own enjoyment.njoyment.	2001-03-30

The book delivers on that promise, and the result is a delight to read.  Bauer walks you, surefootedly, through sixty-odd years of Nessie sightings, as well as reactions to them by the public and the scientific community.  If you want a reliable, detailed, neutral study of the Loch Ness mystery--here's your book.<br />The icing on the intellectual cake is that Bauer is interested in more than just Loch Ness.  He makes clear in his introduction that he wants to explore how science works and, once again, the book delivers. Bauer walks you, again surefootedly, through concepts like &quot;data&quot; &quot;proof&quot; &quot;theory&quot; and so forth, carefully leaving in the kinds of grey areas that working scientists have to deal with.  Two of the best chapters in the book are titled &quot;Bad Reasons for Believing&quot; and &quot;Bad Reasons for Not Believing.&quot;  Together (especially in the context of the entire book) they're one of the best discussions of scientific reasoning I've ever read.<br />Recommended for anyone with a serious interest in science . . . even if you don't really care whether there's anything bigger than a trout in Loch Ness.	2001-03-13

I know it's possible, because Angus Kress Gillespie (along with a co-author whose name escapes me) has already  written one about the New Jersey Turnpike.  The Turnpike Book was  brilliant, but _Twin Towers_ is no more than good. It covers its intended  subjects with clarity and precision, but (unlike the Turnpike book), I was  never particularly driven to push on to the next section.<br />Partly, I  think, the problem is familiarity.  Most of us are a lot less familiar with  the history and inner workings of a major highway than with the inner  workings of a major skyscraper.  There's something fascinating about  listening to an expert explain, layer by layer, the hidden mysteries of  some overly familiar piece of the everyday world.  It's harder to do that  with the World Trade Center because--to some extent--we *do* know about  very tall buildings and what they're like.<br />Part of the problem, too, may  be a basic difference of opinion between Gillespie and I.  He clearly  thinks that the WTC is a beautiful structure, and one that the  architectural establishment (which hates it) hasn't given a fair shake. I'm  not an architect, but I never liked it much either. Despite his best  efforts, I *still* don't like it that much, and by about halfway through  the book, his praise of it was beginning to wear thin.<br />Gillespie is a  clear and graceful writer (if only he could stop saying &quot;as we shall  see&quot; so often he'd be even better), and he makes the complex  comprehensible. If the idea of a book about the inner workings of one of  the world's tallest buildings intrigues you, then _Twin Towers_ is well  worth checking out.	2000-04-07

Reading Sarris's (mostly) short essays is like being walked through a film storage vault by  a knowledgeable, opinionated old tour guide who's seen every picture and  seemingly met everyone who helped to make them.  You may not always agree  with his take on the pictures you know well, but he's always worth  listening to.  And you finish the tour ready to spend the next several  weekends watching all the great movies that he's pointed out to  you.<br />Sarris's treatments of individual directors are, by a long shot, the  best part of the book. His essays on actors, mostly shorter and less  comprehensive, are also well worth the reading.  The observations on genres  and studios seem sketchy by comparison, especially by comparison with books  like Ethan Mordden's _Hollywood Studios_.  The essays stand well on their  own, which makes the book ideal for reading in essay-at-a-time chunks, but  keeps it from being a comprehensive introduction to the period.<br />If you  want to read one and only one book on classic Hollywood movies, this isn't  it.  If you want to read, several, this should certainly be one of them.	2000-03-29

Reading this book is like spending a long weekend with a new friend about your own age, wallowing in music and decades-old sitcom reruns while you trade memories that begin &quot;Did you ever see . . . ?&quot; and  &quot;Remember the one about. . . ?&quot; You laugh yourselves silly, but  also come away with a new appreciation for how TV, movies, and music helped  you define who you were and how you saw the world.<br />OK, I'll be honest.  _Where The Girls Are_ is also a first-rate introduction by example to the  field of media studies, a brilliant defense of feminism, a scathingly funny  critique of American broadcast journalism and an insightful exploration of  the complex ways that girls and women relate to the steady stream of female  images they're fed by the mass media.  But if I led with that paragraph,  the book wouldn't sound like it was any fun at all.  And it *is* fun.  Oh,  my, is it fun.<br />Susan Douglas starts from the idea that, although her  experiences and those of her friends (white, middle-class, suburban,  straight, Baby-Boom-era women) aren't universal, they *can* be used to  illustrate larger truths about how people relate to the mass media.  She  proceeds, for 300 pages, to do just that.  Her analyses are always sharp  (you will *never* look at &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; the same way again),  and her prose is as far from academic-ese as you can get: funny, pointed,  and (when the subject warrants it) wrath-of-God angry at some of the  manifest injustices she describes.<br />Read this book.  Even if you're not  part of the Baby Boom generation.  Even if you're not a woman.  Trust me.	2000-03-26

It misses being a good choice  for #1 for several reasons:<br />1) Time Frame.  Fuller wrote in 1945, and so  his treatment of the nuclear age is speculative rather than retrospective.  The speculations are nearly all interesting, but they focus on nuclear  weapons to the exclusion of conventional arms with which post-1945 wars  were actually fought.<br />2) Depth.  Fuller is exhaustive on land warfare in  the 1800-1945 era, but often sketchy on the pre-industrial era(s) and on  anything connected with the sea.  The things he does have to say are  interesting and well supported, but the background to make sense of them is  often lacking.<br />3) Perspective.  Fuller was a career military officer and  one of the people who developed the tactics (in 1917-1919) for what became  (in 1939-45) modern, highly mobile land warfare.  His view of history is  (reasonably and properly) shaped by that experience, and it helps to have  some sense of Fuller the military thinker *before* you approach Fuller the  historian.<br />None of these faults keeps _Armarments and History_ from  succeeding on its own terms.  It's a thoughtful and well-documented  argument.  Readers interested in military history and military technology  will find a lot of valuable insights and ideas in it. BUT if you're looking  for a first (or only) book to read on the subject, try Martin Van Creveld's  _Technology and War_ or Robert O'Connell's _Arms and Men_ or Bernard and  Fawn Brodie's _From Crossbow to H-Bomb_ (roughly in that order of  preference).	2000-03-10

Being  singletons, these stories don't give the same emotional satisfaction as  (say) another visit to Callahan's or Lady Sally's, but on their own terms  they're both thought-provoking and full of undisguised affection for the  human race and its various members.<br />I invariably put down a Spider  Robinson book with a wide grin, a racing mind, and a more optimistic  outlook on life and its possibilities.  If that ain't good value for your  six bucks plus shipping, I don't know what is . . .<br />Fair Warning: DO NOT  read the back-cover blurb, in which an unspeakable copywriter at Baen Books  gives away crucial parts of two stories and the entire point of a third.	2000-01-15

The material between ranges from adequate (a solid  but pedestrial treatment of Britain's bungling before the American  Revolution) to awful (a peevish, presentist scolding of the Renaissance  Popes) to irrelevant (what is Troy, whose internal politics remain obscure,  *doing* in this book as a case study?).<br />Saying that &quot;It seemed like  a good idea at the time,&quot; then going on to explore *why* it seemed  like one, is nearly always an effective way to understand the actions of  historical figures.  For Tuchman, though, the answer always seems to be the  same: &quot;It seemed like a good idea because they were too stupid, venal,  deluded, or blind to see that it wasn't.&quot;  This doesn't help us, much,  in understanding history or applying its lessons.<br />The notable exception  to this--the one chapter where Tuchman seems willing to trace the internal  logic of misgovernment--is the Vietnam chapter.  If you're interested in,  but not an expert on, Vietnam, that chapter may be worth the price of the  book.	1999-10-23
US	51990025	R1QHVMXQJJ8442	0385484372	98818293	The Meaning of Star Trek	Books	3	9	10	N	N	Not perfect, but fun for intellectually-inclined fans	Anyone who's not a devoted fan of Star Trek, particularly of its Next Generation incarnation, is likely to find this book incomprehensible. They're also unlikely to buy it in the first place.  Richards does ST the  honor of taking it seriously, and he offers steady supply of nifty  interpretations of what it has to say about life, the universe, and  everything. His glosses of individual episodes are superb, and he's led me  to rethink several of my favorites.  This is literary scholarship written  for a literate nonspecialist audience . . . and good scholarship at  that.<br />Well, mostly good.<br />As noted elsewhere, Richards purports to cover  the entire ST mythos, but focuses 80% of his major arguments on the  &quot;Next Generation&quot; series.  This weakens some of his  interpretations, which fit TNG better than the mythos as a whole.  The  theatrical movies get virtually no coverage, again glossing over some  troublesome diversity of data.<br />Richards fares considerably worse when he  ventures outside of ST. His perceptions of Science Fiction as a genre are  based on &quot;Star Wars,&quot; Asimov's &quot;Foundation Trilogy,&quot;  Herbert's &quot;Dune,&quot; and some passing references to Verne and Wells.  His entire reading in SF history and criticism seems to have been Brian  Aldiss's brilliant but notoriously polemical 1973 history &quot;Billion  Year Spree.&quot;<br />Virtually every generalization Richards makes about SF  as a genre is, to be charitable, in dire need of qualification.  Trek fans  unfamiliar with the genre should *not* take them at face value.  Trek fans  familiar with the genre should brace themselves.  Profane exclamations of  disbelief are optional.	1999-05-29

The trouble is, a lot more of us talk about it than actually sit down and *do*  it.  David Cordingly did do it, and the result is a model of what history  written for non-specialists should be.<br />This is far and away the best  introduction to the history of piracy ever produced.  Cordingly writes  clearly and smoothly, and covers an astonishing amount of historical ground  very economically.  The book hits the highlights of major historical  disagreements about pirates without ever getting bogged down in them, and  tells its tales of death and mayhem without losing sight of the fact that  the victims are usually innocent people in the wrong place at the wrong  time.<br />This book is well worth the time of anyone interested in the  history of ships and seafaring.  Patrick O'Brian fans, here's something to  pass the time until Aubrey and Maturin get underway again!	1999-02-24

The chapters are short,  and the overall effect is a lot like sitting around listening to a bunch of  old-timers spinning yarns about their time at sea.  Some of the stories are  exciting (Eddie Albert's), some are dull (Rock Hudson's), and at least one  (Jack Lemmon's) is falling-down funny.<br />Though it may not have been the  authors' purpose, the book also highlights an important truth about modern  war: most of those who serve do so by doing dull, repetitive, vital jobs  far from the front lines.  &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; may be the most  realistic war story of our era, after all.	1999-01-11
