When she writes nature essays, as in this collection, her style is not that of the journalist (like, say, John McPhee) or even the activist (Rick Bass).  Instead, her words are imbued with beauty and wisdom and spirituality.  While I hesitate to use the term &quot;Native American writer&quot; to describe Hogan because I believe any such terminology to be limiting, in her case it is necessary because her Chickasaw background informs so much of her work.  The plains of Oklahoma, snakes, dreams, a suspicion of technology, and bats all feature prominently in her writing.  Hogan doesn't always deal well with the specifics of ecology--she suggests, for example, that wolves never predate on livestock, which of course is an oversimplification of lupine behavior--but she writes extremely well about the importance of human beings seeking a spiritual connection with the natural world.  I highly recommend this book, particularly to anyone wishing to teach high school students about the spirituality of nature.	2001-10-08

It seems to me that the short story is Morgan's strongest literary form; whereas his novels tend to be tedious and his poetry somewhat bland, his stories often carry some genuine emotional punch.  These stories, arranged in a generally chronological (in terms of the time in which the pieces are set, not when they were written or published) sequence, are all set in the Southern Appalachians, where Morgan was born and raised (although he now teaches at Cornell University).  &quot;The Tracks of Chief DeSoto,&quot; perhaps the best story in the anthology, is set in a Cherokee village at the time of the arrival of the first white explorers to visit the mountains, while &quot;The Balm of Gilead Tree&quot; is set in modern time.  Nearly all the stories have a powerful sense of pathos, although Morgan occasionally injects a dose of grim humor.  These are stories of exploitation, depression, loss, death, disappointment, and occasional small triumph.  I have heard Morgan say during a lecture that he writes stories which have a sense of inevitability, whose outcomes seem to follow directly from what happens earlier in the story.  He accomplishes this, although the sense of inevitability also results in a predictable approach to storytelling.  Nothing happens to his characters that is unexpected or clever; they live simply and according to a cosmic plan.  They are believable people, but I sometimes found myself wishing that they were a little less ordinary.  I recommend this collection to lovers of Robert Morgan, as well as anyone interested in the craft of writing short stories, particularly stories with a strong sense of place.  This book leaves the reader with the smell of sweat, hog, and honeysuckle lingering long after the final page is turned.	2001-06-04

So I knew what to expect: beautifully concise language, lovely descriptions, and some insightful observations about the natural world and about life.  What struck me most about this book was its similarity to the nonfiction of Annie Dillard, another of my favorite writers who deal with both the natural world and the craft of writing.  Certain essays in this book reminded me of &quot;Teaching a Stone to Talk,&quot; which is another book remarkable for its economical prose.  I enjoyed learning some of Oliver's philosophies about the purpose of a writer, and I appreciated her observations about writers who inspired her, particularly Edna St. Vincent Millay and Walt Whitman.  She writes well about everything from owls to deer to poetry, and it all comes across as effortless and seamless (though she shows us that the process itself is anything but smooth).  I loved this book, although I would say that the best introduction to Mary Oliver is through her poetry: I recommend &quot;White Pine&quot; or &quot;Dream Work.&quot;  If you already like Mary Oliver, this book won't disappoint you!	2001-05-28

The magical nature of the story is compelling, and Calvino is a marvelous craftsman of fantasy.  The book does have some flaws: I had fundamental problems with Cosimo's reasons for going into the tree in the first place and deciding to remain there; it seemed to me that he spent his life in the trees out of sheer stubbornness.  This explanation, in the midst of a book that seemed to be trying to say something through Cosimo's wisdom, was unsatisfying for me.  But the scenes which deal with human relationships are stunning in their truth (if not their objective reality), and the arboreal world Calvino creates is one that I'd like to see.  One of my students recommended this book to me, and I am grateful to him for doing so.  I'm somewhat at a loss to compare this book with anything else I've ever read--but I do recommend it.	2001-05-07

It deals with everything from the natural history of deer to the animal rights movement to different approaches to hunting and management.  There's even a section that deals with the ways in which the film &quot;Bambi&quot; inextricably has altered Americans' views about deer.  Nelson is honest about his own biases and convictions; he tells us that he is a hunter and that he believes in a strict ethical code with regard to his own hunting, a belief he learned while working as a cultural anthropologist with the Koyukon Indians in northern Alaska.  Despite his strong beliefs, he is remarkably even-handed when dealing with the many controversial issues surrounding wildlife management in America today.  I understand much better now why animal rights activists and wilderness preservationists do not always make comfortable allies.  I trust this author; he has integrity.  I loved &quot;The Island Within&quot; for capturing the mist-ridden world of an island off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, and I loved this book every bit as much.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in deer, hunting, and the animal rights and environmental movements.  It is balanced, fair, and majestic.	2001-03-17

The prose is simple, the characters are vivid and colorful, and the stories have depth.  Chappell's style works best when the stories follow believable plot lines; his penchant for tall tales sometimes falls flat.  I especially could have done without the chapter entitled &quot;The Beard,&quot; even though I could see the metaphor Chappell was attempting to capture in that story.  Other than that, I thought the book was sincere, funny, and often breath-taking.  The finest moment for me was the chapter &quot;The Wish,&quot; which encapsulates everything I would like to say myself about life in the Southern Appalachians.  The book is worth reading just for that one chapter.  I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys the works of such writers as Tony Earley, Charles Frazier, Robert Morgan, Kaye Gibbons, and Wilma Dykeman, although Chappell is funnier than all of them.  Think a modern Mark Twain.	2001-01-31

Bobbie Ann Mason constructs a story well, and her characters behave as real people would. She rarely chooses to give the reader much of a sense of the landscapes in which she works, but when she does, she does it beautifully and economically. Frankly, though, I grew weary of the themes in her stories. In the middle of one of the stories, I think I screamed something like, &quot;If I have to read one more story about dysfunctional relationships, I'm going to shoot myself!&quot; I never did go through with it, in part because Mason does give the reader a taste of some likeable male characters in a few of the stories near the end of the book.  I myself would never want to write stories which are, ultimately, as bleak as the stories in this collection, but Mason's bitter humor is often endearing, and her characters are interesting (if similarly crafted from story to story).  If you want to read about people from rural Kentucky, read Wendell Berry instead; if you're looking for stories about relationships, read Joyce Carol Oates.  Save this one for after you're read just about everything else.	2001-01-03

Through dead-on dialogue in the vernacular speech of mountain people, Morgan puts the reader in the hollows and coves of upstate South Carolina and western North Carolina. Along the way he provides plenty of local history, which he gathers from his family's own oral history and from exhaustive research. Unfortunately, each of the three sections of the novel has major problems. The first novella, &quot;The Trace,&quot; is marred by some pathetically stereotyped depictions of the Cherokee Indians, who are portrayed as the aggressors in the struggle between themelves and the white settlers who moved into the area in the 1700s. &quot;The Road&quot; had potential to be a rollicking adventure story about a man who chases a pig through the mountains, but instead it becomes almost humorless, repetitive drudgery.  &quot;The Highway&quot; is the least memorable of all the stories: an awkward attempt to immortalize the men who built the first road through the mountains.  Although Morgan tries to foreshadow the ecological destruction which the roads will bring to the mountains, his narrative style instead depicts the natural world as hostile, needing to be tamed; in each story the main character is stalked almost constantly by a mountain lion (the word &quot;painter&quot; appears at least every few pages in the book, as if Morgan himself is proud that he knows this mountain mispronunciation). Surely this could have been accomplished in a more clever and creative manner.  On the whole, I found this book disappointing.  If you have not read Charles Frazier's &quot;Cold Mountain,&quot; read that one instead.	2001-01-03

He discusses everything from Japanese calligraphy to haiku to Zen to whalemeat, and even for the uninitiated, he makes these aspects of Japanese culture accessible.  His observations carry some real depth, too: he looks well beyond a tourist's superficial awe, well beyond an academic's obsession with paradigm.  In these essays Elder discovers what it is about bonsai trees, for example, that makes them uniquely Japanese, and he is able to articulate what their prevalence says about Japan's relationship to nature.  Without idealizing Japan, he leaves the reader with a greatly deepened understanding of a distinctly eastern view toward the natural world, and perhaps provides us--both Japanese and American--with new ways of seeing our human relationship to the environment.  This is an ambitious book, and a highly successful one.  I recommend it enthusiastically!	2000-11-12

Smith writes, &quot;The lightning flashes right then and I see her face and it is old, old.  It is older and meanern time.  Red Emmy stars me right in the eye and she spits one time on the rainy ground.&quot;  She weaves an interesting story that passes seamlessly from one generation to another.  The book has two major flaws, however.  One is that the ghost story of the Cantrell household, which continues as a thread from the beginning of the novel to the end, is never fully realized.  The other is that the book has a serious problem with voice.  The most convincing character in the story is Richard Burlage, a somewhat pathetic and naive schoolteacher from away who falls in love with a mountain girl.  Several of the mountain people speak in a voice that seems contrived and awkward, not at all natural in the way they tell their story.  At times Smith does herself a disservice by telling the story through so many different narrators.  Still, it is a well-informed, compelling story with many nice moments.	2000-10-17

Some have accused him of not being a Cherokee, or of renouncing his Native American heritage when it suited him, then exploiting it later in life.  There is also evidence that he was a speech writer for the Ku Klux Klan early in his career, before having a change of heart and writing the works for which he is better known.  Does this affect one's reading of this book?  That's a harder question.  I can say for sure, though, that this book is the real deal.  It is a deeply felt, honest (if occasionally idealized) account of what it meant to be raised Cherokee in the 1930's.  It describes beautifully the Great Smoky Mountains of eastern North Carolina, and it is a powerful argument for a return to some of the old ways of the indigenous people of the American Southeast.  Deeply moving, extremely humorous, and carefully told, this is one of America's greatest stories.  Treasure it, and read it again and again.	2000-09-29

Most burn brilliantly with the earthy essence of the  Southern Appalachians, and most are like kindling: they burn quickly.  His  poems are conversational and simple, and they deal with such subjects as  farming, lumbering, and ramblings through the forest.  They have  intellectual weight but are not self-referential, since Morgan writes about  real life in the mountains.  A lovely book, and an absolute bargain for  only two bucks--while other poets are asking fifteen dollars for volumes of  poetry of a similar length.  I woulnd't normally describe a book in  monetary terms, but this one is a great value.	2000-09-09

In some of these stories, the  metaphors and symbols Bass attempts to draw are lost on me--either too  bizarre or too obscure or too complex.  But there are some truly beautiful  moments here, particularly in the stories &quot;Antlers&quot; and  &quot;Fires.&quot;  Bass is most successful when his stories are deeply  rooted in a place he knows well, and when his plot lines are relatively  simple.  Both stories mentioned above deal centrally with human  relationships: fear and longing.  Set in a carefully wrought landscape (in  the case of these two stories, northwest Montana), the people and places  come alive in a way than few other writers (except maybe Wendell Berry) can  emulate.  I do recommend this book, but I would more enthusiastically  recommend some of Bass' nonfiction, especially &quot;Winter,&quot;  &quot;The Lost Grizzlies,&quot; and &quot;The Book of Yaak.&quot;  Also,  his book of short stories, &quot;Platte River,&quot; has some lovely  moments.

In this book she makes no really brilliant discoveries, which isn't  surprising given that she is a relative newcomer to the ranch life she  attempts to describe.

She spoke with local farmers and loggers,  visited libraries and newspaper offices, and read numerous accounts of the  history of the French Broad River bioregion.  The result is a very solid  history of the region, spiced with plenty of local color.  Although her  prose is at times dry, and although her attempts to include quotations and  jokes from local people sometimes come off as awkward, her fidelity to the  people who are the subjects of her book is unwavering, and she makes  numerous insights about the region's history and future which remain true  today.  The chapter, &quot;Who Killed the French Broad?&quot; is  particularly prophetic; no doubt Ms. Dykeman must be happy in her Newport,  Tennessee, home to see that the river runs cleaner than it did back in  1955, when the book was first published.

All are  set in the fictional town of Port William, Kentucky, and all confront  similar themes: death, honor, community.  The story &quot;Fidelity&quot; is  the most powerful, the story of a mountain man who, according to the most  rigid interpretation of the law, kidnaps his dying father from a hospital.

For years friends have been telling me that I needed to read &quot;No Exit,&quot; and finally I got around to it.  As advertised, it is a brilliantly executed portrayal of an existentialist Hell.  The dialogue is  clever and often humorous, and the play accomplishes what it sets out to  do.  But I simply cannot subscribe to Sartre's apparent belief that  &quot;Hell is other people.&quot;  I found myself bogged down by  existentialism's glum outlook on human relationships.

His strongest moments, particularly &quot;After the Flood&quot; and &quot;Settling Down,&quot; are where he  focuses on the fundamental idea of his book: the notion that the natural  world benefits from people who attach themselves to a place, who reject the  idea of &quot;moving on.&quot;  The chapters about the history of the Ohio  River valley are interesting and informative, and his personal memoirs are  worthwhile.  I did wonder at times why he insists on dealing with the  question of whether or not the world is ordered; it didn't seem to me to be  important to his main argument.  I also at times was overwhelmed and  bewildered by the far-flung sources from which he draws quotes: Thomas  Berry to Lao-tzu to Salman Rushdie to Wendell Berry.  Like John Elder,  Sanders suffers perhaps from being too well-read.  But if you like Elder's  books, or those of Thomas Berry, Ian Marshall, Scott Slovic, and Barry  Lopez, this one is well worth reading.  It's not too heavy, but meaty  anyway.	2000-05-22

Many of Hurston's sentences are breathtakingly beautiful, and  her prose is powerful without being caustic.  The main character, Janie,  undergoes a great transformation over the course of the novel, although  Hurston's stifling of Janie's voice does raise questions as to what extent  this is a feminist novel.  In many ways this book defies categorization,  although it is unquestionably a great book about the experience of the  African-American woman in the early 1900's.  It is a worthy book to teach  in a high school American history class, and the book is worthwhile reading  for those of us who missed it while Hurston's writing was mired in  obscurity.  Highly recommended.	2000-05-09

This book is Abbey at his best, showing that he can  write well about a landscape other than the American southwest.  He  describes the landscape of the Southern Appalachians in their stark  reality: the billboards and phony saloons of industrial tourism, the  abandoned stores and churches, the paved roads catering to the rich and  sedentary, the forsaken Cherokees.  His story is a truthful and  compassionate account of the tragedies of the region, as well as a powerful  argument that capitalism has failed.  This is not the place to start with  Abbey--&quot;Desert Solitaire&quot; or &quot;Abbey's Road&quot; would be a  better choice--but for those who are already familiar with him, this book  will not be a disappointment.	2000-04-11

The main character, Tayo, is caught between two worlds: the  world of violence and drunkenness into which many young Nativa Americans  plunged after the war; and the world of his ancestors, of stories and  ceremonies.  The book is not easy reading; I would hesitate to recommend it  for children or students under 15.  Although the language is simple, the  frequent time shifts and metaphors demand something from the reader.  This  is not a book to be read passively.  When read with the intent to savor  every passage, however, this book will take the reader far beyond the blame  game of red man versus white man, and into a world where a return to the  ancient ways of indigenous people just might save us from destroying  ourselves.	2000-04-09

Lamott is consistently skilled in her use of language, and every once in a while she writes a sentence that is truly astonishing in its beauty and insight.  She  constructs a plot that deals nicely with dilemmas of honesty and presents  it in a way that would make a great discussion starter for a group of  adolescents.  But the plot is otherwise strange: the scenes involving  Luther, the obsessive man in the bleachers who offers tips on how to  improve her game, are particularly unconvincing.  It isn't a particularly  ambitious novel, especially considering the trvial consequences she chooses  for her main character.

The mountains of South Carolina and North Carolina are wrought beautifully; Robert Morgan's status as the poet laureate of North Carolina is unquestioned.  He acptures well  the stark beauty of the landscape, as well as the pain of living in poverty  in the remote reaches of the mountains.  The simplicity of his language  sometimes gets in the way, though.  His use of &quot;I said&quot; and  &quot;Hank said&quot; throughout the story, without variety, becomes almost  unbearable.  Even more troubling is the glaring lack of character  development.  Julie Harmon's character is meant to represent a strong  southern woman, but she gives in to other people's wishes too often and is  too often silent to be credible.  Her husband, Hank, is barely crafted at  all.  He comes across as insensitive, unforgiving, brooding, and humorless,  but because there are a few instances which contradict this general  impression, it's difficult to tell if that is what Morgan intended.  The  characters are so lacking in substance, the reader starves.	2000-03-28

By combining painstaking research on local and Civil War history with stories passed to him within his own family, Frazier paints the parallel journeys of Inman and Ada in a beautiful style that rings  true.  The supporting characters--Ruby and Stodbrod and Veazie--have real  depth, and the landscape of the Southern Appalachians is rendered  lyrically.  Frazier teaches the reader the real tragedy of the Civil War  and how it affected the people of the South.  More importantly, he teaches  us how to stay put: how to live fully in one place, within a modern society  that devalues local knowledge and encourages people to move on in search of  better opportunity.  One might question Frazier's belief in the random  workings of the world--a decidedly atheist approach to his writing--but  this book is undoubtedly one of America's finest.	2000-03-14

Although his prose is at times tedious and repetitive,  the story itself is a fascinating one, and his determination to give  something back to the people of the region is admirable.  The story unfolds  in a way that allows the reader to understand what is happening to the  rainforest both culturally and ecologically, and it offers not merely a  criticism of western society but a set of reasonable solutions that could  benefit the region, not just ecologically but economically.  Plotkin is a  responsible researcher whose work should be a model for future  ethnobotanists.	2000-03-05

It was decades ahead of its time, and today it is considered by many to be the quintessential work of American environmental fiction.  &quot;The Bear&quot; is the  chapter most often mentioned in discussions about this novel, and  rightfully so: it makes some eloquently powerful statements about race,  honor, technology (even before the concept came into common usage), and  about humans' relationship to the land.  The prose is often difficult,  confusing, dense, and vague, but the rewards generally outweigh the hard  work needed to read this book.  For the most part, the other stories lack  the intensity and coherence of &quot;The Bear,&quot; but I found  &quot;Delta Autumn&quot; to be every bit as accessible and potent, and it  accomplishes this in a hundred fewer pages.  I recommend the book, although  I don't think it's necessary to read it in its entirety.  Stretch out in  front of a blazing fire on an old bearskin rug and let your mind drift back  a hundred years.	2000-02-02

Having spent some time  hitchhiking through the Australian Outback myself, I can say honestly that  Horwitz's observations about the people there are true.  I did find myself  amazed at his inability to find anything naturally beautiful except for  Uluru (Ayers Rock)--on numerous occasions he misses beautiful places  narrowly, in favor of the next pub or the next mining town, and ends up  claiming that the Outback connsists of nothing but barren plains and dry  lake beds.  Not entirely true.  But he certainly captures the essential  desperation and loneliness of the people of the Australian bush.  The book  is at times a little monotonous, but at least Horwitz knew enough to keep  his adventure short.  His observations are wry, a little condescending, and  usually perceptive.  Not a great work of literature, but an above-average  travel book and a must for anyone hitching through the Outback.	1999-11-16

This book, as much a character desription of grizzly expert Doug Peacock as it is a search for supposedly extinct grizzly bears in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado, is a great triumph.   The story is compelling, the language is beautiful, and the search itself  is important.  Truly, our attitude toward grizzly bears must be a direct  reflection of our attitude toward ourselves.  Although sometimes Bass gets  a little heavy-handed with his metaphors--we probably could figure out that  Doug Peacock has many grizzly-like traits without his coming out and  telling us--his plea for the protection and defense of grizzlies is  compelling, believeable, and genuine.  A wonderful read.	1999-11-09

Other nature  writers--Edward Abbey, for example--have been known to take liberties with  the exact details of the stories they tell, but Lopez actually creates new  worlds in this collection of short fiction pieces.  At his best, in stories  such as &quot;Teal Creek&quot; and &quot;Sonora,&quot; Lopez lets the story  itself convey whatever larger purposes he might have.  In his less  successful pieces (&quot;Conversation&quot;), he beats the reader over the  head with political psychobabble, almost to the point of sounding like  propaganda.  However, his ability to tell a story is undeniable, and it  would be hard to argue with his place-based approach to environmentalism.   And Lopez himself would be the first to say that it is the story itself,  and not the moral of the story, that mattters.	1999-10-31
US	51052638	R1G8HGJZ49OHN4	0375703055	220076440	Ellen Foster	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Bone meets Holden Caulfield	Ellen Foster is a character in the tradition of Dorothy Allison's &quot;Bastard Out of Carolina&quot; and Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the  Rye.&quot;  Kaye Gibbons' approach, to write entirely in the voice of her  main character, serves the book's purpose well.  Although Ellen's voice  sometimes makes her storytelling confusing and vague, especially early in  the novel, the book is often beautifully wrought and subtle.  It is  sometimes humorous, often heartbreaking, and simply written.  A nice  compliment to Salinger's overwrought prose and Allison's brutal  forthrightness.  This book ranks right up there with those other two works  and in fact is probably better suited for high-school age readers than  either.  Not perfect, but well worth the read.	1999-10-27

This book was a great achievement in that it was really the first work of American nature writing, and Bartram made a lot of great botanical discoveries during his  journeys through the American Southeast.  But his language is  excruciatingly tedious.  He uses ten pages to express what probably could  be said in a single paragraph, and he often will offer two choices or  options, when one would suffice: &quot;We encamped on a high cliff or  bluff...&quot;  And although he makes some interesting observations about  the Cherokees, Creeks, and Seminoles, his views are often distressingly  unenlightened or idealized.  Although I love nature writing, and although I  love the works of Thoreau, who came just a half-century later, I found  Bartram's book painful to get through.	1999-10-08

Annie Proulx fully captures the tortured emotions of her main character, Quoyle, as he moves back to his family's native Newfoundland.  It is a richly wrought, beautifully captured story of love lost, of making  a home in an inhospitable place, of finding solace.  Proulx's eye for  detail works so well with her economy of words, and her prose reflects the  environment in which the story is set.  A remarkable book.	1999-08-25
