Dirk has matured since this adventure. There is a lot more booze drinking and Dirk even reaches for his cigarettes! Perhaps a sign of the times the book was written? However, the excitement and plot development is awesome.  It shows, no proves, Cussler had the talent from the beginning.	2005-01-10

Global warming, or commonly referred to as the greenhouse effect (which in my opinion is a poor term as it refers to a nice warm greenhouse environment.  I'd rather see it called \\"Inside the four door AMC Gremlin with the windows rolled up on a 90 degree day effect\\").  Anyway, the story is very weak.  Chricton made an attempt to present facts in story form and if you read the final pages you will get the gist of his point, which is made well THERE. The information he has presented here has swayed my former opinion or belief that global warming is primarily caused by human consumption of fossil fuels.  Although he does not deny taht this does have an impact, he presents well documented information that increasing temperatures and receding glaciers is NOT happening everywhere.  This is akin to the media telling the worst of stories and leaving the positive stories aside.  As for the story, it is weak, the characters are developed well but I cared for none of them, and they survived unbelievable hazards and attacks without any rest or recovery.  If this were a Clive Cussler novel I'd go along with it, but the action is forced just to present the information at hand.	2005-01-05

I am a teacher of geology and was excited as to the prospect of a fiction book on topics of geology. I have tried three of Du Brul's books and never finished one. The whisky guzzling and sly humor(?) was too much.  There is little character development in terms of getting an idea of what the person is all about, and the narrow escapes are just too much This coming from an avid Clive Cussler Fan!.	2004-11-23

This book is necessary to really feel what the characters are feeling, and that is what this second book in the series brings.  I still could not put it down, but the excitement was slightly less that Winter King, like the middle child, but I was rewarded for my time with Excalibur.

I decided to read the other one first, then I forgot all about Blue Latitudes. Long story short... I wish I never waited this long.  This book akin to Bill Bryson's travel/history books,  but Tony Horwitz has his own flavor of telling the story of fact through humor and excellent story telling. I have recommended and purchased copies for others who have enjoyed it as well. A wonderful documentary of an adventure of a respectable life.  I learned to know and love who Capt. Cook was and appreciate the pressures he was under.  He made good and bad decisions, but maintained respect all along. I always understood Captain Cook as a pirate. I wish the REAL stories could be taught in school as he deserves much more respect than Columbus, who in many ways led a DISrespectable life.   Very well written, documented, full of life and often hilarious as seen through the experiences that Tony Horwitz went through to capture the essence and depth of the story behind the life of Captain Cook.  At many times I felt like it was a fiction as Tony shares the discoveries behind Cook's life and you visualize the scene as if you were there too.  You will not be disappointed in this book.  Enjoy!  Share!	2004-11-23

I was on a 9 month internship to England in 1980.  The visit to Stonehenge was at the very top of my experience list.  Ever since I was interested in reading everything about it.  Most information is non-fiction and latest news about archeological discoveries.  As an avid reader of historical fiction, I found Stonehenge by Bernard Cornwell.  Great story, great character development, the anticipation for the construction of the monolith was immense, the story was captivating. I have looked for more historical fiction on Stonehenge, however, I fear none could do it better than Bernard Cornwell. I have continued reading his historical fiction, including the Arthur Series wich is excellent.	2004-11-23

I have read most college level textbooks of anthropology, most factual books of paleoanthropology from Ian Tattersall and the rest, and most works of fiction on the subject ranging from Jane Aeul's series to Petru Propescu's \\"Almost Adam\\". It was in a dry spell, as I had consumed all there was, that I found Robert J. Sawyer's \\"Hominids\\". Normally, I tend to stay away from science fiction, but, a Neanderthal Parallax? I had to give this one a chance.<BR>Hominids was a feast for my eyes, my mind, my heart, and my humanity. It raises compelling questions about our human condition from a very outside and an rational perspective. It is well researched, which is a requirement for a good anthropological fiction in my mind. Aeul explored the caves in France, but, Sawyer MET with Tattersall!!!<BR>The second book of the trilogy \\"Humans\\" was good. I have never waited for a book with such anticipation. I felt like a boy with my first new bike, the anticipation to ride so very exciting, yet a challenging aspect about it causes me to hesitate and take it step my step, so when I have conquered it I will experience the thrill and absorb the accomplishment just to prepare myself for the next level.  I was only hoping for more about the anthropomorphic life of the Neanderthal, and less about the romance. <BR>The third book in the trilogy: \\"Hybrids\\" has already been pre-ordered. This trilogy is still by far the best I have ever read, and I have read many.	2003-05-23

Sawyer, writer of my favorites in paleoanthropological fiction: \\"Hominids\\", \\"Humans\\" and, coming soon, the third in the Neanderthal Parralox Trilogy; \\"Hybrids\\".  I was not disappointed!<br />Evolution takes you on a tour through the evolution of humans that is so realistic, its hard to believe it isn't fact. So realistic is it that you only know it isn't historical fact when you close the book.   Each and every organism is given an appealing persona with anthropomorphic ties to today's Homo sapien sapiens.  Instantly, the reader develops a feeling for and understanding of each character and is with them every step of the way, confronting every challenge, the characters themselves becoming woven into the fabric of the reader's humanity. To add color, throughout the entire book many of the organisms from the past chapters are often referred to, giving the book a world of continuity in human development.<br />This book is now proudly placed right next to Sawyer's Neanderthal Parralox Trilogy, among my favorites in paleoanthropological fiction.<br />Highly Recommended!	2003-05-23
