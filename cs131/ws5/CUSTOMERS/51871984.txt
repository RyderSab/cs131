The world has  not stood still in the years since we took up arms for what we deemed our  most invaluable right - that of self-government. We now enjoy the rare  privilege of seeing what we fought for in the retrospect. It no longer  seems so desirable. It would now prove only a curse. We have good cause to  thank God for our escape from it, not alone for our sake, but for that of  the whole country and even of the world.&quot; Mr. Bonekemper's fine book  tells of a failed generalship, whose defenders omit that General Robert E.  Lee lacked a master strategy of how to win the war. A war, in which, he  personally took to the North. A war, where in he never recover a square  foot of the Commonwealth of Virginia from the North, ie., Hampton (Fort  Ward remainded a Union Fort throughout the war),  let alone Alexandria,  Virginia, his home.  For a war that lasted four years, killing off  thousands of young Southern males, to cover such a lost, some hope to cover  that terribly lost by enshiring a false icon.

McDonald, Ph.D. ...In the 1990s scholars, military historians, popular historians, and military eye-witnesses can tell their stories at a remove from a war that seemed as present in the United States as it was on any for-eign soil. Finally, even the quiet university campuses seem ready to listen, as men like Jimmy Bryant tell it \\"like it was.\\" Born in North Carolina, Jimmy Bryant was raised on a farm in the tobacco belt. He joined the US Navy in 1954 at the age of 18. After recruit training in San Diego, he served on six US Navy ships at sea; he had two shore duty assign-ments. His second ship was the USS Boxer CVS-21, con-verted to LPH-4, which was involved in the Nuclear Test Series of 1958 in the Pacific. His memoir covers his tour in Vietnam with River Division 591. While on active duty in Vietnam, Bryant is credited with 38 contacts with the enemy in which shots were fired. Often he stood, clearly exposed to enemy fire. His Bronze Star Medal, with Combat \\"V,\\" from the year 1970 is made out to \\"Chief Signalman Jimmy R. Bryant, United States Navy, for Meritorious Service from October 1968 to September 1969.\\" (Vice Admiral E.R. Zumwalt, Jr., Commander of US Naval Forces in Vietnam spells out Chief Bryant's acts of heroism) Bryant, after recov-ering from injuries received in Vietnam, finished up his last tour as Company Commander at the Naval Air Technical Training Center in Millington, Tennessee.  Jimmy Bryant's memoir begins in October, 1968, the year of the Tet Offensive. (In January of that year, there was a combined assault on US positions by the NVA (North Vietnam Army) and the Viet Cong. Between Tet and his ar-rival in Saigon, Chief Bryant was stationed aboard the USS Hummingbird MSC-192, a coastal minesweeper out of Little Creek, Va. The Navy circulated a Major Call, a memoran-dum, looking for qualified men to join the River Patrol Force in Vietnam. Of this Force, Lt. Col. Victor Croizat has writ-ten: \\"(It was created) in September 1965 to patrol island wa-terways, to deny them to communist insurgents and enforce the curfew. The US Navy River Patrol Force, code name `Game Warden', was designated Task Force 116 and placed under the naval component of the US Military Assistance Command, Vietnam\\" (Brown Water Navy, 142). In 1968 Bryant volunteered to join the River Patrol Force, and after a few weeks received orders to proceed for PBR (=patrol boat, river) training at Vallejo, California. After his unit had fa-miliarized itself with the relevant boats, weapons and tactics, Bryant was sent to Whidbey Island, Washington, for survival training. This was followed by Vietnamese language training in San Diego. In late 1968, aircraft then brought the future brown water sailors to Vietnam, by way of Alaska and Japan. Bryant's manuscript begins upon his arrival in Saigon. It ends in 1969, the year in which President Nixon had begun a slow withdrawal of US ground troops from Vietnam.  By sheer coincidence Jimmy Bryant's memoir appears very close in time to the comprehensive book by Gordon L.  Rottman, The Vietnam Brown Water Navy: Riverine and Coastal Warfare 1965-69 (1997). Rottman begins by re-minding us that the Mekong Delta is the world's largest river delta. \\"The Delta's real roads are its waterways,\\" he contin-ues, \\"with sampans the main mode of transportation. Even villages were either floating, built on stilts, or with individual homes on earth mounds. Malaria and dengue fever is ram-pant year around as are leeches, poisonous snakes, and vi-cious ants. The water is unfit to drink. During the dry sea-son, December to March, salt water intrudes 20-50 miles inland up the waterways. The April to November wet, or monsoon season, brings over eighty inches of rain. Tem-peratures are in the 80-100F range with equally high humid-ity. Soldiers on foot in the Delta were exhausted after three days in the field and required at least two days to recover from constantly wet feet. Longer duration operations led to immersionfoot, rashes and skin ulcers\\" (4).  Since the earliest times riverine and coastal warfare had long been practiced in the Vietnam Delta--by the ancient Vietnamese, Chinese, Khmers, and the modern French navy. In 1965, because of a deteriorating military situation, the US military decided to commit an American riverine force to the Delta. Army and Navy joined troops, and worked together, to develop the Mobile Riverine Force, whose mission was to interdict the flow of men and materials to the enemy. The Force started to dissolve in the summer of 1969, Rottman says, as US forces began the withdrawal from Vietnam (4).  The role of the US Navy was to patrol the many rivers in small boats that could travel the waterways at high speeds, using hit-and-run tactics to disrupt the flow of enemy troops and supplies and to inflict as much damage as possible. The site of action was a small fiberglass boat, and the dominant weapon was the Browning .50-caliber HB-M2 machine gun. Bryant belonged to one of the better-known operations of the Vietnam Brown Water Navy, Task Force 116 (Operation GAME WARDEN), the River Patrol Force. Activated in De-cember, 1965, Task Force 116 underwent several permuta-tions, being enlarged in 1968--the year that Bryant arrived in Vietnam--to four task groups assigned to specific rivers (Rottman, 5).  The first Game Warden PBRs were operational in Spring, 1966; the boats were based on the Long Tau ship channel, Nha Be and at Cat Lo, near Vung Tau.  (The Long Tau channel connects three rivers: the Saigon, the Nha Be and the Long Tau.) Speaking of the PBR, the most frequently observed patrol craft in the Mekong Delta, Alan L. \\"Buz\\" Lowe observes: \\"The PBR came to symbolize the Brown Water Navy in Vietnam. When the US Navy decided to commit river patrol forces, it found itself in need of a small, fast vessel that could maneuver in tight places. The Navy decided to use a 31-foot craft capable of 28 knots. The boat's armament consisted of a twin .50 caliber-machinegun turret in the bow, a single .50 caliber machine gun in the stern, and an M-60 machine gun and a Mark 18 40mm grenade launcher mounted amidships. Because its armor was limited, speed and armament became the PBR's best hope for pro-tection. The PBR was born in an atmosphere of urgency and tested under actual combat conditions...\\" (12). Task Force 116 reached a peak strength of 258 craft, supported by air-craft and helicopters. Rottman makes the point that, \\"of the fourteen Medals of Honor awarded to Navy personnel in the Vietnam War, three were awarded to two PBR crewmen, one posthumously, and a river assault officer\\" (5). This was a task force of heroes.  Jimmy Bryant and men like him would not want to be put on a pedestal, however. \\"Salty,\\" Rottman says, \\"is per-haps the best word to describe America's brown water sail-ors. Serving long days aboard small craft with few comfort amenities, distant from desk-bound officers, they viewed themselves as free-wheeling and independent from the spit and polish of the `big ship Navy'\\" (16). Some wore Vietnam-ese black pajamas, the same as their Vietnamese crewmen. Warriors who didn't stand on ceremony--these were the seamen of the Brown Water Navy. They inhabited a world of mobile bases, patrolling, speed, searching out the enemy, and lightning-reaction ingenuity. The man who adapted and improvised, lived to tell his story.  Tom Hain explains on his informative web page, up since 1996, \\"The Mobile Riverine Force\\", that \\"the tactics we used were developed on the job,\\" because there hadn't been a need for a force like the MRF since the Civil War. The degree of coop-eration between Army and Navy also recalls Civil War times. In Hain's view, the terrain of combat was decisive. The Viet-nam delta, he reminds us, \\"was laced with waterways, natural and man made. You couldn't dig a hole more than 2 feet deep without hitting water. The bad guys used the waterways too.\\" On these dangerous waterways Jimmy Bryant operated, and every inch of brown water, or so it would appear, turned into a kill zone.  The Riverine forces, the subject of. Commander Don Sheppard's best-selling book, Riverine: A Brown-Water Sailor In The Delta, 1967 (1992), took the fight to the enemy under the motto \\"Close and Kill.\\" The men who fought the so-called River War, volunteers from the fleet, relied on strategy and teamwork. Each operation required an orchestration of various units, both water and ground; air support figured in, as well.  The task of the mobile riverine operation was tactical, rewarding daring, speed, and the surprise of the night am-bush. Each four-man crew faced the danger of sorties into unknown territory, as the fragile boats navigated the muddy, unpredictable rivers. They accepted a tight living space that was damp, dusty and noisy; there was precious little privacy. Weather was always a factor, sometimes a major inhibiting factor. (It is estimated that weather, for example, monsoon rains, restricted PBR operations up to half of the time, espe-cially early in the River War.)	1998-09-07

Bryant, USN Man of the River is a highly personal account of a man's Naval experiences in Vietnam's rivers from 1968 to 1969.  In his dedication Bryant made sure to stress that this is not an individual's war story but one of a team.  He shows his pride and respect for his fellow &quot;men of the sea&quot; in Task Force 116, River division 591.  It is to these brave men whom he dedicates this book.  While on active duty he is credited with 38 accounts of enemy contact with his fellow patrolmen.  The role of the Navy in Vietnam's waterways was to patrol the rivers in high-speed small boats using hit-and-run tactics to disrupt the flow of enemy troops and supplies. The threat of combat was always with them, and Bryant soon realized that fear was not an option if he were to keep his men alive.  His whole task force knew that one false move could be death for them all, and Bryant with great pride tells of how each member kept a cool head throughout with their own bravery and the grace of God.  Bryant's straightforward and detailed account was not written for personal glory but from thankfulness for surviving to be able to tell his story in respect and remembrance of all those who fought honorably for the American ideal.	1998-09-07

That unit, Bravo  Company, 3rd Battalion, 22nd Infantry,  25th Infantry Division, was  commanded at the time by Captain Robert Hemphill, now Lieutenant Colonel,  Retired. Colonel Hemphill considers Platoon to be its director's own  interpretation of events which occurred in his Infantry company. However,  since the line infantryman is not normally privy to the thoughts and  actions of the commander or of the overall scheme of combat activities,  much of his story is speculation or sheer imagination. Nevertheless, this  film, and other sensationalist movies like it, have been very influential  in shaping American - and world - public opinion concerning the conduct and  accomplishments of the American soldier in Vietnam. Based on Platoon and  his other Vietnam-related movies, this director apparently views the  average American soldier in Vietnam as a cruel, racist, pot-headed  malcontent. <br />Hemphill says that this is a serious misinterpretation. He  found the Vietnam combat infantryman to be like American combat soldiers  everywhere: some were very good, some not so good, but most took their job  and service seriously and did the best they could with what they were given  to do. While isolated incidents of indiscretion did occur and were  voraciously reported in the media, the vast majority of frontline  infantrymen were not habitual dopers, did not commit atrocities, did not  hunt down their fellow soldiers and were not psychotic killers. In contrast  to many depictions of the Vietnam combat soldier, this book represents him  as he really was, particularly during the time of Colonel Hemphill's tour  of duty as Bravo Six: profane, yes, but honorable in the performance of his  duty.<br />Robert L. Hemphill grew up in Georgia, graduating from the  University of Georgia with a B.A. in Political Science in 1964. He served  in the U.S. Army from 1964 to 1989, retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel of  Infantry, receiving a Silver Star (for Gallantry in Action), Bronze Stars  with \\"Vs\\" (for Valor in Ground Combat - 4 awards), a Purple Heart (for  Combat Wounds) and several other citations and awards. He served two years  in Vietnam. Hemphill completed an M.A. in International Relations at Johns  Hopkins University in 1973. He is a much sought-after speaker  at veterans'  organizations and teaches English and Civics part-time. Hemphill currently  lives in Northern Virginia with his family.

Richard Barksdale Harwell Author of In Tall Cotton  As listed in In Tall Cotton: [This is] a fictional treatment of Harris' early teen-age years as printer's devil for The Countryman, a remarkable country paper roughly modeled after The Spectator that was published during the war years by Joseph Addison Turner at Turnwold Plantation near Eatonton, Georgia.       Harris dedicated On the Plantation to Turner and says in an &quot;Introductory Note&quot;: &quot;Some of my friends who have read in serial form the chronicles that follow profess to find in them something more than an autobiographical touch. Be it so. It would indeed be difficult to invest the commonplace character of Joe Maxwell [i.e., Harris] with the vitality that belongs to fiction. Nevertheless, the lad himself, and the events which are herein described, seem to have been born of a dream. That which is fiction pure and simple in these pages bears to me a stamp of truth, and that which is true reads like a clumsy invention. In this matter it is not for me to prompt the reader. He must sift the fact from the fiction and label it to suit himself.&quot	1997-09-20

Hamlin's rare 1896 work, originally entitled The Battle of Chancellorsvile: The Attack of Stonewall Jackson..., gives it the status of a classic. The following two paragraphs are taken directly from O'Reilly's opening introduction: In the early morning of May 2, 1863, a small cavalcade of Federal horsemen galloped out the Orange Plank Road. At the head of the group, &quot;...with the air of a king, very red in the face, but holding his big fat body very erect,&quot; rode the commander of the Army of the Potomac, Major General Joseph Hooker. Close behind him cantered the one-arm nascent leader of the Union Eleventh Corps, Major General Oliver Otis Howard. Merry staff officers bantered and teased while the generals glanced over their defenses. After a short look, Hooker voiced his satisfaction with the Eleventh Corps position and returned to Chancellorsville to consummate his mysterious plans for victory over Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Nine hours later, the soldiers of the Eleventh Corps sat stoically manning their trenches or cooking dinner and listening to the sweet refrains of musicians in the distance. They also heard rumors that the Confederates had abandoned the battlefield and now hurried to escape the Federals' clutches. &quot;Unharness those horses, boys, give them a good feed of oats,&quot; laughed General O.O. Howard. &quot;We will be off for Richmond at daylight.&quot; Suddenly, a startled deer bolted from the forest, barreling through the astonished soldiers. Other deer darted from the woods, pursued by rabbits, foxes and birds scurrying in every direction. All nature had gone awry. Driving the wildlife before them came the cadenced ranks of Lieutenant General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson's Confederates. The gray-clad Southerners plowed into the Union defenses &quot;...like a crash of thunder from the clear sky.&quot;  Introduction by Frank O'Reilly is a graduate of, and guest lecturer at, Washington &amp; Lee University. He has written widely on the war along the Rappahannock, and is the author of introductions to new editions of Phil Sheridan's memoirs and the history of the First Massachusetts Cavalry. An authority on Stonewall Jackson, O'Reilly is the author of Stonewall Jackson at Fredericksburg, co-author of the Atlas of the Civil War and is researching a book on the Chancellorsville Campaign.

Books	5	6	7	N	N	A interesting look inside the Federal Capital during the CW	Here's just three sample reviews of this fine text and outstanding 2by3' map...    &quot;Following his book, The Story The Soldier's Wouldn't Tell, about sex during the Civil War, Tom Lowry focuses here on a ... small area of central Washington, DC during the Civil War. Close to the heart of government lay this hot bed of vice and prostitution, catering largely to the military. Fascinating reading.&quot;   John Bancroft, M.D., Director, Kinsey Institute, Indiana University     &quot;With this book on the bordellos of Washington, D.C., during the Civil War, Lowry has presented insights into a previously neglected aspect of the great conflict, which touched not only active-duty soldiers but also long-retired veterans. The usual description of 1861-1865 Washington portrays muddy roads, confusion, and men hurrying along the streets. Now we know where ... some of them were going!&quot;   Jack D. Welsh, M.D., Author of Medical Histories of Union Generals  &quot;A concise, open-minded, and lucid look at the vice district of Mr. Lincoln's City, where even the pressure of war could not change the hierarchies of power and the ordering of class, of race, and of gender. This is a scholar's illuminating look at the difficult questions about America's future which emerged in those sin-sodden streets. Future studies of this neglected subject will have a difficult time matching Dr. Tom Lowry's compassion, coherence, and class.&quot;   Benedict R.
