There are authors who seem to lose some spark when they write a series of books like Ms Gabaldon's. This author manages to keep the characters fresh and one looks forward to seeing their progression. I like the theme of A Breath of Snow and Ashes; the lead-up to the American Revolution is so interesting, the pivotal part of our history. I look forward to the next installment (please, Ms. Gabaldon!).<br /><br />My only thought of this book, not even a criticism, is I wish the author would refresh our memory with recurring characters as they appear. I found myself distracted by trying to remember who was who and what was what. I have read all the books, but I read a lot of books and do not remember details of past reads.<br /><br />I loved this book and the whole series!	2005-10-12

Other reviewers have praised Moloka'i much better than I can, but I want to give it my 5 stars. I've been fortunate to have visited Moloka'i a couple of times, and have stood on the pali overlooking Kalaupapa thinking of those souls who had to spend their lives on that beautiful but isolated place. Rachel Kalama embodies the spirit of the Hawaiian people; those who love life, family, the land and the ocean.	2005-09-10

I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Goldberg's previous books, and his \\"100 People\\" is just as interesting. He must have hit many raw nerves since he was recently bushwhacked on a recent small-time t.v. show by five far, far left extremists who didn't even give him a chance to speak. Like Mr. Goldberg, I remember when the \\"Big 3\\" networks controlled the slant of the news and are now yelling unfair with so many radio and t.v. stations presenting differing views of the world. Many of his \\"picks\\", some of whom I was not familiar with, have contributed to the decline of decency and morality in our society, and I certainly agree with his #1!	2005-07-24

Anyway, I did read the book and didn't learn much new about our former co-president and current senator. It did reaffirm my opinion that if Hillary is ever elected president, WATCH OUT! With the Clintons it's all about power and control. It's all \\"about the children\\", a worn phrase that has worked well for them.

I've read all of Edward Rutherfurd's books, and The Princes of Ireland is as engrossing and interesting as any of them. Mixing history with fiction is the author's forte, much as James Michener did, and if one wants to rush or skim through his books, much is lost. This book covers Ireland from the 900s AD thru the 1500s AD, with a comprehensive grasp of the tribes who settled the island, England's influence and attempted dominance, and how the Catholic Church was a large part of its history. I highly recommend!	2005-05-04

Then I began to be bored with a very familiar plot and that's when I began skimming through the rest. Jessie Sullivan's dalliance with Brother Thomas was very predictable, and I thought the reasoning behind her mother chopping off her fingers was rather far-fetched.

I've watched many presidential press secretaries, and never envied their position. The press is critical to our democracy, but why do they continue to ask the same question over and over with different verbiage when it's apparent that they are not going to hear the answer they want. Mr. Fleischer doesn't have an answer for that either, but for an insider's view of history being made, I highly recommend Taking Heat.<br /><br />Mr. Fleischer is not the first to point out the left-leaning tendencies of the press, and this is from a man who was raised a New York Democrat! The major media and newspapers deny it, but it's so subtle and obvious that it seems to go over their heads. Anyway, I was looking forward to reading Taking Heat and was not disappointed.	2005-03-13

I was caught up on page one and my interest never lagged. I remember the 1960s but had forgotten how different society was, and I was a military (USAF) wife for 10 years and could certainly relate to base (station) living. Most of the story is seen through the eyes of 8-year old Madeline McCarthy, later an adult, and I'd love to know how the rest of her life is going.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to all I know, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves being caught up in a wonderful story.	2005-02-26

Joel Backman is not a hero-type protagonist; he has a spotted past but jail time has shifted his priorities. Mr. Grisham's descriptions of Italy gave me wanderlust, although I could have done with a little less of the detailed language lessons.

I enjoyed reading a story from the prospective of Simon St. James and Deborah and I became totally involved in the story and its twists and turns.

I bought this book this morning, started it this afternoon and it is now early evening and I just finished it. I will be passing this book on to my three daughters. Carmen bin Ladin, half Swiss and half Persian, tells a love story of herself as an independent European woman falling in love with Yeslam bin Ladin, a half-brother to the infamous Osama.<br /><br />Carmen is accustomed to living in Europe, mainly Switzerland, and she and her husband also spend time in California. Family matters take them back to Saudi Arabia where she is always an outsider and a foreigner. Life really begins to change in 1979 when Saudi Arabia begins to turn back to the strict rules of Wahabi Islam after the overthrow of the Shah of Iran. Life for women and all females becomes even more oppressive, to put it mildly.<br /><br />I once worked in a bank where one of the many Saudi Princes had his accounts while attending college in Calif. His free spending habits and the arrogance of his groupies was mind-boggling. Carmen bin Ladin tells of the exhorbitant wealth of the royals and some of the decadence.<br /><br />The author's struggle to raise her three daughters as independent, educated thinkers and her crumbling marriage against the backdrop of the bin Ladin family is a wonderful read.	2004-08-01

I would recommend one read The Notes, which comprise a good part of the book, to understand who said what and when.<br />Besides the sexual escapades of Commander-In-Chief Clinton (which would result in court martials for his military subordinates), Mr. Lowry describes President Clinton's aversion to any confrontation which would damage what he believes was his national and international image and mar his \\"legacy.\\" His charisma and ability to say exactly what people wanted to hear blinded so many to his inability to lead, most notably when global terrorists began attacking the U.S, i.e., USS Cole, Khobar Towers, Somolia, World Trade Center, etc. Due to his disdain of the military and enforcement authorities, the FBI, CIA and mililtary had their budgets and personnel slashed, and our intelligence community suffered and had their priorities changed to global environmental issues and other avenues that had nothing to do with national security. Mr. Lowry tells of the FBI head, Louis Freeh, not having a direct meeting with the President for 4 years! Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden knew all this, of course, and didn't hesitate to take advantage and wreak their havoc.<br />President and Mrs. Clinton rode a wave of prosperity for which they took full credit that had its beginning long before they took office, and the bubble starting collapsing at least 18 months before they left office. I can personally attest to that from my own personal meager portfolio.<br />Mr. Lowry has drawn a timeline of events that eventually leads to 9/11/01, and I have a much broader understanding of the reasons we are presently in Iraq. I would highly recommend this book to any Americans who care to understand why we are where we are. Mr. Clinton was so concerned with leaving a \\"Legacy\\", but we will pay for his \\"Legacy\\" for many years to come.	2003-11-19

I've always like Michener's style of going back in time and following through to the present. I've been fortunate in visiting Hawaii many times, and although Hawaii's characters are fiction, the history of the Islands gives me a better understanding of our 50th state. And, it's just one great read! I wore out two paperbacks of this book (between myself and lending them), and recently ordered another.	2003-08-19
