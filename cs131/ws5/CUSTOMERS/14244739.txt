Walter Isaacson could not pick a more fascinating person to write about, nor more interesting events.  In his \\"pragmatic\\" approach to life, Benjamin Franklin became one of society's top diplomats, scientists, inventors, statesman, and journalists (I wouldn't really refer to him as a philosopher, as some do).  His plethora of pithy maxims and practical inventions are truly remarkable, all the more incredible given Franklin's Founding Father status.  As Isaacson points out, Franklin was the only person who signed the Declaration of Independence, Treaties with England and France to end the Revolutionary War, and U.S. Constitution.    Isaacson also aptly describes Franklin's imperfections.  He virtually abandoned his wife and children by spending a great deal of time in Europe, half of that time on rather frivolous pursuits.  He loved to flirt with women, often much younger than himself, in a fashion that would certainly be highly frowned upon today.  Additionally, Franklin was pro-England for longer than any of the other great men that founded our country, and later fell in love (almost embarassingly so) with France.    With warts and all though, Isaacson successfully demonstrates the influence of Franklin's views regarding the virtues of democracy in general, and the tradesmen middle class in particular.  Unlike the other Founding Fathers, he had an unadulterated faith in the common man, and a distrust of the elite, and also managed to invent the lightening rod and bifocals along the way.    One of my favorite parts of the book is the last chapter, where Isaacson describes the evolution of different attitudes towards Benjamin Franklin.  Basically, more pragmatic eras admire him, while more romantic eras don't.  I would think that it would be fair to say that, presently, Franklin has been elevatedto Demi-God Founding Father status, together with Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, and perhaps a few others.    I have the same quibbles as some of the other reviewers.  I believe the book is about 50 pages longer than it need be.  It's not necessary for the author to repeatedly tell us about Franklin's views on religious tolerance, for instance.  The multiple descriptions of his flirtatious affairs with some of the women in France seem endless at times.  Also, I believe Isaacson sometimes overstates Franklin's importance in forming the nation's governmental form, although his leadership in securing France's cooperation with the colonies during the Revolutionary War cannot be questioned.  I rather doubt that he was so important to the Constitutional Compromise, though he might have occasionally smoothed over rough waters (as he liked to do with a \\"magic\\" wand which would release oil to calm a choppy lake).    Still, \\"Benjamin Franklin - An American Life,\\" is well worth the read, and should be part of any decent library containing biographies of important Americans.  Also, check out the Amazon review by Newt Gingrich.  He's a good writer, and I sort of miss his presence in Congress, even though he's politically well to the right of me.	2005-10-09

To me, Olds is basically a slightly more literate Danielle Steele.  I don't like to stereotype, but one can't deny that a gender difference exists when it comes to certain types of books.    I knew I was in trouble when all of the men were big-shouldered, free spirited and taciturn; and the women attractive, sensitive and complicated.  Olds also includes lots of dogs and horses, all referred to by first names, and with distinct personalities -- always a bad sign.  Sentimental scenes include a good-humoured nine year old boy, born with a stump instead of an arm, who succeeds as a little league pitcher.

David Schickler's \\"Kissing In Manhattan\\" cannot be categorized as either a collection of independent short stories or a novel.  Rather, the 11 \\"vignettes\\" consist of various characters with intertwined lives and destinies, centered around a gothic Manhattan upper-west side apartment building, known as the \\"Preemption\\" (surely a play on \\"redemption\\").  The Preemption possesses a preternatural quality, with its mysterious absentee landlord/owner, ageless and far-seeing doorman Sender, the oldest working elevator in New York (with its Mahogany wood interior), and freestanding bathtubs (which plays prominently in the second story, \\"Jacob's Bath\\").    The book centers around two main characters who happen to be roommates: The predatory Patrick Rigg, who, in his attempt to escape his distress over a childhood tragedy, enjoys variations of body worship and bondage of gorgeous women; and the introspective shy James Branch, a stutterer as a child, who has little self-confidence, and often withdraws into his own little world. (Based on part of the author's description of him, I thought he might be slightly autistic).  In one way or another, all of the other characters are, or become, connected to these two.  I thought that the Rigg/Branch contrast demonstrated the Yin/Yang of a typical male as viewed by the author.  As one might expect though, both Rigg and Branch perhaps have more in common than meets the eye.    I enjoyed \\"Kissing In Manhattan,\\" and read it very quickly.  Since characters are often re-introduced in the various stories, I often found myself flipping back through pages in an attempt to keep track of where I had encountered that particular person before. My main beef with the book is that almost all of the female characters (most of whom are beautiful and intelligent), seem to secretly desire submitting to a domineering man who, in the case of Patrick, wants to tie them up (there are a few exceptions).  In the first story, \\"Checkers and Donna,\\" for instance, beautiful intelligent Donna, who could have her \\"pick of the litter,\\" eventually falls for a ultra-obnoxious guy (Checkers), who wins her love by continuing to verbally abuse her.      I've seen this type of format before, namely the recurrence of various characters in a book of short stories.  Nevertheless, David Schickler deftly handles this format, and has written a very entertaining book about the lives of some strange Manahattanites cavorting in a strange setting.  \\"Kissing In Manhattan\\" is not for everyone, but I do recommend it to the more open-minded types.	2005-09-15

Unfortunately, the unfertile soil, no matter how vigorously tilled, could not yield all that much, and the conditions were brutal.  Still these souls perservered, until desperation drove them out. <br /> <br />What I liked most about Raban's book was the description of the harsh lives that these people had to endure on a daily basis.  The farming methods that they scrupulously obeyed turned out to be completely bogus.  As 21st century Americans leading, for the most part, comfortable lives (although let's never forget about the victims of Hurricane Katrina) it is almost inconceivable what these men, women and children experienced year after year. <br /> <br />And yet, I can't help but wonder about the ancestors of these would-be farmers.  Something tells me that their subsequent generations (perhaps the grandchildren) somehow found their footing in other endeavors, and did quite well.  Perhaps I'm being idealistic, but I have to believe that the work ethic of these immigrants eventually paid off in future generations. <br /> <br />I highly recommend \\"Bad Land,\\" as a description of a time and place in the U.S.A. which you probably will not learn about anywhere else.	2005-09-07

In early Twentieth century New York, Martin Dressler becomes the quintessential American success story, only to fall on his face in the end.  From humble beginnings, he builds grander and grander hotels, almost suggestive of a more sophisticated version of Disney World.  For instance, in one of his hotels, on a sub-basement floor, the canals of Venice are re-created. <br /> <br />Dressler makes the mistake of assuming that people want to bring the outdoors inside in artificially controlled environments.  His increasingly elaborate visions become more and more bizarre, and display a hubris in building which remind one of Donald Trump.  About half way through, the book takes on an oddly claustrophobic, creepy and surrealistic feel, such as when the author depicts Dressler's marriage to his beautiful, but vacuous and frigid wife, or describes people strolling in the underground artificial worlds created by the main character.  The reader just wants to escape from it all, run outside, and take a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br />Although reading \\"Martin Dressler\\" is an odd experience, the book is somewhat flat with little plot and unmemorable characters.  Nevertheless, I can recommend Steven Millhauser's \\"Martin Dressler,\\" but try to purchase it second hand. <br /> <br />	2005-08-31

Susan Howatch is probably the closest approximation we have to a modern day Anthony Trollope in her character driven style of writing, and plot development.  Howatch, like Trollope, is fascinated by the moral choices people make, and the reasons for making them (eg. religious belief, guilt, envy, etc.).  However, where Trollope tends to use more wry sarcasm, Howatch relies on (often deceptively) romantic scenes, and generational bonds.    \\"Wheel of Fortune,\\" 1171 pages long, revolves around the idea that people are tied to the mis-deeds committed by past generations, and, unless great effort is applied to break the destructive cycle, are usually condemned to repeat history.  Most of the story takes place at an historic mansion known as Oxmoon in early twentieth century Wales on the Gower Peninsula. The main characters are frequently obsessed with \\"doing the done thing,\\" \\"drawing the line,\\" and generally keeping up appearances, often with tragic results.      The book is divided up into six parts, each of which is told from the perspective of a different character, and which, in total, spans over 60 years.  Robert Godwin, the narrator of Part One, is the oldest son and heir to Oxmoon.  Outwardly, he's a hard man, completely rational and highly intelligent.  His obsession is his slightly older cousin Genevra, and the greatest moment of his life was waltzing with her, as a teenager, under the Oxmoon crystal chandeliers to the \\"Blue Danube,\\" though Ginervra loves another.  Howatch repeats this romantic scene over and over again, usually as a metaphor that things aren't as grand as they appear to be (anyone who reads \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" as a romantic novel needs to read it again).  Through Ginevra's section (Part Two), we learn how vulnerable Robert really is, in more ways than one.    Parts One and Two of \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" are mere preludes to the heart of the book.  In Part Three, Robert's younger brother John, who becomes the head of the family, narrates.  John excelsat drawing everyone's \\"line\\" except his own.  The love of his life, Bronwen, is several stations below John, but John finds he can love no one else.  John acts as sort of the family referee, especially between the greatest rivals of the story, Harry and Kester.     Parts Four and Five (repectively Robert's son, Kester [who in adulthood, bears some unsettling resemblance to Michael Jackson], and John's son, Harry) turn the book into a page turner, and make \\"Wheel of Fortune,\\" into a terrific read.  The relationship between Kester and Harry (and their rivalry with respect to Oxmoon) is always intriguing, and takes some unexpected twists and turns, to say the least.  Their destinies intertwine, usually in a destructive manner, and both ultimately pay for their hatred of the other.    Howatch could have ended the book with a final struggle between Kester and Harry, but chose to look into the future with Hal, Harry's son, (but emotionally closer to his uncle, Kester) in a spell-binding part Six, where Hal attempts to unravel the last great family mystery.  There is always hope and redemption, the author seems to say, and we are not necessarily condemned to repeat the past.    All-in-all, I found \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" to be engrossing and memorable.  I didn't give it 5 stars, because I think Howatch can be heavy-handed and repetitious with romantic metaphor and pithy speeches.  How many times do we need to hear about that waltz under the chandeliers to the \\"Blue Danube?\\"  Do the characters necessarily have to say that they are \\"drawing the line\\" or \\"doing the done thing\\" on every other page?      Another quibble has to do with the character Bronwen (John's true love).  Although many of the Welsh names and towns sound like they come from \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (perhaps the British Tolkien was influenced by this), does Bronwen really have to talk like the immortal queen of the Elves, or Yoda from Star Wars?  Every time Bronwen would open her mouth and spout some celtic mysticism, I would almost groan out loud.    I also cannot accept how young children get over the death of a parent so quickly, and visa versa.  I think I understand the stiff-upper-lip attitude of this culture, but the death of a mother to a young child surely would affect him more than, for example, a rivalry with a cousin over a piece of property.    Even so, I highly enjoyed \\"Wheel of Fortune,\\" and recommend it, even given its length.  If you like Susan Howatch, may I also recommend Gail Godwin, and Stuart O'Nan's \\"Wish You Were Here.\\"  And, of course, the master himself, Anthony Trollope.	2005-08-29

Confined to a room at an unknown location, he is essentially made into their sexual slave.  Horrific ordeal or fantasy?  I suppose it depends on one's point of view.  Although the description of the sexual acts performed on the man are certainly the most charged part of \\"The Book of Revelations,\\" I think the main point concerns the man's obsession with discovering the identities of his kidnappers, and the location of the room, after he is let go.  In this regard, it sort of reminded me of John Fowles' \\"The Magus,\\" which I believe to be one of the most overrated books ever written.  In both novels, the main characters' lives become defined by their respective pursuits of their former tormentors, even at the price of sacrificing their own lives and identities. <br /> <br />\\"The Book of Revelations,\\" contains very little in the way of revelation, but it's an interesting read due to the bizarre subject matter (and alot shorter than \\"The Magus\\"!).	2005-08-16

It has been prominently displayed for weeks at the Border's bookstore where I purchased it, and you would think that someone would have reviewed it on this website by now.  I feel an extra responsibility to get it right.  Anyway, I'm pretty confident in stating that \\"Clear\\" is not so bad, and not so great.    As a backdrop to what is basically a first person narrative stream of consciousness, we have David Blaine's stunt where he confined himself in a suspended glass tank in London, without eating anything, drinking only water, for 44 days, while London crowds looked on in fascination and disgust.  Blaine, of course, is one of those new breeds of extreme magicians/performance artists, who subject themselved to unimaginable hardships, or is it all just some illusion?    In any event, Nicola Barker combines the styles of Whit Stillman (who wrote the screenplays for \\"Metropolitan,\\" \\"Barcelona,\\" and \\"Last Days of Disco\\"), with Jack Kerouac's classic \\"On the Road.\\"  What you basically have is a bunch of twenty or thirty something men and women who are far too clever, can refer to the most obscure subjects at the drop of a hat, and who listen to the coolest music imaginable.  They all have quirky and sometimes androgenous names (e.g. main character and narrator Adair, his larger than life roomate Solomon, Solomon's girlfriend Jalisa, Adair's former male co-worker Hilary, and Adair's two female interests Aphra and Bly).  Everyone has something quite deep to say about David Blaine, as well as other unrelated subjects, which get analyzed on an impossibly intellectual level, including (perhaps most interestingly) the western \\"Shane\\" (in its novel form).  Are otherwise average middle class people who live in England so much more clever than their American counter-parts?    Nicola Barker writes in an interesting and unique voice, which didn't quite do it for me in \\"Clear.\\"  However, if the above sounds interesting toyou, you will almost certainly enjoy the book.	2005-08-16

In fact, he finally demonstrates his full talents by smelling a popular perfume, and stating accurately exactly what ingredients it consists of, and in what proportions.  He can then easily improve upon it, and goes on to mix some of the top perfumes in France.  His \\"greatest work\\" is produced by serially murdering virgins, and formulating an essence from their bodies that can conjure up an illusion that its wearer is a saint.    I enjoyed reading about the art of making perfume, as well as the atmosphere the author created of an uncaring society (although both of these subjects are both done better in Michel Faber's \\"Crimson Petal and the White\\").  But the main character, who at first we pity, soon becomes utterly loathsome and devoid of any merit.  Midway through the book, I lost interest in him, and all the other characters for that matter.    I know \\"Perfume\\" must be read as an allegory, but I couldn't help but think that the finest perfume in the world is not going to make anyone see beauty when there's ugliness, either physical or otherwise.  In fact, the opposite is true -- a pleasant scent on a loathsome person soon becomes unpleasant.  In my humble opinion, \\"Perfume,\\" though fairly well-written and definitely unique, should not be receiving all these five star reviews.  Ah well! I guess beauty lies in the nose of the smeller!	2005-07-28

The workers, who have been brainwashed to forget their past lives, must closely obey certain arbitrary rules, or get punished, or even tortured.  The main character, Louse (sort of like the butler played by Anthony Hopkins in \\"Remains of the Day\\"), who occasionally has glimpses of his former life, serves as a cog in a corporate nightmare as the head honcho's right hand man and narcotic administer.  He can hardly comprehend the world he has become a part of, nor does he try very hard to.  At one point, a conspiracy brews, but neither Louse nor the reader can figure out who exactly is behind it, nor whether it actually succeeds.   <br /> <br />As an Orwellian version of corporate America, \\"Louse\\" is only partially successful.  Although the book was a fairly intense read, it doesn't hold a candle to the much better \\"1984,\\" and, frankly, I was relieved when I finished.  Still, I would like to see what David Grand writes next; he obviously has a talent for presenting ideas in an unusual manner.	2005-07-12

The two main characters are Shereel Dupont (born as Dorothy Turnipseed), and her slave-driving, borderline sadistic manager/trainer Russell Morgan (a/k/a Russell Muscle).  That Shereel will prevail in the middleweight division (114-124 lbs) is a foregone conclusion, but, to win the coveted title of \\"Ms. Cosmos,\\" she must beat the 156 lbs. of pure muscle, steroid-enhanced, Marvella Washington, who she has faced a few times before.  According to Russell, winning is everything, anything else -- whether it be second or last place -- is utter failure, and, unfortunately, Shereel buys into this.    What makes \\"Body\\" unique and hilarious, is the introduction of Shereel's eccentric southern family (parents, two brothers, and one sister) and psychopathic, Vietnam Vet, knife wielding boyfriend, known as \\"Nail Head.\\"  Their love and affection for Shereel is unwavering, even if they're uncertain as to exactly what she's doing.  In a bizarre sub-plot, Shereel's portly sister Earline, and a male bodybuilder nicknamed \\"Billy Bat\\" (he has the best back in the world) fall in love, and have a sexual encounter that only Harry Crews can dream up.  Russell is going out of his mind trying to prepare Shereel for the contest, while simultaneously containing the Turnipseeds and Nail.    In the meantime, Marvella's trainer, Wallace \\"The Wall\\" Wilson, has his own hands full with Marvella's four shucking and jiving sisters, all with names that rhyme, and all potential champions in their own right.  Until the shocking ending, there are a number of passages involving the families of Shereel and Marvella which will have the reader laughing out loud.    What I especially like about \\"Body\\" is how Crews describes the best and worst sides of athletic competition.  At best, this body-building competition bridges the gap between people of all different races, religions and cultures.  Thedifferences between the bodybuilders are irrelevant in the face of the universal desire to compete and win.  The racist attitudes of some of the characters are shown to be utterly absurd.  On the other hand, Crews depicts the dangers of a win-at-all-costs attitude, whether through chemical enhancement, or the belief that even coming in second place means complete failure.    Although I thought that \\"The Knockout Artist\\" and \\"A Feast of Snakes\\" were better Crews' novels, \\"Body\\" is his funniest work, and thoroughly enjoyable.  Harry Crews writes in a completely unique voice, and I regret that he seems to have retired.    (Note: The character Russell Muscle appears in several of the author's other novels, as well).	2005-07-07

In \\"Father and Son,\\" Brown gives us the classic confrontation of good (Sheriff Bobby and most of the other characters) verses evil (Glen, just released from prison) in the uneducated rural south of the late 60's.  The good guys smoke heavily, guzzle whiskey and beer like water, and often gamble above their heads.  The bad guy does the same, plus kills, rapes, and assaults.  I kept thinking to myself that all of these people, both good and bad, would die prematurely of cancer, heart disease, or cirrhosis of the liver.  But given the extremely tedious and uneventful lives of these people, I couldn't really blame them. <br /> <br />Anyway, after evil Glen gets out of jail, he has some old scores to settle, and seemingly no one, not Virgil -- his father, Randolph (a/k/a \\"Puppy\\")-- his brother, Jewel -- his former girlfriend and mother of his child, nor Sheriff Bobby, can do anything to stop him.  It is hardly a surprise that Bobby's and Glen's life intersect in more ways than one. <br /> <br />Brown is quite a unique voice in describing life in the uneducated rural south, which, to us Northeasterners, is a strange place indeed!  I'm just not sure what it adds to his story to describe a character lighting up or smoking a cigarette, and/or drinking whisky, on every single page.  Still, I recommend \\"Father and Son\\" to those who like this type of literature, as I do Brown's \\"Joe\\" and \\"Fay,\\" both of which, in my opinion, were slightly better.	2005-07-06
US	14244739	R3A7XRQT8LOVJ4	0345461622	197047472	Pandora's Star	Books	5	13	16	N	N	An incredible work -- even though somewhat derivative	\\"Pandora's Star\\" by Peter F. Hamilton, has been deservedly compared to Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" and Herbert's \\"Dune.\\"  Some of the more astute reviewers also mention Nivens' and Pournelle's \\"Mote in God's Eye,\\" and Simmons' complex \\"Hyperion.\\"    In Hamilton's vision of the late 24th century, hundreds of worlds within hundreds of light years from the Earth have been peopled (collectively known as the \\"Commonwealth\\"), not by way of space ships, but through man-made stable wormholes, originally conceived and built in the late 21st century by Ozzie Isaac and Sheldon Nigel, two of the book's main characters. Virtually all of the one hundred billion human beings are connected by instantaneous communication -- the Cybersphere, basically a futuristic internet, which is built in the brain along with other electronic enhancements.      The other great human advancement concerns mortality; specifically, every 20 years or so, those humans who can afford it get \\"rejuvenated\\" and restored to an earlier age.  If one dies in some accident -- no problem -- most have available a dormant clone who is quickly aged by artificial means to adulthood, and who then receives all of the memories from a built in \\"memory cell,\\" which has recorded all of the original person's life experiences.  With this  technological \\"advancement,\\" Hamilton asks some very complicated ethical questions about aging, and what it really means to be an individual person.    As the story unfolds with an enormous cast of characters (the book would really benefit from a reference guide, ala \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" so that one doesn't need to refer to earlier chapters as a reminder of whose who) a second-rate astronomer, Dudley Bose, observes (or, perhaps, is made to observe) the sudden disappearance of two stars, Dyson Alpha and Dyson Beta.  This completely baffling phenomenon also interests the two extremely advanced aliens that humans have come into contact with: the secretive \\"High Angel\\" (think of the aliens in Clarke's \\"Childhood's End\\") and the childlike, enigmatic, elf-like \\"Silfen\\" (who remind me of several advanced but child-like aliens in the \\"Star Trek\\" series).  Also interested in this phenomenon is the \\"SI,\\" a massive computer program that has become self-aware (sound familiar?).  It quickly becomes evident that all three of these entities have their own hidden agendas.    Another major character is Paula Myo, a famous criminologist known throughout the Commonwealth, who, for over a hundred years, has been hunting down Bradley Johannson, the leader of a quasi-terrorist group which are convinced that various important leaders are being controlled by an alien known as the \\"Starflyer,\\" considered to be a mere myth by the vast majority.     While Hamilton attempts (I believe successfully) to juggle a number of plots at once, the main one involves the exploration of the Dyson pair by humans on a starship with faster than light travel.  Basically, a huge force field around these stars is discovered, which suddenly disengages when the starship approaches, resulting in the release of aliens known as \\"Primes.\\" These absolutely terrifying aliens can best be described as a combination of the \\"Borg,\\" George R.R.Martin's \\"Sandkings,\\" and the creature that a bunch of humans turn into in Dean Koontz' \\"Midnight.\\"  Another words, they ain't pretty and they're coming for us.  We are first introduced to the inner world of the Primes in Chapter 18, a chapter so intense, that the book was literally shaking in my hands.    The second main story concerns Ozzie's (remember him? He's one of the guys who first developed the wormhole hundreds of year earlier) adventure on the \\"Silfen Paths\\" which takes him, and other companions, on a journey through a number of harsh worlds.  The Silfens, although obviously incredibly advanced, still enjoy something so primitive as hunting \\"ice-whales,\\" which might described as a combination of a whale and T-Rex in a bad mood.    As pointed out already by severalreviewers, alot in \\"Pandora's Star\\" has previously been covered by other sci-fi writers.  Also, some of the science is clearly questionable.  For myself, I can accept the notion of stable wormholes quicker than the idea that humans could not only readily populate so many other planets, but could also eat the native food and breathe the native air.  But these quibbles do not diminish Hamilton's monumental accomplishment here.  Of course there are slow parts of the book; after all, my edition is 988 pages long, and as I already mentioned, Hamilton's modus operandi seems to be to have a number of story lines.  Simply put, \\"Pandora's Star\\" is incredible, as good as any space opera I have ever read.      It's unfortunate that some readers were unaware that this book is only Volume One (to be followed up by \\"Judas Unleashed,\\" which will be available in January 2006).  Perhaps the publishers should have been more forthcoming, but to blame Hamilton is rather unfair.  I can't wait until the sequel, and may even spring for the hard-cover version, which is quite a rarity for me.	2005-06-27

Let me start off by saying that I read the plain hardcover version of \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" but this website, for some reason, has not accepted any reviews written after May 29, 2005.  An illustrated version sounds like a good idea, and I will browse through one as soon as I spot it in the bookstore.<br /><br />On my last vacation, I noticed that half the crowd was reading one Dan Brown book or another, so I decided to get on board by reading \\"Angels and Demons\\" followed by the \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" which both chronicle the adventures of Robert Langdon, part Harvard Professor symbologist (with a sub-specialty in secret societies), and part Indiana Jones.  The beautiful, lithe and brilliant Vittoria of \\"Angels\\" is now replaced by the equally beautiful, lithe and brilliant Sophie Neveu, top-rate French criminologist.  The books both follow the same basic formula: plenty of cliff-hangers, good guys who are really bad, and suspicious ornery guys who are really good.<br /><br />In short, in \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" an albino monk, a member of Opus Dei -- a secret Catholic offshoot where the leaders flog themselves and wear barbed wire anklets (I realize there's more to it than that)-- has been ordered by the \\"Teacher\\" to murder the top members of the Priory of Scion, another secret society, which alone holds the key to the real history of Jesus' life and early Christianity.  Its military branch, Knights Templar, now long defunct, has hidden the Holy Grail, which is not a chalice (or cup of any sort) but rather secret documents revealing the importance of Mary Magdalene in the Jesus story.  Before he is murdered, The most important member of the Priory, Jacques Sauniere (Sophie's grandfather who raised her after the death of her parents) leaves clues for Sophie and Robert to find the Grail, so that the \\"true\\" story of Jesus might not be lost.  Some of these clues are revealed in the greatest works of Leonardo Da Vinci, who himself was once the top dog of the Priory (hence the title of the book).  Sophie hasn't spoken to her poor grandfather in years, after she observed him taking part in a Paganistic ritual, symbolically \\"joining\\" Father and Mother Earth.  Other, more thinly drawn characters also figure into the plot.  As in \\"Angels,\\" the chapters are short, most ending in a cliff-hanger or a surprising revelation.  Pages are turned quickly as the reader races to reach a resolution.  I guessed the identity of the Teacher early on, not because I'm particularly insightful, but because I think I understand how Brown creates plot (actually, later in the book, I changed my mind about the Teacher's identity, having been misled by the private thoughts of a character who actually knew who he was, which I felt was somewhat dishonest on the author's part).<br /><br />Dan Brown is a fairly proficient thriller writer.  What makes him so popular, I believe, is that he tackles big and provocative issues such as the \\"true\\" life and teachings of Jesus, the nature of the Vatican and Catholicism, and world-wide conspiracies led by super secret societies.  Just from browsing the other day in a book store, I think it's obvious that other writers will now attempt to copy Brown by dealing with these subjects as well.<br /><br />In conducting some research on some of the claims in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" I learned that Brown often relies on questionable unscholarly sources.  For instance, although most scholars agree that the figure to the immediate right of Jesus in Da Vinci's \\"Last Supper\\" is the Apostle John, Brown claims it's definitely Mary Magdalene, relying on sources who come up with their \\"theories\\" largely on pure speculation.  It's certainly interesting, but what is it really based on?  At one point, the book claims that, in a three hundred year period, the Catholic Church put to death five million women, by burning them at the stake, for being guilty of one kind of heresy or another.  Shouldn't a highly disturbing and controversial claim like this be thoroughly documented?  It's my understanding that this number is probably wildly inflated (although, for certain, any number is unacceptable).<br /><br />As a non-Christian, I agree with Brown's assessment that there seems to be a profound disconnect between the teachings of Jesus according to the New Testament (i.e. anti-accumulation of wealth, forgive the sinner, turn the other cheek) as compared with the later practices of the Catholic Church, especially during Medieval times.  Brown's overall theme seems to be that women were considered far more important in early Christianity (as influence by Paganism) which later developed into a male-dominated religion that subjugated women.  However, many cultures and religions throughout history have, unfortunately, subjugated women, including various forms of \\"Paganism.\\"<br /><br />In the end, I appreciate that \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" has made me think about these issues.  The problem is the slew of books that will follow by less talented writers who re-interpret some major religion or piece of history without any factual basis, or claim some massive conspiracy by some secret society that has little influence in the real world.derstanding that this number is probably wildly inflated (although, for certain, any number is unacceptable).

He uses language like poetry, and his characters jump off the pages with their idiosyncracies.  There are good guys, bad guys, and everything in between.  Here, Nichols explores the subject that seems to most interests him, namely, the cultural destruction of a small southwestern town due to \\"progress,\\" and the never ending quest for more riches.  He never pretends that life was so great before, or that gentrification is always bad, but Nichols certainly wants the reader to understand the unfortunate consequences of converting a small town into a vacation spot on the lives of those who live there.    It is not easy to read \\"The Magic Journey.\\"  The plot tends to drag in places, and, Nichols liberally sprinkles his prose with Spanish, which, unfortunately, I don't speak.  Nichols also tends to show off his prodigious knowledge concerning the southwest and its environment, and is somewhat heavy handed in his anti-progress stance.  However, the writing is so beautiful that it is well worth it, even if you can read only a few pages of the book each day.  Eventually, I intend to read the other two books in the trilogy.	2005-06-09
US	14244739	R22ILHZF5IWSWV	0060934808	931435117	Dreamland: A Novel	Books	4	6	6	N	N	The seedy side of NYC at the turn of the century	In the well-researched \\"Dreamland,\\" as its name suggests, Kevin Baker gives us a  surrealistic portrayal of the seedy side of New York City at the beginning of the 20th Century.  Through various (often strange) characters, we are introduced to Jewish immigrants, gang life, corrupt politicians, the introduction of unions and the feminist movement, and the disturbing things that used to pass for entertainment at Coney Island.  Baker also effectively depicts the deplorable living and working conditions of immigrants in New York during this era, and the appalling circumstances of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire.  Less effective is a fictitious visit from Freud and Jung to New York, where the former worries that his being Jewish will prevent his teachings in psychology to be taken seriously. <br /> <br />In scene after scene, Baker focuses on the outright evil that exists in some people.  The author doesn't mince words or spare the reader instances of cruelty.  In one minor scene, for instance, a particularly vicious main character forces a peddler to feed poison to his beloved horse, upon which his livelihood completely depends.  The business owners are, for the most part, despicable, making their workers slave 14 hours a day, six days a week, in the most vile conditions imaginable at meager wages. <br /> <br />While some reviewers didn't like the uncertain end, I had no problem with it.  Baker reminds us that better days are ahead, and that individual human dignity must never be lost.  Perhaps Baker tries to do too much in this book, but \\"Dreamland\\" makes a powerful statement, and I recommend it to anyone interested in this part of our history.	2005-06-06

US	14244739	R1TKG66MBKGENK	0671027360	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	3	4	5	N	N	(three and a half stars) Far fetched but effective thriller	I have to say that I enjoyed reading the reviews of this book (I read the previous 70) as much as the book itself.  As is usually the case, the most fun were the negative lengthier reviews.  Throughout \\"Angels and Demons,\\" I just tried to expel my disbelief (\\"suspend\\" was just not enough) and hold on for the ride.  Dan Brown gives us more twists and turns then the rollercoasters of Six Flags.    Let's meet the cast of characters.  First there's Robert Langdon, part Indiana Jones, part James Bond (think of the beginning sequence of \\"Moonraker\\"), part humble nerdy Harvard professor, who, of course, gets the pretty brilliant female marine biologist at the end (George Costanza she is not).  Robert is not only proficient in symbology and ancient cults, but also has at his fingertips intimate knowlege of Renaissance Italian artworks, the architecture of the Vatican, and the ability to use a small piece of tarp to guide him safely, without a parachute, from a high-flying helicopter into a river.  Oh yeah, and he's something of an escape artist.    Then there's beautiful brilliant \\"lithe\\" Vittoria Vestra, with her tight fitting shorts.  Any knowledge that Robert might not possess, Vittoria thankfully fills in (what a Trivial Pursuit team these two would make!).  Vittoria, adopted and raised by a billiant compassionate physicist/priest, is helping Robert to hunt down his father's vicious killer, presumably a member of the previously thought defunct Illuminati, as well as help Robert retrieve a ticking anti-matter device, that she and her father made, and which is now hidden somewhere in the Vatican.    Next we have the Hassassin, the ruthless Arabic killer with his own agenda.  Here is Max Kohler, the head of CERN - think of a brilliant version of Raymond Burr in Ironside - who may or may not be evil.  Next is the Carmelengo, the now deceased Pope's young assistant - God fearing, brave, and righteous to a fault - or is he?  Finally we have the Vatican itself, the Vatican special forces, the Cardinals (including the four Preferetti - those most likely to be elected the new Pope), secret lairs, ultra-secret lairs, and double secret probation lairs.    Basically, Robert tries to save the kidnapped four Preferetti from being murdered at different secret Illumanati locations, and avert the disaster of the anti-matter device destroying The Vatican.  Who's really behind it all?  Hmm.      Sounds sort of ridiculous right?  It may be, but Brown's real intention is to get the reader to turn pages and to read past his/her bedtime, and that is definitely accomplished.  Brown's writing talents are above average for the thriller genre.  Sometimes though, you roll your eyes like when he ends many short chapters with a cliff-hanger and writes something like \\"Robert hoped Vittoria was still alive, but if he had known where she was, he would have felt otherwise.\\"  There are many such examples.    Some other comments:  First, I would think that with these kind of circumstances, half the Italian police force, with assistance from numerous other countries around the globe, would become involved (remember the attempted assassination on John Paul II?).  Thousands (if not tens of thousands) of law enforcement officials might actually have a better chance of capturing the enemy then poor Robert running around in his tweed jacket.      Second, I kind of liked the \\"second\\" ending.  I thought that if the \\"first\\" ending were the true one, one would have to conclude that the pursuit of science is amoral at best and immoral at worst, and must be \\"contained\\" by religion.  (In my humble opinion, the real struggle is not between \\"science\\" and \\"religion\\" per se, but rather between rationality and the desire to advance, as opposed to extremism and the desire to be bound by the writings of a one ancient text or another).       In any event, I have started reading the \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" which, so far, seems to be pretty much the same book.  Oh well, I'll be finished with itin a few days.	2005-05-21
US	14244739	R19NECVDMM6U5T	0374100179	521758176	Aaron Burr: The Conspiracy and Years of Exile, 1805-1836	Books	4	10	16	N	Y	The wacky world of Aaron Burr	This extremely compelling (and, unfortunately, out-of-print) biography picks up Aaron Burr's life after he killed Alexander Hamilton in U.S. history's most famous duel (which, by the way, took place in Weehawken, New Jersey, along the bank of the Hudson River) and after the conclusion of his vice presidential term.  In fact, Jefferson and Burr were sworn enemies, and their mutual hatred only increased over time (Burr was vice president for only the first of the two terms that Jefferson served). <br /> <br />In 1805, the cash-strapped Burr, already widely considered a scoundrel, became basically a con artist, who attempted to raise money by telling people of means what they wanted to hear.  To ambitious Americans, he was leading an army to \\"conquer\\" portions of the now-southern United States and Mexico, which were controlled by Spain, if and when the  U.S. and Spain went to war.  For those less aggressive, he was simply leading a group of pioneers to settle what were known as the Bastrop lands.  The story he told to potential Spanish and British backers was quite different: he was raising an army to conquer \\"western\\" U.S. States bordering the Mississippi, which would then be allied to Spain or Britain (depending on whom he was talking to) although no one could ever prove that this was his real intention.  While some of his backers and allies were sincere, others, like General Wilkinson, the \\"dictator\\" of New Orleans, and on the payroll as an agent from Spain, turned out to be an even bigger scoundrel than Burr, and betrayed Burr to Jefferson.  When Jefferson began taking the threat of Burr seriously, an army was raised to defeat Burr's \\"army\\" which consisted of 60 to 100 men, women and children which could not have invaded a small island, not to mention an entire State. <br /> <br />Ex-Vice President Burr was then put on trial for treason, presided over by Chief Justice John Marshall acting in his capacity as a circuit judge, and, after hearing from 50 or so witnesses, a jury eventually acquitted him of all charges (thanks in large part to Marshall's instructions to the jury regarding the law).  Burr than fled to Britain to escape his numerous creditors, and criminal charges in different states (including the murder of Hamilton).  In Europe, he basically lived like a nobleman at night, and a pauper during the day.  Eventually, he returned to the U.S. and, at a relatively old age, resumed his profession as a lawyer, but always remained in debt, and in search of a \\"get rich quick\\" scheme.  Always, throughout his life, Burr stayed extremely close to his daughter, Theodosia, one of the few people who Burr ever truly respected.  Late in life, he also developed relationships with the children of various women he had affairs with after his wife died. <br /> <br />Burr's life was incredibly bizarre, much stranger than fiction.  Milton Lomask does an admirable task in trying to convey Burr's life, although I got the feeling that he grew maybe a little too sympathetic to his subject.  Lomask, however, is not in the same class of biographers as, for example, David McCullough or Ron Chernow.  That is why I believe the definitive book about this fascinating and complex man has yet to be written.  I do, however, recommend Lomask's book about the second half of Burr's life, and I plan on reading his other biography about the first half.	2005-05-10

Greg Iles is a good writer of the modern-day thriller genre, which is not really saying too much.  His characters are usually thinly drawn and speak in unrealistic stilted dialogue.  The heroes of his three books that I have read are pretty much interchangeable, all with predictable traits, including self-doubt and the obligatory \\"past.\\"  \\"Mortal Fear\\" is just plain silly.  The idea that people would pay large sums to be in a sex chat room is so ridiculous that my ability to suspend disbelief, which is, of course, necessary in all Greg Iles thrillers, immediately stopped.    The heroes of Greg Iles books seem to believe that since they are smarter than the FBI, CIA, and other law enforcement officials, they must withhold vital information, but, of course, they always make the right decisions because they're the ones who capture the bad guy in the end.  Any story about grappling with an internet killer is going to appear out-dated because of how fast this technology advances, and \\"Mortal Fear\\" is no exception.    Note to other reviewers: Do the multiple reviewers of this book really feel that this book merits five stars?  Does this mean that all Ile's books are likewise rated, as well as all similar thrillers by comparable authors?  If so, what rating should one give to a truly superior book?  Just asking.	2005-05-02

The drug turns common Eddie into a super intelligent, efficient and suave party animal.  He can charm any crowd with his wit and intelligence, and, through his savvy in the stock market, he becomes very rich.  Of course, there is a dire price to be paid which is not all that different from any other drug (i.e. a need for increasing amounts, and painful agonizing symptoms) but everything is magnified.  As we become aware of later, this drug is being clandestinely used by others as well.   <br /> <br />Glynn has written a very effective and unusual thriller.  When Eddie is on the drug, the book is kinetic, and reminds me of \\"Bright Lights Big City.\\"  The parts where Eddie tries to discover the origin of the drug doesn't work quite as well, but \\"The Dark Fields\\" is definitely a cut above your run-in-the-mill thriller, and I recommend it.  An impressive debut novel from Alan Glynn, but, since it was published in 2001, I am curious as to why his second one is taking so long.	2005-05-01

Polly, attractive and intelligent (as all the females at Yale seem to be that Danny crosses paths with) is dating a respected young professor, but expresses interest in having a relationship with Danny, who is completely smitten by her.  But wait!  Danny comes from a blue collar New Jersey background and he has left behind a girl-friend, Cindy, a big haired secretary, who will not make it easy for Danny to escape her.   <br /> <br />A large segment of the book covers Danny's return home for spring break to help his father, recovering from hemorrhoid surgery, on the \\"Roach Coach\\" -- a food, beverage and coffee truck serving various factory workers.  But wait again!  Another lunch truck is trying to squeeze Danny' father and others out of the business by \\"competing\\" in an extremely aggressive manner -- think Tony Soprano. <br /> <br />Perrotta can be extremely humorous, and most of his asides about pretentious college students and their various papers and projects are hits rather than misses.  I just feel that \\"Joe College\\" is really more about musings and reflections than anything else.  Danny miraculously gets out of one jam after another, which leads me to believe that Perrotta is really not interested in realism here.  Danny, himself, does not seem to grow as a character, or learn anything; for instance in the very last scene, he fools around with a high school girl (a fellow cafeteria worker) who has violent protective brothers, and, with no mention of birth control.  Perhaps Perrotta istrying to be ironic, or something else which I really could not discern. <br /> <br />In any event, \\"Joe College\\" is not as good as \\"Little Children.\\"  The characters are weakly drawn, and there are no lessons to be learned (other than one should try to be, and get, lucky).  On the other hand, \\"Joe College\\" is a humorous breezy book that never bores the reader.	2005-04-25
US	14244739	RBCISGJ0IA6RN	014027166X	210313938	Riven Rock	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Skillful writing, but somewhat overdone	T.C. Boyle is one of our most talented modern day writers, and that ability is clearly demonstrated in \\"Riven Rock,\\" a story, loosely based on true events which occurred in the beginning of the 20th century (and spans roughly 30 years), about Stanley McCormick, the son of the immensely rich inventor of the reaper, and his confinement due to mental illness to a house located in California, named \\"Riven Rock\\" by a younger saner Stanley.  Stanley, who also has an insane sister, marries the beautiful brilliant Katherine Dexter, who maintains her loyalty and (perhaps) fidelity to the bitter end.  During Stanley's confinement, his \\"treatment\\" is administered by various nationally renowned psychiatrists, who employ various techniques, usually influenced by Freud and other psychoanalysts, all with disappointing results.  From the point of view of modern medicine, it is easy to see that Stanley is really well beyond any help that these doctors can provide, and may not have been significantly improved even by modern-day psychotropic drugs, for the main and simple reason that Stanley is nuts, really really nuts.    Interestingly, the character that receives more of Boyle's attention than any other is O'Kane, Stanley's chief nurse, who is a womanizer, adulterer, and functioning alcoholic.  Largely through O'Kane's eyes, the reader sees the different doctors come and go, and the progress (or lack of it) that Stanley makes under their respective care.  Additionally, in alternating chapters, Boyle covers the period of Stanley's courtship of Katherine, the period of their engagement, and their honeymoon and early marriage.  While at first, one thinks of Katherine as admirable in her dedication towards her huband's mental well-being, I for one, eventually came to the conclusion that her sticking with Stanley, in an obviously hopeless situation, revealed an obsessive-compulsive disorder on her part.  You feel like shaking her and telling her to wake up and smell the coffee.    Thereis no doubt that T.C. Boyle is an extraordinarily talented writer.  His abilities to use metaphor, turn a phrase, and integrate rare words never seen anywhere else, are truly unique and remarkable.  I just think \\"Riven Rock\\" is too long, and Boyle, sometimes, is simply just showing off his skills.  We understand, this guy is totally off his rocker -- so why do we need example after example of his bizarre behavior?  In any event, I do recommend \\"Riven Rock,\\" but wish Boyle (or his editor) had tightened it up a bit.	2005-04-22

In my opinion Michel Faber's \\"The Crimson Petal and the White\\" stands up to the best Trollope works,as well as those of other Victorian writers, including Dickens.  Faber has the advantage of being able to present the seamier side of that society in a far more candid light than could 19th century writers, who were restricted by societal mores and censorship. <br /> <br />     Here, we are first introduced to various prostitutes, their \\"clientelle,\\" and the conditions under which they live and work.  Sugar, a young, bright, attractive prostitute is fortunate enough to meet William Rackham, a rich man in the perfume business.  William becomes so fond of Sugar that he eventually hires her to be the governess for his young despondent daughter, Sophie, who is completely ignored by both her father, and her mother Agnes, a neurotic shut-in who has been abused psychologically by William, and sexually by her \\"trusted\\" family physician.  Along the way, we are introduced to William's two caddish friends (basically Victorian versions of fratboys), William's pious but lustful brother, Henry, and other memorable characters.  Sugar and Sophie increasingly bond, while the Rackham family disintegrates. <br /> <br />     I agree with some of the negative reviewers who point out that the blurb on the cover misrepresents the novel by portraying it as an epic adventure of a prostitute rising in the world.  I also found one of the plot devices hard to believe, namely that a \\"gentlemen\\" would ever invite the prostitute he frequents into his house as, no less, his daughter's governess.  Additionally, Faber's use of metaphor can sometimes be heavy-handed.  With that being said, however, Faber has written a magnificently detailed novel about Victorian times, and vividly portrays both its seedy and privileged sides. <br />     <br />Even given the length of the book, I was never bored, and I plan to read \\"Crimson\\" again.  The negative reviews, in my opinion, do not adequately appreciate the extraordinary effort and preparation that Faber put into \\"Crimson.\\"  Definitely recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-04-15

Here, we are introduced to the main character, Duffy Deeter, a forty year old husband and father, who can best be described as an incredibly repulsive and self-centered human being.  Everything about Duffy is about \\"bettering\\" himself, whether it be lifting more weight, running a faster mile, thrashing his opponent in handball or karate, or lasting longer sexually (by thinking of Hitler and concentration camps!).           Duffy is a cheating husband and absent father who basically has no regard for his wife and son, and spends most of his free time with his lover Marvella, a self-destructive cocaine addict, whom he seems to despise.  Duffy forms an intense friendship with Jerome \\"Tump\\" Walker, after he intentionally kicks Tump in the head while playing handball.  Tump, a cocaine addict, is a star pro football player, but seems to have a way to bring disparate people together, and improbably bonds with Duffy's son (and later, Duffy's lover, wife and mother).  Running throughout the story is Duffy's dealings with his two-faced law partner, Jert MacPherson, who matches Duffy in repulsiveness.         Usually Crews offers the reader at least one character who tries to stand on higher ground.  Perhaps Tump Walker is that person in this book.  However, every character is addicted to one thing or another.  By the end of the book, Duffy apparently trades his addiction of self-centeredness for whisky and vodka.  Is the reader supposed to believe that this is an improvement?  I just never accepted that any of the characters actually bettered themselves or really learned anything.  Of course, the best Crews novels (e.g. \\"The Knockout Artist,\\" \\"A Feast of Snakes,\\" \\"Body,\\" \\"The Scar Lover\\"), have many of the same elements.  I just think these books are more compelling and provide a stronger and clearer moral message.	2005-04-12

What, at first blush, might seem like an enviable gift, turns out to be Selig's addiction and curse.  From early childhood, Selig discovers that others, including his parents, do not always have pleasant thoughts about him.  But more depressing to Selig, is the prospect of losing this ability and living alone in his own mind. <br /> <br />     Silverberg does a masterful job at showing us David Selig's plight, in both his use of his ability and his gradual loss of it.  The book has a number of memorable scenes, for instance when David uses his powers to win a fight against a much stronger bully, or when David becomes obsessed with a woman from whom he is \\"blocked\\" (i.e. he can't read her mind).  As an example of his wasted life, David earns a living by reading the minds of plagiarizing college students so that he can better prepare academic papers on their behalf.  <br /> <br />     David Selig has wasted his life and squandered his only talent, but really, could there have been any alternative?  But his mind reading, though destructive, has become the defining part of his life.  Silverberg has once again demonstrated why he must be considered one of the giants of the \\"soft\\" science fiction genre.  <br />   <br />     Highly recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-04-07

He is mercilessly bullied (\\"yoked\\"), especially in school, until he meets Mingus, a black boy, also being raised by his father, who is a former singer (and current crack addict).  Mingus becomes Dylan's protector and confidant, although it is less clear what Mingus gets out of their friendship (there are suggestions that they are more than just friends).  In this part of Lethem's book, we are introduced to various eccentric satellite characters, who make up the world that Dylan and Mingus live in.  The two boys fantasize about being comic book super-heroes, and together engage in various escapades, mostly centered around spraying graffiti in hard-to-reach places.  So far, so good. <br /> <br />     The problem is that when the book leaves Brooklyn, alot of its descriptive strength is lost.  As one might expect, Dylan and Mingus part ways, and re-unite near the end.  A ring given to them by a delusional homeless man apparently truly bestows super-powers on the bearer.  Lethem is trying to provide some sort of metaphorical or allegorical device, but it is unclear to me exactly what this is.  The book tries to be too many things, and, by the last one-third, it collapses under its own weight of pretentiousness.  I only wish that Lethem, certainly a talented writer, had followed Dylan and Mingus, who, perhaps remain in a changing neighborhood as lifelong friends. <br /> <br />     Reviewer's note:  I am familiar with the Brooklyn street where the first part of \\"Fortress of Solitude\\" takes place.  Most of the brownstones on the street are now valued at over one million dollars.	2005-04-05

On the one hand, black Americans, including slaves, had fought valiantly side-by-side with Washington and his white soldiers against the British in a struggle to free the country.  In doing so, Washington, unlike many of the other elites of his time, realized that blacks were in no way inferior to whites.  On the other hand, Washington kept slaves, and participated in inhumane slave auctions, where children were separated from parents, and spouses from each other. <br /> <br />     Henry Weincek argues that, over time, the cumulative effect on Washington concerning his observations of the horrors of slavery, eventually made him a closet abolitionist, who freed his slaves under his will.  Yet, even though Washington was viewed as almost God-like by the populace, he was unwilling (or, perhaps, feared the consequences) to speak out against slavery when he was President.  In fact, in a rather bizarre chapter of Washington's life, he used the power of his office to re-capture Ona Judge, a house slave particularly valued by his demanding wife, Martha. <br /> <br />     Weincek's portrayal of a slave auction is chilling and memorable.  I also found to be informative his first person accounts, for instance when he visited the slave quarters of Washington's home.  I was surprised in reading about how many bi-racial persons lived during this period as a result of relations (and rampant rape) of slaveowners and their female slaves, and the attitudes towards these people. <br /> <br />     \\"An Imperfect God\\" is an extraordinarily informative book that perhaps could have provided more context of colonial times.  Whether or not it tarnishes Washington's image really should have no bearing when it comes to reporting on the truth.  There is still much to admire about this great man, who, though not the intellectual equal of otherfounding fathers (i.e. Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and Franklin) was, nevertheless, one of our towering figures, who eventually came to realize the evils of slavery.  Weincek suggests, and I agree, that he was in a position to do much more to demonstrate the injustice of this \\"peculiar institution.\\"	2005-04-02

Her father is an acclaimed former FBI agent with a knack for cutting corners.  Their relationship is, well, think Jack and Sydney Bristow of \\"Alias.\\"  Throw in one or two stubborn short-sited superiors, and a hunky local (but smart) cop who just might be the killer.  Mix in a psychopath who hunts pairs of women, kills one of them, and leaves the other in desperate situations with time running out (tic-toc, tic-toc).  This will give you the basic idea of the \\"The Killing Hour\\" by Lisa Gardner, in which one over-used cliche follows another.   <br /> <br />      It's not as if the book isn't entertaining.  In fact, the book is a quick read, and I admire the way Gardner conducted considerable research on flora, geology, and other scientific studies.  Gardner has clearly attempted to write a book a cut above the usual thriller, and she should get credit for that.  However, there are simply too many hackneyed moments, with thinly drawn characters and stilted dialogue.  Additionally, I'm never quite sure why a killer of this magnitude would not be subject to a manhunt of hundreds of law enforcement personnel (I guess the same can be said about James Bond movies). <br /> <br />     In general, I believe that the great majority of thrillers (and so many have been written in the last decade) cannot really be considered (or compared with) literary works.  \\"The Killing Hour\\" is an above average thriller, but that's as far as it goes.	2005-04-01

Maybe it's just a matter of taste, but novels by Harry Crews grab me in a way that few others do.  \\"A Feast of Snakes\\" and \\"The Knockout Artist\\" are my two Crews favorites.  Crews, of course, is best known for his portrayal of depravity, amorality and sin of all types, but there always seems to be (if one looks hard enough) a moral compass present throughout most of his books.  The main character here, Joe Lon Mackey, is certainly no saint, and perhaps despicable in several ways, but he seems to sense the wrongness of the behavior of those around him, especially with reference to the annual rattlesnake round-up for which his otherwise dead-end town is known.  Joe seems to want to change, he just does not know how to.   <br /> <br />     All the typical Crews elements are present in this novel, i.e. quirky and deviant characters, dark humor, and a shocking ending.  Crews also makes a powerful statement in general about cruelty towards animals.  Overall, a great read from an incredible author!	2005-03-31

Over the years, I have read over twenty books by Robert Silverberg, but the two that I re-read every few years are \\"Dying Inside\\" (about the plight of a man losing his ability to read minds), and the \\"The Book of Skulls.\\"  Both are stellar examples of \\"soft\\" science fiction, in that neither has anything to do with space travel or other advanced technology. <br /> <br />     In \\"The Book of Skulls\\" four disparate college boys (Eli, the intellectual Jew; Ned, the conflicted homosexual; Timothy, the preppy jock; and Oliver, the death fearing midwesterner) set on a quest to find a cult promising immortality, which is written about in a dusty manuscript found by Eli in the stacks of the ivy league university that all four attend.  Although the boys are skeptical of the cult's existence, they (especially Oliver) hold out hope, even though one of the requirements to obtain immortality requires the murder of one member of the \\"receptacle\\" by the others, and the suicide of another.  Each chapter is told from the point of view of one of the four, in a rotating fashion. <br /> <br />     The book includes some incredibly memorable scenes, for instance when each boy must confess is darkest secret to one of the others.  To this day, I can't decide which secret is the worst, and which has the greatest impact on the individual telling it, and on the four as a whole. <br /> <br />     I recently read (and reviewed) \\"The Secret History\\" by Donna Tartt, an extraordinarily compelling novel about a group of college kids also engaged in a strange ritual (I gave it five stars).  It would be interesting to know if Tartt read (and was influenced by) \\"The Book of Skulls.\\" <br /> <br />     Unfortunately, it seems that Silverberg in now remembered more for his fantasy series, which began with \\"Lord Valentine's Castle,\\" then his novels written in the late 60's through the 70's.

Various encounters with the Beothuk (a/k/a \\"Red Indians\\" -- they apply red ochre to their skin) end tragically even though the expeditions start off as well-intentioned.  Nearly all of the principles have led difficult lives, which reflect the extreme conditions under which they live.         In many ways, Michael Crummey has written an extraordinarily rich novel, which jumps around in time, compelling the reader to give his or her full concentration.  Additionally, Crummey displays impressive knowledge concerning trapping and fishing skills, and the lives of the Newfoundland settlers and natives.  He also focuses on detail, for instance, the influences of liquor, diseases, and destructive fire which all have the power to destroy individuals and their families (Crummey also covers incest, rape, and a dangerous abortion).         The book is very disturbing in its portrayal of 19th Century barbarism, which is not only directed against the Indians.  Crummey, for example, devotes pages to the brutal methods of dealing with petty criminals in England.  While reading the book, I could not help but become more appreciative of living in the twenty first century, even with all its problems.              I eagerly await Crummey's next novel, which let's hope, will be somewhat less depressing.	2005-03-28

She decides to accept a managerial position at a fading hotel where her parents worked and where she grew up, but her main reason for returning is to write a book about her mother, and to search for an undiscovered third part of a purported trilogy, written by her mother, which is a fantasy series based on Irish folklore.  Carol Goodman gives the reader a healthy dose of the Irish legend of the \\"Selkie,\\" and, as one might expect, Iris' real life (as well as that of her mother's) has many parallels to this legend. <br /> <br />     I appreciate the skill by which Goodman links her story to the Selkie legend, and attempts to craft modern folklore.  However, I found that many parts of the book dragged.  The characters were not terribly interesting, and I stopped caring whether or not the hotel stayed open for business, or if Iris found the third part of the trilogy. <br /> <br />     As in the better \\"Lake of Dead Languages\\" (the author's first novel) Goodman relies on improbable coincidences and implausible connections between the characters, and turns the book, in the end, into basically an Agatha Christie wannabe.  Goodman, obviously, is a talented writer, and I appreciate her study of folklore and legend which she offers in her first two novels.  I think, perhaps, she just tries too hard to mystify and surprise the reader.	2005-03-26

Unfortunately, this poorly written story has many holes in the plot, and does not work as an allegory of the \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" variety.

Although I have never read Clive Barker's longer works, I was always intrigued by the mind that could conceive \\"Hellraiser,\\" perhaps one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen.  Like that movie, in these short stories, Barker returns again and again to the themes of copious amounts of blood, cannibalism, and incensed ghosts looking for revenge (are there any other kind?).  Unfortunately, most of Barker's short stories, though entertaining, are largely forgettable, and simply don't have the resonance of, for instance, a Stephen King story (e.g. remember \\"Trucks\\" -- which was made into a dreadful movie?).  Basically, I would generally give these Barker stories two stars, with some exceptions.        The best story is \\"In the Hills, the Cities,\\" about the entire populations of two towns engaging in an annual phantasmic battle that is difficult to picture in one's mind.  For its originality alone, I would give this four stars.         Three stars go to \\"Dread,\\" in which a sociopath subjects people to their greatest fears while videotaping their inevitable breakdown.  I've seen this before, but it was a good story, nevertheless.  Other three star stand-outs were \\"Midnight Meat Train,\\" \\"The Skins of the Fathers,\\" \\"Rawhead Rex\\" and \\"Scape Goats.\\"         Barker is obviously one of our most important figures of the post-Lovecraft horror genre.  However, the majority of these stories simply are not demonstrative of his talents.  I would like to see him try again with this format, now that he has so many other works under his belt.	2005-03-24

Gary's father Wade was almost a caricature of an evil drunk, who beats his wife and kids when he's not trying to molest one of his daughters, not to mention his thieving, usually from his own family.  We are also introduced to Gary's naive but resilient sister Fay, who is the central character in this second part of what Brown intended to be a trilogy. <br /> <br />     \\"Fay\\" tells of the adventures of a seventeen year old attractive girl, amongst unsavory men (with one important exception) and beaten down women, most of whom are out to take advantage of her.  Sometimes Fay herself seems too naive, and sometimes remarkably sophistated given her destitute background.  She survives, even while many around her don't. <br /> <br />     Unlike \\"Joe\\" where Brown keeps us in basically one place, Fay gets around, and, in fact, despite some other reviews, there is more \\"plot\\" in this book than in \\"Joe\\" (which generally received better reviews).  I have to admit that Brown's frequent descriptions of someone lighting a cigarette, or popping open a can of beer, or asking a companion to \\"fix\\" a drink, can be quite distracting; however, that being said, the writing is lyrical, and the story, memorable.  I suppose that Larry Brown is a matter of taste, but one cannot debate the fact that he is a superior Southern writer with a unique voice.

In these works, Brown is not afraid to present the \\"white trash\\" aspect of the South, and he has found a perfect voice in Joe Ransom, the hard drinking, heavy smoking, ex-con, who generally wants to do right in the world.  His relationship with fifteen year old Gary, his ex-wife, his employees, the madam of a brothel, and others, is truly memorable, in the way that Joe constantly struggles to be a positive moral human being.  Brown's descriptive acumen of things like broken down trucks, and depressing landscapes, is second-to-none. <br /> <br />     I was somewhat destracted by how repeatedly Brown describes Joe's smoking and drinking (do Southerners really \\"fix\\" each other drinks?).  Also, I was disturbed by how many times Joe would drive while under the influence, and, in many instances, actively drink while driving.  I couldn't help but think that Joe would eventually kill somebody in this fashion.

Four Princeton roomates are the central characters in this rather absurd, passably written book, that basically reads like an average thriller, with pretentious nonsense about a tome from the Middle Ages, which contains provocative sketches, and may or may not reveal extraordinary secrets, if only some brilliant scholar can unravel the riddles wrapped in enigmas, etc.  Before we even get to that Middle Age tome, what jumped out at me was how unlikely it would be for these four to be friends (not to mention roomates) in the first place.  For example, would a brilliant outcast nerd, a black pre-med athlete, and a quintessential rich preppy guy really ever be roomates, as they are here? <br /> <br />     When we get to the mysterious work itself (I'm not going to attempt a spelling), the authors devise the most blatant contrivances to show us how important, and deadly, working on it can be.  I could be wrong (honestly, it all became a trifle difficult for me to follow) but one of the characters breaks the \\"code\\" by solving strange riddles, which somehow explains how many letters one has to skip in order for the code to be revealed.  Were these authors aware that a typical home computer could have done all this in seconds (see e.g. \\"The Bible Code\\")?   <br /> <br />     I don't want to leave the impression that the book was worthless.  In fact, it was a page-turner, worthy of many thrillers I have read when I'm in the mood for \\"lighter fare.\\"  Further, the authors really gave it the old college try to make the book seem scholarly and illuminating of a slice of life at an ivy league college.  I suppose, for instance, the description of the Princeton \\"Eating Clubs,\\" and their different social status might be amusing to an alumnus from that school; to the rest of us, it just was obnoxious.	2005-03-21

Richard Papen, rejected and left virtually penniless by his parents, comes out East to an undistinguished small liberal arts college where he becomes intrigued with a professor named Julian who instructs only five students in all things having to do with ancient Greek.  These five unusual people, and Julian, adopt Richard into their \\"family,\\" but, unfortunately, part of the group (excluding Richard and a caddish fellow nicknamed Bunny) go too far with an orgiastic, bacchanal episode where they end up killing a local townsman.  The guilty parties are then terrified that Bunny will reveal their secret. <br /> <br />     No one can question the fact that Donna Tartt is an extraordinary writer, who has attempted something very ambitious here.  For instance, a peripheral part of the story involves Richard having to survive Christmas vacation during a brutally cold winter, in an unheated warehouse with a hole in the roof, and with no money (he nearly dies and is saved by Henry, the dominant member of the group).  Tartt truly makes the reader feel Richard's plight.  This is only one example of a completely mesmerizing portion of the story. <br /> <br />     Of course, as mentioned by other reviewers, there are obvious problems.  First, Richard's five companions are virtually caricatures.  The twins, fragile Charles, and beautiful though vulnerable Camilla, are extremely close, and we all know where that's going.  Henry is both super-intelligent and incredibly naive at the same time.  Bunny is a character out of the \\"Great Gatsby\\" who would be difficult to find in any college campus within the last forty years.  All of them, including Richard, apparently wear jackets and ties all the time, which, among other clues, suggest that Tartt has envisioned an English boarding school as opposed to a typical North-East college campus. <br /> <br />     Furthermore, even while writing a perhaps over-lengthy book, Tartt gives short shrift (perhaps deliberately?) to the two most captivating parts of the novel: The character of Julian, whom the reader never gets to really know, and the events on that fateful evening of the murder. <br /> <br />     Nevertheless, I was totally absorbed while reading \\"The Secret History,\\" and (when reading on the train) would look around wondering who else had experienced this complex story.

Although no clues have been left behind, Harriet focuses on Danny Ratcliff, who had been friends with Robin, but, because of his unfortunate background, is now a meth-amphetamine dealer with his older brother Farish, who can only be described as pure evil (Danny has retained a semblance of conscience).           Before Tartt brings us to the final dramatic confrontation between Harriet and Danny, we are introduced to a wide range of characters, including Harriet's vacuous sister, domineering grandmother and stalwart maid; and Danny's preacher/former criminal brother, and indestructable amoral grandmother.  There are scenes with snakes and water (Tartt often alludes to Biblical references) that are unforgettable, and the author speaks of race, racism and southern culture in a refreshingly unabashed manner.              Although Tartt continues to showcase her exceptional writing talents, I have to agree with the negative reviews that refer to the unwarranted length of the book (over 600 pages).  Unlike \\"The Secret History\\" I sometimes felt that Tartt got sidetracked, and extended scenes for the sake of adding more pages.  I will, however, be first in line to purchase Tartt's third effort (albeit in paperback).         Overall, I do recommend \\"The Little Friend,\\" just not that enthusiastically.	2005-03-20

Justin Stokes, a precocious, despondent 14 year old adolescent, feels trapped in a rural \\"one-horse\\" town to which her family was forced to move for monetary reasons.  Justin's only respite is her fleeting relationship with Ursula DeVane, a vibrant educated woman in her forties, who lives with her highly sensitive, classical pianist brother.  For one summer, Justin goes out of her way to develop a relationship with Ursula, as basically everyone else that she has contact with, including her family members, bores her.  As one might expect though, Ursula and her brother have a past which eventually catches up with them, and which profoundly affects Justin, even into her adulthood.  Although Gail Godwin virtually promises to \\"shock\\" her audience, a reader of contemporary novels will hardly be shocked. <br /> <br />     Godwin is one of our best contemporary writers.  Her description of detail (for instance, how she describes a garden, or a pond in the forest) rivals the best 19th century British authors.  I love, for example, how Justin practices her pronunciation of the name \\"Ursula\\" in attempt to impress her older friend.   <br /> <br />     My criticism of the novel is there is not enough of a story to justify 300+ pages.  I think I might have enjoyed it more if it were 100 pages shorter, or even written as a novella.  On the other hand, Godwin is such a remarkable writer, that I always enjoy reading her, even if the book is somewhat slow-going.   <br /> <br />     If you are interested in reading Gail Godwin, I would recommend starting with \\"A Southern Family,\\" which is longer, but more compelling, and easier to get through. <br />	2005-03-18

I have always enjoyed novels where the author rotates the first person.  Here, Stuart O'Nan introduces nine flawed (blood-related) characters (five adults and four children) each of whom is dealing with a loss, secret or difficulty, in his or her life, over the course of one last week spent in a small summer cottage in upstate New York, that is about to be sold.  In relatively short chapters, the reader is placed in each character's mind (and even, briefly, into the dog!).  O'Nan gently encourages the reader to understand, if not quite sympathize, with each character. <br /> <br />     As pointed out by other reviews, O'Nan has a wonderful eye for detail, whether he is describing, for instance, a messy garage, or mist over a lake.  There are no action scenes that keeps one's eyes riveted to the page (indeed most of the book takes place inside the cottage), but I never grew bored with the book, and maintained my interest in re-visiting each character, and observing their continuing and evolving interaction with each other.  Although conflicts might not have been resolved (they rarely are in one week) nevertheless, most of the characters seem to obtain a greater sense of self by the end. <br /> <br />     If you enjoy this book, I would also recommend  \\"Wheel of Fortune,\\" \\"The Rich are Different,\\" and \\"Sins of the Fathers,\\" by Susan Howatch, and \\"A Southern Family,\\" by Gail Godwin, all of which use rotating first person narrative to great effect. <br />	2005-03-16

An intriguing idea: a conspiratorial science known as \\"cliology\\" where the future is predicted by complicated mathematical formulas (on a 19th century device, no less!).  Now which way will cliologists go?  For instance, will they use their skills merely to prepare for the future, or profit from it, or to try to change it.  Or, as here, will competing groups of cliologists have different agendas.  Add to the mix an attractive \\"super woman,\\" Sarah Beaumont, with her many exceptional skills and dogged pursuit of the truth, and you pretty much get the gist of \\"In the Country of the Blind,\\" a fast paced, page turning novel.   <br /> <br />      The problem is that Michael Flynn tries to do too much with the material he has to work with.  So many plots and sub-plots are introduced that I began to feel overwhelmed by the whole thing and often needed to turn back pages in order to follow all the characters.  Ultimately as well, I kept being reminded of all those financial analysts, who, no doubt, feel a certain ability to predict the future, and have largely been proven to be no better at it than the rest of us. <br /> <br />     I recommend this book to fans of both the science fiction and conspiracy thriller genres who have no trouble suspending disbelief.  And, as mentioned by several reviewers, if this subject is of interest to you, try the superior \\"Foundation\\" trilogy by the great Isaac Asimov.	2005-03-15

However, Palahniuk's point appears to be to lash out at society in general, and specifically at \\"the man,\\" in that his book is a violent, disturbing and subversive novel about conformity, and the apparent male need to pummel each other on a regular basis.  <br /> <br />     What possible satirical device is Palahniuk using by telling the reader how to make nitro-glycerin, or how easy it is for a waiter to get away with urinating in food served to patrons?  From his introduction, Palahniuk appears proud that young men, influenced by his book, are starting fight clubs all over the country. <br /> <br />     Obviously, the book has a great deal of resonance with many people.  I have to admit that it kept me turning pages.  However, I question Palahniuk's motivation in writing it, and just hope that people treat it as a satirical work, and not as a \\"how to\\" book.	2005-03-13

I am one of the few people that did not love \\"Fight Club,\\" though I found it to be unique and intriguing.  In \\"Choke,\\" you basically find the same Palahniuk formula: terse quirky writing; a main character who has serious problems and despises society (but has the ability to influence those around him), and off-beat disenfranchised side characters.  I really could not find any redeeming quality in Victor Mancini, though I appreciated that he was less violent than the narrator in \\"Fight Club.\\"         Palahniuk certainly writes in an an idiosyncratic voice, and can dream up some bizarre scenarios.  I just don't think he is all that great a writer, and this book isn't terribly interesting.  Perhaps in a future work, Palahniuk will finally include even one character who isn't quite so loathsome or insane, as everyone is in \\"Choke\\" (and in \\"Fight Club,\\" for that matter).	2005-03-13

Think Mike Judge's \\"Office Space\\" as being re-written by Stephen King, paying homage to \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\"  Throw in some H.G. Wells (the author frequently alludes to \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\\" and the relationship between the Eloi and Mordocks in the \\"Time Machine\\") and add some steamy love scenes, and you can get an approximation of James Hyne's off-the-wall \\"Kings of a Infinite Space.\\" <br /> <br />     Paul Trilby, a failed professor with a troubling past (especially with women and a cat named Charlotte) finds himself as a temp at the Texas Department of General Services, with some of the wackiest co-workers you will ever meet.  Along the way, he finds a fiery lover in Callie, the mail room girl.  Almost right from the start, Paul notices that things are not quite what they seem.  Paul attempts to distance himself from his unsettling surroundings, but gets increasingly drawn into it, especially by the bogus \\"Colonel\\" who, at one point, forces Paul to paticipate in a surrealistic Karaoke contest.   <br /> <br />     I felt that the author's frequent use of allegory was sometimes heavy handed, and the last portion of the book seemed too far over the top, as if Hynes were trying to convert a generally humorous novel into horror.  However, Hynes is a fine writer who has created something truly unique (although Stephen King and Clive Barker, to name two, could probably have written a similar book).  Therefore, I recommend \\"Kings of the Infinite Space,\\" and suggest you hold on tightly for the ride.	2005-03-12
US	14244739	R1KJ713V44VJE5	0802139922	190408686	The Warriors	Books	3	51	60	N	N	A real, instead of surreal, depiction of gang life	I was very excited to find this out of print book because  I, like many others, love the movie, which is about a small Coney Island based gang falsely accused of killing a messiah-like leader named Cyrus, who intends to unite all the gangs.  In the movie, the Warriors struggle to get back from the Bronx to home turf while being chased by various bizarre gangs (some of which are unforgettable) who are seeking revenge.  Other than Ajax, the members in the Warriors seem fairly decent and unthreatening.         The movie is based very loosely on the book, and certain scenes are roughly parallel.  However, Sol Yurick's goal is to portray the violence and banality of gang-life.  The principles (here called the \\"Coney Island Dominators\\") commit acts of shocking violence, including gang rape of a young woman, who, in the movie, is unscathed, and ends up as Swan's girlfriend.  At the end of the book, there is no dramatic scene on the beach where the truth is learned, but rather, the author spotlights one of the gang-members who is unable to satisfy his insatiable hunger, which I assume is a metaphor for an empty, meaningless life.          In sum, I recommend this book, but don't expect to read a script for the movie, which, to be honest, I enjoyed quite a bit more.	2005-03-11
US	14244739	R1X7Q7P35SMENG	1573222755	892958037	Symptomatic	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Single biracial female	Danzy Senna's novel \\"Symptomatic\\" is really two novels in one.  The first describes a young, attractive biracial female who is fighting a losing battle in her search for identity while living and working in New York City.  This is a struggle that many of us have faced at one time or another, and Senna does a fine job placing the reader into the psyche of the unnamed narrator who seems to be disconnected from the life that she is living.           The second part of the book is the narrator's relationship with another older biracial female, co-worker Greta Hicks, who takes an unnatural interest in the narrator's life, and becomes increasingly bizarre and downright psychopathic.  Although this character adds tension to the novel's atmosphere, I believe that the author might have been more concerned at this point about writing a Hollywood script as opposed to a superior novel.  That being said, I believe that Danzy Senna is a talented author, and I look forward to reading \\"Caucasia,\\" as well as her future offerings.	2005-03-10

No one writes quite like this hyperrealistic gothic southern writer, and no one can create such bizarre characters in so few pages.  Indeed, I have read \\"The Knockout Artist\\" several times, and always get something different out of it.  As always, Crews concerns himself with the larger questions in life, especially how to maintain one's moral compass in a surreal amoral world (here its New Orleans), but he also creates characters as compelling as one can find in late 20th century fiction. You will root for the main character and never forget those that he meets along the way.           To address one of the other reviews, in Crews' world, it is hardly surprising that there are people who would pay handsomely to see someone knock himself unconscious.  I am sure that in the underbelly of any major city, (which certainly would include New Orleans!) there are those who have desires far stranger than this.           I urge you to read this book.  If you like it, run out and buy \\"A Feast of Snakes,\\" which is just as good.	2005-03-10
US	14244739	RI0MTXXTYIDPW	0061057134	893664393	Titan (NASA Trilogy, Book 2)	Books	3	4	5	N	N	A description of Titan similar to the Huygens probe photos	Stephen Baxter is one of our best modern day hard science fiction writers, who, unfortunately, are a dying breed due to the dominance and popularity of serial fantasy novels (e.g. ten volumes of Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\").  Here, Baxter presents a bleak future indeed, which is perhaps unrealistic.  However, it would not be hard to imagine a time in the United States where anti-intellectualism and religious fundamentalism are held in higher esteem then rationality and science (some might say it has happened already!).         Baxter does a fine job depicting the dangers of long-term space travel, and the physical and psychological effects it might have on humans.  I once read, for instance, that in a manned Mars mission, the astronauts would have to vigorously exercise no less then four hours a day to prevent loss of bone and muscle mass (never mind the exposure to radioactive materials in space).  Although I thought the book felt too hopeless at times, and the ending was basically a rip-off of Arthur C. Clarke, I thought it was well worth it.  It would be interesting to know if Baxter would favor more spending for manned space flight, or un-manned probes, which seem to provide more science at far less cost.              One big plus in this books favor: Baxter's description of Titan's surface is almost identical to the findings of the Huygens space probe.           I do have two minor quibbles.  First, I doubt whether people would lose interest in such an extraordinary mission, as they did in the book, even if things were not going well on Earth.  Second, I can't believe that old parts from antiquated space ships and shuttles could ever have any use for a mission like this one, in that space flight technology has changed so dramatically.  Still, this is a worthwhile, albeit rather depressing, read.	2005-03-09

Yes, the book covers the obligatory topics of living in the suburbs, e.g. the superficiality, boredom and despondency of its residents, but Perrotta's imagination and writing style elevate this book from the typical fare.  It is remarkable, for instance, how the author can make the reader feel sympathy and revulsion for a character, sometimes simultaneously.  He seems to want the reader to begin to understand a character, but not necessarily to like or accept him or her.  A seemingly \\"normal\\" person will turn out to be completely bizarre.            I agree with one reviewer's comparison to the movie \\"American Beauty.\\"  That the suburbs may not really be accurately depicted is hardly important.  Perrotta is not trying to write a guide book, but rather an interesting piece of fiction in a certain setting.  I believe that he succeeds.	2005-03-08

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions	Books	2	7	20	N	N	pure fiction	What would the reviewers of \\"Bringing Down the House\\" have written if the book were discovered to be pure fiction, i.e. an MIT urban legend?  My guess, is most people would award at least one or two less stars.  True, there are some exciting scenes which drive one to turn pages, but I suspect the interest in, and praise of, this book is due primarily to the fact that people believe, or want to believe, the story about how these college students made a killing playing blackjack at various casinos, by using basic card counting techniques, and playing as a \\"team\\" (alerting the main player as to when the deck became slightly more favorable to the player).      I have played blackjack many many times and have never seen any decent player split tens under any circumstances, even with a \\"ten rich\\" deck and the dealer showing six.  With these players, this seems to be a common strategy .  Have you ever been to a casino on a typical Saturday night?  Could a seat be available for a \\"team player\\" to jump right in when the deck gets \\"ten rich\\"?  Have you ever seen anybody in the VIP section bouncing around from table to table like these players apparently did all the time?    The fact is that anyone can claim that he won big in a casino, but, unless that player is directly observed, or the contents of his wallet monitored, one simply cannot tell if he's telling the truth.  In other words, the claims made in this book are totally unverifiable, and most likely false.  (Isn't it interesting, for instance, how the main character makes tons of money at the tables, but seems to have difficulty paying his rent).    Alot of the reviewers say that they planned on using the card-counting techniques espoused in this book to clean up at the casinos.  Did anybody actually have success doing this (besides, of course, the casino owners, who probably enjoyed this book very much)?  I didn't think so.	2005-03-08

Carol Goodman is a good, but not great, writer, and her characters are often interchangeable and thinly drawn. Unfortunately, not nearly enough pages are devoted to the most intriguing character, Helen Chambers (which also reminds one of \\"The Secret History,\\" where one never gets to really know Julian, the instructor of the main characters).  That being said, however, the book is a taut page-turner that is quite absorbing and memorable, but it is difficult to see why anyone would can award it five stars (or one star for that matter). <br /> <br />     If you liked the constant suspense in this book, you will probably be somewhat disappointed with Goodman's second book, \\"The Seduction of Water\\" because it is much slower paced with large portions that do not seem to advance the plot. <br /> <br />	2005-03-07

Here, Clare, Ralph, Lily, Theo, Snow and others are feeling and thinking human beings who have positive and negative traits -- in other words, they are real people, living through a tragic and uncertain event.  Even though the book is rather long, I did not want to leave these people, even in their grief. <br /> <br />     If you enjoyed this book, I would also recommend Stuart O'Nan's \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" as well as three Susan Howatch books: \\"Wheel of Fortune,\\" The Rich are Different,\\" and \\"Sins of the Fathers,\\" which are all excellent examples of rotating the first person in each chapter (as is done here).	2005-03-07

Also, too many disparate things occur that fit together in the end.  However, it is interesting to read about police work and the legal system in a different country (Sweden) and how in what ways it is similar to (and different from) the U.S.  One minor quibble which I often find in these kind of books is that one would think that where the evidence strongly suggests a far-reaching world-wide conspiracy, the main character would \\"call in the cavalry\\" much sooner.	2005-03-05
