I coach individuals in emotional intelligence, but there are also men in my private life who resemble those in this book.   <br /> <br />Why, just the other day I had a date with a gentlemen who drove 100 miles to my town to take me out to dinner.  As we headed for a restaurant I knew well, in my hometown after all, that he had been to once, 5 years ago, he got lost and asked me not to say anything.  ??  \\"OK,\\" I said, \\"But it's right over there.\\"  I was, well, hungry.  He said no, it was not right over there.  After 20 minutes of driving in silence (\\"testosterone makes people silent\\"), he concluded that I \\"might be right\\" [if I'm RIGHT, he's WRONG] and permitted me to point out the restaurant just a few blocks away.  He asked me out again, and I declined.  He seemed to enjoy \\"hunting in silence\\" a lot more than I did.   <br /> <br />And this, said Gratch, is how men end up in therapy.  Only when they've driven themselves for a long time, and are totally lost will they ask directions, i.e., a busted relationship, getting fired, or some other crisis for which they can't find the map they wouldn't use if they had.  Yes, men are men.   <br /> <br />It's good to bear in mind though, as I tell clients to whom I recommend this book, that Gratch is talking about therapy clients.  This is not the \\"average\\" man, and since Gratch is psychoanalytic, I'll throw in that I think they seem to have more than their share of the designer ailment \\"narcissism.\\"   <br /> <br />That having been said, it's a thoroughly delightful book.  What you \\"do\\" with a man like this - who can't \\"talk,\\" but there's a lot more to it - is not so simple, but, yes, Virginia, if you're looking for anything \\"simple\\" in terms of human relations, you're going to be frequently disappointed.  You have to do a LOT of reading, and experiencing, but reading this book is a start.   <br /> <br />Dr. Gratch gives enough direct recommendations you could put into place in a relationship to give us hope, e.g., when he picks on you because his boss yelled at him/he lost the golf game/he's put on weight, tell him, \\"Come back when you have something nice to say\\" and LEAVE HIM WITH THE FEELING.  How else will he sort it out, and, more importantly, how else will you keep yourself relatively free of the projections?   <br /> <br />I found this book helpful in coaching men in emotional intelligence.  If you read the book carefully, you'll get a lot of Gratch's attitude, which is the key.  He manages to be sympathetic but confronting, and also to retain his curiosity, sense of humor, and compassion, as well as being able to keep himself from getting entangled in the embroglio, which is a skill you need with someone who's not mindful about their emotions.   <br /> <br />He does rely on the premise that it's their wishes to be feminine (or have the perceived advantages of being female) that should be considered.  I prefer to look at the wellness and success that comes from knowing your emotions and being able to talk about them, and from being balanced with a full repertoire of qualities - whether labeled \\"female\\" or \\"male.\\"  The more you have to draw on when it's needed, the better you'll do, the more interesting you'll be to others, and easier to be with, and your enjoyment of life will generally increase.  That's high EQ!	2005-06-14

I found this book not only brave, and fascinating, but credible and useful.  When I coach EQ, I keep running into the same impasses with men -- and women, but then, being female myself, women are more innately comprehensible to me in their management of emotions.  Not that women are any \\"better\\" - on an EQ assessment, men and women test about the same - in fact men score 2 points higher in overall EQ.  However, the genders vary significantly on the various competencies (such as empathy, social responsibility, and self-regard) and this book gives explanations as to why.  (And not to worry - the good news is that EQ can be learned.)  To put men on a spectrum toward autism is not implausible.  Read that women are hard-wired for emotion and conduct it like water conducts electricity, and you'll have a good working hypothesis for understanding the differences; and there are many in this book.  Yet we know that men are very emotional; it's just HOW are they, and WHY, and WHEN.  (Men and anger we know all about, the its detrimental effect on men's hearts).  Of course we always need to keep in mind that \\"the average man\\" doesn't exist, and his statistical attributes may or may not apply to the man sitting in front of you.  One of the most empathic and high-functioning individuals I know is a man.  And I can name at least one woman who \\"thinks\\", maybe even \\"feels,\\" like a man.  Whether you're interested in philosophy, brain science, understanding your mate or boss, or just a good read and to learn something new, this ia a very interesting book, and well-written, and it has lots of data.  Enjoy!	2005-06-14

As an Emotional Intelligence (EQ) Coach, I teach people to develop their emotional intelligence competencies, one of which is Intuition.  As Naparstek is so quick to point out -- we all have it, it's just a matter of developing it and using.  Now, the clients with relatively high Intuition already, know &quot;intuitively&quot; what it's all about.  But those other folks??  They're the ones who need a good scientific explanation (empirical evidence, upon which my coaching is based) to help them bridge the gap.  In a field such as coaching, empirical evidence (scientific fact) is rare.  This gave me just what i needed, has helped me develop  my own Intuition and stay safer.

Applying the techniques of acting to the business world makes for better public speakers is the thesis of this book and it's a good one.  I'm a coach and have done a lot of public speaking, and this book pointed out many ways I could improve my presentation.  I also coach other people about public speaking, and I'll be recommending this book to them.<br />Rehearsing well ahead of time, they recommend, so that you aren't 'rehearsing nervousness' which is what will happen if you go on stage unrehearsed each time. Good point!  <br />The parts I really enjoyed were their treatments of the kind of phoniness you sometimes feel.  They point out that there's nothing phony about real acting -- it's not cheap theatrics.  A real actor finds the truth in the situation and brings many different aspects of himself to his role and lives it as honestly as he can within the fictional parameters of the play.  &quot;A good speaker does the same within the parameters of the speech.&quot;<br />&quot;Play the full range,&quot; they say.  &quot;Every human being possesses all 88 keys on the piano, but most of us restrict our melodies to the middle octave.&quot;  This book will show you how to play all over the keyboard!

I think of my gentle son who loved the Pacific Rim so much and manifested so many of their values.  It's a truly loving culture, and love, Pearsall points out, is not a feeling, but a way of treating someone that takes infinite patience and practice to learn and to develop.  &quot;Only the very patient should marry,&quot; he says, &quot;for it takes a very long time to learn to love someone.&quot;  Marriage to the Polynesians is forever and one test of a pleasurable relationship is that it makes your family and your world a better place.  Pearsall's thoughts on anger were especially welcome.  Somehow I always &quot;knew&quot; that expressing anger was not the answer to anything, having been assaulted and sickened by outbursts from others, but rather it puts out a negative forcefield for everyone involved that spreads like ripples in a stream.  His Myths about Anger should be read by all.  Full of kind words and aloha, this book will warm your soul and give you the courage to live the way your heart and soul know they should in a world that hasn't accepted it yet.  Be you, be well, be in lokahi (unity), be the first.  I deeply recommend this book.  Don't be fooled by the simplicity.  The philosophy will take up residence in your heart, which needs it badly.	2001-09-15

When I think back on those joyous and turbulent times when my sons were teenagers, things were never too clear, but Judi Craig, Ph.D., MCC is an experienced clinical psychologist and professional coach ...who writes with exceptional clarity.  She manages to pull apart the tangled threads of teen-parent relating and show them to you, one by one, which is particularly important because when they come at you in real life, they&#8217;re going to be coming in confusing combinations.  She&#8217;s also the mother of three grown children, so she&#8217;s been in the trenches and knows whereof she speaks.  I know I&#8217;m supposed to believe that someone can know about teens who hasn&#8217;t raised one, but I don&#8217;t.<br />Craig points out right away something that&#8217;s often missing in parental advice books &#8211; there&#8217;s a warp and a woof to the fabric &#8211; there&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on with the teenager, and then there&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on with the parent(s).   &#8220;What&#8217;s Really Happening with Parents of Teens?&#8221; addresses the developmental stages the parents are going through, which impact on the relationship.  When you&#8217;re clear about yourself, you can handle the storms of teen emotions better.  <br />Full of concrete advice, this book gives you specific suggestions for real-life situations that really work.  She helps you keep your head about you and distinguish what's imprtant and what isn't:  &#8220;If your teen does not seem to be unduly affected by his musical choices,&#8221; she writes, &#8220;and basically remains his usual self, there&#8217;s probably no reason to raise the issue and create a potential power struggle.  On the other hand, if his new musical heroes seem to be part of a negative new identity, it would be wise to intervene&#8230;not all loud music that teens love contains objectionable content.&#8221;  <br />She has a way of disarming loaded issues that makes the information a lot easier to absorb.  Her chapter on the &#8220;S&#8221; word begins, &#8220;If there&#8217;s one issue that is guaranteed to bring anxiety to both parents and teens, it&#8217;s sex!&#8221;  Somehow that statement allows you to read further, and you need to read further.<br />Read this book before your children become teens, and keep it on your bedside table when they are.  If you counsel or coach, keep it in your office.  It&#8217;s upbeat, common-sense advice, and you&#8217;re going to need it!	2001-09-13

You can't help but notice people with high IQs and excellent educations who just don't seem to be able to make it in the work world, and who aren't really going to subject themselves to traditional analysis or deep exploration of their psychodynamics to explore the reasons why, nor am I equipped to deliver it. Fear of success? Deep-seated authority conflicts? This book gave me something I could really USE. It's written for the public, but we are the public, and those of us who work in the helping professions are working with the public. It generally boils down to the fact that the person simply doesn't know how to get along. They don't read social cues. They can't tell when to talk and when not to. They alienate people and have abrasive personalities. They zig when they should zag. In the dance of interpersonal relationships, they're stepping all over other people's toes. And they keep digging themselves in deeper. I believe the vernacular is that they're &quot;clueless.&quot; (If you want to see the sad extreme of this, read about Asperger's Syndrome.) The most important news in the book is that EQ is not fixed at birth, but rather can be developed over the lifespan, and generally does. The author tells you why, and how, and what you can do about it. It's especially important to read this book if you have children and care about their future. Can they save their raisins for Sunday? It will matter later on in life.	2001-09-10

How this book helped me as I soothe, challenge, question, and grope to learn of the person on the other end of the line and what will serve them best.<br />Orpheus is on the cover. Ah, Orpheus, whose golden voice could <BR>move rock, change the course of streams.<br />This book, lyrical and profound, is an ode to sound, and to listening. &quot;The universe is more like music than like matter,&quot; said physicist Donald Hatch Andrews. I know that I've been hurt by sound, by harsh voices and criticism, and that I've been healed by sound, by soothing tones and kind words. Dr. Kittelson explained to me how and why.<br />This book explains in detail the mechanics of sound production and reception -- the scientific explanations -- and discusses this in light of &quot;the talking cure,&quot; but it is at the same time almost mystical, for this is the stuff of deep speaking and profound listening. &quot;The client uses the therapist's ways of listening,&quot; Kittelson says, &quot;to learn to hear himself.&quot; &quot;In both music and psychotherapy,&quot; she continues, &quot;timeliness is of the essence. It is a matter of timing, a matter of tact.&quot; Resonant communication takes care and time and space, and while the client sets the basic pace, the therapist exerts some influence too, in the musical duet.<br />Auditory processes, she says, have a special resonance in early work. Auditory experience is primary in infancy -- it is a time before sight matters when sound, movement and skin contact are most important. &quot;In early work,&quot; she says, &quot;the client's experience of the therapist's voice is highly influential. Soemtimes it will be the most basic mode of attunement.&quot;<BR>This is a beautifully written book about a profound subject. &quot;I call to you/I call to you/But I don't call soft enough&quot; said L. Cohen in &quot;There Ain't No Cure for Love,&quot; and Kittelson, a Jungian analyst,calls softly indeed. <br />She &quot;likes to figure things out,&quot; it says on the back of the book. She's my kind of person. What a gentle soul. What a tender voice. Read this book. You'll be touched, and, like a tuning fork, you will resonate.	2001-09-03

As far as I'm concerned, Dr. Stark is the most gifted writer in the field. She's a teacher! I understand that her courses are in demand, and I can see why. She's a graduate of Harvard Medical School and the Boston Psychoanalytical Institute who can write for people who aren't! <br />Synthesizing the major theories in psychotherapy, she normalizes the process of healing which tends to go, well, like the illustration on the cover of the book. We fight those who caringly try to change us, and we fight ourselves. It's a struggle! <br />As a professional coach (personal, not sports), as a parent, as a friend, I've relied on the depth of understanding this book gave me about a phenomenon which can be pervasive and frustrating in relationships with others. It helped me see my own resistances and helped me see how to work with others'. <br />Through the book shines Dr. Stark the therapist -- there's not one hint of the arrogance or patronization one finds in some therapy books, but rather the sincere compassion, tact and respect of a seasoned professional who loves her work.<br />It takes patience to deal with resistance, and you have to understand the nature of the beast. &quot;Back and forth,&quot; she says, &quot;back and forth, over and over again. Systematically, repeatedly, again and again. This is what is meant by working through the resistance. It is a process requiring that the therapist demonstrate to the patient the same thing again and again, at different times, and in various connections. Here too. Here now. Here also.&quot;<br />As one of the reviewers on the cover of the book said, &quot;Martha Stark ... is able to clarify without sacrificing complexity.&quot; Read this book for the best description of working with resistance you're likely to find, and it is through working through the resistance that healing takes place.	2001-09-03

The nomenclature for the strengths is wonderful, and makes sense. As a helping professional, I can generally see what's going on with a client, but can't see the forest for the trees, and wasn't that easily able to describe my own strengths. Taking the test myself was most illuminating and I found out, with some feedback, that I wasn't really portraying my stengths in relations with others. I immediately compared it with the profile of someone I was working with, and it made it clear to us both the one area in which we were 'clashing'. Tension eased as we saw each other for what we were, and it's been smooth sailing. It's a shortcut to understand the person you're managing, relating to, living with, or working with. No single assessment is going to explain a complex living being, but this one will put together a lot of pieces for you and for your client, employee or S.O. The book is very easy to read; clear, well written and informative. Yes, we DID need words for strengths. It's time we quit focusing on &quot;weaknesses&quot;. Everyone has them, but everyone also has strengths, and, as the authors say, your best chance at attaining excellence is by increasing your strengths, not shoring up your weaknesses, and it's also a much surer path to contentment.	2001-09-03

So much of what he &quot;knows&quot; he knows in retrospect, but such is the stuff of case histories.  Meanwhile, when you're together, the dance goes on!  What I liked especially about this book is that he makes an attempt to be humble in the presence of his patients; an attempt anyway. If you've ever been in the helping professions, and can get your ego out of the way, that's just the way it is.  You get your degree, you read and read, you have your own analysis or whatever, but what comes up in the therapy room never seems to have been covered in the text books.  So you learn-as-you-go.  His carefully delineated case histories take you step-by-step through the complicated process, and you will learn a lot from this book -- if nothing else you can take heart that it's a very complicated &quot;dance&quot; indeed.

We're talking about people and their lives after all.  <br />&quot;Historically,&quot; they continue, &quot;impossibility has been located in the client.&quot;  And the self-fulfillingness of the diagnosis of &quot;impossible&quot; is also discussed.  You can see they aren't afraid to take on sacred elephants!<br />In case after actual case, they show how optimism, flexibility and meeting client's needs can bring success, giving such obvious-and-therefore-overlooked advice as &quot;What the client wants from treatment may be the single most important piece of information that can be obtained.&quot;<br />Full of optimisim and fresh approaches (&quot;It is the unpredictability of client methods and accomplishments that makes this work fun.&quot;) that rather go against traditional methods -- well these cases are considered &quot;impossible&quot; because others have tried and failed -- they encourage the practitioner to be different and try new things.  And it isn't just theory _ they give plenty of concrete examples of how-to.<br />But to me the best thing about the book is their deep, abiding respect for people as individuals, not cases.  As one client wrote after therapy, &quot;...it was your believing in me, that I was a person and not a patient ... a person with potential and worth.&quot;  <br />&quot;Looking beyond labels and giving clients the benefit of a doubt is critical with psychotherapy veterans,&quot; say the authors.  They challenge helpers to move beyond labels, to replace history with a &quot;competing experience of acceptance and validation&quot; and &quot;watch what clients can really do.&quot;  <br />If you're a beginner, this book is for you.  If you're a worn-down veteran, this book is especially for you.  And if you're in between, it is also for you.	2001-09-03

The aim of the treatment, he states, is to &quot;enhance the patient's ability to experience self and others as coherent, integrated, realistically perceived individuals, and to reduce the need to use defenses that weaken ego structure by reducing the repertoire of available responses.&quot;<br />He covers all the bases, with clarity and authority -- the Principles of Treatment, the Phases of Treatment, and Common Complications. The book ranges from theoretical to very didactic -- there's a chapter called &quot;Conducting a Session&quot; that is very illuminating. Kernberg, who is an expert in the field, doesn't let you down in this instructive book on a notorously difficult subject. What strikes me most about his book, and about him, are his hard-hitting clarifications, confrontations and interpretations.<br />To one patient he says, &quot;I am impressed by your telling me that you shared your new slides with the very person you have been suspecting of plagiarizing other researchers' work.&quot;<br />To another he says, &quot;I think you have been trying to provoke me into an argument in order to protect yourself against the emergence of sexual fantasies about me. What do you think about this?&quot;<br />To another, &quot;Whipping prostitutes and acting tough with me have similar functions...&quot;<br />One gets the idea that he is relentless in pursuit of therapeutic healing. You can read his book and learn, but the question is, can you do the actual therapy as he does.<br />I highly recommend this book for an understanding of the treatment of borderlines -- the challenges, the goals, the actualities of the treatment room, the countertransference pitfalls and opportunities, the intense, chaotic transferences,and the forms of resistance.	2001-09-03

Tansey and Burke take on the very complex phenomenon of &quot;projective identification&quot; and make it clear, well as clear as it can be, what happens and why. Since we're all victims of the projections of others, you can hardly learn too much about it. It's very important to know the differences between empathy, countertransference and p.i. and really good to be able to negotiate among them. I'm a professional coach, so I do get involved with people in depth, and this book has helped me tremendously to deal with various forms of interpersonal press and remain effective as a helper. It's grounded in actual theapeutic practice and is invaluable.	2001-09-03

In my coaching practice, I sometimes have to grapple with another person's innate and deeply-grounded pessimism and this book gave me ammunition.  I do believe that optimism can be learned and in my efforts to extend my own and other people's optimism in the face of some bad-to-worse onslaughts from life, this book has been of immeasurable help.  From the amygdala to dream analysis, Vaughan makes it all almost deceptively simple.  I doubt that many can &quot;do it&quot; as well as she can, but learning about changing one's level of optimism -- in fact just knowing that we can -- is a great first step!  This book gave me real information I can put into practice.	2001-09-03

Myths tell us of the collective unconscious and lead us into symbolic thinking, and this book has so much to offer.  I've read it more than once!

In Chapter 3, he examines the controvery between borderline syndrome and the affective disorders, and moves on in Chapter 4 to present an overview of therapy. Chapter 5 focuses on the disturbances in cognitive style and emotional intensity and Chapter 6 takes up victimization and and intolerance of aloneness. In Chapter 7, he considers medication, and then in Chapter 8 discusses the effects of borderlines on the therapist and where the responsbility lies, e.g. the notorious countertransference brought about by borderlines.<br />At times Kroll comes off as patronizing, but on the whole this just emphasizes how difficult therapy with borderlines can be. In fact Kroll mentions in several places that some are good with borderlines, and others aren't. There are some places where he shines, such as when, in discussing the stresses of dealing with chronic suicide threats, he says, &quot;Therapy cannot proceed when the therapist is more anxious than the patient.&quot; It is also reassuring when he says, &quot;While it is part of the patient's longstanding psychopathology to get others to become so anxious about him that they lose perpective of what is a proper response, it is part of my longstanding psychopathogy to move in too fast and take over.&quot; It's a dance ... and who's leading who? Therapy with a borderline is notoriously difficult, and Kroll doesn't dodge that issue.<br />Kroll ends by saying, &quot;The challenge for the psychotherapist is to be able to use his or her own personality in the therapeutic process in a manner that facilitates competence and growth in the patient.&quot; Kroll cleary believes competence and growth can be facilitated in the borderline patient, and does a good job of telling you how this can be brought about!	2001-09-03

I'm a coach (personal, business and EQ, not sports!) and I keep this book handy. I direct my clients to Vince Lombardi's philosophy and strength, and to this book, which is just a wonderful compilation of all that he was about. I use quotes from this book often in my ezines. I especially like what his players said about him because when you're in the 'coaching' position -- be it coach, parent, manager, counselor, mentor or whatever, it's good to remember that &quot;His enthusiasm, his spirit, was infectious.&quot; --Frank Gifford and &quot;He prepared us so well, and he motivated us so well, I felt he was a part of me on the field.&quot; -- Fuzzy Thurston. In reading about this great man, this great coach, I'm humbled and revitalized. He helped so many people reach their potential.  This book is almost my daily inspirational!	2001-09-03

I lost 65 pounds okay?? <br />I'm a Type B. Once I cut the beef out of my diet, and the wheat, and felt freed from feeling I had to eat chicken, which I suppose I intuitively can't stand though it's the diet-cure all, I had so much more energy. I also understood why a bowl of pasta just knocks me out. No carbohydrate loading for me if it contains wheat! The weight didn't exactly fall off. It took a lot of work, particularly hunting down places that served turkey and lamb, but they're out there, and it was sure worth it. The weight loss was great, but the way it made me feel was the real payoff. I no longer felt sleepy, my joints didn't ache, I look (so I'm told) and feel years younger. This prompts me to exercise more and take better care of myself, which takes energy after all.<br />The theory? For one thing, it's quite based in scientific data. Read all about it. For another, if you have an inquiring mind, you have to wonder why there are just the few blood types we have when there are so many people.<br />The theory is fascinating. The diet is super. It's a fantastic book that can, I hate to say it, yes, folks, change your life. It sure did for me.<br />It's especially important if you're a parent. My son needs, and can tolerate, lots of beef and now I know why. When they're little, children can't speak for themselves, and so we either feed them what we're told to, which is the pediatrician's prescribed diet for everyone -- when everyone isn't alike -- or what we ourselves like. Either way it doesn't speak to the individuality of the child, or necessarily give him the nutrition he needs. I'm a coach (personal, not sports) and I recommend this book to my clients -- and everyone else.  I'm kind of a walking advertisement for it.	2001-09-03

Until you read this book! It gently tells you why and how and what to do about it.  Best of all I liked that it  finally -- after years of this &quot;co-dependency&quot; stuff -- gives us permission to need people and to depend upon them.  There may be a right and a wrong way to do this, depend upon someone, but, as they so judiciously point out, we are mammals, with limbic brains, and we need to be in relationship with other people.  I even look at my Lab differently now; my lab who comes and pushes her head into my lap when I cry. How does she know?  What makes her do this?  Read this book and find out!! I use this book to be a better personal coach in my practice, and I recommend it to my clients.  It made me look at things differently.  Well-written, clear, concise and full of new stuff you can really use.  What more can you ask for in a book?	2001-09-03

On the first reading it will all seem so simple.  Then you'll get lost.  When you come back to it, you'll wonder how he could make such a complicated subject so simple, but he does.  I think you have to get a firm grasp on the fundamentals -- to the point where they are bedrock innate -- before you can (if ever you can) take off on your own as a helper, and Weinberg is pretty clear about the fundamentals. I wonder if anyone really practices therapy this way any more.	2001-09-03

Whether or not you &quot;believe&quot; in primal scream, so much of what he writes about just rings true to common sense. One reason what he writes is hard to take, I think, is that some things about birthing are so beyond our control, even if we're a caring parent, e.g., if you have to have a baby by c-section, you have to. But there's still all the time of infancy and onward -- &quot;Touching a child allows for greater density of synapses in the developing brain,&quot; he writes, &quot;the more dense the synapses the more information the brain can handle.&quot; Whether you agree with what he says, or you don't, he makes his point (and it's extremely well annotated) and you won't walk away untouched. Read the chapter called &quot;The Gate-Control Theory.&quot; Wow!	2001-09-03

See if you can figure this out:  &quot;It obviously makes as difference whether we consider ourselves as pawns in a game whose rules we call reality or as players of the game who know that rules are 'real' only to the extent that we have created or accepted them, and that we can change them.&quot;  This is pretty much what this book is about.  And this, &quot;When a person enters therapy, he is fully entrenched in a dilemma:  what he wishes to attain has become all the more important and urgent ... and because of this urgency it is all the more important that no risk of falure be involved in the eventual action.&quot;  Complex stuff.  I read it once, and now I'm back to read it again.  It's hard to absorb it all the first time even though you know you're reading some pretty radical stuff that you probably ought to be acting upon!	2001-09-03

How do you convince a terrified patient to endure therapy, she asks, and answers with Lacan's &quot;with supply we create demands&quot;. To some degree or another, we've all been hurt, abused, neglected and she clarifies how to keep a relationship &quot;grounded, so that it does not become ambiguous and terrifyingly open to unfounded assumptions&quot; so that the relators do not lose touch with one another. The answer is in attending to the sublest interactions and clarifying the immediate moment -- in other words being fully present with the other and talking about what's going on. Easily said!  How rarely put into practice!  For those of us in the helping professions, this book in invaluable, but it probably would benefit anyone interested in the intricacies of human relationships. For someone as erudite as she, Dr. Ehrenberg writes very clearly.  I will put much of this into use in my coaching practice and also my personal life.	2001-09-03

We're shifting from left-brain thinking to right-brain thinking and Schlain does an excellent job of describing what's happening and why. This is a romp through recorded history. He makes some indefensible &quot;leaps&quot; at times, but that's a writer's prerogative. His writing is delightful. I especially like the way he eases you into controversial ideas. Every time I came to one of his, &quot;Just consider the possiblity, for a moment,&quot; I smiled. He takes on some BIG ideas and goes right after it. I like a person who takes on some of the beasts in our collective history without temerity. What is life but to be looked at -- our personal life, or the recorded history of life. This is one of those serendipitous books that will teach you many things - history, art, religion, politics, economics, philosophy, psychology all as a spoonful of sugar. I hope he'll write more.	2001-09-03

Landrum has figured out 8 key behavioral traits critical to success that the truly great possess -- and says they can be learned.  His descriptions of great people according to these traits, such as charisma, self-confidence, drive and intuition are fascinating and illuminating.  He doesn't hold back on what the downside of some of these traits are, and some of those descriptions were sobering.  A taxonomy of &quot;greatness,&quot; it's a wonderful read.  It's worth reading just to know that when he considered starting Disneyland, Disney had to go against the recommendations of his Board of Directors and experts such as the Stanford Research Institute.  All the reasons they gave why the park would fail, turned out to be the reasons why it succeeded.  Uh oh!	2001-09-03

This book put me light years ahead and is near the top of my list of books which have influenced my way of looking at things. I'm a Strategic Thinker, so I see patterns where others see chaos. My knowledge of physics was minimal, my appreciation of art immense. I now have a greater appreciation for both physicists and artists.  This book brings it all together! It boggles my mind that a physician can write so well. I liked this book so much, I went through it page by page looking up all the paintings he mentions on the net and putting together my own &quot;study guide&quot; which I've shared with other people who then want to read the book. Fascinating insights, well written, a true mind-expander.  My only regret is that the publishers didn't put in more and more of the art he talks about.	2001-09-03

There are as many ways of coaching as there are coaches, and this delineates one succinct method to follow in a relatively new, unregulated, and confusing field. The numerous pages of &quot;tools&quot; are worth the money alone. Wish I hadn't spent what I spent on a CD to get other versions. The skills and techniques affirm what I've been doing already, but push me onward with conviction, adding layers to my understanding of how to be most effective. It's the clearest description of coaching I've come across and I recommend it highly. It's well written, authoritative and highly useable.	2001-09-03
