As a Freddie fan there were many things I learned from this book that I never would have known through his movies. Even if you aren't a Freddie fan it's still an interesting story to read. I also recommend the biography of Freddie written by Marc Shapiro. That one is a little more  detailed and also worth reading.	2000-04-24

Rachel Vail really seemed to know what it is like to be 13 or 14 years old. It was a great book and I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I have read books that are similar to this book but were better. However, Ever After is a book that deserves some sort of recognition. Often adults attempt to  &quot;relate&quot; to teens and tehy fail miserably, but this book was  well-written in that respect.	2000-04-24

I would give it 4 and a half if I could. I enjoyed this book because it is informative about adoption but at teh same time it has an intriging story going on at the same time involving a pregnant teenager and her relationship with the  adoptive family of her yet-to-be-born child. However, I didn't understand  the actions of many of the characters. It wasn't taht the book was  confusing, it was just that it was hard to relate to the charcters. They  were somewhat unrealistic but overall I think this book is worth reading.	2000-04-24

I never used to read teen romance books because I thought they were totally corny. However, after reading many of the books in this series including &quot;Max and Jane&quot; I have changed my mind. This book is about a unlikely pair who don't realize that the perfect person for them is  standing right in front them. Although its perdictible (aren't all  romances? , its totally worth reading.	2000-04-24

It deals with issues that most people overlook in life. This book really makes you think twice about how to live your life and how to treat people. Although this may sound corny, i'll say it anyway. This book is a life-changing experience. I will never forget the  things I learned from this book. And although the actions at the ned of the  book of the main character &quot;Marina&quot; didn't make sense to me, it  was still a book that deserves to be on the &quot;must read&quot; list.	2000-04-23

I don't know where Robert Cormier went to high school, but it simply isn't the way he made it seem. This is a typical book where an adult writer tries to &quot;understand&quot; or portray teenage life. I think Robert Cormier failed to do this. However, the book  did have a few good parts that made you think. I have read other books by  the same author and they are well written but this one just wasn't the  same.	2000-04-11

I haven't laughed so much after reading  a Young Adult book. This book is not only funny, but also serious. It won a  well deserved, young adult fiction award.  Throughout the book, their are  many relationships that come up (mother-daughter, father-daughter etc.)  that really make you think about life in a new way. Not to sound corny,  but, after reading this book, it made me realize that stepping over  obstacles in life, is really what life is about.  Read this book.... you  might be suprised about what you find out about yourself.	2000-03-24

Not only is it funny but it is definitly a book you can read over and over again. This book is definitly isn't a typical romance novel. The main character is a six foot tall girl who is revolted by the idea of romances. It's definitly a funny and interesting story to  read. I think Louise Plummer has really made an awesome peice of work.	2000-03-14
