In LUNAR PARK, a famous writer named \\"Bret\\" -  whose books happen to have the same titles as the \\"real\\" Bret Easton Ellis - tries to find suburban happiness with a movie star wife and their estranged son in upstate New York. Almost immediately, unexplained events (a stuffed bird come to life, weird email) in the house lead Bret to believe that his dead father is trying to communicate with him and that his son may be in danger. <br /> <br />After a brief, funny, chapter recounting Bret's drug-soaked life to this point, most of LUNAR PARK is the story what ultimately becomes Bret's desperate attempt to deal with his feelings about his father and save his new family. Depending on your level of cynicism, this novel is either filled with regret at missed connections or a sendup of popular genre fiction tropes. The uncynical interpretation would lead one to believe that Ellis regards himself as totally devoid of value as a human being and incapable of sustaining the most basic of human relationships.... <br /> <br />....still, the guy can write. Even though I think the story gets away from Ellis in the end - I'm still confused about the fate of Ellis' son - his spiteful descriptions of overmedicated kids and unhappy parents kept me reading. LUNAR PARK is shot through, though with a yearning to be part of that community, or any community.  <br /> <br />A difficult, problematic, novel....one best appreciated by those familiar with Ellis' other work.

Blackford Oakes novel, the veteran CIA operative is dispatched to Reagan-era Moscow to thwart a plot to assassinate Gorbachev. The plot is half-baked, but Oakes unexpectedly finds himself involved in both romantic entanglements, in a network of dissatisfied Russian scientists, and in confronting the traitorous Kim Philby. <br /> <br />The best thing about this book is the depiction of Oakes, a man who realizes he's about to embark on the last chapter of his life. His passion for Ursina, the Russian doctor he falls for, is convincingly presented as a final grasp at youth. I was less impressed with the scenes of Russian bureaucrats bickering with each other (firmly standard issue) or with the cameos by real-life figures (Graham Greene, Ronald Reagan). Buckley has no insight into Philby, who comes off as merely a mustache-twirling villain. <br /> <br />Still, although a bit long-winded, this is a good read for anyone with a love of spy novels or an interest in CIA lore.  <br /> <br />	2005-08-05

After making a small scale return to playing at a charity event, Sara discovers a dead body...the body of a man she never met.  <br /> <br />The central plot of FUNERAL MUSIC revolves around Sara's emotional recovery...the circumstances of her breakdown are reveealed late, although many readers will probably figure it out early on. Meanwhile, Sara's involvement in the murder case is tangiental, driven by the fact that people tell her things almost constantly.....especially the hunky police offer whose marriage is on the rocks and loves the cello.  <br /> <br />There almost no suspense in FUNERAL MUSIC, and much of the book is taken up with descriptions of interior design or food preparation......I'm not quite sure where this series can go.	2005-07-31

Harry, reunited with old partner Kiz, is working a Cold Case unit with the (tentative) endorsement of the new police chief. The case the book centers around is the murder of a teenage girl 17 yrs ago. It apperars to be a straightforward whodunit, but it turns out the case has implications for LAPD politics and soon Bosch's nemesis Deputy Chief Irving is on the scene.  <br /> <br />If you are not familiar with Connelly's Bosch series, this may not be the best novel to start with. Quite a bit of time is spent on procedure (all excellently depicted) and less time on the tumult that is Harry's life. I was a little disappointed that Harry's elusive wife Eleanor and their daughter were not stronger in this book, as I wanted to see how fatherhood might change Harry. Still, Bosch's investigative skills are on display and Connelly expertly builds the case to a harrowing conclusion.  <br /> <br />Connelly diehards will of course love this.....I recommend that newcomers start with the earlier books and get to know Bosch and the city that runs through his veins...

The plot concerns three high school seniors, best friends for years, and what happens when three of them meet in a bathroom and one of them has a gun....The crime is investigated by a skilled detective, who quickly realizes all is not as it seems, but this is more than just a whodunit.  <br /> <br />Lippman takes us deep inside the world of young girls, the social hierarchy, the betrayals and shifting alliegances, all of it....the novel shifts between several points of view (only one, an ex-boyfriend, feels extraneous) and if there is an overriding theme to this sprawling and slightly pessimistic book it is the near-impossibility of real communication between adult and child. Hopefully TO THE POWER OF THREE will win Lippman a wider audience and put her up with the Lehanes and Connellys in the top tier of popular mystery writes.....This is Lippman's MYSTIC RIVER, a look at violence itself......Highly recommended....	2005-07-05

They don't jump, obviously, and form a sort of support group dedicated to making sure they all stay alive.... <br /> <br />With the exception of Maureen, who is forlorn after years of caring for a severely retarded child, it's easy to see why these people might want to kill themselves.....nobody likes them because they're incredibly annoying.....Martin (Tv host jailed for sex crime) seems to find it inexplicable that no one likes him....Jess (cabinet minister's daughter) takes out her jealousy over her missing sister with profanity and impulsive behavior, and JJ (failed rocker) is just unhappy. Maureen is a bit more symathetic, but so befuddled by the ways of modern life you'd think she'd come through a time warp.  <br /> <br />IF Hornby is trying to parody the kind of story where everything is resolved with hugs and life lessons, he has succeeded....the only problem is, I could easily imagine 3 out of 4 of these characters poised to jump again next Dec. 31....	2005-06-21

Quite a bit of the eraly part of the book is devoted to the PULP FICTION-created cult of Quentin Tarantino, and QT lovers (or haters) will find some information that I didn't know about regarding Tarantino's upbringing - not as white trash as has been supposed. Waxman makes a pretty good case that Tarantino's greatest gift is as a synthesizer of other people's ideas, not a creator - and that Roger Avary deserves some credit for PULP FICTION.  <br /> <br />The other directors are Soderbergh, David O. Russell, Spike Jonze, David Fincher, and Paul Thomas Anderson. Although Waxman clearly admires all of them, she also reports unflinchingly on their egos, bad personal relationships, on set battles, and conflicts w/ studio execs, who are almost unanimously depicted as Luddites.  <br /> <br />The biggest flaw in the book is the overhyping of David Fincher and FIGHT CLUB. Waxman almost goes into convulsions trying to find profundity in this nonsense, in which young men beat each other up and commit acts of terror for no reason. There's nothing in Fincher's other work to suggest he deserves this kind of company. (Alexander Payne, for one, has achieved much greater artistic heights in the same number of films.) <br /> <br />I recommend this book for movie fans whose subscription to PREMIERE just isnt enough....	2005-03-08

The plot, which is told from two points of view, involves a series of ritual murders in Miami investigated by Cuban-American detective Jimmy Paz. Paz knows the crimes have a \\"voodoo\\" connection but his own disdain for Santeria colors his thinking. The other central character is an anthropologist named Jane Doe, whose bizarre experiences in Africa may hold the key to the murders. Third person chapters alternate between Jane and Jimmy's POV, while Jane's African journal is woven in.  <br /> <br />Now to the upsetting part: the murders are being committed by Jane's husband Witt, a well-known African American writer (no spoilers, this is revealed early on)...We're asked to believe that a successful, intellectual, African-American writer would travel to Africa and IMMEDIATELY fall under the spell of African religions....Did Denzel Washington join the Nation of Islam after playing Malcolm X? For that matter, every nonwhite character in this book except Paz comes under the influence of either Santeria or African religion.....Despite this flaw, which bothered me progressively more as I read, I enjoyed this intellectual thriller....Be Careful Mr. Gruber......	2005-02-19

The plot involves a drifter named Constantine who stumbles into a half-baked liquor store robbery run for no good reason by a man named Grimes. There's really no reason Constantine can't leave at any time except for his attraction to Grimes' girlfriend.  <br /> <br />All of the Pelecanos trademarks are here - Washington, DC....old soul music....drug use described into detail, etc. While I enjoyed SHOEDOG, it lacks the thematic richness of some Pelecanos' Derek Strange books and the conclusion was somewhat unsatisfying....All of the characters, except Constantine, are pretty one-dimensional.... <br /> <br />If you've read Pelecanos' other books this will be a fun diversion, but RIGHT AS RAIN might be a better place to start for the novice.....	2004-12-28

Straub manages to encompass ghosts, pedophilia, serial killers, a haunted house, creepy visions, and a gratuitous Magnetic Fields reference. This book isnt very scary at all and the characters are too shallow to register with us emotionally. Mark, the boy, is a cluster of teen cliches.

The St. James' have previously been supporting characters, and I enjoyed seeing them take centre stage here, particularly Deborah, who is easily the best written female George has ever created. Deborah begins to question her relationship with Simon and her life goals over the course of the book and I'm interested to see where she might go. <br /> <br />I had been troubled for a while by the misogyny that pervades George's work, particularly in the person of the here-absent Havers, who can't go out the front door without George insulting her clothes. Besides Deborah, every other woman in the book is domineering, clingy, obsessive , or otherwise one-dimensional. <br /> <br />The mystery itself is decidedly less than it appears, as the victim is really a        and the murderer's motive is shaky at best.  <br /> <br />I did enjoy the information about and obvious affection for Guernsey, although as usual there's too much.

I admired much of the writing in this book, but I thought Adams' inability to bring life to her protagonist at certain key points prevented this book from fully working for me.  <br /> <br />Some of the strongest scenes are early on, where Aziz (an ex-soldier from Algeria) jumps off a ship and swims into Boston Harbor. Of course, Aziz doesn't know the language and isn't in good health, and Adams does a wonderful job conveying his sensory disassociation from the world around him. Aziz never really loses that disassociation though, it's as if he spends much of the novel with earplugs on. Even when he's reunited with friends and later his brother, and begins to suss out what he thinks may be a terrorist plot, Aziz seems remarkably casual about what's happening. We also get flashbacks to Aziz's life in Algeria, where he - mistaken for another man - falls in with a band of mercenaries before escaping....again,  Aziz seems carried along by events. Anyone not familar with Algerian politics will have a hard time figuring out some of these scenes.  <br /> <br />I thought the end of the book was the weakest, as point-of-view ping pongs between several characters, including the FBI, and characters from early in the book are suddenly reintroduced.  <br /> <br />Still, I think HARBOR is a very promising debut, and I hope Adams continues to tackle subjects of such relevance.	2004-09-12

Set in the late Carter/early Reagan era in Chicago, several characters from three families are overlapped in a number of storylines...Langer's greatest achievement is with the child characters, who are all rendered with great humor and compassion. My favorite was the smart-ass Michelle Wasserstrom, who overachieves despite herself and has most of the book's best lines. Also,  I loved Muley Willis, the lovelorn filmmaker who is forced to grow up too fast. <br /> <br />\\"California\\" refers to a street in a heavily Jewish neighborhood of Chicago...socioeconmic status is conferred depending on which side of the street one lives on, but since all the characters are constantly interacting I lost track of what where everybody lived meant.

The man who gets killed is the husband of Hannah Smith, who will become Ford's lover and the most compelling female figure in the series to date. Hannah is slightly idealized but still great fun, and gives the novel a lot of spark, especially in the absence of Ford's sidekick Tomlinson.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend CAPTIVA and this entire series, starting with SANIBEL FLATS.

The action of the plot concerns the death of a young girl in the Tamassee River, which is located in Oconee County, SC and protected by federal law. The girl's body becomes trapped in the dangerous river and the small community around the river becomes a flashpoint for a confrontation between environmentalists and the grieving parents.  <br />  <br /> Maggie, a newspaper photographer, returns to the town where she grew up to cover the story. She soon becomes entangled in old relationships with her dying father (towards whom she feels much unresolved anger) and the brooding Luke (an ex-lover and militant environmentalist). To oversimplify, this novel is sort of a &quot;You can't go home again or can you&quot; story. Maggie's attitude towards her family and the river evolves over the course of the novel and Rash wisely leaves her conflicting web of emotions unresolved after her photograph of the grieving father changes the course of the story.  <br />  <br /> I highly recommend this book with its economically drawn yet vivid characters and love of place. Rash's men tend to be too sensitive by half, but that's a minor distraction. Ron Rash is a name all readers of new fiction should watch for.	2004-07-21

The case looks airtight, but then a possible link to a serial killer arises, as does the possibility that Samantha's lover (a cop) may have put an innocent woman in jail. <br />Much of the book details the legal maneuverings around the rape case, and there's quite a bit of description of legal procedures that will be familiar to anyone who has seen a couple of episodes of Law &amp; Order. At times I thought the book dragged, but I enjoyed being in the company of these characters and the final plot twist is genuinely exciting. I look forward to reading more from this author.	2004-05-22

With four other detectives, he's assigned to work an old unsolved murder - ostensibly to relearn the value of teammwork. Meanwhile back in Edinburgh, Rebus' partner and friend Sibohan is working on a high profile investigation of her own. Of course, all is not as it seems...<BR>     John Rebus is a brooding, driven cop who relieves stress by listening to rock n roll and of course drinking. I think he's a close spiritual Scottish cousin to Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch, and I recommend Rankin to all Connelly fans. Rebus family life, his ability to trust, and his personal relationships are all affected by his job , yet he does it anyway. He's one of those fictional homicide cops who &quot;speak for the dead&quot;, like Bosch or Frank Pembleton. All fans of police novels with atmosphere should like this series. An interesting subplot involves Sibohan, who worries she may be headed down the same road as Rebus. I highly recommend RESURRECTION MEN and this series.	2004-05-15

The ex-cop turned private detective is commuting between LA and Vegas to see his daughter and elusive wife Eleanor. By books end he has made a life-changing decision and seems to have found a new sense of purpose. <BR>     This novel is Michael Connelly's lolapalooza, combining characters and plot lines from several previous books. The main thrust involves Bosch stumbling into an FBI investigation of the &quot;Poet&quot;, the killer in Connelly's book of that name. Bosch teams up with FBI agent Rachel Walling to pursue the Poet through the Nevada desert. There are twists and false endings, all delivered with Connelly's impeccable narrative logic. <BR>     More than any other crime writer I can think of, Connelly deals with way law enforcement professionals are driven to right the wrongs they encounter and speak for the victims. Also, how work defines the lives of these men and women, sometimes curtailing their personal lives. This book marks a turning point in Connelly's work, and fans can only wonder in what direction this series will now head. Essential.	2004-05-09

The murder victims are all caricatured as leering idiots <BR>     A deputy FBI director is put in charge of the case and for much of the book seems to be one of only 2 competent people in the bureau, along with his young sidekick. The FBI director, for no particular reason, is made into a preening buffoon. CAPITAL CRIMES is filled with improbabilities. One character repeatedly ignores communications about the identity of the killer, and the killer himself publishes his intended targets on a website. A subplot involving a British raid on the web server goes nowhere. There's nothing the least bit original or interesting in this book. Skip it .	2004-04-27

Most of the chapters are framed around a single meeting, but contain digressions which sometimes encompass other famous figures. <BR>     What are we to make of this unique, celebratory, and quite often infuriating work? Each chapter is backed up by Rachel Cohen's source notes, detailing the basis for the events and behavior described. Yet, throughout the book there's a curiously speculative tone, Cohen describes many of her beloved figures as &quot;maybe&quot;  doing or thinking this or that. In the opening chapter, Henry James (then a young boy) is described as feeling a &quot;persistent uneasiness&quot; while eating ice cream after having his portrait taken by Matthew Brady. Cohen notes this episode is invented, but then one must ask, &quot;Why is this important?&quot; Surely a book very much like this could have been written without such flights of fancy? <br />     Indeed, several chapters fail to coalesce at all. In a chapter on Willa Cather and Sarah Orne Jewett, Cohen asserts that the fact Cather did NOT meet Henry James changed the artistic direction of her career. How can this be proven? In most of these vignettes, no direct suggestion is made of how the characters influenced each other. Cohen is edging away from history and criticism and dangerously close to short fiction here. The book picks up in the last third, with some gossipy stuff about Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop and a funny scene of Marianne Moore and Muhammad Ali together, but the whole thing is much too ephemeral. The photographer Richard Avedon provided several photos - he's thanked in the acknowledgements - but did he deserve to be included in the title of several chapters? It's not as if the people he photographed (Langston Hughes and Carl Van Vechten, for example) hadn't met before. <BR>     A suggestion: readsome of the books Cohen sites in her bibliography instead of A CHANCE MEETING.	2004-04-18

The setting is a world very much like but not entirely our own. Lyra, a young girl raised in the halls of an Oxford college, is hurled into a massive effort by the Church to reverse original sin (called \\"Dust\\"). The plans involve kidnapping children and separating them from their daemons, the animal projections of their soul.<BR>     Both of Lyra's parents are involved in the effort to understand Dust, and indeed Lyra's father may have discovered a portal to another world.  THE GOLDEN COMPASS is often marketed to young adults, but the concerns are really adult. At what moment do we \\"grow up\\", how do we change? What is it that separates adults from children? There's high adventure but also a philosophical journey, and I look forward to reading the second & third volumes. Highly recommended.	2004-04-13

Ford, a marine biologist and ex-secret agent, is pulled into trouble when a friend is accused of murder. The case is tied to some shady dealings involving land and the Floridian environment-destroying building boom.<BR>     Ford mourns for a lost Florida, everywhere he goes the state has been overrun by tourits and developers. He's trying to hide at a quiet marina, but (like his forefather Travis Mcgee) can't resist a friend in need. White's description of Florida's nature is wonderful. The villain is sort of a stereotypical nut job, but Ford's quiet heroism makes up for it. Recommended.	2004-04-04

The book is loaded with action and twists, and while some may find it perfect beach fare, it's full of holes and improbabilites. Part of the plot involves an untrained professor being sent on a secret mission by the NSA, and some of the mistakes made by NSA staff seem ridiculous. <BR>     The book is full of paranoia about the government tapping into our email and other communications. Many people's views on these things have changed since DIGITAL FORTRESS came out in 1998, which lends the book an unfortunate dated quality, as f it had been written in the '60s..... not as good as DA VINCI	2004-04-01
US	47861594	R1CFWD89QP2FZ8	0316608971	863990662	Hard Revolution: A Novel	Books	4	1	1	N	N	excellent	In HARD REVOLUTION, George Pelecanos takes Derek Strange (hero of his three previous books) back in time to age 13, and then up through his early 20s to 1968. Much of the book involves the choices that Derek and his older brother Dennis make, and by extension, choices that face young economically disadvantaged men in the inner cities. Derek, after being caught shoplifting, vows to stay on the straight and narrow and eventually becomes a cop.  Dennis, who does have good intentions, falls in with two friends planning a crime spree. <BR>     Pelecanos is often categorized as merely a &quot;crime&quot; writer, but let's give him more credit than that. Who else is writing with such clear-eyed intensity about the difficulty that black and white have understanding each other? This theme is explored further in RIGHT AS RAIN and the other Derek Strange novels. Derek's father works under a white boss at a diner...the two men have a long relationship but are still awkward with each other. Derek finds that his white partner, despite his liberalism, doesn't really understand the experience of being a young black man.<BR>     Derek commits a violent act in HARD REVOLUTION, during the climactic riots after the Martin Luther King assassination. This act, which resonates in the earlier Strange novels, prompts him to find a more meaningful way to be a part of his community  and really changes his entire life. Pelecanos has come to own DC the way Connelly and Crais owns LA and Parker owns Boston....Highly recommended, but try RIGHT AS RAIN first.	2004-03-27

What ties everything together is the contrast between Olivia's life in Hollywood and the life of her sister, who is married and still lives in their hometown. Olivia has independence, but must constantly struggle for professional advancement while trying to convince her lover she won't give up her career for him. Olivia doesn't quite know where she fits anymore into her close knit Midwestern family and is troubled by wondering if she's been a good enough sister/daughter.<br />  Olivia's story feels fresh and relevant, the parts of the book involving DON QUIXOTE didn't wotk as well for me. The choice of DON QUIXOTE felt a little heavy handed-- why couldn't it have been a remake of THE MALTESE FALCON or FULL METAL JACKET? There's nothing new in the inside Hollywood stuff-- did you know studio execs are self obsessed and worried about money?<br />  Still, this is worth it and I look forward to seeing what this author does in the future.... recommended.	2004-03-21

Ms. Wallace and Spenser don't see eye to eye, and after she fires him, she gets kidnapped. Spenser spends the rest of the book looking for her. <BR>     I've read almost all of these books, and this one contains I think the best description of Spenser's personality,when Susan compares him to Sir Gawain. There's some comedy in the early scenes with the juxtaposition of Spenser and Rachel, but Rachel is characterized a little broadly, humorless and cranky. Spenser figures out the mystery pretty early on and spends the rest of the book trying to find Rachel. This is worth a couple of hours of your time on a Saturday afternoon.	2004-03-19

The Boston PI is trying to get the goods on a cheating husband when the husband turns up dead. This leads Spenser to a series of intrigues involving wife-swapping at a &quot;power selling&quot; company and a contoversial radio psychologist. <BR>The stakes are a little low here, the villains are too buffoonish to do more than confuse Spenser for little while, and the client is a bit of shrew. Old fans of this series will enjoy Spenser's warmly erotic relationship with his longtime love Susan and his friendship with loyal sidekick Hawk. Parker' s droll humor is on display and he has a way with how men talk to each other. If you're an old fan, you'll enjoy this, but if you're new to this series, start with an old one like EARLY AUTUMN or LOOKING FOR RACHEL WALLACE.	2004-03-15

Suzanne Vale, a medium-famous actress and daughter of the indomitable Doris, is a single mother reeling from being left by her husband Leland, who is gay. The book chronicles Suzanne's struggles with manic depression and some fairly bold drug use, told with the sense of humor of someone who realizes how silly the \\"business of show\\" is.<BR>      Events don't occur so much as coalesce around Suzanne, who narrates in a addled stream of consciousness style. A disatrous drug fueled trip to Tijuana and a stay in a mental hospital are harrowingly sketched and are the main set pieces of the book. I enjoyed seeing Suzanne through to a slightly ambiguous but hopeful ending, in which she forms a slightly different kind of family. Some of the secondary characters are thin and there's nothing new in the sending up of Hollywood life, but THE BEST AWFUL is a survivor's story by someone who has earned the right to tell it.	2004-03-02

Admiral Jake Grafton (Coonts' longtime hero) and his team are on the trail of nuclear warheads that terrorists plan to detonate in America. There are numerous double crosses and shifts in point of view, all of which makes for a cant-put-it-down type situation. <BR>Coonts clearly takes the view that institutional infighting in Washington is hampering the war on terror, and indeed Grafton gets the presidential go-ahead to circumvent the CIA and FBI. The heads of the various agencies aren't held in very high esteem here, and Grafton usually manages to accomplish things despite them. Grafton is a man of action, not a windbag like a character in a Tom Clancy novel. The action moves along briskly, and I felt like I was right there during the climactic scene at the Statue of Liberty. <BR>Even though I don't agree with all the politics here, I enjoyed LIBERTY and will be reading more by this author. Recommended.	2004-02-15

The story is told from the point of view of Willie Traynor, a young northerner who comes into town and buys the struggling local paper for a song, turning it into a fountain of liberalism the Watergate-era Washington post might have trouble keeping up with. <BR> Danny Padgitt, the accused, is sent off to priaon, vowing revenge on the jurors. Much of the second half of the book is devoted to Willie's crusading editorship, opposing Vietnam, exposing political corruption, etc. By the time Padgitt turns up again and people start dying, the town (and the readers) have almost forgotten about him. Instead, we're treated to interminable descriptions of the Southern cooking and homespun wisdom of Miss Callie, a matriarch of the black community whom Willy befriends. The black characters in THE LAST JUROR are one-dimensionally virtuous and could easily be spun off into some sort of Hallmark Hall of Fame movie. More troubling are the female characters, who are either regular churchgoers or slutty, without exception. Susan Sarandon's character from THE CLIENT could have straightened things out in 100 fewer pages. <BR>At least, I thought as I read, THE LAST JUROR lacks the cynicism that pervades Grisham's recent work, but in the end Willie doesn't seem to care about very much, other than the money he might make from selling the paper.	2004-02-08

I think it's here, though, that Lippman's heroine Tess Monaghan really comes into her own. Tess is a bright, underemployed woman on the cusp of 30, refreshingly free of personal demons or substance abuse problems that plague so many P.I.'s . The plot involves the death of a man trying to bring an expansion sports team to Baltimore and a mysterious racing greyhound belonging to Tess's uncle. In much of the book, Tess is placed in relief against what she thinks she wants: A successful journalism career (like her best friend), a promising boyfriend (instead of the young musician she's dating), etc. Lippman has written not just a good mystery, but also a novel of a young woman coming of age. I look forward to more of Tess. Recommended, along with BALTIMORE BLUES.	2004-01-27

Complicating matters is Webb's love for Donovan's widow Ellie.

We're not talking about making sure you buy the latest Britney album when it comes out, we're talking about spending lots of time, money, and social capital seeking out the one Guided By Voices seven inch you need to complete your collection. The book is full of anecdotes about people discovering something rare in a box of Lps in somebody's attic. Some of the collectors are famous (Peter Buck, Thurston Moore), but most are just regular guys (and a few gals) who have to navigate around a pile of Jeff Beck Japanese only Lps to get to the fridge. There are chapters about collecting imports, bubblegum pop, industrial records (&quot;Got to Investigate Silicone&quot;)  and also an attempt to explain why collectors collect. (Hint: serotonin)<BR>My one complaint is that almost all of the collectors discussed in this book are either musicians, music writers, or record execs. How about some pointers for the beginner? Still, very enjoyable for music fans.	2003-12-30

First is an espionage thriller set in early 1960s Berlin, just before the Berlin Wall went up. Also, and more importantly,  SECRET FATHER is a moving meditation on fathers and sons, and the things that make meaningful communication between them difficult. <BR>The story concerns three teenagers:Michael Montgomery, Kit, and Ulrich (a German). They journey to East Berlin to see a May Day parade, flush with youthful energy. Michael and his father, an American banker, split narrative duties. Carroll cuts between the kids (betrayed and arrested) and Mr. Montgomery's alliance with Ulrich's mother to try to win their sons' freedom. Complicating matters are the fact that Ulrich's mother is now married to an American spy and that Ulrich now possesses a mysterious film cannister everyone seems to want. <BR>The idea of fathers and sons knowing each other recurs throughout. The identity of Ulrich's real father is important, as is Michael's strained relationship with Mr. Montgomery. In a moving coda set just after the Wall falls in the '80s, Ulrich makes sure HIS son will know his father, even if he may not be around. Highly recommended.	2003-12-23

Author Margot Peters provides, in exhaustive detail, the histories of the Lunts many successful stage productions, mostly by now underremembered writers like Noel Coward and Robert Sherwood. Throughout their careers, the Lunts enjoyed good reviews from New York critics but were often chastised for choosing inferior plays. Even though I enjoyed learning about the Lunts, I didn't really understand what would have led them to make these choices after reading the book. <BR>Peters also comes up a bit short when discussing the Lunts acting technique... (she shouldn't be faulted too much or this though, working from secondary sources). Repeated references are made to how they made everything seem \\"fresh\\" and \\"spontaneous\\", but we don't know how they really got their teeth in a character.<BR>Peters notes that other biographers of the Lunts have claimed that both Alfred and Lynn engaged in gay relationships without providing any evidence. Peters also provides no evidence, but also provides no evidence that the Lunts had any intimate life with each other. After reading DESIGN FOR LIVING, I came away feeling that I knew the Lunts well as actors but very little as people. Probably how they would have wanted it.	2003-12-07

This is a big, lovingly written book about pre-gentrification New York, the effects of an absent parent on a child, and the end of a particular subgenre of African-American music. (and that's just for starters)...<BR>What's right: all the little things, the cracks and crevices of the sidewalk outside Dylan's house, the importance of ritual in the stickball games, the realtionships of the bullies to the bullied on Dylan's block, and the best way to store issue #1 of a comic book. The city, the music, and the drugs change as Dylan gets older and it seems Lethem was there for it all. <BR>The central relationship between Dylan and his neighbor Mingus is a bit problematic. Mingus isn't really knowable (perhaps by design), and soon disappears into a cloud of cliche(drugs, prison). By the time Dylan reaches adulthood, it's not clear what hold Mingus still has on him, and the implication of a homosexual attraction feels last minute. The imparting of superpowers to a ring Dylan is given also doesn't quite come off. It's not clear what Lethem is trying to do here, other than parody the kids fondness for comic books.<BR>Still, a novel wriiten with great affection, lives lived honestly, and a journalistic eye for detail. We need more novels (almost) like THE FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE.	2003-11-23

Maraniss crosscuts between the &quot;Black Lion&quot; soldiers in Vietnam, about to walk into a horrible ambush through a combination of bad luck and bad decisions; and the protests against Dow Chemical on the University of Wisconsin campus. We also get glimpses inside the White House as anti-LBJ sentiment reached critical mass, and into the North Vietnamese Army. <br />The idea of awakening and awareness recurs throughout. College students are radicalized in Wisconsin, while romantic notions of combat are pushed aside in the horrors of war. <BR>   The individual stories are most affecting, especially that of a soldier who returns alongside a former enemy to tour the old battlefield. Maraniss is a journalist, and most interested in the samll ways that people's lives were affected by those catalysmic times.  Excellent.	2003-10-31

Peter and Rina are relegated to supporting roles here, with the spotlight going to Peter's impetuous daughter Cindy. The plot involves the reopening of an old murder case, so there are a few too many scenes of cops sitting around hypothesizing. I gather that Judaism is an important element of the series, but here the section on Jewish rituals and the trip to the synagogue seemed to slow things down a bit.     Several male cops seem to antagonize Cindy, at some points I had trouble keeping track of who was who. Kellerman could have used some judicious editing in the last third of the book. Still, she clearly knows her police procedure, and what a relief to see a long running mystery series go in a new direction. (Are you listening Patricia?) Fans of this series should enjoy this, rookies should go back and start with THE RITUAL BATH.	2000-09-26
